alcoholism,f1zx96z,t3_dav60z,1569851696.0,"""Enough is never enough""

That's one of the truest thing.

I was going through this endless cycle of getting messed up, in the mornings, after work. I would pass out and wake up feeling absolutely dreadful and would have to force myself to get to work. I would tell myself ""*I am not going to drink this time. I feel terrible*"" But half-way through the night, I seem to catch my energy and start to feel better. I get home and I decide to drink again.

This cycle would continue and I drank, in excess, nearly every single day for over a year. I constantly thought about alcohol. Started drinking, on my breaks, at work. I couldn't get out of the house, drive, or do simple errands without drinking first.

I'd say that it was the absolute worst part of my life. It was definitely difficult realizing that I needed to stop. I remembered feeling depressed thinking ""*If I can't drink, how will I be happy?*"" I've been sent to the hospital by police and medics quite a few times because I tend to get depressed and say that I'm going to harm myself when I drink way too much. It would seem like a ""normal"" morning (*as in I would drink, get drunk and go to bed*). But, sometimes I would end up waking up in the hospital with a bac of around .40 - .45 and find myself cuffed to the bed on suicide watch. My wrists would be all cut up from the cuffs when I would get into a drunken rage.

This is no way to live at all. I know that I shouldn't live like that, but I can't understand why I allow myself to keep doing it. I am sober, now, and I've been keeping myself busy with work and computer hobbies, but I hope I can remain sober and not allow myself to slip again. The thought of the terrible things I've done, while drinking, is usually good enough to help stave off cravings. But, I still get those feelings of temptation.

I basically try to **keep myself busy** when I can and I also find that **changing my routine also helps**. I'd recommend switching some things around in your daily routine different from what it's normally like when you're drinking. I've recently resumed work on programming my own website that I put off due to drinking. I started a new video game level design project now that I'm sober and that's coming along pretty well. [(What I've been making)](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/876377847420316324/B59F8CCB28A32DC599B74BB4436E956984613603/)

I'm definitely a lot more productive and creative being sober

If you haven't tried going to an AA meeting, maybe try going to one. I've been going to a decent place on Friday evenings, but I don't go every Friday though. I mostly go there to listen because I'm usually pretty quiet, but I do like to share things sometimes. I also thought about seeing a therapist (I was recommended to) in hopes of trying to better understand why I drink and what really causes it. I'm still having a hard time understand why I do it.

Hope everything goes well for you and try coming back to Reddit if you are having problems. I'm still new to this so I mostly read others' comments for advice too."
alcoholism,f1bde8q,t3_d8bqyh,1569331682.0,"When I went into this smoke shop that I normally go to, the cashier was already pulling out a bottle for me because I would go there pretty much every morning after work. I said ""no thanks, I'm fine"" and he sounded all surprised about it. If I do slip, again, I'd be too embarrassed to go back. Hopefully I don't slip again. I pretty much had this little system going on where I had 4 places I could get my drink from and then I would cycle between each place just so they wouldn't see me come in every single day or twice a day (like I used to)."
alcoholism,f16uw4y,t3_d75x42,1569224932.0,"After I got sober, I began getting into RPGs a bit. I really enjoy playing Fallout, the Elder Scrolls games and others. I've still played games when drinking but normally FPS like old style Quake 2 deathmatch with a still active community, but I'm a lot better at it sober and I still play Quake. I couldn't play RPGs and remember things when I was drinking. But I'm able to retain memories a lot better now."
alcoholism,f13cjrj,t3_d7obbo,1569158207.0,"Nope! Once I start, I can't stop. I could drink one day after being sober for over a month and before I know it, I'm back to drinking every single day."
alcoholism,f0xifk6,t3_d6sdhj,1569033690.0,"Alcohol can be pretty rough on the body especially after you become physically dependent on it. The first time I went through withdrawal was one of the worst experiences (besides tooth pain maybe) I've gone through. It got to the point that I was drinking almost a pint a day. I would get sick if I hadn't had a drink in over 4 hours or so. Thinking back on those times is really depressing. Trying to maintain sobriety is the best thing that I've done for myself, but I still get moments of cravings and deal with depression sometimes. I've never seen anyone about my anxiety or depression yet. I did slip back into drinking about 4 months ago after I've been sober for over a year. Today I'll be sober for 22 days.

As another user said, maybe a psychiatrist can help you with deal with any issues that cause you to drink and use other substances. Finding the root of the problem could help you improve and you would feel so much healthier if you stop drinking. Weed would probably be better than everything else, but everyone's different. I used to smoke everyday but I couldn't do it anymore and haven't smoked in 6 years."
alcoholism,f0xhkku,t3_d6wif8,1569032884.0,"I get cravings many times, thinking about that warm feeling it would give me. But, to combat it, I think of the consequences that would come from relapsing again. I've have a lot of bad experiences due to drinking and I used to think just one drink wouldn't hurt and that I could control it, but I could never control it.

Some people would say  ""Oh just have a couple drinks and that's it. Just drink in moderation"" That doesn't work for ""people like us"", lol. One drink could give me a small buzz and make my body feel warm, but I didn't want to feel a little good. I wanted to feel really good and maintain that feeling. So, when I drink with the intention of only having 1 or 2 swigs, it ends up being half a bottle or more until I pass out. I used to get those little airplane bottles only to find myself going straight back to the store and buying a bottle.

But whenever I get cravings and imagine what it would be like to drink again, I tend to resume any projects that I've been working on. I try to make sure I have activities that keep me occupied. I've got a decent variety of projects/tasks so I don't get burned out doing the same thing everyday."
alcoholism,f0upj79,t3_d6ksq0,1568947026.0,"26 here. I've been to AA a few times after sobering up and I can relate to the whole thing about it revolving around god. Being agnostic, I find it hard to fit in but I kept going every Friday to listen to others' stories and to keep myself occupied with something. I haven't gone in a while though. One of the things that helps me to not go out and buy any is to think of the bad things that happened, in the past, because of drinking. Thinking of some of those things, from the past, makes me shudder. I have some ""I'm so lucky"" moments that could have ended very badly. Almost got a DUI, sent to the hospital too many times. The blackouts and doing things I wouldn't remember is another thing that frightens me and I'd usually end up in the hospital during a blackout because I would go bonkers and say things I would never say when sober.

Improvement of my health is another thing that helps keep me from doing it. I don't wake up with massive headaches anymore. I have more energy, my work performance has definitely increased and I don't miss anymore.

Keeping myself occupied with hobbies and cleaning house too. I do a lot of projects on my computer (programming, making PC game maps, dabble with music a little, etc). Playing games is pretty satisfying for me too. I'm a computer geek. Plus, I've got my two kitties which keep me some company when I'm home especially after the ex left while back.

It's hard to say exactly what will work because everyone is different, but I'd try changing things in your life such as your daily routine. Switch some things around and make a list of activities that you would find enjoyable and/or productive. You got this!"
stopdrinking,eyxkzr1,t1_eyvo7wn,1567556005.0,"Yeah, I'm sure some of the neighbors seen me removed from my home and put in the ambulance. I don't like to think about it because it is embarrassing. When one of the neighbors asked what happened, I said I was very sick.

I mostly do computer related projects when I'm not working. Having a routine is a good thing, but also add other activities to fall back on, in-case you get bored of the same thing. I like to add some variety.

I work full-time, but I've had the whole weekend off + labor day, so it's going to be weird going back to work after working 6 nights a week for 3 months. Plus I'll most likely have to talk to my supervisor tonight.
My dad and him talked about my problem when my dad was at work during the nights I was in the hospital. We work at the same place, just different positions. But I go back to work tonight. 

I swear I feel anxiety building up when I start to run out of things to clean. I was recommended seeing someone for anxiety because it seems to be an issue for me a lot, but I'm not sure what I should do about that."
alcoholism,eyvjoaw,t3_cyjjch,1567497670.0,"I definitely know how you feel. I've been sober for over a year up until 3 months ago when I started back up. I kept thinking ""maybe I can control it"" but obviously that didn't work out too well when I started drinking everyday again. Then about 5 days ago I lost control of it and woke up in the hospital on suicide watch. It felt like an eternity laying in that bed (wasn't allowed to use my phone) so I just laid there thinking non stop about what I will do once I get home. I felt pretty upset with myself, but all I can do is get back up and try again. Loneliness really relates to me because I don't go out much and meet new people. I do have a few very close friends that I can talk to about drinking.

What I would do is make a list of things to do which will keep you occupied. When I got home, I worked on a task list of everything I needed to do around the house. I fell behind on cleaning and everything when I was drinking. It definitely kept me busy and my place looks really great now. I also wrote down a list of all my hobbies I like to do. 

 One of the other things that helps me avoid temptation is to think back on the times I ended up in the hospital after saying things I didn't mean (which is what got me put on suicide watch) or blacking out and waking up in the hospital. My greatest fear is that I'll do something I would terribly regret and wouldn't even remember.

Just try to keep yourself busy and active. Hang out with a friend who is sober and if you feel comfortable, you can try going to a group meeting. You don't have to say much and you can listen, if you want, because that's what I pretty much did, when I first went, since I'm pretty quiet. I met a few good people in the group I would go to.

Get a notebook and write down things you want to work on whether it's goals, big or small projects, etc. Make a list of things to do that will help keep your mind from it. I write in a journal sometimes too. I'd try keep busy and do anything that takes your mind away from being tempted like video games or cleaning stuff, for example.

If you happen to slip again, think back on why it happened and adjust so it's less likely to happen. Drink water too!

Hope you're feeling better!"
stopdrinking,eyvbenl,t3_cyw8ka,1567487134.0,"I feel the same way every time I get sober sometimes. I was sober for over a year and everything was going well up until 3 months ago. I ended up losing control 5-6 days ago, blacked out at my computer, and  woke up in the hospital on suicide watch cuffed on all fours because I went mad. But I got out Thursday night and the next day I basically spent all weekend cleaning my place up, catching up on everything I fell behind on. But now that I'm pretty much done cleaning, I'm trying to find other things to do to keep me occupied, but it's difficult sometimes. I do get stressed because there's a lot of stuff I want to do, but being 4 days sober I still feel a little crappy after drinking to excess everyday for a month.

I grabbed a blank hardcover notebook to use as a task manager with check boxes. I categorized subjects with colored sticky book markers (kind of like sticky notes, but more narrow) So I'd have a section for Home Tasks, Errands, Personal Projects(hobbies), Long Term Goals and Miscellaneous. The long term goals I have are things that I work on a little at a time to accomplish such as reaching a goal in my savings account.

But that's what I do. I just make myself a nice task manager from a notebook. Or you could use Wunderlist, on your phone, to keep track of tasks and the app even sends email reminders of things you have a deadline for."
AskReddit,ewyb1i9,t3_ce600k,1565877969.0,"I get bored, at work, and read Reddit threads about weird human interactions and a lot of threads about ""police officers of reddit, what was/is..."" questions. But I have a couple.

There was this one guy I knew at my old job, at a supermarket. I guess we were kind of friends at work (I'm usually quiet and keep to myself and do my job). He seemed like a normal guy and he was older than me, but I don't know how old (me being 22 at the time). Then his behavior changed over a period of time. He was sitting with me, when I was smoking outside on break, and we were talking and then he, out of nowhere, brought up a topic of a customer (female) that he apparently liked but was upset when she didn't want to ""go out with him"" and he punched the wall in frustration. I just sat there and barely said anything except ""damn that sucks man, well you can always try others""

Then after a while I'd heard this rumor go around, I was one of the first people to know because my gf (at the time) heard from someone else that he said he wanted to kill this female coworker, that he was obsessed about, then rape her after. HR never fired him because of no proof of what he said. I never saw him the same after that and he did get fired shortly after though. He messaged me about a month later saying that all of them were lying and asking me if I disagreed with them. I never responded back and never heard from him again. Then removed him from my contacts a while later.

Then there was another guy that was just a creep/perv. He was sitting with us (the group I always sat with at work right beside my ex) and he, out of nowhere, said ""I wonder what (that girl's) color her underwear is"". I never cringed so fucking hard in my life. It was painful. All of us just stared at him (we sit at a circular table) for a moment. Then one of the guys said something like ""Dude you should get therapy, you can't say things like that."" Plus he would peek, for minutes at a time, at my ex and other girls until she brought it up to me.

A lot of weird people at that place and even where I work now."
DippingTobacco,ewqe9v6,t3_cnex1z,1565663616.0,"Don't really have a once in a while kind of dip, but I mainly smoke at home and dip at work. We get one short break for the whole shift so I can't really smoke much. But I've originally started using Skoal mint-extra, but just got a tin of Grizzly Long-Cut Mint to try out because I read that it hits a bit harder than Skoal."
AskReddit,ewo7d78,t3_bpz0q8,1565608979.0,"I'm an introvert myself and I still do have a hard time ""flirting"" with another lady. I use online dating sites now that I'm working at a place where it's impossible to meet new people, plus I work nights. So it's pretty difficult to meet someone who doesn't work nights like I do.

Instead of flirting, I just try to make a decent conversation and if she says something that is appealing, I'll compliment it and make her feel good. I won't straight up say she looks beautiful or pretty since I don't really know her that well. for example, a lady tells me ""I dyed my hair purple, but i got it on my skin and can't get it off"" I'll tell her that's cute and recommend a way to get it off (she works night-shift like I do and we still talk quite a bit). Honestly I don't exactly know how to flirt really, but I know she's definitely interested because she goes out of her way all the time to message me first, so that's a start hehe. :)

But it just depends on the person. I'm the kind that likes to take things slow and get to know someone. I've fooled myself a couple times with women, who I thought were actually interested in me and we got along great at first, but apparently they were just looking for a hookup and didn't want to get serious."
AskReddit,eqrh6zg,t3_ac0ipe,1560260839.0,"Stupidly, I decided to drink one morning. I wasn't messed up badly, but enough to screw me if I got stopped and I knew it too. I was getting groceries, driving my mum's car and I decided I wanted to go on a little joyride out in the country roads. I was going around a bend and saw the front of an suv patrol car and I felt my heart skip and I tensed up, said ""god damnit..I'm fucked, it's all over..."" and he turned his lights on before I even passed and he remained to keep them flashing. In a split second I decided whether I was going to stop or keep going. For all I know he was just warning me, but he kept his lights on and he lets off his brakes and whips around after I was maybe half a quarter mile past him. I decided that if I did stop, I'm screwed, and I thought I had too much to lose.

As I hit another bend and lost line of sight from him for a little bit, I smashed the pedal down, took the next right, then the next right, then a left and so on, going fast as I can and I realized I was lost. I never drove so fast in my life and I always go the speed limit, except for that stupid moment. I was used to most country roads being 55, but I was going a bit faster than that i don't remember how fast I was going when I approached him but I was going fast. I wasn't really used to driving this vehicle because it rides so smooth and I've always driven my older SUV which I can go the speedlimit without even having to look at the speedometer. So I took another right, whipped my sunglasses off, sparked a cig and pulled out my phone to ask google assistant to take me home. I made it home, brought my groceries inside and almost cried, but felt stupid as fuck about it. I can't believe I didn't get caught. It was definitely a huge wake up call for me.

I've had a bad history with alcohol abuse and still do, on and off."
