Logic Intelligence

Kinaesthetic Intelligence

Spatial Intelligence

Musical Intelligence

Interpersonal Intelligence

Intrapersonal Intelligence

I’d suggest you find a sleep schedule that works for you. Maybe start simple. Go to bed an hour earlier than before. Then keep on going to bed earlier. Personally, I plan on going to bed at 12:00am from now on. You should plan out what you’re going to do before bed. When are you going to brush your teeth, eat dinner, or play games.

ask,fmyh9jz,t1_fmyf5x2,1586486138.0,"My mom knows that I have depression and anxiety. I’ve told her I needed a therapist and she has listened a few times, but she hasn’t ever actually got me a therapist. She told my doctor about it, but he just sort of brushed it off and said that I could just be mistaking it or something. I think he did understand that teenagers go through this kind of stuff these days, but I just don’t think he took it that seriously in my case. He just said that “girls ruin their bodies because of this,” or something. He didn’t really think that I would do that kind of thing. I don’t know if my parents can afford a therapist either so I don’t think it’s a good idea... I feel like I’m asking too much of them. They already do a lot for me, so I feel like what I’m asking for is just selfish. It’s kinda stupid, but the thing is, I also want singing and guitar lessons, (which I assume is expensive,) because my passion is music and I wanna become a musician so bad... But I don’t wanna ask for too much from my parents. I feel like it’s greedy to want that from them. So far my mom is the only one who knows I’m depressed and the rest of my family just assumes that I’m lazy or I’m going through a stage or something. I don’t blame them, at all actually. Depression is really hard to understand if you don’t have it... that’s why I get offended and frustrated when my sis makes suicidal jokes like, “I’m gonna throw myself off a cliff,” or something along those lines. It frightens me and it worries me that she might actually feel that way too... I feel like maybe when I get older and go to college I’ll be able to sort my life out.

If I felt attractive and if I liked who I am as a person I don’t think I’d be as depressed as I am now. Before the whole quarantine thing happened, everyday after I came home from school I’d have suicidal thoughts, it’s just become second nature for me. When I’d have arguments with my mom, I’d go get a knife from the drawer and just hold it above my wrist until I calmed down. I’ve never actually cut myself, since I don’t consider what I’m going through as severe as other people have it, but I’ve come close. Sometimes I’d just dig my nails into my skin, that’s really the only harm I’m willing to do to myself"
ask,fmye60q,t1_fmydbdv,1586484056.0,"There’s only really been one incident where I was teased.. I wouldn’t say bullied. It wasn’t directly either, the person just implied it that way. I’m not sure how to explain it, but the interaction sort of went like this:

My friend called me “precious” since I always come across as innocent to other people, which I absolutely hate because I’m really the opposite of what they think I am.

And then one of my classmates said that “precious also means ugly.”

And that honestly hurt, I’ve never been called ugly before but I’ve always thought I was ugly so it just really hurt. And it doesn’t make sense either. When I was younger everyone would say that I look like a doll, and even now sometimes my family says I’m pretty. But I just don’t feel pretty and I don’t really think I am tbh. Even though he’s kind of a jerk it really did hurt. I just laughed it off when he said that and my friend just looked shocked but I really took it to heart.
