One tip from me, as it grows out so quickly, if you

Er what. To this day I don’t know which one of us was asleep. The floor was cold. His mum said ‘oh I thought I heard a scream.’ He said he woke up to me screaming and I thought when it stopped he was either on top of me or beside me.

I’ve had sleep paralysis loads back then but it was never, ever, ever like that. In episodes I am always firmly trapped in position, couldn’t get up to go to the toilet and skills so limited back the  I couldn’t have screamed unless I was awake..or having a nightmare and unaware.

IWantToLearn,fpn5h98,t3_gdxfg3,1588750923.0,"My husband is a closed book. Always has been. Ive always been very romantic, and with previous partners had emotional rollercoaster relationships, with burning fear and passion and love letters with beautiful words and...

He’s not like that. At first it felt like he didn’t love me. The only way I know he does is he says he does. That’s enough for him. He’s fairly avoidant in that there’s not much touch either. 

I love him and we work well together so I accepted long long ago that it’s just how he is. We never fight, he never argues with me. He accepts everything. It’s really grating as sometimes I just want him to tell me how he feels. 

It’s really, really hard. So hard that sometimes I’m dying inside just to feel wanted. To feel like I exist. Even after 10 years I do not know a single feeling he’s had about us. He has never cried. He just..likes a few things, has a job and plays games. We might discuss tv or what we will do next with the house. He will listen to me talk to him passionately and we have a great sex life. But I will never really know what’s going on in his head. It’s heartbreaking. Like being in a permanent state of not knowing if your boyfriend is about to break up with you. 

But he will never change. 

And I can’t really expect him to.

If you really are like this, accept that if it’s really that harsh to your partner either they aren’t the right person for you or you just both have to live with it.

If you think you can change, just tell them something. Anything. ‘I feel......x today.’ ‘I have this thing at work do
you think you could help me, I feel a bit worried about it.’ It’s about knowing how you feel inside that is the hard part. ‘I love you and you make me feel...’

The scariest part for me is that there isn’t anything inside. That he doesn’t have any feelings. 

What I don’t get is that it would be really easy to fake it and he could pretend to say nice things or..any things. But he doesn’t. Like i’m not even worth a lie.

I think the only thing you need to learn is how much this can hurt your partner if you don’t try. Follow those phrases I mentioned and change them to suit any given situation.

I have PTSD as I was raped and a lot of the time sex gives me images of what happened. But we can’t live like this. I can’t live without sex. It’s one of the few things in our relationship that actually make me feel wanted and cared about so I have to just get on with it.

Thing is I worry that I will get some weird PTSD from this if we ever break up. I will be a numb partner to anyone, thinking my life is just to be there as a sexy roommate that they spend time with but don’t talk to. 

Just...remember that PTSD can be handled. My therapist encouraged this therapy where I show myself the things that set me off. Eg if it was a photo of the time period I would look at it for a few seconds. Then longer. Watch a video. Do it once a month. Every week. Rather than avoiding what is the root cause you need to try exposing yourself to it in small quantities. So saying something like ‘you make me feel on top of the world’ surely couldn’t make you feel exposed? It’s about your current partner. Nobody else. It’s just about you.

But like wtf else would they need to get from you? Nobody needs to know about their partners past unless it’s relevant or they want to talk about it."

AskReddit,foy2dvi,t3_ga4gjx,1588163609.0,"I used to live with my aunt. I had a key to my bedroom as it was previously rented out. I have always been anxious so always locked it from the inside when I went to bed. I didn’t have many of my own things and the wardrobe still had most of her clothes in and her belongings were on top of the wardrobe. 

I woke up one morning and it looked like she has been sorting stuff out while I was asleep, which I felt uncomfortable with but she was letting me stay so I let it go. I stayed in bed looking at my phone for a while. Got up eventually and thought she must need some help so tried to pick them up. They were some heavy encyclopaedias that although Im pretty strong, I struggled to pick up so left them on the floor. 

I unlocked the door and went into the kitchen for breakfast and she was washing up so I was like oh did you need some help with the books? She was confused. The books. On the floor of my room. What books? The big encyclopaedias. You left them on my bedroom floor.

She said she hadn’t but had been looking for them and now remembered they were on top of the wardrobe. The big tall wardrobe that you can’t reach the top of without a stool, even me at 5ft 8. 

We went back in the room and then I got the creeps because I had had to unlock the door on my way out. So nobody could have got in. As it was still in the door! 

She said ‘oh meet xxxx, our ghost.’ Apparently my great aunt is always moving things. I still can’t explain it. I wasn’t even in a haze as I’d been properly awake.

But as much as I could have sleepwalked...I had no way of reaching them to get them down. The wardrobe was way too tall and there was no furniture in the room to stand on. Really freaks me out thinking about it."

My husband is at home working and I’ve lost my job. Yeah K don’t have screaming kids to deal with but I clean all day and deal with our food, the garden, try to salvage what little work I can (I can’t). 

He makes the time to spend 1hr with me at lunch. Or half an hour playing games and half hour with me. Most days he makes lunch. I will get consumed in an art project or writing and he will want to do something nice. 

Even though he works all day, he made a full roast dinner yesterday after work for us. He enjoys our family time. We used to just eat whatever junk was about and now we cook together using recipes. 

He folds laundry after work if he sees it lying around or will sweep the floor. 

I feel like i’m not enough and he has to do more but I think he just likes to do things together or make me smile. And he’s really busy. Like lost a lot of pay, everyone on furlough so he’s doing everyone’s work busy. 

If mine can do that, yours sure as hell can give his own kids a bath while you make dinner or read them a story goodnight while you have 5minutes to yourself. 

I think I would stop bothering and wait until the house is a total tip and he’s not getting fed so he has to
do it himself. Sometimes they need to see that they are needed, but atm you are doing it all yourself and although asking for help still doing it all. If I ask for help
with folding clothes when I’m tired he would say he’s busy but if it’s left on the sofa all day and he sees i’ve not done it but he wants to sit and watch tv, that’s his queue to jump in and fold while his tv show is on. 

I wonder what would happen when your baby screamed and instead of running up to take care of him you pretended to sleep or just lay there and say I can’t do this anymore and cried. What if you were ill he would have to do it all himself then. Maybe he would jump into action. Imagine if you were so depressed you couldn’t get out of bed or wash, what would he do then. 

I think for your own sanity you might need to just stop being supermum for a bit and let him think that you aren’t coping (which as hard as it is you clearly are!!! Well done!!). Just to kick his ass into gear."

There will always be someone that saves up to get the affordable ones they want. They are careful with other things so they can have nails done once a week and their roots done.

The ones that will save and save and save just to get a basic thing done and be frugal. No go somewhere cheap per se but somewhere they know will do a good job, it will last well and they have other priorities so they would never get anything more than £50 ish even when having multiple things done. 

The ones that make it a priority and have less hobbies so they can look good all the time and relax, enjoy their life.

It’s not selfish to enjoy your life

It’s selfish to think that a person is selfish for not wanting kids.

I never understood it. I know plenty of people that are selfish by having them. One hasn’t worked a day in her life and makes £1200 off the government a month, no including her rent and bills paid for. She isn’t a mother because she loves kids, she’s a mother because she’s selfish and wants her rent paying.

Some get bored and have kids to entertain them or keep their minds occupied. That’s selfish to me.

Some don’t take care of their children’s needs. That’s selfish.

Whoever first said childless people are selfish probably was an a hole."

Could you get an old basketball out and twirl it on your finger?

Put on your favourite movie from when you were a kid? I can never not pay attention when a Christmas movie is on. 

Find an old history book you once read? I have this recollection of an encyclopaedia from when I was like 10 called how your body works and it used to blow my
mind with it’s silly facts. 

I did this thing last year where I would put the radio or a playlist on when I was in the shower. At first I hated it because I hate being wet. Then I would look forward to it as I just started singing. I can not sing well nor did I ever think I could enjoy that. Now I can’t damn stop and i’m singing the words to pavarotti every time they play him on the ice cream van. 

I’m not saying you’re going to suddenly like things. But you might just feel a warm memory enjoyment feeling. Which, to me, was enough for a long time."
SuicideWatch,fn85mo4,t3_fneywx,1586734409.0,"My therapist actually told me something of value. I’ve heard it many times before but I finally really heard it.

‘You have to learn to love what is good for you.’

It’s not about enjoying it. It’s about doing it. Over and over and over. It keeps you alive. 

I used to love to paint and swim and dance...drink vanilla frappes and go for walks.

Now I don’t like anything. But my body remembers what it’s like to be happy. When I make a frappe at home even though i’m too scared to go for a walk (long time issue), my body remembers the nice feeling of being with friends and smiling in a cafe. It remembers the pull my arms had to literally give me breath and life every stroke in the pool. It remembers that I paint beautiful pictures when I’m upset that I can be proud of even though getting through the painting is hard.

What would your body remember? What did you love once? Even if it was from when you were young"
SuicideWatch,fn84sz0,t3_fsmc3h,1586733906.0,"You quite honestly are keeping me alive right now. Just knowing what a burden i’d be during a time that is so hard for all of you in healthcare. You guys are stopping me swallowing pills or cutting my wrists and I will
do it for as long as I am able to do my bit. You are stopping people being on the roads and having less major accidents. You are stopping people doing stupid stuff in case they can’t see a doctor. Think of all the lives that might have been hit by a car had there been traffic. You are saving thousands just by your impact on the rest of us.

I can’t imagine what you are going through but you are so brave. While it’s early right now, the survival numbers will go up. They really will. I’d will be hard to believe I know, with so much death. There is a lot of death because everyone is still learning what the best thing to do is. No nurse or doctor ever did everything right the first time. Soon you will all be masters of keeping these people alive while they fight it. In china, they still had 70000 infected until very recently. It was only a few months ago it started and it’s only just start raising numbers everywhere else. The deaths came first in china. The survivors came a long time after as they took a long long time. But they did survive. 

Currently only 22% of cases have recovered due to the delay in recovery. But only 6% have died all over the world.

They took an educated guess for that the actual cases were about 40 times the ones reported due to being so mild and not being tested. People that recovered at home. So that makes it 0.01% of people have died. That is, as much as I panic and am freaked out and depressed..the odds are so good.

I know it’s hard. We are all fighting the fight with you, we just can’t be by your side in person, but we are right here.

For what is worth, you saved my life today. I came here planning on ending it, crying in bed.  Instead I wrote this and am going to go back to sleep. 

Thank you for saving my life."

DecidingToBeBetter,fn2loei,t3_fyo3b4,1586593666.0,"I think the hard bit, forgetting the relationship, is when one partner is disinfecting, keeping the place clean, being sensible to reduce contact and germs eg food shopping and deliveries and mopping after outside world items touch floor; but the other partner has just figured out hand washing and touches everything. Touches the bin and washes hands but neglects there are two gates and a door between inside and the bin.
 and we use the first gate and door a lot to take things out and tidy garden. Simple things to reduce infection that you’d think would be common sense...like not wearing socks on the kitchen floor while I’m unloading the food shop onto it and walking all over the kitchen and lounge and then going upstairs onto the carpet in the socks so if there was any virus particles, hoovering would mean blowing them all into the air so can’t hoover for 9 days. It’s excessive but by simply staying out of the room when i’m putting food away or leaving the door open and not touching the handle after putting bin out or even cleaning the handle, or washing hands when he’s working in the garden and using the gates...then none of the excessive stuff has to be done. 

I’m finding it really difficult to the point i’ve had breakdowns and crying over it. He apologises and says he will do better and that he’s trying. Then opens the door to a delivery guy less than 1m away and they talk to each other like they don’t have a care in the world.

COVID19positive,fmvrpk4,t1_fmvqxiw,1586428346.0,"You can’t really avoid it but I mean pertussis was way worse for me. I was frothing instead of getting air in and out with that.. this was different. More of a real
inconvenience, whereas the pertussis I thought I was dying every 5 minutes when the cough flared up. 

I think maybe I know my limits too well now and if I can breathe no matter how hard it is..it’s still an improvement on last year. 

I personally avoided breathing deeply as it was uncomfortable but there’s breathing techniques that help by breathing deeply and coughing face down. The only way I could really breathe well was by resting. They say not to lay flat in bed all day so I even spent some time just face down on a freshly hoovered carpet at some points. Got up and sat on sofa. Went and did some gardening. Went for a walk with face covered in open area so I could irritate my hay fever and get more moisture. Crying helped a lot. Made it harder to breath but getting all the worry and panic helped when flat as eventually I was just casually flat face down on the floor totally fine. 

As difficult as it was...it wasn’t bad enough that i couldn’t breathe. Only that it was like breathing in a straw. I’ve been worse.

You can take a lot more than you think. Omg I can’t breathe?’ Well. You are. Look. Listen. You are breathing right now. You will be just fine.

Even when you think it’s at its worst if someone else with you/in the next room is saying it to you, it makes you think it’s not as bad as it is. Well if they think i’m managing ok I will be fine. You relax. You breathe easier."
