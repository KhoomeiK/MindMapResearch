Irresponsible in that you're talking about it like it isn't a serious plant that should be respected, which leads people to take it willy nilly until they wind up finding the side effects the hard way. Things like this get suppressed on this sub and then there's a giant post on quitting kratom asking why they got withdrawals when someone said they don't exist, and everyone stayed silent on things like the negative effects of taking too much. It's a feedback loop and as someone dependant on this stuff for chronic pain, I don't want to see people winding up addicted to this stuff because the information they received was misleading. 

I take this stuff for pain too, 5.5g every 4 hours. If I doubled my dose or took even a gram extra, pushed my doses together closer, I'd get extremely sick. 12g was the max I was ever able to tolerate and the absolute peak of my heavy usage, for pain and not recreation I'd add. Someone coming off high doses of opioids might be able to tolerate 18g, or someone might be able to take 35g, but that doesn't make the suggestion any less dangerous. 

Yes, people can get sick from much less. Just because you don't get sick from that doesn't mean it's not a bad idea to suggest. 

12g is way too much for most people. People who might be reading a thread on the front page of their feed and looking for anecdotal info that won't send them into a fit of vomiting and feeling like death for 12 hours"

This is a wildly irresponsible way to use the plant, as 12g would have be clutching the toilet all night vomiting.

I don't think you should spread information when it's potentially dangerous. Not fatal dangerous, but sick as a dog dangerous for sure.
