Paranormal,fptsxqv,t3_gezbew,1588897625.0,"Sorry, long but my two OBE’s

Once I was in deep meditation and had an OBE. I saw this beautiful, tall man with long white hair, blue skin and he had these white and gold patterns/sigls on his skin. He made me feel really safe and I could hear his soft voice in my head. He tuck me to this vast white city that looked like it was made from silk, I could hear whispering all around me and I started to get freaked out. I turned around, he smiled at me but the whispering grow louder and I heard a gruff voice say “She shouldn’t be here.” 

After that I was slammed back into my body and didn’t meditate again. 

After that, I only ever had one other OBE and it was totally unexpected. I saw these things in the shadows and other people out of body. I was travelling really quickly, lights, cars, noise were zipping passed. Out of nowhere, this guy grabs my arm, tells me to look down and I see this iridescent thread coming from my stomach. He points to the shadows and tells me “If you stray too far from your body the connection could be broken and they will get in.” 

I could hear growling and grunts from the shadows and make out these grotesque skeletal beings. Anyways, I ended up in my friends bedroom and she turned over and saw me, just stood there. She asked “If I was ok and what had happened?” 

I can remember saying “I feel cold” and being slammed back into my body. My friend rang me the next day and said “WTF Happened last night? You were in my room and then, I just saw light and you were gone.”"

I got up to run towards the kitchen but stopped at the bottom of the stairs and there were two humanoid hounds with charred flesh, staring at me and laughing in a guttural tone that made my chest vibrate.
