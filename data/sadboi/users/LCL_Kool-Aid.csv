A lot of people think you'd explode. The Earth has 1 atmosphere of pressure at sea level. Outer space has 0 atmospheres. It would be painful, and you'd get the bends real quick.

What you'd die from is either asphyxiation, or exposure to unmitigated solar radiation. The latter being quick, at least."

Their belief in a god is set in them as a concrete truth, whether they understand it or not. It is foundational to their being, and they will defend it even when they're faced with confusing evidence.


The Christian Bible is full of verses to support those confronted with the fallacy of their belief.

Corinthians 1:19-25 is one great example of what you're trying to fight.

*For it is written: ""I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.""*

*Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?*

*For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.*

*Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.*

*For the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man's strength.*"
