2)  how long have you been on Adderall, and how long on this dose? Are you taking IR or ER?


3) what is your goal with re-sensitization? Is it something immediate and urgent like finals, or are you looking to be re-sensitized enough to last you through the whole semester until break?

Your mileage will vary greatly based on the factors above, so the answers are important :)"

Alright y’all, I’m gonna nerd out on you about this lol...

The families of the victims as well as a British professor who started a fundraiser finally wore the Russian Investigative Committee down. They even appealed to The Human Rights Organization. I believe the sister of one of the victims stated that it is her right to know what happened to her brother.

Yuri Yudin, the only survivor, has always maintained that there is absolutely no possibility that the tragedy was due to natural causes. He passed away at 75, and said that not a day went by when he didn’t think about his best friends and how they perished. 

There is a fear that the Russians will simply do a cursory “investigation” and declare it a death from natural causes just so they can close the case once and for all and get people off their backs.

After all, many pertinent documents that were classified have already “disappeared” long ago."

adhd_anxiety,ewinz84,t1_ewibhox,1565453305.0,"I feel you so hard on the Lexapro dilemma.

Lexapro saved my ass when I was an anxious wreck and in agony after my break-up. It numbed me and allowed me to slowly continue with my life and calmly put the pieces back together. However, I became too numb and sleepy and unmotivated, so now I’m on a very low dose. Lex is the one that takes away my anxiety and feelings of worthlessness, so I do need it, but I want to also experience negative emotions so I can deal with them, as well as some motivating anxiety. 

I used to be so afraid of negative emotions because I felt like I’d never come out of that hole. While numb, I ended up feeling like I was only scratching the surface of life, living in 2D. Not reacting appropriately to sad stimuli. Maybe a good analogy would be being on Xanax or something? Being human means experiencing a whole range of emotions. From pain and suffering divine art is born, transcendent books are written, incredible paintings are created. Without pain one cannot know real joy. 

Now, with therapy, I understand that bad feelings are transient and are simply a part of life. No emotion is “bad”, they’re your body/mind telling you something is wrong and needs to be addressed. Im not necessarily referring to the whole of depression, because it is an actual illness and partly rooted in biology, but emotions such as anger, sadness, disappointment, etc. it’s your mind signaling (trying to protect you in its own way, maybe because it learned in maladaptive ways) that you need to resolve an issue (maybe a criticism hurt you? Maybe you’re anxious about seeing your family? Maybe you lack sleep? Etc).

For me, I took antidepressants to help with some of the anxiety and depression that was situational. This then left me with ADD and the anxiety and depression (lack of motivation) that are due to ADD. 
Since depression and anxiety are co-morbid with ADD (2 sides of the same coin), to me it would make sense for the visual to show adderall fully knocking out the masked “depression” guy, and when the mask falls off, he realizes that the guy was actually ADD all along.

You’re absolutely right. I’ve read a lot of conflicting info, and I keep swinging one way and then the other, depending on which day of the week you catch me, lol. Like a flip flopping politician...

When it comes down to basic biochemistry, most citrus fruit become alkaline in the stomach, also alkalizing the blood pH and urine. Amphetamines are acidic, and thus have to compete with other acids to be absorbed. They don’t compete with alkalizing agents. 

At the end of the day, our stomach acid is much stronger than even 20 gallons of OJ. So if our stomach doesn’t nullify amphetamine, a couple of oranges shouldn’t either....at least that’s what I’m thinking.

I’m starting to believe that the whole Vit C thing inhibiting absorption is a myth, but then again, I’m still a bit agnostic about the whole issue. I’ve spoken with a couple of well-educated psychiatrists who claim that it’s a myth, but the whole internet seems to think the opposite. 

However, the makers of Vyvanse indicate, on their website, that the capsules can be taken apart and mixed with OJ to take in the morning. I’m on Vyvanse myself, so that really reassured me.

Fine, let’s go. Tell me allllll about these positive NDEs that everyone is fearfully hiding.

It isn’t fair to say that the body/brain of a person experiencing an NDE doesn’t take outside stimuli into account. For example, when people report floating above their bodies and seeing and hearing what the doctors are saying - that’s an outside stimuli, is it not? And most do report experiences based on the five senses- smelling odors, seeing light/dark, hearing voices/sounds/music, feeling pain/cold/heat/ someone’s touch, etc. 
The brain is what generates these. A “soul” or “spirit” doesn’t really interpret things biologically (I sure would hope).

A true NDE should then not have the five biological senses involved, because those are brain-generated, and biologically(bodily)-experienced. 

I bet the feelings of utter extasy or feeling one-with-the-world and having completely clarity can be quickly and easily reproduced by a double dose of Xtasy, or MDMA.

It’s all in our brain ¯\___(ツ)_/¯

Yeah, I’m up at night Redditing when I should be sleeping, lol."
NDE,erb7oju,t1_erb78bk,1560665261.0,"But one must consider the fact that these 10% are only the reported ones. Most people refuse to discuss them out of fear of being labelled as bad, or out of PTSD. 

If you told me that 1 out of 10 people dying in hospitals were dying of some weird disease, to me it would be high reason for concern. 
Same with this 10% estimate - I find it much too high to be brushed off. 

Think of it this way - that means probably at least two of your relatives dying from this ""disease"". At least three people in each grocery store you visit. One person from each row of a stadium - think of how many rows are in a stadium, and how many stadiums and grocery stores in the world.

I'd sure as heck be very interested to get to the bottom of such a phenomenon.

I could say - well, 10% of your family will likely experience this. Could be you, could be your sister/mother/son. Or maybe not, but the odds are 1 out of 10. Yikes..."
NDE,erb7dnl,t1_erb73xi,1560664871.0,"It reminds me of the exact same thing. I've also found that people in comas (especially medication-induced) typically report the most elongated and unpleasant experiences....so there's food for thought regarding how medications/drugs affect consciousness.

A Youtuber, now passed, explained her NDEs in vivid detail, but there was nothing out of the ordinary. Her medication-induced coma, however, was pretty vivid. She did explain that her hallucinations incorporated what was happening around her - they lowered her body to very cold temperatures, and she thought she was in Alaska, etc.

There's also a part of the brain responsible for out-of-body experiences. When stimulated by an electromagnetic device, it can make the subjects feel as if they're temporally located to the left of their body, or in front of it, etc."
NDE,erb3z39,t1_erb3vhq,1560660901.0,"I don't believe in hell, but I find your logic interesting. Would you argue that 5 out of 10 NDEs would have to be distressing in order to prove hell's existence? Because if hell existed, 50% of people would be heading there?"

NDE,eratpir,t1_emmuhwq,1560652704.0,"I just don't want to believe in a god who would create imperfect people, with apples and snakes and devils nearby, then fault them for ""falling from grace"" because they wanted apples and knowledge, and torture them for an eternity. We're being punished for wanting knowledge? Now what kind of message is that?

If god is a) omniscient, s/he would've seen the future fall of humankind.

If god is b) omnipotent, s/he would be able to create something without evil

If god is c) perfect, s/he couldn't create man in his/her image who would be imperfect. Perfection cannot create imperfection, and goodness cannot create evil.

If god is d) good, s/he wouldn't create such horror and evil that now roams the earth.

It follows to me that god is none of those things, but just an egomaniac. I refuse to worship or idolize such a creature. Even our Fathers have their own sins."
