depression,ewqpjgi,t3_cd0hjp,1565673681.0,"I know I'm not unique, but it feels that way. Each day is going to work so that tomorrow I can get up and go to work (so that I can make rich people richer - the beauty of Capitalism ah!). I see no value in this. Society sucks in so many ways! Hobbies I just see as distractions from the obvious stupidity of it all. It's all just shallow empty shit that goes on day after day. Nothing matters to another human being, including you.
Every 30 seconds someone takes their own life... And we wonder why?"

EliteDangerous,erubgxa,t1_eruadzx,1561270844.0,"I tend to do a few passenger runs from Robigo to Sothis Atmospherics if I feel like making money. You can do a round trip in 15min in a JumpaConda (1 jump each way which needs a min of 59.03ly), typically with 9 cabins (10 if you don't take a shield in an Anaconda) each paying around 2.5mil. So around 22mil per loop (80ish an hour fairly easily) assuming you don't take any of the Mats on offer as an alternative reward. You can do as few loops as you like, so you are not stuck doing something for a couple of hours. From Shinrarta it takes 7 jumps to get out to Robigo (~7min). It's dead boring too, but you don't have to think at all, so watch some videos on a second monitor if you have one. With cruise assist it's even easier. Just load the passengers into cabins, do the loop, rinse/repeat. Doesn't matter whether you take criminals or not, you are never scanned at Robigo. If I bother, I usually do it for an hour (out, 3 loops and then back to Shinrarta)."
philosophy,eru9jxn,t1_ertdcax,1561268380.0,"You seem to have a lot of faith in human nature... Mankind as a people are self-deceiving beyond any reasonable comprehension. Self-denial (of the facts) is the norm, not the exception. So I'm afraid I don't see much of a sliver of hope for Mankind. We will drive ourselves to extinction within another hundred years I suspect. By over population to the point of food and water famines, causing political chaos due to mass migrations, resulting in political and civil unrest and wars, and whatever is left will be wiped out by global warming to the point that agricultural is no longer viable. Thankfully, I'll be long dead before all of that misery is unleashed on the world... Or will I?"
