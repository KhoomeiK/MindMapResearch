It's what we deem as important... I'd say it's a matter of perspective. Humans do live for their own biological needs and yet they still want more because they had their needs satisfied (food, communication, etc.) hence this search for life's meaning. If however they didn't have all their needs satisfied like sex for example, they'll crave for it and start asking themselves again what's the meaning of life because they want more, something bigger. Like I do... I knew a man who didn't have much health and food 30-40 years a go, he had a hard life, he told me the meaning of life is to be healthy and have food. This is because he didn't have much of it. So you're kinda right. We need to satisfy our biological needs. If not we'll start asking too many questions and get nothing. Life's meaning is the satisfaction of our human parts and giving them what they want. The human brain for example, it's different in all of us, depending on how we perceive the world and depending on how our brain processes information, we will crave for meaning or we won't. In the end nothing matters. We're controlled by ourselves and this world is controlled by us."

But I'd say that Ni has vision, just knows things, predicts things, sees patterns and is usually right, and Te listens from external sources, like how to do something, (if it works for them it works for me), then Ni just expects what will happen in the external world by taking obvious information from the world, so that Te could find the best and fast way to do things, without wasting time, it's very important to not waste time. And that's it. If you didn't understand, it's like this: Ni foresees what will happen and is usually right, taking external info with Se and giving it meaning and sense with Ni therefore the prediction, and Te uses the info gathered from Se reality and organized with Ni, making some actions with perfection and again without wasting time uselessly, it's very important to not waste time, making up the fastest and correct way to do things or just get things done, following systems, the result is the most important for Te. Another thing is that Ti users probably think for themselves, while Te users think for the others, like me for example, worrying about the external world because of Te and Se. So... Ni= Insight, gather external info with Se and give it meaning and importance with Ni hence the prediction and certainty that NTJs have that others consider arrogance, history repeats itself and some things don't change. Te= Following systems and external logic and then start making some decisions, plans and actions. (If the others say or have evidence that it works, than I'll try it too, and if I find another way to do it, it's better)."
