Despite her casting me aside for 25 years, we were extremely tight friends. Like we went away on vacation and would share a bed we were so tight and she knew I'd keep my hands to myself.

I met a wonderful woman whom I fell deeply in love with. I'm shopping for rings for her now.

sex,f5wr2yg,t3_dpk24y,1572529140.0,"Like two and a half years ago I reconnected with this girl I always had a crush on in high school. We were both oddballs and kind of quiet, but boy did she age gracefully.  


So after a few dates and me wining and dining her and just some making out, I asked her if I could treat us to a fancy hotel room in town and she was all over me right away super excited for it. So flash forward a week, I get to the hotel right from work before her and it's RIDICULOUSLY nice. Like I had no fucking idea it was going to be this nice. I looked so out of place because I was in work clothes and there were people in like suits and evening gowns walking around.   


So she arrives a few hours later and has the same reaction at how nice it was, because there was like a fancy old school lounge with a jazz band downstairs and bellhops and stuff. So I asked her what she wanted to do and she was like I want to go out clubbing then come back and fuck you, deadpan to my face. Now I hate dancing but I was like, meh, if I just get liquored up a bit I can deal with it if it'll show her a nice night.  


So we go out and it's pouring rain, and we start hitting up different bars and clubs. She's a pretty mousy girl personality wise but she started really opening up. Problem was, she started getting visibly TOO drunk. She threw up on the floor and the bouncer started yelling at me to get her out of there, and somehow as I was trying to assure the bouncer we were leaving I look over and she's doing a shot. So at this point I'm like FUCK.  


So we leave and it's now raining like a bastard and like 11 at night. She decides to sit down on the sidewalk and is just like ""leave me here."" I'm like no the fuck I can't just leave you here we need to get you dry and warm. She starts slapping me and I'm like YO we have to get inside, it's January and we're soaked and still have like a mile left to walk.  


So about a hundred yards from the hotel she straight up blacks out. I'm like oh no, oh please no. I tried waking her but she wouldn't wake up. So I had to put her over my shoulder and soaking wet walk through the lobby where like there was this huge rich people party going on. It looked like a fucking roofied her and I was like oh no this isn't good they're so going to call the cops.   


So I got her upstairs and got her out of her wet clothes - didn't do anything creepy, I'm a decent guy; her finger tips and lips were blue so I just wanted to get her dry and to bed. We were sitting on the sidewalk for over an hour while I tried to convince her she couldn't sleep out in the rain on the ground. So I go to bed pretty upset and pissed off, and fall asleep. Not because I didn't get laid, because I put in so much effort to give her a wonderful night and she totally wiped has ass with it. A few hours later I wake up because I hear her puking in the bathroom. I know oh the door and am like hey, are you okay? She comes out buck ass naked and just starts packing her backpack. I'm like the fuck are you doing, and she's like I need to go home. I'm immediately like oh fuck no you're still drunk as sin, you can't drive home.   


So this got her really mad.  What this girl does for a living is she works with a contracting company that flips homes. So she's alone in derelict houses all the time and she's a very attractive petite little thing, so she got her LTC because she's often in there with big dudes by herself. So I told her again I physically was NOT letting her leave the room to drive home that drunk. So still stark naked she pulled a fucking gun on me and was like ""no I'm going home."" And I was like okaaaaaay.... I guess you are.   


So she sloppily got dressed and left and we never spoke again. And that's the story of how I spent tons of money on a fancy night out so we could have sexy times, the girl got too drunk and made me look like a rapist, then pulled a gun on me while naked.   


This was not the sexiest thing that ever happened to me."

I'm a former paramedic, I did it for years. Now I am by no means saying what your husband did is okay, or justifiable. It's fucked up and dangerous and inconsiderate of his family, and he absolutely needs to talk to someone. However, as someone that worked in EMS, if you want a possible explanation (NOT an excuse, like I said what he did is NOT okay), he could have had something truly fucked happen at work.   


One of the first things they teach about in EMT school, and then again in Medic school, before they even get to the medical aspect and A&P, is taking care of yourself. The first few days are on what's called burn out. And not burn out like ""I had a rough day at work, I'm burnt out,"" burn out as the actual medical condition where your nervous system actually sustains observable physical damage from constantly being exposed to high levels of stress. I actually left EMS after a decade of being on a dedicated 911 truck because it was so bad - my behavior was changing, I was way more irritable, all I wanted to do was sleep, I began hating everyone because of the bullshit you put up with dealing with the public, which was never me, I was always a very kind, compassionate person. But the burnout over time crept up on me and got the better of me.  


Now the thing is, I got help. There's a good chance there could be an understandable reason for your husband's behavior. Not that it makes it okay, but he could be in a position where he really needs to take a step back for mental health reasons and take some time to take care of himself. I'm not saying he has to quit EMS like I did, but at the very least, if something *did* happen, he's a grown ass man with a family and he has to realize he chose a career in which if you don't responsibly handle your own mental health, you could end up being an absolute mess."

At no point while I was like swiping a candy bar from 7/11, did I think in one hour's time from when I left the store I'd be getting chased like it was Rambo First Blood, then after hours of being apprehended by hundreds of cops and being followed by helicopters I'm holed up in a suburban living room, covered in blood and just screaming REMEMBER MY NAME as the whole back of the house blows out and an armored truck smashes through the front of the house."
