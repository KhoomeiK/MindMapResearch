Antipsychiatry,fktwh6h,t3_fkkmvq,1584536559.0,"Imagine you lived in a world where you could go out and smoke some MJ. I don't know, man, data on the effects of marijuana is just part of suspressed knowledge (that was either never collected or straight suspressed) that would potentially put psychiatric methods up to question. At this point we can't tell anything for sure, but you definitely can go and test it on yourself. I'm a regular illegal-drug user (its mostly THC; also I'm from Poland so it is illegal) and the time when I smoked a fuck ton of weed, was, coincidentally, when I was into fasting or keto diet (of which fasting promotes hormone regulating if I understood properly, and keto is therapeutic in general). It usually gave me a clear head, and, despite smoking a lot - extreme high energy levels. So what I recommend, is you take care of your bodily needs, so that there's nothing in the way of just sitting down with the THC. And I do mention this, because it's easy to fall kinda unconscious under the influence of drugs, in general. Becoming conscious in the area of the way we eat brings us closer to the source and you might even become able to connect psychiatry with diet. Low fat propaganda, etc. Your illness might be an effect of your diet. And before you say its bullshit, explain to me how. Before you disregard it, explain to yourself why. It might, and you won't know, unless you try. There's a lot we do not know about this planet \[in a sense of how we resonate with specific drugs; and even about our own system of a body\] and in the end the only way to know is to check yourself. Oh, and by the way - due to the recent panic - this might firstly give you a new perspective on the pandemic but also maybe peek your interest in the area of nutrition.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qct0mJN\_hc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qct0mJN_hc)  Man, in these times you won't know unless you check for yourself. They don't need you to know. There isn't only suspressed knowledge about stuff that doesn't work or is harmful, but also about stuff that works, and it does so to an extent, where pharmaceutical companies would basically go bankrupt or worse getting sued etc. So since you're on this sub, you have an open head. But there's always more, you've gotta keep it open. See, if what I said makes sense - and take action yourself :) 

This isn't our game. They don't need you to know. It's not about us. It's about them."

But all the conclusions I ever had ... you don't really need to understand, for it to have an effect on you. You don't even need to remember. The human psyche is so (I believe) hard to understand (all at once being simple AF) yet I try to make the best out of what I have and since im into dieting->philosophy->sociology->psychology (while I am not studying non of those, thats due to how (i believe) you mostly need to 1) know ur needs 2) observe \[and an Idea I had once was once you learn more about others u learn more about urself\] 3) think critically 4) become and empiricist (what we definie by knowledge might need to be redefined - just an Idea, but one I stick to) .

The visuals I had before made the shades look shadier, black look blacker, close look closer and far look further.

It's interesting to me because I read so much about LSD 

and when I tried it and I had (say) no expectations (because im trying to be an objective person) I never really had visuals. I believe I only had a death when I looked around and saw the world look like cardboard and when I thought about my life and thought: ""thats it??"" 

Never really got to talk about it too much hence I'm so open. I had a few intense trips 2 months ago and ever since I dont feel like the same person anymore. People do not recognize me. Sometimes it's scary... When you, say, don't have an ego, being sociable isn't so simple. Especially if you've been a sociopath/psychopath before.."
