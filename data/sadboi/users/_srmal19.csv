EDAnonymous,fq64pvi,t1_fq54g0f,1589124450.0,I completely understand. Have you recommended he research eating disorders?? I asked my boyfriend to do the same (he hasn‚Äôt) but if he does maybe then he‚Äôll understand the kind of effect those comments would have on you in the future. I really really hope you start feeling better about yourself soon though!! I have been doing the Chloe ting 2 week shred on YouTube (free!!!) and even just doing two videos for 25 minutes really really helps me feel better day to day and not as guilty when I eat because she‚Äôll kick your ass!! Wishing you the best üíú

AmItheAsshole,fjet9st,t3_fcvod8,1583277815.0,"As much as I think you should bring this issue to the light of day, I think your sibling is clearly showing signs of disordered eating (binge eating disorder is just as dangerous as any eating disorder) and you should tread lightly... Eating and secret and hiding evidence of eating is tangled up with a lot of shame and self esteem issues and having your sibling ""exposed"" will do so much more harm than good"
AmItheAsshole,fivud8z,t3_fa0apv,1582768264.0,"NTA. Absolutely fucking not. As someone who also struggles with disordered eating and the purging habit that came along with it, I am absolutely horrified at this experience. I am so sorry someone treated you like this. I think it is absolutely necessary that you left those reviews. I know someone like myself would definitely take your comments into consideration and take my business somewhere with empathetic and kind employees. Anyone giving you a hard time about what you chose to do is a moron, small business or not. If they‚Äôre hoping to grow their client base and stay open they need to provide those clients with a positive experience. Which they clearly did not do."

AskAnAmerican,fbtmxy4,t3_eegmo5,1577085424.0,"I think it‚Äôs a little silly. Although I do hope that it deters minors from forming this shit habit to begin with. However, I started smoking when I was 15, It definitely wasn‚Äôt very accessible to me then but I still got cigarettes and vape products. If they really want to get the stuff they‚Äôre gonna find a way to get it. So the whole ‚Äúvaping epidemic‚Äù seems like a charade meant to just distract us from real issues happening in the country."
