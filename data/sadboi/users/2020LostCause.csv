SuicideWatch,fnmxlu6,t1_fnktzek,1587080146.0,"Yeah. Is that considered gaslighting? Anyway, he both encouraged me to reach out to him and then told me he was busy and to call 9-1-1.

help me but am unable to actually make the appointment because the trauma floods my mind and I cannot deal. Its still a major relief to know that SOMEONE has my back and I think that’s what most of us want. The longer we feel we’re left alone to deal with it the more hopeless we feel and it just adds fuel to the suicidal thoughts... 

I am torn about this because I know that the therapist will do this again and again... He did not feel he had done anything wrong. The best I can hope for is that he refuses anyone with any significant issues and takes on only the ones who want to “chat”.

I don’t know how old you are... if you are over 18 (or 21, not sure of regulations where you are), then you should be able to see one without them knowing and it may help. If you are younger, that is a much trickier situation... I’d try to speak to someone at school to see if there are any resources for you but then again, things are very messed up around the world so I’m not sure what services at your school are still being offered... definitely this pandemic has made things way worse for anyone with pre-existing problems.

I myself am having daily meltdowns and barely making it from one day to the next so I’m here on reddit a lot and in some moments of sanity and relief in my waking hours  (ie now) I try my best to be positive and help others like you (much like you helped me) while I am not in  breakdown mode... So I feel for you. It is incredibly difficult to live through. I’m thinking of you and all others who are stuck and feel completely hopeless in addition to having to deal with the chaos of the pandemic. 

If there is one good thing though its that I think a LOT of people are experiencing symptoms and that many of us have been dealing with for years and health organizations/hospitals are now more aware of the need for resources for mental health. 

Woulda been nice if it didn’t take half the population being depressed and on the edge before they realized competent mental health resources were necessary.

A lot of younger kids are going to have this problem too and I hope they find a way for them to get help even when their families are uncooperative or dismissive of their struggles.

Thinking of all of you. Sending you all ❤️. Before my next breakdown haha. Seriously though... I hope you get the help you need. There is nothing worse than feeling alone and unsupported."

My psychiatrist is reliably available, empathetic and caring, understands my feelings and repeats that he wants to help and is there for me whenever I need and am ready to trust again. 

I don’t know what the difference is but I would never go near another psychologist for as long or short (hopefully) as I live. I feel manipulated and used for a weekly spot in his schedule and a sizeable fee, and no support."

SuicideWatch,fngmo4k,t1_fng3ghb,1586937288.0,"I was also seeing a psychiatrist only for meds but he also offered therapy and is far more down to earth and caring than this arrogant SOB of a therapist. The psychiatrist had to intervene and I had to see him about twice a week for 3 weeks to calm down from that traumatizing crisis. We then went to once a week but this happened at around the anouncement of the global pandemic so like everyone else I guess we started doing virtual sessions by skype, zoom, facetime etc. The week later, I had a major anxiety attack and cancelled the appointment, afraid this would happen again. We’ve discussed it since (email) and he was very understanding and politely agreed that the therapist had f*cked me up and set me back and that he would be there for me anytime I needed to see him and do everything he could to help me. He was super reassuring and I calmed back down enough to agree to get back to weekly sessions but I am still terrified to say anything at all. He’s always been reliable and I trust him, he literally saved my life (I was hours away from OD’ing) but I’m still too traumatized. 

I’m procrastinating making an appointment because my daily anxiety has gotten worse and I’ve never been a germophobe but suddenly am getting OCD and can’t function in or outside of the house nor go to a store to get meds nor buy food (started this week) now. Clearly I need help but this latest ocd has been crippling and I can’t get out of bed most days now... I’m alone, younger, so I cannot see my parents who are totally isolating, ordering online, having food delivered and doing all fine and good, oblivious to my issues (because I never told them). I know I need to get back to see the psychiatrist, I’m giving myself a few days of space then will call to set up the appointments. 

But yeah I am a complete mess as things get worse here and more and more signs/posters about Covid-19 get put up all over the city and more and more restrictions and threats by police about leaving the house are announced.

This man has a phd as a clinical psychologist and terminated me for the very reason I was there to see him because he was afraid of what would happen if I did kill myself. He actually said this to me4. I guess he will find out now...

The second opinion said it was a massive breach of trust and has set me back. I no longer trust any professionals. I’ve documented all of it and sent it to both the therapist, my psychiatrist, have it written in a notebook, and told a few people about it.

I can’t cope, can’t even leave the house, the city looks like a ghost town although we are several million, and I have no where outside the house go go and sit and calm myself down when I need to. Zero restaurants or coffee shops are open. 

I’ve self-medicated, I’ve mixed drugs and alcohol, I cancelled my appointment with my psychiatrist who was happy to have one less person to see that day/week, and I’m sending my accountant all my papers before I take the leap (so to speak).

TwoXChromosomes,fjjylk9,t1_fjicsc1,1583415841.0,"See my recent above post on this. I completely agree. I am so so sorry that Americans have to go through this. It HAS got to affect their stress level and health just imagining the possibilities, especially for lower or even medium income families WITH KIDS. 

I am not American (I’m Canadian) but it is infurriating to read about, especiallly after my husband was diagnosed with cancer and died 10 months later, probably hundreds of thousands of dollars of treatments later if we were in the US but we/I am Canadian so medicare covered every single cost including sending nurses to our home TWICE daily at the end. 

Please do something USA!"

TwoXChromosomes,fjjxstl,t3_fdgoc6,1583415239.0,"I’m sorry to say this but come to Canada. 

My husband was diagnosed with cancer and died 10 months later but not without going through weekly doctor visits, numerous procedures, one major surgery, 3-4 Emergency room visits A WEEK, a few week-long stays in the hospital, and of course the ever expensive chemotherapy with home visits daily near the end... ALL covered by medicare. 

What little “extra” I and every other Canadian pays extra in taxes (remember cost of living can and is mostly lower here too in many cities) would not even begin to cover the expenses needed to cover the medical costs in the US. He would have had to abandon all treatment as soon as money/insurance ran out and suffer until his death for who knows how long. 

I know many people who went through the same, maybe spent more years getting treatment and SURVIVED and is living a normal life today, fully employed, contributing to the economy and participating in consumerism like everyone else due to Canadian Medicare. 

OP, I’m so sorry you are in this situation. I wish the US would do more to protect the health of the very people keeping the country alive and the economy going at the very least, if the agenda is political/financial, and just the simply and obviously the right and ethical and human thing to do. How can that not make sense?"
modnews,fjjvwxz,t3_fdh4rr,1583413742.0,"First, those who are in favor of this service/partnership either used CTL with sucess, or are not depressed/suicidal with no other outlet than here (even if they have a therapist).

Those who vent here do so because they know they can express their true feelings as uncomfortable as they may be to others who do not or have never felt that way, and in sending in the Crisis Text Line, most will worry that a cop will eventually show up at their door (I’ve experienced this twice but not because of CTL) and instead have no where to vent. 

Imagine the consequences of that. I used the suicide watch sub here to vent numerous times when I otherwise would have taken more drastic and dangerous mesures to cope. Its the same reason therapy is a joke because you can’t express or talk about your real feelings without the professional’s obligation to act, so most people refrain and have no outlet. The pressure builds up and ... nothing good can happen. 

I can say a LOT if not MOST Redditors who posted despairing thoughts that would have triggered the CTL or sent cops to their location have ended up surviving their distressing episode for the sole reason that they could express it, talk about it, vent about it freely and openly and THAT is what helps most severely depressed and suicidal people and is the same reason THERAPY does NOT.

Most redditors are by now aware of this independant service that they can text and I’d venture to say that many have already tried it without success. Meaning that this place was more helpful in keeping them safe and alive than CTL was. Those who have success with CTL can continue to use it but by imposing it here you are removing THIS coping option that has worked when CTL has not.

Now Reddit no longer has a safe place for them/me to express their real feelings. Good job. 

The worst is that less people will come here to expresss their despairing thoughts and Reddit and other suicide prevention teams will assume it’s because the partnership is working, and is a good thing, when actually, people have stopped posting, and used other probably more unhealthy (at best) or lethal (at worst) means to cope with their moment of despair and impulsiveness.

Please re-consider this move."
modnews,fjjuk4k,t1_fjiwegf,1583412605.0,"Yep most already know about hotlines. If we thought they would help better, we’d use them. I have and the do nothing for me. Reddit has provided me with more relief from distress than CTL has ever."

askapsychologist,ff77qk9,t3_e6dg5r,1579642772.0,"This isn’t an answer and I’m not a psychologist so am I allowed to comment?

I’m around your age, also widowed but no kids and spend all my time in bed when I’m home. I don’t watch tv but I eat in bed, sleep in bed, watch netflix in bed, think of ways to knock myself out for 2 days in bed... basically every waking moment in my appartment is spent in bed. When the going gets bad and I am near giving in to impulsiveness I have to leave the house. Otherwise I try to knock myself out in bed for as many hours as possible.

Not an answer, will probably get deleted but wanted you to know you’re not alone. Probably not much (if any) consolation. Sorry..."
