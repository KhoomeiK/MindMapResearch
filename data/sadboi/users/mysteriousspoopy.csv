We had a project about why was freedom of speech necessary in the US and to use evidence as to why. Three guys and one girl as a group decided to make a poor presentation that contained lot of explict words (fuck, nigga, ass, etc.) and had stretched out pictures of memes that had no meaning to the topic.

Each slide barely made any sense of why freedom of speech was necessary, and the only example they used is a cheeseburger. If you ask me, I had no clue because I was busy feeling pathetic for them. 

The teacher wasn't happy about it but they at least got a D for the effort."

AskReddit,fmc4pnn,t3_fu5ac0,1585938861.0,"I was homeless, but living in a crappy hotel was the closest thing to being on the streets. We've been in the shelter twice and we were allowed stay there for a month two times per year. It was difficult at the time because my mom is very difficult to deal with when it comes to the field of work (lazy and selfish), and the only way to pay for the room each week was child support money and the money that my mom gets when she sleeps with men. The CPS would've taken us if they actually knew what was going on instead of my mom acting like it was fine. It was me, my brother, and my mother in one tiny hotel room and it felt like pure hell. We were still there a few days into the pandemic. 

One night I decided to walk out to a nearby gas station to get some food with the food stamps card that my mom lended me before she left somewhere. Keep in mind that the area I lived in was not good at all. While out there I did see some prostitutes standing around and I assumed there would be visible drugs around the area so I was really scared walking through there. After awkwardly walking by them, there was this alleyway between two buildings where this middle-aged man was standing in, that I passed by. After a few steps, I started hearing footsteps behind me. My heart started pounding when I heard someone walking behind me, so I tried speed walking. The footsteps went faster behind me. I got so fucking scared I started running as fast as I can all the way to the gas station. A manly voice shouted behind me but I didn't know he was saying because I was about to breakdown into tears. I turned back around after I arrived to my destination and it was that same man in the alleyway. 

When I finally reached to the gas station, after I got the food and essentials, I asked for a phone so I could have a police officer take me ""home."" I explained the officer about everything including the man, and she told me she felt sorry for the housing situation and that she will investigate about the man. She took me home and since my mom wasn't there, she called my family friend about what happened and my family friend came over for comfort. She was super outraged the fact that my mom should've stayed home incase something would happen to either me or the brother, but in my opinion it was my fault for having to go out there without adult permission in the first place. Before the officer left she gave me and my brother $50 each for us to use on food and stuff we needed, and I never forgot that day ever since. 

Today my brother and I now live with our aunt since we finally got evicted from the hotel, and my mom is living with my family friend until she gets her act together and be serious about a job and a place to live until Metro (low-income house relief) kicks in. My aunt refuses for my mom to live in her house because of family issues and how she treated us. I feel much better in the environment that I'm living in and I can finally use some stress relief by working on school work and sleep. 

TL;DR -- Lived in a crappy hotel, went out at night to get food at a gas station to have a man following me and had to call the police to take me home after I arrived at the gas station from being followed. I now live in a better home with my aunt."

I felt like they did start to pick up since Ultra Beatdown.
They are gaining a lot more fans now because of their new album that reflects on vaporwave-style and video games which is really cool, and I rarely see anyone hating them anymore."
