troubledteens,fns2f66,t1_fnrpdl9,1587210461.0,"I am autistic. I am diagnosed with anxiety, depression, autism, ADHD, OCD, unspecified mood disorder, eating disorder (OSFED) and severe emetophobia, I have attempted suicide multiple times this week because of my inability to cope with this time. I am not functioning. I am receiving the highest level of care I can at home. Currently have therapy 3x a week. Shit ton of meds. At home therapy work every day. I‚Äôm struggling off the charts with school. At school I have a 1:1 that has to stay with me all day due to my safety issues, meltdowns, running away, hiding, inability to communicate at times, etc. I‚Äôm struggling so much to the point where nobody knows what to do. Don‚Äôt bash my story please. My trauma in residential is very valid. Just because I have hope that there are better places doesn‚Äôt make me a bad person. Every single one of the places we‚Äôve considered right now (which is fully my choice and decision. I‚Äôve been doing all the research. Not my parents) are in California. They are all inside an unlocked house. Huge houses. I had an amazing experience at the only residential I went to in a house, Center For Discovery. It literally helped me so much and the staff were amazing, and the girls were like family to me. The programs we are looking into are fucking expensive. Because they put a lot into it. Private chef that would cook all my meals in a kitchen. An actual bedroom, and living room, etc. not just a tiny place or a shitty institution like seven starts where you have carpeted walls and 3 roommates and share 2 disgusting bathrooms that are in the hallway. It‚Äôs a lot different. But still, because of my trauma, I‚Äôve talked to former clients who have been to these programs. I‚Äôve heard nothing but good things so far, which is incredibly encouraging. I expressed my concerns to the girls and guys I talked to and they all assured me that based off their experiences, I would not be hurt by these places. My life right now is not sustainable. I am fully willing to die. I feel that I will never function in this world and that I‚Äôll never get better. And most of all, I genuinely won‚Äôt make it through the next couple months at this rate. Not too long ago I was in the ICU on breaching machines after a suicide attempt. I need a higher level of support or I‚Äôm going to end up killing myself due to my lack of ability to cope."

Their hearts are broken that I was hurt so much in treatment. They are not forcing me to go back. I know I need more help, and I‚Äôm 16 and capable of deciding what I‚Äôm willing to do to get in a better spot. I‚Äôm professionally diagnosed with autism, ADHD, depression, anxiety, emetophobia, dermatillomania, misophonia, OCD, OSFED, an unspecified mood disorder, and SPD. I‚Äôve got a lot on my plate. I rely on a high amount of benzos (prescribed) just to get me through a day. Going away from home isn‚Äôt ideal. And honestly I‚Äôm terrified. Terrified I‚Äôll find a place that I think isn‚Äôt abusive but it will just happen all over again and I will be left feeling more broken then when I arrived. But I know I can‚Äôt continue to live at home during the pandemic either. So I‚Äôm doing my best to research the hell out of places and talk to people who have actually been there to avoid another shitty facility. But I‚Äôm still scared, rightfully. Going to places that said they would help but ended in me having objects throw at me, getting death threats, my clothes thrown in the toilet, family pictures ripped up, told I should kill myself, that I‚Äôm fat, that I should starve myself more, being put in restraints by male staff purposely because they know I have trauma with males, having nursery music played while I had a meltdown and when I was crying and asked them to turn it off I was told ‚Äúnot until you stop acting like a baby‚Äù.

You can have off site passes with your family, sometimes even overnight. You can go on fun outings with the group like out to get ice cream or to visit museums. The other nice thing about residentials is that they are more homelike. A lot of the residentials I‚Äôve been to were in actual homes where there was living rooms, kitchen, bedrooms, backyards, etc. honestly being in a home environment made the treatment easier.

In all honesty I would recommend steering clear from amazon and target weighted blankets. They are made in bad factories in China and are low quality and will not last nearly as long. I once spent an entire day looking at weighted blankets on amazon and what I found is when you look at the negative reviews there is always a re occurring problem whether that be weight displacement, tears, etc. yes there will be some good reviews in there but at least for me I‚Äôm not willing to take that gamble.

emetophobia,f6yycx4,t3_dtna5b,1573303755.0,"I always stay at a friends house when this happens. If you can‚Äôt, do you have a basement you could stay in? I recommend distracting yourself with a movie (probably in headphones so it blocks out more noise) and reminding yourself you are safe and this will pass. Worrying about if you‚Äôre going to catch it or not will not influence if it actually happens. Take some elderberry supplement to boost your immune system, wipe things down with Clorox, wash your hands frequently and carry hand sanitizer with you, and honestly I take melatonin to help me sleep because If I‚Äôm not awake I‚Äôm not dealing with it!"
emetophobia,f6u3jdb,t3_dt0tbx,1573157640.0,This happened to me LAST WEEK. I had a 4 hour panic attack after she feel asleep üôÉ I love kids with all my heart but I just can‚Äôt when that happens
mentalhealth,f6r3tbp,t3_dsl0vt,1573093002.0,"AMEN. It‚Äôs horrible and every time it happens in real life I‚Äôm not afraid to call people out. As someone with autism, using that word is NOT okay"

emetophobia,f6kry76,t3_drrz0m,1572919238.0,"Hi! I got mine done under general anesthesia so I‚Äôm not much help. I had major panic attacks before hand reading stories and watching videos about it. My greatest advice is STOP looking at those things. The thing is, people rarely go to social media for their good experiences. They only go for the bad ones. What your seeing is horror stories that hardly ever happen compare to how many people do well with an IUD. Call your doctor beforehand because they will prescribe you Ativan or another prn to help calm you down! Take pain meds before you go. Drink lots of water. Bring some distractions. Wear a pad afterwards (there can be some bleeding) and wear comfy clothes. You are going to be fine!! I experienced a lot of pain after the insertion but it definitely was a lot worse then what‚Äôs normal. I ended up on 3 different opioids for the pain and I‚Äôve currently been on my period for 47 days but again my situation had other factors. You will be okay I promise!!! It‚Äôs not going to be fun but it‚Äôs very quick from what I‚Äôve heard (because I was asleep for it so Idk lol)"

emetophobia,f5so65b,t3_dp36ix,1572438361.0,The same exact thing happened to me last night! I have IBS so I was trying to tell myself it was probably that.

mentalhealth,f5d6a0c,t3_dnlkyt,1572149137.0,"This makes me feel so much less alone üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôve never met anyone else or talked to anyone else with HS. People don‚Äôt understand how debilitating it is. There are days when I get cysts and skin lesions so painful that I literally can‚Äôt walk. I got bullied all my life for having big cysts constantly in my armpits. I feel like no one will ever find me sexy or attractive with huge scars, especially in my genital/thigh area. I tell myself people will probably think I have an STD. I don‚Äôt feel attractive. I once watched a video of a doctor talking about HS and one of the more affirming things I ever heard was ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt wish this disease on my worst enemy‚Äù. It‚Äôs not *just* a skin condition. It had ruined years of my life and I‚Äôm so sorry it‚Äôs done the same to you. The only thing keeping me semi stable right now is being on the auto immune paleo diet. Sounds crazy but it‚Äôs done wonders. I went aip for a few weeks after reading people saying it helped their HS. Maybe 3ish weeks later I tried introducing dairy and sugar again. And I kid you not almost IMMEDIATELY I got one of the WORST flares I‚Äôve ever gotten which ended in several urgent care visits, literally screaming in pain because I couldn‚Äôt put my arm down. I feel like people don‚Äôt understand how severe it is. It has destroyed so many parts of my life. It hurts my heart to hear you talk about your struggles because I so deeply connect with them. I know it‚Äôs hard and kind of hypocritical for me to say, but please hold on. Keep fighting. Because I just HAVE to believe we will find a cure. I have to believe we will find new treatments for it. I have to believe that HS can‚Äôt steal everything from me. I‚Äôm sorry we are like this. But you aren‚Äôt alone. We will keep fighting day by day. One day, it has to be better. It will."

illnessfakers,f58ajdn,t1_f580lcz,1572052253.0,Oh I agree on the fluids part. I just feel like it‚Äôs kind of a touchy subject to talk about how unflattering/gross/ugly/etc someone is. But in terms of fluids I completely agree she doesn‚Äôt need them and it‚Äôs clearly hurting her body.

emetophobia,f580ct4,t3_dn4wsz,1572046406.0,"You definitely didn‚Äôt catch anything.

Not to mention babies are MUCH more prone to catching bugs then you are so even if it was something like that you would most likely definitely not get it. And there is no way you could really catch it anyways. Breathe, you‚Äôre going to be fine!!"
autism,f5803z8,t3_dn4xl9,1572046278.0,They are pretty expensive everywhere. Sometimes I‚Äôve found a good alternative is a yoga ball. You would need someone else willing to help but I have my mom and OT roll the yoga ball over me for good deep pressure. Sometimes I‚Äôm able to roll on the yoga ball on my stomach to get deep pressure as well. We had a roller at the autism treatment center I went to and honestly yoga balls give better deep pressure then the roller in my opinion!
illnessfakers,f57i2fb,t3_dmzafg,1572036442.0,It doesn‚Äôt matter. This reddit isn‚Äôt about whether her pics are flattering or not. It‚Äôs about calling her out on her BS.

emetophobia,f4yk4bt,t3_dm7qzi,1571878339.0,This summer I worked with preschoolers at VBS. One of the girls had a horrible stomach ache one day which scared me so freaking bad.

emetophobia,f4w409q,t1_f4w38gs,1571851531.0,Do you think you could get a babysitter on Care.com app? They have to put in their application whether they are able to look after sick children or not. I know some people use it if they have to go to work but their kids are sick. But maybe this could just be an opportunity for you to get out of the house and regulate for a bit.

I‚Äôm sure if you contact a crisis line they will help you find something that you don‚Äôt have to pay for. If you ever need to talk to someone, I suggest texting HOME to 741741.
