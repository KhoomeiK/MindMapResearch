AskReddit,fh81ftm,t3_f1fdyo,1581349882.0,"I don't know it if it lucid dreaming, so please correct me if I am wrong. 

I am aware most nights that I am dreaming and it is something that I have experienced ever since I was a kid and it won't stop!

It always turns into a nightmare, I feel like I am trapped there, I'm lost and I can't get out. It is like I can feel everything. I haven't experienced it in a few days, last night was the first time and it was horrible... my great grandmother was there who recently passed away. It was like I was losing control of the narrative and it was turning horrible... and I was stuck there. But I know it is a dream and I can tell myself to get out of there/wake up, but I can't get out. 

I don't know if this has anything to do with lucid dreams? But I can feel things, not just emotions, but objects. 

I used to keep a journal of what happened in each dream, but I don't do it anymore."

BPD,fh2hpjj,t3_ev5upy,1581253149.0,"Honestly, this is so well put I love it! Better than how I could have explained it.   
And that is coming from someone who had BPD, although a doctor first told me I had bipolar, but now I have BPD. And I've just started studying Psychology, we look at the DSM a lot (in my modules anyway). 

I just feel like sometimes people just don't get it, and don't realise how invasive the disorder is - just like what you said, reading the DSM doesn't show it.. if you know what I mean.

I do like that ***some*** people really do try to understand and get what it all means for me (in terms of some of my family and friends, and some close class mates) but ehhhh. I don't even know how to properly explain it myself."
AskReddit,fh28mya,t3_f0ri76,1581240506.0,"Depends on which one... 

I only know because a few of them ended up going to my college and a few to my university. 

* One of them turned heavily to drugs, along with her friend who also has a kid now. 
* One of them went to university, no idea what for, but I am not surprised despite how nasty he was he was incredibly smart. 
* Another lives off his mum and dad, always has done. And the only reason I know that is because his girlfriend used to tell me all the time because she hoped he would change and get a job / not force her to spend her money. 
* One of them is my cousins girlfriend now, but no idea what else she is ""doing""

And who knows about the rest of them, I don't check up on them, I'm too busy with my own degree. But some of them say hi when they see me, a few of them apologised for it after I attempted suicide and the headteacher told them I self-harmed."
AskReddit,fgx8rk0,t3_f0pegt,1581170288.0,"Urghh I don't even know... 

&#x200B;

* I overdosed when I was 13(ish) because I just wanted to die. I was sick in the bathroom and I felt like I couldn't breathe. My guardian at the time knew, she told me it was all in my head, that there was no point calling anyone and I should just stay in my room to be sick. 
* I was talking to a mental health professional at the police station after being sexually assaulted, we got into my family history, mental health history etc. We must have started talking about my parents and siblings. She told me that she took my mothers side in all of this, because if she was my mother she wouldn't let me near my sister either because I self-harm. 
* My dad picked me up from my aunties house, he said a lot of things to me during that drive. We never had a relationship and I think this day had been the first time in years. But he told me I was not even his daughter because of my mental health and because of my self-harm. He also told me that my mum never wanted me and never loved me, that my nan only wanted me because she got paid to have me. And because of the sexual assault no man would ever want me (or love me) and it was all my fault. I mean I'm not stupid, I knew my mum never wanted me anyway, but neither did my dad - don't know why he acted like he was any better than her. 
* I guess as well.. being told I don't even look depressed, so I can't be depressed because I don't ""look"" it. Which I have been told by so many doctors, because whenever I have to talk to someone after I overdosed I smile or I'm laughing... not like I find it funny, not because I am okay, because I struggle showing my true emotions in front of others. 
* Being told I need to get over myself, despite everything that has happened. Which has been said to me so many times when all I am doing is asking for help..
* Being told that if I really wanted to kill myself I would walk out in front of a bus right now. 
* I was taken to the hospital before I did anything, there was a plan to commit suicide. The people I spoke to there told me there was no point to be being there, to get over myself and sent me home after talking to me for 10 minutes?"
AskReddit,fgwu7rz,t3_f0hzfu,1581165840.0,"1. How they stare at you. 

I find staring so creepy. 
Making eye contact is cute, but full on staring and not blinking... no...

I went on a date with this guy.
It was my fault, I wasnt ready to get back on the dating scene. 
I took him back to my house because I was cooking us a three course meal. 
But there was something off, like really off, but I couldnt put my finger on it. 
He was cute before and we had so much in common, but this time something had changed. 

After dinner, we sat on the sofa, just watching tv. That's when I noticed he was constantly staring at me and not blinking. 
Nothing was said between us, because I'm so shy and really awkward... but he got on top of me. 
But he was still staring at me, it was just so weird and creepy. 

I think it took 14 hours to get him away from me?


2. No matter how many times I say ""no"" they still try to convince me. 

A few years after that guy ^^

I started talking to another guy, which is one hell of a story in itself. 

But anyway, this one CONSTANTLY asked for either sex or pictures and I just did not want to, but he would not stop. 

According to him he has a massive crush on me and everything is all my fault. It is my fault for not wanting sex and leading him on despite constantly saying no."
AskReddit,fgwq0nr,t3_f0oys1,1581164593.0,"My cousin came into my room after I had a shower, so all I had on was a towel (she wanted to play Anna and Elsa). She asked me why I had cuts (they were scars) all over my body, and why I didn't live with my dad.   
I had no idea what to say to her, but I guess lucky for me she didn't ask anything else. She got a spare towel and wrapped it around one of my legs, because it was a ""bandage""."
