I do the same thing when I record myself playing guitar, send emails, sing, send texts, etc.  I just don’t like looking at things I did in the past.  I have an INTP brain so dwelling on the past is something I can really spin myself out about for days or weeks at a time.  So for me it’s just generally unhealthy so I have an aversion.

It’s not so much a phobia, but more about letting the past stay in the past so I can move into the future.  Everybody is designed a little different, neuro-typical people are just boring, there’s several brain options out there, not all peculiar behavior is unhealthy.  Not everybody needs nor wants to rest on their laurels."

I developed bipolar mood disorder in my 15th ish year in the army after 3 combat tours.  I seriously feel like I woke up one day and my entire mood regulation mechanism in my brain was gone.  It didn’t feel gradual or anything like that.

My Doctors were baffled because it isn’t the kind of thing to show up in your 30s like that.  So more than likely I had it for a long time and just dumb Soldier dragged it through the mud and it finally beat me over after a long painful career.

It’s the most horrible disease, even when stable I will cry just thinking about how much of an uphill battle I have on an empty tank of gas.  I wouldn’t wish this disease on the worst of my enemies - it’s so turbulent, volatile, and misunderstood.  

People are like well, “what’s the big deal it’s a mood disorder”.  Yeah well you know what is affected by your mood? Every single ounce of your wellbeing, and to be constantly shifting is so incredibly painful.  Most of the time I honestly can’t even identify what my mood is because it numbs you to reality."
