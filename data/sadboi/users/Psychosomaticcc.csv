LeakyGutSyndrome,fnxvfu6,t3_g3q1tx,1587347185.0,"Carnivore diet may help. But most likely this is a psychosomatic issue and not dietary alone. Gut issues are massivly tied to anxiety - and anxiety causes constipation also.

Anxiety is a holding sensation. A tension. A fear of letting go of control. And the gut and anus will mirror this. You'll feel twisted up inside.

Fasting definately helps, but it's important that you don't always have to go to this extreme (I've fasted for a week before so I can relate). Balance is important.

Try yoga, and try some breathing exercises. There's a great free app called Prana that can teach you these. Breating deeply (whether it's through exercise, or just by doing breathing exercises) brings energy to areas of the body that don't normally recieve it due to anxiety locking up the inner system. Yoga involves breathing and opening up the body so that energies can flow. I guarentee you'll feel amazing after and poop like a champ. I like to run too, but that's just me. Anything that brings me into my body and involves deep breathing.

I was inflamed and deppressed for years because I kept eating foods that caused the problems, so I cut these out. That stopped 1 level of the problem - I now could exercise because my joints didn't hurt so much. Once I started to exercise, the depression lifted too. Sleep, diet, and exercise are the fundamental of feeling good my friend.

If you are having too many issues to exercise at present then do the breathig techniques - there's so many - look up stanislav grof, wim hof, or just yogic breathing. If you are out of shape and can't bring yourself to exercise at present then these tools are a huge first step.

Honestly don't underestimate the power of deep breathing. You can completely trip balls just from deep breathing alone with no substances. Prana is life force energy. Something is sucking up yours - no doubt you probably had some trauma's happen to you growing up, which has caused a lot of these issues subconsciously.

Find foods that don't upset you, exercise, get enough sleep (take a 40 min nap during the day too - they are awsome) and...

Cut out caffeine!!!! I don't know if you drink coffee but if you do then stop. Caffeine wreaks havoc on a system after a while and some people are very sensitive to it. If you love coffee - allow yourself 1 a week before exercise and no more. This will change your life - caffeine causes so much anxiety and dehydration and causes the body to be unable to absorb certain vitamins needed for general wellbeing. If someone drinks 2 or 3 a day - their system can get really out of whack!

See how you feel without dairy also. It turned out to be my biggest issue.

There is no wonder diet - everyone is different. So as a last resort look into an exclusion diet. This is where someone eats only 1 food for a few weeks, and then adds one more, and one more, and so on, slowly so that they can observe how each food type effects their system. This is difficult, but if you are in a bad way it's a good start.

Jordan Peterson and his daughter only eat meat and nothing else and they have cured themselves of many ailments, but most people don't have to go as drastic as that.

Best of luck"
Anxiety,fnxt9n9,t1_fnxkwhr,1587345867.0,Btw I am dairy and gluten intolerant. I have gut issues also. I have realised that they are a combination of fear and the effects of food. Both have to be addressed. Most issues have to be met on multiple dimensions of being. Thought being one of them - your attitude matters! So foster an attitude of trust with your gut. Even if all the evidence is to the contrary just know it'll get sorted. You don't have to know how. Just know. Trust. Faith is not a faith in something. Faith is trust in not knowing. Trust yourself. You are safe and you are loved. Tell your stomach that. Eat healthy. Relax. All is well. Your gut will respond well to this believe me 🤗
Anxiety,fnxruar,t1_fnxkwhr,1587345041.0,"Sorry no I'm not sure.

My advice would be to do as follows:

Lie down and be anxious and feel your health issues. Let your mind go mad. Squirm and toss and turn. Don't try yo fix it. It's going to happen no matter what you think or attempt to control.

Explore feelings and beliefs. Thinking in itself isn't wrong. Just believing them is where we go wrong. So you have to question your assumed beliefs. A lot of beliefs are totally assumed and unconsciously we have accepted them as true (mainly because everyone does). But NO thoughts are true. None. They are only helpful or unhelpful.

I'll give you some help:

I am dealing with anxiety.

Is that what the sensation is when you explore it? Or is it something deeper? Is anxiety a label we slap on uncomfortable sensations we don't truly understand? Because if we did understand, there wouldn't be a problem... the problem is we fear and label anxiety as BAD which means we have made an unconscious enemy. If we believe something is bad we fight it. We want it gone. We think about it. We create strategies to try to deal with it... and so on.

What if it wasn't anxiety? What if your fears were made of things you assumed to be true that aren't. The reason we don't feel safe to let go of thinking sometimes is because we are afraid that the inner enemies we have made will show up and devour us. So the task of thinking is to realise that we have made some wrong assumptions. The only problems are the ones we create - and that includes health issues.

These sensations are horrendously difficult to deal with (if you believe that) because our assumptions (unconscious beliefs) are strong as fuck. These beliefs have to be destroyed before we can let go of thinking with less fear.

Get your hands on some magic mushrooms if you can - there are plenty of places online to buy grow kits even though they are illegal. With Supagrow kits you literally just spray the bag the kit is inside once a day and in 3 weeks you'll habe plenty of mushrooms. I'm a student psychologist writing a paper on them at the moment. They are the future of health treatment as they are a wonder drug that fixes root causes of issues instead of treating symptoms.start with a low dose in a safe environment. Do your research at first. Listen to ""How to change your mind"" by Michael Pollan. Go to Maps.org and download their tripping guide regarding the steps to take when tripping to create a loving positve experience for yourself. Psychedelics are incredible healers but you can't go head first into them - you need to gently introduce yourself to them with small safe doses so that you can learn to swim in your unconscious mind. Understanding ""Set"" and ""Setting"" is a must. Remmeber though - they are healing you, and healig can hurt. They heal by destroying false beliefs. That hurts because we build our identity on false beliefs without realising that we do so. So when we destroy these beliefs, we destroy parts of our percieved self. What gets left over after trips is a healthier less deluded person, but it can take years to really deconstruct the deep beliefs that are causing the issues within us.

I had many false beliefs: For example: Most people believe that pain is bad. Pain is wonderful. Pain is simply strong sensation. It's not wrong to actually enjoy pain. To make friends with it. Remember the buddhists say ""Life is suffering"" which I could never get my head around because I had labelled suffering as BAD - enemy - not something I want. But that would mean life was bad. That I didn't want life. So I experiemented with myself and tried to sleep in uncomfortable positions where I was deeply aggrevating my back pain. I had a small anout of mushrooms in my system and I started to realise: I believe that it's not ok to feel good when suffering. Why? Because I believe suffering is bad. Why? I realised that I didn't really know why I had that belief. So I relaxed into pain. I made friends with it. I realised that like all things a balance needs to be found. Feeling pain means that you are alive. That's wonderful and if experienced from a certain perspective pain can feel beautiful and it can release locked up emotion inside us - this is why yoga is so amazing - moving into pain and weakness in the body and then lying down in bliss at the end. The balance is non judgement and non attachment. Pain - now I can take it or leave it - and that should be ones attitude to everything. Love = total acceptance of reality as it is (not as we would like it to be). Life involved highs and lows, love and loss, joy and grief. If we can't accept (love) the negative side and see that it actually isn't BAD then we will live in fear of the negative side of life and reside there.

You have to find a way to realise what your anxiety really is deep down. Drop the label. Anxiety has a source and it's that that needs addressing. Once the false beliefs are dead and gone then you'll be able to let go of thinking much much easier because you won't have any fears about doing so. Your health issues too. They won't be bad once your resistance to them is dropped. But understanding that resistance is a combination of thinking ourselves into a mess, breaking down in emotional exhaustion, giving up, and then recieving an intuitive answer. If one avoids this painful process of change then the issues can't be solved. So know it'll suck at times but that doesn't mean that you are on the wrong path. Sometimes the right path is painful as fuck.

Embrase your suffering. Give yourself to it. Submit to it. But do not assume you know what it is and what it means and what it will lead too - all that is not true. You can't know what it is if you fight it. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer is a saying for many reasons but 1 meaning is that we keep them close so that we can understand them. If you get them close enough you can merge with them and they no loger exist as enemies - only teachers thst we haven't been paying attention to because we had arrogent beliefs of ""I know"".

We don't know. I don't know shit. Awareness - consciousness - my deeper nature knows. It's when I think I know what's what is when I can't learn. Anxiety & Pain is trying to to get our attention to give us vital information, but if we assume we know what a sensation is, slap a label on it, and make it an enemy then unfortunately those anxieties and pains and health issues will grow, mainly because we weren't willing to be humbled into not knowing.

Alright mate that's my 2 cents. I don't know you or your life, but this stuff is universal so I hope it strikes a cord for you.

Love yourself. All of yourself. Accept your suffering deeply by staying with it until it breaks your mind. That's difficult. But like a rocket ship pushing through atmospheric pressure... when you burst through into space. The peace and weightlessness of a new beautiful perspective will be yours - all because you pushed into your fears.

It always helps to think of ship analogies. Lean into waves at an angle. Don't attack them head on or they'll tip you over. The same goes for fear. Lean into them lovingly and gently knowing you are going to get over that chrest. Don't dive into them in a foolhardy or you'll get slapped back hard and avoid fear even more. Fear exposure is about learning to get strong at a certain level, then taking 1 step forward to get stronger at the next level. If you jump straight into level 10 you'll get fucked. So just lean into your fears. The obstacle is the way.

Your anxiety and health issues are a blessing that you have not yet realised.

occult,fnmt5t3,t3_g2hvla,1587077676.0,"Non-Duality my friend. Advaita Vedanta. Shows these arguments for what they are. Filled with assumptions. God... if you want to use that burnt out word... is the trinity.

Both Poles and the Awareness that Pervades them. The conscious-Yin-Yang.

So why is there evil? Because everything needs an opposite for anything to exist! How could you know good without bad? Hot without cold? Love without hate. Life without death. You couldn't.

So God is everything. The rapist and the raped. But what is god essentially... essentially god is the eternal loving awareness that pretends that seperation exists. Everything that is, is happening to the one, by the one, and the only one that experiences it is the one. Why? Because that's Gods nature. It's like asking why is the colour white white? Couldn't the colour white be a different colour? No white IS WHAT IT IS. 

So God doesn't ""allow"" what you call evil. God is all. Far far beyond all polarities. The Para Brahman.

So these logical western philosophical arguments are actually extremely childish and nonsensical.

Every word... Every concept... Assumes a seperation that simply doesn't exist. It only appears to exist because that's how words and thoughts works - linear & dualistic concepts that attempt to divide an indivisable whole. So think about God all you want and drive yourself mad... or start really looking at your own nature.

NevilleGoddard,fnj3bug,t1_fm00drk,1586991176.0,"You can't if you don't understand the paradoxical trinity of your nature. You are both you, and what you also think is not you, and you are the impartial awareness of both (otherwise known as God or the Void or by a million other names) Once someone realises this and knows it well enough to dive into unknowing - non-being - nirvana - death - then they realise that the ideas you normally have about yourself are simply limitations based on believed falshoods - ""I could never do X"" - that belief is based on a belief that you are your thoughts about yourself. Once that is surrendered - once a person is truly willing to let go and jump into faith (not in anything - simply faith in not-knowing) then a person realises that they are already everything they ever wanted to be and so much more... life simply has to play out in time... but the result was never in doubt... you are what you are now and forever. You are your own worst nightmare and you are your own wildest dream. You are also and most essentially neither. The knowing void that is aware of both potentialities. The more someone realises that they are the full-void, the overflowing-emptiness, is the moment that the jig is up. They may look human from the outside... but they are no longer human. This person has lost their personhood. They are identical with life. They always were, but now they are no longer pretending to be the yin or the yang. They are the yin-yang-knowing-yin-yang-knowing-yin-yang-knowing. Also known as the Tao. Christ consciousness. Buddhahood. Being-consciousness-bliss. The Alpha (Nirvana) and the Omega (Samsara). This person no longer manifests because they are they are the manifested-manifestor.

One can know this sub-consciously. i.e. they don't have to be fully conscious of their own divinity. We are all conscious in different ways. Some have the gift/curse of the tree of knowledge - knowing what we are, but feeling may or may not reflect our knowledge. Our knowledge my be true (as in it is aimed towards a worthwile target) but that truth has not yet been embodied. That is known as a head awakening. All of the knowing - but none of the joy. That can be a numb and miserable place to be.

One can also know this in the heart, but not in the head: A heart awakening is much more commen, and it's where most successful manifestors find themselves. They know they have the power to affect reality and realise (make real) their dreams. They are not aware of the extent of their divinity and they aren't able to express their inner light and power verbally. This is the tree of life: living, loving, not knowing.

And then there are the prophets, saints, and buddhas: These people have realised their trie nature in both their head and their heart. Mental peace and clarity combined with an open and compassionate heart. Full of joy and love, but desireless and content. A balanced individual - the tree of life (body) balanced with the tree of knowledge (mind)

And then there are the messiahs: This individual has balanced all seven chakras and established themselves in being. They live only in the eternal now. They are unified and identical with life. Just as a wave moves in the ocean they are a vibration in allignmnet with the entire universe. Not resisting anything and not craving anything. Body-Mind-Soul. The body mind may appear to still be there to the onlooker, but all that is truly there is soul. And that soul contails all bodies. All apparent matter is simply god in drag. This messiah character delivers a message to whoever decides to listen....

You and I and the lord are one. You are identical with life. You are going nowhere, you've been nowhere, and you are nothing. No... Thing... Accept this truth and know that it is already done. You are it. Manifest from there. Create without the creator. Become who you are. Simply by knowing that you already are it. Life simply has to play it out.

Remember that the spiritual currencies are 1) Time and 2) attention. Whatever you give time and attention to will grow. So of you only think about success you will only succeed at thinking about success. Manifesting has an active component.you have to envision it, and then pay for it with time and attention. If you want to become the best guitarist ever, there's no sense in only mentally manifesting it, you have to envision it, then sacrifice your time and attention to your golden calf (becoming the best guitarist ever) through playing the guitar and practicing and dedicating your life to your God (musical success).

Now this can be done as a prayer - to uplift others and to spread love and enjoyment. In this case you aren't really devoted to becoming the best guitarist ever for your own egoic pride. You are manifesting this dream as a prayer. You are praising god (life) through your joy for music. This is no longer a golden calf - now your success will come with love and joy and light. You'll inspire millions and you'll spread your joy simply because you are joy. You aren't striving to become the best guitarist ever for fame or sex or money... you are doing it as an expression of love - and so you will be an expression of love.

However, if you manifest for fame, money, sex, or for other self-indulgent reasons... then you will still get what you want... but you'll lose yourself in the process... if you pay with time and attention to a golden calf (thou shalt not put false gods before me)... that guitar becomes a veichle where one actually moves away from love. There is a lack of awareness of what one is: a whole complete expression of god. So because that person is u aware of unity, they use their pursuits as a means to fill an unffillable hole in their soul. They'll use music to get what thet really want - indulgance - more for me - egocentricity. Unfortunately they'll get it all, but it'll lose all it's meaning and value quickly and that sense of alienation will still be expressed through addiction, depression and anxiety.  Life will seem worthless and people will seem horrible creatures. A person will manifest their own personal hell.

So when messing about in the spiritual and magival realms... be very careful what you wish for. You just might get it.

Here's the secret: Ask for nothing. Accept everything. Judge not. Want not. When true manifesting occurs... you take full responsibility for the universe which is where you find yourself. Accept that YOU aren't manifesting jack shit. Because there is no you. That's why people say ""All things through god"" or ""All glory to god"", because there is no seperation. No you & god & the world. There is only what IS. The indifinable unified field. The one consciousness. The consciousness that transcends oneness. The consciousness that transcends the concept of consciousness. The eternal knowing: I am that I am.

Now know that you are the manifested-manifestor-manifesting. You are the knowing-the knower-and the known.

It is already so, it has always been so, and it always will be so. Satcitananda"

collapse,fla46t1,t1_fl9k7wq,1584976253.0,Yeah I read that wrong alright 🙈
collapse,fl9h9gk,t1_fl98edz,1584955663.0,Oh for sure but for every death there'll be 10 births. I'm not saying the virus isn't awful - it is - I'm just saying that it isn't actually going to be what nails the coffin of human race imo. That's not too far away though. We seem to be entering a biblical plague type period. Poor Australia was on fire and now they have this to deal with also

reddevils,fl0d4wm,t1_fkz5no6,1584702078.0,Not everyone doesn't want to spend £150M. Everyone want's to spend €20M on an prospect that turns into a player that is worth £150M.
reddevils,fl09c25,t1_fky9zsh,1584697334.0,We literally broke Rasfords back by playing him too much 😅
reddevils,fkyhdfc,t1_fkyfoex,1584648765.0,Exactly. And Igalo has yet to show that he can't cut it. He has 2 or 3 years of fitness in him and he did have 1 amazing seson with Watford. Everyone is assuming that he won't be what we need even though they are happy he's doing well. It could very well turn out that he is exactly what we need and that he is a top top top striker. We haven't had all the evidence as of yet but if this was an exam and we judged him on his short tenure so far at united he's get an A+
reddevils,fkyav8k,t1_fky9zsh,1584645081.0,Great price offered lol that'd be the day
reddevils,fky8jd6,t3_flfa80,1584643755.0,"We don't need him. He's a great player, but with Rashford, Martial, Greenwood and Igalo I think we are ok in that department. He'd cost too much. He's quality, but it's not the right move imo"
reddevils,fkuikzm,t3_fksbsj,1584550087.0,Weird comment here from a united fan but I miss watching Drogba. He was absolutley amazing. Park too obviously :) lol
reddevils,fkr1om5,t3_fk7dk0,1584460104.0,This kid is going to be so so good
reddevils,fkqe3ri,t1_fkqdfpc,1584442316.0,Agreed
reddevils,fkq72qx,t3_fjsek7,1584433301.0,He still lacks something. Ability to become world class but not there yet. We all know he can be though
reddevils,fkq6jgn,t1_fkp7t7a,1584432640.0,"When he dribbles in the middle of the park in our own half, when he doesn't need to I get so angry. He lost the ball and cost us several important goals last season doing that and I lost my mind. Yes you are more talented than the other players - that doesn't mean you fuck about and play like you are in school with mates"
reddevils,fkq6c4a,t3_fk004s,1584432389.0,Harsh... but true at this point. He has a lot of work to do to re-establish himself as a great manager in this decade
reddevils,fkq5xwv,t1_fkq55yv,1584431909.0,"His football was boring. He signed aging players and few did well for more than 1 season (or at all). The youth players didn't progress as much as they could have. Fred, Shaw, and pretty much every defender were dogshit playing under him. Yes the Europa League was a great season and coming 2nd was a good achievement with that squad... but the culture was not a man utd culture. It was defensive football and any time we got ahead we'd sit on our 18 yard box and never attempt to attack again. It was abysmal to watch. The players he wanted to sign, before the start of the season he was sacked in, seemed to be more aging big names also (Perisic) Getting rid was the right move. He was living on what he had achieved in the past.

OLE has been a breath of freash air. Attacking football. Teammates playing for each other. Deadwood moved on or dropped. Youth doing excellently. Fantastic signings who are getting better and better. Clear progress shown. Positivity all around. (Aside from the Ole outers on Reddit that is lol)"
Semenretention,fkokacq,t1_fkohqad,1584388903.0,Ok all that is very interesting. I'll set a strong intention. Thank you

reddevils,fkguz9i,t1_fkg1rrz,1584175603.0,">I was there yesterday it was fantastic

So what. This comment was about coronavirus and events being held where large amounts of people come together. How fun the event was just shows that you are missing the point.

>His horse was racing today

And it still should have been cancelled.

>It's probably the last major sporting event held for a while

Yeah and it shouldn't have gone ahead. Italy has been on lockdown for weeks already and all the info about the dangers have been out there for a while.

>10 million people descend on london daily.

>Inter city rail travel is still the same as it was 

>People are still going to work

That doesn't mean that they should. Take personal responsibility."
holdmyfries,fkf4m8l,t3_fhylix,1584126952.0,This is why I am polite. You never know who is close to breaking point. I wat hed falling down. You never know who is a trainer killer also. Trainer fighers dispersed throughout the public. Pick the wrong person to be a dick to and it could end up like this very easily
reddevils,fkem7pe,t3_fi1cls,1584116073.0,"Awful that they decided to go ahead with Cheltenham. Greedy business-people.

Edit: Wow some of the hate here. The virus may be airborne but it still needs close proximity to pass it. A lot of people are going to die and avoiding crowds is a way of minimising that. Skipping a horse race may have been a good idea, especially when the rest of the world has already shut down events such as these and the WHO has declared a pandemic. I love sports and entertainment as much as the next person (devistated that there'll be no football for the next while) but we are talking about thousands of people dying here. Stay home for a while. The world and entertainment will still be there in a month or two"

reddevils,fk3nbgf,t1_fk3hkri,1583840558.0,Law wise... the decision will very likely be suspended until the appeal is sorted out. That'll mean that they'll most likely be allowed into the UCL next year and if they lose the appeal the ban will start the following season
reddevils,fk1ooha,t3_fg0j60,1583783891.0,He was my MOTM
reddevils,fk1ob6s,t3_fg0nbn,1583783687.0,It's obvious at this point. He's the messi of defensive full backs.
reddevils,fk02jdx,t1_fjyvr9r,1583738791.0,"Pogba lacks defensive tenacity IMO. He's a must against the smaller teams but he will not work hard enough defensivly against the likes of Man City. That's just my opinion. I think that's what makes Bruno better. Attack, defense, workrate, attitude, off the ball movement. He's the complete midfielder. Pogba is absolute class but he is not great when we don't have the ball and require dedication to the cause"
reddevils,fk01xv3,t3_ffo9nl,1583738009.0,Wan-Bissaka was my MOTM
reddevils,fk01gwt,t3_ffpcw3,1583737417.0,Everyone keeps talking about him as a rotation option... he may well become first choice yet if he keeps up his form. Unlikely... but you just can't fault him so far
reddevils,fk01e3k,t1_fjzuvqi,1583737325.0,That was brilliant. I believe in this guy
reddevils,fk01czx,t1_fjzyg10,1583737289.0,The story is he took a £200k a week pay cut to play for united
reddevils,fk017b8,t3_ffqcgo,1583737101.0,The more time passes the more it becomes Ole's vision the more we can judge him accurately. IMO he's the perfect man for the job
reddevils,fjyip67,t3_ffi2to,1583697595.0,We are actually turning into a class side. With Pogba coming back for the end of the season I wouldn't be surprised if we get CL football next year by either winning the europa league or finishing top 4
reddevils,fjycvq0,t3_ffftxi,1583694195.0,He was my man of the match today

reddevils,fjyclbw,t3_ffh4mr,1583694042.0,He had a great game. Still a little annoyed he didn't pass to Bruno for that earlier chance though. Great game from Martial though

reddevils,fjy9mi7,t3_ffgqaz,1583692481.0,He's fucking class in every way
reddevils,fjy2jj9,t3_ffflcr,1583688536.0,Martial may have scored but that decision to not pass to Bruno when he was wide open was really awful. That was a pass 100% of the time. Terrible decision to shoot. Selfish

reddevils,fjn1eod,t1_fjmfbyu,1583494253.0,Maybe. Just maybe. He is a quality starting striker. Time will tell
reddevils,fjmr5o2,t1_fjmr2i8,1583480325.0,Yeah. And Ighalo had 1 amazing season with Watford... no wonder a chinese team payed him the big bucks
