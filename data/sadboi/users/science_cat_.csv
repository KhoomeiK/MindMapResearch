How about this...

On my 21st birthday I spent the day moving house.carrying boxes up and down, hot and sweaty and tired. And the house I moved into was AWFUL. It was absolutely filthy. There was a dead rat in the kitchen, holes in walls, mould everywhere. Absolutely stank. So I spent the afternoon shouting at the letting agents, who were pretty much criminals. Made an appointment with the environmental health inspector. Thought I was going to be homeless. But happily me and my folks had made plans to see my grandmother for the evening and have dinner together, we‚Äôd even got a cake. But when we got there she had fallen and was unconscious, so we called an ambulance and did first aid and took her to hospital. And also phoned the emergency bracelet people who had been completely pointless as they didn‚Äôt come when she pressed the button. So I spent the evening waiting in the hospital, slowly finding out how ill my grandmother really was.

AmItheAsshole,ewxp6um,t3_cqin60,1565865018.0,"YTA. A year or so ago I realised that I was shaving and applying makeup not for my own enjoyment but because I felt I unconfident and ugly without it - I was sacrificing my time, money and comfort to look better for others. I believe that we should be confident and comfortable in our own natural bodies. So I challenged myself to only do ‚Äòbeauty things‚Äô when I feel like it. In practice that means I shave my legs/pits when it‚Äôs super hot and when I‚Äôve got fresh bedsheets cause it feels nice! Also I have more time in the mornings now so I get to sit on the balcony and read the news instead of maintaining body hair. And my husband supports me in this choice because in his words, it‚Äôs not his body, it‚Äôs mine.

How about we all just back off telling other people what to do with their bodies. OP, it‚Äôs gf‚Äôs choice what she does with her body."

CatAdvice,es7kkgf,t3_c687u9,1561672924.0,"I would advise driving. I recently drove across Europe with my two cats (moving house) and they were absolutely fine. We kept them separately in travel crates which each had a little water bowl attached to the door, in the back of the van, facing each other. I believe they both slept the entire journey. When we stopped at night we brought a familiar duvet into the Airbnb with us and they both slept soundly on it - after each taking a massive, stinking shit in the litter box! Ensure them breaks in the journey to pee. 

i Asked a vet wether it‚Äôs best to allow cats to roam freely in the back of the van, or put them in crates, and she said either is fine, but cats feel safe in a dark, quiet box and it‚Äôs no hardship that they have to sleep for a few hours at a stretch. 


On the other hand, a friend recently flew with cats from the us to Europe and she said it was fairly traumatic with security and the noise of the airport, plus the stress of the connecting train and taxi journeys with their luggage and the crates, and there was an incident with a cat nearly escaping. 

If you have the choice, I think driving is smoother!"

 I self harmed as a teen, I‚Äôm in my 30s now. Mentally I‚Äôm in a much happier place and the idea of doing it now seems so alien to me. I guess I understand myself better and have good coping strategies? Just want to say, that people‚Äôs mental health can and does get better. So for people out there who are in a bad place, hang on, things can improve.
Also, my scars never disappeared. They‚Äôre white instead of red now, but it‚Äôs pretty obvious what they are. No amount of bio oil or palmers or any of these silicone gel things helped. I‚Äôm hoping to get cover-up tattoos but I hear tattooing on scar tissue sometimes doesn‚Äôt work well. So for those who do self harm, if you‚Äôre able to, please tend to the wounds. You can buy antiseptic wipes and steri-strips (wound closure strips) from a pharmacy. It will minimise scarring for your future self. Just a thought, if you‚Äôre able.
