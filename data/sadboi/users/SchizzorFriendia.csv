A guy you think should go in the second might drop all the to the fifth or vice versa a team could reach on a late round talent way earlier than anyone ever expected.  So I know not all of these guys will be available when we pick again in the 5th.  This is just a list of guys I like that I believe MIGHT be available when we pick late.  So I'm not really interested in any of the 'oh he wont be there we have no shot at that guy' replies.  Again, past the first couple of rounds (and even in those rounds honestly) the draft becomes a total crapshoot.  

Antonio Gibson RB/WR Memphis- Most drafts I've seen have him landing in around the fourth, but Gibson is an explosive athlete with the kind of versatility Shanahan loves.  He's a RB with receiving skills that can play in the slot or even out wide if we need him to.  He's got the burst to get to the edge in our outside zone scheme and the bulk and physicality to shake off arm tackles and bounce off defenders for YAC.  The reasons I see him possibly dropping are because he only had one year of college production, and he was moved around all over the offense never giving him a chance to settle in one position making him a bit of a tweener.

Netane Muti OG Fresno State-  Muti's tape paints him as a legit first round talent.  He has the size and athleticism to bulldoze people in the run game and the anchor to hold up against just about any bullrush.  The only reason he's not being talked about more is that while his tape screams 1st round, he played only 19 games in 4 years due to injury.  I honestly have no idea where this guy is going in the draft.  It wouldn't surprise me to see him go in the second, or to see him go completely undrafted altogether.  If he can manage to stay healthy though I think he'll be a force at the next level.  Big IF though.

Thaddeus Moss TE LSU-  The son of legendary Randy Moss broke out with the tigers this year and showed some great receiving skills with the ability to high-point the ball while keeping his feet in bounds and securing it with strong hands.  He's also a beast of a run blocker who take pride in removing guys from the play.  Unfortunately he didn't really inherit his father's freak athleticism and could struggle to separate at the next level. 

Kenny Robinson JR S WVU/XFL- This is another guy I have absolutely zero bead on.  He played really well at WVU before being kicked out and in the XFL before their season was cut short.  But I haven't really seen his name mentioned ANYWHERE in any mock drafts which leaves his actual draft stock a total mystery to me.  He's another guy who could literally go anywhere in the draft and it would not surprise me.  Either way I think he'll be pretty good.  

Trey Adams OT Washington-  He's a big and athletic tackle prospect who was looked at as a potential 1st rounder before injuries derailed his college career, and could end up a decent value pick (depending on where he lands) as an eventual Staley replacement. 

Rodrigo Blankenship K Georgia- Big leg from Georgia with incredible consistency.  I wouldn't mind spending a late pick on a kicker.  I know we have Gould signed on for at least another year, but the way he gushed about Chicago last year really left a sour taste in my mouth and his production dipped dramatically from his first two years with us.  Shanny would probably stick with the vet over a rookie kicker though, especially in a year we'll be looking to compete for the super bowl.

> We didn't lose the superbowl because of lack of talent.

Of course not.  If we were lacking talent we wouldn't have even made it to the Superbowl.  But the interior of our O-line got destroyed in that game and no receiver had more than 42 yards through the air so I DO think that if we improved in those areas, our chances of winning go WAY up.  

> We can't look at this year as our last year to make it. We are building a dominant franchise here, and to do that, we have to look long term. If we have another fantastic season, we will be struggling hard to replace Staley, and that could majorly set us back.

And again, I don't think putting off grabbing a Staley replacement for another year is going to destroy our future.  We'll still have draft picks next year and there'll be plenty of other options if things don't work out with Skule/Coleman/Brunskill/McGlinchy including not just the draft but FA and trade as well.

Personally, I think we need to strike while the iron's hot while maintaining cap flexibility so as not to mortgage our future like the Rams did.  And so far I think we've done a great job of that.  I'm not worried about our future.  What I'm worried about is getting over that last hurdle."

Richburg's been dealing with a lot of nagging injuries for a long time now, and his performance has suffered for it.  Shanahan puts a pretty high priority on the C position too so I'm hoping we use

49ers,flpn02b,t1_flplezg,1585363451.0,"Judging prospects by simply looking at 40 times is an incredibly lazy way to evaluate talent.  Ruggs isn't just another speed guy.  He's a lot more physical then he gets credit for (routinely goes across the middle, takes big hits, and breaks arm tackles), has incredible hands (lowest drop rate among draft eligible receivers with just 1 drop on the year), AND he'll walk into the NFL as possibly the fastest man in the league (not just 40 time, but real on field speed). 

All that and he's still just scratching the surface of his unreal potential as he was originally a highschool basketball star who got a late start in football."
49ers,flp5b6j,t1_flozfqy,1585351963.0,"If Ruggs was so bad at route running, why was he was asked to run a wider variety of routes than the route running phenom himself Jerry Jeudy?

If he was 'just another speed guy' why was he running go routes so much more infrequently than every other top ranked wide out?  

And Lamb, really?  He's nowhere near as good a route runner as Ruggs.  His route running is probably his biggest weakness heading into the draft.  He'll need to improve a lot if he wants to get open against NFL DBs."

But platonic friends don't do these things for/with each other, and by continuing to do these things you're sending him the message that you're at least open to the idea of getting back together.

Personally, I just don't think Pettis is all that good at football.

Also, I sort of disagree with the idea of trading down (at least for this year).  Our roster is so stacked right now, I don't necessarily think there's a whole lot of room for rookies at the moment.  So I'd rather go for quality than quantity.  Though I suppose it really depends on what kind of value you can get in a trade down.

Right now my ideal draft is Ruggs at #13 (my preferred option of the top 3 WR though I know most probably disagree) and Cesar Ruiz at #31."
