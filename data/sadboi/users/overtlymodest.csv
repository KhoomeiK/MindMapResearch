Christianity,foqkewj,t1_fopxm47,1587995521.0,"I think you are doing what I did for years. The more educated I became, the more doubt I had in God. Spent nearly a decade without a faith. I think everyone could make an argument here. The best advice I can give you is this: you are using your conscience mind to understand something that is truly supernatural. You must be baptized by the water AND by the spirit. True Spirit is a state of being, an awareness, a blissful experience that is beyond understanding. You can go through an existential crisis and try to find the purpose, start, and end of life, but you’ll never know with certainty why life is. Who am I? What am I? What happens when I die? Who created me? Is life a puzzle that I need to try and solve? The question should be how. What state of being do I want to live my life in? Do I want to feel dark, tense, depressed, anxious, addicted, lost, empty? No, the light feels so much better. My how was with the Holy Spirit guiding me, because it is such a positive experience full of grace, truth, wisdom, and love. When you experience it, you have no doubt in God, whatever God means to you. Ask God to reveal himself and seek the positive energy in life. Leave the darkness behind, you just have to believe!"

Give me Mike Leach for 5mil AND give me Jon Heacock for 3mil! Set the precedent! The setup may help each coach feel more comfortable knowing that they can do what they do best and give each other the best opportunity to win. It’ll take the right pair, without a doubt.

razorbacks,f6btixr,t3_dqt1d8,1572778173.0,"This makes me as optimistic as the next guy, but we have done this all year. Starkel comes in and we think, why the hell is limp d*** Hicks even on the team. Sparkle throws 5 INTs and never really looks the same after. JSJ leads one good drive against Alabama in garbage time, and some say he is the only one who can run our offense. Grandpa probably paid Alabama to let him score, but we don’t care because he added a new element to our offense. KJ comes in and looks like the next coming of Sky Daddy Jesus Christ. 

QB is the centerpiece of any offense, but especially CCM’s. At the end of last season, he did the SMARTEST thing he could have done after missing out on Kelly Bryant- bring in his old QB who knew the offense, a winning SEC QB, and a promising freshman. They tried to put themselves in a position to succeed this year, and I think we’d all agree that it was a good plan, but those guys just didn’t get it done. 

All these QBs have their strengths and weakness. Do you go with experience, arm talent, speed, knowledge of the playbook? You’re not going to get all of them in one player. 

Hicks was the logical choice in the beginning. He knew the offense even if he lacked the physical tools to be a SEC QB. 

Starkel had SEC experience and even won some games. He had the canon, but no wheels. He didn’t really know the offense, and as a result he played like absolute garbage at times, ultimately wrecking Bieber Fever and his confidence. 

JSJ hasn’t really done anything wrong so to speak, but he doesn’t have all the physical tools either. He has the intelligence to play the position in our offense, but defenses will quickly game plan for him as he doesn’t really pose a threat to throw the deep ball or blow by defenders on the run. 

KJ has had ONE drive. He looked good, but I don’t want him to get Starkel’d because he doesn’t know the offense nor do I want him to become Austin Allen behind our terrible offensive line. 

The coaches know the QB room is terrible. They likely knew after 4 games that Hicks/Starkel weren’t the answer they were looking for. But what happens if they start KJ and he plays terrible because he doesn’t know the offense or how to read a defense? We’d be pissed for burning his redshirt on a terrible season, for throwing him to the fire too early, or at the coaches inability to coach/develop players."
