I'm telling you man, pain changes people. It can make people indifferent. But I think it's better this way, better than constantly being hurt all the time. The downside though is not being able to feel any kind of positive feelings for positive moments.

TrueOffMyChest,fh88ds3,t3_f1plx1,1581354278.0,"A little about me:

Been through a traumatic childhood (mental and emotional abuse, been manipulated by her a lot, been overprotected I felt like a prisoner), still a ""good kid"" nevertheless (based on other people's opinions), don't go out much, straight A student and made the honor rolls, I clean and do housework (sometimes tho my depression causes me to not get out of bed), But I am way far from perfect. I know that. I have made a lot of mistakes and bad choices in my life.

However, one time (I was already of legal age that time) a couple years ago during summer, my buddies (who were studying in another city far from home) came around and wanted to hang out, and I also wanted to unwind, so I told my mom I was going to be home late. With her being overprotective, she wanted me to be home by 9pm. I asked her if it was okay if I stayed a little later since my friends don't go home often and we missed hanging out, and that was when she got so mad just because I didn't want to come home just yet and started telling me awful things. She called and told me on the phone, ""You know what, maybe it would be better if you were dead.""

I get how children get on their parent's nerves sometimes, but I don't think they do to the point their parent wishes for them to be dead. So yeah"
