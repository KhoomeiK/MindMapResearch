ADHD,fpvr08f,t3_gbtau3,1588950233.0,I’ve been taking it 2 months and haven’t noticed anything - just FYI. It’s supposed to build up in your system for a few weeks before you should really notice any changes apparently. Started at 25mg and now at 80mg. Take it in the mornings. Trying to give it more time but I have an appointment with my GP in a few weeks for a follow up. Still super scatterbrained but less sleepy maybe. But I’ve also been working from home pretty much the entire time and actually getting decent sleep for once in my adult life. lol
ADHD,fpvqmys,t3_g1d6ol,1588950032.0,I’ve been taking it for 2 months - started with 25mg and now at 80mg - and haven’t noticed any changes except maybe constipation a few times but I’m already bad about staying hydrated. Been making it a point to drink more water / tea and haven’t had those issues since. No other negative side effects though. This is also my first ADHD med. Good luck!

Started Strattera about 2 weeks ago and haven’t noticed much of anyways. 2 weeks ago is also when I switched to working from home thanks to this coronavirus so my life / routine is a lot different now too. 
Hoping that Strattera will help with the ADHD symptoms (I like you “check all the boxes”) and help anxiety. Or at least not make it worse. I tried Lexapro for 3 months before this and it made me feel so on edge and fatigued all the time it was a no go for me."

lexapro,flc8gla,t1_fl8y5sz,1585022689.0,"Hi! Thanks for commenting! After talking to my doctor, who said I absolutely could take both, I decided to ween off Lexapro so only ended up overlapping about 3 days as I was tapering down. I took 4 days of half my normal pill (10mg cut in half to 5mg) then was supposed to do the 5mg every other day over another week but honestly ended up forgetting. I never felt any “withdrawal” or noticed anything different. I took the Strattera during the 4 days time I took the 5mg Lex and didn’t notice anything. I’ve taken 25mg Strattera once a day for a week now and haven’t noticed anything yet! That sounds like such a low dose compared to your 100mg! Lol! 

Stims aren’t an option for me right now so I have fingers crossed for Strattera!! 

I was on Lex for 3 months & only thing I really noticed was increased fatigue and honestly higher anxiety / paranoia. Didn’t notice a weight gain but maybe a little increase in appetite (or just increase in the desire to eat to comfort myself due to the heightened anxiety - lol! - damn vicious cycle!). 

Unfortunately (kind of?) with this COVID-19 and having to work from home, my normal daily routine is completely out of whack. So I’m wondering how I will be able to benchmark and compare Lex vs Strattera when my situation is very different now vs then! lol

Again, thank you for the reply! 😊"

I’ve been on 10mg Lexapro for about 12 weeks and haven’t really noticed anything at all / anything beneficial. Crazy dreams / increased night sweats / mildly heightened paranoid and anxiety / severe daytime fatigue. Haven’t noticed anything by way of weight gain at least! 
Diagnosed with GAD and borderline ADHD. I feel that my symptoms are more ADHD than GAD, but I’m not the doctor here. lol
Doc said Lexapro plus Strattera was an option or just weening off the Lex and going only with Strattera. I believe starting with a half of the 40mg pill for a few weeks. 
I think my biggest issue is the fatigue and lack of focus. Clearly I’m either not getting good sleep and/or it’s just straight up causing tiredness. If I have a day off work, I could legit get 9 hours of sleep and then easily go take a 3 hour nap in the middle of the day. Ridiculous. 
I guess I’m hoping Strattera helps to combat the fatigue / brain fog / time blindness / poor executive functioning / general lack of focus. 🤷‍♀️"

I’ve also always brought a litter box from home (currently have two set up - I’ll bring the smaller of the two) and some of the same kind of litter they’re using at home so it should smell familiar - I feel like that helps.
