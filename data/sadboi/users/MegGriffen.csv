You cant blame someone else for not doing what you wanted them to do. It's not like you hired a company to deal with it it was old people! Cut your losses and take this as a lesson learned.

AskReddit,fmwrbr7,t3_fxv8nk,1586451653.0,Worked as the manager of a wingstop locally. Quit being manager because I wanted something more for myself and decided to go to college. Boss was a micro manager and used to watch me like a hawk through the camera and question my every move. It was too much pressure. I am in college about 6 to 8 months after I quit and my old assistant manager offered me a job in the kitchen at my old wingstop. Took it it was a job I knew like the back of my hand. Once i start back and get back in my groove the owner comes up to me. He informs me that not only am I starting at less than the new hire employees but I will also be doing all of the management duties I had been doing without the title or the pay. I thought it over and halfway through my shift i took off the non slip shoes my boss had let me borrow and walked out the back door in my socks! It was the best feeling in the world!
