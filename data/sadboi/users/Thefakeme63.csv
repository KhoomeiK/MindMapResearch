Another part of me is incredibly afraid of the long term damage this is doing to the economy when I have zero faith in the state and federal governments to economically right the ship. My field of education is clearly not valued when it comes to budget decisions. Schools are already permanently closing and federal aid is being funneled to small, private and religious schools that don’t need it. It’s incredibly discouraging.“"

I saw a post from someone who at first had a job during the lockdown, and then lost his job during covid.  Watch the progression....

Just need to get this out somewhere. So, thanks in advance for listening/reading. My wife is really my only friend and I can’t keep burdening her with my unpredictable anxiety.
I should also preface this by acknowledging that I’ve been pretty lucky so far in the pandemic, and in life in general, I suppose. No one I know directly has even been infected. My job is teaching online for a public university, so I was quite used to the whole concept of quarantine before it started. My wife is a journalist and can largely do her job remotely as well. Even as I write this I feel supremely guilty for struggling with all of this so much, especially when so many people are experiencing something far, far worse.
I have such a crippling fear of the unknown in everything going on. As I’ve seen others mention here, my anxiety will swing wildly from feeling like I have a pretty good handle on things and feeling optimistic about the future to feeling like the walls are caving in and sobbing hysterically in bed. My university was already planning budget cuts (and likely faculty cuts) before the pandemic hit. Supposedly I’ll find out on Friday if I’ll be renewed for another year (I’m not tenure track) when the school budget is released. Pretty sure I’m safe on this round of cuts considering that I’ve been tasked with some large long term projects very recently, but it’s basically a given that enrollment will drop next fall. That’ll mean more cuts. My wife’s employer was also planning layoffs before the pandemic. You’d expect media outlets to be doing quite well right now given all of the traffic on getting news, but no one is buying ads since pretty much every company is in a financial crunch with the quarantine. We could probably get by with one of us losing a job, but the possibility of us both losing our jobs during the pandemic seems very, very real.
We just bought our house a few years ago in a great neighborhood and our kid would’ve been finishing his first year of kindergarten in one of the best school districts in the state. Now I’m juggling my regular teaching load with teaching him, and he’s having some pretty bad behavioral problems adjusting to this insanity. I feel supremely guilty (and worry about the long term effects, like passing on my stupid anxiety to him) for snapping at him and/or having to leave him alone to play by himself for long stretches while my wife and I work, but we have so little time to actually do our jobs from home. So now that there’s talk of the fall semester being impacted as well, it seems like there’s no end in sight.
I’d feel so much better about things if I had even the slightest bit of faith in the federal government’s ability to handle both the pandemic and the economic fallout. At the moment it just seems like they’re as rudderless as everyone else. I know every generation has to deal with some level of fear and uncertainty, but the whole world seems so incredibly more precarious now than it did last year. I should be happy. I have my dream job, I have a wife, I have a kid, I have a house, and I’m healthy. Instead, I live in near constant fear that all of that will go away.
Anyway, thanks for reading. I’m gonna go meditate.


One month later....

Found out about a month ago that my full time teaching job won’t be renewed next academic year. My wife is furloughed for one week a month. My six year old’s behavioral issues are gradually trending worse and worse, and quite honestly I’m sick of being around him 24/7. Things had been largely okay between me and my wife, but now it’s back to a familiar pattern of her getting incredibly angry at me with little or no provocation. Little things are blown up into massive arguments. To top it all off, I have what I think is an ear infection that I tend to get every year of so. After an evisit my doc she thinks I should get tested for COVID on Monday based on my symptoms.
Three months ago things were about as perfect as I could’ve hoped. Now it feels like everything is unraveling and I have a financial death sentence looming while my contract runs out. I’ve been slowly letting my daily upkeep slide with myself and stuff around the house (showering less, cooking less, chores, etc.). Just can’t shake this feeling that things will only get worse from here, and it scares the hell out of me to not know where the bottom might be. Not really sure what I’m looking for with this post other than to just get all of this out while I’m feeling very alone and hopeless."
