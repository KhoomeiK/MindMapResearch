How to take gabapentin the right way:

Take 300-600mgs every 30-45mins
EVERY TIME you take it eat a fatty food ( chips, avocados, cheese)
Drink an acidic drink like soda or juice 
DONT fill up to much on food because it won’t absorb as well so keep it light

On a side note, gabapentin takes about 2-3hours before effects are felt but once they are you’ll know, you can’t OD on it so don’t worry about that, and it’s a drug like kratom in the sense that you’ll have to find your sweet spot, some need only 900mgs, some need 3600mgs, but just take 300-600mgs until you feel it."

I’ve researched so much on this topic and the actions of the government is very reminiscent of old communist ways, they suppress the people so they have no free speech, they want any resistance to the government neutralized ASAP, and they will put people in reform in camps until they adapt the mentality of the government.

We're talking about a country that has cameras scanning everyone's face for no reason other then controlling the people and a country that rounding up Muslims and putting them in reform camps to be brainwashed and a country that doesn't allow journalists to report accurate information. All information comes from state-run newspapers and TV, they don't allow for people to protest nor do they allow people to practice free speech without the fear of being rounded up and disappearing forever. Now if you can give me accurate information and facts or sources explaining why you're saying that China isn't communist then please be my guest but from the outside looking in they are a very communist country and when you're in the country you will feel as if you're in a communist country. They may say that they are democratic but the president and his loyal people definitely use their power to suppress the people of the country and anyone who opposes seems to be suppressed very fast or is killed or kidnapped, they do this so they never loose power.
