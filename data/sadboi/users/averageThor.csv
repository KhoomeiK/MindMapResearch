schizophrenia,fgmkrxv,t3_ezcbqn,1580926579.0,"Yes! It's horrible. I'll clearly remember doing things at work and then get talked to for not doing it. I manage housekeepers in a hospital and some of it is very important. It used to be a lot worse, but over time it's become less common because I've started taking notes in my phone or a notepad at work when I do anything important. I can look up if I wrote something down instead of tracing my steps, and it has saved me a lot of embarrassment."

aww,ey5s78a,t1_ey59288,1566839102.0,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_corn

It's a primarily American and Canadian candy, mostly available in the fall. There are variants for various holidays as well with different coloring and, sometimes, flavor. Candy corn is roughly 2 cm long.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit

As this site is over 60% American or Canadian, there is nothing wrong with the idea of having a sub called r/CandyCornForScale. If it were an issue to create subs because of cultural differences, there would be no r/Australia or any other subs targeted at a specific group of people.
