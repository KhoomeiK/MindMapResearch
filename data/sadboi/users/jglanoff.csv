I’m in the process of trying to recover from/cope with my own mental health issues, and it oftentimes feels insurmountable and I just want one single solution to make life seem possible. I’ve learned some skills through my own therapy and online research that can help sometimes, such as behavioral activation, opposite to emotion action, ride the wave, self care, grounding, self compassion, self forgiveness, acknowledging cognitive distortions, thought challenging, thought decision, and building mastery.

I know I just threw a lot at you, and for me it’s difficult to find motivation to engage in any of those on a near daily basis. But if you’re looking for things to do to try and improve your mental health without medication. those may be worth looking into. Of course, different things work for different people, and many of those skills/practices may not work for you. But I’ve found in my own therapy that it’s oftentimes a process of trial and error.

That being said, I’ve also found that medication can be really helpful in getting me started toward improvement, especially since I regularly lack any motivation at all (like many others with depression, anxiety, BPD, bipolar, or other related illnesses).

Is there a reason your therapist is against you trying medication? Is she a licensed psychiatrist with the authority to prescribe medication? If not, it may be a good idea to make an appointment with a psychiatrist to be evaluated as well. Seeing a psychiatrist does not mean that you must take medication, and it also does not mean that you need to stop seeing your therapist. Seeing both a therapist and psychiatrist (or at least a therapist who is a qualified as a psychiatrist) could help you understand the pros and cons of medication, and if your situation could be helped with the aid of medication.

I’ve been going through this process for years, and I really like my treatment team. Sorry to inundate you with all this info that you may not have been looking for, but I’ve just been in your shoes before and thought I’d offer my experience. Let me know if you have any questions or just want to talk!"

So if you decline, I’m assuming that in the first three rounds you’d own the #2 pick, #12 pick, and #22 pick.

At the #2 pick you could get:
-Saquon Barkley, Michael Thomas, Dalvin Cook, Zeke

At the #12 pick you could probably get one of:
-Chubb, Julio Jones, D-Hopkins, Kelce, Kittle

At the #22 pick you could probably get one of:
-Patrick Mahomes, Austin Ekeler, Fournette, Kenyan Drake, OBJ, Golladay, Amari Cooper, DJ Moore, Miles Sanders, Mark Andrews, Todd Gurley, Chris Carson

So pick your favorite one guy from each group, and that’ll be what your team looks like if you decline the trade.

(For me it’d be Barkley, Julio, and Ekeler)

-
-

But if you accept, then in the first three rounds you have the #9 pick, #12 pick, #22 pick, and #23 pick.

At the #9 pick you could probably get one of:
-Davante Adams, Aaron Jones, Joe Mixon

At the #12 pick you could probably get one of:
-Chubb, Julio Jones, D-Hopkins, Kelce, Kittle

At the #22 & #23 pick you could likely get TWO of:
-Patrick Mahomes, Austin Ekeler, Fournette, Kenyan Drake, OBJ, Golladay, Amari Cooper, DJ Moore, Miles Sanders, Mark Andrews, Todd Gurley, Chris Carson

So pick your favorite one guy from the #9 and #12 groups, then pick two from the #22 and #23 group, and that’ll be what your team looks like if you accept the trade.

(For me it’d be Aaron Jones, Julio Jones, Ekeler, and Mahomes)

-
-

So pretty much just compare those groups and see who you like more. I see the #102 pick as fairly inconsequential; it gives up some depth but in a 10 man league you should still be able to find some depth late in the draft with your other picks. But all in all, I think I’d decline the trade. The #2 pick gets you a guy with the potential to have an explosive game nearly every week, and that’s just too good to pass up. He made a pretty good offer, and it gives you some really good power with your first four picks, but I just don’t think it’s enough to replace what you could get from Barkley/Zeke/Cook.

EDIT: This is the [link](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/consensus-cheatsheets.php) I use as a reference for who should be available around what pick."

EarthPorn,fn186ra,t3_fydjqx,1586556718.0,"Growing up I had never been interested in the outdoors, never hiked, never camped. The summer after my high school graduation I took a family trip to Tahoe, and kayaked around the pristine waters of Emerald Bay. My sister and I went out to Fannette Island and climbed to the lookout point on top. On my way back to shore, I took a detour on a small sandy inlet. As I put my legs in the cold water to pull my kayak ashore, a massive bird (maybe an eagle, maybe a hawk) swooped down and landed on a floating log not 20 feet away from me. I paused as the bird and I stared at one another; and it was one of those rare times in life where I felt wholly present. In that moment, nothing existed except my connection with that creature.

This lit a passionate fire inside of me. I went on to grow my passion for wildlife and the outdoors, studying Environmental Sustainability in college and spending every extra penny on hiking trips anywhere and everywhere.

The impact that Emerald Bay has had on my life and my identity is truly immeasurable, and this photo brought back a lot of that emotion and appreciation.

As it stands right now, we only have $14mil in cap space next year. Thankfully we don’t have too many integral pieces up for free agency next year, with the only major FAs being Tarik Cohen, Eddy Pineiro, Cordarelle Patterson, and Roy Robertson-Harris.

We’d probably need to cut someone like Trey Burton after next season (would save ~$7mil) in order to afford an A-Rob extension while also being able to fill some other holes (CB and OL).

Good news is that next year’s WR free agent class is stacked, headlined by Keenan Allen, Chris Godwin, Kenny Golladay, TY Hilton, AJ Green, Juju Smith-Schuster, and Cooper Kupp. So, if we do let A-Rob hit the open market, we may have a decent chance of retaining him with all the other stars out there. And if not, there’s plenty of other potential WR1 guys in that class we could go after."
