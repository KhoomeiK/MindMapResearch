depression,fcvyj31,t3_eb0ggo,1578013017.0,i found that writing a letter to myself when i was in a good mindset helps u in a sense. u just write out the good things about yourself and how no matter what it will get better although it takes time and it could take till the year before we initially die but at least we had that 1 year where we weren’t held down by the constant pain our minds and body’s put us through
