Im in the US, and some bike shops are actually open, given that because riding bikes can be done solo and is still considered an essential way to stay active (and therefore healthy). Bike shops are allowed to remain open to serve ridera during this time.

Take the bike to a local shop and have them replace your bottom bracket. That is what is broken on your bike. They will have the tools to remove your crankset and bottom bracket, and install a new bottom bracket and install your crankset. 

There are countless bottom bracket designs. Your bike mechanics will figure out which one you need and will be able to install it properly for you. Even if you have the right design, you will still need to know whoch dimensuons you need. Bottom brackets require their own tools, and some can be expensive, over all it would be easier for you to have a shop do the work, if you don't already have the tools and knowledge yourself."

Typically, a driver is responsible for what is right next to them and in front of them, and if a driver is behind them, then the driver to the rear holds the responsibility of maintaining a safe distance/ not ramming the car ahead/ not pitting the car ahead/ etc, but it seems like GT Sport goes opposite, it is like every driver bears responsibility for what is behind them, and not in front of them. It's literally backwards. Which is stupid, because if the cars are on the same lap, they are racing, and sandbagging or griefing isn't really the goal.

I wish Rockstar tried harder with the music... but also, the rest of the game, including all the sound effects, is so great I don't miss the music too much.

I mostly turned off the music sounds because whenever I turned off the radio station, background music would play that would drive me FUCKIN NUTS. I wanted to hear the car, plane, boat, etc. But the background music that plays even when you turn the radio off RUINS it. It's probably the second or third worst thing about the game for me. The 1st/2nd are character handling (running/changing direction speed, weapon handling, and the ragdoll physics. Man, the ragdoll physics really piss me off).

Restricting blood flow to any part of your body is not good for it, and if you are a courier, and your saddle cuts blood off, you should definitely search for a saddle that is more correct for your anatomy .

Now unlike handle bars or pedals, the saddle is the one contact point for your body and bike that you should try to educate yourself on as much as you can, and try as many saddles as you can and selecting the one that fits your anatomy the best.

I strongly suggest you don't take other people's opinions on good/best saddles for you very much because everyone's anatomy is different, and unlike handle bars or pedals that have adjustablility, the saddle either fits you or it doesn't. 

I can't tell you where to begin or what to looks at first but I'm going to suggest trying as many saddles as you reasonably can.

I've had problems with pain/numbness on the area behind my testes and between my legs in the past, I never got a new saddle because the ones I had available to try out (which will be very limited for you by the way) all didn't fit any better than the stock Oval saddle on my Fuji road bike.

I must also warn you that if you don't ride with serious consideration for your member, your performance may suffer. I have no experience with this but I have heard this from friends who I have rode with."

gtaonline,ff72ajl,t3_ercxs9,1579639691.0,"Yeah man, I don't think some people understand how much heist initial cost and setup costs are, it adds up, especially when the leader fails left and right.

For example, for the prison break, I had a bunch of strangers help me. Every time. There was at least 20 failures all together (mostly Police Station/Cargo Ship and Stealing the Bus) 

When the time came for the actual heist itself, The only way for me to make money (after getting the hit for all the stupid ammo costs, which I bitched about in another post) was by putting everyone's payout to 5%. I hated doing it, but it worked, and I barely made like 40k, basically the same as everyone else."

AskReddit,f3p0788,t3_dhc7vw,1571036233.0,"I (Male, 21) have 2 outstanding inquiries that bring me down, even though they are completely innocent/normal.

The first is about sex/relationships/girlfriends, etc. I have never had a girlfriend, I'm a virgin, never held hands, anything. I have a lot of female friends and I'm completely cool with women, that is no problem, I'm not incel or anything. I just get stymied by my crippling insecurities and the fact that have zero relationship/sexual experience. I feel like it's too late now, since it seems like everyone has been dating since middle school. 

&#x200B;

The second is far worse than the first for me. It is when people ask about how my bike riding is going, or ask when we can go riding next, or any similar cycling related questions. 

I have been riding bikes, running, and generally being very active since 2012. However ever starting in 2016 I started having heart rate issues, which deteriorated over time. My last good year of riding was 2017. After that my heart got worse. In 2018 I could barely sustain riding and here in 2019 I have some sort of heart rhythm disorder that gives me erratic heart rates during exercise or stressful situations, and I have had about 9 runs of ventricular tachycardia (yes, the /\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ rhythm, for those who know). For those who don't, it's a pretty deadly heart rhythm to be in. Second only to ventricular fibrillation (should I mention WPW?).

I can't ride anymore and I don't think I will ever be able to. I have some sort of rhythm disorder that will probably be what kills me. I'm taking beta blockers at the moment to mitigate the chances of me achieving high enough heart rates to trigger vtach- they all occurred over 180 bpm. There are far far more details than this, and I would only post them to prevent people from popping up with their own conclusions or opinions on my heart. I am getting treated for it, however all tests I've had come back with normal results. Literally everything. I have had portable EKG monitors on (24hr Holter & 2 week event monitors) and those I've gone out and induced vtach and other arrhythmia so I can show the docs that something is actually wrong. That is how vtach got diagnosed. I may have long QT syndrome but it isn't very pronounced at this point.

Cycling was one of my greatest passions and I always envisioned that no matter what in my life I would always try to remain active and ride as much as I could. Then at 21 years old, my heart gave me the finger and now physical activity is out of the question. I get emotional whenever I think about it. I loved riding so much. Now it's just a memory. Now, when I have more money than ever before, and better schedule to ride with, I can not ride. It could cost me my life."
GuitarHero,f0rnlym,t1_f0l54e5,1568888400.0,That's what I started using a few months ago and was able to beat the last 2 sets and Lou on Expert! Before I had the wireless Les Paul and it sucked :/ the orange stopped working after a while and towards the end green would fail about 5% of the time. Now I have 2 Xplorers and I play every weekend with my friends.
GuitarHero,f0rnev9,t1_f0rldct,1568888252.0,"I have one (literally threw it in the trash few hours ago) for Xbox 360, the wireless Les Paul.
The physical connection between the bpdy and detachable neck deteriorated over time, and thus the electronic connection between the 5 fret buttons and the body became spotty. Eventually orange stopped working, and about 5% of the time green didn't work. Had to toss it.
Months ago I picked up the one-piece Xplorer guitar from a friend and it's freaking perfect. It's wired so no worries about batteries. It is always on and always working. I was able to finally finish the last 2 sets on Expert and beat Lou (I started playing 2 years ago after buying GH3 and the Les Paul on Amazon). Because the guitar actually worked.
I just picked up a second Xplorer a couple weeks agoand now multiplayer is FANTASTIC. No more missed notes, both players can jam out. I wish they had better designs for the wired guitars.
I should add that it is actually a Xbox guitar and I just had to buy an adapter (maybe $7?) To get the Xbox connection to a USB to plug it into my Xbox 360."
AskReddit,eysesdf,t3_cyjqg4,1567395760.0,"Massage. 
Like, getting to explore a woman's body, getting her oiled up, feeling her whole body, head to toe. 
Massaging her shoulders and breasts, going down her belly to her hips, then down her legs, back up to her pussy, and rubbing it slowly, pleasuring her slowly.
Flipping her over, rubbing her back, down to her hips, and down to her legs, rubbing every part of her, exploring her, feeling her. Then up to her booty, massaging it slowly, teasing her pussy every now and then.
Then finish by making love to her beautiful, smooth body. Kissing her and touching her, telling her how beautiful she is and how good she feels.

I fantasize about this very often tbh, but I'm single right now :/"

bikewrench,eypn1yj,t1_eypmlh1,1567304938.0,"Armor is a necessity, especially in combat zones. This ""lock washer"" isn't and there isn't even real evidence showing that they work. They just come with hardware kits seemingly by default."
bikewrench,eypf03v,t3_cxzzng,1567298200.0,"I've worked with a specialty bike shop on mountain bikes specifically for law enforcement and security agencies for years now. All our bikes post-2014 have disc brakes, mechanical and hydraulic. 

I have NEVER seen such a piece on any bike. The rotors are always secured only by the 6 bolts (or lockring, but that doesn't apply here).
I've seen bikes with 1 or 2 loose/gone rotor bolts that basically function fine. The thread locker does it's job 99% of the time. A piece like that is unnecessary. 
Remember that these patrol bikes always patrol either 8,16, or 24 hours per day, but usually they are on patrol for 16 hours, or 2 shifts, a day.
These bikes see a lot of abuse and we work closely with bike and part manufacturers to deliver the best products for our clients- which include Los Angeles Airport Police, Los Angeles Police Department, Santa Monice Police Department, Pismo Police, and sever high tier security agencies- such as Allied-Universal, Andrews International, Securitas, and Andrews Global.

If this part was necessary because it improved safety or performance, it would be present. But it is mysteriously absent, even in the demanding environments of patrol on the beach and in downtown areas.

Don't worry about that part. Sell it back to your local bike shop for a quarter each. And simply make sure there is thread locker on the threads and that they are properly torqued."

One of my good friends is (I can't say anything nice here so please bear with me) totally immature and socially inept. For years myself and my group of friends have been trying to straighten him out. To teach him social skills and etiquette. But he doesn't listen or grow. He dwells on being depressed and how his family doesn't really care for him and similar. But he's 21 already and he just will not grow up. He has no motivation for self improvement. When we go out to places (say, the local burger joint) they basically ignore him and always talk to me. They don't really like him because he acts weird. He always talks about how no one cares for him and how he has nothing going for him. When in reality it is all because of the way he conducts himself. We try to help him but he won't listen, learn, or grow. I'm honestly getting real tired of him now."
