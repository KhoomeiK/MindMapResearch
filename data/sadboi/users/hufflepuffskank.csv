My friends and I would go into the bathroom during recess and make fun of her from outside her stall. We learned at some point that she regularly went in there if she drank milk at snack time, so we would follow her in and yell things like, ""Oooo are you poopiing?"" ""It stinks in here!"" for several minutes before laughing and walking out. I feel so horrified of what might have happened to her because of our bullying. I don't know if it was as intense as I remeber it being or if it was actually no big deal, but it's really stuck with me, and I'm afraid to know the truth of how harmful my actions might have been."

Sure, the weed distracts me from the thoughts that were distressing me, but the nature really makes me feel refreshed and not so bogged down. And then there's an added benefit for my old man beebee boy cat. I have to supervise him any time he goes outside since he's blind and kinda dumb, so since I started going out often, he's gotten lots of opportunities to come with me and play in the grass."

It's the same as someone taking up a second seat with their bag on public transport or something. There's nothing wrong with doing that when the space is free for you to spread out on, but if the extra space you were taking up with your bag or legs was the only place left for a person to sit, it's just plain unkind to continue to take up that space.
Unless your scrot is messed up and you really do need that space to be comfortable on your way to the hospital."
