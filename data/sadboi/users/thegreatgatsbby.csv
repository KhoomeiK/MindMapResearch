depression,fl4tnd4,t1_fl4rekb,1584821196.0,"That must be tough, getting out, hanging out with people, and even just walking around and being more social made me a little less sad and more happy, but now I can’t do that with this quarantine so :( I wish you good luck tho <3"
depression,fl4kpno,t1_fl4b2hb,1584815615.0,Thanks ur comment means a lot
depression,fl1c7nm,t3_fltp8a,1584726124.0,"I feel this, I’m not saying I’m suicidal but I do get creepy, scary thoughts sometimes when I’m really sad. The only thing stopping me from doing it are the consequences and how it would affect my family and friends. So if they just died or disappeared then I could finally end the pain. As bad as that sounds, and as evil as it is. 

I wish you the best <3"
depression,fl152a5,t3_flm931,1584722153.0,"I really feel this, not only have you lost people in your life, but now this virus has made you even more lonely and isolated thanks to the quarantine. The whole coronavirus thing really is a big overreaction and it’s hurting a lot more people than the media and public believes. It’s isolating already lonely depressed people, it’s hurting me, But you have to keep fighting, never give up, even when things are really bad.

I wish you the best <3"
depressed,fl14ktu,t3_flsyvn,1584721888.0,"Every rant is special, and I really do feel your pain. At the same time I want everyone to know what’s wrong with me, that I’m depressed, so they can help, but on the other I don’t want everyone thinking this is all I am. Some sad, lonely, worthless person. And so I want to run away from it all, from everyone, but what I’ve learned is you can’t, no matter how bad things get, no matter how sad u get you have to stand your ground; running will only make it worse. 

Keep fighting <3"
depression,fl012pg,t3_flogqa,1584687275.0,"I really felt this because as a depressed person I can say for a fact that it’s very hard to talk to anyone about anything especially your depression. With the friends I have if I started talking about me being sad or my depression, they would get angry with me and make fun of me for being weak and pathetic.

<3"
depression,fkzm7zw,t3_fldr2o,1584674349.0,"Literally this is so true omg. I feel this. Everyday rather than being supported and complimented, I’m called lazy, worthless, and how I haven’t accomplished anything and I’m pathetic.

I feel your pain <3"
depression,fkzbiaw,t3_fldu03,1584667152.0,"With this quarantine and everything I’m with you, it’s making me feel even more lonely and even more isolated :("
depression,fkkqu0u,t3_fj15uq,1584290008.0,"All the time, like ur the only person that not only cares about urself, but ur the only person that thinks about how ur feeling, admits that u exist, and thinks about in general. Sounds like ur alone in this world just like me, it’s like we’re ghosts and no one can see us or see what’s happening."

depression,fk7auyu,t1_fk78i94,1583932343.0,"The negatives r SOOOO overpowering lmao like omg it’s hard to even find any positives in my life and if u do happen to find positives, so what ur still sad and lonely lol. So I defiantly feel that emptiness and feeling like ur worthless."
depression,fk7apdl,t3_fgvzt5,1583932235.0,"I feel that, my life is somewhat the same, I feel like I’m the only one who cares about anyone, but no one (not even my family) cares or at least shows they care about me, it sucks and makes me rly sad. It’s like I’m waisting my life feeling like this and I know it won’t go away, but I hold out hope that it might u know. We can chat if u want or if u don’t it’s fine :) just know ur not alone <3"
