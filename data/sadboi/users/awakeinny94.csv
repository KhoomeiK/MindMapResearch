YouShouldKnow,fpyvrxk,t1_fpx6nni,1589009722.0,Yeah it would cost at least $150 each time if I paid someone hourly. Plus picking up and dropping off laundry. Another $100 at the least. I spent $400 a month in cleaning when I lived in Virginia. All chores except for laundry. That was extra. It was a professional service and very satisfactory.

YouShouldKnow,fpyuc2i,t1_fpwictm,1589009258.0,$200 a month is extremely reasonable. It costs $200 a month for someone to do just my laundry. It would probably cost about that much to have someone come and clean just once.

Needafriend,fpyjl9n,t3_gfz70p,1589005018.0,"What you have said is true for most other platforms as well. The connectedness that the internet seems to provide is in fact far from real. People detach easily on online platforms and in real life too because there is the paradox of choice. We have an extreme amount of choices in who we interact with and we are so connected that we come into contact with so many more people than we we ever would have a few hundred years ago virtually or in real life. Even when we claim to look for a friend we have already built a mental paradigm that causes interaction with others to be expendable and replaceable.

Wellthatsucks,fpdijfy,t1_fpd19bo,1588527671.0,You’re right! I was diagnosed with GERD. Completely forgot about that. It’s no longer a problem for me. I treated it by eliminating high FODmap foods from my diet and re-introducing them slowly. I avoid some foods now. I try to avoid alcohol entirely. It’s not worth it anymore.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fpdi36f,t1_fpd1uqk,1588527417.0,"The problem is definitely her. I never understood people who felt the need to comment about anyone’s anything ever. My sister did this. Made comments about my teeth, my height, my nose etc. I realized it came from a place of deep insecurity. She was probably always conscious of herself and thought I was the same way. I would see it in her mind when she was about to say something that she would relate it to herself first. It was a weird way of soothing herself about something she didn’t like about her own appearance. As if verbalizing what she considered my shortcomings silenced the voice she had about her own. I never said a word. At the age of 16/17 she told me in a terrible frenzy how people considered me more beautiful than her, how she wasn’t as pretty and so on. She went on to take this stance in every argument. She was overlooked, I was favored and so on. In her defense I probably was in some ways. I did better than her in school, was a first born etc. I tried my best to include her, even moving with her when I moved? setting her up with an apartment, car, job. Eventually we stopped speaking a few years ago because she never let go of that notion that we were in some kind of competition. That insecurity turned into bitterness and eventually hatred. I realize there’s nothing I can do because the problem is with her not me.


Now, I had a friend who would do this too. She too was secretly insecure. Her way of handling it was by making  comments about me. I withstood it for a while then when I got fed up. I started making comments about her every time she made comments about me. She would recoil like someone who had been physically slapped. The look on her face. I knew it wasn’t nice but I kept it up, tit for tat and subconsciously something turned. She stopped saying anything about me. Once in a while she would forget and say that my teeth were too long looked like a rabbits and I would say her face dropped on one side, did she know she looked a bit lopsided? In the nicest way. Soon enough the comments stopped completely. Her brain made the relationship - a comment about my appearance only brought her pain. I wouldn’t suggest you do this to your sister because it is not good to hurt someone you care about but maybe try to have a conversation about it and let her know her comments affect you. Maybe if I had had a conversation with my sister instead of brushing it off we would both have laid out our vulnerabilities and gotten closer instead of drifting apart."

Wellthatsucks,fpbjtnx,t1_fpb6wfe,1588471659.0,"That sounds like a lipoma. 12 years ago when my mother left us I started noticing these small painless hard round smooth lumps under my skin ( they were probably there all along and anxiety made me notice them ).

2 years ago I wanted to take advantage of my work insurance and I had one biopsied. It was just a fatty node. The doctor said that if they have been there for a long time and don’t change in size or appearance it’s probably nothing. I now have a small scar on my arm that looks like a spaceship to remind me. 

I was also sick often as a child and my mother’s anxiety about me kinda made me a bit of a worrier when it came to my health. You can have a doctor take a look for peace of mind :)"

mentalillness,fonwvm8,t3_g8e5ze,1587928060.0,"This sounds like me when I was undiagnosed bipolar. I was living in a small town in Virginia and I thought I was going insane. Hardest years of my young adult life. The doctors were shit, hardly knew what they were doing. The medications had terrible side effects. Finally got a doctor to do a MAPP test which is a DNA swabs that figures out how you metabolize meds. I was able to keep away from the ones with bad side effects.


Eventually I realized I had to move if I was ever going to get better. I saved up a little money, quit my job, moved to a bigger city and found a good psychiatrist. When I first started seeing him I thought I was beyond help. What a difference a good doctor makes. I went from 5 medications to three to two to one at the right dosage. Now I take an antipsychotic and I have a benzo just in case I need it. 

I have bad days but it’s nothing like I had those years ago. It’s manageable and I can always pick up the phone and call the doctor. The decision to find medical care saved my life.

He helped look for this apartment as he is native to NYC and set up almost everything bulky indoors. I fell into a trap where I thought he was a misunderstood person who needed my help. He lives with his parents at 38. That should have been my first red flag but I chalked it up to Asian culture. I have never given anyone else a key to my place. I am normally quite jumpy about things like that. He has always been such a reserved and mild mannered person. I doubt I can ever grant someone that amount of trust again.
