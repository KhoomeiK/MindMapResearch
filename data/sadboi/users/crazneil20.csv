schizophrenia,f9ey83t,t3_e4r1s9,1575254647.0,Sometimes I walk around my house talking to a guy about all kinds of stuff and then realise why the hell will there be a juggler in my house at 3 O' clock in the morning.
lgg7,f94f7yi,t1_f93lo71,1575086365.0,Ah that's too bad mate. I recently started using the hd voice recorder and I liked how customisable it is. I really hope you'd figure out a workaround real soon.
lgg7,f94exg4,t1_f949lt8,1575086098.0,"My version of firmware (Indian) didn't have official bootloader unlock. So I sideloaded another firmware (European I think, I don't remember) and mounted it to unlock bootloader. Then used the usual flash method for magisk. 
Right now I'm not using any third party rom as I fear I'd lose the quad DAC setting and various other stuff that are being reported in the xda forums. I'll wait for a stable rom. Check out xda forums to get a better idea on how to root. 
Honestly not much to do as of now with the root, other than some magisk modules. And of course stuff like lucky patcher. I'm not even using xposed as it will trip the safetynet check."
lgg7,f9499x4,t1_f92jqqf,1575081175.0,I rooted my g7 so that's no longer a thing of a concern anyway lol
lgg7,f92ge1f,t3_e3df8x,1575029912.0,I've never used lg phones before and now I'm in love with my g7. Love the audio. That was the main reason I got it and now I'm thoroughly impressed.

schizoaffective,f5goxb0,t1_f5ge9o9,1572195577.0,Ah witcher 3 never gets old. Hundreds of playtime and I haven't even got into the dlc storylines. Just completed the base game for like 3 times. Saving the dlcs for later.
schizoaffective,f5gof6m,t1_f5g2t62,1572195463.0,Being a schizo and playing hellblade with headphones-on definitely felt weird. Lol. Hope you're having a good time though. Happy gaming.
schizoaffective,f5go29t,t1_f5fw21b,1572195363.0,I feel you. Been feeling the same. So recently I'm just sticking to MMOs coz they're grindy enough to keep you going. And story-driven games are always a feast. But I do relate to what you're saying. They're not the same anymore. Or maybe we aren't.
schizoaffective,f5gnn3k,t3_dnt8sz,1572195234.0,"I play all kinds of games all the time, like atleast 2-3 hours a day. But recently I've put aside every other game and just sticking to ""Final Fantasy 14 online"". Playing ""Outer Worlds"" , ""Control"" and ""Man of Medan"" sometimes. 
I recommend you try out different MMOs available and find one that suits you, one that you wanna invest time in. It's like I have achieved a saturation in gaming.......I'm no longer getting agitated over bad games or desperately waiting for the most awaited ones. I just stick to FF14 and TESO. I do enjoy some new story-driven games every now and then."
