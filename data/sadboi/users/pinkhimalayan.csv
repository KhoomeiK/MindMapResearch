Largely because of the cost...! How many people don’t even have the luxury to see said specialists and docs in the first place?!

What drew me to her writing — humour, stories, relatability, clever concepts — is long gone now. Who is she? I unfollowed her insta account yesterday because I can’t abide by what she’s doing, how she’s doing it, and how she’s speaking to the people who’ve been there since the start and/or care about her and her family’s wellbeing. She used to be funny and kinda crass in a sassy, smart way, but not ever in this cruel, aggressive, out-of-control way."

blogsnark,fikpmkm,t1_fik6bzo,1582484859.0,BOOM! Connie’s bringing it! And she’s not wrong. Especially about how Heather is losing readers now. Nobody follows a person/blogger just to be jerked around. Truly dooceappointing.

One person made a truly respectful, tasteful, and thoughtfully worded comment about following Heather this whole time and feeling confused about how this has all become a ‘bit’. Heather’s reply had this exasperated, hostile, aggressive tone. This (kind) person who *dared* to be concerned and ask for clarity got gobbled right up.
