Mistborn,fpnxsae,t1_fpntpll,1588774706.0,"Yes! Same to me! It was indeed a bit of a cringe sometimes. I got pissed with Marasi blushing all the time after Vins tacit firmness that I absolutely looked up to. It feels like Brandon wanted to write a character similar in their imperssivness to Era 1 characters so he came up with Wax, but he felt more of a snob to me most of the time (despite his passion for Lessie) compared to Vin who was both incredibly strong and fragile in her willingness to change her distrustful attitude (thus becoming humane). And there was nothing grand for me about Sets plans compared to what happened in HoA for example. Guess, we are for epic fantasy rather than lighthearted stories?"
Mistborn,fpnwoab,t1_fpnmzum,1588774095.0,"I found suggestions to start Era 2 right after Era 1 and then turn to Secret History (currently on it), so... I understand that Era 2 is completely different. It seems I just didn't give myself time to let go Era 1 characters and went straight into Era 2. Didn't prepare myself for new characters. Guess, it was a wrong thing to do especially after connecting to Era 1 characters so strongly.  
Which, if you think about it, means that Era 2 characters were written just fine (I wouldn't have disliked them if they were not written well, if you get what I mean)."
Mistborn,fpnvqzn,t1_fpnptx8,1588773572.0,"Dude. That is exactly what I did. I was blown away by HoA ending and couldn't recover for a solid week after that. Thought AoL wouldn't hurt and it went down spiral for me. Guess, should have vent a bit after that but just couldn't resist starting another Brandons book (been reading his series non-stop since last summer, haha :))"
Mistborn,fpnv4fs,t1_fpnnwy5,1588773216.0,"To each their own, yah? :) Western vibes are what kept me through Era 2 actually. And Wax and Waynes skirmishes for sure! :)"
Mistborn,fpnux6q,t1_fpnoor8,1588773103.0,"Yeah, you know... I think you're right about me connecting Era 1 and 2 so strongly together. Guess, I went with it cause through the narrative Brandon mentions multiple times that Era 2 takes place hundreds years after Era 1 and it made a strong connection for me somehow.   
I understand that Era 2 is a different story with unique characters and its own atmosphere and strongly agree that it was real fun to dive into the magic system better (especially for me being a nerd in those types of things).  
Maybe I needed some time to let go emotions after HoA. It had such a bitter sweet ending that touched me so deeply, that it was a mistake to start reading Era 2 asap.  
Thanks for giving me a new perspective, it was kinda eye opening! :)"

mentalhealth,fmnnw5f,t1_fmm2n9v,1586230562.0,"Yeah, got you buddy. You don’t have to push yourself hard, you don’t have to push yourself forward now because you’re not in that period of time where you’re feeling fully awaken, fully at strength and peace. I think, your goal now could just be staying alive, battle for your safety (both mental and physical), taking a little care of yourself even if it seems absolutely meaningless. When I was having really hard times with my mental state (self harming, having severe anxiety and OCD symptoms mixed with ED, trouble sleeping, etc.) at one point I imagined that I was both a child who needs protection and attention and a parent I always wanted to have. It helped me build some kind of loving attitude towards myself and I haven’t been cutting myself ever since. 
Try doing small things to help yourself even if it’s like lying in bed all day (if that’s what your body needs) or having a yummy snack to feel satisfaction. It’s about small tender steps now, not heroic actions."
mentalhealth,fmlju0p,t1_fmlf0sx,1586187829.0,"Hey, guys, I was just passing through and stumbled upon your comments. Just wanted to say that you should consider at least one person who is worried about you and your wellbeing and it’s me. I do so from my own story of dealing with shitty mental state when I wanted to commit suicide multiple times and there was no one to turn to. Still don’t comprehend how I went through this. I feel deeply both of you and hope that this shit will stop. Please, stay with us a little longer. You will be missed by so many that you know already. And so many won’t get any chance to experience a variety of moments both deep and hard and happy with you (or about you). I’m with you mentally, please try to stay determined and resistant to everything you’re battling with right now. I believe in your abilities and powers. We all got it. We can do this. We will do this and we will stand our ground."
mentalillness,fmhudby,t3_fvaz2k,1586093777.0,The title of your post just made me smile broadly so I wanted to share my joy with you. I love those kinds of revelations. I love when people find will and hope and happiness from nowhere else but themselves. Wish you a very kind and peaceful morning and relaxed day. I believe in you and your inner strength. You got this!

The moment I saw your commission those colors filled me with so much warmth and serenity and  took all anxiety away. I’m at peace now thanks to you, so thank you. And please keep going. If you’re not already known for your gorgeous works you will be, I’m sure."
EatingDisorders,fmdsbm3,t3_fufe3e,1585976413.0,"I just bursted with “Oh. My. God!” right after I saw your post. That’s exactly what I’m dealing with right now - I have mild OCD and ED combined in some vicious mental issue. I’ve been thinking about making a post of my own considering my problem with rituals around food and specific patterns I have to follow but held back for a while and not a day later I see your post! :)
I really hope you’ll find a way out of your routine. I’ve thought about OCD and came to a conclusion that in its core lies fear for punishment. If you do something wrong (like breaking your pattern of actions)... you get punished, you hurt. A lot.
Do you have strict parents who made you do things their way under fear of being abused? It may have come from that way of behavior except you are that parent for yourself now. Take time to think over why you become anxious of breaking your routine and why it has to be related to food consumption (again maybe you were forced to eat even when you didn’t want to when you were a child or you didn’t have enough food growing up... Analyze your story and try to make reasonable connections).
Best of luck! At least you now know you’re not the only one in your struggles! :)"
