AskReddit,fkyx2iy,t3_fl944n,1584657976.0,"This is a story I thoroughly believe no one knows because I’m still embarrassed about it. 

So, when I was 16 I really REALLY wanted a pug. I had a puggle already and thought she needed a friend and so I went searching for one. I found a pug on Craigslist and it was the most adorable thing I’d ever seen. I contacted the owner and asked where I could pick up the pug. They said that they could ship the pug to me because they had cancer and also lived in Georgia. 

Still absolutely no red flags at this moment in time, I really wanted that pug. So the /owner/ asks me to wire him some money through Moneygram, 160 bucks. Well, I’m so excited I’m about to get a cute little pug so I wire him the money. The address for the money was to someone in Texas with a completely incomprehensible name. Little 16 y/o me is just so excited and still sees no red flags. 

Fast forward a couple days later, I get an email from a /pet shipping/ airline asking for more money. Now I’m a little suspicious, not only was it the phishiest email I’ve ever seen but this time they asked for $300. 

I said no, and they kept pushing. They said the pet was gonna be delivered today and I needed to give them more money to have it released to me. I said no and tried to call the number I was using to text the owner. It was a TextNow number and no longer responded to me. 

And that’s the story of how I got scammed on Craigslist."
