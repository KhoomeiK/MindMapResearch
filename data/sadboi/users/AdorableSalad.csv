I'm not a doctor, but not even a doctor could make an accurate judgment of someone based on so little. Do you think we would have to go through so much counseling if they could determine whether our dysphoria was valid or not this easily? 

With that said, if they have dysphoria and the only thing they can do to relieve it is to transition, then I don't really think it matters how or when they realized they had it, they're trans. 

How can you even determine whether someone has always been content with their sex or if they just have been unconsciously suppressing their dysphoria? Or whether someone developed dysphoria because of a fetish or that this fetish just made them realize they were dysphoric?"

”Effective bystander CPR provided immediately after sudden cardiac arrest can double or triple a victim's chance of survival, but only 32 percent of cardiac arrest victims get CPR from a bystander.”

Yesterday these two things collided when I pointed to a blue car and asked him what he thought about it. Without thinking he blurted ""oh it sure is very blue"" and then gave me this ""oh fuck"" look. He then made me promise to never tell my siblings about the situation.
