Reduction,fqw8jdf,t3_gl3wnn,1589695954.0,You're allowed to feel how you feel.  It doesn't mean you're a bad person if you want to change something about yourself.  Breast reductions especially. Having excess breast tissue is often painful and burdensome. That's extra weight! It also makes clothing uncomfortable. I've yet to have a shirt fit correctly.  So it's not wrong to feel the way you do. If someone is upset that you express your desire to change then they're selfish and rude.

Dealing with this makes me consider going braless. It is unrealistic to expect us in the cup sizes J on up to try and elevate around 10 lbs or more with flimsy straps. Perky is not relevant at this point. 

Either braless or we need better options. We're dealing with an idea that is for smaller sizes. It's definitely not working for my super big boobs ðŸ˜’."
depression,fhf0odp,t3_f2qwaw,1581533789.0,"This part is never easy. I don't even trust my brain these days. I've had to find a way to do things I love, like writing. Even my favorite hobbies are hard. Reading sucks because I have to reread sentences and passages. 

I didn't give up. I'm no where at the point where everything's okay, but I have noticed improvements. And I do enough to get by. 

In my case, what is helping is writing things down and focusing on things one at a time. Also admitting I'm prone to these holes in my memory and recall. (I forgot words to use in this one sentence.)

I still want to write for a living but because of these shortcomings, I've had to relearn basic things. Also, I'm training my brain to focus. 

Research ways to improve memory. After therapy and meds failed me, I started looking for ways to help myself. Self help books and therapy tools are available online. Try out things that will work for you."

The decision is yours how you want to handle it. Deep down you know what you want and need to do. Maybe counseling will help you both?

Maybe after surgery stay with a friend until you're well enough to care for yourself. That is a major surgery and you must have decent care afterwards. Plus while you're in that condition, you don't need the address stress."

I'd suggest talking to your sister. My sister and I don't get along, but communicating helps in certain instances. I think in your case, it can only help you prepare for the holiday events you'll attend.

If people say anything, you can easily stop them with a speech on body image. I found it's effective to make people aware of their rude behavior.

You also have the option to sit this holiday party season out. You deserve to be happy. Maybe that looks like staying home and watching holiday movies. Or you can spend it with a few close friends or family members who are in the know. You decide what's best for your well being. Having chronic pain and an autoimmune diseas are draining."

generalizedanxiety,f4wwfwl,t3_dm0yxm,1571860396.0,"These are the tips that come at the top of my head at the moment. That's mostly because I'm always dealing with them. This is based on the way the people in my life treat me. 

**Believe them.** Having generalized anxiety comes with a long list of symptoms. So if they are fatigued or tired, don't judge, especially to say that they are being lazy. 

**Understand that they are working on their issues every day**. For the longest, I couldn't get out of bed or leave my room. I'd be paralyzed with the thought of actually making decisions, thinking about what would go wrong and how I'm always messing things up. With GAD, it's a constant struggle with the inner self. (At least it is from my experience, and I'm guessing it's the same for others.) There will be good days when they're feeling functional and then bad days when they can't do anything at all. It doesn't mean they aren't giving their all. 

**Sharpen your communication skills**. Read articled about how to talk to people who have anxiety. You don't want to say something that sends them into a spin. I deal with this all the time. Wondering what's wrong with me. So don't say things or do things that will add pressure to a situation that's already overstuffed and ready to blow. 

**Read alone and read with your loved one**. Find helpful books. One that's in my pile is The 10 Best-Ever Anxiety Management Techniques. It's informative and actually helpful. Also, the internet has many articles and videos. Read from the perspective of those with Generalized Anxiety as well as the advice of professionals who actually deal with this daily. 

**Never be pushy**. Ever! One thing I'm constantly learning is how to be patient with myself. Dealing with someone else's timeline for their healing does not help. Again, unnecessary pressure. Be patient and know that they are trying even if it doesn't appear that way to you. 

**Show them you care**. This is very important. Sometimes I feel like I don't matter. Little gestures always cheer me up. Note, it's not a cure or a fix. It just makes the bad times that I'm experiencing at moments feel less bad. It doesn't have to be over the top. It could be watching a movie together or suggesting a little outing just to get out. Even the suggestion is helpful. It makes a person feel less alone, which is the goal. 

**Respect their need for space**. While you want to always be there, you should decide if your actions are self-serving or actually helpful. Read the cues and determine if they just want space. They know you're there. When they're ready, they will come to you on their terms. Every now and then, you can just say, ""I'm here for you."" But don't try to force it. 

I hope this helps. Again, based on my experience. I hope others join in to give some tips."
generalizedanxiety,f43hqqj,t3_dhzy06,1571341946.0,I know how that feels. It feels like you're not being listened to and that you aren't truly understood. I'm happy that you finally received a diagnosis.

On the plus side, you become extra observant. It comes in handy as far as a skill that can be applied in many professions."

The wires are poking my arms. The bottom is irritating to my chest like it's poking it. Like the area beneath the bra, not underneath it. It does appear to tilt forward.

The cup seems to cover everything but the straps are falling to the side. The bra is kinda slipping downwards as well."
