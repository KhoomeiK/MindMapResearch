When I drink white milk I get sick. (immediately after) I get a headache, stomachache, and I almost/sometimes throw up! This was a problem when I was younger, and then I stopped drinking milk for a while. Recently I've realized I needed more calcium, so I started drinking milk again, but I get sick! I don't know what's going on, because no one else in my family gets sick after drinking milk. (I'm fine with anything dairy related except milk) Do you think I have LI?

Thank you so much for your time!"
