AmItheAsshole,ey00hbc,t3_cusnpp,1566672688.0,"Sounds to me like your friend might have borderline personality disorder. People with BPD have no real sense of self, we don‚Äôt really know who we are, what our interests are and what makes us truly happy. We feel lost and empty most of the time and our personality depends on who we are with. If we like someone we try to be like that person, we pick up their mannerisms, their hobbies and interests and we almost copy them and mold ourselves into them becuase we have no idea who we are and we are just trying to fit in and feel like we belong becuase 90% we feel completely empty."

I have a hard time having a coherent conversation with someone when I‚Äôm stoned but I rarely open my mouth to talk to people anyways. I have only tried shrooms once and I didn‚Äôt feel much other than being relaxed meanwhile my 250lb boyfriend (I‚Äôm only 4‚Äô11 and 120lbs) ate the same amount as me and was tripping balls and he used to do shrooms all time. It blew his mind that it had almost no effect on me. I have only tried MDMA twice and the first time it just uplifted me a bit and the second time it didn‚Äôt do a thing.

I have noticed that as soon as get my feelings hurt in anyway I immediately turn that pain into anger but rarely act on it, occasionally I‚Äôll say something shitty or snotty but for the most part I hold it all in and let it slowly eat me alive. An example would be today at the grocery store with my bf and he stopped to tell me about how he had ‚Äúthe best French toast in the world the other day‚Äù. Now French toast if his favorite thing for me to make him, he always told me it was the best he had ever had and he always asked me to make it. As soon as he said that I felt crushed and in my head I thought, now my French toast is no longer his favorite, he hates my cooking, I can‚Äôt believe he would even eat someone else‚Äôs French toast. As quickly as his words crushed me and made me want to puke those feelings turned into anger. He saw in my face that I was upset and he said ‚ÄúI was just suggesting maybe you could try the type of bread they use next time you make it‚Äù and of course I had blurt out ‚Äú you can eat your fucking French toast at that place from now on‚Äù ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è   I immediately felt bad and reflected on what had just happened and I realized just how quickly having my feelings hurt turns into anger.

My kids are amazing and everyone always tells me how kind and respectful they are so I guess I can‚Äôt be doing a horrible job.

He was also an alcoholic and physically abusive to my older brothers and my mother but according to my brothers I was the ‚Äúspecial snowflake‚Äù child to my dad Because I was his biological child, I was a girl and he never beat me like he did them. While I couldn‚Äôt escape his emotional abuse he had only been physically abusive towards me a couple times while he was always hitting on my brothers, I hold a ton of guilt for that. I never understood why they always had it so bad and I didn‚Äôt, I felt like I deserved to beat too. Eventually I started acting out to get in trouble in hopes that he would beat me and punish me like he did my brothers, I almost felt left out if that makes sense. My brothers always hated me because I could get away with shit and do no wrong in my dads eyes when really I just acted out in hopes of getting the same treatment as my brothers. I wanted him to beat me, I wanted to be treated the same and I didn‚Äôt want my brothers to hate me, It‚Äôs fucked up!
