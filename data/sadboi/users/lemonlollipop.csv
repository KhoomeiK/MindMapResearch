Blush is/was generally meant to replicate the flush of color of youth or physical exertion, or the idealized version of it. Some people like strong blush, some like no blush, you're gonna have no end of creativity. 

Yeah the dark eyeshadow being so high up (in a non editorial look) is making it look like your brow is very heavy. It looks like you have a light shade on your lid, so if you keep that and move the dark shade down some millimetres then add a matte or satin (satin means has a little shine to it) cream colored shade under your brows then you'll have the appearance you're looking for

your blush would look better applied higher up on your cheeks and blended out with a fluffy brush, i like the real techniques blush brush. right now you've got a strong eye, strong cheek and strong lip and it will all balance with more blending


if the eyeshadow placement is a personal preference then feel free to ignore me, but i feel like the dark color would look better in your crease between your eyebrow and eyelid and, again, some more blending
