Anxiety,fqs16wt,t3_gkmtgk,1589596270.0,Just my opinion. It’s easy for anyone to say it’s anxiety but that should be the last diagnosis when ALL other tests clear. Please go to the hospital and get yourself checked before it’s something far worse than anxiety. I’m not a medical personnel but I know this because if have anxiety and depression and I got diagnosed this when everything else was ruled out.
