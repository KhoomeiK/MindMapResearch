Most people I've known who have been close to someone, in any kind of relationship, will get frustrated/annoyed with that person occasionally. Or sometimes a lot for a period of time depending on what is going on. And these are people who have generally healthy relationships.

Endo,fof74sa,t3_g6zdmw,1587728301.0,"I totally understand. While I've often been at least a little overweight, endo has played a significant role in gaining more weight. Even when it first started getting bad, I had believed so strongly in that diet and exercise will fix it, I kept trying and was puzzled as to why things kept getting worse for years.


Plus I ended up in so much pain cooking was often hard to do, and exercise. Getting enough exercise has always made a major difference in how much I weigh, more so than what I eat. Though of course a lot of foods causing more pain upon eating (pretty strong evidence for bowel endo), meant messing it up even more. 


I do try to eat more of certain foods when I can, depending on when I can make them, since they will be easier to digest or anti inflammatory/help with nausea, and it will help a little sometimes, but it's just a tool, not a cure or total fix. 

I was on Orilissa for 6 months and it did help a lot during that time, including with my weight, I was able to cook more and move around a lot more than I had been able to in years. After I went on it, my symptoms got worse than ever, couldn't move much some months, and weight quickly came on. 
It'll often feel like I'm irritating adhesions/nerves that have been affected by endo with movement when it's worse, too. Then I can have a flare up and be stuck in bed for the most part for days. 


I passed the point of tylenol and nsaids helping enough years ago, when I first went to Urgent care for this, they gave me that hand out and I laughed at it. Why would I got to UC unless that had stopped working?"

Adding fat to a meal will slow down the digestion/absorption of carbohydrates and it does help stabilize your blood sugar (so does fiber and protein).

Vegetables and leafy greens are generally healthier than eating a lot of fruit (plus some meat, grains, seeds & nuts, legumes, etc, depending on your body and what works for it).

I've used dilaters (not cones, though, WTF are those, sounds terrifying), and they are a \*lot\* of work. I have several chronic health problems that causes me pain in that area, and none of them are going away. The combination is draining, and it really doesn't tend to put one in a sexual mood.   


I was actually bothered by you saying that it's not your responsibility, because while I agree she has to be the one to put in the initial effect, you could help her use the cones, or at least offer. Conditions like these are very mentally isolating and having a partner who is invested in your comfort and willing to put actual work into it, goes a long way. I'm sure you don't mean it to come off this way, but from what I read, I do think she likely feels alone in this. It may even be making her feel less valued and desired. 

&#x200B;

I'd be careful going down the path of ""it's all mental"". Yeah, trauma does cause these problems for some women, but a lot of times, it's physical. Doesn't mean that being relaxed won't sometimes help even physical problems, but it doesn't always. If you aren't able to/willing to help her with the cones, perhaps she could see a pelvic floor therapist who is? 

&#x200B;

Obviously her struggling doesn't invalidate you feeling unwanted or not desired, and you need to talk to her about it more how it makes you feel, but I think wrapping it up into ""I have to have this one thing and there is no other way to fulfill my needs"", does put a lot of pressure on a person, which is not very sexy and can turn someone off sex. Sure, it's understandable to have that need. It's human. It's just not very flexible. There should be more of a focus on what else can happen that would make you feel the connection you want. She could be wanting to do oral to ""shut you up"", or it could be to try to make you feel desired in a different way. Only way to know is to ask her."

You do need to spend the $2,250 within 9 months, then they will send you another $2,250 after 6 months which you have 9 months to spend. Then the rest of it.

Most people thinking paying your credit card bill on time is enough. It isn't, in fact I've had my credit get dinged for not following the below, even with no late payments or fees. 

Make sure your statement balance ends up being less than 30% of whatever your credit limit is. Let's say you have a card with a $300 limit, you'd want to make sure it was under $90 by the time your billing cycle ends. You want to make sure to pay at least 3 business days before that day so that your payment has enough time to process. 

What you do the next month is also very important. You don't want any of your cards to read at 0% use and I'll tell you why. It's because if next month, you have anything on it by your billing cycle, it'll read as you having a higher overall balance and it'll bring your credit down again, even if it's under 30%. 

You want to pay what you can afford to this month, keeping in mind that next month you want to try to knock off at least another 5% off that amount. 
So let's say you have a $300 card, and you leave an $85 balance on it. 
Then you have a $500 card, and you leave $130 on it. 
You pay all of that off next month before it is due so there are no fees, and then you can use your card again, just make sure each balance is at least slightly lower than next month.

If you think you will be able to keep a consistent balance or keep lowering that final balance, then it's fine to lower it more the second month, or have one card be 0%. 
I just recommend it this way due to how if you have an unexpected expense, forget to pay it down lower in time, etc, it won't ding your credit by having a higher balance the next month. Especially with how the coronavirus is affecting the economy."

AskWomen,fl36mgx,t1_fl31h2y,1584770670.0,"I relate so much! And there is mental loads to other things, it's all dependant on the woman and what her life is like but some extra examples are, clothing, make-up, hair, accessories.

I often was crying and panicking trying to get ready to go somewhere because there is always so many related steps to it, and it just never ends. I have some chronic illnesses which add yet *more* steps and by the time I walk out the door, I'm usually a wreck. 

Ironically, I think this may be part of why I like porches so much. You get to ""get away"" from that stuff but you don't have to do a whole lot, just step outside your door. And probably also why I don't like open concepts for houses, I like the older houses that have lots of doors and divide living spaces up, it helps compartmentalize the mental load a little bit."

Thanks."
endometriosis,fkwpq1y,t3_fl2su5,1584600674.0,"I've been having mixed feelings.

On one hand, I am worried as I was going to try to get surgery this year, now that may not be possible and I'm worried about the rate the endo seems to be growing. 

On the other, I had been really struggling to make medical appointments, crying, breaking down in a panic, almost not going due to how bad I've been feeling. I've not been able to keep up on housework where it's really, really bad, most of my energy went to said appointments.

I had been wishing for telehealth services and find it really ironic I'll be getting them for a while now, but it took a pandemic. It does show that if the government wants to do something like this, it can. Which is frustrating."
CPTSD,fkwp28f,t3_fks7zv,1584599946.0,"I'll post another comment about the mental health part, but wanted to say, for the practical reality, that they are making it so you can't be evicted right now if you can't pay rent. 
Also considering sending $1,000 checks to taxpayers. Yes, it's still going to be hard money wise but I wanted to tell you in case it relieves some of the pressure."

I wonder if this is recent, or could it have been going on for a long time? I ended up returning a few bags of frozen winco blackberries about 12 days ago, I had bought them last month and found them to be bad quality, tried eating a few, couldn't stomach it."

Eugene,fkr2jet,t3_fjvwwp,1584460582.0,"It is really expensive here, and $1,200 for a one bedroom is starting to become the new norm, but it's not impossible to find a one or two bedroom for $950 or under. In fact, sometimes a one bedroom is the same price as a two bedroom.
You can PM me for the places I'm talking about, I look often."

Endo,fkjsg4g,t3_fiuqhk,1584257584.0,"Yes, you can. I am not sure where that link is now, but I remember reading a case of a woman who had endo affect the nerves in that area and she ended up with pain like that. For anecdotal evidence, my mom also did, I suspect some was from endo. Later on I started getting some pain that felt endo related in my leg/hip/lower back. I also have a connective tissue disorder that causes pain there, but this felt different, and flared with the rest of my endo symptoms."
Endo,fkjsbj4,t3_fiq6hj,1584257418.0,"Shame is a big part of having endo for me, too. How it breaks me down and prevents me from doing what I want and need to do, in both big and small ways. It holds me back so much. I end up beating myself up for not being able to function as well as I need to, and the way I used to before this happened, and before it progressed to even more pain."

dating_advice,fjvwfhg,t1_fjrforn,1583631777.0,"That is more normal, though, for either gender. It's one thing to flake on someone for a few days after a few weeks of talking, while figuring out what direction you want to go in, then making up your mind after that and sticking to it. Can still be hurtful, but is a way different animal from people who go back and forth between people giving them all sorts of excuses playing them."
BPD,fjm5z8d,t1_fjkyzvb,1583462397.0,"Yeah, you gotta be careful with this, the way I had been treated by my former therapist lead me to doubt when I was seeing red flags..they contributed to me doubting myself in an abusive situation until I was in pretty deep. Took me a long time to get out of that one. Yes, one can get triggered and have fight or flight going on and not see a person clearly, but once one has calmed down, it's important to not dismiss toxic behavior."
