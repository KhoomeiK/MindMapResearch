depression,fqa5ov2,t3_ghdi7l,1589213276.0,"I find that depressed people tend to be more empthatic towards other people and how shitty the world is in general. They not only overthink things about themself but overthink about just everything because theyre super empathetic. The people that ive talked to that dont have depression dont ever think about that stuff constantly. It may seem kinda mean but they are very like...shallow minded? Idk..they dont think about things or linger on things for long. Like theyre more prone to do things, say things, for the sake of themselves and not care about how they affect others. If theres a problem they just either try to fix and if they cant fix it.. they forget about it. Like i was talking to 2 people and we were talking about concerns of how future generations are gonna be affected by social media/ the internet...1 person totally was on the same wave legnth as me and we were like lowkey depressed about it...and the other person you could tell that it was something that never crossed his mind ever and he had the mentality of like ""you cant do anything about it so just forget it"". Which is something i cant understand.

I honestly still dont get how there's people that arent depressed....but thats the only insight i have to understanding these bizarre creatures."

Asexual,fq0cia8,t3_gg4w4x,1589030021.0,"I think it would be a good point to bring up for sure. I think what would REALLY help is more asexual representation in pop culture. Like Todd from Bojack Horseman is the only one I can think of. I find that young people tend to learn a lot from what they watch...so even if there was a teacher explaining it wouldnt be as impactful as an actual character or person explaining their real life experience. Like i think people were scared or didnt understand gays or lesbians until they got more representation and started telling their stories. 

Like for a teacher who is not asexual it would be extremely hard to differentiate and explain to kids libido, celibacy until marriage, and asexuality. This is all just my personal opinion tho."
depression,fpgphrj,t3_gdd4vm,1588607152.0,"When my best friend moved i was devastated. It broke me but i dont think it broke her as much. Ive been friends with her 8 years after she moved and now even though we don't talk/see each other as often as we use to. The one thing id suggest is to keep in touch digitally; text memes to each other, ask each other hows life. The one thing i realized at the time even though its kinda dark...no matter what wouldve happened...life wouldve eventually changed over time and your friendship wouldnt have stayed the way it is forever. Like if you were friends in middle school, realistically, do you think that would stay the same 5, 10, 20 years later? So if you guys can adapt and be there for each other despite being far apart and if its small itll show how strong your friendship is"

asexualdating,fp4jo2g,t1_fp3gjta,1588300520.0,"Ahhh ok. Well first lemme say if he doesnt want to have sex with you often dont take it personally. If hes actually asexual him not wanting sex isnt because youre not good enough or something, its literally cause he just doesnt have that drive all the time

But who knows maybe hes dealing with something internally? Cause if hes feeling down about something that could affect his libido...OR he could actually be trying to figure out if hes asexual or not. Idk. I think that if anything you have to be patient, understanding, and LISTEN to him cause im sure hes trying to figure out stuff too if he only came out recently. 

Im sure its super frusterating on your part cause you know what you want and what the issue is, but i think for him hes either telling you the truth or hes figuring things out and either way he doesnt really have anything to say.

So ya you either have to be patient, understanding, and find some kind of compensation, or  if its affecting you that much you might have to leave"
asexualdating,fo9l0fh,t3_g2bbfo,1587622620.0,"So this is just my opinion, but if he's asexual you may have to just accept his boundries? Or accept he doesnt like having sex as often as you. Obviously talk it through and see what hes open to but if he has clearly indicated he's not really into sex from the beginning and then you were ok with online...but now irl its not ok.. you may just have to either adjust your expectations or if you feel like its damaging your relationship ,leave. Again talk it through with him to see options but I just dont think its fair to him to be honest about being asexual, then having to change that to please you now that you've met irl. Again this is just my personal opinion."

venting,fmarjyn,t3_fu4ty3,1585904976.0,"I get that. Its annoying how making everything a meme is the norm. Like it annoys me that people make a meme out of mental health too. People could be sitting at a camp fire toasting a marshmallow and be like ""ok but liek why is that marshmallow LITERALLY ME"". Why is it so easy to do and why is there no meaningfulness or why doesnt it ever bring up an interesting conversation?

I feel like its just a trend and a sign of the times....people just wanna fit in and be a part of something instead of being alone. Maybe another trend will come soon and this will go away or maybe we'll get old enough to not care. I guess find comfort in the fact that other people find it annoying too?"
Asexual,fmar6hm,t3_fu3b41,1585904554.0,"I hate to play devils advocate but like...i kinda get where theyre coming from? Some people facing incredible depression can cause them to have a low libido, compared to if they weren't depressed they would want to have sex more often. Or even taking medication there can be a side effect of having a low libido

Low libido doesnt mean that youre automatically asexual...but i totally get how as an asexual thats invalidating and demoralizing cause other sexual orientations dont have to be ""checked"". And the trouble of having to explain thats just who we are its just troublesome. 

I just think normal people cant understand or decipher the difference between being asexual and having a low sex drive. So i guess we have to educate them on that a bit more on that"

relationship_advice,fibcke1,t3_f7dfg1,1582319127.0,"I think that your wife needs encouragement to do more outside stuff. Like im sure her doing the same house chores and cooking for you was good at first but maybe shes getting bored? Thats not really your fault but it just kinda happens and she might feel a bit lost at the moment. Telling her friends and indirectly like resenting you a bit?. Like she might feel like staying at home is more of an obligation now than something that she was ok with doing before , hence the 1950s comment. I think her friends are saying fears or concerns that shes too afraid to say even though its overdramatisized. 

Again i think you need to encourage your wife to pursue her hobbies and potentionally turn those hobbies into a business since i guess she feels stuck in a routine? She might be scared to to change things cause of her anxiety and stuff so encouraging her she has more control over the situation than she thinks...idk. Again its not really your problem, but trying to help her figure out what she wants to do and what she can do by herself instead of relying on you for everything might help her"

BoJackHorseman,fg4oblg,t3_ewl6yl,1580507492.0,"I love how it ended honestly. I like how the ending is a bit open ended and up for interpretation, it means that the series impacted and meant a lot to people. Its still got those sad vibes of how you constantly drift through life with uncertainty but the tone at the end where you gotta just live life day by day, try to constantly improve, and have faith that you deserve good things. Idk i feel likes its important. Its a bitter sweet ending and I like it. I think also depending where you are in life it might speak to you differently. So i thoroughly enjoy it but thats just me

He's really helpful when I'm feeling depressed but when I'm feeling happy he brings me down.

I don't think you can blame those people cause they don't even know how to be happy for them self, so you have to find people that can be encouraging. That's what I'm trying to do. It's hard, but just know you deserve people who want the best for you. And you're actively working on yourself so that proves you are better and deserve better"
