I asked a doctor about it once and they said it was probably my immune system overreacting. I have a family history of Hashimoto’s, diabetes, pernicious anemia, ITP, etc. About 9 months before my Addison’s symptoms hit me, I got a positive ANA test.

Chest pain can be mistaken for heartburn often. I would get a check up with a cardiologist ASAP to make sure nothing weird is going on.

My blood pressure was at 63/30 during my 2nd crisis, which got me diagnosed, and it kept dropping steadily. I was given IV hydrocortisone but it wasn’t really enough to raise it and they put me on epinephrine and I ended up in ICU for a week. Epinephrine can be used in crisis along with hydrocortisone, I’ve since learned. When my BP stayed in the 80/60 range for a day, they moved me to the progressive care unit. I was able to go home on the 7th day when my BP finally stayed at around 95/65. My normal BP before Addison’s was always 95-100/60-65 so this was fine for me but might be low for others. 

Stomach pain is also just a common symptom of an crisis. Make sure you have at least two emergency injections on you *at all times*, if you do not. Vomiting more than once is time to inject and then head to a hospital.

Make sure she has an emergency kit with solu-cortef injections. I also keep Zofran in mine for vomiting, and anti-diarrheal medicines. I have electrolyte drink mix in there too.

She should have her own blood pressure monitor for home use, to monitor her BP in case she ever feels ill. And, of course, she absolutely must have a medical bracelet on at all times.

These are things she should always have on hand, coronavirus or not.

I also have an extremely rare disease called Addison’s disease that makes literally any illness a life or death situation. Am I worried? Of course. I actually have a good reason to worry. Does that mean I need to panic though? No. Because I’ve done all I can and I’m prepared as much as one can be. There’s a difference between worrying and losing your mind for no reason. I know that if I’m worried I shouldn’t be looking at coronavirus related things. If you’re going to shut down any advice given to you then I don’t know why you made this thread. That level of worry is for a professional.

You get to pick. Nobody can help you if you want to discount all logic and sound advice. 

It is possible to use the internet and avoid coronavirus news. I do it all the time. Don’t visit the news and don’t browse coronavirus subs."
COVID19_support,fjeew3f,t1_fjeetcq,1583270624.0,"It’s not everywhere. It’s on the internet and that’s avoidable. 

There’s nothing you can do about your parents either. You have even less control over other people."
Breadit,fje9c3g,t3_fcwubz,1583267551.0,I’m gonna need a recipe for that beautiful bread.
COVID19_support,fje8zop,t3_fcg5gp,1583267358.0,"Therapy. Yesterday. 

There’s literally nothing you can do. You’re not in a high risk group and you don’t need to be irrational. I’m 28 and have a very rare disease that means any illness can kill me. I can’t go around losing my mind anytime a virus is making its rounds. Go about your life and stay off the internet/news if you can’t get therapy."
COVID19_support,fje8s6n,t3_fd099q,1583267242.0,"Get off the internet and stop looking at the news, for starters. That’s just feeding your anxiety loop.

There’s literally nothing you can do about this. And you’re not in a high-risk group. People that are dying are mostly all 50+/have health conditions. You are not the people who need to be afraid. Take control over your fear by staying as hygienic as possible and stay away from crowds/the general public. You’ll be fine."
nutrition,fje2kj1,t3_fctx4m,1583263995.0,This isn't a problem if you're cooking your own food and not relying on processed stuff.
EatCheapAndHealthy,fjdz1k5,t3_fc8u4l,1583262003.0,"You're making this way too complicated. You don't need to overthink any of this. It's very simple. 

I'd stop worrying about fruit, first of all. It's called nature's candy for a reason. It should be treated as such. It is sugar with some fiber and vitamins/minerals but there is nothing in fruit that you can't get from vegetables in higher amounts without the sugar. That includes vitamin c and potassium. 

Grab your protein of choice. Cook it how you like it. Then get your veg of choice. Cook it how you like it. Add complex carbohydrate, if desired. It's very simple. This is what I do weekly and use it for lunches/dinners. Buy frozen veg so it doesn't go bad. Frozen veg is picked when truly ripe and doesn't sit around on a shelf going to hell so it's typically better for you. 

For instance: I roast chicken thighs/chicken breasts/whatever with garlic/herbs. Then I roast a sheet pan full of broccoli/carrots. Cook a pot of quinoa. Boom this is lunch/dinner for a few days. Sub in whatever meat/veg/carb."
EatCheapAndHealthy,fjdyikp,t3_fcz02j,1583261709.0,"If you're cooking it yourself from scratch and not adding sugar, yes."
AddisonsDisease,fjdv7os,t1_fjdux5x,1583259901.0,"Nooo! Ugh. Sorry you're sick! Hopefully it passes quickly. I cannot believe I've avoided getting a cold/anything so far. Everyone around me seems to be conspiring to get me sick. And of course coronavirus news is a joy to read about. I just got extra refills on my meds/emergency injections due to paranoia, lol."
Cakes,fjduwfp,t3_fbvmkm,1583259727.0,I've never seen a cake like that! Very cool.
