On the way in we walked past some other hikers and said our hellos and we were much more at ease because we knew we wouldn't be alone in the woods all night.

The night was terrifying. The weather changed abruptly and it was freezing cold. The wind was so loud and we thought every single sound was a bear, but knowing that the other group was only a mile or so down the trail made us feel so much better.

We woke up and packed our gear at the crack of dawn, and when we got back to where we had seen the other group, there was nothing there. There wasn't any sign that they had set up their tents.

We had been alone all night.
