DnD,eydbk09,t3_cwmxg7,1567015421.0,"I'm also DMing for the first time and doing a seafaring campaign! I decided to be extra and homebrew the whole thing right from the start. It centers around an exploration based expedition to otherwise unexplored islands. 

I took a lot of (sometimes direct) inspiration for different big plot points and themes from seafaring novels and the like. A rich duchess acquires an ancient chart to an island chain beyond the known ocean and wants to explore, so she funds a grand expedition consisting of a flotilla of sailing ships, hired adventurers, scientists and crew. There's a main ""HQ"" ship that's decked out with all the protection and magic money can buy (which works as the character's headquarters where they go back for rest, relaxation and supplies), two warships for the protection of the HQ ship, and several smaller scouting ships that are meant to sail ahead of the HQ/warships and send word back to follow if the route is safe.

The party is on one of these scouting ships. My players decided they'd rather not be the ship's crew, so they are just hired adventurers who are stationed on this particular ship, though several of them are planning to play experienced sailors. 

The islands nearest the mainland are inhabited and known, but even they don't know what is beyond. Each island is fairly unique with some secret or magical oddity on it. There are also fish people and merfolk that live in the waters, with plans for at least one fully underwater session based around merfolk (because I love mermaids <3). Later they'll discover the goddess who created and dwells in the islands, which I'm trying to tie together with a cleric in the party. 

Like I said, it's my first time DMing, so my ideas and notes are all over the place, but if you want more details I don't mind sharing what I have set up so far. :)"
