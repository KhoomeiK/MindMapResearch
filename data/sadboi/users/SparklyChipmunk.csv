One last thought regarding the mention of taboo. Sometimes people will fail to consider path which are unknown to them. So some therapists/psychiatrists might unknowingly incorrctly diagnose someone as depressive/bipolar simplily because that's what they know best, thats the majority, and they never actually stop to consider alternatives. Some might (again unconsciously) think that ""oh but if it's something I don't have experience in, I wont be able to help so i'd have to refer them somewhere else"". I dunno how to explain it better, but we need to remember drs are human, they have their egos and they sometimes make mistakes. It's sad and unfair to those misdiagnosed, but it happens"

My best advice is: arm yourself with patience and learn to look at things from different perspectives (it will help you filter out the BPD from real emtions/reactions). Remind yourself that you deserve good things, but also that you may sometimes be mistaken. And learn to remove unsupportive/toxic people from your life. Im not saying to distance completely from them, but don't rely on their feedback/opinions as much. Find those who wish you good and want to trully help you and be there for you (even if they sometimes tell you things you dont wanna hear, but deep down know they are right... hope you know what i mean).

However, once I did I started researching on it and then had that moment of light clicking on. All my past behaviours, emotions, thoughts sort of made sense and had an explanation. It also helped me to identify it as the cause and understand myself better and what i need to work on.

Mindfulness,fn9jukc,t3_g0glm0,1586775752.0,"Here is an exercise i learned from my therapist, which helps me fall asleep when i can't. It's actually used as for of hypnosis when doing guided therapy. Idea is to lay in bed, close your eyes and slowly relax your body. Start with the head, the forhead and move downwards going through groups of muscles, actively thinking they relax (i.e. mentally say to yourself ""my forehead is relaxed... my nose is relaxed, my cheeks are relaxed"" and relax each of them as you do). Then move to your neck, shoulders, upper left arm, lower left arm, fingers, same on the right side, chest, abdomen, so on. If you went through the whole body and are still awake, do the same but thinking ""my .... is warm, i am embracing the relaxing feling of warmth"". Usually by the time you finish gowing twice through your whole body, you should be asleep. 

This should help keep your mind from wondering towards negative/anxious thoughts and relax you enough to sleep. If the mind does wonder, don't get upset. Let the thought come, imagine placing it into a ""to deal with tomorrow"" box, and return to thinking about relaxing your body.

I hope this helps you. Sleep well

I don't really remember much about my life before my age, so i cannot say. Where im going with this is: personally, i probably displayed symptoms waaaay earlier than i am aware of.

Im not saying she has to be ugly, im just saying look for character compatibilities first. And dont compare yourself (or the girls you'll date) with ur friends (or their gfs). You dont know what they been through or what their lives are like. They could portray perfection out of some deep fears of not firting in or rejection.

vaginismus,fn65lmm,t1_fn5n1bd,1586688331.0,"Because its's normal and biological to get turned on and want sex. The past trauma explains why you reject things going in and the bad feeling. But it's normal to feel the physical pleasure/crave (similar to how some women orgasm when raped). It happens, and sometimes the physical doesn't alight with the mental.

As for thinking that you'll never find someone.. bit of back story: been abused as a kid and then from 16 to 19 been in two emotionally abusive relationships (1.5 and 2yrs). I didn't have sex with either of them because i couldnt. Then until 26-27 i didnt start another realtionship because i was thinking no onr wants me without me giving them sex. When i was almost 27 i found my current partner and he is so damn patient I've never seen smth alike. We didnt atempt anything in the first year of our relationship and then we tried but it was nothing but failures so we kinda honestly gave up after a while because of the pain and the frustrations. He wants it. I want it. Im just not there yet, and her hugs me and tells me its fine we'll. Im new here, trying again, just got my first ever dilator set, so we will try again after. What im trying to say is there are people willing to wait, you just need to fidn those who truly care about you. Thats why i suggested finding a therapist. They might help you work through the confusion and help you get to a more peaceful place mentally. Sorry if it sounds like im overstepping.

I encourage you to try and see a therapist, they work wonders sometimes and I believe you deserve you get over this trauma and heal yourself.

Secondly, sorry if im completely wrong, but i dont things you're going the right way about this. Saying that you accepted you'll never be in a loving relationship, but just maybe tryto feel good through casual sex. I think you can absolutelly be in a loving relationship just need to be open to that and careful about finding the right guy. More saw, when i was reading that part the first thing that came to mind was, you'll probably be able to create that connection by not focusing on sex first. Basically, if you find someone who doesn't want just sex from the first date and is willing to wait, they will have the patience and care to help you through the issues and get to a point where sex comes out of love (not just a form of validation or violence) and it could be easier. Im not a therapist, but i honestly encourage you to just try and remove the idea of sex out of focus for a while and try to connect with people in other ways. This could help you see yourself a not being just 'used goods', and you'll be more than your vagina. You do deserve better, and you do deserve to feel good. But you might need to connect with someone emotionally,make them see all of you and who you are, before you'll be able to feel good sexually. I hope this makes sense. Again, not saying it's what you must do, just magbe it's a path you can consider exploring. Forcing yourself to feel good with casual sex now, could lead you to despise sex and yourself from that perspective even more (talking from experience).

And for feeling good woth sex, try masturbating (with or without toys), make it about yourself feeling good and no one else. This could give you some sense of control and consent which can help you through it. Wishing you good luck and hoping you'll be happy ❤ take care (sorry for the huuuuge comment)"

To answer your question about change in routine, it's a mix of yes and no. As in, I start noticing this a while back. Then, my routine was the same so obviously, I assumed make my skin just got ""bored"" of the same products so it would be a good idea to find alternatives. I tried some (for face creams, primers, foundations) but same shitty result. I went back to products I could swear by in the past, same results. I went to a dermatologist to recommended stuff, same thing. So I tried options, and it happens with both sticking to the same routine, and changing things.

As for it being it my head... maybe, who knows. I know that a very likely possibility, but at the same time it is something I'm  aware of and wouldve been able to identify. And it happens even when I'm in a good mood... in my mind or not, I'm seeing that damn foundation just sitting on my skin instead of getting blended in properly. If it in my mind, then the issue is with my eyes too XD

As for being playful, I feel like that has its downsides for me sometimes... and at the same time, I'm ashamed to do that since I'm living with my bf and feel like he would judge me. To be honest, my relationship is part of the reason why my makeup is shit lately. And not because of him, more because of my fear of how he would judge me. In my mind, I cant risk playing around with makeup and risk looking ridiculous if he's home and can see me.

The problem with it is that most people do it in a burst of negative emotions, or in a state of mind where they aren't at their full capacities (eg. Teenagers who are not mature enough to realize that HS issues end at one point and things get better). That aside, many of those who attempted and didn't die report regretting it the second they did it. So it just sort of comes down to the fact that it's an irreversible act which most people dont really fully understand until it's too late. But I wouldnt see a dying cancer patient who wants to end their suffering as wrong. (And to those who would argue depression is also a disease killing you slowly, yes I understand, but depression doesnt actively eat at your physical body. There is a chance to come back from that, small as it may be. I've been there.)

That said, there is the religious aspect of some beliefs out there who consider it a sin and just wrong, no matter what circumstances it involves. I dont understand or relate to that perspective to be honest. Those were my 3 cents on the topic.

Parents need to teach kids self awareness, management skills and how to be productive in the society. Not just limit them and expect they will apply the same sht afterwards.

TrueOffMyChest,fl4nz8f,t3_fmjxm7,1584817607.0,"My advice, whether it is or it isn't your mother's fault, don't let that become your excuse and stop you from losing weight yourself. You dont need fancy paid for programs to exercise, fine something online that works for you and do it in your home. Or start jogging. What I'm saying is there are alternatives. As for eating out, you can try to pick healthier options from those places or talk to your mom to try going somewhere else. 

Sry for being so straightforward, but you'll learn in life that only you are truly in control and can change your life. If your mom wouldve been the opposite, noticed the weight change and started forcing you to exercise, you couldve just as easily started hating her for calling you fat and affecting your confidence. What I'm saying is that you're the only one who can choose what's best for you (within the limits of common sense and being healthy ofc) and work towards achieving that; no one will be able to do it for you or force you to. But please be safe and healthy. You're still growing and developing so weight changes will happen. Dont let that affect how you think of urself or define you."
TrueOffMyChest,fl0fz7k,t3_flthrt,1584705119.0,"Okay, here's my feedback: as long as you keep doing your job, they have no right to enforce this on you. If there was an assumption that you are slacking off and sht, maybe I'd say that have a reason. But since you mention you keep doing your work, I really cannot agree with them.

I'm shy and hate seeing my face on video. I've been working remotely for the past years, recently started an office job(but still have frequent calls because the teams are not local) and now we're back to full time remote. During all this time, no one who doesnt want to start video is force to do it. Even our boss protected this choice a few times when clients requested it. We only ask people to do it in interviews, so the boss can put a face behind the name. 

That said, I would enforce this option to choose even more so when the employee it working from home. If I'm at the office and you ask me to start video, then fine whatever. But my home is my private space and I dont want you seeing my surroundings. These are my two cents, call me paranoid or extreme, but fuck employers who force unnecessary shit onto people :)))"

My ""BFF"" even told me that my bf stays with me for nothing if I dont have sex with him. Luckily he really is an amazing guy with an insane amount of patience. But in fully honesty, it also frustrates me because maybe I also wanna just come home after a crazy day at work and unwind like that... but it's not an option...

BPD,fkwoy4e,t3_fl58v6,1584599821.0,"In my case, I didnt know about a FP until i joined this sub, then looked into it a bit more an discussed it with my therapist. Looking back,I've had a few FPs,most of which were either my partner or BFF. Currently, my FP is my partner... 

The differences between the FP and other friends, at least for me:
- I feel a much stronger relationship and connection to them
- I have a tendency to idealise them and, when they do smth I perceive as ""wrong"", I split on them
- I get jealous if they want to spend time with others and have this thinking of ""I'm happy and satisfied with just having you in my life, why cant I be enough for you""
- they give me this feeling of as long as they are with me, I can go through sht more easily

The way I realise someone has become my FP is because they start ticking items on the list above. But as I said, just found out last year about this, and I was already with my bf so for me it was mostly adding context over past and current FPs. I didnt go through the experience of someone becoming my FP and me noticing it as it happened

If I think of other, I'll add later. Hope it helps give you an idea"
BPD,fkwj97d,t3_fl3rzp,1584594179.0,"YES and thank you for existing and making me feel like less of an oddity. I am struggling to have a normal and constant sex life with my bf (issues due to past experiences and pain during contact). But I have to admit there is a high lack of interest/desire on my side, I'm just not in the mood most of the time and cannot get turned on. And this is mostly due to the self hate which just takes me to a really bad place whenever we try to initiate smth

And all I hear around is how BPD makes you promiscuous and sex obsessed, and it's like hearing there is this magical tool you could be using for validation (sex), I would have the safe circumstances of practicing it (with my bf) and yet I cannot because pain and horrible self hate. So fk me, I guess I'll just continue being a ""useless woman"" (this is how I'm seeing myself now because of this... like I'm failing at the most basic thing we can do)

You did consent, but you weren't in the position to do so  in my opinion. At 13 yo you are not mentaly developed enough to give proper, fully informed consent. That aside, your consent was also half ""coerced"" due to your fears of him leaving you and the other issues in your relationship. So considering all this, I wouldnt say you gave consent. He didn't force himself onto you either, but he also was at an age of fked up hormones and not heing able to understand you weren't able to consed and this could affect you.

I've seen people visit to perform such ""inspections"" or discussing afterwards with others about things like ""when I visited my son, the house was not sparkly clean or his gf/wife didnt serve me with X Y Z"". As if it's just her job, he isnt living in the same house. On the other side,for the woman's side of the family there's life this weird relief of ""oh she finally found someone, let's not scare him away""... regardless of how much of an a-hole he is. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Again not happing everytime, but it's been what I noticed in my extended family and their acquaintances."

Dont expect to go 3 weeks without brushing, then do it one day for 5 times cause you have a date and expect shit to work out on the long run.

TrueOffMyChest,fhokqwz,t3_f47j32,1581762020.0,"I agree with you, but here is also another POV (sort of supports the same idea):

My parents grew up in a comunist country, at the country side where animals had jobs, they weren't pets (cat catches rats, dog guards the household). They didn't hate animals, just didn't see the point in having them in an apartment. When I was younger, i desperately wanted a pet but they were against it. When I was around 12,I found an abandoned kitten and brought her home. She was so frail and sick that my mom reassured my dad that she would die in a week and no more problems. Little did they both know we ended up having her for 13 years in which they got to know her personality, and know what a cat truly is and genuinelly fall in love with her. When we had to put her to sleep (she was very sick), my mom was crying alongside me and dad was also affected. Now they both love cats, I have another lil floofer and they adopted themselves around 4 strays.

While having her, my mom also decided to get me a dog since I wanted one. Same thing with dad, what would a dog do in this house, we don't need it blah blah blah... when my lil boy got to us and dad spent some time with him, they became best friends and my dad was insisting on being the one talking him on walks in the evenings. Now he lives with them, at their new home in the country side (huge yard happy boyo) and my dad brags more with the dog, than with me. 

Whenever I see those posts,I tend to believe those dads/parents simply hadn't had the chance to know a pet before and once they do they actually enjoy their presence. Sorry for the long story XD"
