vancouver,flof4ew,t3_fq2tcx,1585337094.0,"I have been one of the very vocal skeptics in this sub re: the province's response to COVID-19. Just want to say that it's great to hear this!!! I still don't think we're in the thick of it by any means, and I still believe it will overwhelm the capacity of our healthcare system. That being said, this is better than nothing. Don't stop being vigilant though - wash your hands, dont touch face, and stay the heck home! We still need to see what the next 1-2 weeks bring, and that has me worried..."
TalkTherapy,flo1dwd,t3_fpyfwd,1585329826.0,"Well if it makes you feel any better, T's actually enjoy and like hearing from people who think they are a ""burden, or selfish a-hole,"" - which btw I don't think is true at all.  I know it might feel counter-intuitive to you, but therapists \*want\* to know more about how people are doing and coping, and want to help disrupt beliefs that keep people stuck because it gives \*them\* meaning and contentment in life. 

All of us are going through a hard time, and that's why we all need to talk to someone. Hell, your therapist probably has a therapist who has a therapist who has a therapist. Everyone deserves to be supported in this time. Health care workers, therapists, moms, dads, drug addicts, those of us struggling with mental illness, children, housekeepers....literally all of us need to lean on one another. You are not exempt from that.

PS: you actually don't know if your T is depressed. It might jsut be that the experience is different over the phone, and you are interpreting it that way. Please bring your struggles up with your T because it is so so so important that you get support, whether you feel deserving of it or not."
OpiatesRecovery,flnnsle,t1_fln86l2,1585322419.0,"For good reason, mate. CPS is keeping a lot of kids and families safe throughout this. It would be negligent to ignore children facing violence during a crisis."
OpiatesRecovery,flnnl0a,t3_fpv6i1,1585322299.0,"You should be able to still get on suboxone from somewhere - are the clinics where you live seriously all shut down? Where i live, we‚Äôre fully expecting people who use drugs to switch onto suboxone/methadose/other safe supply drugs, and clinics are working remotely or in-person to make that happen.

On another note, try to separate what specifically your anxiety is about - COVID-19, withdrawal, and/or child apprehension. They are all different things. You can get thru the withdrawal and wont die if you are doing opiates even if it feels like it. You should still be able to have phone contact with your child (i‚Äôm hoping), and the self-isolation will give you time to reflect on what you need to do. This isn‚Äôt a forever situation, but it‚Äôs just happening at an unfortunate time. You‚Äôve just gotta get comfortable with not knowing what the future holds"

vancouver,flgtjwo,t1_flgt9tw,1585150033.0,lol. you can't go to the media as a health authority employee. There will very likely be repercussions for this. That's why they have communications departments. Doesn't matter if it's a western nation....it works the same way with our provincial and federal governments. Anyone who disagrees with party policies and vocalizes it is ostracized.
vancouver,flgqwli,t1_flgqkep,1585148542.0,"300 physicians signed from providence health authority for a shut down, 60+ physicians from RCH, and now we've got nurses risking their jobs by being whistle-blowers & writing letters.

vancouver,flgqhet,t1_flgpm0t,1585148305.0,"They are saying this because they don't want people to suffer. I know shutting things down would make life difficult for many people, and we all need to put food on the table, but did you read that report that came out of saskatchewan? they are possibly looking at 9k-15k of the population dead as a result of COVID19. We've got to decide whether saving our economy is worth losing many people. I think BC govt has already made a decision on that...but for health care workers, their guiding principle is sanctity of life & do no harm.

Edit: there's no hazard pay for hcw's. Just FYI. And lots of hcw's putting themselves in harms way without PPE. if anyone has something to lose from this, it's them."
vancouver,flgq2ob,t1_flgpopa,1585148072.0,"If you look at the list of nurses that signed it, they are from fraser health, vancouver coastal health, providence, provincial health services authority, island health. Not just Squamish nurses."

COVAnonymous,flfn4y2,t3_fnfl7b,1585111178.0,">But I'm scared I won't know how to do it properly. 

You probably won't. It will likely take a few mistakes, and the support of your colleagues to get through this. That being said, do NOT underestimate the power of your colleagues - the bond and relationship you build with them is going to be incredibly profound, and unlike anything you have experienced before.

>I'm scared I'll kill someone. 

If you don't try to help them, then they will likely pass away anyways. This isn't reason enough to not do the work.

>Or I'll have to decide who receives oxygen. 

You will never have to make that decision alone. The higher ups will determine that. But that being said, yes - this is likely to come up. There's nothing I can say to this besides my heart aches and aches and aches for both you and the patients involved. We are going to have to let some people go. Nobody wants to be the one doing that - but what choice do we have?

>I'm worried mentally my brain won't cope with all the death I'm going to see. 

You know what, yeah, this is possible too. This is one of the most traumatizing events I think I have ever been a part of. It hasn't hit my community fully just yet, but I can smell it in the air and I have already started my grieving process. We are going to lose so many beautiful people, through no fault of their own. I have to remind myself to focus on the beauty in this; there will still be people who make it alive. The world will still keep spinning.

>Then I'm worried for my partner and child, who are more at risk because of where I work. They also both suffer from asthma. 

Self-isolate, self-isolate, self-isolate & wear a mask at home. That's the only way.

AAAAND finally:  


> I want to go and help my workmates beat this bastard. 

Read your first line over and over again. This is world war III. You are literally a soldier in the trenches. This is david versus goliath, you are the underdog, you are smaller and less powerful than the thing you are trying to defeat. But you know that if you don't go, the bad dude wins. And nurses hate letting the bad dude win. That's why you were called to do this job & why you are preparing to go to war. To protect & love humanity. What a blessing to be a part of that."

You‚Äôre correct in that I was exaggerating by saying nurses are ‚Äúfreaking out.‚Äù What i should have said is that the nurses (on my unit - who also work in other areas of the hospital), are anxious, worried, & fearful of the outcomes of COVID19. We are anxious because we know what the system‚Äôs capacity for care is, and we know that we do not have what we need at this moment in time. That could change in the future. The nurses I know are bracing for the worst, but have accepted it and are attempting to cope and find solutions as we move forward. We need PPE otherwise ICU staff will get sick. Many folks (on the ground) are thinking our curve is on par with Italy...but we have to see whether our early social distancing project made a dent in the numbers or not."

Govt and health authorities are filtering their msgs to the public to avoid spreading fear/panic but realistically we all need to have a healthy level of fear around this.

Edit: the hospital is quiet for now (calm before the storm), but a lot of staff expressing fear & anxiety over their family life, being deployed to another unit, PPE, and lack of infrastructure (ventilators). The higher ups are trying their best to address these issues for now"
