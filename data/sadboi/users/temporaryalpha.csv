For a long time it felt as though my life were on fire.  Divorce, lawsuit from my ex-wife, threat to lose my job, and then getting dumped by the person who I'd thought was the love of my life.

So many (everyone) told me she wasn't the love of my life *because the love of my life wouldn't have dumped me, lied/sent such mixed signals, and then ghosted me*.  She compartmentalized me right out of her life; she didn't care what she said to do it; she just wanted it done.

I have to survive for my children, because I've survived so much in my life, because I did everything right in that relationship, just like I did in my marriage, and because, finally, thanks to my discovery of this subreddit, I realized *I am a better person than she is*.

I'm serious.  I determined long ago to be kind and good, no matter what.  I have worked **hard** at that.
I kept my character through an awful divorce, and I'm going to keep my character though I was dumped by someone I truly loved who didn't deserve me.

Two years of intense intimacy.  And she *ghosted me*!

I've already begun texting my support team to tell them what happened to me tonight.

I feel lighter than I have in a long time. Divorced from a narcissist, free from pain over a woman who dumped the best man she ever will know.  I don't know how long this feeling will last, but it exists.  I know that now.  And that's enough.

I mean wtf!

I've reached the point where generally the only bad part of the day is the beginning, when I first wake up and think of her.

I used to call her every morning to wake her up so her first thought wouldn't be of her ex-husband.

My experience now is ironic.

What's even harder is that, while the divorce progressed (my ex had multiple boyfriends), I met someone truly wonderful.  And she dumped me.  RIGHT before the divorce ended.

So I've been struggling with two losses.

Weird is that the woman who dumped me still has me connected to her calendar.  Intentionally.  But she won't talk to me, the few times I tried to ask about what happened, she said it's too much pressure.  

I finally, finally, finally stopped trying to contact her.  I could disconnect her from my calendar, but I think she still loves me.  And I will say it here: she is the love of my life.

Oh this story is complicated.  I'm sorry.  I just...fuck.

Listen.  This is one of my new values.  (I've become someone else since all this started years ago).

Ramana Maharshi was a jivanmukta, a Hindu holy man.  This lesson was attributed to him:

Q: How are we supposed to treat others?  
A: There are no others.

This is who I am now; I'm still in love with the woman who dumped me, and I'm trying not to think about her while I focus on myself and my children, learn to love myself, and try to have a life worth living.

Meanwhile I'm starved for companionship, even while knowing I'm nowhere close to ready.

Thanks to certain meditation techniques I've changed the narrative in my head to one of loving myself.  But every morning I wake up stressed/anxious, missing her, then I make a checklist of things to do, get out of bed, keep myself busy following my checklist, and manage to get through the day.

I hate counting the days of my life away.

And her ability to project!  *I* controlled; *I* prevented her from being happy.  While the whole time she refused ever to make a big decision, never surrendered to what I might want.  Once she said she'd never even thought of what my dreams might be.

Divorce,eq6k27w,t1_eq6foan,1559830557.0,"Seriously, thanks for the clarification!  

But I didn't say that the idea of soulmates springs from Buddhism.  I said that many ideas are tied to the idea that life is short and unless we're bold and take chances, believing in ourselves, we torture ourselves needlessly.

I'm pretty sure that *all* of that can be found in Buddhism.  I'm not sure I'm a practicing anything other than a person trying to understand my place in the universe, what's real and what's not, and what ideas, if any, are worth believing.

As yet another aside, the [greatest science fiction novel ever written](http://www.editoreric.com/greatlit/books/Stars-My-Destination.html) contains the epiphany: *It isn't necessary to have something to believe in. It's only necessary to believe that somewhere there's something worthy of belief.*

In any event, I wish you peace on your journey."
Divorce,eq61opf,t1_eq60pbf,1559819889.0,"I agree with this.  And/or maybe we just have to grow until we're ready for ""the one"".  And maybe we don't meet them in this life.

I say all of this because, as I've detailed in this alt, I've been struggling with a terrible marriage for years--until last year, when I actually did meet *the one*.  She and I match in every way.  We are so perfect for each other that we marvel at it.

And, upon talking to friends, I've learned that some--some--feel that way about their mates, too.  It's like a secret culture of soulmates.

That said, one friend scoffs at my ideas.  Maybe rightly so.

But when you meet *the one*, it changes every idea about reality.  As goofy as it sounds, it makes the ideas of transmigration and the karmic wheel seem real.

I think all of this is one more reason why we never should stay in a bad marriage.  This life is short; unless we're bold and take chances, believing in ourselves, we torture ourselves needlessly.

There are so many ideas tied to this--the idea of being *woke*, for instance.  The idea of [The Power of Now](https://smile.amazon.com/Power-Now-Guide-Spiritual-Enlightenment-ebook/dp/B002361MLA/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=power+of+now&qid=1559820000&s=gateway&sr=8-3) and the Buddhist idea that [suffering springs from desire](https://smile.amazon.com/Its-Easier-Than-You-Think-ebook/dp/B0053K10J2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=6B0F1YHVMWXO&keywords=it%27s+easier+than+you+think+by+sylvia+boorstein&qid=1559820038&s=gateway&sprefix=it%27s+easier%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-1).  Heck even [The Matrix](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-matrix) is about waking up to reality and the idea that spiritual rules underlie everything we know.

Gang of Youths [sing about this kind of thing a lot](https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/musicnews/youtube:-gang-of-youths---the-heart-is-a-muscle-official-video/9471836):  
*I will look at love as more than*  
*Just an instrument of pain*  
*And will give myself completely*  
*To the moving and the strange.*

Joyce wrote about it at the end of Ulysses, when Molly Bloom, basking after lovemaking, with her mixed ideas of loyalty and love, concluded the book with the life-affirming word *Yes*.

It's everywhere, this idea that you owe yourself self-awareness.  And the corollary that we restrict ourselves by damaging rules we impose upon ourselves.

Honestly, it seems to me that so much about reality we simply don't understand yet.  I'm fully ready to believe that soulmates are just one more result of cause and effect, which is, at heart, the underlying rule of at least one aspect of reality."

So Thursday while I'm discussing it with my son, *she* comes in, asks what we're talking about, says she wants to go.  My son--who she's alienated for months--after some minutes says, ""You can go"". 

The next morning (she'd stewed on this all night) she began texting me angry paranoid rants about how ""next time I should say something"" when we're planning a trip.  Instead of simply saying ""Ok"" (which, really, is the only safe response to a narcissist) I said, ""We did"".  Oh boy did that set her off.  On and on and oh btw she'd already made plans for the day (for herself) *not five minutes before* (yeah right), which she wouldn't have made if she'd known we were planning this.

Then, finally,  Saturday, the day before the trip, I asked if she were going with us.  She said, ""I already have plans"".  And how she didn't want to be an extra wheel.  Then she changed her plans to go with us.

Yesterday.  The trip.  She kept to herself, hardly spoke to any of us.  Our son said, ""She didn't want to go with us.  She just didn't want to be left out"".
