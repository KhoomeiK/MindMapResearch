VALORANT,fr0e5s0,t1_fqzn0jx,1589792417.0,"idk if you watched her clip but they were CLEARLY harassing her for being a woman with all that ‚Äútextbook woman‚Äù shit. 

and it‚Äôs an issue because of multiple reasons. apart from making the overall experience less enjoyable for everyone (its a game made for entertainment), they are also sabotaging their team. that is detrimental not only to the direct victim of the harassment but to the rest of the team who are just trying to win. 

women unfortunately have it way worse than men when it comes to multiplayer games. and yes, it is a sexism issue. and the fact that women expect this shit when entering a match and the fact that toxicity is to be EXPECTED is clearly a huge red flag."
Kaguya_sama,fqyh8e1,t1_fqydx3d,1589748544.0,"i just found the contrast between her headstrong attitude and her crippling stage fright all while aspiring to be student council president to be a little off-putting. i‚Äôm not saying she can‚Äôt have stage fright or get nervous, but i find it hard to believe that someone who clearly had no problems with voicing her very snarky opinions to the previous student council president to have trouble delivering a speech to an audience

in the scenes depicted, she‚Äôs not casually chatting to people. she is advertising her campaign. and in the past, she wasn‚Äôt talking to people out of casual conversation. she was calling them out for not following the rules."

Regarding your last point about Episode 5, the reason I included that was because in the next episode, you can see people coming around to her ideas when she expressed them more eloquently.

We were having a discussion in class about Rich Asshole Syndrome and one of the discussion questions was ""what can we do to humble ourselves as privileged people?"" and I kid you not the PRESIDENT of one of these damn organizations was dead-ass like ""I think we should join organizations such as \*her organization\* because these organizations provide you with opportunities to go into less privileged areas"" and I kid you not I blew up at her for it.

Being part of these organizations don't make you more humble, if anything they make you less humble for giving you the feeling of this important person sacrificing your energy and time to go help those underprivileged. And it sounds so nice on paper but in reality it's just snobby high schoolers selling cupcakes during break time and then calling that a successful fundraiser. People in my school can't even fathom that anyone would ever want to associate themselves with people ""below"" them, and that makes me angry on so many levels it's unreal. 

Some of my best friends come from those ""poor, underprivileged"" backgrounds(which basically means that they can't afford international travel every year for summer vacation) and to see people in school feel like they are too good for ""these people"" really makes me angry. People are not defined by their parent's yearly wages, and to see literal CHILDREN think that they are too good for certain people because their parents can afford multiple vacations to Punta Cana every year makes me fume."

I think that it's also important for you to talk to your sister and explain that you need your space. She's 14, she should be able to understand that you are not obligated to be around her 24/7 and that you have your own life. If she doesn't, then talk to your parents. Be sure to not be attacking or hostile. Just say something like ""hey, I know you want to hang out but I want to be alone rn"" or something like that. Your sister also needs to understand that you are not obligated to spend time with her just because you're siblings. Setting boundaries is so important.

relationship_advice,fflt7gb,t1_fflsbae,1580043831.0,"i live in bolivia, and believe me the psychology department here will not make things better for you. 

that said, i still believe i have a lot of things i need to fix about myself, like increasing my self-esteem, being more independent, being less jealous, etc. the problem is how do i do it. 

i understand that it might be overwhelming having to care about someone who isn‚Äôt mentally healthy, but how can i balance communication and dealing with things on my own?"
relationship_advice,fflso0e,t1_ffls967,1580043659.0,"he‚Äôs told me explicitly before that he wished that i told him what i‚Äôm feeling no matter how small it might be and i have been trying to adhere to that but when i tell him that i don‚Äôt like it when he diminishes the problem, he responds back with ‚Äúso you want me to lie to you‚Äù

i guess im just trying to get what hashing our feelings really means. i know for sure it‚Äôs not fighting, but how can we have a calm conversation about these things?"
