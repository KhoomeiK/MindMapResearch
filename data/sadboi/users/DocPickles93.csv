AmItheAsshole,ff70szf,t3_erwpm1,1579638847.0,NTA! You're watching their kid for free they should be happy that you're saving them money for the food the kiddo eats at your house. Also who can't afford fresh fruits and bread?! Apples are like $1.25 a pound. Stupid cheap.
AmItheAsshole,ff6zx46,t3_ervvgd,1579638332.0,"NTA!!!! OP I am so glad I stumbled across this thread! I was homeschooled K-12 along with my 9 siblings (we were mormon), and I hated every moment of it. Being locked in our house all day year after year with minimal socialization outside of church on sundays and the handful of years we were involved in a weekly homeschool group. I could go on and on about my life experiences being homeschooled by needless to say I believe it to be a huge disservice to children as it deprives them of the social foundation that our society has been build on for hundreds of years. On top of that 99% of homeschooling parents aren't even giving their children anything close to an adequate education. Few adults in my experience are educated enough to give their kids a well rounded and thorough education. On top of that school books and supplies are very expensive and most homeschool families can't afford up to date math and science textsbooks. Additionally if your kids have learning disabilities parents are not equipped to help them reach normal scholastic levels. Homeschooling should be illegal in the USA, it's a hotbed of abuse and illiteracy and should be classified as abuse. NTA again."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fdmfilr,t3_efimj4,1578548189.0,"I'm so glad I stumbled onto this thread. I had an experience that I can only explain as sleep driving. I used to live on the top of a four mile hill. The road was super winding, steep and slightly dangerous if you weren't familiar with it. I lived there for almost 2 years between the ages of 19-21. I worked full time, was a full time student in college and partied alot. I was in and out of the house all the time so in those two years and probably drove up and down that hill a thousand times. One night I was super tired and I dont remember leaving this party but the next thing i knew i was in my driveway and it was several hours since the last time i had looked at the time. I've always been  good at zoning out especially when doing a repetitive task but this time was different and to this day I can't explain it."

The swelling should go down in a few hours and you'll have some bruising in the surrounding area. It'll be sore but should heal within a week."

mentalillness,eu40ai9,t1_eu4039a,1563432301.0,First of all thanks for your input and concern its appreciated.üòÄ My son is starting day car in a few weeks so she won't be alone with him anymore. We're looking into trying to get people to stay with her as much as possible. Unfortunately her physiatrist and physician haven't seen the need to put in a request for in home care.
Huntingtons,eu3zori,t3_ccoymf,1563431565.0,My wife was diagnosed at 18 with juvie HD. She's 23 now and has fairly severe symptoms. We've been married almost three years and despite everything we've been thro I'd do it over again and I know she would too. Don't live your life in the shadow of HD. Live your life in spite of it. Take every day for what its worth.
mentalillness,eu3zcb5,t1_eu3z1lw,1563431151.0,I patched up my shaky relationship with my parents for my wife and son. They love them both to pieces and are amazing in laws and grandparents. My wife's adopted parents live close and are pretty involved. My mother in law was the care giver to my wife's birth mom who passed away 8 years ago. And several other family members who've had HD. However she's having some health issues of her own preventing her and her husband from being super active in our lives. But she's a great resource for how to cope and manage my wife's symptoms. I have other close family my wife and son stay with when I'm away for training. I have a great support network but no one has the money to just live with us to help take care of her.
mentalillness,eu3ytp3,t1_eu3xgac,1563430533.0,Also thank you for your words of encouragement üòÅ
mentalillness,eu3ysiv,t1_eu3yhtl,1563430496.0,Thank you so much. My greatest concern is my son.  I don't want him to grow up hating his mom or having a depressed angry dad. So I'm trying my best to be the best for him. Now and in the future. I am fortunate to have the support network I do. I'll try to see if there's anything else I can tap into.

So it's kinda a wait till it's really bad deal. We have friends and family fairly close by so they help as much as they can."
