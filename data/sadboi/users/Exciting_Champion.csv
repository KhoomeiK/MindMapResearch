If you have any question about women game dont hesitate to ask. The women and men in this subred will try to give you the best answer they can. 

But still if there just aren't so much women caring here about their game, there is obviously not that much content. Simple statistics."

DecidingToBeBetter,fox953x,t1_fox8inf,1588137234.0,"okay i see. So as i said you shouldnt either always look on the 50 pounds or on the all of the amount of your dept. 

lets talk about the credit card first. Lets say you can repay an amount of 200$ dollars every month. Now you can look at your bank account every month and be proud of yourself that you paid back 200$ dollars, no matter how much money is left of your whole credit. 
Losing weight is something alot of people are struggeling with. One idea here is that you start eating more healthy (maybe you can also safe some money here to repay your depts) and to some exercise. This could be walk everyday for 15 mins (maybe you can walk to your workplace). 
Just do this small steps and keep going, dont focus on the 50 pounds all the time. 
the way is the aim"

When your goal is to be better in a certain sport, doing more push ups or running faster you shouldnt always look on the the final best time you want to achieve. Focus more on the fact that you improve after every exercise and that you still keep going.   
what exactly are your targets?"
DecidingToBeBetter,fou1tkq,t3_g98e6z,1588073735.0,"I kind of went through the same this year and can totally feel you.

For me it helped alot to watch some videos on youtube about what is actually happening in your brain when you play video games/smoke weed/porn or whatever.

Your brain pures out dopamin and you feel satisfied, the same feeling you get when you do something productive, even something easy like cleaning your room.

For me this made clear that i have to cut off all those things out of my life, if i want to achieve something.

So now everytime i get the the desire to do those things i just remind myself why i stopped and that i want to achieve something.

Hopefully this is helpful. Keep going!"

DecidingToBeBetter,foejojo,t3_g6mx7g,1587705546.0,"I actually stopped porn around 3 weeks ago and it feels amazing. I realised how much of my motivation was wasted on porn.
If you watch porn and masturbate your brain pours out Serotonin. Thats why i could stay in bed all day when i had a day of and just watch porn. I gave the unnatural sarisfaction other productive things like Sport and cleaning you room Do. 
It's not only porn also things like social media, gaming and other stuff have the same effect. There are alot of really helpfull Youtube-Videos about this. 

However i actually dreamed that night about watching a porn. I felt really bad afterwards in my dream. This shows that i still have to be carefully and stay away from this bad habit."

I am also currently learning the handstand and for me it reminds me of the fact that i can achieve alot when i put in enough effort. 

In the past i was someone who just though 'i am who i am an i can change anything'
Bad marks -> i am stupid learning wont help me
Slow runner  -> Bad lungs training wont help
Dirty room -> i am just not the Person who cleans up

However since i work on self improvment i realise that if i put enough effort and time in something i can actually achieve alot. 

Same is with the handstand. Back in the past i'd have thought 'either you can do it or you cant'. 
Now i know and realise that for sure i can learn it

So some friends and i myself invest in Biotechs. Basically it all started as one friend worked at the company that publish a stock letter about biotechs (most of them small). There are basically 2 strategies as far i know. 

So the main thing that Biotechs stock price is depeneded on, are Study results. Biotechs develop drugs and life from investors money. Drug development has diffent phases and at every new state the biotech publishes news. If the news are good the stock price can go up 300%-400%. But if its bad  you lose alot.

e.g. take Infalrx where the stock price when from 30$ to 3$ in 1 day 

but in last 2 weeks it wen from 2,65$ to 5,50$ so you could make about 100% here.

([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ifrx](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ifrx)) 

There are other news like mergers, a new management etc. which can also highly affect the stock price. 

So the thing is when those Biotechs have a bad news they become undervalued and if they still have other assets and a good management there is a chance that you make a good earning with that. Thats what my friends are doing.

Those investments are all short till mid term. If you want i can keep you up with new knowledge i collect"
DecidingToBeBetter,fn6mv53,t3_fzx86n,1586703081.0,"I had a strong LoL addiction in January and now i play a bit to much CoD Warzone. 

The thing with gaming in general is, that it is an easy way to pour out serotonin. I realize this a lot, when i dont play video games. I need to do productive things like online classes, sport or reading books to feel good. But those things are like ""hard"" to do you have to sit down focus etc. 

Gaming gives you the same feeling in a much easier way. Basically why we like gaming so much is because the success we can find there is much easier to find, then in real life.  

Good luck for the future"
