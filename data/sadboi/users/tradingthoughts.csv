Then, I learned I can’t stop them all at once. Then, I learned which ones did what. Finally, I figured out I could adjust certain medications by +-25% to create the effect that I want it to. But I keep a close eye on my mood following the adjustment. I’ve curbed an episode unsuccessfully probably five times and successfully just once, this last year. I hope this works for you and gives you the results you’re after."

The message you’re casting is that conservative views on Reddit are downvoted more heavily than liberal ones. Well you’re fucking right because most people on Reddit can’t stand conservative bullshit. So they use their voting power to disagree with those posts, and in some cases, comment to prove an extra point.

As long as I live, I will downvote posts and comments that I don’t like. Voting is what makes this site so great. You don’t like voting? Then stick to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram."
