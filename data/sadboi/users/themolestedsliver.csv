Then your argument *is even worse* because countering commanders *on top of everything else I said* is horrible in terms of prevention since they can recast it in the future. It becomes a tempo play above all else.

Jesus the mental gymnastics.

No what I was actually saying, is that to counter something you need to spend mana and a card as opposed to drannith which just prevents the spell from being cast in the first place.

These are entirely different circumstances you are acting as if they are one in the same because you have no idea what you are talking about. 

Also, counter-spells are inherently part of magic the gathering, meanwhile drannith is A card that is ONLY good because of a SPECIFIC rule for A SPECIFIC FORMAT.....but sure, keep ignorantly saying they are the same thing i guess....whatever helps you sleep at night.

Good for you, this doesn't matter at all for the chief argument against Drannith so....

>I can only prevent counters by playing blue with uncommon exceptions like Rhythm of the Wild or Domri

You must not be playing long if you think that is the only work around from counters.

You can fake out spells for them to waste counter magic on, you can wait until they are tapped out. These are all very common and consistent ways to beat counterspells that you ignoring purely to give this hot take that makes no sense."

Yes this is very different from not being able to cast your commander all together. You have to spend resources (mana card advantage) in order to counter the spell and in terms of a spell they can recast a counter is actually worse since it mainly just delays it. Quite different than prevention all together. 

>Should containment sphere be banned too because it stops you from actually using your commander?

There numerous cards that return control on top of counter magic, hexproof, etc so Idk how this is relevant at all.

>My point is: there are worse things than Drannith Magistrate, and it should be an indictment on the state of magic that such a recently released and low power card has been banned.

For one, I'm sorry you disagree but the fact remains that Drannith did **way** to much for 2 mana in brawl. His interactions with commanders heavily inflated his power which was unhealthy for the format and to say he is low power cause he can die to removal is a very shortsighted argument. 

Also you are conflating ""very strong cards that borderline broken"" with ""cards that are ONLY strong because of the nature of brawl"" WAYYYY too much.

Yes t3feri is a good card, but he is also heavily played in standard as well....Can you say the same for drannith? No, of course you can't. 

>I dont see how using Drannith Magistrate in brawl because it shuts down part of the format is any different than the other cards I mentioned that shut down parts of formats.

Well I am sorry you can't understand the nuance involved there but ""I still don't get it"" is hardly a reasonable argument. 

> ""people only use drannith because it shuts down commanders!"" Yeah, and people use T3feri because it shuts down interactivity.

Oh stop, I've already thoroughly explained how t3feri is VERY different than drannith in several different aspects now. Facts don't warp and change around your hatred of t3feri fam. 

>Before you get ""holier than thou"" step back and realize you told me to learn to play magic in response to suggesting this ban is a little over dramatic.

Well, when you wanna talk down to me and explain very basic stuff for a format *purely* because I disagree with you then I am going to show you the same level of respect.

>This is a thing in EDH and should be in Brawl. Meddling mage, nevermore, Drannith Magistrate. All cards with white identity that exhibit white control.

So my argument is not wrong because ""spikeier players"" disagree'd with you? What does that even mean?

I doubt we've played magic at all together so these judgement calls based on nothing are pretty bad ways to come at this from. How do you know I am not a spikier player? 

>>Drannith abuses the nature of the format and saying ""if you think so you are less experienced"" hardly changes that fact.

>This is true, but I don’t think it makes it bannable. [[Angel of vitality]] and [[Twinblade Paladin]] also abuse the nature of the format.

Oh stop, you are comparing apples and oranges.

*Yes* you are right **technically** angel of vitality and twinblade abuse the nature of the format and the higher life total. 

**that being said***

There is a massive difference from a card being good because of having a high life total, versus a card only good because of the most notable aspect/namesake of the format. 

You claim to be interesting in ""spikeier players"" mindsets, yet give me such a knee jerk hot take I'm rather confused. 

Both of the cards you showed would **still** be good if the game started at 20. Obviously they wouldn't be as good but they would still be good. 

Meanwhile if you errat'd drannith to say ""doesn't effects commanders in brawl or edh"" he would taken out of 99% of decks I am sure of it. 

So in reality you are comparing cards that are a bit better because of the format but still good cards in general, versus a card that is only relevant *because* of the most notable part of said format.....Yeah totally ""abuses the nature of the format"" in the same way...

Also, this is not even considering the fact that both creatures **you can interact with more**. Since both aspects of what you said are combat related then the nature of having creatures helps balances the advantages they get from the format. Meanwhile the ONLY way to interact with drannith is removal....specifically. 

So no, Hardly comparable. 

>I think wizards is catering to the largest group of players - Casuals on arena. Sure I might be wrong. That’s just how I interpet it.

...But you aren't giving any arguments aside from blindly asserting such. I understand this may be *just your opinion* but saying blanket statements on those who disagree with you is not a healthy way to talk about anything frankly speaking. 

**Why** do you think this appeals to mainly casuals? 

>I think spyglass is stronger than Magistrate, because it’s harder to interact with and provides significant hand information as well as being flexible by naming a card other than their commander.


Although I agree it should not be understated that drannith is also quite flexible in the extent that he blocks companions, adventure, winota, fiend artisan as well as your decks namesake card. 

Another reason why he is getting the ban. 

>Commander prevention is strong, but I don’t think it’s overpowered.

Drannith being OP really never the main facet of the argument. He is just not fun to play against and abuses the most notable part of the format in a very non interactive way. Requiring the opponent to have removal otherwise they can't use their chief namesake card (along with the other shit i said before) is unhealthy for the format.

>It should slow you down until you are able to remove it not dismantle your entire deck.

But if they have recursion, counter spells, protection, etc what then? Again, it is not that the card is super OP can't win against it....it's just not fun and is only good because of its inflated value. 

>Why is being an auto include poor game design? Is [[Agent of treachery]] bad design? Is [[Murderous rider]] bad design? Should we ban [[Gaurdian project]] too?

Jeez strawman much?

Those cards are auto include **because there good fucking cards**

Drannith is an auto include because **you are playing brawl, a commander based format**

...Really didn't think I needed to hold you hand into why those auto includes are different. 

>I’m genuinely curious about your opinion. Please let’s debate the power levels of cards and not the fact that I format weird and accidentally implied that people who disagree with me are worse players.

>-yes dies to removal is real argument, if Dranith is planeswaker or enchantment or creature with hexproof and indestructible, he will be completely different power level.

....No shit? How does that magically change the fact that saying ""ummm you can remove the creature"" is a complete non-argument? 

He wasn't printed as either of those things so why are you bringing them up irrelevantly here? ""Oh shit, what if he was MORE OPPRESSIVE"" like what does that hope to accomplish?

>survivability is big part of card evaluation, especially for card with static ability where you want it to stay as long as possible. different cases for cards with ETB or LTB trigger ability.

You're right, but you are explaining a **massive** more amount of nuance than ""dur hur it dies to murder"" which should be required when seriously discussing a card. 

Drannith forces the opponent to have removal or prevents them from casting the namesake card in their deck and that is not a fun mechanic in the game. How does ""BUT MURDER"" change that notion?

>being singleton is also very important part of how a card impacts the game.

Again with the down talking...Yes it being singleton is relevant but using that to vaguely say someone is wrong whilst at the same time gate keeping them is not how you have a serious discussion. 

>you are not guaranteed to have it always in early game.

Drannith is relevant at all stages of the game so this is completely irrelevant. 

> drawing Dranith on turn 10++ where your opponent already have their commander on the battlefield is very bad.

....But if you remove their commander they can't recast it without spending resources on drannith...or am I not allowed to apply your same logic against you or something?

Nah sorry it is going to take a lot more then vague negative comments to make me doubt my magic knowledge.

Its because you are comparing apples and oranges.

Not only is Tale's End a one time use spell, **all** of its other mods are very relevant whilst drannith is only used specifically for the interaction with commander.


Obviously Tale's End is popular because it counters commander but it also counters **all planeswalkers** on top of being a stifle if you really need it (consider agent of treachery for instance ).

So with that being explained. The difference is Tale's End is just a good card that happens to be good in a commander format whilst Drannith is only good because it abuses the format and requires removal otherwise you are playing 60 card singleton."
