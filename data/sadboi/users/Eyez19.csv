Otherwise, I used the vitabiotics wellteen plus her when I was 19, it was okay. A really great way of getting adequate vitamins and minerals is having a healthy and balanced diet. generally, girls lose iron during the periods so can become anemic and if you live in a country with hardly any sunshine, you wouldn't be getting proper amounts of vitamin D.
Like mentioned before, you can get blood work done because it's best to take something if you actually need it and remember to eat healthy food, work out and stay hydrated. :)"
