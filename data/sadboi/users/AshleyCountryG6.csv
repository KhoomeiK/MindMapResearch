socialanxiety,fcph1g5,t3_eicf5y,1577863682.0,"Yes and I am always alone, isolating myself and wish I had friends until they left, either replace me or stop being my friend because I moved out of state because Of my stepdad like he still calls me names and puts me down but everything that has happened to me caused me to isolate even when people don’t understand is my only option because my anxiety and depression is so bad I can’t be around people because I feel like I burden people with my problems. I never had any friends because if they was friends they would never leave me because I moved to get abused and makes me want to go back to him more because I thought they would come back around when I came back but they didn’t talk to me until March of 2019 when I came back in August 2018 just to leave me on read after talking to me and never talking to me again is why I stay in my room all day, I never feel like doing anything or motivation to do anything but my bed is the only place I want to stay and isolate myself because I feel like I got nobody anymore but my boyfriend who treated me wrong caused my friends to Leave me. I just will never walk up anywhere alone or open up in public because I am afraid to make friends just to be treated the same way like my friends did but I also left because they hit me up until they stop hitting me up anymore, my stepdad putting me down and what really triggers my anxiety and depression on Facebook is the laugh reaction and just because I say my opinion doesn’t mean people have to laugh at anything I say so I see people like that wants to see me cry because people laugh at a comment I say or feel like I shouldn’t open up to people and shake a lot because I am a very sensitive person but nobody can understand that I told them not to do that cause me want to say something because I don’t like it is the reason I go back to abuse to escape all that because I feel nobody ever understands or will ever like me but I just feel worthless and feel nobody wants to talk to me because of my depression and because I still talk to him. I don’t open up and reach out in public because they don’t talk to me which I have always not opened up which I feel it will always be that way just like I don’t feel comfortable talking on the phone or ordering my own food because that’s me. Nobody came around for my birthday, Christmas and now New Years so I have always been alone since I been back in Georgia."
depression,fane9ls,t1_fandqzg,1576236934.0,"No my mom tells him to stop and I just don’t want her talking nice to him sometimes and she can’t move until she gets her taxes so I am the only one who will help her because she is just like me because she ain’t got no friends either. She drinks because he gets her to drinking the way he calls her a drunk and call me names. I have nowhere to go because I don’t want to live on my own, I don’t feel comfortable on my own and my mom said if me and her go to a shelter they will take mine and her money so she decide not to and stay where she is at until she gets her taxes. If she don’t move and my stepdad was to leave and get a divorce I will be going back to the guy who abused me but that’s the reason why my friends turned on me because I got abused but the first time it wasn’t me getting abused they didn’t want to support me or want to be my friend because I moved when it was stepdad calling me names is why I moved. If they really cared they would not have left me and I came back knowing they will hang out with me or be my friend and the ones I am talking about never asked me to hang out since I been back but they talked to me to stop talking to me or leave me on read when I said how I feel so I isolate myself because they stopped talking to me so I lost motivation to open up to people because I am afraid of being rejection and bullying or more so I rather people come talk to me first because I don’t know what to say. I only get out to go to the grocery store and doctor but church never works for me because nobody talks to me their anyways so I feel alone. She can only take me places on days she is not working because her only day off is Tuesdays is the only time I leave the house so the rest of the week I stay in my room sleeping and mostly skip lunch because I am too tired to eat but even when I do eat I still feel exhausted to do anything including my hands shaking and so I started recording my stepdad putting me down and calling me names. I got ignored no matter if I had friends or not but I am always alone because everyone stopped talking to when I think it’s my mental health when if they ignore me because of that and all I want is them to be there for me and support I feel like they don’t care or understand. Nobody came to my party but my mom is the only family I got that lives in the same city as me so I have no help because most of all my family members is gone and my sister doesn’t talk to me. My sister did say this though she said Okay if you want to get beat on just so you can keep your money then that's on you you're not my sister anymore if you leave Mom. 
I am still not over that because I keep it in my notes what she said on my phone but she don’t talk to me anyways so I don’t know what that supposed to mean so I feel like I have no support whatsoever so I be isolating myself."
depression,falw7xq,t3_e9kzfw,1576191525.0,"That’s how I feel and I am afraid to open because there is a reason and not a reason why I don’t feel  I should open up  because it’s everything. I have been rejected, left on read, ignored and I feel like I will be judged is why I do not even do anything for myself so when I am in public I get my mom to order my food for me and talk on the phone for me. I don’t know what to say or cope about it because my friends left me anyways to the point I have nobody and I am always isolating myself because I feel alone."
depression,f96rth9,t3_e3sl6j,1575150816.0,"When it comes to being friends with someone I feel nobody will love me for who I am, I believe people ignore me because of my depression and nobody will understand so I isolate myself everyday because I feel so alone because it's like I have no friends. I am done being the one reaching out first when I get ignored and rejected because I was left on read but then didn't hear from them in 7 months. I remember them friends turned on me when I had moved to another state because they didn't support me anymore or want to be my friend when I moved then they found out I got abused by the guy I am still with in a long distance relationship because he is the only one who will talk to me because my stepdad always put me down and called me names is why I moved, Everyone started ignoring me, not hitting me up anymore, people who laugh react to anything I say on Facebook based on anything about my opinion when one was I said awesome fan art so anybody will laugh at anything I say is why I keep going back to him because that's my only escape. I don't be around people because I think they don't understand me and I don't want to open up first just to get rejected and on a urge of a breakdown. I don't need friends who would leave me over a relationship that is bad just because I left to get away from my stepdad putting me down and calling me names. I am not all that in the head because I am special needs person and have a disability which I will never open up and never did because I am afraid of getting bullied, rejected and more is why I rather people come to me first so I would know what to say is why I don't also open up because I don't know what to say or talk is why the only friends I had left me which he is only one who talks to me and didn't ignore me like they did. I feel nobody will ever understand is why I don't be around people, I don't walk up anywhere alone, order my own food and talk on the phone for lots of reasons because I have always been like that. I feel nobody will like for me for who I am and not leave me on read or stop talking to me because of how I feel, my depression and who I am with."
depression,f8wjybm,t1_f8wiu7q,1574892516.0,I have already talked to a mental health lady at my doctor last month but my mom got so much on her mind she had forgot my last appointment but they prescribed me some medicine but I didn't take it for one day and forgot because Everytime I took medicine I only took it one day but it's not that I don't want to I don't want to take medicine that is going to make me shake because I didn't start shaking until I took Prozac when I was 17 then I got off of it then the shaking continues which my hands always shake when I wake up and even when I have my drink under the drink machine when I am out in public so I don't know what could be the problem. I don't want to push people away or reject me because I shake when I can't help it and not want to be around me or I hope I don't have bad nerves because I went to the doctor one time they said it is tremors but it seems more than tremors to me because I don't open up in public So I don't know what to say then I get nervous is why I don't walk up by myself when I am in public or order my food myself but I could use someone to talk to.
depression,f8wfmlp,t3_e2gnrw,1574889717.0,"I don't only sleep to escape the pain, I sleep because I feel so alone and Isolated because I feel better when I am away from people than to be judged or misunderstood especially even when I am around people I still feel alone even when I am a crowd full of people so next Thursday is my birthday which will be the loneliness day ever. I know I have family but I just feel like I just don't fit in or have the support like I really want because nobody came to my party last year on my birthday until people have stopped talking to me so I am getting on a urge of a mental breakdown because it makes me feel so alone then when I feel alone is why I am depressed so I sleep to escape from the pain and being ignored because I am not used to open up to people first unless they open up to me first because I don't want to get rejected, bullied, laughed at, misunderstood and looked at crazy or more but I have never opened up because I always been like that for so many reasons which I probably will always struggle opening up and walking up to places by myself but now I am not that kind of person like I always been and I just can't be around people who don't understand me is why I sleep to escape that and the pain. I am not real good at explaining how I feel and I just want to cry because I don't know what to do anymore because my friends left me in the first place because they didn't want to support me because I had moved when I was dealing with my stepdad putting me down and calling me names and I wish they could have understand me more or what I was going through so I feel they lied about being my friend if I came back just to talk to me to leave me on read and never talk to me again but it's like I have came across that friend in public to talk to she text me and now she don't talk to me or tell me why she has not me worried but she is the one friend like the others who didn't want to have anything to do with me because I was Getting abused and didn't want to be my friend if I didn't come back so she had called me and my mom names because my mom had no way to get me because my mom had to plan out how to get me because her car wouldn't make it because of her engine light which I was getting anxious yesterday because it cut off when she was on the road yesterday and had to keep recranking it but If her car stops running I would have no way around which I don't feel safe walking because of shootings and I don't trust myself getting a ride from someone I don't know because I feel like the only friends I had don't want to be my friend anymore because people stop talking to me or find other friends to hang out with when they find new friends they stop talking to me when I want people to talk to me when they have new friends or feel like I am wanted and loved. I mostly sleep all day everyday anyways and everything is the reason I went back to that guy because of how my friends changed or I think it's my depression and that they don't understand because I was moving away from my stepdad putting me down and calling me names. I am seriously on a urge of a mental breakdown now because I feel like I will judge typing this and lose my temper because I just want to be understood so I just isolate myself because people will always laugh react to my opinion on Facebook comment no matter what I say even when I said something about my favorite band I get laugh reacted to my comments because I said this is awesome so I rather stay to myself so I don't have to deal with that because it triggers my anxiety and depression and gets to a point I have to mention them in a comment to say something because I don't like them laughing at me based on my opinion when it's just how I feel. I feel no motivation to do anything anyways so I sleep all day and mostly too tired to eat lunch because I feel like they was my only friends who don't ever hit me up at all anymore. I am done dealing with something that will never come around again but if my mom is not lying about her and me moving to another city in Georgia I hope they will still support me if not then my life moves on but it's going to be hard making friends in a new city but she is talking about moving to a new city in Georgia to move away from him so she can save up to get a house but she said when she gets her taxes but I hate the thought of feeling alone and nobody knows how I feel but if she is I will be able to visit my sister because my mom is the only one who lives in the same city as me now but I just wish I knew how to get to know people but I am afraid of making friends who will reject me and stop talking to me completely. I am so depressed and got stuff on my mind I had to type this because I am dealing with too much right now and don't know how to cope or go about it anymore."
depression,f8kyzdh,t1_f8kb51z,1574616681.0,Yeah
depression,f8jrjkt,t1_f8jq8gk,1574603600.0,Yes I just need to know what to say when I make friends because I don't know how to get to know a person and I moved because my stepdad was putting me down and calling me names so my friends didn't support me or what to be my friend anymore because I had moved and I hear my stepdad cutting me down saying depression is just something for me to get my way when he just don't understand but there is no reason for my friends to turn on because I get abused because it was not my fault but if my stepdad would not have put me down I would not have moved but now I am back to that my mom said she has to wait until she gets her taxes to move and look for a place because my mom had no way to get me is when my friends called me and her names when her car wouldn't make it so she had to take out a loan to come get me is why she can't move right now because she got them loans so what he says to me causes my mom to drink but then my stepdad wants to call her a drink but I also recorded him because I couldn't take him calling me names so one he called me ugly and a fat slob just because he thinks I don't do anything when my mom doesn't make me or like it bothers her because of me not doing anything and also Calling me lazy when I don't want to be around him period.
depression,f8jj3lv,t1_f8jicd2,1574601018.0,"I just hate to feel people is out to get me or laugh at my pain when I said the word awesome and I get laughed at but just because I say something doesn't mean they have to laugh at anything whether it is funny or not because I have a phobia because I hate being laughed at until I get tired of it until they made me go off and cuss at them because they just don't understand. Today is the day I had lost my dad which he died November 24, 2004 which I was 7 and I am on a urge of a breakdown but it's so much too deal with and I also feel people will see me as a joke because I was diagnosed with slow developmental delay and speech and hearing impairment but I always isolate myself because I get called a attention seeker who don't understand is why I don't open up in public which I always been like that because I didn't even try to open up because I fear of getting bullied, judged and rejected like i wanted to be friends with people in school but they didn't feel the same way probably because I was not there type or because I was in a special needs class and wish people could accept me for who I am and not block me for my depression."
depression,f8jho1y,t1_f8jgpki,1574600388.0,I am just not good at understand things well because I am not all that in the head and don't know how to comprehend what I try to say but I am afraid of being bullied and rejected and most of all what triggers my depression is being laughed at even because it triggers my depression on Facebook the laughing reaction is why I isolate myself because I feel nobody understands or would leave me over a guy because my friends left me because I was getting abused then want to be my friend after the name calling so I told him I was moving and they didn't want to support me or be my friend because I moved out of state but I only left because my stepdad was calling names and putting me down which me going to a guy like that is my only escape from people laughing at anything I say on Facebook based on my opinion because it triggers my depression.
depression,f8jfw8b,t1_f8jfqyc,1574599729.0,Yeah
GunsNRoses,f2grukz,t3_ddffq5,1570234669.0,I wish If I had a way or a ride or a way to get tickets apparently if I had friends to go with and my mom let me travel alone it wouldn’t be a problem but I live in the United States and I don’t know where that is at
SuicideWatch,f2g7eqs,t3_ddd4q5,1570227338.0,Yeah
Hair,f22eq7x,t1_f22e2oy,1569887564.0,Okay
Hair,f22dtmh,t1_f22dcx8,1569886966.0,I have a straightening iron but I have not used it. I have washed my hair last night but when I put my hair up it was like that. I didn’t know if I could curl my hair with a straighten iron or not but I know I saw some hair products that is for curls when I went to the store at Walmart.
Hair,f225v4r,t1_f2228ub,1569882518.0,Oh how do I do that? I only have a straightening iron and one day I saw something at the store that people use for curls but I don’t know if it works on all hair types.
Hair,f21pzhn,t1_f20xr5o,1569875244.0,What do you mean? I wasn’t born with curly hair and I mean when I straighten and wash my hair it gets frizzy and knots get stuck in my hair and frizz up after I wash it. I wish I could get it dyed but I have no way of getting it done with my mom working and have no friends. I feel like I bought it for nothing!
Hair,f1ymbbg,t1_f1yldeg,1569819459.0,I mean I just want to it to show up right when I get it dyed pink and blue because I don’t want to dye my hair pink and blue on dark hair. I really want it to be where I don’t have to pay $100 or that is too expensive because I also got bills too pay. I want to dye it on light hair where it would show up better and when I used box dye I had missed some spots is why I don’t want to mess it up bleaching it because last November is when my mom dyed it which it turned blonde and red when I was trying to get it all blonde before dying it two different colors. My mom can never take me when she works and she don’t want to take me on days she is working and I have no way when my mom can’t take me.
Hair,f1yljhs,t1_f1ykuzn,1569818861.0,"Okay but my mom can never take me because she works and she don’t want to take me on days she is working but I don’t even have money like that if it cost that much and I don’t talk on the phone. I want it bleached then dyed so it will show up the way I want and if my mom can’t take me then I will never get it done so I feel like I bought the hair dye for nothing because I ain’t got no friends to do it since all the friends I had turned on me. I am slow in the head so I don’t understand some things how do I get a picture of what I want? My mom only takes me to the grocery store and doctor because she says I don’t have enough money to get it dyed at a salon so I guess I give up on finding someone to do it because of I have no friends because they want to turn on me because I got abused by the guy I am still in a long distance relationship with is why nobody talks to me and ignores me. I can’t pay $230 to $300 because I am on low income, ssi and disability and I have other bills to pay also."
Hair,f1ykpa2,t3_db6f9k,1569818262.0,"I am confused because I am not all that in the head, I can’t afford to get my hair done if it is $230 to $300 is what most charge, I ain’t got no friends either to it. I am wanting to go to a light blonde to get the color I want so it will show up light when i want it pink and blue because I already have the stuff the 30 developer and lighter with Arctic Fox which I don’t know if I need toner because some people use toner is what I heard."
