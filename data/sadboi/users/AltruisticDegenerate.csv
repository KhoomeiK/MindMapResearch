You might be safe or content but not truly happy. That is the only way to truly love yourself. Stop hating yourself! You are Valid you are loved. I know right now you are stuck and confused and all these emotions are overwhelming. At least you live in a time where there is help . Take one day at a time. The way I finally found help was asking my regular doctor to please find me a gender clinic. She found stuff that I could not seem to find on the net. Do not let mean people get you down. Mean people are the ones who hate themselves and want to drag you down. Misery loves company .just feel sorry for them and smile real big and act gay or whatever makes you happy.

asktransgender,fiwno2i,t3_fa4i3s,1582794005.0,"Mtf 45yo I always thought it was a curse and hated myself till I finally found support groups,friends, doctors and hormones. Now 1 year into transition I am really starting to enjoy life."
mentalillness,fivzo82,t3_fa1eay,1582771702.0,"This is the worst feeling. I  have felt like this off an on for 30 years and nothing makes it worse than your family not understanding. Like the other person said, No one can understand this horrible feeling unless they have experienced it themselves. Sometimes I think I  wish they would have to suffer like this just for one week then I think No ,I would never wish this on anyone. You said you just got a new job as a vet tech,that's awesome. I volunteer a lot at animal shelters just so I can play with the kittens and puppies. I also have a cat that I love more than life. She always helps me. Netflix is always good to. Lose yourself in some streaming or music."

MtFteens,fit2okq,t3_f9kwsl,1582701911.0,Baby I am 45years old and my mom still does this to me. It never ends lol. At Christmas she will drive to my house and drag me to Christmas dinner at grandma's. Forcing me to be around 30 homophobic racist relatives.I still can not figure out how I keep letting her do this to me . It takes a couple weeks to mentally recover
TransSpace,fit24gx,t3_f9kue3,1582701259.0,"This is insane, I am 9months into transition mtf in the U.S. and had a old man get in my face spitting mad screaming transgender are what's wrong with this country. This happened while I  was working  front desk at a hotel. When you see the facts that hate groups have quadrupled in this past year and I live in the deep south I am a little more than concerned"
AskGayMen,fis3fof,t1_firfq4c,1582676907.0,Lol sounds good.I just want to tell you that you are an amazing person. So much love and that is all that matters
AskGayMen,fir62u5,t3_f9abc3,1582658099.0,"Your son might be another daughter, he might be Transgender  just a thought."
AskMtFHRT,fipnfit,t3_f9561g,1582612851.0,"You will need to find a"" informed consent clinic"" like planned parenthood.make sure you google or ask reddit about the area you are moving to so you can get hold of one of these clinics before you get here.there is usually a couple months waiting list. Also I  started  DIY transition  at first and used spiro+ estrogel. I found rubbing the gel on your scrotum is much more effective."
SkincareAddiction,fiploxn,t3_f8qa0m,1582610988.0,"I always called this the YING AND THE YANG I also eat really healthy to get more ying , I told my therapist  this strategy and she said I  might just be a little crazy."
TransSpace,fipl6px,t3_f904ro,1582610470.0,God this topic just won't go away. I had a stranger walk up to me and start raving about the damn transgender are ruining this country. I am in the U.S. ...I think politics is putting us in more harm then usually.
askdrugs,fipkrz0,t3_f91b8v,1582610064.0,Years back I  grew a bunch of Hawaiian blue caps.this strain was super potent. The trip was like blodder acid. Anyway I  spent a couple hours giving these out to my friends. I got to work later that night and started tripping. I know I  didn't eat any all could think was I picked my nose or somehow absorbed through the skin.
