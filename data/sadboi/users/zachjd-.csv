Android,fp8z19h,t3_gblkj7,1588408075.0,I stopped using it recently because there's no way to organize anything.
civic,foxj1bp,t3_g9vmjx,1588145527.0,I'm paranoid with hail after everything I've experienced in Colorado. I'm glad my Civic is under a carport but I still feel insecure and check the weather every day before I go anywhere. I'm looking into an emergency car cover but there's really none out there besides the inflatable one. :/

90DayFiance,fomaky9,t1_fo8x9q1,1587883342.0,"I wonder if he knew what the conversion rate was or if he did much research before going there at all. However, shirts on the streets should be cheaper though according to my Filipino wife. My guess is they charged him more for the shirt because he's a foreigner but who really knows. I remember seeing a bunch of knock offs of Nike and Jordan on the streets but never bothered to go near them. Yeah it's cheap for us but to someone from there 480 might be a lot if that's what they normally charge."

Honda,fmn6kaj,t1_fm4ze87,1586219264.0,"Update on this. I no longer think it's the cover causing the issue. After I took my key ring/carabiner off my key fob, I had 0 problems with the Walk Away Auto Lock. Same with my second key, no problems. There must of been interference with the metal or something."
depression,fmh9x6l,t3_fv8ad9,1586071792.0,"I'll share what personally helped me stay focused and happy with these kept in the back of my mind.

1. Don't compare yourself to others and try to stay off of scial media. We've heard it before but it does help.

2. Age doesn't define what you should be doing. We all achieve different things at different times in our lives.

3. Don't live by anyone else's expectations of you. You are your own entity.  Do what you enjoy and walk your own path.

4. Drop any old beliefs holding you back from enjoying life, including religion if it comes to it.

5. Take one goal at a time and forget about how much time is passing. Things will come sooner or later if you work at it."
galaxys10,fmgm1f4,t1_fmgdmqw,1586052013.0,I agree.
Honda,fm4xa09,t1_fm4u3vj,1585762457.0,"I'll try that and see as I haven't been paying much attention to my phone. 

Also, I took the case off the key fob and continuing testing it and found it still beeped fast once with the case off too. :/

If it isn't the case and it isn't my phone, I have two other theories:

1. It possibly thinks a door is open somehow, IDK
2. Wireless interference where I'm parking(?)

If all else fails, I'll take it over to the dealership or maybe reset my headunit settings. My only fear is not being able to reproduce the issue once I get there."

depression,ezql9fp,t1_eznmm67,1568060757.0,Thanks. I wish I could share something but I have no problems in my life at all besides depression itself. Everything is my head creating problems that don't exist. I'm currently waiting on the results from a DNA cheek swab test. Done it before in 2014 but re-doing incase something has changed.
