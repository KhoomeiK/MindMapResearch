There are no rules, you do what makes you feel safe and if you struggle with guilt, please see a therapist to talk you through it. If you want a relationship with them, definitely see a therapist because that's a big can of worms to unpack and then forgive that kind of betrayal."
relationships,f6kncr6,t3_drq3ja,1572915962.0,"Recognize your worth. If you are giving more than receiving, take a look at the relationship. You can decide to not give so much or alternatively, not expect much in return. At some point the negatives outweigh the positives and you can distance yourself from the more draining relationships. That's a realization you have to come to on your own."

politics,f6ajmjz,t1_f6ahh38,1572757838.0,"Well I appreciate the response.  I can't say I've seen such egregious action on the part of the mods. How would you even know unless it's your own posts being censored? I try to remember they are generally volunteers, whether they agree with us or not they've fostered a community where we can have these discussions. So ya know, it's a good thing overall."
CasualConversation,f6ahlj3,t1_f6ae8dd,1572757000.0,"A couple things to tackle here- 1. I did take calculus and I remember fuck all about it. I still don't need to know how to do the math in order to evaluate the veracity of the sources telling me that climate change is real. 2. I can't debunk anything because even if I were the foremost expert in climate science, how am I going to convince Joe Schmoe that the current models suggest we're fucked, especially if he has only a basic understanding of arithmetic 3. I didn't intentionally bring politics into it but Carson is the first person that came into my head- like ooh brain surgeon! Must be super smart!  But for all his actual intelligence, and you're not unintelligent if you're a neurosurgeon, he really is symptomatic of how dumb person can be, even if they have all the facts at hand. 

On the other hand, if I knew how to explain math concepts to Joe Schmoe and not become enraged refuting his flat earth/global cooling/lizard people world view, then perhaps we could progress as a society. 

Anyway, thanks for the convo. Cheers"

politics,f6aesxi,t1_f6a6vgb,1572755851.0,Genuine question- are the mods here pro trump in your opinion? I hate the fucking guy and most stuff I see on r/politics is anti-trump so idk that they'd be removing that stuff. I'm curious now
CasualConversation,f6abu5u,t1_f6a68zj,1572754671.0,"Going on one example, you don't need to know how linear regression works in order to understand that climate change is a real phenomena though. What you need is critical thinking skills. Stuffing formulas and facts into a person's head doesn't achieve that. 

Ben Carson is a neurosurgeon and the guy is a freaking idiot. I'm not the person you replied to but I don't think teaching calculus for the sake of it does much good, on societal level at the least, and on personal level for most."
GoRVing,f6aac3o,t1_f621ysv,1572754093.0,"I did misunderstand. I thinks it's a good idea and obviously I think it's a need but you should post this as a separate question to the community. 

I can't help myself because at present I have an inherited pop-up so I don't have much input on RVs or TTs. My BIL is upgrading soon, and in a few years we will too, which is why I was looking for more consolidated info. I've been told to ask specific question or look to other sites🤷🏼‍♀️ So there you have it. Thanks"

CasualConversation,f6a6r1o,t1_f6a2ogx,1572752687.0,"Yes! I wish liberal arts was really more life arts. Like finance/economics, macro and micro, along with accounting, history and modern implications, critical reading/critical thought, psychosocial adaption to life stressors, vetting media sources/usage of same etc. 

Theres so much life stuff that young adults just don't know while their heads are getting crammed with facts like- when was the Battle of Hastings? Who was the first to circumnavigate the globe? Not that those facts are unimportant but they are less important than learning how to navigate modern society.

Parents should be able to provide most of these skills but let's be real, they can't or don't.  And off these kids go, degree in hand with absolutely no idea how to manage their real life."

Because who wants a living, breathing repudiation of their choices? And if you were thin, that's what you would be.  Sounds like your ma has some serious problems that manifest themselves in an eating disorder. Maybe. Or maybe not, I don't know you. I'm glad you've decided to make healthier choices though"

It wasn't necessary but it was a requirement. I did well/ok in them but at the cost of about one semester's worth of tuition for something I'll never actually use. So, why?"
