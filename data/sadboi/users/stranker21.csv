CodeGeass,fp8sntx,t3_gc1xib,1588401676.0,"The characters are ordered in each tier. I haven’t watched Akito the exiled, so I didn’t include any characters from there in this list.

Lelouch gets his own tier. He is my favorite character in media, so he’s more than earned it.

A tier is where I put the characters who I consider my favorite (besides Lelouch).

B tier is where I put characters I really liked due to their growth (Kallen and Nina) or their characterization (Anya and Nunnally). Edit: Cecile would go here right after Nunnally if the tiermaker had her.

C tier is where I put the characters I don’t have strong opinions of. I don’t hate any of them, but I can’t justify putting them in the higher tiers.

As for the bottom tier, I can’t stand any of those pricks. Suzaku is the one I feel the most personal hatred for, but when I considered the actions of those below him, I couldn’t justify putting them above him.

Please remember that these are my own opinions, and if yours are any different that’s fine. I feel like I’ve seen a lot of character debates around here recently (hell I’ve been a part of some), and they can get pretty heated. I’d like to avoid that here."
