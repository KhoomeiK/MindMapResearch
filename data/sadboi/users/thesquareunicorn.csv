For me, hiding behind the anonymity of the internet is somewhat of a comfort. I can read a bunch of opinions without having to feel personally attacked if it comes to that. I've been ruminating on this subject way too much and it has really taken a toll on my self-image and all the progress I made about really owning and advocating mental health and bipolar specifically. I tend to snow ball and make everything a catastrophe. I didn't really want someone to try and solve my personal problem so much as I wanted to practice saying the things I was thinking to see if my line of thinking is close to reality or if I'm getting bogged down in trying to separate myself from the mental illness realm that society has such an issue with.

I actually just got back from seeing my therapist and she agreed that while my experiences are valid (as far as the physical symptoms and the idea of the whole body being connected, all the nervous system stuff, and so on because she's specializes in trauma and was taught many of these things) that I should call it what it is, acknowledge how it affects me, and let other people take it as they like. And if I'm so afraid of judgement, I can do stuff similar to what you said and just brush it off by briefly mentioning a specific symptom like insomnia.

I have a hard time letting go of certain things and I'm sorry if my post was too vague.
