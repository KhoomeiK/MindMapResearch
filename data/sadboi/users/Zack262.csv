amiugly,ex2e0jy,t3_cqyjzd,1565967703.0,Ive seen way worse clear up with age and treatment. That's the only negative i see.  Good advice for anyone is to work on posture and and projecting your voice and speaking clearly.  I'm not saying these are issues but they certainly are for me.  Good luck
depression,ewqi9jv,t3_cpn7ui,1565666742.0,Im right there with you. Gardening is one of the few things that has kept me going.  They've been suffering a bit since my most recent extreme low but plants are resilient so they've already bounced back. Its amazing that we can still find simple things like this to stay positive and strong in this world. My efforts in the garden don't feel for nothing now. Thank you!
SuicideWatch,ewpuhnz,t3_cp2km4,1565649625.0,"Sunday morning I crashed my car in a panicked irrational state. Once I realized I hadn't died I began stepping out in front of a truck. It was still dark and I dont know if they could see me but they didn't slow down.  Something jerked me back right before i stepped out in front. It flew by me just centimetres away from me. I don't know why i didn't go through with it. I think I felt guilt for the people in the vehicle I would have hurt but it's all so fuzzy so I don't really know. As for whatever stigma my family will receive if I go through with it I could honestly care less.  The only people I would feel guilty for hurting would be my sisters, aunt and cousins. I guess i don't really care so much what the execution is or what the consequences are if I die.. The only real guilt I feel is not feeling more guilty for being selfish and not caring. What the hell."

depression,ewg9uye,t3_co56rn,1565377106.0,"My aunt says that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. In my case that'd be true if I wasn't always depressed, but every once in a while for a few weeks at a time I will feel the anxiety, anger, depression, suicidal thoughts ease up or even go away. I dont know if those moments are worth living for but to me I find comfort in the thought that one day the depression might stay away and be manageable. Those moments of bliss do seems to last longer each time too so it seems that I am growing. Maybe you have something similar that can help bring you back down again."
depression,ewg7x43,t3_co5fwo,1565375875.0,"Trust me admitting yourself is much better than being admitted against your will. If you wait until you act on these thoughts and live you will have zero control or say in what happens to you. I'm my experience being taken in against my will always made thing worse, while going in myself were mostly fruitful experiences. Good luck friend and stay strong."

Never lose passion in what you love either. When I lost passion in life that felt like rock bottom. My passion is why I live. It is what helps me remember that I'm not a bad person just going through some tough shit causing me to be someone I'm not. Dont lose that identity. Peace and love friend.

Downside is it doesn't matter how many people agree, it doesn't seem to change anything."
