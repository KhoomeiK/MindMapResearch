I don't think your ""jew"" nose is much of a problem, it's fairly normal to have a bump on your nose and it really doesn't look very bad. Also, calling a widows peak a problem is not fair. It's barely visible and really doesn't detract from your looks.

Now for some actual negatives (positives below, don't worry):
Your eyebrows and eyelashes are barely visible and the former seems weirdly shaped. I'd suggest some makeup for these, just don't overdo it with fake lashes.
Your eyes are very narrow (eyeshape itself).
Your face is overall a bit wide and lacks the v shape many men find attractive.

Now for positives:
Your hair seems well groomed and fits you well.
Your cheekbones make your face look much better.
Your jawline is also well shaped, although not the sharpest ever.
Your forehead is just about right.
Your mouth is also well shaped and fits in well with your other features.
From the front your nose would make many jealous as it is very even and thin.

I'm only trying to be constructive here, so I'll give you a rundown. The only true way to lose weight is to eat less. It's as simple as calories in minus calories out. So if you want to lose weight you're simply going to have to be a bit hungry for a while, never eating until you're full. The problem in many households is that since the parents often are overweight, their habits make their kids also add weight. If you want to track your calories to be sure that you're doing good, I'd recommend an app like yazio or lifesum. They allow you to add the foods you eat so you know how many calories you've eaten. As for food made at home, just estimate how much you've eaten and use the foods labeled homemade to make it decently accurate. Good luck man!"
