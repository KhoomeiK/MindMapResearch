Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,evelk4i,t3_cjlhyo,1564470565.0,I used to have chronic panic attacks. I was hospitalized a few times from some pretty servere ones and although meds helped a little they never fixed the problem completely. Years of therapy twice a week and a ton of hard work has reduced the frequency of panic attacks to 0. I owe my life to therapy and the mindfulness excersizes I practice. Anxiety and depression are still problems and navigating life isn't always easy but it's nothing compared to how it used to be before I took my mental health seriously. Good luck to you on your own path to wellness.
