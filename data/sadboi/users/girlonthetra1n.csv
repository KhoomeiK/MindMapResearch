EatingDisorders,f1f1rq1,t3_d90x1s,1569435207.0,"I've gotten this before as well.  Mostly from clueless people who say things like, ""I wish I could starve myself-- I can't stop eating!"" Even my mother has said things along the lines of wishing to be anorexic.  I know it hurts, but they don't realize. People are ignorant. However, I think they are likely facing their own difficulties with body image whether you think they fit a diagnosis or not. Individuals handle things in very different ways and self-image is a complicated matter. They see you as the epitome of what they want to be likely, which is wrong of course since you have an eating disorder. I think maybe letting them know that it hurts you the next time they say something like that would make a difference and if they are good friends they will stop.   
Best of luck to you, though. I hope you are able to recover and find peace in your body <3"
