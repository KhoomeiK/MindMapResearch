I'm just waiting for all this crappy relationship stuff to die down once and for all. I really hope that we can work out in the future, but you're right about how she's really manipulative. She basically tried to belittle me for an hour straight in texts and get me to go off on her, but I wouldn't do it. For some reason not going off on her made her even more mad, so she got more emotionally abusive and took to more direct insults. It really sucks because my best friend has a permanent grudge against me now because of how I treated her even though nothing I did was intentional and I had no bad intentions with her or anyone else.

I'm still debating going out with her, but there's a lot of extra details as to why I probably shouldn't date her. Some examples: she dated two of my close friends and she went off on me (I don't have a problem with that. Not at all, I actually deserved it, but she was very manipulative and toxic about everything, so it's not the same as a traditional „I hate you“)"

It started when I had my first gf, and we were somewhat happy, but I was overthinking the whole thing. It got so bad that I began taking pills to forget about the situation. The first day it wasn't so bad, but then the second day it got significantly worse. Anyway, I broke up with her around this time, and I took about 60 pills and I drank a bottle of cough syrup, so I was basically drunk. I was drunk after I broke up with her, and I decided to text her whole drunk. I told her to forget that we broke up and that I loved her and that we should still be dating and a whole lot of other stuff like that. We even called and according to her I didn't say anything to her other than „I can't feel my face“ and „I love you.“ Also, I have 0 memory of what happened while I was drunk, so when I woke up I thought everything was good. I even forgot that I broke up with her, so I went to text her good morning, and that's when I saw the messages. After reading them for about an hour or so, I regained some of my memories and I remembered breaking up with her and stuff. I tried to explain that I was drunk and I didn't mean anything I said to her, but she still wanted to date me (God knows why). 

And yeah, that's basically the short of the story. There's still a lot of other stuff that happened afterwards, but I'll keep it somewhat short"

If a loser like me can succeed at it then maybe you'll have a good shot at it too. Also, I can lend some o my stories to you if you'd like to read them if you want to pick up reading as a hobby, or maybe you are a good critiquer and you can effortlessly point out all the flaws in my books

I changed schools to make my parents happy, because I'm at a school that's really big on education. Anyways, I can't keep up with all the work, because I have a lot of mental health issues (it was dumb to even go there). I found a girl who I really like at the school and I really need to go to a hospital for my mental health. I don't want to leave the girl, but I really need to check out my mental health. Exams are this week, but the girl also told me that she loves me dearly. I'm really fucked and I feel like either way will fuck me over, however (this is the part that will probably help) I talked to the girl and she's fine with me going and doesn't seem to have a problem with it. In conclusion, try and speak to your friend and tell her that you really can't deal with the area as a whole. Make it a genuine conversation and get it all out there, and then if she throws your mental health under the bus and says something like “deal with it” then you should just leave her.
