I don’t eat dinner with the family anymore because I don’t want to deal with my sister. And I’m unfortunately unable to hold a job due to a medical condition. That’s why my sister moved in with us to basically hound me until I am forced to move out. And I don’t think my parents see much of a problem with this."

Getting him to quit playing video games is very important. When I stopped playing games I became a lot more of a person. I am not angry, aggressive, dismissive or impatient anymore since I've quit gaming.
