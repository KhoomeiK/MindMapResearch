I will never forget my last host. The real struggle is that the original occupant of that body never even got an opportunity to reflect on being possessed, truly ruining whatever life they would have lived, but I must say, I made their observed life by all the others an entertaining one, fulfilling, and eccentric. Many people were hurt because of it but the contrast was the plethora who benefited from witnessing such a life. There were only a handful of lives in which I embodied for the entire duration, drifting off to another mortal after their passing; those brief periods of drifting are quite devastating. If you choose to pursue *ghost* after death than all you have left between living these pseudo-lives are the false memories of those who've you stolen and the actual one you most realistically lived in the beginning, which is now blending into all the others; its a world of forgetfulness, depression, and despair; a crisp bow of Dante's circles all seen and lived out in a concentrated manner, metaphorically, through a groundhog's day format. After that last life I lived out, and most fully of all of them, for him, the many accomplishments and legacy leftover, but the constant guilt of robbing these mortals lives now haunts me, forever-- as a now immortal, guilt-ridden house cat.
