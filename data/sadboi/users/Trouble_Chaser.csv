Not sure about if he has pain or not, but I found I needed to be vigilant about pain management and my mental health as for a few years after I broke my spine it was so easy to slip into depression and give up on my independence. 

Not sure what physio you have available but I did one that wasn't only exercises, but held classes included with my fee on biology and lifestyle that really helped empower me."

Also they require some math and while I am great at math if I write it down but I'm strugle to do math without doing something with my hands, I've caught myself using my fingers while playig these games which is super embarassing.

I met my wife in 2009 playing World of Warcraft. She lived in the mid west I lived on the west coast of Canada. We did long distance for a few years and it was a challenge. Video calls, texts, sending each other hand written letters and drawings helped. 
It took a great deal of patience and lots of communication and honesty. We didn't get a chance to live together before we got married, which was a bit scary, but it made immigration much easier. There is an adjustment period when going from distance to living together. 
As of today we both live in Canada and are happily married, it was worth the heartache and loneliness during the distance."

I think of the best things I think I did was ask questions about him and listen. Giving her an easy chance to bring up thoughts, feeling and memories. I also encouraged her to go to counseling, just anything to give her a good support network through this all.

relationship_advice,fmuzgam,t3_fxjb04,1586402386.0,"Hey I saw your questions in the comments as to changing your mindset towards gaming I thought I would point out some stuff to you that is positive about games.

Have you ever looked at video games as a form of art that not only interaction but pass/fail challenges to even experience all of it. 

Firstly the art with virtually any game you are looking at this incredible group art project. You have folks creating character models, designing settings, making music, choosing colour pallets, writing scripts and story lines. So your boyfriend is taking in all this artistic effort without you folks having to worry about catch Covid in an art gallery or theatre.  I saw you mentioned a Switch, I highly recommend checking out some screenshots of Yoshi's Willy World, the creativity in the game design is incredible. Also there are Orchestral tours for video game music, I took my wife to a pokemon one a couple years ago and it was great to see folks who might not normally attend an Orchestra be there because of the music.

Video games have a challenge and engagement that isn't often demanded of us in say when reading a book, the book and isn't going to demand something of me to move the protagonist forward in the story. Some games demand a test of reflexes others want you to solve a puzzles and others entire military strategies or marriage alliances to set up dynasties, check out videos on Crusader Kings 2 for some crazy deep games of the fuedal system.  

Also how about physics and math! Many games have physics engines in them and some games are entirely based on solving puzzles or moving through them based on the physics. Also many games give your strength in different statistics and those statistics get applied to equipment or items in game and people with spend ages cracking down the numbers and comparing them to other numbers in games in order to increase their effectiveness.  

I'm not sure what games your boyfriend is into, but I hope this helps give you more perspective on them."

There are many places where women don't get the ability to choose for themselves. Hey Morgan a little thought experiment, let's pretend that it became the law that you could not vote or speak about government stuff and lets pretend that  Darmarah - god of war and glory (from my DnD game I don't want to drag real religions in to this) is the official religion and you have to follow it.

In my case my players love exploring and rping so they end up filling in the cast majority of the details for me while I add those story beats to their work.  

Not every group is like this but we've been playing for about 20 years now so it works. There are 3 of us who generally rotate in DMing, two of us light prep and one of us really likes to write pages and pages of notes and scripts. 20 years on and the one of us who loves prepping all the details I can feel their frustration sometimes when things go very unexpectedly and hear the train coming when we spend longer than they prepared on a scene.

It takes just the lightest touch to get the scratches. There are honestly times where I have to brush 2 or 3 times in order to make contact since I am trying to keep my touch so light.

Compared to snorting pox scabs of having pus from poxes smeared on flesh a nice sterile needle seems downright heavenly. Vaccinations are one of the few things humans actually clued onto far earlier than other practices. It honestly breaks my heart to know the lengths people in past and currently in places where they are not as available have to go to to get a vaccine. 

This is the ultimate in selfishness, pride, and ignorance. I'm not a believer but if hypothetically Jesus existed and healed folks and looked out for the less fortunate I would love to know his take on the people who put at risk the most vulnerable of us, kids and sick folks who can't be vaccinated. 

I had spine surgery a few years ago and in the hospital I caught an antibacterial resistant form of C-diff, a superbug. It took me a couple of years to shake, in that time I avoided any physical contact with my older and sicker relatives for fear of spreading it. I didn't want to put someone at risk for my own desires. I wanted to see my Nana but she had just had heart surgery and I've known a few old folks to be killed by such infections, thank goodness she is around post infection.
