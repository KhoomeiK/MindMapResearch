bipolar,fiosgz6,t3_f8vs3p,1582589931.0,"(Trigger Warning: Abuse/Suicide)

Yes.  All of my immediate family.  I currently have a ‚Äúcircle of support‚Äù, which is my husband, my therapist, and my best friend.  My mom and dad are so close-minded about mental health in general.  I attempted suicide at the end of December, and my mom won‚Äôt even say I did it, probably because she doesn‚Äôt want it to be true and she‚Äôs ashamed.  I went from being a symphony cellist and renowned wedding photographer who ignored her symptoms for years, resulting in a complete suicidal mental breakdown, and now I‚Äôm a husk.  I‚Äôve got nothing left.  And they still don‚Äôt realize that I‚Äôm sick.
I‚Äôm the only girl of 3 boys, and I never felt like I got the affection and love they got.
Growing up, I never felt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.  I felt more sad than most.  One of my brothers had anger problems and would beat the living shit out of me... but he‚Äôs the one that got the help and therapy and attention.  The other two were drugged up/drunk, pissing on the dishwasher, lighting things in fire, and stabbing swords through the doors.  My dad had the same anger problems as my brother, and, again, I was the target.  He destroyed every major event I had growing up: slapped me across the face right before I went on stage for a cello performance, tried to kill me by pushing me down the basement stairs on the day of my prom, and several holidays were destroyed.  When I wanted to call the cops because I‚Äôd had enough of the abuse, my mom told me not to because it would destroy THEIR futures.  My home was a fucking war zone 99% of the time.  Holes in walls, broken furniture, and dirty.  I was told to go hide in my room until the fighting stopped.  I always wonder what it would have been like if she actually listened to how I felt and got me some help when I was younger.
After I attempted suicide in December, my mom was ENRAGED that I told the doctor I didn‚Äôt want her to come into the hospital room when they were fixing me up.  She couldn‚Äôt understand why I didn‚Äôt want her there.  When my husband told her not to come back, she and my dad left.  Went out to dinner.
So, they‚Äôre officially gone.  My dad comes around every now and again, but my mom is too self-absorbed to pay attention to anyone around her.  My husband is phenomenal, knows all of my triggers/warning signs, but I know that he can‚Äôt do it all, which is why I go to therapy, and so does he.  My best friend grounds me by bringing me back to good times.  My therapist is a godsend.  She had no room for anymore patients, but decided to squeeze me into her day because she wanted to help.
If I didn‚Äôt have them, I‚Äôd already be gone."
