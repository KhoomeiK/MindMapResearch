EatingDisorders,fpm5s3e,t1_fplxqv5,1588726142.0,"I will be frank. Insurance companies do not like to approve residential. With the current covid stuff I don’t know if they are admitting, but there are lots of places and you can apply to go to one directly with the facility.  Unless you are court ordered, your psychiatrist can’t keep you from going.  You can literally call one up have them review your case and go if insurance approves it.  However, even if you go residential, you will probably go to php in the future.  My daughter went to several and a few really sucked. If the php you are doing is bad go to another.  Battling ED is hard and unfortunately you have to fight the system on top of it.  I am going to tell you something very important: Get a therapist or psychiatrist that specializes in eating disorders.  Most of them do not know how to treat ED and can make things worse. Call the Eating Recover Center in Denver.  Best place we ever went.  My insurance ended up covering most of her stay after she ended up in the ICU because her heart was erratic due to her purging.  They must have decided inpatient was cheaper than ICU. Don’t give up. You can do this. For the mean time tell your counselors at php how you are helping and give them a chance to make things right."

I get that  mutual faith in the currency is all that it takes to establish it as having value or not.  I think people assumed I was slandering the Fed, I was not.  I just couldn't think of anyone else that creates money to compare them to. If counterfitters were backed by congress and did their money production via adding numbers to bank accounts then it would be more similar. My real point is still the little realized fact that the Fed creates money by adding credit to its member banks' deposits. What's being added is not being subtracted from anywhere else.
