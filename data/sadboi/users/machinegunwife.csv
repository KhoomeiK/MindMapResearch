I hope if you're engaging in sexual acts at this time in your life that you're mature enough to communicate what you want.

If it becomes too much, if you don't like where you work, etc luckily you don't have to stay there at the end of the day, so don't be scared if you can't handle it. You may not be ready yet and that's ok we all move at a different pace and you will find a job eventually that is a perfect fit for you."

TrueOffMyChest,fp29tcn,t1_fp1ps6d,1588257945.0,Yeah OP is pretty much stereotyping rap as a whole I couldn't read after that
conspiracy,fozfen4,t1_foze5tw,1588189741.0,"If the number of pedophiles and rapists that abuse others are statistically related to them also being abused then it would be fair to say that anybody who is sexually abused has a chance at becoming this type of monsters themselves and I just don't think that's true. I don't think the variables are related to each other.

I think that's too easy.

It's downright a moral thing. If you rape someone, you can't blame that on being sick or having something wrong with your brain because you directly chose to violate someone sexually. There is no instance where anybody should force themselves on somebody else, unlike say if you kill somebody there could be a reason for doing it like defending yourself from being killed or something like that.

Just because you've been sexually abused doesn't make someone do it someone else in any circumstance. Edit: I guarantee these types of people would still be rapists even if they weren't sexually abused themselves.

Even if they were related it doesn't even excuse it. Just because somebody hurt you doesn't mean you hurt somebody else. To the electric with ya!"

conspiracy,foz0d7k,t1_foyfmcc,1588182492.0,Idk I was raped as a teen and it doesn't make me want to rape other people so I don't think abuse is the root cause of anyone doing that shit... Makes no sense to me

Then to be honest, I don't know why you're posting here. I don't think this sub exists to validate people, I think it's for support and a safe place for victims to come and seek help. I think it's wrong for you to come here and send the wrong message that someone should be able to stay with their rapist in a potentially dangerous situation.

I would advise you to seek help, and therapy."

rape,fooksoe,t1_fooiu7v,1587940947.0,I came here to second this comment. Props to the enforcement handling your report OP! I'm really glad they found someone because now maybe you can gain some peace of mind while having also helped save another possible victim. Good luck OP.
