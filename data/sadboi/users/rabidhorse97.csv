My friend who I was supposed to stay with messaged me saying that they may be moving back to the mainland before I get there. You mentioned tourism won‚Äôt be back by then.

insaneparents,fomdocd,t3_g7zpml,1587886298.0,"Hey OP. just wanted to chime in and say I feel for you. I have a severe dissociative disorder due to abuse from around that age too, as well as ptsd and a slew of other things. I know how challenging it is finding someone trained/experienced in traumas. It‚Äôs literally like none of them are and as a result you cant get any help. I finally found someone who works for me after some seriously long and hard searching. It‚Äôs hard stuff. Awful stuff. However getting help once I found it is the best thing I‚Äôve ever done for myself, even though I questioned it a lot and it was extremely difficult for me due to the nature of everything. I say this because I truly hope you can find someone too. I‚Äôm still growing, still healing. It‚Äôll never be perfect for us but it gets better and more manageable. I don‚Äôt abuse substances anymore since I‚Äôve gotten help and things have become more stable. 

My mother is diagnosed bipolar and my dad NPD and a scary man. She was abused growing up too. It‚Äôs like they pass it on. Growing up in that environment with these kind of people with your own afflictions and traumas is a nightmare. I‚Äôve had similar problems you‚Äôre having with your step father with my dad. Good on you for saying you‚Äôll take him to court. I wish I had your strength. I can‚Äôt even think about it without my skin crawling and me borderline almost puking because of the violation and disgust. I hope you never have to see that disgusting man again. And I hope your mother will stop living in denial about what happened, but if she‚Äôs anything like mine, she won‚Äôt. These people are all the same. 

Take care and message me if you ever want to talk to someone who gets what you experience and have lived through. We‚Äôre stronger than them. 

I truly wish and hope for the best for you. Here‚Äôs to us"

I don‚Äôt get how people live in such a bubble where they think this is weird. When you‚Äôre nice and accepting of everyone, you find your friend group broadens drastically. 
Also, this guy is like family. I work with him and am founding a nonprof with him as well. There‚Äôs no implication here and not any of her business or concern at the end of the day. Shit if I wanted to go date some 40 y.o. I could and she still wouldn‚Äôt be entitled to speak to me like this, because again, none of her business or concern. I‚Äôm too old for this.

My mom, since i was 13, has been calling me a prostitute and a whore and hopes I end up raped and overdosed on a sidewalk (she said that exact sentence when I was 16) because ‚Äúit‚Äôs what I deserve‚Äù. For having male friends. 
I don‚Äôt do drugs, I have a beer once a month, I work 50 hour weeks and put myself through school, and last time I hooked up with someone was months ago, and before that even months more. 
Also, I‚Äôm 23. Lol. 
She later called me to scream at me because she thinks I was actually at a gentlemen‚Äôs club, and not a boat. Full of friends. 
She‚Äôs extremely mentally unstable. Used to tell me when I was a kid that if I wake up and find her wrists slit in a pool of her blood, that it was my fault. I was around 9 when she said that. 
She also had cancer a couple years back and somehow convinced herself I gave it to her (???) and that I was possessed by a demon for listening to rob zombie. She looked into having an exorcism done on me when I was in highschool. 
Fun stuff :) saving up to move out and rent a room somewhere this summer

Edit: I also did in fact stay with my married friends when on vacation, so I wouldn‚Äôt have to pay for a hotel. Don‚Äôt know why I would lie about that. Don‚Äôt know why it matters.

AskDID,f3t8123,t1_f3t7q2v,1571121935.0,okay that makes me feel a bit better. i guess it makes sense that it would be more obvious to me as opposed to other people. i relistened to the video and it‚Äôs not as ‚Äúextremely apparent‚Äù as i had initially feared. im still learning about my system and i just get worried and nervous sometimes.
AskDID,f3t6yft,t1_f3t6t9a,1571120742.0,ahhh yeah i‚Äôm worried they‚Äôll pick up on switches :( no one in my life‚Äôs knows about this so i‚Äôm afraid of them confronting me and accusing me of attention seeking or something :(

schizophrenia,f3t1xyy,t1_f3sqt7n,1571115597.0,i didn‚Äôt take it as them giving medical advice just giving their experience
wowthanksimcured,f3ru3jr,t1_f3rby8d,1571091886.0,omg this was my exact same situation with one of my friends too. he later admitted he didn‚Äôt know anything about schizophrenia but proceeded to tell me i didn‚Äôt need meds and that it was all in my head. so frustrating!!
AskDID,f3ghpvi,t1_f3gcyjr,1570911407.0,"how could you possibly know the situations are literally different when they didn‚Äôt tell you their situation? for all you know they‚Äôre the exact same. i‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre trying to help, but you‚Äôre not going to get better advice than what the people here are telling you, considering most everyone here has DID/OSDD and severe trauma, just like your girlfriend. 

it‚Äôs not suspicious of her alters, since they are the ones who protect her and manage everything. listen to them and don‚Äôt reveal anything to her. it‚Äôs good that they are comfortable enough and trust you enough to talk about this with you, but if you go behind their backs and tell her what they‚Äôve said, you will not only hinder her healing process, you will cause great distress and turmoil which will affect the others as well, and you will damage what seems like a good relationship with them, and they probably will not trust you again when you‚Äôve gone against their wishes and (though your intentions are good) hurt the host. 

let them do their work. let her heal. they know what is best for your girlfriend right now, and they have been doing this and protecting her since they came into this world- you haven‚Äôt. trust them. also, i am sorry all this has happened, i hope she never has to go through that kind of conversation or contact with him again. how vile of him. i wish you both the best and i hope the healing process goes as smoothly for her as possible. cheers"
MadeOfStyrofoam,f2zc6n6,t3_detftq,1570514304.0,i‚Äôve been clean for 1.5 but holy shit right now i‚Äôm coming real damn close to breaking. hope you were able to hang in there
schizophrenia,f2upcux,t1_f2un7t0,1570423553.0,"i start my new medication tonight, i‚Äôm just not feeling very hopeful because this will be the third one i‚Äôve tried, and i‚Äôm just so tired of it and wish i could snap my fingers and make it all go away. the other two didn‚Äôt work for me, made me feel horrendous. third times the charm though. that‚Äôs a good point i‚Äôve literally never considered the fact that i can‚Äôt actually get back there. but here‚Äôs to hoping for the best, hope you have a good rest of your night"
schizophrenia,f2umuov,t1_f2umiia,1570421066.0,"not a bad idea actually, thank you for the suggestion. i think a full face helmet could be beneficial, man i just wish i could stop the pain"
schizophrenia,f2umg5e,t1_f2umdtg,1570420687.0,"oh shit i‚Äôm sorry i haven‚Äôt done that before, is there a flair for that? i‚Äôll edit my post to add it if it helps"
schizophrenia,f2ulwz6,t1_f2ullra,1570420201.0,"yeah it‚Äôs horrible and out of all of my hallucinations this is one of the ones i genuinely physically fear the most because of the amount of physical pain it causes me, i have other hallucinations that are absolutely petrifying but this one just straight up HURTS. i‚Äôm starting my new meds tonight, hopefully they work. but just watch, every time i get better (thanks to meds) i convince myself i‚Äôm not sick and then get off my meds, relapse, and the cycle continues. like i said, this affliction is sadistic. i hope the pain from yours subsides as well, thanks for the kind words. hoping for the best for both of us"
schizophrenia,f2ukt0t,t1_f2hmmju,1570419262.0,"i often feel a bug burrowed under my left eye. i‚Äôll be able to feel it moving and digging it‚Äôs claws into my eye. it hurts so fuckin bad, then i start panicking and try to dig it out for like 45 minutes, until my eye is leaking that mucus shit and it‚Äôs swollen shut and in a bunch of pain. then the bug just digs in harder until i break down crying and have to wrap my eye up to keep me from blinding myself

i fucking hate schizophrenia man, honestly out of all my disorders, schizo is the one that‚Äôs like an entity of its own. it‚Äôs sadistic"
schizophrenia,f2ukfak,t3_ddme34,1570418956.0,"yeah, i‚Äôve been diagnosed three times and they are convinced the psychiatrists are lying/not well trained enough and that i‚Äôm googling symptoms to act them out in an attempt to gain ‚Äúpathetic attention‚Äù lol. you‚Äôre not alone"
insaneparents,f26bh0j,t1_f26bacs,1570001664.0,"it is and i have a lot of fucked issues because of things they‚Äôve subjected me to since i popped out, but i‚Äôve grown to be a much better person than they could ever hope to be. i‚Äôm moving into an apartment of my own in the spring, though it‚Äôs getting difficult because they keep demanding my hard earned money from me because they are unemployed/broke. oh well. here‚Äôs to baby steps moving forward, cheers to better days"
insaneparents,f269xcn,t3_dbuqa9,1569999718.0,"my mom did this in highschool, if i remember correctly i think it was because i left dirty laundry in my room? or something like that. 

i was allowed to have three shirts (she intentionally made them ugly and unflattering to try to get students to bully me so i‚Äôd ‚Äúlearn‚Äù) one pair of jeans, and worn down sneakers. i wasn‚Äôt allowed to have a door in my room, they took it down. was allowed to have one blanket on my bed, they ripped down and threw out any posters or art i had made that were hanging on my wall. my phone only worked 3 hours a day, and if i didn‚Äôt call them the second i got to school, she would try to call the police on me. (i lived a 5 min walk away from school). wasn‚Äôt allowed to see friends for like 4-5 months. had to wash my three shirts and one pair of jeans in the bathtub. 

i was already suicidal at the time, so this was the last straw so i tried to kms because i was already so depressed and miserable. when they found out, my dad physically abused me and called me a pussy and choked me and smashed my head into the wall till i was almost unconscious to ‚Äúfinish what i started‚Äù, because apparently i was too much of a pussy to kill myself correctly. 

the other day i had to sleep in my car, which i own, instead of my room, which i rent from them, because i accidentally fucked up and left a single spoon in the sink

phewwwwwww this post brought back a lot of shitty memories. can‚Äôt wait till i never have to see these people again :,)"
trippinthroughtime,f237ls8,t1_f1sej1a,1569909442.0,"just getting back to you cause they didn‚Äôt, i think they were making a joke :) the entire book is about going to hell lol
or maybe you understood and i‚Äôm just behind on this entire interaction, which is a good possibility lol"
AskDID,f235frj,t3_dbnz73,1569906815.0,"YES it‚Äôs one of the most apparent signs to me that someone decided to confront/come in and out of the front or whatever you call it. 

i get a whole rush over my limbs and body, or get lightheaded and confused for a few, sometimes i‚Äôll feel really heavy after. the rush is like getting energy based chills, if that makes sense. sometimes my head feels heavy like i‚Äôm literally sharing it. i‚Äôve been trying to pay more attention to it and when/how often it happens, catching trends. i can pretty much always physically feel it though, and i‚Äôm just like ope okay here we go. i always just cofront though. never fully black out that i‚Äôm aware of, though i will lose entire massive gaps of time and memory of my day when someone was cofronting at the same time. that gets real frustrating 

or i‚Äôll get a heavy sense of detachment, like me or someone else is sinking into my body. i hate it"
DID,f1leikt,t1_f1l9q39,1569552665.0,"thanks for the kind response. i‚Äôm sorry you have to worry about this at work too. it‚Äôs so frustrating.  i‚Äôm so exhausted from trying to maintain a face and persona. it completely drains me and steals my days from me. i had no idea what was going just now. i‚Äôve only recently (in the past few months) learned we‚Äôre a system and how to tell when they co-front, so everything is still sort of ?????? what‚Äôs going on. i will try to see if i can remember a trigger 

unfortunately i don‚Äôt think i can tell my boss, it‚Äôs such a small company and there‚Äôs so few of us that it would make things uncomfortably close. i will consider telling him if it continues to get worse though, just so maybe they can understand a bit

i just wish i could be better at maintaining one constant face and persona. i‚Äôm so exhausted all the time. it gets so hard and embarrassing. thanks for the kindness, hope things get a bit easier for you and that you have a good rest of your night"
