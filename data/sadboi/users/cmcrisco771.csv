MurderedByWords,fqhddnm,t3_givuyi,1589374550.0,SOME Americans. Not all.
Borderlands,fory2sf,t3_g98mor,1588020523.0,I totally agree mayhem 10 is busted but honestly I would rather just try my luck and go for amazing mayhem 10 loot rather than farm mayhem 6 stuff that I will inevitably throw away when they fix the drop rates.
borderlands3,fok42dx,t1_fojwv5k,1587835020.0,Ah unlucky with the annoint but great for getting an actual mayhem 10 one!
borderlands3,fojvn3f,t3_g7ua7a,1587830323.0,Try r/Borderlands3Exchange
borderlands3,fojvejq,t3_g7ujcj,1587830187.0,Yeah it can become almost unplayable sometimes.
borderlands3,fojva3j,t1_fojpsou,1587830114.0,For sure. Sometimes you can kill him and not get any legendaries. Kind of annoying.
borderlands3,fojv12v,t3_g7uw1n,1587829968.0,Got a m10 one with 100 percent cryo at 32k its nuts
borderlands3,fojuya5,t3_g7uxl3,1587829922.0,Can confirm the lob is still good. Got a mayhem 10 one with 100 cryo and it pumps out damage like a mad man.
borderlands3,fojtzu9,t1_fojtwra,1587829355.0,Ah yeah I see what you mean that farm took me quite some time
borderlands3,fojtxrh,t3_g7v76a,1587829321.0,If you want easy mode I would look up chain zane on YouTube. Basically invincible while also being able to mob and boss very easily.
borderlands3,fojtqo1,t1_fojtcrw,1587829203.0,If you mean like dedicated drops I'm pretty sure nothing effects the rate at which they drop. But yeah you're way more likely to get world drops from enemies in the specified locations.
borderlands3,fojtjya,t3_g7vdsk,1587829092.0,Can't confirm but I assume not since it isn't active
borderlands3,fohdyof,t1_fohcunq,1587764348.0,You are spot on. I would also suggest farming for the x2 variant of the recursion. That combined with the spiritual driver will put out the damage you are wanting. Would recommend shooting it at the healthiest enemy in a group to do the most damage.
borderlands3,fohdfei,t3_g7gu2q,1587764099.0,If you want videos of where each gun is and a little bit about it then check out Kody McHugh on YouTube. He has guides for every gun in the game.
Borderlands3Exchange,foh99pc,t1_foh90rb,1587762154.0,If only it could roll like that legit lmao
Borderlands3Exchange,foh8u2s,t1_foh8kpd,1587761955.0,What he said. From what I understand a mod only having 2 stats means one of the stats rolled twice which can't happen in game. Unless I'm mistaken.
Borderlands,fofatjd,t1_fod5x3r,1587731428.0,Yeah that should do it as the event isn't online you just need to download it.
Borderlands,fofanux,t1_fofafhr,1587731302.0,Yeah looks like bossing is not the move right now. Was getting far more from just mobbing with the event.
Borderlands,fofag64,t3_g6tbsw,1587731131.0,Happening to me as well. Hopefully a bug as its supposed to be 2500 percent loot drops.
Borderlands,fofa6sk,t3_g755rk,1587730922.0,Yeah I farmed graveward last night and would get between 0-2 legendaries per run. It was very odd and they would be trash. It used to be between 2-5. At least it felt like that on m4.
Borderlands,fof9uke,t3_g6ufpg,1587730646.0,Yeah happened to me too. If you are playing with friends and they don't have any issues have them host. Its what fixed it for me.
Borderlands,fof9o1p,t3_g6y9io,1587730498.0,Yeah thats been an issue for me since they buffed it. Put an entire clip into an enemy and nothing happens.
Borderlands,fof9gtr,t3_g6zlp1,1587730332.0,Mine was like that when I played coop with some buddies. I would have to exit to the main menu to play normally again. It was only me though.
LifeProTips,fof5h2w,t3_g711f1,1587726713.0,Not sure why but basically every time I get sad enough to the point where I'm about to cry it feels like my emotions just shut off and I don't really feel anything for a while. I don't think its normal but its what happens.
nextfuckinglevel,fo4ilob,t3_g5dhix,1587505086.0,Dude is about to have a stroke lol but yeah 100 percent agree with what he said.
NoStupidQuestions,fo2l75e,t3_g53sze,1587466576.0,I get these very often. I find just massaging the cramped muscle and slowing closing your mouth to be effective.

NorthCarolina,flhw8cb,t3_fooq1z,1585170656.0,I honestly think that the shelter in place order should be left up to the counties as some of them have no confirmed cases. However I do think they should restrict travel to and from different counties to keep the spreading down.

loseit,fl3wjh0,t3_fmccv9,1584800233.0,For me I weighed about 250 and lost 30 pounds by just eating less. I still ate the same crappy food I just would order less of it. So maybe that could be a decent place to start. I've always been told making significant changes to your diet is a lot harder to maintain than making small adjustments over time. Also I drank a lot of soda as well so if you do the same I would recommend cutting back on it a bit as well. A lot of empty calories there.
PublicFreakout,fkxfc4g,t1_fkxaexf,1584626900.0,Jokes on them I've been hoarding eggs for years in preparation for this.
WeightLossAdvice,fkxetys,t3_fl70mk,1584626567.0,I have the exact same issue. I won't eat all day cause I'm just not hungry and then around 9 I just start binging.
NorthCarolina,fkhljii,t1_fkhjlt1,1584201379.0,Thanks! I think you're right after googling some pics it does look like it.
NorthCarolina,fkhg2q0,t3_fijlq2,1584197961.0,It is all throughout my mom's lawn and I just wanted to see if anyone knew what it was and how to get rid of it. She has two dogs who like to eat grass so a pet friendly solution would be very helpful. Thanks!
pokemongo,fjnzjvt,t1_fjngwjs,1583517489.0,Well said.
Vaping101,fjlcav2,t1_fjlc02v,1583444078.0,Agreed. Better safe than sorry. I would rather my wallet be a bit lighter rather than having the batteries explode on me.

Borderlands,fj6m4tb,t1_fj6eg5h,1583075311.0,Coincidentally the dedicated drop for the transformer is killavolt. But it can also drop from any enemy. It's just a higher rate with him.

nosleep,fcfuz29,t3_egrpq5,1577633989.0,Your story really made me pause and think. Me and my ex of 10 years broke up about a year ago and i have been beating myself up about it ever since. Blaming myself and the amazing life i ruined. However she isnt too different than Avery. She was emotionally abusive rather than physical but just as intense. I always brushed it off because when she was happy it was amazing being with her. However when she was upset it was almost unbearable. Now im starting to think maybe a similar situation could have happened to me if we got married and it wouldnt have been as perfect as I would have imagined. Maybe this reality is for the best.
