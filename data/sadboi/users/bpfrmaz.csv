BipolarReddit,fm9go3a,t1_fm8xtvi,1585868360.0,I think the part for me is that nobody really understand what is going on inside. Glad this subreddit exists because it's a beautiful support group we created for each other. I always tell people you can feel how other people are even if their experiences are different. That's why these subreddits work.

But I've been on 200mg of Lamictal for a year, and just recently got it bumped up to 300mg. I've had a really good experience this year knowing that I was able to function properly with only a couple of wobbles along the way. I really hope it works for you! Once you know that you won't get a rash from the meds, everything feels good after that. I don't have any side affects. Hope you feel less nervous about starting itâœŠ"

I don't believe in God but I'm pissed at the idea of a God. It took a while for me to realize that the religion I grew up in is trash and very manipulative. It makes my parents ignorant and judgmental. So yeah, fuck you God. All my praying for healing didn't work until I put all of that aside, that's when I was able to get real help along with resources to get proper mediation."
bipolar,f84dabx,t3_dym456,1574242337.0,"I took my friend out to a nice pizza shop and paid for his meal so I could catch up with him (he didn't have money to spend at this restaurant). I didn't necessarily need to vent to him, but I was having a rough couple of days having my ex play with my emotions. I really just wanted to have a good time and try to pick myself up. As soon as we got our food, he gets a call from his gf telling him to get home because of some drama they were going through or she would drive off somewhere, idk the situation. Well even though he was apologetic, I cried after I dropped him off and went home. I'm good now, just felt empty after that happened. Just finished the pizza, and watched YouTube the rest of the night."

bipolar,f63srkc,t3_dqd798,1572682900.0,"22 M. I was diagnosed as bipolar 1 rapid cycling back in January this year. Ask a lot of questions and do some research online. Whenever I read through this subreddit, I feel like people can understand me rather than make me feel crazy or judged. I've got a great support system, but sometimes it's nice to talk to people that can really understand you. Honestly take everything one step at time, starting with what your doctor tells you to do. Medication takes time to work, but I'm so glad I'm on it. I'm able to see that they work just by the fact that I'm able to function properly. When I'm feeling real depressed, I make sure to come up with an emergency plan for myself just in case I'm wanting to hurt myself.  Sorry things are difficult rn, they will get better. I don't know your story, but maybe try to reach out to your friends or get a change of scenery? Things really do get better, and I'm amazed at my personal progress so far. Hope this helps."
