For the most part she’s neurotypical and even had trouble understanding hearing voices. I mean that I had to walk her through what it’s like to hallucinate outside of my head and hear voices inside several times before she could grasp the concept. She’s very self aware and the only times that she’s ever had any “issues with her memory” the way I do is when we’re trying to discuss what she’s done to me. Which I just believe for the most part is her rewriting the past.

Honestly though it might be possible for reasons I don’t wanna get into, but I don’t think I’ll be able to accept that until I’m away from her as safe. She tries to point out our similarities all the time and I think it’s an attempt to bond with me and make me think that we’re not so different, and the thought of being like her in this way makes me physically nauseous.

If she is a system that would just hurt too much to process."

DID,fq5cqii,t3_ggpbba,1589100409.0,"My ex did this to me. When I was 16, I had a year and 10 months before I was away from my abusers and I hadn’t been in danger with them for awhile. He told me that if I didn’t go to CPS he would. And yeah that seems like it’s caring. But the thing was I already had a plan, I already was getting ready to buy an apartment and go to college, and I was dealing with it in therapy, and my entire team didn’t deem it necessary to alert CPS. 

I did because I had no choice. He also wanted me to go into the foster system even though I didn’t want that. And guess what they told me? “You have a year and 10 months left, you’re not in immediate danger, we’re still gonna do an investigation but it’s your decision how to handle things from here.”

So I had to relive all that trauma and a CPS investigation just because I wasn’t handling my life the way he wanted.

The brain has been literally hiding parts of itself from the people who hurt it, so combine that with the natural distance and secrets when it comes to abuse, and you discover that non of your abusers truly know you at all.

And I know that that seems like such a small thing when you compare it to the hell you’ve gone through to have it in the first place. But to me, it’s wonderful. Because we are nothing like the people who hurt us perceive us to be. And that means that at least in that sense we have the upper hand.

Because we know them. We have entire parts dedicated to knowing them and predicting what they’ll do. I think it’s funny because when they say “I know you better than you know yourself” it’s really the opposite. We know them more than they know themselves and that means that we have the power."

However the ones who are misleading/advertising unsafe practice (i.e. the girl who used rods to communicate with her “boyfriend”) are endangering themselves and potentially others. Some of them have a lot of reach and they could inadvertently put someone who doesn’t know what they’re doing in danger.

With that said, we shouldn’t be as aggressive as I’ve seen others be. If we drive them away, then how are they going to get the right information and fix their mistakes?

Two years later we ran into each other, and he told me that he couldn’t stop thinking about me and that he had to apologize, which isn’t like him (again, it takes a lot for me to admit I was wrong) and even then we only spent time together for a couple weeks. We also had very similar childhoods/relationships/lives in general. And even now I still think about him. I still remember that pull and I still feel it sometimes, too.
