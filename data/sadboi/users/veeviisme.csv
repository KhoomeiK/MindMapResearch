Get to know yourself. Start from the simplest thing, and then work towards all the stuff you didn’t have time for. The best distraction is self-love and care. Once you set yourself right, things will fall in place.

Nasty name shame was daily occurrence, also never a day goes by without him blowing things out of proportion. He gets really sensitive as if guilty, saying things like, “Why do you always do this? Its just a game. Im not meeting her, am i? We are not hanging out. Do i still want her? No. Do i still want to see her? No. I fucking hate her. Its just a game.

We could go on talking for hours about random stuff, he would also accompany me to explore places. Same vibe, same dynamic, was an extremely great partner in work, games, whatever we were doing. I really enjoyed his presence.

But he was also extremely dishonest, laidback, and unmotivated. He lives by this “don’t ask, don’t tell” rule. So he has this mysterious air around him all the time, really secretive as if he was guilty of something or whatnot. Which turned out to be true half the time because he was actually seeing the ex(ENFP) behind my back. Dreams big, but all talks. Does nothing to work on what he actually wants, extremely low self esteemed. On good days, he becomes super narcissistic. (The excuse was that the ENFP ex sent him into depression, causing him to be like that.) 

Has serious anger management issue(i think this is really just him tho), he would start hurling insults at me, call me a crazy psychotic stalking bitch whenever I found out that they are still in contact. He also does the whole gaslighting nonsense to try and keep you around. He blames it on depression, but after reading more on MTBI, I found out it really is just him being an unhealthy and immature ISTP.

I would think an unhealthy ISTP isn’t capable of love. They’re really just thief of happiness, sapping you dry until you become a depressed potato like them, lol. 

I wouldn’t say they are our opposites but more like the other half of the puzzle that completes us? We come together to form the same piece of puzzle in the end. A healthy ISTP can really change your life."

Does frustrates me to see these people with potential wasting their lives away, but sometimes it’s better to leave them alone before you get all caught up in their loop.

Anyway, that someone isn’t depression-depressed. He’s just sad about his circumstances, being less capable than people his age.

Getting gaslighted, blamed and hated just because I realized I had been used and stopped offering the same degree of support I used to give. And then people leave because you stopped being useful to them. That’s reality.

Friends say I have a savior complex, good lord I couldn’t agree more. I, too feel so sick and tired of trying and fighting for people who does not reciprocate the same or at least be thankful to a certain degree. Gave up my dream career so I could stay close to someone to make him smile and help him get out of depression, yet all he saw was how my existence destroyed his life. Our goodwill tend to turn into disaster the moment we stop providing the same support like we initially used to.

One thing I’ve learnt from this is we can’t save people who doesn’t want to save themselves. A drug addict dies happy overdosed. We need to stop beating ourselves up over the incompetence of others. Pour these love we give to other people onto ourselves instead. Still makes me sad thinking about what happened, still got that indignant part of me hoping he will realize how his decisions is gonna cost him the rest of his life, but honestly, their life is not our’s to lead. We are not a failure just because we fail to make people see our perspective. And if they chose to leave, we got to let them go.

Sit down and save ourselves, we need this."

My doctors have nothing to say to my family, they have no explanations either. The disease has no cause, no prevention, no cure. All they could explain was that my immune system went into overdrive and started attacking my good body cells while trying to adapt to the vaccine. My mom was extremely frustrated, and felt like everything happens for a reason so why can’t you explain. But in my case, there really isn’t except that I am not compatible for vaccinations because my immune system is capable of protecting itself. So the flu vaccine actually did more harm than good.

I am taking it well, probably because I don’t see the severity of AOSD yet. So I don’t blame the jab, or anything. But it really is good to know your body type before getting anything injected into you. Right now, I am strongly advised by my doctor to avoid vaccines of any sort (still half way through my cervical cancer vaccine :/).
