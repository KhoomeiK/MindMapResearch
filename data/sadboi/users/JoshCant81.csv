I really want to second the poster‚Äôs advice above. Save, save, save. Try not to let in lifestyle creep (which is when you make more money for the first time and get excited and spend more money).

I would emphasize all of the above for anyone anyway. But in my case I got extremely sick. Car accidents happen, bad things can just happen. We never know what tomorrow holds.

(Total anecdotal hijack ahead, warning) 

I am observing a friend of mine do very well in real estate. His family is 3 generations in to investing in the immediate area, mother is a successful realtor, father does all of the work on the properties, and they have generational air-tight knowledge, processes and connections in accounting, valuation, and very low costs (due to the parent‚Äôs professions - no realtor fees, little-no remodel expenses, accounting & banking set). 

He is extremely proud of owning his multi-families and looking to buy more. He drives an old beater (although I mentioned FIRE to him last week and he hadn‚Äôt heard of it). He works very hard, and is very smart. 

I asked if I could tag along and work alongside with his father doing remodel work (I have no family) for free, just follow along and help and learn what he is doing. He doesn‚Äôt want to as it doesn‚Äôt benefit him enough. 

I don‚Äôt resent this person. I would not be impressed if he drove a luxury car (he is young, dating, and a lot of people in my area do) and obviously he is making some good choices. 

That said the total lack of generosity of spirit in allowing me, who has no resources, learn from someone who does... he makes so much money he doesn‚Äôt even bother to learn about what his dad is doing. His dad repairs, his mom decorates, the family finds the properties... etc) 

I have my own home, which is falling apart. I cannot afford to repair things so need to do it myself. I have to DIY everything and it is/can be janky and can devalue my (very modest) home. 

I also have an illness that everyone I have heard of who has ever had it has had to go home and live with family while they recover (if they fully recover), for a few years. I have no family to go to. 

My personal experience has me constantly asking not *why me* but *what now*. And I keep trying to tackle my health and the house and finances and it is not only a disadvantage, but nearly impossible to do alone.

AmItheAsshole,eyugch8,t1_eyua6gc,1567461410.0,"NAH. 

He doesn‚Äôt have to be the kind of guy who is ok with it. 

I would offer him, politely and genuinely, if he wants to replace that income. If not, you can either a) look for another line of work, or b) stand your ground and continue doing this. In the case of b), either he will come to terms with it or there will be resentment, fighting, and you‚Äôll want to end it. If you are 100% he will decline to replace the income (can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt, it doesn‚Äôt matter to this decision as it‚Äôs your main source of income). You can get a different income stream or go straight to b) and see if he can either accept it in time or you want to break up. 

I read recently 80% of long term couple‚Äôs underlying problems go unresolved. He may learn to work with this. But no one wants to have the same fight over and over. If he ultimately can‚Äôt be ok with it, and you want to continue, the relationship will have to end. 

There are plenty of other men who would replace the income. There are plenty of others who would be fine with it (but couldn‚Äôt or wouldn‚Äôt want to replace the income). If you tie yourself to him too long, you will have opportunity costs of not meeting *those* people. 

And don‚Äôt mind the inevitable downvotes. A lot of people (men and women) resent women who can make money this way."

Obesity is the #1 killer in the US. Not sure where you are. 

These tests would be better based on BMI or some other measure of quality nutrition/exercise. Not saying smoking isn‚Äôt harmful, it‚Äôs just not the biggest health risk of all.
