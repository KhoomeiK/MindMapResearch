BPDrecovery,fagebga,t1_fa92h9l,1576050558.0,"Ugh. Well I’m glad you felt better after posting!When my mental health was worse, I was a fly on the wall at most of my jobs, just trying hard not to be noticed so no one would mind if I disappeared. I was frequently out or late for some reason and felt so terrible about it I’d eventually quit. I always cared a lot about my jobs but I know it didn’t seem that way to others. It’s very awkward showing up to work knowing you stayed up till 6am the night before trying not to kill yourself and pretending everything is fine. 

I can’t imagine how awful it would feel if people knew and were being judgmental about it. Judgment about my mental health and how I cope is one of my biggest triggers because I grew up being told I was basically exaggerating, being rude or dramatic, and not getting better fast enough. You’re brave for being honest. I’d recommend talking to your boss about other people making comments about your mental health - that’s totally inappropriate."

BPDrecovery,f7qknsb,t1_f7qetw0,1573965344.0,"You’re still in the beginning stages of treatment - it will get better I promise. Are you still in constant contact with your family? It sounds like the things they’re saying are objectively abusive, and it sounds like you’re saying your mom was also so sensitive that she would have threatened suicide when faced with criticism. Have you received any therapy for trauma? I believe this is one thing DBT severely lacks (at least mine did) - I never got to process the way I was treated growing up (and therefore never learned it was inappropriate and damaging), and I never learned to validate myself because the focus was more on changing. DBT was informative and helped shift my perspective, but it was not healing for me - I always felt like I was being told to “control” myself so I wouldn’t act crazy and ruin my life or the lives of those around me. I didn’t learn to validate myself, trust myself, believe myself, love myself. That came from trauma therapy later on (in my case EMDR with a very compassionate therapist). For example, my DBT therapist thought I was “revving myself up” to the point of suicidal impulses because that was the only way I felt like I could get people to care about me. In reality, I was having emotional flashbacks and feeling trapped, gaslit and so invalid that I felt I should die. Several sessions of EMDR did more for that than a year of DBT. I almost never get episodes like that anymore.

I’m really sorry your current therapists seem at the end of their rope. My old DBT therapist once told me I was crossing boundaries by keeping her on the phone too long (I called maybe once a week at most) and staying past the hour in therapy. I was mortified - I had no idea there was a phone call limit, and she always asked questions and kept conversations going so I had no idea I was staying too long or taking too much time. Shouldn’t a therapist wind the conversation down and say something at the end of the hour? I felt so humiliated and ashamed because it was the first time I really fully engaged in therapy by being honest about my thoughts/feelings and actually calling my therapist between sessions like you’re supposed to. She later apologized and said she had been “unskillful” by not setting boundaries but she still seemed frustrated by me a lot. It was really bad for my progress and eventually I quit. Please remember that therapists are people too, who can be imperfect, unskillful, biased and burnt out for their own dumb reasons."

If she does have ADHD, it will be so helpful for her to have a framework to understand how she’s different from others (different, not bad), and how to manage when life starts really demanding that she conform. It will also be helpful for you to know what approaches work or don’t work, so you can stop trying to move a brick wall and feeling like a failure as a parent."

It’s true that other people make mistakes like this sometimes, but I think it’s more scary for people like us because we know it can happen again no matter how badly we don’t want it to.

It took me another 8 years to be diagnosed with ADHD."
ADHD,f77i3qr,t1_f772oat,1573457768.0,"Took me 30 years but I finally have this sort of attitude as well. I grew up hearing I was too sensitive, my family rolling their eyes at me, getting annoyed or offended because I had a low tolerance to stimulation. It was often considered nasty and rude to even say anything about it (e.g. asking to turn down the music a bit) so I stopped trying and ended up learning how to dissociate instead (other stressful shit happened when I was younger that contributed to general trauma-type reactions to stress).

For years I felt so hurt, angry and ashamed that they didn’t understand me, didn’t seem to care to understand me, and were so judgmental. I think  some part of me must have thought they could be right that I was too sensitive, rude, dramatic and selfish. Because the more I learned about myself, the more I forgave and accepted myself and learned to actually sort of appreciate the things I was taught to hate about myself... the more I found I didn’t give a shit what they thought. Like genuinely, not out of resentment - it’s just genuinely not my problem if my mom thinks I’m X or my brothers think I’m Y. They have their own, separate perspective on the world and just because it’s different doesn’t mean it’s correct. When people are judgmental like that, it’s a good sign they hold themselves to the same insane standard (e.g. it’s noble and polite to suffer in silence for the sake of those around you). That causes them the same pain, isolation and shame that it caused me. So really, I do feel a bit sorry for them.

It helps to have met many other people like me in support groups who I genuinely admire and respect. When I was first learning to accept myself and I heard things that would cut me to the core, I would think “if someone said that about [insert respected friend here] would I believe them? what would my advice be to that friend?” because it sure wouldn’t be “you should ruminate on this, feel angry and helpless, and wonder if maybe it’s true” :P"

BPD,f3ta6j6,t3_dhy399,1571124622.0,"First of all your boyfriend’s anger problems sound really serious - threatening to kill someone on the phone is fucked up. There is no reasoning to excuse it - he needs help. A “normal” person would also feel uncomfortable and shocked by that behavior, so please don’t pathologize yourself too much. It seems like he lacks self awareness if he can behave that way and then act so confused about how it could possibly upset you. That is super invalidating for you and sometimes that’s enough to make someone dissociate - you’re told your intense feelings are bad and wrong, so you just stop feeling/showing them.

I’m just saying this to provide some perspective if you need it, because I know people like us can get lost believing our feelings are problematic and our reactions are wrong: if I were in a relationship with someone who did that, I would be shocked and disturbed, and either break up with them or insist they get help. Not saying you should do that because I don’t know you, I’m just trying to offer a different perspective.

I used to shut down like that often in situations that resemble what you describe. People with poor anger management triggered it. Dealing with old trauma in EMDR therapy helped a lot. I started that therapy after my boyfriend (who has bipolar) was dealing badly with irritability and impatience and I found myself completely shutting down and basically turning into a silent crying child who wanted to hurt myself to make his anger stop. After therapy it’s much easier for me to stay present and see what’s happening for what it is - someone else losing control and I’m ok, didn’t do anything wrong, and am not in danger. It also helped me place responsibility correctly, knowing that he also needed help.

Never at any point did he threaten physical harm to me or anyone, or call anyone names. Those things would understandably make anyone upset and afraid."

Of the ~15 antidepressants and anti anxiety medications I’ve tried over as many years, a month on vyvanse seemed almost curative of so many things I struggled with most of my life - existential emptiness and dread, constant restlessness, constant sense of forgetting something important, impulsivity. I’ve gained a sense of competence and confidence I never thought possible for me. 

Stimulants aren’t perfect - I do have OCD and though vyvanse seemed to erase it, concerta seems to make it a bit worse. I have to eat more consistently and a lot more protein otherwise physically I feel bad and emotionally am more likely to crash at night. I have to avoid smoking because my heart races in a very uncomfortably way (this is probably a good thing lol). 

Also if the dose goes too high I turn into a bit of a robot - I lack subtle self awareness/self reflection, get stuck on wanting to complete tasks regardless of their importance, stop feeling things and wanting to be close to others. For a while I didn’t mind because when you’re in it, it feels powerful and great to be able to get stuff done. But then my relationship started to suffer and I started missing my friends, and I’m much happier now a lower dose.

TwoXADHD,evecwsd,t3_cjirph,1564462960.0,"I felt the same way until I tried stimulants at age 29 and realized what “normal” felt like - erased any doubt that I was just faking it or not trying hard enough or imagining things or making up excuses. I think this is common with women and others who internalize symptoms or have a lot of self doubt/anxiety, and it’s why we go years without getting diagnosed and treated. I felt like a confused, restless, overwhelmed failure trying to live life like everyone else, and therapists treated it like a stubborn self esteem problem so nothing ever changed, which made it feel hopeless.

I was misdiagnosed for years and had docs actively resist trying stimulants, but they changed my life.
