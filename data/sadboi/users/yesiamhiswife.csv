Anxiety,fm0esui,t3_frslfn,1585655525.0,"Same here. Our friends are regularly doing video calls together, but we often can’t participate because we have both kids home due to the virus. So here I am worrying that they won’t like us that much anymore and won’t be so close after this ends. I should mention we text chat daily. And we’re friends for 10+ years. So yeah. It’s weird."
Anxiety,fls0xln,t1_flron5i,1585432018.0,I actually needed to read this. Thank you!
Parenting,flq20la,t1_flpdtvv,1585376095.0,"Lack of personal/couple time (especially in these days) and afraid of missing on stuff like I will have so much to learn to be updated when I can actually work (which I love to) that all the time spent working even when I was really tired will be useless. 
Hoping I got this right."
Parenting,flq1nih,t1_flp1oyl,1585375717.0,Well I keep comforting myself that the little one will grow too and it will be okay. But then “what if THIS is your life now?” hits. Or atleast for more 5 years :(
Parenting,flpzac7,t1_floxta5,1585373403.0,"Exactly! And at first we said “hey, it’s not going to be that bad, atleast we can finally spend more time together!” Now we can talk peacefully for about 30mins before one of us falls sleep.  And that’s kind of it."
Parenting,flovyu7,t1_flouxgn,1585346602.0,"Absolutely the same here. It’s like they are total opposites. The oldest one is just like a ray of sunshine. Happy and always smiling, singing. Truth be told I was smiling way more when he was near me growing up. But the baby-phase with the youngest sucked my entire energy out."
Parenting,floub5m,t3_fpxsnn,1585345625.0,You guys have no idea how much you’re helping!
Parenting,flou7qo,t1_flo5r5z,1585345570.0,"Well that’s true. On one hand, if I’m being super real with myself, we’d be either be spending money like we’d have it, either be super good financially because we’d have way more time to work."
Parenting,flotqvw,t1_flokp6j,1585345302.0,"Not 100% but, you mean like there may be some other stuff that actually make me feel this way?"
Parenting,flosyyk,t1_flod3nm,1585344847.0,"I honestly didn’t think of it like that. Well not until now. But can a person be depressed even though she/he has happy moments? Like feeling real happiness? Not everyday, but I hope you understand what I mean."
Parenting,flosie8,t1_flo8b3w,1585344581.0,"God, yes!!! I miss having more adult conversations. And whenever I do have them and the kids are around, i get constantly interrupted by one or the other. But it’s a bit weird that this wasn’t the case when I only had the oldest one. It didn’t bother me that much."
Parenting,flo8965,t1_flnpgte,1585333425.0,"I’m honestly not sure. I do know I had it almost the entire last year. It was horrible and don’t want to go through that again ever, if possible. But I started feeling so much better in the beginning of this year that I honestly thought I finally got through it. Can it like... come back?"
Parenting,flo7t2u,t1_flo0afg,1585333188.0,"You have all my respect! I can’t imagine how hard it must be and even like that, I’m sure you’re doing an awesome job with everything !"
Parenting,flo7ken,t1_flnypda,1585333059.0,"Oh, the username is from a inside joke of ours. We are friends since we were 13 or so and have been a couple for 12 years now. 
How do you get to connect? When we actually have time to sit down and connect, it’s awesome. I mean butterflies and all-awesome. But by the time he comes home from work I’m usually so tired I’m not in the mood for anything. And he gets it, but we just miss it."
Parenting,flo6wy5,t1_flny3ll,1585332716.0,"This is really nice! Thank you! I wouldn’t give them for anything in the world, you’re right!"
Parenting,flo6ipl,t1_flnvbw8,1585332508.0,"It will help. Did you consider doing some online courses? Bought myself some to help me with the “business”, but obviously didn’t have time for them. Yet (I’m a freelancer, so “business” is a bit too fancy for me right now)."
Parenting,flo629o,t1_flntifi,1585332275.0,How did you realize you regret it? I keep asking myself if I also do but I’m not even sure how to find the answer
Parenting,flo5n4h,t1_flnrdb6,1585332057.0,"Not sounding like a bitch, you’re actually right. At least for me. We often surprised ourselves that when the kids came home, we weren’t as happy as we expected we would be. And for that too I feel really bad. My mom used to tell me how she couldn’t let me at my grandmothers for more than 2 days because she missed me too much. And I remember that too. I remember her coming after me and just be ecstatic about seeing me again. I’d love to feel that too, both me and the kids."
Parenting,flo4xk0,t1_flnra8n,1585331682.0,"Yikes, totally feel you on the breakdown. 
I also have a ton of stuff I’d really love to do, learn, but can’t. And I keep thinking “what if I’ll never have time to do them because of the kids?” Or if it’s something I want to learn that is work related “what if when I actually do have time it will be too late?”"
Parenting,flo44lh,t1_flns0ls,1585331261.0,It feels so comforting to know that there are people who actually understand this and even go through this. And it really helps. Thank you!
Parenting,flo3t6z,t1_flnod8y,1585331095.0,"Now that you mention it, the reason we started having kids at that age was exactly to not have to worry about babies&toddlers in our 30s. Our eldest family member is my dad, who is 54. When they were 40 we were already on our own and they were all looking like having so much fun. Both my and my husbands parents were going on holidays together and having a blast. But they never said anything about feeling like this when they were young. So I figured it was something wrong with me, even though it’s a totally different world we live in now."
Parenting,flo3bin,t1_flnqbf0,1585330841.0,"Yup, was doing all of that and was actually starting to see super-improvements. Now I’m trying to keep working as much as possible. Hope this is going to be enough"
Parenting,flnjwgc,t1_flniyxb,1585320149.0,"You're right! Truth be told, before all of this, I was finally starting to feel like I have an actual adult life, besides being a mother. Started working from home more, going to the gym and my best friend and I were planning on having a day-a-week when we can paint just to relax. Poof! All gone. I know it's temporary. So again, I don't understand why I have these thoughts. Why am I so afraid/or why do I have the feeling that I'm missing on stuff because of them? Because it's not their fault and most of the times it's not even bad, I really love them."
puppy101,fiwnh7n,t1_fiwkzqn,1582793726.0,Will look for it today in petshops or somewhere online. Hopefully I’ll find something at least similar to this. (We don’t have that many cool pet stuff in Romania)
puppy101,fiwj0m7,t1_fittbhu,1582787909.0,"Yeah, noticed that he sometimes just pees without any kind of warning. Sometimes he looks surprised, that’s pretty cute, haha. Even if I have to clean up afterwards"
puppy101,fiwixk2,t1_fivrdke,1582787806.0,"Unfortunately keeping him in a playpen or closing him in a room isn’t really an option right now, but I usually keep an eye on him (I’m in maternity leave, so always home). Thought that sniffing in circles might be a cue! Thank you!"
puppy101,fiwiqke,t1_fitawi8,1582787575.0,"I use spray to clean, but not always bacterial. Will use it always from now on, thanks for the tip!
What kind of bottle is that?"
puppy101,fit4arz,t1_fit3loy,1582703843.0,You have no idea how much light you’ve put in my brain right now. Thank you!!
puppy101,fit3una,t1_fit3i80,1582703299.0,"Thank you!! So the only solution would be waiting, right? And just keep telling him how to do it. Should I also show him even if I didn’t catch him right in the middle if his business? Saw different posts where people say that training happens almost over-night, so I’m still learning how pups work :)"

What app is this?"
