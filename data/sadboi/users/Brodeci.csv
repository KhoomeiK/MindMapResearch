FIFA,fr2n88x,t3_gm2wku,1589840277.0,"Telling EA to implement a whole new system because you get annoyed :( at the current one is just as ridiculous as people using the INHERENTLY NEUTRAL celebration system to frustrate someone.

You want EA to change something that exists in every other one of their games when you can instead just do literally anything else. Smoke your bowl, check your phone, take all the kick off time allowed, pet your cat. ANYTHING

You are playing an opponent who I guess only needs a few seconds and a few pixels to live rent free in your head, but they are the problem. Lol. 

This sub is so weird and entitled. I have a post from literally last week screenshotted of someone saying watching replays and celebrations is no biggie and he was downvoted to hell and told “lol why does this need its own post?” Yet this garbage gets posted twice a day and immediately gets 300+ upvotes from people who took a hard loss from a sweaty player.

Gunners,fpe5h0t,t1_fpdlb34,1588540734.0,"I think they’re both right to be fair.  Part of being an excellent dribbler is knowing when to release the ball. Someone like Pepe will dribble a whole defense or pull off a skill no one saw coming while Ozil will move past you or around you with the least amount of effort possible.  He’s smooth. Part of why I Stan Ozil so hard is his footballing style feels so natural.  Like the way football is intended to be played. Similar to what they say about Brazilian footballers.  His movement with and without the ball is something like a symphony.

You are smoking rocks if you think that the 10 people you played is even remotely representative to the millions of people who play FUT. I’m not saying toxic behavior isn’t toxic but I’m saying it’s not the majority. Not even close. 
It’s funny you or OP or whoever say that EA should let you do other things while your opponent celebrates. You can already do that. It’s called closing your eye balls or doing literally anything else. If you think a 30 sec attempt done to frustrate an opponent into leaving or making mistakes is the threshold for being a horrible person, don’t watch sports or don’t exist in reality for that matter. 

Neither your opponent nor EA owe you any increase in efficiency to your FUT grind.

I love celebrations. I run an arsenal squad and if they ever added a laca auba handshake celebration I’d be so hype. 

It’s part of the game. If I skill your whole defense and chip the keeper, I’ll celebrate. If I score a later 90 minute winner in WL with my favorite player to rank me up I’ll celebrate. That’s why it’s there. It’s not always necessary but it’s not inherently toxic"

LawSchool,fnmjzi7,t3_g255i9,1587072803.0,"This was me and still is me to some extent. Couple big things that I learned that helped:

First that law school is probably making your depression worse. High pressure, highly difficult, required relentless ambition and all the other stuff law school is makes existing as a regular person a lot harder. I mean how can it not? Our worth and future is essentially measured in one grade each class each year. All that weighs on you mentally. Probably does for everyone in here. So knowing that made feel a little better. Knowing that there wasn’t something wrong with me.

Next is kinda important, and I cannot stress this enough, **make time for things in your life that don’t make you fucking MISERABLE.** it’s so easy to get wrapped up in all that’s required to be a successful law student that you often neglect things that make you a successful and healthy human being. Whatever it is that brings you joy in this life, do it more. No matter how big or small. Never forget that you are more than a law student. You’ll be more than a lawyer. First and foremost you are a person deserving of all the good things life has to offer and you should be the first person to know that and the first person to try get some of those things. 

Lastly, really really try to find people in your life who want to see you smile. Or who want to make your life easier in anyway. Be around those people more. Have someone you can just chat with about law school or specifically not about law school. Having school friends is important bc they understand your plight more than family sometimes but it’s also important to have friends outside of law school bc they can pull you out of the world that’s making your life so much more difficult you know? 

All in all, just keep trying your best to maintain. To survive. Be kind to yourself. Achieving all B’s in law school is incredibly impressive and don’t let anyone in this sub or anyone else tell you otherwise. You’ll be a highly educated SCHOLAR. You have a lot to be proud of just by being where you are and doing what you’re doing. Never ever forget that. Please reach out if you need any kind of help at all. It can be lonely sometimes I know it. 

Hang in there :/"

Gunners,fnlwm75,t1_fnlhsig,1587061009.0,"Yep. Thats what's so frustrating about being an Ozil fan.  So much of his talent was wasted the last couple years because no one is even remotely on the same page as him.  He could assist forwards like Welbeck, Walcott and Giroud just because they ran and knew Ozil would find them.  Ozil is the same player but just hasn't had that understanding with the new squad.  Sometimes he makes a pass expecting a player to run for it and they don't and it just looks like a misplaced pass but usually when you look carefully, Ozil and his trademark body language show the disappointment when seeing no one went for it."
