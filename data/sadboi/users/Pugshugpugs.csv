childfree,fqtxa7n,t3_gkqs76,1589647892.0,"Omg. I agree!!!! I dated a piece of shit man child who was non-working and living in his mom's basement and he was 25!!!! So disgusting! That was one of my worst relationships ever. He was still in love with the mother of his child too and tried to lie about that obvious fact until he finally came clean after he got tired of using me for sex and broke up with me to go back to her lol! I would never advise anyone to date a man with a child because they always will have a thing for their baby mama. Also all of his money and time goes to the child, not to you (understandably so)."
Fibromyalgia,fqsy9te,t3_gkn69l,1589623330.0,I had to quit my FT job as a medical coder due to fibro too. I feel your pain for sure.
Fibromyalgia,fqsy40d,t3_gknixd,1589623158.0,Just speaking from personal experience here. I used to work 40 hours a week in an office as a medical coder. Very high-pressure but sedentary and repetitive-motion work. It got to a point where my boss started me on a path to being fired because I was so impaired from my symptoms and having to take too many days off. Every day I would sit there trembling and sweating from the pain of sitting in that office chair staring at the computer screen for 8 hours..it doesn't sound painful but OMG it was. I think part-time hours would have been more manageable. Best wishes to you

This is a huge reason why my husband and I decided to remain childfree. It helps that I'm infertile but still... lol

vegetarian,fnkin06,t1_fnketw6,1587028479.0,"Thank you!!!! It was something I decided on my own volition after finding out that meat comes from tortured animals who are brutally killed just so people can eat them.

Just remember everyone goes through this (including me)! I'm going on 30 years of being severely depressed. In my humble opinion, feeling depressed is a natural reaction to how much life sucks in general. Like seriously. We spend most of our lives in school and then working only to die eventually, after watching everyone else we love pass. Life is total crap! I don't blame anyone who feels depressed"

I was in a really abusive relationship that I was too stupid to get out of through 3 years of it which really put a damper on it too. I had the shittiest social experience there. But then again, I was there to get good grades (which I did) and not to socialize. I feel you 100%. I'm sure you graduated with a high GPA too from your lack of socializing lol. There is an upside. Plus none of it matters now that you are about to graduate. That degree will just be a really nice addition to your resume."

I'm married and have been on my own for years). When I worked at my last FT corporate job, I was making a shitload of money, but was completely depressed and wanting to die all the time because I was always at work! What's the point of making money if I'm never going to see the house I work to pay for or be able to utilize any of it! I now work PT from home which is better for my mental health but we barely get by month to month. It's a trade-off."
BodyAcceptance,fb9xm5u,t1_fb9wtd4,1576654115.0,"I don't agree with you. Most of the research I did as an undergrad showed that therapy in general is really not effective at all. Especially for things like depression. There is nothing magic about how I got to a point of self-acceptance.  It took decades of work on my part.  Therapy was actually detrimental to all aspects of my mental health when I made the mistake of believing that these people could help me in the past ( I was wrong). It comes from within. If someone out there is reading this and therapy is helping you, more power to you. I just don't think it's all it's cracked up to be."
BodyAcceptance,fb9wq33,t1_fb9wmpv,1576652972.0,I understand that but I don't think that in particular is worth what they charge for it. That's just me though. You can help yourself without paying a stranger to pretend to listen to you talk
BodyAcceptance,fb9w0sd,t1_fb9vgu9,1576652120.0,I don't believe in therapy personally. This is coming from someone who has a bachelor's in psychology too lol. Most therapists are predatory and there is little to nothing they can do to actually help people. Any improvement seen through therapy is truly the patient helping their own selves!

BodyAcceptance,fb8ibbt,t1_fb8galy,1576614566.0,OMG... How messed up of your aunt! How did she think that was a good idea? I was like that too as a small child with the 100 cals a day thing! I started journaling all my calories and it started at 1200 a day or less until I got down to 300 per day but still burning those cals from working out. I may have lost a small amount of weight in the short-term but very quickly gained 100 pounds as a result of my body fighting back from that restriction. I've had such huge fluctuations my entire life because of that early dieting. Also didn't grow a lot in height.
BodyAcceptance,fb7ed12,t1_fb7e0bt,1576587191.0,"Yes I think they see it as a responsibility because if they didn't impose restrictions on the kids they would just eat sugar all day right?! Wrong! Kids need to be raised to trust their appetites and cravings. Providing guidance over eating intuitively and not chastising over food or using food as a reward can be helpful, but restriction always backfires. Have you read ""The F*ck it Diet"" by Caroline Dooner? (BTW mods: it's not a diet. The book is about stopping dieting and accepting your natural size)"

I don't see the point in doing anything. All I think about is my grief and how much life sucks. I don't even take care of myself anymore like I won't even brush my hair. #embarrassing #truth

I have walked around at work crying on days like that, not really caring who sees. But most of the time I pretend to be normal. Most people can see through my fake shit and can tell something is wrong regardless."
depression,f9dp7zt,t1_f9dnpce,1575235580.0,Oh and the other thing is maybe online degrees would be easier on your mental health (I don't know for sure if your stress has anything to do with being in the classroom or not). Maybe you could switch to that for next semester

In college most people are thin or athletic and they tend to be shallow. I was treated like shit all through university because of my weight (I am naturally fat. Always have been). Being married to someone who does not expect women to be thin has helped me greatly (not that body image should depend on your partner whatsoever, just that it helped me as someone who has been through loads of emotional abuse centered around my weight).

I have fibro and a few other autoimmune conditions. I went and got certified as a medical coder because it can be done from home and it's not physical at all. Those long hours sitting at a desk are hard on your body too, but running around doing heavy lifting would be worse. Make sure you try to seek out jobs that are within the realm of what you ""can"" do physically, even if that means taking some extra classes or studying for a certification exam. 

I worked a corporate job for an insurance company for a year and it killed me honestly. They wouldn't work with me with FMLA so I quit. Yes the fibro fog, pain, and fatigue were the main reasons."

I was with a 500 lb guy who convinced me that I was bigger than him (I wasnt even 200 at the time) so I would think that I was worthless and wouldnt leave him for a better guy. Men are disgusting creatures."
BodyAcceptance,f7jzzqp,t1_f7jhgtx,1573790886.0,That is definitely not okay!

ptsd,f3w8kye,t1_f3vqgyr,1571194653.0,Omg... thank you so much man! That is one of the only things anyone has said that actually made me feel better. I feel you 100% especially what you said about getting right with God. I do believe in the God of Christianity myself. I have to trust that he has a plan. You are right that Jesus went through his fair share of abuse. I hope you are fine now too and I pray that your trauma gets easier for you to deal with. I definitely am sorry that you went through something similar in your childhood too. :(
ChickFilA,f3uyga4,t3_dib5l1,1571169116.0,Yes it be like that a lot when I worked there in 2008. Truckloads full of kids
CPTSD,f3ux1k9,t3_d5hymy,1571168575.0,Yes used to cut myself for this reason
CPTSD,f3uwkf5,t3_db174u,1571168388.0,For me it just makes my flashbacks stronger which usually brings me to tears. I feel so helpless when I force myself to work out. My emotional pain just weighs me down
