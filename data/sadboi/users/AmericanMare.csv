I'm pretty open and post about having cerebral palsy once and awhile and I tell her of frequent challenges I have. She's super amazing about them and doesn't much care. She thinks I'm great and I think she's great. I think it's important to be open and honest. If I post a picture of me standing any kind of way you're gonna know some things wrong. Honestly tho if you decide to put your diagnosis or pictures of you where you don't ""pass as normal"" and people don't want to talk to you simply because of that. They don't deserve your time and effort. Look for someone who sees you for you. As a whole person and not just a diagnosis."
AskAsexual,fqv2smk,t1_fqv1sjk,1589668730.0,Honestly I was thinking that myself.
PMDD,fqcjlp7,t3_ghke5n,1589259921.0,I almost stabbed my mother with scissors once it was so intense. This is why I give literally no fucks what my family thinks about medication or therapy. (Not my mom or dad their pretty supportive).

asexuality,fprvvt5,t3_gf1jrz,1588863040.0,In high school I started to figure out I was bi. But hella confused. I didn't see boys or girls in the same way other people did. Sex scared me and I was like wtf-. It was confusing because attraction obviously is usually based on sex for most people. So finding that I was bi-ROMANTIC was a hell of a thing 😂

unOrdinary,fog6kft,t1_fog6dlk,1587748569.0,That's true. Like if the romance stuff doesn't destroy or overpower the plot then I'm solid 😂
unOrdinary,fog60vb,t1_fog5s32,1587748350.0,Exactly. I just want to hold onto the one thing I have 😂 I do enjoy Subzero for example. But I hone (I can't spell) a lot more on the dragons and suck rather than the 2 main characters sexual tension.
unOrdinary,fog2q42,t1_fog20na,1587747056.0,I mean I could see it I guess but I don't want the webtoon to turn onto something it's not

CerebralPalsy,fofnsgw,t1_fofn7sv,1587739606.0,Exactly. That's how I feel too. I'm probably just gonna try to do PT when I'm older.
CerebralPalsy,fofmgjm,t3_g798my,1587738888.0,Wow you and I are pretty similar (except I'm 18) 😂 I know someone else with CP (although his was a lot more severe). And I'm like dude- how?? (He went through a lot of surgeries) I'd be so scared!!!
vaginismus,fofm5os,t3_g75upr,1587738726.0,I mean....I have a girlfriend- I can't do any of that stuff (don't want to) either 😂

asexuality,fnwt1bb,t3_g47v1p,1587324875.0,"Ummm has he SEEN r/arethestraightsok. With that subreddit I could make a DAMN good argument that heterosexuality is a mental illness, but I don't cuz I'm a nice person 😂"
bisexual,fnrf3o1,t3_g3cam1,1587187056.0,Glad I know about this!! I'm in behavioral health science and mmmmighhtttt do psychiatry so that's lots of chem
depression,fnped6x,t3_g33rqu,1587144031.0,"I see your point and it's important for us to work on ourselves, I've basically gotten to the point of knowing I don't need anyone else's validation or to lean on others for self worth. However I'm still generally depressed. But I think your missing that many individuals (including myself) mask depression very well to the outside world. I can replicate happiness, joy and excitement. And we can have happy moments. Just like someone else said tho, while it's our job to fix ourselves it doesn't mean we are undeserving of friends who CAN handle our bad days. We're people too"
INTP,fno9icv,t3_g2ve49,1587117212.0,"This is true, a lot of times I question being INTP because I have a lot of F qualities as well as extroverted (in a social sense that I am not afraid to engage in conversation and debate/argue my opinion). And I take too seriously ""no wtf that makes no sense I'm an INTP if I do all this stuff then I must not be an INTP"" but then I remember life is life and E and F traits are good to have.

SapphoAndHerFriend,fnit44i,t1_fnirwa9,1586985897.0,I knew about the propaganda and Robert and his wife's death but for me (an asexual biromantic) love doesn't obviously mean lust 😂 although I haven't heard about Louis XIII! Very interesting!! I'm gonna look that up now 😂
bisexual,fniqkrm,t3_g1ulmb,1586984611.0,Big happy 😂
SapphoAndHerFriend,fniewrh,t3_g1ui3y,1586978828.0,Um? Many romans were bisexual and many speculate that Queen Elizabeth I was asexual. We don't know for sure but yes. Monarchs can remain virgins! 😲

CerebralPalsy,fnhhsa3,t1_fngk91q,1586962652.0,"Being in a wheelchair has nothing to do with the severity FYI. If that's true then shit I'm a ""severe case"" which I'm not. I can still walk but just get tired easily. I'm going to assume since he can swim he has some use of his legs. One thing I would look into tho is wheelchair etiquette. Don't lean on his chair, don't just grab his chair and take him whereever (if it's not motorized obviously). You don't have to crotch down to talk to him ""looking down"" isn't considered rude unless you're super tall it might be more comfortable for him if you sit down (because I've talked to some really tall people for a long time and then my neck really hurts from straining). Just remember his wheelchair isn't a toy, and if he's sitting out of it don't move it (that's very annoying). I know you probably wouldn't but some people are weird like that."
GayChristians,fneshq9,t3_g1bp9m,1586895059.0,Yay!!! Good for you!
PMDD,fne7w5w,t3_g19k48,1586884612.0,It sounds like she has no meds or her meds aren't working. She should definitely contact a psychiatrist. Psychology today works well. Or possibly an OBGYN for me birth control was very helpful. I could also give you some coping skills if you like
truscum,fne3ln4,t3_g15fnq,1586882455.0,No one in America needs to use that term anymore wtf.
hetalia,fncnmzc,t3_g0w82o,1586841527.0,Fix it? Fucking nuke that shit there's no fixing that.
truscum,fncjlb8,t3_g0xhzh,1586838407.0,I was actually going to make a comment about this in a book I was reading. A MTF was repeatedly being called he/him and I was like wow that's rude. But at the end they stated he would rather be refered to by male pronouns until he believes he passes enough as to where people would naturally assume she/her pronouns. In this case I understand. And I think maybe if that's explained it's better. But if the person tells you specifically not to call them their birth sex then you're being rude.
aaaaaaacccccccce,fnb9y4b,t1_fnb97uo,1586811799.0,So they're trying to say asexuals aren't LGBT? 😂 and accidently just excluded the entire damn population of human beings 😂 I can't omfg.
aaaaaaacccccccce,fnb5v0a,t3_g0ocsu,1586809748.0,Do they mean heteros but used the wrong term?? What happened here??

truscum,fn89ggf,t1_fn81gs8,1586736732.0,Not OP but thank you. I have a friend like this who constantly complains about how horrible dysphoria is but says anyone can be trans and I'm like. Wtf.
PMDD,fn892zd,t3_g04x1w,1586736505.0,My insta followers are probably horrified at how much I talk to her 😂 DON'T PERSONIFY IT. DON'T NAME IT. THEN YOU'LL GET ATTACHED. ToO lAtE

women,fn7s4g3,t3_g03y0h,1586726518.0,I have PMDD and can confirm 😂 but that's the least of my problems
PMDD,fn7rx66,t3_g01tyk,1586726405.0,I'm asexual and I'm abit confused. Can you explain more? Do you mean you don't feel sexual attraction to your partner during your hell week(s)? Because I question whether I AM ace on my cycle 😂 libido is ABSOLUTELY out of control.
HistoryMemes,fn7b3bp,t3_fzy4vo,1586716824.0,I absolutely suck at drawing buildings but I'm not going to blame a random group of people and commit genocide because of it-
rant,fn63rrc,t3_fzqih8,1586686275.0,"Even as an asexual I find this to be true. While I don't find anyone sexually attractive, if they aren't aesthetically pleasing to the eye it's gonna be difficult for me to want to pursue a relationship with them."

truscum,fmk2etm,t1_fmk1uu2,1586142915.0,I knew about the male/female brain thing. But maybe I'm stupid I thought the problem usually came from the uterus or a predisposition. Perhaps I'm wrong.
truscum,fmjmoby,t3_fvis3t,1586133415.0,As someone with PMDD this pisses me off. As much as I love my MTF friends they won't understand until we get some really good surgery
vaginismus,fmh69jb,t3_fv6vlw,1586068132.0,Don't watch porn but I can see this being an issue. Also how about disabled people and not just for a kink or fantasy? 👀
truscum,fm9hya7,t1_fm9hlg1,1585869107.0,I don't know. I wish I knew
truscum,fm93j7x,t1_fm8zpyz,1585861037.0,"Yea, ready to glare did a good video on it. There is a disorder called BIID which is basically ""trans-abled"". But rather instead of promoting pouring bleach in your damn eyes that you go to counseling"
truscum,fm8zoac,t1_fm8ybu1,1585858975.0,Nope. There have been multiple people to have mutilated themselves to live as disabled.
truscum,fm8v59n,t3_ftqams,1585856607.0,This is just like people claiming to be trans-abled. Like what the actual fuck is wrong with people
CerebralPalsy,fm61vur,t1_fm61nce,1585784539.0,Yea that runs in my family too. So I think it was kinda both. But also Yea disabled kids are just naturally gonna have it harder in school
CerebralPalsy,fm5zx95,t1_fm5zow8,1585783387.0,"Naturally or from your environment? I know a big cause for me was severe bullying in elementary and middle school. My parents described me as happy before that. But I guess it also depends on the person. I know people who hate having CP and struggle to accept themselves. And I'm just kinda ""This is me. I wobble. If you can't handle that then fuck off"" 😂"
CerebralPalsy,fm5zjw4,t1_fm5ysm8,1585783167.0,True true. I really hope a youngster wouldn't have depression but boy I would understand if they did.
CerebralPalsy,fm5wj3j,t3_ft85mk,1585781403.0,"Another thing I wanna add off the other person that commented, of course the severity of CP is important and such but also if they're young you may be asked to look for signs of epilepsy such as seizures. It's not uncommon for epilepsy and autism to be comorbid with CP so you might want to ask about that as well."
truscum,flzuwz3,t1_flzupr3,1585634346.0,Oh. OK. Nope. 😂 Thanks for the clarification
truscum,flzu6vc,t1_flztdvi,1585633695.0,Just to clarify a few things can you explain more by what you mean with social support? Just so I can get a better handle on things.
truscum,flz8z8e,t1_flz8yaw,1585618182.0,Thank you
truscum,flz8mgr,t1_flz8gnb,1585617953.0,Yea alright I see your point. That one's pretty minimal anyway. I'm talking about hair on your head 😂
truscum,flz88hz,t1_flz85bz,1585617704.0,Really? Oh thought it was since my MTF friend said that's one thing she was really dysphoric about.
truscum,flz7yj3,t1_flz7xoq,1585617527.0,Really?
CerebralPalsy,fludb9d,t1_flthz87,1585500329.0,Oh shit. 😂 I mean maybe if you were female I could understand (I've heard horror stories of pregnancy and birth with CP) but still. Nothing is impossible 😂 I've heard of men paralyzed from the waist down still doing it sooo
CerebralPalsy,flm1g2q,t1_fllzngm,1585272373.0,Yea that would probably help.
CerebralPalsy,fllzwwt,t1_fllyphc,1585271373.0,Oh Yea I'm not saying not to push for anti dehumanization. I totally understand that for me personally it's just gone from one extreme to the other (again personal experience). Lots of ace people have sex and orgasms. That's just not my jam 😂 believe me I've tried and either my body hates me or just nothing does it for me.
rant,flilv4a,t1_fliloyt,1585185322.0,No but also my sister has a history of bitching and not doing anything to help herself even when we offer advice or assistance. I helped raise my neice for 3 years so that's why I say she's not that difficult.

rant,flhfsj6,t1_flhfdpp,1585161822.0,Yea we're gonna go to the doctor for steroids and an inhaler possibly. I'm also thinking about asking my parents to buy me a mask
