SuicideWatch,fo9jjq0,t3_g6h76u,1587621363.0,"As a child I was abused severely by the one who was supposed to protect me most. I've lived with the memories and emotions of that childhood. Every waking day has been an insult and the only way I believe it will end is if I kill myself. I have the means, only the time remains. How about yourself?"
Eve,fo18x51,t3_g54abc,1587428167.0,I'm also having a mixed result when logging in my accounts. Most of them have timed out. Been going on for about 2 hours now.
SuicideWatch,fnbad89,t3_g0rlfz,1586812019.0,"They can and likely will call if you are a threat to yourself or someone else. Aka, you are saying you are going to kill yourself. If you say you won't, they likely won't call the police or anything. As for notifying your parents, no. I hope you do call, it can be good for you to just have someone to talk to. Just make sure not to make any threats or say you might do it and you are all good.

If you'd like to talk to someone, I can try to be here for you. Hope you have a wonderful day and I hope you start to feel better."
Eve,fn57ila,t3_fzca13,1586657802.0,I've come back after 6 years. :)
SuicideWatch,fmrefad,t1_fmrecij,1586320832.0,It's okay. Lol. I don't mind. I like talking to people. :)
SuicideWatch,fmrdw3f,t1_fmrczi6,1586320414.0,I'm just saying what my therapist said. She claims it works. Idk. I don't pretend to know. Lol.
SuicideWatch,fmr9nk6,t1_fmr8y4b,1586317218.0,"Yeah. Depression can kick you in the butt. Just 5 months ago I was losing weight, I was going to the gym, and over all feeling better. Now, I'm eating my feelings and I don't leave my house. It's not the virus that has done it. I have bipolar so I have waves. I haven't had mania in a while though. I guess meds are taking care of a little of it. Lol.

What has got you down now?"
SuicideWatch,fmr8d7x,t1_fmr81xc,1586316314.0,"Each of us is different. I can try to understand but I'll never be able to know your pain as we are all different. I'm so sorry you are struggling. If you find yourself wanting to talk, please don't hesitate. Even if it's just to rant at me and vent, I'll be your sounding board. :)"
SuicideWatch,fmr7s2t,t1_fmr7b1s,1586315894.0,"I don't know how old you are but I think you should confide in them. I did myself confide in my mother and she has been super supportive. She said that no matter what I choose, she'll be okay while I'm working on myself. That's the thing, you have to think about your health first."
SuicideWatch,fmr7ism,t3_fwyoja,1586315718.0,"Hey there, would you like to talk?"
SuicideWatch,fmr6um6,t1_fmr6kj7,1586315257.0,"I've heard the horror stories myself. It is up to you ultimately of course. But please go, I really think you will benefit from it. Being on the right combination of meds might do wonders and they can do it there with more accuracy than a regular prescriber."

SuicideWatch,fmr5n9n,t3_fwydk7,1586314446.0,"I can't tell you what a ward is like. I have never been. However, I've talked extensively with my therapist about me going and it seems like it would be worth a visit. They manage medications daily and can change meds right away. I would recommend it for you. Please be safe. If you would like to talk, I will be here. :)"
SuicideWatch,fmr4wxv,t1_fmr4ibg,1586313959.0,"Hey, it's up to you. I'm just here for you. If you find yourself in need of someone, please don't hesitate to respond or message or what ever is comfortable with you."

EliteDangerous,fmr1dji,t3_fwq2cd,1586311635.0,"Hahahaha. No. Just, no. I play Elite to disconnect, not work. They decided to make it so prohibitive that it might as well not even release. Only a few commanders will actually be able to afford it."
SuicideWatch,fmqysg3,t3_fwx97g,1586310005.0,Hey. Wanna chat with me?
SuicideWatch,fmjhky2,t1_fmjf0iq,1586130464.0,In time? Idk. I can see it. I'm so close I can reach out and touch it.
SuicideWatch,fmj99w3,t1_fmj97fr,1586125642.0,Soon hopefully. :(
SuicideWatch,fmj7sfb,t1_fmj6x4d,1586124767.0,It's okay. I've made peace with the fact that I will die by my own hand. It's just finding the right time I think that's disrupting me. Thanks
SuicideWatch,fmg1hlg,t3_fv2evs,1586039301.0,"There are some women, like myself, who don't go for extroverts. I'm sorry that you've had trouble with women in the past. If you keep looking though you will find us, we are out there. Good luck, truly. Also, if you need to talk I'm here to chat with you. Have a wonderful day."
SuicideWatch,fmg0vrc,t1_fmfzhob,1586038937.0,No problem at all. I get to talk to someone and hopefully help them out while at the same time having company for myself. Hope you have a wonderful day.

SuicideWatch,fm72zz3,t3_ftggln,1585811390.0,"My friend blamed me for wanting to die. Said I was a coward and selfish. Some how, him calling me that was not bad but me not wanting to live was. It's not right."
SuicideWatch,fm6psss,t1_fm6pe1n,1585799919.0,"I've never once told someone, ""It get's better"" or ""I understand"" or ""Everything will be okay."" Why? Because I don't believe things get better. And I know better than to believe I can understand anyone's pain. I don't know what they are going through, only what I've been through. And that's that. I come here because I'm myself depressed and suicidal. I come here to talk to people who are like me in some ways and I keep them company while they keep me company. If you don't want my company, so be it, I won't force anything on you."
SuicideWatch,fm6p8in,t1_fm6p402,1585799502.0,You don't even know if I am or not. You haven't given me a chance. You dismissed me without talking to me.
SuicideWatch,fm6ol0a,t1_fm6oejg,1585799023.0,You too?
SuicideWatch,fm6od4k,t1_fm6nu5n,1585798864.0,"I believe they mean well and only wish to help. I'm sorry that you are going through such a rough point in your life. I don't have any real specific advice to be honest, but I can listen to you and keep you company."
depression,fm6bxej,t3_ftd0cz,1585790682.0,Rant away! Lol. Would you like someone to continue ranting to or maybe just a friend? I'll be here for ya.
SuicideWatch,fm68awh,t1_fm687nm,1585788423.0,Sorry that I couldn't help. But I would really love to chat. I think it would be good for both of us to have someone to talk to.
SuicideWatch,fm684o3,t3_ftcc7k,1585788316.0,It's against the rules to promote or otherwise talk about how to do it. I won't break those rules. I can however offer you a friendly ear. Wanna chat?
SuicideWatch,fm680xy,t3_ftccfz,1585788253.0,"Hey. I'm sorry about the noise. It never stops sadly. I can't do anything about it but I can offer you someone to chat with, if you want?"
SuicideWatch,fm28t4c,t3_fsmc3h,1585692711.0,"Hey there, do you need someone to talk to?"
SuicideWatch,flz455a,t1_flz3w79,1585615106.0,"I never reported it out of fear. By the time I told the truth, it was far too late to do anything. Statue of limitations being what it is.

I've never considered doing that and to be honest I won't. I'm too much of a coward to actually confront him on it."
SuicideWatch,flz30p8,t1_flz2cmd,1585614427.0,"Yeah, life, well you understand why I want to end my life then. It would just be for the best."
SuicideWatch,flz01kw,t1_flyyqja,1585612621.0,"Well I might as well explain. At age 5 my father began to rape me, repeatedly, until age 11. My suicidal thoughts began then. It's one of the few things that can trigger me, talk about him. Sorry. :(

Um. Well it wasn't DID exactly but I dissociate when I get uncomfortable or stressed out. It's like I am behind the wheel but I have no control where it's going, that's my body. As it goes for Bipolar, I know I have it. I have the lows and the manic highs. It's only under control thanks to medication. Though they are trying to get me on a new med, something to also get rid of the voice in my head that tells me to die. It's like a troll who just keeps sending me the same messages, to just do it already. So yeah. 

And that's capitalism at it's worst. We are seeing it right now with the virus. Those who are elite, rich, or otherwise from power they can get tested and treated without delay. But the random Jane, aka me, couldn't get a test even if I showed symptoms."
SuicideWatch,flyw0me,t1_flyvnu3,1585610242.0,"Oh no. I've been suicidal since I was 5. I've been diagnosed with Complex PTSD, Bipolar 1, Depression, and my doctor recently mentioned DID. Though that last one hasn't been confirmed and yeah."
SuicideWatch,flyv2q6,t1_flyuhxf,1585609693.0,"I don't know when it started. I have been told I was kinda bad as a kid but it got progressively worse as a young adult. I'm not sure what triggered it.

Yeah. My hands are raw from the washing it. Like, I saw a video on how to properly wash your hands after the virus and now I do it until it hurts. I know it's not logical, once I'm in the house I don't need to wash as much but I can't help but to do it. If I don't, my mind concentrates on my hands and they start to feel like they are on fire. Even sitting here talking about it is making me want to wash up. Lol. I'm probably gonna do it. But I still don't mind talking about it. Ha. Anyway. Um, no meds for it. I'm on enough meds as it is.

It's not easy but there are people with far worse problems than me. I just know it bothers me a lot. Idk. It's hard to explain. Lol."
SuicideWatch,flytz0u,t1_flyt5x2,1585609058.0,"Both of my grandmothers were awesome. Never met my grandfathers. Wish I never met my father. It would likely have prevented many of my conditions that I have now.

No, it's not fucked up thinking. Only thing I've said I'm going to do is dance on my father's grave... if I'm still alive when he dies.

I do treasure my mom with all my heart.

Yeah, it's kinda one of those things where if someone else touches something of mine, it needs to be disinfected. It is torture but I've been tortured since being a child so yeah. I don't mind talking about it, I'm not triggered by it for the most part.

Lockdown is not a departure from my normal every day life but knowing I can't go see my therapist or get a coffee is bothering me. Also I'm scared about going out and bringing anything home with me and giving it to my mom."
SuicideWatch,flyho2l,t1_flyfwni,1585602336.0,I guess I'd rather the non-help than being contacted by trolls who tell me just to go through with it. Oh well.
SuicideWatch,flxl46i,t1_flx7dio,1585585008.0,Maybe. I've tried that before but was left alone anyway. My post went without a single person posting. So I don't know anymore.
SuicideWatch,flxkvcn,t1_flwnkoc,1585584873.0,"Thank you for your kind words. My mom, I just love her deeply and don't want to see anything happen to her.

I've been a germaphobe for the last 10+ years. As a kid and even young adult I was fine. But it's come on quite bad lately. I haven't been able to use a pubic restroom in years. I can't touch meat. I wash my hands even when there is no reason. Well now I wash my hands even more. Lol."
SuicideWatch,flwdpo6,t1_flwd5v2,1585547136.0,"My mom is so stubborn. But I took her stubbornness and apply it in my life. Lol. My father, was a truly evil man. I hope my mom doesn't take a major illness to turn to me more. She's so independent and I'm afraid she's going to lose that independence and it's literally going to kill her. As for getting around. Either she drives or I take public transport. Though with Covid-19 going around and my germaphobia, I haven't gotten onto a bus in months."
SuicideWatch,flwc6ye,t1_flwbo77,1585545749.0,"I've already been doing that. Snapping pictures from time to time of her. She hates it. Saying she looks ugly and she doesn't like the way she looks. But I do it anyway. She's very independent. I can't drive, physically and mentally. It's a phobia, one of many, that prevents me from doing a normal thing everyone else does. I can't drive, it just literally freaks me out and causes an anxiety attack. So since she drives and is the only one who can, she stays rather mobile. It's hard for her to do but she does it."
SuicideWatch,flw9yme,t1_flw7kcb,1585543790.0,"Everyone has commented about her memory loss. She even commented on her memory loss. She's upset about it and I see it. She goes in to her appointments on her own. I'm unaware if she's had them do any testing. I don't pry in on her business. She was under treatment but they stopped paying for it. So she has ""recovered"" on her own. It was not easy. I haven't talked to her to do it but it is something I can discuss with her. Her stroke left her left side all but useless. She can walk but she has a limp. Her left arm (dominate arm) is useless. She can't write correctly and she has no strength. She is not bed bound though, thankfully, I've been able to work with her to get her out of bed."
SuicideWatch,flw797v,t1_flw76dd,1585541560.0,"Okay, I hope you have a wonderful night."
SuicideWatch,flw67y0,t1_flw509e,1585540744.0,"I'm sorry they have done that. It's not easy going to a friend/loved one when you have these feelings and to have them do that is wrong, you deserve better.

Can you tell me, what's got you needing to go to them in the first place?"
SuicideWatch,flw5jw7,t3_frjb2r,1585540230.0,"You've lived a rough life. I wish there was a way to just make things better, it's simply beyond my ability. I can offer you though someone to just talk to, or maybe rant at, or or you can yell at the top of your lungs at me. I will take it all for you. Just, talk to me for a while."
SuicideWatch,flw4u6o,t3_frjake,1585539686.0,Hey. I'm willing to talk to you regardless of your state of mind. Who are you talking about by the way?
SuicideWatch,flw4oam,t3_friqif,1585539564.0,Hey there. Would you like to talk?
SuicideWatch,flw3bar,t1_flw008u,1585538556.0,"Maybe it's something else, I'm not sure. All I know is she's losing her memory and is getting easily startled at everything. Forgetting my name. She's under a lot of stress but she is getting worse."
SuicideWatch,flvxel7,t1_flvwy4o,1585534388.0,I'm just not gonna call. They ruined that for me. So next time I'm gonna just handle it by my self.
SuicideWatch,flvt2jq,t1_flvsb8d,1585531451.0,"You're just not suicidal enough for them apparently. I'm sorry you had that rough experience. I wish it was call in when you are trying your hardest not to kill yourself and need a little extra support to get through your hard time. Then someone just listens to you. Oh and don't show impatience with the caller. What the hell right!? You are a suicide hotline, act like one. But yeah."
SuicideWatch,flvs3h3,t1_flvrwi3,1585530799.0,"Yeah. They don't care about you, it's always about them when it comes to the police. You might be a danger so let's treat you like one. They just make it worse."
SuicideWatch,flvruz7,t1_flvr76z,1585530636.0,"That's messed up. I know they have a series of questions to see if you are suicidal that moment and then they will evaluate you. It's like, ""Are you suicidal?"" ""Do you have any plans?"" ""Do you have means to do it?"" ""Do you have a set time?"" And lastly ""Have you taken any actions to end your life tonight?"" If you hit no on any of them, then they kinda just brush you off it seems. I guess that's better than answering yes to all of them and having them threaten emergency services. Lol."
SuicideWatch,flvrex0,t1_flvqt4h,1585530337.0,"It's okay. I lied, again, to get out of it. I hate lying but I had to get out of that. Told them I was perfectly fine. All I did was just bottle it inside like I do with everything now."
SuicideWatch,flvqsbw,t1_flvpglg,1585529923.0,I think my mom has early signs of dementia. She forgets thing easily. :( I'm afraid she'll forget me one day.
SuicideWatch,flvkzna,t1_flvk6h4,1585526115.0,"It took a bit to show up. That is weird. I got the notification on my phone but it didn't show on the PC. Oh well.

My relationship with my mom is very close and open. Like I don't tell her details but I did tell her the truth because that's what she wanted. She worries about me no matter what. But she's fine with the knowledge about my suicidality. She just doesn't want me doing it before she dies. She of course doesn't want me doing it anyway but we talked about it and I told her that if I do it, I'm deeply sorry and that my suffering ended. That's the best I can offer for her. I love her with all my heart and she is literally the only reason I'm alive."
SuicideWatch,flvi7dl,t1_flvgmjc,1585524356.0,"It said you replied, not sure if you did now, it's not showing up for me."
SuicideWatch,flvhcde,t1_flvgmjc,1585523823.0,"My mom had a stroke. I moved back home, over 1,000 miles away, to take care of her. It damaged my relationship with my partner. She wanted someone local and that was that.

My therapist, she's an odd one. I've told her that I'm suicidal but as long as I tell her that I'm safe with myself and she believes it, she won't call or attempt to take me in. I did have a really bad day a couple weeks back where I was in her office and she knew I was gonna do it. We talked for the entire hour session and at the end, I was slightly better and safer. But I also had to lie again. I have to lie to keep people from sending me away. I hate lying. It bothers me to do. But I'm still around so I guess something worked. Idk.

I'm so sorry to hear she passed away. I've kinda made a promise to my mom that I will do everything in my power to stay around until she's gone but as soon as she's gone, I'm done. I told her that flat out. But I also told her, I may do it before that time and if I do I'm sorry."
SuicideWatch,flvfz5x,t1_flvf95a,1585522993.0,"Exactly. I will never text or call again. I'm not taking a risk of being treated like a criminal again. I didn't do anything wrong and they want to send police to my door. Worse yet, I take care of m elderly mother. So if they showed up, she would freak out and cry. Yesterday my uncle died and it's torn her up inside. I am, taking it hard but I bottle things up well. Ticking time bomb but that's something for future me to deal with. But I digress, if they showed up and took me away now she would be left alone. Then what!? No, I'll never trust the hotlines again. I don't even know if I should trust my therapist anymore."

SuicideWatch,flumuy6,t1_flulyfy,1585505805.0,"I was in therapy every week. I felt like we were getting somewhere. Then the virus struck, which btw is literally a nightmare of mine because I'm a germaphobe, but when it did, everything went to online. I am not getting the same level of help out of a phone call. Idk. Anyway. I just wish there wasn't handcuffs. And to add to what the other person said in this post, they had a $3,000 bill at the end of it. I am lucky to have insurance but I don't want other people to have to pay for my stay in a hospital that isn't going to help me anyway. So yeah. And I have to take care of my mom which means I can't leave her and to add to that with the virus running around, it's going to sweep through hospitals and it's going to kill people. Idk. I'm kinda scared of getting it because I don't want to pass it to my mom and also I'm actually scared of dying by a virus. Part of my germaphobia I guess. Lol. But yeah, it's okay."
SuicideWatch,flul5mc,t1_flukma9,1585504815.0,"I live in the US yes. See last time I tried, they decided to throw the book at me. All I was trying to do was reach downtown on my own and jump from a bridge. Well the police was called on me by a ""friend"" and the police showed up. Asked me a question. I technically lied to them. So they charged me with lying. But they still chased me and shot me with a taser to ""protect"" me I don't know. But the procedure for police here is anyone that goes in a police car must be handcuffed. So they treat you like a criminal to ""keep you safe"" yeah sure.

I just feel like I'm suicidal and it leads to everyone treating me differently and they keep threatening to send me to the hospital. I'm not going. I'm 33, I can make my own choices."

SuicideWatch,flekpaf,t1_flejqzl,1585086243.0,"In tears. Lol. Thank you. I have little words right now. Idk. I just want my pain to stop. That's all I ask of the world, is to let it stop. I just, I have to take care of my elderly mother. I love her, with all my heart. But being a caregiver for her, it takes it toll on me. Lately, thanks to the virus, I've been worried about losing her. We are not going to survive, me and her, and there is nothing I can do to keep her safe. My sister brings her kids over. I love them all but she is still working at a pharmacy so she is likely to get sick. She will pass it along to her kids and they will give it to my mom. I will lose her and when I do, I'm done in this world."
SuicideWatch,flejss2,t3_fod0ss,1585085746.0,"Wow. Your post, spoke to me. I come in here with the desire to help others with their problems but I can't seem to apply the same level of thinking when I'm the one who is down.

If you would like to talk please feel free to respond. I'll be around. :)"
SuicideWatch,flej5yo,t1_fleijk2,1585085402.0,"No need to be sorry. I'm just glad you liked the quote. Lol. Anyway, I hope you are feeling even slightly better. If you would like to talk, I will just listen. It's of course, your choice. Hope your day is at least a tolerable day. Bye."
SuicideWatch,fleiln2,t1_fleh6un,1585085093.0,"It's really is fine. Fine in the sense that my house is slowly burning down around me. I seek death to end a suffering that should never have happened to me. What I mean is that something I didn't add in there was that I was raped, repeatedly, by my father from age 5 to 11. I have the memories/emotions of the event. A feeling of being used. I was my father's play toy. He took from me my innocence. I grew up faster than most. I had to. 

I'm doing so horrible. I live with this dread. I can't go on like this anymore. I know there is no way you can really help me. I'm sorry I ranted there. Idk. Sorry."
SuicideWatch,fledwzo,t1_flecxg6,1585082519.0,Sorry. So so sorry. :( I wish I could take your pain away. I'm not gonna be able to get you out of debt but I can at least be here to listen to you. Wanna chat?
SuicideWatch,fledo8x,t3_fobwlj,1585082385.0,"Hey, I'm willing to be your friend. So you can have one. :) Wanna chat?"
SuicideWatch,fledgz7,t3_fobxrs,1585082275.0,"Should you go back to the hospital? Idk. Maybe or maybe not. I'm being told I should go in myself. I'm scared to death of it. I don't want the cops to be called on me and be treated like a criminal for wanting to off myself. 

Anyway, would you like to chat?"
SuicideWatch,fled95d,t3_fobzle,1585082153.0,I'm willing to talk to you. Would you like to chat?
SuicideWatch,fled509,t3_foc6ke,1585082088.0,"I heard someone say once, ""If my car breaks down, I have three options. Fix my car. Buy a new one. Or I could just kill myself."" Suicide is always an option to him. It sounds a lot like you. It really spoke to me and I hope it is the same for you. Idk. You can ignore me if you wish. :)"
SuicideWatch,flecr8z,t3_foc670,1585081876.0,"Hey there, would you like someone to talk to tonight? Maybe just someone to listen to you?"
SuicideWatch,flecn78,t3_foc5jf,1585081815.0,"Hey, you want a friend to talk to?"
SuicideWatch,flecky6,t3_fobnyy,1585081780.0,"Well discussing methods is against the rules.

That said, I am not here to try to talk you out of it. I'm here to just talk to you. What's going on tonight?"
SuicideWatch,fl98bn1,t3_fnf79p,1584944630.0,I'm only 33 but I'm pretty sure I have some understanding. Wanna chat?
