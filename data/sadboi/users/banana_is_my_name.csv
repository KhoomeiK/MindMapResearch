I started recovery earlier this year and my life has completely turned around for the better. I'm not going to say every day is perfect and my recovery was linear because that's not true at all. I know for a fact though that if I can make it through this, you can too.

I've come to avoid mirrors and cameras like the plague, and get really triggered by offhand comments like you experienced too. It really helped me to be real with my friends about my situation so they not only refrain from making comments, but they really support me gaining weight and keep reminding me how much more life I have now that I'm recovering. 

Please don't restrict again. You have so much more to you than how you look. I know it doesn't feel like that and it doesn't always feel like that to me too, but it's true.  The body is healing and gaining weight to its set point is inevitable no matter how many a person may relapse. I know it's hard but I hope you can push through. Things will get better ðŸ’“"

I've been in recovery for around 3 months now and let me tell you... the first two weeks I was so hot, especially at night, to the point where I'd wake up completely drenched in sweat. I got those hot flashes at least once a day for a few months but now it seems like my body temperature has stabilized and that doesn't happen as often anymore.

I'm not 100% sure about this but I think, since body temperate is largely regulated by your metabolism, your metabolism is just working to compensate for all of the extra fuel you are providing it. This can also be referred to as the thermic effect of food. After a while your body will adjust to the consistent source of fuel and you probably won't get hot flashes as often anymore!"

I've gone to office hours pretty regularly in the past but once the term ended I didn't see or otherwise communicate with that prof. Also, all of my (relevant) classes so far have had 100-300 people, so I'm pretty sure the profs I visited frequently didn't really know me anyway. 

How should I go about maintaining a relationship with a prof even after the term ends? Also, what do people mean when they say go to office hours regularly (like every week at least)?"

I'm sort of in a similar situation where I started recovery some months ago and binged my way from a low weight to almost overweight. I don't feel qualified to give you advice but in my case I think I'm still gaining and I might even become overweight but my relationship with food is slowly healing, because I gave myself unrestricted access to food. I still eat a ton but I hardly binge and I mostly eat healthy foods, even though at the beginning I only ate sweets and other junk. I also started getting my future goals back, which is slowly overpowering food as the most important thing in my life.
Believe me, my ED caused some scary, scary thoughts and even a month ago if I told myself I'd be at this weight now I'd probably have thought some very bad things too. But I kept letting myself eat anyway and I'm finally starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. You're definitely not alone in your battle ðŸ’“"
EDrecoverymemes,fn2buzt,t3_fyr8os,1586583763.0,"TW: weight gain (lbs), calories, recovery timeline


I decided to start recovery from AN shortly before quarantine began and once I was confined to my house I also literally ate 4000+ calories a day and like you, it was super unhealthy or high cal (jars and jars of peanut butter, nutella, cookies... Seems like we have similar cravings haha). Obviously by eating so much for weeks on end, I gained like 30 lbs in 8 weeks, which other people usually took many months or even years to gain, if they even gain that much at all. I thought there was something wrong with me cause I couldn't stop shoving my face with junk from dusk to dawn and I was still a bottomless pit the next day, even with this HUGE weight gain. 

But after a 2 months of recovery allowing myself to binge, stopping calorie counting, etc, the extreme hunger and mental hunger is mostly gone and I feel soooooooooooooooooooooooo much better. I'm obviously not recovered yet cause I started recovery only two months ago, but I'm naturally eating way less than 4000 calories now and I don't even crave sugar like I used to. I can't tell you I'm losing weight or anything like that because it hasn't been long enough to tell. But I finally feel like my body is trusting me more now. I even forget about food sometimes, which is so different from be before recovery, where I thought about food every second of every day. 

I know how you feel cause even two weeks ago I was feeling despondent from binging incessantly and feeling like a gigantic fat whale and triggering myself with old pics and feeling so alone and wanting to relapse so bad. But I guess all I can say is trust the process!! Your body is craving those unhealthy fatty, sugary foods because your body needs lipids (fats) and carbs to survive and heal itself. Glucose (sugar) is the easiest form of energy that your body can get and obviously your body is craving that because you've deprived yourself from energy for so long, so it wants the easiest form of fuel. Fats are vital for hormone rebalancing.  You are craving these things because your body needs them to repair itself after a period of restriction. Once your body trusts that you have a constant intake of food, it won't need the quickest form of fuel for fast energy or hormonal balance and cell repair, and your cravings may slowly subside. Science is doing this for you, not a lack of willpower. 

Sorry for the long response but you put in words what I was feeling so recently and I just wanted you to know you're not alone!!!!!!!! Sending you so much love, you're doing great ðŸ’“ðŸ’“ðŸ’“ðŸ’“ðŸ’“ðŸ’“"

fuckeatingdisorders,fm26bpa,t3_fsdpgt,1585691402.0,"I'm sort of in the same position as you right now. I started recovery like two months ago and my face has swelled so much that other people have commented on it. It makes me really self conscious and my face is wider than it was befoSre my ED and it's pretty hard to deal with. 

But I just try to remember that my friends and family don't care and most of them don't even notice that my face is a little wider than it used to be and they'd much rather be around me with a slightly puffy face and recovering than me with a thinner face and a terrible attitude towards everything (among other side effects of restricting).

Also, facial swelling during recovery is likely to go down eventually (though it might take months or even years to), or so I've heard. 

You can do it!!"

fuckeatingdisorders,fiqr3s0,t3_f9atkq,1582650180.0,"Hey OP, I don't have much advice to give you cause I'm in your exact situation. I almost feel like recovering and gaining weight is a waste of time if I'm not fixing what's happening inside mentally. For me, I was going to go talk to my GP to see if I can get a referral to a psychiatrist to treat my mental health only, in addition to what I'm already doing from my ED (doctor and dietician). Even though the two problems are really intertwined for me, tackling them as separate entities might work for you in this case too (so you're not sacrificing one for the other).  I live in a country with free healthcare + student healthcare, which completely cover any of these services I need, though.
I don't know if that helped at all but in any case, you're not alone in your struggle. You can do it ðŸ’“ðŸ’“"
EatingDisorders,fi61wlc,t1_fi5v9u6,1582176365.0,"I guess ""fully recover"" is different for everyone, so sorry about the vagueness.  What I meant, more specifically, could be...

Mentally: not thinking about food all the time, able to eat without tracking calories, food doesn't invoke stress, etc.

Physically: period has returned (if it was ever gone), hunger cues are ""normal"", weight has plateaued, etc.

These are just some general things I am striving for in my recovery. I know they may be achieved at different times and they probably differ for everyone, though!"
