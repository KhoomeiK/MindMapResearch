Eg Jacinda put us into lockdown very quickly when we had about 200 cases/0 deaths. It was also made a notifiable disease before it reached here. 

Ireland went into lockdown with 20+ deaths and 1000 cases+. It was not made notifiable till after it reached Ireland.

At the end of the day, although I am pretty satisfied with how our government has responded to the pandemic, I know we also had a lot of luck and other factors on our side eg being geographically isolated.

However, many people lose interest after the novelty of a puppy or new dog, and the poor thing ends up ignored, unexercised and having a shit quality of life.

At two months in, I personally would have already discussed whether or not we were exclusive. Having said that, at this point in time I find it a bit weird that she didn’t check with you first. Did you discuss what you were both looking for? Is she just wanting to have fun without anything serious? 

Either way, I don’t think you were rash but the situation is potentially salvageable if you both have a frank discussion about it and set up boundaries that you are both comfortable with.

Edit: sorry, just reread your post. So you already told her that you were looking for something serious and she slept with someone else? Seems like she doesn’t respect you very much. It’s up to you whether you want to try again with her but I think this is a red flag."
