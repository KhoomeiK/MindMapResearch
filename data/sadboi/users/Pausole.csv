Yeah, no, sorry not sorry, this is not how you will convince me. I've been playing this game for three years now. I've played most if not all archetypes and by far cycle decks have been the most forgiving ones.

I've explained why I believe so. You didn't explain anything except ""pros have said it"". I forge my own opinions. Again, if someone is convincing I'll listen. You're not convincing.

My deck has a higher skillcap than cycle decks because my cards are not 1 or 2 elixir and that I can't just cycle back instantly if I happen to mess up. Because if someone plays a Pekka or a MK or whatever I can't just spam random low cost minions in the middle. Because if I'm caught out of rotation I just lose. Because I actually have to think whether or not I should play my cards and how.

Btw, how well or how bad I do when I play cycle decks doesn't change a thing about the skillcap of said decks. I could be the best cycle player on Earth, or the worst, and it would be the same. You're resorting to ad hominem ""arguments"". Is that also supposed to convince me?"

I ""don't try winning"" a GC or CC with a cycle deck because I don't have fun playing them. I used to play them, precisely because they were easy and F2P-friendly. Guess what? I've always done well with them. But they're boring to me so why I would force myself to play them?

Doesn't matter what deck I play. You are going to insult me whatever I answer but the truth is I could be playing ANYTHING it wouldn't change a thing about how cycle decks are braindead. But no, I don't play golem. I know that's what people commonly assume but it's false."

I'm done arguing with you, we're just going in circles. I guess I'm different from most other people. When I play something braindead I have no issue admitting it but for some reason cycle users are all convinced to be playing something super skillful when they're not.

Use the wishlist in the tavern. It guarantees that on your next tavern pulls you'll get one of the heroes in your wishlist. It's important to fill all 5 slots to that effect. Only wishlist ascended heroes. They are the heroes that can be leveled above 160. You can see who is who in the ""portraits"" window in the heroes panel.

Important heroes you'll want for sure are Lucius (he's a tank and a healer at the same time, absolutely amazing unit), Belinda, Ferael / Eironn / Safiya (lategame heroes but you'll be happy to have copies of them later, trust me), Lyca, Tasi and Fawkes.

About lab coins, focus on Shem first then Wukong. But the thing is it will take you very long to get Wukong copies. Depending on what heroes you pull later you might consider swapping him. Or just hold on to him until Shemira is lvl 161. She'll be your second tank then.

This game is fairly generous you'll get your heroes eventually. Only use cristals to do x10 pulls in the tavern."
afkarena,fpktax4,t3_gdxixr,1588700666.0,"Put Wukong in the frontline and Shem in the backline. Swap them. Your Shem is still early game and until lvl 161+ she's too squishy to be played as a tank.

Brutus - Wukong frontline / Shem - Rowan in the middle - Rosa

But there's not much else you can do. Your team is indeed underleveled and behind in ascension levels. Afk a bit and farm resources to make your team stronger. You have very good heroes that you will use until the end of the game.

Your main priority should be Shemira. You could consider overleveling Saveas and using him because he's stronger than her for now but his max level is 160. Coincidentally lvl 161 is when Shemira really starts to shine so when you get there swap them. Shem Rosa is solid though and your Shem is elite + so if that works for you just focus on getting resources.

Keep Eironn, Skriath and Safiya but they're lategame heroes so you won't need them for now. Nara is a beast too. Grezhul, Tidus and Gorvo are mostly used in the faction towers but they're not bad. Thane falls off hard. Raine is powercreeped by Rowan and Rosa. Nemora is very good but she's a bit redundant when you have Rowan already.
