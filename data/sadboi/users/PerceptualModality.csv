There's such a focus on strict obedience that we don't let horses think for themselves anymore. For me, it's a big reason why we're seeing so many more fatal accidents now. The sport is too fast and the horses are trained to respond like robots. It's not really the purpose of eventing which was to show off a talented military horse and rider combo.

Even the jumpers are changing a lot. I would coach my students and do the occasional jumper show in my eventing days and the pacing at the lower height classes is wild. Where are the training foundations? The lower classes were just kids galloping around on fancy horses and being saved by them at every fence. I hated when my students would do a nice ride around the course, getting their distances right, making sensible decisions on course and then get beat by some kid flying around the ring with a horse that is scopey enough to take them over the fence even though the rider didn't set them up properly at all.

blogsnark,fpaaoy8,t1_fpa4u03,1588444247.0,I'll admit I've been seeing bits and pieces here and there but they did a bit in some kind of speed dating thing and it was so cringey because some of the women were so clearly uncomfortable with what was happening.  One of the guys had to stare uncomfortably at a woman's cleavage and say weird things to her and she looked soooo uncomfortable and like she wanted to get out of there. It's hard to explain really why it bothers me but I also hate cringey things and feel serious second hand embarrassment so I've never really been a fan of the show.
blogsnark,fpaa5na,t1_fpa9bm2,1588443929.0,I have no idea yet... I wasn't planning on doing one but honestly with the pandemic and my ADHD I need the extra help and failing the bar will end up costing me a lot more in the long run than taking a course but I don't want to spend toooooo much money
blogsnark,fp9ym9y,t3_gc1pl1,1588437254.0,This is so random but my SO is rewatching old episodes of impractical jokers and I can't help but feel sooooooo much second hand discomfort for the women on that show. Some of the jokes have not aged well at allllll.

I'm Canadian so I think the bar exams aren't as bad here, but I'm not looking forward to it. I am probably going toj sign up for a course just to keep accountable because I self studied for the LSAT and that was really hard for me to manage without the whole pandemic thing going on."

I'm going to be doing a year long clerkship starting this summer and then hope the economy is a little better.

I am feeling sad that I can't really celebrate. I got takeout last night which was a treat but I ended up eating alone because the delivery arrived way earlier than we thought it would and he was doing something on a game. I could have waited so we could at least eat a meal together but idk I just don't really care anymore these days."
TrollXChromosomes,fp9sr1h,t1_fp89uxt,1588433784.0,"Also - don't these guys grow up living in houses?  Don't they at least have SOME idea about what needs to be done so they can educate themselves on how to do it?  Why does someone need to teach them how to load a dishwasher?  They know they eat off of dishes right?  Can't they put two and two together to figure out those dishes need to be washed and take it upon themselves to learn how to do that?    


I've taught myself all kinds of things using youtube."
TrollXChromosomes,fp9s7b3,t1_fp9ny79,1588433449.0,"Oh my god I would have lost it.  My SO pulls the ""I don't know where this goes"" card a lot too.  YOU LIVE HERE?!?!?!  How do you not know where the food - that you also eat - goes?  Take a look around and figure it out!"
TrollXChromosomes,fp9rxbr,t1_fp8oddi,1588433281.0,"Ahh I'm really feeling this frustration with Mother's Day coming up.  Somehow I'm now in charge of gift for my mother and my SO's mother because he doesn't care.  I guess I could just not care as well, but it would hurt her feelings so much if nothing happened and she's already really stressed because of the pandemic.  
My SO is a terrible gift giver and it's 100% due to laziness. For Christmas, I have to create lists for him with exactly what I want, where you can buy it, right down to where it will be located in the store.  I have to research all this stuff and I know it's a first world problem, but it's annoying because it's an obligation that I have on top of shopping for both of our families.  I would rather just buy stuff for myself.  Getting gifts from him is a hassle."
TrollXChromosomes,fp9rj3w,t1_fp8yp2c,1588433040.0,"Ugh for real though - like somehow me being a woman makes me more innately aware of these things.  I sometimes believe that my SO thinks that I do chores and take care of the house as a hobby, because I don't have as much time for hobbies as he does and I spend more of my ""down time"" doing things like cleaning, fixing things, or prepping meals.  It's not because these are my hobbies and this is how I want to spend my free time.  It's what needs to be done to have the quality of life I want.   I would do more hobbies if I had the time, but I don't."
TrollXChromosomes,fp9qwr1,t1_fp9er46,1588432659.0,"Exactly - most fathers don't ask for custody.  If it's contested, the court considers who is already doing the care work, who follows up with Dr appointments, who takes them to activities, who is speaking with their teachers, etc.  It's usually mothers doing this work, so the courts tend to keep the parent who is actually parenting as the primary caregiver.  It's not some grand conspiracy - it's that fathers aren't doing nearly as much parenting as they think they are doing."
TrollXChromosomes,fp9qphc,t1_fp9juds,1588432536.0,"Wow that sounds very similar to what I'm dealing with, although I just have a list on a small whiteboard on the fridge with all the things we need.  I get your frustration... My SO doesn't really seem to be respecting that although we're both home all the time, I'm working from home and he is not.  He has all the time in the world to learn this stuff and I'm honestly getting tired of the advice that I have to teach him things because ""men don't grow up learning this stuff""."
TrollXChromosomes,fp97jf0,t1_fp7riwv,1588417338.0,Those MGTOW types to complain about sexist courts are so infuriating. Are there situations of some kind of genuine injustice? Sure. But most of the time judges award custody to the parent who has been doing all the work. Why would they send the kids to live with the parent who doesn't seem interested in taking care of them?
TrollXChromosomes,fp97asv,t1_fp802tk,1588417083.0,"I'm right there with you. My SO was the designated grocery shopper during the pandemic but I'm now going to do the shopping again because I'm so tired of him ""forgetting"" everything we need. He seems to think I have this magical ability of remembering all the food in the house so I'm better at doing the shopping anyways."
TrollXChromosomes,fp96nsr,t1_fp8g4sr,1588416393.0,"That's such a cop out excuse as well because so many things around the house need to be done correctly and on certain schedules in order to have a functioning household. It's not being a ""perfectionist"" its maintaining a decent standard of living. I kinda think a lot of straight men live their lives blissfully unaware of all of the labour involved in maintaining a household, especially if they move from living with their mothers to living with their wives or girlfriends."
blogsnark,fovjwt5,t1_fovj6z9,1588102572.0,Idk we have this kind of problem all the time but it's matter of degrees. I accept that things will never be exactly even but it really sucks when I'm working all day every day 7 days a week and he's on his Nintendo DS smoking weed all day
blogsnark,fovjaep,t1_foviu40,1588102269.0,Seriously this would be incredible. I'm so tried of every night getting him off the couch to do anything. Once I'm done exams this week I'm just going to start getting my own food or something. If he wants to live like roommates the I guess so be it.
blogsnark,fov538u,t1_fov202u,1588095517.0,"No I don't think so.  He's just lazy and doesn't care much for anything other than his immediate needs.  He works, has friends, takes care of himself... just doesn't do one iota of anything outside of what HE considers necessary."
blogsnark,fov0dpb,t1_fouxzzc,1588093336.0,"Omg you hit the nail on the head.  I'm so exhausted and burned out caring for other people and I have none of my usual coping skills available to me.  I just want someone to do something nice for me without me having to ask and beg and cry and still get about 30% effort from him.  Honestly even just like making me a frozen lean cuisine would be a step in the right direction, but he's not even capable of that because it requires foresight and planning and he just flat out refuses to do it.

I just would love to be able to have SOMETHING be off of my plate.  Anything.  I would fucking love just to have a clean surface in my house or a meal cooked for me so I don't have to eat another sandwich or heat up a can of soup and crackers for myself. Even a frozen lasagna or something would be a dream right now - to have someone figure out what we will eat, make sure we have it, and just have the food there.  Instead, I emerge from my office where I've been all fucking day, ask him what the plan is for dinner (while he sits on the couch playing Pokemon and smoking weed all day) and then have to problem solve with him because he didn't spend one minute thinking about it.  Then we look around the kitchen, and there's nothing really here to eat because he hasn't gone out for groceries in 10 days and didn't think about what we would need to eat, and I just give up and make myself a peanut butter sandwich for dinner.  I've already had a peanut butter sandwich for lunch, but the alternative is that I figure out and cook an entire meal with whatever odds and ends we have here and I just don't want to do it because I'm just so tired and burned out and why should it be me doing this at 8PM????"
blogsnark,fouzgds,t1_foutgst,1588092908.0,"I honestly don't know anymore.  It is super disrespectful.  He has all the time in the world to do this, he just doesn't see it as important because he is ok to eat cereal and pbj all day every day and live in a dirty house."
