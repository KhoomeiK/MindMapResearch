mentalhealth,fprc6k4,t3_gf4ia6,1588849866.0,"Why not enjoy the one time you'll only ever live. Be whatever you want, dont worry about what others think as they too will die after living their one life and so on. But while we are here, live the shit out of it. 

Life wont give you anything unless you go get it. Only you and no one else can do this."

AskReddit,fppvdej,t1_fppuezk,1588809890.0,"You could be right I'm not 100%.  The part before the big bang itself, Any idea what they say it is? Or is it ""something"", unknown with no theory, and everything just starts/ begins at the big bang."
AskReddit,fpprpv0,t1_fppqri2,1588807862.0,"I agree.  Everything else starts off as a theory, is there any theory or idea on this? 

Then I think maybe it's just too mind boggling to think about.  Having to accept the universe came from absolutely nothing, is hard."

Physics,fp1ux50,t3_gaua2o,1588248505.0,"Looking at the graph 
, it does not start at 0 and goes down instantly so my guess is either, b or c, as they start ""off"" the ground not on the ground. I'd say the parachute guy. But not 100%."

First ever picture of a black hole was only last year, amazing!. Knowing it was there all along with only evidence of activity around it. Wow. Dark matter also baffles me, it's so interestingly weird lol."

mentalhealth,fmaduo4,t3_fu261s,1585890960.0,I can also relate to almost everything you have said here. You will get passed it. Just keep your head up.  Try something new ( I know we are restricted with covid 19) Stay positive as much as you can as hard as it feels.

socialskills,fki7i4h,t3_finkix,1584213468.0,"If they ignore you and leave you out. They are not your friends. Friends make you feel good, help you with every day situations and tell you your wrong if you are , lol. Dont feel like your cant make friends. You need to stay positive, I 100% believe they're is a group of friends waiting for you to bump into and will prob be when you least expect it, which means you need to be able to feel good about yourself first. 
It's not easy when you feel so low, I know this trust me, but I assure you, once you start to feel better as your own person of who you are inside, on the spectrum or not your the only one that can provide this for yourself. Self happiness is essential to any happiness. And if you need an online friend, I'm friendly enough ðŸ˜Š"
