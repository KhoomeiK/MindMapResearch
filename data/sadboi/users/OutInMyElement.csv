I had a next door neighbor threaten to kill me, and stalk/harass me for 2 years. I got a protective order, he was arrested multiple times, and plead guilty. 

Prior to me moving to the condos, he had punched a process server in the face on property, been arrested, and attempted to sue to police department. 

Unfortunately, despite his history of behavior and threats, one of the board members continued to support him. She came to my door at 6am, and told me that I should consider moving as I wasn’t welcome in the community and I was causing problems. 

I filed a request that since I have aspergers, I don’t want any board members showing up alone on my porch. I advised I would be happy to meet with a notice. 

Next thing you know, the mans sister calls me, because the board member gave her my cell phone number from condo records. She was demanding to know why I was doing this to her brother. I advised her she was breaking a protective order if she was contacting me about that. 

The neighbor went back to jail, and even in jail, the board member sent him postcards with other information saying they hoped I would move soon. I know, because the guy actually filed them with the courts (thinking it would support him in some capacity.)

Throughout all of this, he was going through foreclosure. They spent two years trying to settle with this guy because some board members were friends with him.

This photo was taken on I-44 about 10 miles east of Joplin (headed west to Oklahoma) when it hit by that big tornado in 2011 or whenever that was. 

My friend and I were driving and I pointed out how nasty the weather looked. Flipped on the radio and they said the storm was hitting Joplin. At that moment we passed a sign that Joplin was 10 miles away.

We just kept driving. Pulled into Joplin, and the first responders were just getting out. There was there huge rainbow over the area we were in.
