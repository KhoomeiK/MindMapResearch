But here are some other questions I have for you if you would like to answer. How are the 40 days in the wilderness with the devil and JESUS geographically possible? Mount Everest is the tallest mountain. Was that the mountain the devil took JESUS up upon to show him "" the kingdoms of the Earth.'? JESUS was in the middle east, NOT asia. And even if the devil DID take JESUS up mount everest, it doesn't show the whole world.  No mountain ever could. Why? The world is round. The Earth curves. Also, if the old testament commands to stone people for breaking the law was meant to be followed, who would have been left to stone to death the last person after everyone else had been killed since no one can follow the law perfectly? Also, ephesians says that we are saved by grace through fatih and not of works. But when JESUS was asked how to get to heaven, he told them to sell all of their goods and give to the poor. Those are works......"
