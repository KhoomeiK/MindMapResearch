genderqueer,fpa7oyn,t3_gc9fed,1588442489.0,That's great OP! So happy for you! Overall gang all here! I bought some recently for the same reason. It makes me feel more comfortable in my identity.
BananaFish,fp9u5mp,t1_fp9tls3,1588434616.0,Thanks!
BananaFish,fp9sw2v,t1_fp8zbhk,1588433868.0,Thanks! I love it. And yeah I think there's plenty of us who will never be over Banana Fish.
BananaFish,fp8rl9h,t1_fp8rgtq,1588400680.0,Thanks. Ash is life.

pansexual,fp8mr5t,t3_gc01d5,1588396530.0,Can't go wrong with either. You look beautiful!
BananaFish,fp8me3v,t3_gbxq1c,1588396227.0,"I was watching it on Amazon as the episodes were released... I never saw the last episode because I knew what would happen. This year I finally watched it. 

The first thing I did after crying my face off was get a full forearm tattoo of Ash. 

It may not be normal but there's plenty of us attached."
pansexual,fp75a6j,t3_gbj61p,1588364306.0,Yes let's.
clevercomebacks,folihoz,t1_folh4s2,1587862946.0,Now it makes sense. Thanks.
bipolar,fohlwhb,t1_fohlob5,1587768141.0,Yeah I think it's been brought up a few times recently but the mod mindset seems to be flairs and filters. It's really unfortunate that it isn't being taken seriously. At least I feel.
bipolar,fohkthf,t1_fohkmmi,1587767628.0,I'm sorry it makes you feel the way too.
bipolar,fohi57p,t3_g7e58f,1587766374.0,Awww! Yas! This is the type of content I'm paying for. It's so adorable.
bipolar,fohah6d,t1_fohaaxm,1587762719.0,Yup but hey maybe I'll start clogging this sub with my fanfiction. See if I can farm a few upvotes for my art.
bipolar,foh9z9j,t1_foh9mh9,1587762489.0,I think r/bipolarreddit is another group. I just scanned it bc somebody else tagged it and joined. It seems more serious about discussing bipolar problems and less talent show.
bipolar,foh53zp,t1_foh4w2s,1587760642.0,Thank you for listening.
bipolar,foh4a4t,t1_foh3e8m,1587760365.0,"In all honesty I'd like to talk to others with bipolar struggles here. Medication experiences and questions. Maybe newly diagnosed people looking for advice. Shared experiences with insomnia, bipolar spending, not adhering to meds... Etc. 

I thought that's what this was for. 

Bipolar art can go in its own r/. And those who want both types of content can sub to both. 

I didn't sub here to see other people's art. As beautiful and creative as the art might be. It's usually the last thing I wanna see after laying in bed for 7 days straight without a shower. Like great, others with bipolar can handle life that much better than me. They can even create masterpieces out of the madness that only drowns me."
bipolar,foh13q6,t1_foh0ulz,1587759321.0,"I think the point is there is a bipolar art subreddit for this type of thing. Not that it's not good or enjoyable, but keep it in the right place maybe?"
bipolar,fogk97w,t3_g7a2xp,1587753629.0,I'm with you. Getting reaaaaaallly tired of all the art. Like great you can produce something out of the madness. We don't all wanna see it every single day.
penpals,fnv0o6m,t3_g413ud,1587276479.0,Hi! I'm interested! I'll dm you?
pansexual,fnraac9,t3_g3atw9,1587183244.0,Awesome!
pansexual,fnr76ry,t3_g3cn1r,1587180989.0,You're so pretty!
pansexual,fnol80n,t3_g2y56t,1587128099.0,Wooo welcome!
pansexual,fnn8zeg,t1_fnn8k6y,1587087035.0,"Thank you. Though back to your rant, you didn't deserve to be bombarded as you were or made to feel uncomfortable. 

Everything is a spectrum. Perhaps sexuality does matter to you more than it does to me. 

My experience is my experience. Yours is yours."
pansexual,fnn6t4o,t1_fnn6fm8,1587085662.0,"My attraction is my own. It's up to me whether I share that with another or not. Their feelings have nothing to do with my attraction. 

Once you turn that attraction into action, then you consider the other person's feelings and so on. 

And yet, still, regardless of whether the attraction is mutual, it does not change my ability to be attracted or fall in love with others regardless of their sexuality."
pansexual,fnn6cep,t1_fnn67iu,1587085371.0,"Yeah, that's fine, but it doesn't change the part where I am attracted to all regardless of their sexuality, which is the part we were talking about."
pansexual,fnn65o4,t1_fnn4vvd,1587085255.0,"Doesn't change my attraction though. Whether they're interested or not, I'm still attracted to them."
pansexual,fnmuy8y,t1_fnmuos6,1587078652.0,"Agreed. I mean if I rank my pan attractions gay men are my #1s. I'm pans and genderqueer. Totally fluid in what, who I am l, and my attractions and sexuality plays a role in the level of attraction but it excludes nobody."
pansexual,fnmredy,t1_fnmp547,1587076714.0,Yeah bc I ID as pans and I don't rly care as long they're human I can be attracted to them. It's kinda hard to say I wouldn't be attracted to somebody if their sexuality was X ...
pansexual,fnmiunm,t3_g2m6qa,1587072210.0,"Being harassed like that is wrong but on another note I was also under the impression that pans did cover being attracted to humans regardless of gender, sexuality, identity, ECT ECT."

BipolarReddit,fneyfqd,t1_fneww9v,1586898147.0,"Yeah hope not. It's great for when the insomnia hits imo and experience. I just hate not being ""productive"" so sometimes I'd rather not sleep than sleep too much. But that's another personal issue to deal with."
BipolarReddit,fnewl0u,t3_g1chpn,1586897204.0,Great if you wanna sleep your life away. I was on 150 and I'd sleep a great 23 hours a day. I'm on 50 now and it gets really hard to get up and motivated to do anything. But that could be the depression talking. I do sleep when I take it though.
BipolarReddit,fnewc4b,t3_g1cmsn,1586897074.0,I take buspirone for anxiety. All that changed for me was I now have the ability to leave my house. Or did anyhow before this lockdown.

bipolar,fncfu40,t3_g0sbkx,1586835725.0,"Yes. I've often done it. Doesn't matter the time, weather, what I'm wearing. If I get really upset I start literally walking away from my problem. Usually after a fight or argument."
