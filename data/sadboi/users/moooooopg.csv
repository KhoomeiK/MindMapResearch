Then use this info to see if you need to reduce or increase the amount of food you need : you can calculate how much your currently eating by taking one of your logged days and adding up the kcals in each food, then reduce it by 100 kcals for the day if you want to lose, increase by 100 if you want to gain . If you don't want to count Cal's, just take away a food item (i.e. sugar in coffee, butter on toast, yogurt with lunch) monitor your weight for 2 weeks, reduce or increase food if you are not seeing results.
