relationships,fm8xitf,t3_ftrtdc,1585857860.0,Arguments/ discussions are good to have in a relationship because communication is key. It’s worse when you just hold it in!
relationships,fm8qwuv,t3_ftpruu,1585854353.0,"Stay the fuck away from that. You deserve to be with a man who sees you as beautiful inside and out. Don’t be a “I guess I’ll try that out” kind of girl. You deserve way better. Because if you were to go with him, who knows he could be emotionally abusive or you could be stuck in a relationship for him time after time with comments like that to bring you down. Absolutely not."
relationships,fm8qj5s,t3_ftrtdc,1585854150.0,"In this situation, your reaction is warranted. I feel that it would be best to sit down with your girlfriend and tell her how you feel. Bring up the point about how that would make her feel if the situation was reversed. If she knows that they want to get with her and that it is hurting you, she should distant herself away to make you feel more comfortable. I don’t think you are being controlling if you voice your concerns."
relationships,fm8pzz6,t3_fts47a,1585853873.0,"Get therapy. Stop hurting others. I will say though it’s the right step to acknowledge that you want to stop this cycle. I hope you stop cheating altogether, it’s not a good look."
AskReddit,flc3gqy,t3_fnszg7,1585018936.0,When I had to take a survey at the hospital I work at. The survey asked how long I could go without going home from none to 96 hours.
HappyTrees,fgtxjp9,t3_ezbxs0,1581110716.0,Makes sense! Also you’re awesome for giving advice!! I honestly would’ve continued burning my already nonexistent nose hairs and everyone else that is in my house from using acetone haha. I just bought an odorless turpenoid from amazon and more brushes so we’ll see how they goes!
HappyTrees,fgsuk60,t3_ezbxs0,1581092957.0,"Yes it def does!! I have that issue of over lending probably cuz I never used paint thinner!! Also do you clean your brushes in between and with what stuff? Cuz currently I have this horrific smelling acetone solution that I try to use at the end of painting, but I’m wondering if that’s another reason why it’s not turning right. Thanks!"
HappyTrees,fgrevfc,t3_ezbxs0,1581045105.0,Wow. That’s amazing! I just started doing bob Ross paintings!! Your painting is so crisp! How do you get the definition like that. I have a hard time making the trees that defined. What’s your technique?
TheMindIlluminated,faq2hgc,t3_ea7498,1576296917.0,Yay!! Congrats! I hope to get to this point. At what page do you recommend starting to learn how to properly meditate? Thanks!

AskWomen,f8wvu2o,t3_e1jesv,1574901300.0,"I'm a nurse. I practice self-care by going pee whenever I feel the urge to because if I hold it in, it'll be the entire shift before I get a chance to. Oh and also taking a break from my unit and sitting in the quiet room watching shows on netflix or hulu."

AskReddit,f8qgl0y,t1_f8qga0k,1574717430.0,what about a koala instead?
AskReddit,f8qg685,t1_f8qfvvw,1574717230.0,"Yeah nope and NOOOO. I can't stand the way snakes look with their non-prominent noses haha. You should get yourself a cute kitten at the local animal shelter, I'm sure they give them away for free if it's overcrowded."
AskReddit,f8qfsxk,t1_f8qfe92,1574717059.0,"AWEEE, :,(. You should get yourself a dog at your local animal shelter. Dogs will love you forever until they die! Unless you're allergic then settle for a cat, but honestly dogs> cats"
AskReddit,f8qfsbb,t1_f8qdrdb,1574717051.0,"No no, I think thats a good estimation! At first I was like who's sad, but then realized you meant to say dad haha. Whoops!"

AskReddit,f8qdxq9,t1_f8qb21y,1574716180.0,One of those float tanks ?!  Yeah tried that once...enough to know that it would be my first and last time doing that. What makes you like it?
AskReddit,f8qadi5,t1_f8q9uk5,1574714595.0,Well the good thing is more money to treat yourself :)
AskReddit,f8qa9yv,t1_f8q9oqo,1574714550.0,Hmm i guess the amount differs per how much you like the person haha. So in total how much?
Michigan,f8qa5w5,t1_f8oxxcj,1574714498.0,Thanks for the suggestion! Definitely loving how its close to so many diff places. The only issue is that my fiance is favorable to West Michigan since his parents are also going to relocate there.
PassNclex,f81zxw2,t1_f80tmrg,1574181026.0,"My best advice is the day before DO NOT STUDY ANYTHING NURSING RELATED. go treat yourself for all that studying by going to get a massage, hang with your loved ones and friends. Do some breathing exercises during the exam when you feel stress and take one question at a time. Also get uworld haha."
PassNclex,f7z6ogh,t3_dxuole,1574106169.0,Yes! I'm thinking back to the time of when I took the nclex. Please invest in Uworld. It's amazing!! Also remember don't let anxiety get to you. The Nclex is easier than you think it is.
Anxiety,f7z6fs8,t3_dy6hb6,1574106048.0,You guys got this!! Keep at it. The fact that you guys are taking the step to work at marriage is amazing.
self,f7t6mg3,t3_dvz5wa,1574001430.0,Thanks! It does make you look at life very differently. Appreciate every moment but don’t be mad at yourself if you find that it’s hard to live in the moment. Time will honestly heal the hurt. Think of your dad of all the good memories and know that he passed with all his loved ones around him. Some people don’t even have that privilege. Like I said I’m here if you need to just vent or talk.
self,f7mcggk,t3_dvz5wa,1573859591.0,"Fuck. Please just take each day at a time. If you need someone to talk to, pm me. Death is never easy."
self,f7hecek,t3_dw3c51,1573738898.0,"I hate to say this but you’re putting yourself in misery and agony. You deserve that same happiness but not with her. She has moved on as you have said. You deserve to move on. I suggest blocking her for all social media. Getting rid of all the things that remind you of her like shirts, bands, etc and most importantly distracting yourself. It will take time but it’s important that you heal. She’s not the right one and there definitely is the right girl for you out there that will love you even more. It will happen but first take care of yourself!"
self,f7he0in,t3_dw55n5,1573738696.0,"It’s okay that college isn’t your thing. You gave it your all especially when it’s something that your passionate about. Try pursuing something that brings you joy and if necessary work a diff job that you enjoy that will help supplement your hobby. It’s okay, college isn’t for everyone. The one thing in life is to pursue happiness. We really do have one life to live and it’s beautiful when you focus on all the things you have. Try finishing this semester up and sit down and talk to your parents. Tell them how you feel."
self,f7hdrs9,t3_dw5p08,1573738546.0,"Have you tried meditation? Look up vipisanna meditation. I haven’t tried it yet but really want to when I find time to just go on a 10 day break from phones and the hustle and bustle of life. Theres actually a free course you sign up to ahead of time because slots fill fast that allow you to meditate for 10 days straight, yeah... that sounds very very boring but ppl swear by it!"
self,f7hdhqe,t3_dvz5wa,1573738379.0,"Hi there! Any update in your dad? How are you doing as well? I know these events can be really traumatic, rightfully so. Make sure you also take time to take care of yourself. If your dads in the hospital for a lengthy stay, take time to get outside and smell the fresh air, eat, shower, and then come back in."
self,f7hd904,t3_dvvghz,1573738229.0,"Girl, I grew up like this too and had this exact thought. You’re not selfish, all you want is for your mom to spend time with you and to show you love without being bought things. You are not as selfish as you think. Ppl are innately selfish. As hard as it is try working on forgiveness. Once you forgive your mom focus on repairing it if possible. My mom and I’s relationship is stronger than it was before when I was 19 top but it began by accepting the fact that she and my dad had to work to provide a good future for my brother and I. Now she has time and I have a little bit of time too and just going on dog walks with her have helped repair it slowly. It’s a process. You have to learn to love. I hope all is well."
self,f7hctvr,t3_dw0rei,1573737973.0,Try distracting yourself or surrounding yourself with friends. I’m really sorry that you’re experiencing hurt right now. It’s never fun. Working out and therapy are two things that I swear by. Just even going outside for a hike or a walk may help for a bit. Time will heal. Baby steps :)
