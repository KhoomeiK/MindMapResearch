philosophy,fbf09j6,t1_fbdryzh,1576798257.0,"I like the stoics, but i find it hard to disagree with Nietzsche:

"""" 

You desire to LIVE ""according to Nature""? Oh, you noble Stoics, what fraud of words! Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature, boundlessly extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without purpose or consideration, without pity or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain: imagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE as a power--how COULD you live in accordance with such indifference? To live--is not that just endeavoring to be otherwise than this Nature? Is not living valuing, preferring, being unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different? And granted that your imperative, ""living according to Nature,"" means actually the same as ""living according to life""--how could you do DIFFERENTLY? Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be? In reality, however, it is quite otherwise with you: while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature, you want something quite the contrary, you extraordinary stage-players and self-deluders! In your pride you wish to dictate your morals and ideals to Nature, to Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein; you insist that it shall be Nature ""according to the Stoa,"" and would like everything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal glorification and generalism of Stoicism! With all your love for truth, you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such hypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY, that is to say, Stoically, that you are no longer able to see it otherwise-- and to crown all, some unfathomable superciliousness gives you the Bedlamite hope that BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over yourselves--Stoicism is self-tyranny--Nature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: is not the Stoic a PART of Nature? . . . But this is an old and everlasting story: what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens today, as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the will to ""creation of the world,"" the will to the causa prima.

\-In tes6, the  Imperial empire will fall (Redfall) and theKalpa will end.- ALthough the fall of the empire will be inevitable, the redguard/hammerfell story will be how some will survive the new kalpa

\-The end of the Kalpa might involve the eye of magnus and the psyjiic monks. The end of the Kalpa might also involve the direnni tower/adamantium tower, the last known (and most important) tower in tamriel.

\- With the destruction of the towers, Nirn and time itself might come undone. The world will die and a new world will begin.
