Journaling,fnr0sw7,t1_fnqke7l,1587176567.0,I definitely did not think it was a pen at first
RoastMe,fnqjpjo,t3_g3b1br,1587165974.0,No one is going to talk about how heavily you edited your skin?! Wtff
Stims,fnqjccr,t3_g3akcj,1587165763.0,"As a woman I can handle being with a man who uses. My man does frequently although I'm sober. It's the porn that causes relationship issues. Porn addiction is real and serious. As the girlfriend of a man who will sometimes get high and jerk it for hours on end, I suggest you get help for that porn addiction. I do resent him for it sometimes."
JUSTNOMIL,fnpufjb,t1_fnpsura,1587152199.0,She is family. He doesn't want me to go no contact. He just doesn't want to have to deal with her so he makes me. If she shows up at the house he makes me answer the door. If he needs her for something he makes me call her etc
JUSTNOMIL,fnprll0,t1_fnpqsms,1587150715.0,"He's not though. If it wasn't for me, they would never speak. He has been no contact for over a month. Mainly due to her smothering and also some other little drama between them. I am her only form of contact to him as he has her blocked. So I hear from her at least 5 times a day. Which is fine besides having to hear her gush over SO."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fnm49nc,t3_g1rmyd,1587064832.0,"Yes I left him one day and he showed up at the house I was at looking for me. We refused to let him in so he slit his wrists right then and there. Screamed outside for a while then finally left, with a trail of blood on the sidewalk all the way back to his car.

I know everyone advocates awareness for self harm and mental health. And sure in normal circumstances you should call police.

BUT. When you are with a guy like this, you already know the show he's about to put on before he even starts. A couple shallow slits on the arm and maybe a bit deeper one for the dramatic effect....to him that is worth it if it means you care enough to call in the police for his safety and acknowledge the actions!"
BPD,fnlqbgj,t3_g2j5m8,1587057890.0,"I don't think any of these are really sure things. A good way to tell is to look at your emotional and relationship patterns. A lot more goes into it and we can't help self diagnose you. But if you feel you have BPD tech out to a professional. Many are doing video appointments. Please, especially if you are suddenly seeing how cutting one's self could ""kill"" your emptiness."
AskParents,fnbwjjr,t3_g0uvg6,1586823734.0,"This is very odd to me also. I have never seen anyone do this. If a friend sent me a link to a birthday registry for their one year old, I would be taken aback. To me that says, ""buy my child a gift but specifically THESE gifts."" At that point it's hardly a gift anymore. It would really rub me the wrong way unlike a baby shower or wedding registry where there's actually something life changing to celebrate."
AskReddit,fnbo84n,t3_g0lbyt,1586819088.0,Stable. Stress free. I've never seen my parents fight or argue. They are literal couple goals in my eyes. Was never mistreated by them in any type of way and they did a damn good job raising us 5 kids.
BPD,fnad661,t3_g0jg6x,1586795423.0," Actually I'm super hung over right now and the exact same feeling. The first time this happened I was so tripped out. Now I'm used to this kind of dissociative hangover. When I drink I know I won't feel normal for at least the next 24 hours. So today I'm just a soulless zombie floating through space, which is super annoying."
AskReddit,fna6td7,t3_g0j6pq,1586792122.0,Messy bun and getting stuff done
BorderlinePDisorder,fn8cu1n,t3_g087rz,1586738811.0,"Definitely. I think this happens to males and is shrugged off because ""guys must always want sex."" And in my opinion, the definition of sexual assault may very from person to person. If you felt it was, then it was."
Stims,fn86kv2,t1_fn863xt,1586734992.0,"You need to distract yourself. Focusing on your heart rate while high is only going to make it feel like it's faster. I used to start feeling like this and the only thing that would calm it was to stop thinking. Engulf yourself in an activity. Video game, music, coloring etc. Trust me, you will be ok! I literally have had such bad panic attacks I was nearly passing out. Seeing black spots I worked myself up so bad. Just relax amd you'll mellow out. Easier said than done I know."
Stims,fn863mp,t1_fn85zgu,1586734699.0,I recall many nights of being so high I thought I was stroking out...lol. funny looking back but it's terrifying while it happens.
Stims,fn85zgu,t3_g00wpc,1586734628.0,Panic attack. After years of use this started happening to me nearly every time I got high. It even happens to me if I smoke weed now days. It's all a mind game.
BPD,fn7dnqd,t1_fn6w7vj,1586718271.0,"That is the perfect word! ""Dream girling"". I have done this so many times. Picking up on the kind of woman and relationship the guy is looking for, then literally becoming it for them. At least on the outside. More so putting on a big elaborate show to appear perfect I'm their eyes. Slowly letting my pan true colors show until they realize I'm a bit nuts. Then I run off and find someone else to ""dream girl"""
BPD,fn7d3wo,t3_fzwrh9,1586717964.0,Yes. And generally I know I have no intention of loving them back. I've come a long way from acting this way through therapy and some soul searching though. I still crave to be desired but I don't act on it to avoid hurting others.
BorderlinePDisorder,fn558ti,t3_fz0wos,1586656232.0,Absolutely. When I was single If a man didn't try to have sex on the first date I would be so offended.
StopSpeeding,fn52v8k,t3_fzlgcr,1586654615.0,"Come down / withdrawal from my experience - 
body aches. Every muscle will feel sore and it may last a few days or a little more. Depressed feelings and mood swings. Don't be surprised if you find yourself unusually irritable. Although you think you have been sleeping enough, your body still doesn't get the rest it needs while you are using. So be prepared to feel consistently tired for days straight. It does get better but will take your body some time to start having normal energy. When I first would get clean each time I remember that nothing felt enjoyable. My favorite TV shows, hobbies, music etc. All was so bland. I think our brains have to re learn how to enjoy things without the euphoria of meth."
