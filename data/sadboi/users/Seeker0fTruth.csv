>We hit our stride for the fourth task for The Forge Guild.  Briar hit a nat 20 on the history check on sword-making knowledge, Elty did well on his Arcana check to heat the forge with pretidigitation (and had the bright idea to quench it in fresh water-rather than the provided salt water-using his endless decanter). Sam crushed his athletics and acrobatics rolls to hit the sword good and finally, Briar Nat 20ed his dex check to quench the blade in one movement; the result was a fantastic +1 magical long sword that leaves behind petrichor (the smell from after it rains) when you swing it.  We dubbed it Air Freshener.

Sam, our paladin, has been using the sword since.

We had session 21 on Sunday. The BBEG had blasted off his obelisk, which was floating away to invade a nearby island chain. We flew after the obelisk in our air ship. Our warlock (Briar, who made the acrobatics check) cast Major Image over the ship - clear, empty air, no one around, nothing to look at here . . . We were basically cloaked.

""The mirror image only lasts ten minutes, so we had to get close enough to use it and give us a minute to sneak into the hanger and park without being exposed.  We get there, and then realize that the hanger has been boarded up, with the dragon riders circling closely around the tower.

The DM wondered aloud if the dragons can smell us, but Sam draws and waves around his sword Air Freshener and he laughed and let it go.""

I just love that a minor magical item we made eighteen sessions ago called Air Freshener saved us! Those dragon riders are no joke!"

dndnext,fk8x3qi,t3_fgf8zj,1583964526.0,"The party is from [insert good country] and we were shipwrecked by a Kraken in Magical North Korea, run by an evil extra-planar being called The Masked Emperor.

Our Warlock's patron is Asmodeus (shh, don't tell anyone) and we've learned that there's something going on between Him and the sea monsters of the world - it was implied that our Warlock's presence lured the Kraken to sink our ship. We all started with a Rare Item of our choice - I saved mine, but everyone else's went overboard in the shipwreck.

We're level 7 now, and the confrontation with the Masked Emperor is fast approachcing. We decided we were skilled enough to dive for the treasure we knew was down there, figuring we were strong enough to get away even if we lured the kraken

My wizard is a noble bladesinger, who was trained that evocation spells are ""vulgar, darling, for the common classes, not suitable for. . .  Well, our type"". He found a fireball scroll (and reluctantly copied it in his spellbook) but doesn't like using it. And honestly, who brings fireball to a fight with a sea monster? Instead I packed Puppet (a level 1 STR save spell that makes the target drop what it's holding), blindness (con save), and Hypnotic Pattern, while my main damage cantrip is Toll the Dead. (Both wisdom saves).

We spent . . . An hour, at least, of IRL time, deciding how to do the dive. We have a beautiful airship, but we purchased an old, run-down ship (hoping to use it against the emperor) to do our salvage operation in and hired a professional sailor / treasure Hunter named Rick (I can smell gold, I can!). Our paladin used Detect Objects to find the wreck, and then we spent another hour deciding how we wanted to dive - we eventually settled on using our Warlock's major image to disguise our group as open water as we descended.

We were on tenterhooks the entire time. We found our paladin's and warlocks chests - there were two more, but they were just gold. Our water breathing potions were about to run out so we returned to the surface . . . To see Rick transforming into the kraken!

Combat was joined, and let me tell you, my wizard has never felt more useless. The kraken had +15 (at least!) To str, con, and Wis saves - so my spells just bounced off of him like nothing. Meanwhile, the kraken's Dex save was terrible, and because the warlock positioned his fireball between two tentacles, the DM gave him double damage. The kraken had a +15 or something to attack, so even my ludicrous AC (19 in bladesong, 24 with shield) meant nothing as the tentacles kept grabbing me, even as I misty stepped to escape. It was more like a force of nature than a monster.

I was the only one to drop in the fight (shame!) Although I was brought up by our lovely healing Lore Bard in time to cast Polymorph (my first time! What a rush!) on our ranger, turning him into a giant shark to secure the final blow."

But I definitely feel that with the right party, if it's handled the right way, there's a fun campaign in here somewhere that I'd love to run, and I'd love your input about how to handle it.

It's not ALL fake, is the thing, and I think that most of the meaning remains. Characters that went adventuring to help their sick mothers, or to get one up on their rival in the thieves guild, or to locate a magical artifact that they read about . . . All of those motivations are still real. Mom is real and is still sick, the thieves guild members are still under bad leadership, the magical artifact hidden in a dungeon is still there, albeit the dungeon was made by engineers and not A Lich Moste Ancients ande Terrible. 

The exception to this, I think, is if we had a truly devout character. The gods, of course, would be a manifestation of the same macguffin that makes barbarians able to survive nuclear bombs and wizards able to stop time.  ""God doesn't exist"" would be quite a blow, on top of everything else. However, with my group of players, I don't think that's an issue - I've never seen a less religiously inclined bunch of players.

And if the characters expressed the same irritation about their world being invaded by tourists - totally reasonable - running a campaign where they are freedom fighters trying to liberate their world from the off-worlders . . . Well that sounds like fun, doesn't it?

loremasters,fj1f3q3,t3_fanh2r,1582918753.0,"My favorite piece of Lore I've ever seen was Brennan Lee Mulligan's Gharty O'Brian from Dimension 20 live.

Gharty explained that Gods (like, say, Pelor) have angels in their pantheon and also have devils. Those devils don't exist in service to a greater fiend, they just exist to oppose Pelor. Similarly, there are hosts of angels that exist only to oppose the evil gods that exist

Gharty is a Orcish Aasimar; they come from a lineage of angels that oppose Gruumsh. While Gruumsh lures Orcs into evil by inflaming their bloodlust, Gharty (and the others in this portion of the pantheon) seduce people into doing good, via sensual pleasures, etc.

That's definitely the axis that I would play with; look at the ways the devils / fallen angels oppose the god of their pantheon. Since Pelor (for example) is a God of agriculturez health and light, I'd play up features of famine, darkness and  disease. Make poisons or disease that bypass immunities, emphasize enemies that try and weaken their opponents rather than just being strong themselves, etc. 

I hope that helps!

dndnext,fj19l94,t1_fj14onr,1582915482.0,"Level 6 bladesinger here, almost level 7. 

Not really - you're a wizard to cast big spells, and if you take something with a higher hit die (like a fighter) you don't get the big spells. One solution to patch that over is to take the ""tough"" feat (+2 hp every level) or "" resilient (con)"" for a +1 bonus to con and proficiency in con saves, or both.

At levels 2-4, you and the fighter / paladin are pretty equivalent - you're probably doing about as much damage as them through stabby-stab with your rapier and flaming sphere, your AC is solid while in bladesong and your ability to cast shield means that you're almost never taking hits.

But as you get to higher levels beyond that, you're going to start noticing the trade-offs you made to get your full wizard powers - your lower hit die starts to catch up with you, the enemies are going to start making you roll Dex / con saves (which your Shield doesn't protect you from), and on top of that your spells (especially your concentration spells) are getting better, further disencentivising from entering toe-to-toe combat where things are so dangerous."

dndnext,fgk8usb,t3_eyrd3a,1580859999.0,"Hi everyone,

My character is a level 6 High Elf Bladesinger Wizard. He's a detective - part of the Investigatory Unit (although, to be honest, quite a junior part . . .) who tracks down evil wizards and other arcane threats and eliminates them.

In session three (back in October), my character was nearly killed (soley DM Fiat preventing it) because a high level wizard lost his temper with me over a carnival game.

For literally months I've fantasized about finding that wizard, counterspelling his shitty spells and then cutting him to pieces with my sword (and a little help from my friends).

The party was shipwrecked on a country that we learn (gasp!) is preparing for war against our country!

Four levels on (we're newly level 6), our Warlock's creepy cultist friends tipped us off that they had found a secret passage leading from the sewers, and it looked like it traveled right underneath The Obelisk Of The Masked Emperor (BBEG Lair).

We decide to check it out. 

The most nefarious thing that BBEG guy does is an enormous mind control spell cast over the entire city and nearby countryside. Every time we entered the field in the past, we had to roll a wisdom saving throw. No one, in the history of the campaign, had failed one of those saves - it was a pretty low dc.

This morning though (even with our newly minted Oath Of The Watchers paladin giving us advantage on the Wis save), three people failed and I cast Dispel Magic on our Warlock so he could DM the other two.

We enter this secret passage, we find a sort of bone pit with an evil, Edward scissorhands demon, who grapples our paladin and teleports away. Shit, where is he? Hey fighter, have a Fly, go look! (This plan worked great and the paladin was fine).

Then we fought some mummy knights on demon horses that needed a good taste of Hypnotic Pattern and, during the short rest, I used Arcane recovery to gain back a level 3 spells slot, only to immediately use it when we triggered a magical wall-crushing trap.

Some of you at home are counting and realizing that I've made a critical error.

We finally confront the wizard and I have . . . No counterspells

We charge in, I get a good hit with my sword . . . And then I got grappled by zombie arms,  the wizard cast Time Stop, makes a wall of force, and then blasts us with Come of Cold, knocking me down .  The bard revives me with mass healing word, and then I'm immediately knocked down, the ranger brings me back, I'm knocked down again . . . And then he dies, buried beneath Eldritch blasts, arrows and longsword swings.

All told I got two hits in with my sword (out of four attacks) and I cast puppet, which he resisted. Not exactly the heroic spellcaster on spellcaster battle I had been imagining. It was so anticlimactic that it was several hours before I realized hey! We killed a wizard! He was an evil wizard! Who could cast level 9 spells!

I did the thing! My character (helped) kill the evil, high level wizard! I'm going to be a huge bigshot when I return to the office! And I have a spellbook with (at least!) Cone of Cold, Wall of Force, Globe of Invulnerability, and Time Stop! (Afterwards the DM gave me the prepared spell list: I also have Fire Shield, Banishment, Teleport, and Stone Skin in there).

I feel on top of the world about it, even if I didn't so that much in the fight itself!

I spoke to the DM afterwards - not the Wizard that tried to kill me over a carnival game. The hunt continues!"

My fiancee is a monk (who only occasionally plays with the group). Last game we played with her, this ghost druid guy blinded her and then began using Sunbeam on everyone.

While blinded, she hit him four times in a row and he *gasp* failed one of the four con checks she forced on him.

Total badass."

dndnext,fggi3gk,t1_fgg9xef,1580762330.0,Sent a DM; they're all written down if you want to read them.
dndnext,fgg9b9b,t1_fgg4ief,1580757026.0,"So . . . Disclaimer, I started with a Sunblade, which colors my feelings on things, because +8 to hit for 1d8+5 damage feels SO much better than +6 to hit for 1d8+3. 

So, that out of the way, it feels awesome.  I have a 19 ac wearing studded leather in bladesong. Watching the DM try to hit me is hilarious. 17 to hit? 18 to hit? 16 to hit? *His eyes light up* 23 to hit? ""I shield"". It's priceless.

And I do very respectable damage without casting a real spell, 2d8+10 with two attacks, 3d8+9 total (I think) with green flame blade, if they're packed together in the way GFB likes. This lets me take more cool detective spells and fewer things like mage armor and Scorching Ray.

That being said, I'm obviously playing with fire a bit. I'm level six and I'm putting myself in just as much danger as the paladin and the fighter, and they have twice as many hit points. I'm incredibly vulnerable to con saves (+1) or crits (which no amount of AC can save you from). The Mummy Knights fight was the second between short rests; one of those horses crit me and I was knocked unconscious and stood up with two hit points and no bladesongs - 40 damage (not common at my level but not unheard of) would have sent me straight to Mt. Celestial. In the wizard fight, I got hilariously close to being turned into a frozen statue. My health max is 37, I got mass healing worded twice and healing worded once, and cone of Cold was bring thrown around for 40-45 damage.

So . . . Fun, reasonable damage, high utility, survivability is a little suspect . . ."
dndnext,fgfte2v,t1_fgfpzmp,1580747190.0,"Exactly! *Spits*

I checked with the DM - Lesterak was not the asshole who shot me out of the air when I was level 2.
