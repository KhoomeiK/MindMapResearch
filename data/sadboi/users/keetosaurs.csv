(Not to mess with something so well-said...”weapons of reason” are important, but - since there are many things we can’t reason our way through - I’d add weapons of perseverance, acceptance, and realism that allows for hope, and - as long as you’re doing what you need to do - weapons of seeking delight, distraction, and release to this idea.

It is really hard to decide what personal objects to keep from someone else’s life (since we usually already have plenty of our own sentimental and practical things, it would be overwhelming to hang onto many of another person’s), and it’s very kind of you to donate all that stuff to help others. 

I was pretty vague in my first post, but what I find sad about secondhand stores isn’t that families have given away those items, but the idea that the people that treasured those things (like the Best Grandma mugs and the photos) are probably gone. Next time I go to a thrift shop, I’ll try to keep your story of your MIL’s first husband in mind, to remember that - even if it wasn’t a long life - that many of these people had full lives and that (hopefully) when and how they ended was only a very small part of their stories, and - instead of seeing their personal objects as representing mortality or loss - to think of the pleasure and use they got from these things in life.

PsychologicalTricks,fcx8rms,t3_ej0ldy,1578055690.0,"There are lots of good ideas on this thread. I procrastinate as well, so sometimes - when something can’t wait - I force myself to stop all the fun distractions and just start doing the task. If you dread it as I do, try breaking the task down into small, concrete steps. (If your mind wanders, it’ll help to keep a numbered list and check off each step as you do it.) Have a small reward waiting for you (some Netflix time, a snack) after you finish each task or step, and don’t indulge unless/until you do that step. (Having something to look forward at each step along the way can be your short term rewards.) 

If you’re still having a hard time focusing after trying a lot of the suggestions on this thread, you may want to consider getting tested for attention-deficit disorder. (My brother had a really hard time in high school and avoided his homework, but getting diagnosed with ADD and taking his meds turned things around for him quickly.) I don’t mean to sound presumptuous, but a couple of other things that might be affecting your ability to focus are anxiety and depression, both of which can cause brain fog, lack of motivation, fatigue, and a feeling of helplessness (if you don’t feel hopeful about your future, then working on long-term goals might feel pointless), so - if any of this sounds like you - you may want to talk to your parents or another trusted adult about this. 

Good luck! 🙂"
Jewdank,fcx6pf1,t1_fcw1qza,1578053478.0,"I think they’re referring to the food restrictions of observant Jews and Muslims, but - as others have mentioned on this post - some Christians and people of other religions have their own restrictions (iirc, Catholics - at least in the past - weren’t supposed to eat red meat on Fridays.) 

(If it makes you feel better, as in many religions, there are Jews who observe all the traditional laws and “lox and bagels” Jews who may be secular religiously but identify as Jews culturally, and a wide range in between, and I doubt that every Jewish person here gets all of the jokes on this and similar subreddits (at least, a lot of times I don’t, and I feel a twinge of not being in on the joke), so please don’t take it as a slight. Not completely on topic, but there’s a famous saying that if you have two Jews, you have three opinions.)

I can’t speak for anyone else, but I really appreciate it when people who are not Jewish are interested in Jewish culture and experiences, especially nowadays, so I hope you (or anyone else here) don’t feel left out, and that you feel free to ask questions - hopefully respectful and genuine questions will be responded to in kind. 🙂"

parrots,fcx47zg,t3_ecl9q1,1578050511.0,"This isn’t really a tip, but...I have a pair of budgies, too - mine are 7-years-old. While they will often jump onto my hand while they are outside of their cage - or from a portable perch that we hang on their open cage door - they don’t like hands inside their cage while they’re inside. (Often they’ll shrink away from my hands and into a corner of the cage or they’ll fly out if I “invade.”) 

The poster who mentioned food had a good idea. Sometimes I’ll hold a small millet spray in my cupped hands, and my guys will come over to nibble it, probably since fingers are warmer and softer than the perches they usually sit on. 

Lots of times when you have a pair of birds they bond with each other and just tolerate their humans, so the fact that you’ve been able to get them to interact with you so much is really great! My boys bonded with me mostly because one is really extroverted, so the other was influenced to be as well. Still, after seven years, they do not like to sit on my shoulders, only on my hands or lower arms, and - though they mostly trust us - they will still get nervous and fly away quickly at times, usually when they see or hear something unexpected, such as a bird flying by outside the window or a sneeze. (I think it’s just the nature of them being small, vulnerable animals and having to be vigilant.) 

I’m not sure if I missed this, but do your guys have other places they’re allowed to perch besides their cage? Mine fly, and we have a small playground that they like to perch on, and - since they sometimes fly to the back of the sofa and onto a lampshade (with the light off to be safe) - we’ll drape a small piece of fabric on these things just in case. If your birds have other places they’re comfortable/used to besides the cage, you might be able to ease them away from their cage more easily. (Still, my birds are not relaxed unless they can easily see their cage and know they can “go home” whenever they want.)

(Btw, I don’t mean to sound like a worrywart, but - if you haven’t yet - you might want to Google pet birds and danger; unfortunately there are a lot of surprising things (plants, chemical fumes, drafts, some non-stick pans, chocolate, avocados, etc.) that can hurt our guys.) 

Hopefully people with more tips will see your post and answer soon. Enjoy your sweeties and good luck with your training! 🌞"
NatureIsFuckingLit,fcx1lbx,t1_fcvvp7b,1578047155.0,"I have two parakeets, and there are certain types of noises and gestures (a kind of jutting their heads forward and down, as if they’re threatening to jab with their beaks) they make only when they’re being bothered (by humans or each other.) I don’t know if they can actually formulate the idea that they are angry (or doting, nervous, grieving, or happy), but they often behave in ways that make it seem that they feel some sort of emotion. 

(For instance, I had one pair of parakeets that were together from babyhood until one of them died when they were both 8 years old. Both birds would talk to each other and to us (especially when they wanted treats), but - when his friend died suddenly - our other bird called for him for a full day, and - after that - he pretty much stopped talking or calling for the few months that he survived his friend, and - though he’d previously loved food - he hardly wanted to eat anymore. I don’t know what was going on in his mind, but he acted like people do when they are grieving, so - even if it’s all based on instinct or biology and not “thought out” in the way most humans experience emotion - I believe birds do have feelings.

(For those who aren’t in a place to commit to reading a whole book right now, this book is divided into mostly self-contained (iirc) chapters on various topics, such as Poverty, Populations, History, etc., so it’s easy to browse or go straight to the topics that you’re interested in.)"

cancer,fcqeug4,t3_ehcubt,1577884605.0,"This is rambling - I have a hard time knowing what to leave out - so please don’t feel obliged to read it. (It was helpful for me just to put this into words.)

Hello, I (44f) got diagnosed with Stage 1 Breast Cancer in November and had a lumpectomy/sentinel node biopsy last month, and radiation and/or chemo followed by hormone therapy within the next few months. I’m having similar feelings to yours. Lots of awfully-inappropriate jokes and puns with my mom and stepdad, but - once everyone else is asleep - I sometimes cry. (I don’t know if you or others have this issue, but I feel like my parents are having a worse time of this so far than I have (especially because they both lost close relatives to cancer at young ages) and they already worry about me because I’ve had depression and anxiety for most of my life, so - even though they are both very loving and supportive - I don’t want to them to know that this is really shaking me. I hope to be seeing a new therapist soon, because - as others here have said - you can be free to discuss things that would scare or upset your loved ones, and it has really helped me in the past.)

Learning other people’s stories makes me feel connected and not alone in this, but reading what so many here are going through makes me feel “lucky” in comparison, and I feel like a fraud and find myself starting to suppress my own bad feelings because what I’m going through is “easy” compared to other people here, and I feel guilty that other people have things so much worse. (Intellectually, I know that it’s totally reasonable and understandable to want to scream at the top of our lungs with any cancer diagnosis, and that it’s important to allow myself to feel whatever I feel and not push it down, but the unhelpful inner voices are hard to ignore.) 

The way you’re trying to stay in the moment and not go into “What-If Land” is pretty positive...I try to learn about my treatment options, side effects, etc., because learning and planning are some of my usual coping skills, but - in this case - the more I read, the more uncertain and less in control of everything I feel, and I start catastrophizing (aka What-If Land.) Lately, I’ve been reading a lot less about cancer on my own, but I’ll write down lists of questions before I meet with my doctors and take notes while I’m there. (I guess this is my version of going with the flow, though part of me is afraid that I am going to miss out on important, life-changing information if I don’t research obsessively.)

Some of the ways I’m trying to cope are: animals (spending time with my birds or even looking at other people’s cute pet pics here on Reddit); jokes/puns/word games; watching engrossing TV/movies (my brain feels more scattered than usual, so it makes it harder to read); listening to music; talking or laughing with others (even if it’s online); singing when alone - for people who aren’t criers, singing, yelling, and laughing (and exercise, whatever that is) can all give a great feeling of release.

By the way, I don’t know if there’s already an everything-allowed humor thread in this sub (it could easily be too hurtful for many people, if they stumble onto it unaware, so maybe it’s inappropriate), but - hearing that you and others here also use dark humor to cope - maybe a thread would be helpful? (I laughed at your “tada” to your mom. My stepdad was taking his car into the body-shop, so we joked about how he could drop me off there, too.)

I hope you (and everyone here, and your/their friends and family) are coping as well as you can, and that things get better for you. 🌞"
cancer,fcq07e3,t3_ec0lw9,1577875942.0,"Hello, I don’t know much about the statistics, but it does sound like you and your family have been struck extra hard. Why some people get cancer and others don’t seems unpredictable. (For instance, I was recently diagnosed with Stage 1 Breast Cancer, and - because I’m in my mid-40s and my mother’s family has had a lot of cancer (including cancer at young ages) - my mom and I were tested for 84 of the gene mutations known to make cancer more likely; I tested positive for a gene mutation, but my mom tested negative, which means that my mutation came from my dad’s family. His parents lived into their 80s and 90s, his brother is in his 70s, and he died suddenly at 54, and none of them had cancer as far as I know.) TL;DR: Sometimes genetics testing has really surprising results when it comes to cancer-predisposing mutations.  

I don’t know if this is the same situation with different cancers, but my gene mutation wasn’t known to cause cancer until 1999 - and my particular variation even less time than that - so a lot of discoveries are still being made in that area. Also, iirc, genetic testing became a lot cheaper during the last decade, so - as more cancer patients are tested for a greater variety of mutations and patients with these mutations are tracked for years - geneticists should be able to make more connections than they have so far. (Sorry if this is rambling; also, please take this all with a grain of salt, as this is based on my single case and what I’ve read recently and learned from a genetics counselor.)

I’m very sorry about what you and your family have gone through/are going through, and I hope this year (and beyond) that things get better for you in any way they can."
awakened,fcplx3s,t1_fcok1ve,1577867174.0,"Thanks! I don’t know anything about birthcharts, but - if you end up doing it - I hope it is helpful to you, and that your year (and beyond) turns out great!

(Our younger selves were annoying in their own ways (at least mine was), so we can ignore those pipsqueaks and their eye-rolling about how we turned out. 😁)"
DAE,fcmxlu8,t1_fcmusu7,1577796705.0,"Yes, that feeling of ownership/keeping  a treasure is what I like as well."
DAE,fcmwzrc,t3_eh87rz,1577796019.0,"Hello, I don’t have any tips for you, but  the people at r/decidingtobebetter might."
DAE,fcmwan9,t3_ehl5a8,1577795192.0,"I agree. Sometimes I’ll browse those subs, and some of the people put on a nonchalant/cool air, but they seem pretty vulnerable underneath, and - if they’re lonely and/or desperate for approval - one nasty comment could do a lot of damage. (A nice thing I’ve noticed, though, is that even on some of the harshest subs there are people who make it a point to be kind, and - if they offer criticism - it’s done gently and constructively.)"
DAE,fcmv2ur,t3_ehdog8,1577793655.0,"Me too. If it’s somewhere I haven’t spent money in before, I’ll usually do the tip or buy-something-cheap thing (bathroom tax) others have mentioned. 

(On the flip-side, once I was browsing in a small bookstore in NYC for a couple of hours, and - even though I was buying some books - the clerk still wouldn’t allow me to use the restroom, and I was desperate at that point. When I visited London, it was really nice to find public restrooms that were pretty clean; I don’t know if they are always like that, but it was a pleasant surprise.)"
DAE,fcmt9de,t3_ehpmqr,1577791165.0,"It’s great that you can do this! I have to remind myself to look for those little pleasures when I’m stressed, and they only buoy me for short amounts of time, but it’s encouraging to know that it’s possible to sustain your good mood for much longer. Maybe it’s a cycle: you feel happy physically, which reminds you mentally/emotionally that you’re happy, and the thought that you’re happy leads you to feel physically uplifted, and it all keeps going around?"
DAE,fcmrzbi,t3_ehvyr6,1577789342.0,"Are you asking because you do? I prefer physical media (such as compact discs and books and magazines) because it feels more permanent and graspable/tactile to me. Digital feels like smoke floating in the air imo, because I need to rely on a fragile device that quickly becomes obsolete and wifi that is unreliable. I love that a paper book still “works” if you drop it or get it wet, and you never need to charge it. Even if all electricity somehow disappeared, books would still be usable. (The ability to read/listen/watch/stream so much content  whenever we want through devices still feels pretty magical to me, however...)"
DAE,fcmrbc6,t3_ehwxek,1577788373.0,"When I was younger, my default inner voice used to be the “negative self critic” type, but I’ve learned to install/download and encourage that logical (or more understanding and realistic) voice with time and therapy. 

(The self-critical voice can be helpful at times to let us know when we’ve done something we shouldn’t, or to be honest with ourselves, as long as it’s constructive and doesn’t tear us down. I’m - and/or my positive voice is - still trying to get my self-critical voice to be gentler and more reasonable...😇😬👿)

You’re right - our minds are very interesting (and sometimes confusing) places!"
DAE,fcmqfxo,t3_ehwz9d,1577787124.0,"I usually do, too. Mostly I’m afraid of accidentally hurting someone else, both for their sake and because I don’t know if I could live with the guilt. (I have Harm OCD, so I worry about this stuff a lot more than is “normal.”) However, if it’s late at night, no one else is on the road, and I know exactly where I’m going, I often enjoy driving while listening to music. 

If you have to drive, maybe listening to music will calm you a little? Sometimes singing along can help, too, if you’re not worried what other drivers will think of you. Also, when I’m driving somewhere unfamiliar (on non-highway roads) I’ll drive slower than usual to feel comfortable, pulling over onto the road shoulders with emergency blinkers regularly to allow people to pass me, if there are no passing lanes. 
 
If you have to go somewhere you’re not comfortable driving to only once every so often, and you don’t have a ride, it might be worth the money to get an Uber or Lyft. 

Hopefully our nervousness doesn’t cause us to panic, but helps us to drive more carefully and not take safety for granted - fingers crossed. Best wishes on your driving and calming your anxiety! 🌞"
DAE,fcmodbu,t3_ehulvm,1577784180.0,"Me too. I’ve hoarded a ton of them over many years, but I haven’t been reading much in the last few years (too distracted by Reddit, phone games, etc.) Having so many books sitting unread makes me feel a little guilty, so I’ve been trying to be more selective about how many I buy, and to give away ones that I can’t ever realistically see myself reading.

I don’t know about you guys, but - as long as I don’t have to move them all - it’s nice to have all these “goodies” around me. (Plus, full bookshelves against walls help to muffle noise coming from other rooms, which is a great added benefit!)"

awakened,fck340v,t3_ehgu86,1577715152.0,"

Hello, I read later in the thread that your family and your ex were abusive...this might be completely irrelevant, but - if that feeling of brokenness means you feel a lot of shame - the terms “toxic shame” and CPTSD (C for complex and/or ongoing trauma, including abuse) may fit some of how you feel.)

I have a lot of the same feelings you’ve mentioned, and therapy (especially cognitive behavioral therapy, which teaches you how to reframe your thoughts and not to accept every thought that pops into your head as “truth” - similar to techniques others have mentioned in this thread) and medication have helped me deal with my issues - they’re still there deep down, but they’re a lot more tolerable now and my self-talk/thoughts of myself are far more kind and forgiving than they used to be. I hope you’re able to find a way to heal from your pain. :)"
AVoid5,fcjuoos,t3_efj4n0,1577705629.0,This is both horrifying and fascinating to look at. If you can post that sub’s alias (with stars or similar symbols to avoid fifth-glyphs) - so that I can vicariously know our opposition’s way of living - I would thank you happily!
