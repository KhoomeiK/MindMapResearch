abuse,fqbe9aj,t3_ghwpoi,1589235378.0,"He sounds A LOT like my abusive ex. Especially the it’s always someone else’s fault, especially woman he was with at some point. And you made me think about it but nope, he never talked about women unless it was how they looked, something sexual or to talk shit. Glad you got out the relationship now time to drop all contact. Wish you the best ❤️"
abuse,fkwacjq,t3_fl1smc,1584587231.0,"Took me three years to leave my abusive ex boyfriend and I feel the same, freedom. It’s a great feeling, especially when for so long leaving them seems like the worst thing but in the end it is the BEST. 
Happy for you, sending the best wishes ❤️
We will find love again. :)"

GabrielFernandez,fjp0n2b,t1_fjoitse,1583538970.0,"Social workers saw, not police or medical professionals but yeah I get your point"
GabrielFernandez,fjoiol3,t1_fjof684,1583528526.0,"A drunk parent has tried to pick a student up from my classroom, I wouldn’t let her go and kept her. So I’m sure if I explained my reasoning and they actually investigated and saw the bruises it wouldn’t be a problem."
abuse,fjds294,t3_fcvwlh,1583258143.0,"I got into that same head space and some days are still hard but I’ve been out 1 and a half months and every day gets brighter. Get out. It’ll get easier with time, I hope like me you’ll just feel grateful you’re alive and that you were strong enough to leave. You got this."
abusiverelationships,fjbu20u,t3_fcmgsv,1583201420.0,"You didn’t allow yourself to get stuck in this situation. 
  
Also remember looks can be deceiving. He used to tell me his ex before me was awful and all this stuff (now he says same bout me and now I know first hand it was prob him not her) but for her, I was the one posting great pics looking like he changed and everything was good, but he hadn’t, and it wasn’t. Maybe for a sec but unless a narcissist or someone with bpd like I think my ex has gets help they will never change. 

Even if he has changed it doesn’t change what he did to you. That’s what it came down to for me. He was doing same old shit but saying “I’m trying, I’m gonna change, I’m getting help”. I gave this time and nothing changed for longer than 2 weeks. But even when I stayed I felt awful like I just knew it would all be bad again soon and even if it wasn’t I couldn’t pretend what he did to me didn’t happen. 

Even if he is good to her now, he wasn’t to you and that’s not your fault. I promise, from experience I know you’re better off."
GabrielFernandez,fjadm7j,t1_fj9m1y6,1583171338.0,"Seriously 
I’m kidnapping the child and calling from my house if I have to. I understand “following protocol” but what about following your morals, your heart, your brain for god sake, she and all the others just failed miserably so many different ways his life could’ve been saved."
GabrielFernandez,fj9lsnq,t1_fj9c6jq,1583153052.0,"I just don’t understand how medical professionals, police officers, firefighters all say they’ve never seen a child in that condition but this child went to school that way!"
GabrielFernandez,fj9kab9,t1_fj9c6jq,1583151630.0,"Yeah, I stopped at episode 3. Don’t think I can finish. She says she feels regret but it didn’t really seem like it."
GabrielFernandez,fj8l4r4,t1_fj8l145,1583115944.0,"True! 
There were just so many other options than she made it seem like"
GabrielFernandez,fj8gqgk,t1_fj8b6m8,1583113011.0,"The protocol they teach us is really exactly what she did, you call and report. Honestly, it kinda stops there, they don’t say much on what to do if the social worker doesn’t do anything. 

She called this woman what 4 times? 
After she did nothing the first time, excuse my French but fuck protocol. Calling 911 and he’s not leaving my classroom."
GabrielFernandez,fj80bed,t1_fj809ut,1583102258.0,EXACTLY
GabrielFernandez,fj7ag0p,t1_fj775l8,1583088798.0,"I work at a private school so it’s slightly different. The owner of the school is in the office almost everyday and I know for a fact she would agree with me to not let that child go home and she’d handle whatever consequences. I have about 3 other people over me that are below her and I know they’d feel the same way as well. We always talk about how we are advocates for every student and I’m lucky I’m at a place where I can see all the teachers are on the same page. 

There’s just no way a child would say what Gabriel said  to a teacher and come in looking how he did and just keep going back to that house. We teach our students to always come to an adult, so sad he did just that multiple times and was failed 😢

As for protocol we are taught exactly what she did. We’ve watch countless videos that look almost identical to what she did. Call, report. When no one is helping sometimes you break protocol. The day she said he was crying saying he didn’t want to go home, I know for a fact I would call the police and keep that child in my classroom as long as needed. That’s of course no where in the “protocol” but could’ve saved Gabriel’s life."
GabrielFernandez,fj73exj,t3_farydz,1583085651.0,"I am a teacher and there is NO possible way I would see a child like that more than once and just let him go home NO WAY. I know people say “you don’t know until you’re in the situation” but no, I know.

It would never have gotten to the point where he got shot with a BB gun if I were the teacher but if it had. I am calling the police and this child is not leaving my classroom. Drag me if you have to. I’m locking us both in there until police come. Something, I know she said she felt stuck but there were other options."
abusiverelationships,firwk9h,t3_f8szbg,1582672538.0,"I know you’ve heard it before, but you’re 19 you’re life is far from over though I know it feels like it. I’m 24 and it was very hard for me to leave at first because I felt I was too old, or would never find anyone else. 
You left! That means you’re strong 
It’s been a month for me and he contacts me like every weekend which sends me back to day one 
If I ignore or block he threatens to get evicted from the apartment that is still half in my name. 
YOU WILL get through this. I know it. Message me any time."
abusiverelationships,fipavrt,t3_f92ts4,1582602048.0,"Hello, I just want to say thank you for sharing that. It’s so crazy how so much of what I read on here sounds so much like my own experience when at one point it felt like no one else could understand. I’ve been out of my abusive relationship about a month (after leaving and coming back more than once. I’ve had amazing clarity and have felt better in the last month than I had with him for at least a year. 

The issues with sex you spoke of were almost identical to my situation. I haven’t been with anyone else intimately yet and i must say it does scare me. Like most people I enjoy sex, but he took a lot of that from me. So even when I just start thinking about sex because I’m in the mood or what not, he pops into my head, and only the negative sex experiences surface. 

I hope you’ve found the same sense of freedom I’ve found recently because it’s amazing. It’s honestly like 90% of my major stressors vanished so much so that idea of sex isn’t a trigger so much anymore which is great when it seemed to be the cause of so many problems with him. 

Best thing would be to take it slow and be very honest with this new person. I’ve decided I don’t want just casual sex with the next person, I want us to care enough about each other that I can tell them about my trauma and if they choose to leave because of it 
They’re not the ones 

I am sooooo sorry that was so long, I just felt your post so much and wanted to let you know you’re really not alone. Message me any time"
abusiverelationships,fij6soc,t1_fiizl3f,1582436241.0,Thank you so much! I’m so happy you got out too. I’d left before and ended up just coming back. This time felt so liberating because I was and still am 100% certain I’m never going back to that man and it feels soooo gooood
abusiverelationships,fij3uum,t1_fiiw34h,1582434050.0,I was in an abusive relationship and it’s some really scary shit but best thing is to get some kind of protection and that’s what police and lawyers are for (hopefully) I know she’s scared but it’ll be just as bad if she stays.

abusiverelationships,fiijppe,t3_f7yezi,1582422398.0,"I’ve been out of the apartment we shared a little over a month and it’s really been sooo great. I have so much more peace of mind tho he still scares me. 

My last straw was when I called his family for help as he had been yelling at me and forbidding me to leave the apartment for hours. They came over. He was literally holding me down and not letting me go IN FRONT OF THEM. They tried to convince him to leave. He wouldn’t. Annnnd. They just left me there. And whole time were saying things like “what have you let this girl do to your mind?” Like I was reason he was crazy and abusive. I convinced him to stay at his moms for the night by saying “yes, we could work it out I just need a break.” And the moment he left. I packed my shit and got out."
abusiverelationships,fiii2tm,t3_f82ck5,1582421889.0,That is so scary sorry you and her are going through this. Is her family aware?
abusiverelationships,fgnzezj,t3_ezjrba,1580956284.0,I’m only on week two and it still fucking sucks but I will say I’m much better than day one. And 100% better than when I was in that relationship. I wish you the very best because I really feel you.
abusiverelationships,fgluhm1,t1_fglucrx,1580911234.0,Yeah Ive felt that way too. Honestly I felt all kind of ways just in months
abusiverelationships,fglu3l3,t3_ez4vbk,1580910964.0,"Yup, same. I’m out and I yet I still defend him. However, I’ve come to think that I defend him to make ME not look so bad for having dealt with what I dealt with for so long."
abusiverelationships,fgk4ynm,t3_eywiyi,1580857591.0,I made the same decision a little bit ago. Definitely for the best.
abusiverelationships,fgk4tqa,t3_eyyqqt,1580857506.0,I went through same thing! I finally got out almost 2 weeks ago. It’s hard since we shared an apartment and he refuses to let me out the lease. Do you have any money? Could possibly do a cheap Airbnb for a while. No friends who could help??

abusiverelationships,ffqfn4d,t1_ffqfia6,1580133182.0,Thank you. It is all just so much because I don’t want to put that on this persons record but if I’m left with no choice I will. Their own decisions led them here.
abusiverelationships,ffpktas,t3_eu00s5,1580097479.0,"I relate to this sooo much. I just recently got out and the light at the end of the tunnel seems far. However, I feel this sense of relief that I’m at least somewhat out of his control. Remember how strong you are just for walking away! 
They’re so good at making you think it’s all your fault and at least for me that made me stay when I shouldn’t have. At least now remember your freedom that YOU got back ❤️"
abusiverelationships,ffpjw6b,t3_eudkxu,1580096811.0,"In a very similar boat but at the end of the day for me personally I just remember this feeling is far better than the constant anxiety and feeling of entrapment. We’ll both get through it, wish you the best ❤️"

I’ve tried making tops before but was never very proud of them. This is the first piece I felt came out how I wanted it. I had to add a belt tie thing on top because they we little loose toward the back but after that they fit like a glove :) 
Thanks so much again!"

Isn’t a moment I don’t think about it. Can’t eat, can’t sleep. It’s better that alternative though. We will look back and think wow great thing I got out of that."

I can’t help but see the good and make excuses for him like how he’s been through a lot in life and needs help but I know that doesn’t give him the right to treat me how he did. I’m still defending him to my family and friends. I threatened to end things like every week, go stay somewhere else then comeback. This time, I was serious. When he saw all my stuff gone he flipped not on me but in general. I’m still in a lease that I’m trying to get out of (he wont agree to break lease) because he has damaged the apartment before and I don’t want that on me or my credit.

It was bad, cops got called because his music but he flipped out yelling thinking I called them or something.

My boyfriend has BPD, we also argue a lot lately, he’s threatened to kill himself before when I said I couldn’t take it anymore. It just becomes too much to watch someone you love not love themselves (my situation, idk about yours). Currently he is going to try Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Cognitive Behavior Therapy. That’s all I ever wanted, I can help him through it if I SEE the effort. He was in denial for the longest. So I’d say, focus on you, whether that’s therapy, medicine, yoga idk but showing him effort, giving him hope. If the break up happens STILL focus on you because he’ll put the blame on himself if you threaten to do anything (my situation as well)."
