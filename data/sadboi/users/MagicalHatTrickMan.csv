relationships,fmkmm1m,t1_fmkeyvk,1586160310.0,"I can go back to my flat. I currently reside with her family for the entire lockdown. I wanted to live with her since and she also wanted to be with her parents. So I had to adjust. Just a quick update, she STILL wont listen. She tells me to just “bury it” and let things get back to normal. But knowing her, i know shes going to hang on to it for a long time and just let it accumulate until she explodes. I wont lie either, im like that too. However, shes on an extreme level where shes unstable and completely irrational. Ive tried to be soft, ive tried to be firm, ive tried appealing to her emotionally, still doesnt work. I love her, but frankly shes going to kill me in the long run (metaphorically because i still have confidence she wont literally)"
relationships,fmkesrd,t1_fmke3e8,1586152553.0,"I can, theres a place i think i can live in. Right now all shes doing is blocking me and slamming the doors like theres no tomorrow. I could go and talk, but the last time i did that today, she wouldnt even budge, not even look at me, even closed the door at me. It is toxic and im aware. I genuinely love her, but i cant bear trying to “guess whats wrong” and want her to cooperate and actually talk with me"
relationships,fmkemxl,t1_fmkbbo4,1586152406.0,"I have tried to reason with her, she really does refuse to to talk me and continues to say “do i have to spell it out for you?!”. I ask her whats the problem and she refuses to tell me what it is and that i have to “figure it out on my own”. Quite frankly, everytime she does this i love a little bit of me and i more or less have had enough"

selfharm,eyz0y9m,t3_czhq5g,1567606961.0,"I feel the same way...
At some point I see people go above and beyond to ""feel"" the pain. Then i see the cuts ive done over the years and it wont even hold up to theirs. I kinda felt like mine was a lesser form of self harm in a way... This made me think, ""the way im cutting, is it really getting me the pain i wanted, or just a cry for attention?"". To this day, i still have no answer."

depression,eycrc84,t3_cwl19g,1567005849.0,"Im with you on this. Ive lost all hope. If one day some truck runs me over and kills me instantly, I wouldnt mind at all. This life i have is in no means hard, but I have honestly lost my hunger for life. I wish i wanted to live. There are people that i love, people i wanna live with, but i think im too depressed to see the upside of anything. I wish i had a dream, i wish i had a goal for my life, i wish i could find this life worth living for or staying."
