reddeadredemption,fpub68w,t3_gdyv6o,1588908711.0,"I'd like a prequel but not in the direct way of the van der lin gang. 

I know Uncle is know as the ""gang meme"" on reddit about lumbago and everything but just think about it. We don't know a lot about his background, where he come from before the gang and everything. Of course his saying around the camp might be true (I don't really think so but still) and just imagine how badass it could be :

At first, you don't know who your character is. We all think it's a new character in the series because he isnt call ""uncle"". We only learn it at the end who we are playing. We would play throught his whole life, from when he started to be an outlaw until when he joined the van der lin gang. And at the end, uncle doesnt speak about it because he was one of the most wanted outlaw out there and he want to hide his identity. And in the epilogue, we would play as younger Arthur with free roam and everything/everywhere unlock. Thats what I'd like tbh.
