I noticed that it's only limited to human voices, metallic pots and pans, ceramic cups with metal spoons & machine sounds like the TV, modem vibrations. Sometimes I do wish there's a button to stop time and motion just for a moment. 

However it's fine when birds are chirping, when it's raining or there's a thunderstorm (find this super relaxing). I'd wish it never ends."
Anxiety,fpl0w56,t1_fogqygs,1588704418.0,"How are you now? I hope you're fine now. Sorry for such a late reply. I'm very new in Reddit. Your comments reminded me of an interesting article from Thought Catalog - about how anxiety can trick us. 

If you're interested to read it, you can type this in the query (not sure if I can post a URL):

Anxiety,fogqpx4,t3_g7d1d4,1587755887.0,"Are you staying by yourself? You may need to identify what makes you nervous. I become more sensitive to sound (noise), light or heat. Makes me agitated, nervous or upset. Too many people at home makes me anxious too. 

If it’s sound, I usually earplugs; if it’s light, I pull down the curtains; if it’s the heat, wear less or go naked. I’m not joking. And I usually stay isolated in the room. 

Not sure about showering and feeling anxious, a warm bath with a few drops of lavender oil usually will do the trick, makes me super relaxed (but also sleepy). Hope this helps :D"
Entrepreneur,focbsrz,t3_g6mj9h,1587669466.0,Thank you so much for this. Love the details and I'm glad it's not 60 points!
