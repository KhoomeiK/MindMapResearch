EDrecoverymemes,fqx1nbq,t3_glacwh,1589723669.0,"This is a very ""see how you are doing"" topic so I will say what has worked for me.


Counting calories is not a long term solution for me. Cutting out certain foods doesn't work. The only things that have worked is being better at being mindful and putting less on my plate, but even that wasn't as helpful as being mindful. 


I had several months in IOP for depression and anxiety and they really pushed mindfullness, so I definitely got lots of practice in. 


Less on my plate means I look at a dish (made up of several portions) and picture what I would normally take as my own portion. I then subtract 3 to 5 bites from that mental image and then take that portion. Once I got in the habit of taking smaller portions, I do not try to keep up the ""subtract some food"" thing. 


Something that helped my snacking was having an app called See How You Eat. It just has you take pictures of your food throughout the day, with room for 3 meals and 3 snacks (you can add multiple pictures to each designated box, though). No calories, no little pop ups that make comments on your food choices (cough myfitness pal). Just the act of being aware of what I was eating throughout the day helped me make choices that were healthier. It was not a long term solution for me; I kept forgetting to take pictures and would then feel bad about forgetting and then I felt shame, which is not helpful.



Also, congrats on realizing you need to change your habits and step out of a relapse! That is super difficult to do and you should feel proud of that. Definitely talk to your care team about it so you can have people help make a plan to keep you healthy going forward."

Fasting is very tricky, and if you are getting burnt out by normal workouts, it is a sign that maybe the fasting should be either stopped or significantly turned down. Active lifestyles are great (props to you for keeping it up), but they do require more 'fuel in your tank' - you gotta make sure you are eating enough to sustain your workouts + your daily life."

Effort doesn't have to mean noting trends and updating, it can be being aware of people around you whose clothes you admire, knowing what makes you feel best, buying things that work together well, and being able to discern what pieces are well made versus what will wear out. 



I also feel like more people would categorize effortless style as something a richer person would have, which has lots of implications of how we view style. Also, it is easier (imo) to have things last a long time AND look good their entire life when they were high quality in the first place, which usually costs more."
