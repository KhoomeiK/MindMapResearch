Keeping a log of symptoms and keeping them detailed is a good way to review when you are with them and so nothing is left out. The doctor can read it for themself if they want to see a pattern or not. Personally my doc loves me i keepa record of my patterns. Another obvious is professionalism, in which you clearly state your needs in a serious mannor. I like to he very a matter of fact and no bull when talking to my various workers.

As far as overcoming the fear to get out and do what I needed to do, I really do suggest having someone you trust come along for the ride should anything happen and need to get rushed back to the house. Any and all self positive reinforcement helped too. A little bit of healthy pressure to get out helped but not too much were I would flip my lid and psyche myself out of not even getting ready to go outside. Prolly lastly make things easier for the physical transition from home to outside like having a plan of attack for what the exact route will be, have your trusted person pick you up, avoid obvious triggers and limit  anything unexpected at all costs!

I hope this helps. It was definitely not ez and the fear did not go away just for going outside once but BBY steps. One day I'll run my own errands while coping just not anytime soon."
