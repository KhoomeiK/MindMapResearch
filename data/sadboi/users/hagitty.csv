SuicideWatch,fldhlii,t3_fo5mpc,1585064685.0,"I'm afraid to even call the hotlines. I know people who've been hung up on. I know people who had the police called, were forced into a mental health facility for several days, and then got stuck with the bill, when they weren't even about to do anything dangerous. My bf called once and they told him his problem wasn't a big enough deal and they didn't have time to talk to him about it and hung up. 

I get they're volunteers and aren't even paid to pretend to care. Just wish there was a better system for people struggling."
SuicideWatch,fldgajg,t3_fnpjco,1585063942.0,"I'm sure that me and you are in very different situations, but your post describes how I feel exactly. I want to die so badly, but I'm afraid to kill myself. I'm not afraid to die, but I'm afraid of messing up and ending up disabled. I'm afraid of causing trauma to my bf and my mom. I wish I could talk about it with somebody, but I've been that burden on other people so many times. Talking doesn't make it any better, so why continue to be a burden? I also wish I just never existed."
