Teach me about what happens when I want to buy a car, how insurance rates are. Instead of cramming college down everyone's throats, explain not just the pros but also the cons of going to college. Be honest about the debt we'll be in. Educate me on the real world. High school claims to get you ready for the real world, but in reality, they do the exact opposite. I've met some teachers who are truly good people, but I'm still at a loss as for why they would spend their life working for a broken system. And this is coming from a person who's mom is a teacher.
