ApexLore,fg40uai,t3_ewo63g,1580493791.0,"Ok I am thinking the tall and skinny look would balance the ""size"" different in the hit box. Plus the rumor of him having the ability to move at normal speed when crouched would be good. That would make him around the the same size as Wraith. ( just thoughts.)"

causticmains,eruvls1,t3_c4143s,1561298787.0,The one thing I don't see from caustic is remembering to cover your tail in traps and the Windows with bars on them the trap goes right in. Sneak up close to the houses and trap the enemy with in. And don't forget to let your team know when a trap has been triggered from behind.
