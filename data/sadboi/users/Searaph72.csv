The scalp massage may be part of trying to help you relax, especially if you have to have hair in a ponytail all day.

tea,fq4z9ae,t3_ggoask,1589087885.0,"You gotta go with what you prefer and what works for you.

For me, I worked in a couple different places that sold a lot of coffee and love the smell of a fresh brewed pot, but it stops there. I could never get past the taste, go drink a cup I had to add so much milk I might as well drink milk, and then it gives me a crampy belly and a rush to the washroom.
I turned to teas after that. There is so much variety, and I also like them over ice instead of juice in the summer.

Both can have caffeine, and tea gives me more of a longer lasting bit of energy, where coffee was pretty quick and short. I can sip tea throughout the day pretty easily, and have some that taste good cold and am not reheating it. There's some research on other health benefits as well, but for me it came down to taste.

If you like coffee, try black teas and chai style teas. If you try some greens or oolong teas, don't add boiling water. You'll scald the leaves and that makes them pretty bitter.

But it is your choice in the end. Tea helps me wake up when I'm tired. There's hot tea when it's cold out, iced tea when it's hot.  No one thing will work for everyone, and there's a lot of options."

Found a larger saddle online, and it felt weird at first, but you want to make sure that the pressure goes through your bones and not the soft tissues.  It is surprisingly comfortable when you get used to it.

How hard did you press when you started your self massage? If things are pretty tight you might need to start with less pressure for a while.
