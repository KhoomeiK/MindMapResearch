bipolar,eteeer0,t3_bzdnr8,1562730299.0,"Hi! 
I actually stopped the lithium because it wasn‚Äôt helping with my anxiety at all, kind of just making me feel tripped out and in a daze but not helping with anything and also made me feel sick. And since it wasn‚Äôt helping much I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be worth keeping up since it has some negative long term physical side effects (but who really knows about any of these newer drugs, right? Oy). I switched to lexapro 10mg and Rexulti 1mg, with Valium as needed. So far the rexulti is actually helping with my lack of appetite and racing thoughts/ manic spastic-ness. I think I really needed the SSRI with it because I was feeling so low before with the lithium? Very weird. I‚Äôm usually manic. The lexapro seems to really be working already, been on it almost a month now. At first I felt like garbage but now my energy is finally coming back and I almost feel manic but more level headed if that makes sense? I‚Äôm finally starting to feel like I can just BE, more so than I ever felt before. It‚Äôs strange. rexulti is super expensive though without insurance, so I‚Äôm kinda just riding this out to see what happens. So far so good, after lots of trial and error. Hope this helps!! I wish you the best of luck with lithium!!"
