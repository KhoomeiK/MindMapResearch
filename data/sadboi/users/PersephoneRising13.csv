witchcraft,fpy7lgs,t3_gg8fc0,1588997778.0," I spent the early evening earthing and absorbing the full moon energies by laying in the cool, late day grass. I gathered up my crystals and decided to take my monthly ritual of charging up my mineral friends ( the ammonite, labradorite heart, black moonstone, Hecate’s wheel in selenite... to name a few) to a new level by allowing them to soak up Gaia’s energies too. They looked so pretty and happy this morning that I let them spend the day charging in the sunshine too."

tarotpractice,foe1opq,t3_g6z2wb,1587694295.0,I’ve been the living embodiment of the Tower card since the lunar eclipse in July ‘18. I have endured two major breakdowns that landed me in the hospital last year. I’ve never felt more connected to spirits and guided since this happened and seem to have a close connection to the Underworld and often experience ones that have crossed over trying to get my attention. What are they trying to tell me?
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fo1dnk7,t1_fo0yg9j,1587431027.0,Same to you dear kindred !!!
schizoaffective,fnp94f8,t3_g2wwt1,1587141395.0,"Hi, twin! I have been seeing 144 since 2012, long before the official break that sent me to the hospital last year. 6 months later, I had my second episode which landed me right back in the hospital once again, only this time I kept seeing the numbers. Having them repeatedly come up was what helped to keep me anchored in reality. And while I don’t understand it I do have faith that somehow these experiences are part of my journey. I expect to be downvoted for saying such things because we all know the horrific reality of living with this condition. But the numbers for me helped to keep going and not give up. I worked my way through the second episode by focusing on the moments they popped up and seeing them as guideposts.

144 is part of the Fibonacci Sequence and a powerful number to have a connection with. I hope when you are seeing the numbers it gives you a sense of peace. 

You can hop over to r/soulnexus and see that there are many others on the path towards spiritual awakening that have had psychotic episodes. 

Take it for what it’s worth but I wanted to give you a positive spin on the numbers. 

Be well and stay safe, my friend!"

If one has researched ancient civilizations and their belief systems, these times were prophesied. And regardless if one subscribes to these beliefs, the uprising of those that have felt repressed cannot be denied. 

We all have free will and it’s up to us to decide how the timelines may unfold.

microdosing,fnie4ww,t1_fnidnba,1586978458.0,"That might be over the top too. The point of micro dosing is to take minimal amounts so you barely feel anything, but by entering the medicine into your body slowly and over toke the results are astounding. 

If it’s the high you’re after I’d start with 1- 1 1/2 grams to feel a subtle enhancement of reality.

Anything more, depending on tolerance, is going to have you tripping. It all depends what your ultimate goal is !"

Retconned,fn6o8dt,t3_fzu4jg,1586703931.0,It started a couple of years ago in my region. I like looking out the bedroom window and watching the night sky. One evening I noticed that the entire front yard was visible in the dead of night. I found it odd seeing as the moon was far from full yet everything seemed illuminated. This trend continues intermittently and still does at random times. I’ve never been able to explain the occurrences and you are the first person I’ve heard mention this phenomenon. I’ll be following along to see if anyone else has experienced this.
energy_work,fn6jnt6,t1_fn5zswj,1586700984.0,"Yes indeed. Ideally they’re all in spinning in a smooth alignment, but it all begins with the root. Work your way through the first three chakras by using techniques that are geared towards each specific one. The heart chakra is the bridge to the upper chakras. Each additional chakra working symbiotically helps to add to the feeling of wholeness . 

Lastly, remember to make it FUN! 

Chakra work will enable you to face shadows and the darker aspects of the subconscious mind. And it’s uncovering of core, ROOT issues, enabling the energy body to become more sensitive. 

May you, your friend, and loved ones be happy, healthy, and whole ! 🤗"

I’ve found shielding to be a great tool, envisioning a protective bubble of light around myself, casting the negativity out from my field. 

If you have access to a bathtub salt baths truly do wonders, but showers can work well too, envisioning all unwanted energies to shed off and spiral down the drain.

Whenever something traumatic happens my mind checks out and it feels as though life has become a dream. Physically present but mentally split off from the reality. The sensation can be compared to brain fog. 

Our current reality’s are changing by the hour. It’s A LOT for the brain to process and I find myself checking out more than being fully present.

I’ve been working on self soothing by taking salt baths, practicing meditation, crafting, connecting with friends online, and getting outside in nature.

As sensitives, it’s so important to get grounded and soothe the inner child who is frightened and afraid.
