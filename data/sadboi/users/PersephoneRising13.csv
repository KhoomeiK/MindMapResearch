They looked so pretty and happy this morning that I let them spend the day charging in the sunshine too."

tarotpractice,foe1opq,t3_g6z2wb,1587694295.0,I‚Äôve been the living embodiment of the Tower card since the lunar eclipse in July ‚Äò18. I have endured two major breakdowns that landed me in the hospital last year. I‚Äôve never felt more connected to spirits and guided since this happened and seem to have a close connection to the Underworld and often experience ones that have crossed over trying to get my attention. What are they trying to tell me?

schizoaffective,fnp94f8,t3_g2wwt1,1587141395.0,"Hi, twin! I have been seeing 144 since 2012, long before the official break that sent me to the hospital last year. 6 months later, I had my second episode which landed me right back in the hospital once again, only this time I kept seeing the numbers. Having them repeatedly come up was what helped to keep me anchored in reality. And while I don‚Äôt understand it I do have faith that somehow these experiences are part of my journey. I expect to be downvoted for saying such things because we all know the horrific reality of living with this condition. But the numbers for me helped to keep going and not give up. I worked my way through the second episode by focusing on the moments they popped up and seeing them as guideposts.

144 is part of the Fibonacci Sequence and a powerful number to have a connection with. I hope when you are seeing the numbers it gives you a sense of peace. 

You can hop over to r/soulnexus and see that there are many others on the path towards spiritual awakening that have had psychotic episodes. 

Take it for what it‚Äôs worth but I wanted to give you a positive spin on the numbers. 

Be well and stay safe, my friend!"

Retconned,fn6o8dt,t3_fzu4jg,1586703931.0,It started a couple of years ago in my region. I like looking out the bedroom window and watching the night sky. One evening I noticed that the entire front yard was visible in the dead of night. I found it odd seeing as the moon was far from full yet everything seemed illuminated. This trend continues intermittently and still does at random times. I‚Äôve never been able to explain the occurrences and you are the first person I‚Äôve heard mention this phenomenon. I‚Äôll be following along to see if anyone else has experienced this.
energy_work,fn6jnt6,t1_fn5zswj,1586700984.0,"Yes indeed. Ideally they‚Äôre all in spinning in a smooth alignment, but it all begins with the root. Work your way through the first three chakras by using techniques that are geared towards each specific one. The heart chakra is the bridge to the upper chakras. Each additional chakra working symbiotically helps to add to the feeling of wholeness . 

Lastly, remember to make it FUN! 

Chakra work will enable you to face shadows and the darker aspects of the subconscious mind. And it‚Äôs uncovering of core, ROOT issues, enabling the energy body to become more sensitive.

Our current reality‚Äôs are changing by the hour. It‚Äôs A LOT for the brain to process and I find myself checking out more than being fully present.

I‚Äôve been working on self soothing by taking salt baths, practicing meditation, crafting, connecting with friends online, and getting outside in nature.
