As for the ‚Äúblack sells‚Äù argument, the judges repeatedly told her that black does NOT sell well online. Maybe you could *see* the details of her clothing. But neither my husband nor I could actually see it and we have a top-notch computer. 

Now:

As demonstrated by research from statista, the preference for shopping online vs in-store decreases with age:

67 percent of millennials prefer to shop online
56 percent of gen-xers prefer to shop online
41 percent of baby boomers prefer online shopping
only 28 percent of seniors prefer online shopping

How do you think people are going to shop during the pandemic and while forms of social distancing last, which is likely to be at least one year? In reality, it may last indefinitely. This is a highly spurious argument, so I‚Äôm bowing out. 

Finally, if you‚Äôre in a metropolitan American city, look around when things get better. Nearly every single person on the street is wearing either black or some form of gray. I live downtown and I see it everywhere. So black IS what gets shoved down our throats. I mean, c‚Äômon people. She‚Äôs no Alexander McQueen. 

I did like Sander and Sabato, but despite their ‚Äúglobal‚Äù speechifying, those two were too European for Amazon Fashion. Global means American. I‚Äôm sorry, but you gotta be completely clueless about the politics of this.
