Obviously, Canada has a backward stance on its treatment of indigenous people, but that's hardly limited to government policy. We are discriminated against in near every setting, but that isn't because of refugees from Syria or North Africa nor is it because of immigrants from else where. The discrimination we face, the inequality we face, the lives we live are the product of white european colonists and no one else.

onguardforthee,er8wqrb,t3_c0reek,1560613092.0,"There seem to be a number of factors contributing to the radicalization of Albertans. 

Social media has made global right-wing ideology more accessible. 

Media outlets have become increasingly conservative due to pressure on print media.

White supremacists like the proud boys view conservative parties and politics as a means of achieving their goals. This has lead them to pursue positions within these parties and movements and to co-opt them for their own purposes.

Economically the oilfield bust has disenfranchised the young men of the industry making them susceptible to radicalization.

Climate change and efforts to halt it are seen as a threat to these disenfranchised extremists who see these policies as an attack on them and their livelihood.

 Islamic and race based prejudice, be it conscious or not, has been further flared by the influx of foreign workers and refugees stemming from the temporary foreign worker policy (harper) and the refugee crisis caused by the war is syria and famine in east africa (JT) 

The trump election is seen to add legitimacy to these biases and white supremacist ideologies. 

Further efforts by hate groups to present a centralist image (the alt-right) had made the ideology more palatable to less radical people.

I'm sure there are more possible contributing factors. Ultimately, we need to do our best to confront these ideologies, support unbiased news, educate people on climate change, and be caring and compassionate. 

I have a friend who believes we are facing the death rattle of a dying ideology that has plagued our world for generations."

However, the opposite perspective in this case is that op holds the key and by extension is still the holder of the revenue. Op then shares revenue with charity (like rent for space). What's sketchy is this disconnect and imbalace between the parties. What stops op from taking advantage of the non-profit, and in that case what is the legal course for the non-profit? Alternatively, what stops the non-profit from changing the locks? Like really, depending on where you are property rights are based on possession. So they change them, a legal hubub ensues and the onus is on op to prove they are the owner. Barring a contract how would they prove it?  

From a legal perspective I would have a contract charging 10% of revenue as payment and hand everything over to the non-profit. This is a clear cut legal scenario that would play out fairly for both sides. This is why I asked about a contract. Not that I don't appreciate generosity, but I've also seen 'generosity' used as a guise for extortion, and having clearly defined roles under a legal framework prevents this silliness.
