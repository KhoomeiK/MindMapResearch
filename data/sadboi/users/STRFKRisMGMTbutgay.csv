As noted the Arabs and Muslims did it to Afrikans. It was done in China. The Japanese did it to the VietNamese, Koreans and other ‘foreign’ nationalities before France took over. In fact each of the ‘great’ Afrikan feudal states did it to other ethnic Afrikan groups-Egypt, Mali, Songhay, Timbuktu, Ashanti were all exploitative states that acquired and maintained their riches and power through slave and serf labor, blood and wealth, often from violently conquered ‘foreign’ peoples, where they’d kill the men and enslave the women and children.

This is the tribal-feudalist mindset one reads about in the bible that was imputed to the god of the old testament. Where kings, and the god they patterned after them, would enslave people, kill off entire communities who wouldn’t submit to their domination and worship their deities (genocide), etc.

at the same time radfems are right about making fun of ""pro sex workers"" (rich girls who sell nudes) saying ""only fans is empowering"" or ""sex work is fun"" to a bunch of 18 year olds, while also saying any critique of sex work is attacking the poor people who need to do it. 

there are literally thousands of freshly 18 year old girls who will be told by Twitter vodka aunts with BPD that selling your nudes will never have problems (ie stalkers, leakers, blackmail, job opportunities, onlyfans eventually selling data, etc). people are literally making a database rn where you can type in a girls name and see her leaked nudes.

also, insurance companies/banks/investors/loans/employers/landlords/colleges  all use tons of internet database to screen for people who are impulsive, or high risk. 

smoking/having searched about tattoos or psychedelics makes your insurance go up. how much would it go up based on 

imo there is a slow push of commodifying women digitally, it starts with girls in 2005 getting more facebook likes if theyre wearing a low cut shirt and ends in virtually all girls over the age of 14  posting semi nudes and memes about being a bottom/making sexual tiktoks/having venmos in their bio/wearing bdsm gear in public etc

onlyfans is a literal extension of capitalist social media companies. they even started telling people what percentile they are in, ie you're in the top 5 hottest percent of onlyfans creators. this is DIRECTLY to make them compete and pit women against each other, the same reason Instagram even made likes.

I think I saw like 56% of strippers have BPD- many prostitutes have ptsd/cptsd - as much as rich narcissistic camgirls talk about sex work being empowering, if you read their forums they constantly talk about how shitty their clients are and how much the dissassociate

many sex workers were abused as children

men who don't think any of their female friends or family members have been sexually assaulted are like ""hurrr rape doesn't happen women just regret sex hurrr false reports""


a complaint from radical feminists is that men are trained to essentially talk more than women or talk over women.


when you look at the 3000 bazillion trans women in the replies to that tweet telling her she's wrong about her own experience, transphobic, it makes sense why terfs think trans women are just men who think they're immune to the internal problems that rise from being male .

you should have very little confidence in your views and ideas"
BPDlovedones,fmtmqy9,t1_fmstyfb,1586375398.0,"here's what I don't get: it seems like partners of BPD are codependent people, they still want normal boundaries in that they don't want to make anyone do anything they don't want to do, and their end goal is a healthy relationship. for example, I've dated two girls with BPD, one was shitty and evil, the other just seemed to start villanizing me after she made up criticism of her in her head, and then confirmed it to her friends. 


as much as bpd people talk about how they love the hardest and how they'll do anything, they are legitimately very selfish. the amount of BPD people who leave the partner they're abusing for a new person is obvious.


but victims of people with BPD seem to basically be the opposite."
