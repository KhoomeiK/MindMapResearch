dialysis,ffw52km,t3_ev9ztu,1580284697.0,"Hello! I am currently on dialysis due to kidney failure. I have a genetic disorder that‚Äôs extremely rare, called MYB9 Mutation. It causes extremely low platelets and I could be of some use if you‚Äôd like some advice. 

Are they giving you heparin? Obviously a blood thinner can be detrimental to your platelet problem but, clotting is super common without it. Do you use a fistula or chest catheter? My chest catheter is the only option for me. They keep us clear by only using enough heparin to fill the line, then pull that out before flushing it. It works for me. 

My platelets usually run around 5-10 with 3 being on the lower end. I bruise like a peach and usually am covered in them. Could they use Epogen while you‚Äôre on dialysis? Stay away from aspirin and things like that. Plus, chew ice. It‚Äôll help with weird cravings even if you don‚Äôt have fluid restrictions.  You‚Äôre anemic and that‚Äôll help when you can‚Äôt figure out what you want."
