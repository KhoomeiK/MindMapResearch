AskReddit,eyeus5n,t3_cwmz85,1567039313.0,"Kinda sensitive topic so...
I have always had depression and anxiety, and sometimes it got bad but it was always “manageable.” I also had kinda low self-esteem. 

Anyways, I got my first boyfriend and we hung out at his house for the first time and he ended up molesting me. He didn’t rape me, he just groped me forcefully and whispered, “Do you trust me?” Into my ear while I was frozen in fear until I finally got enough adrenaline and courage to push him away. He tried to do it a second time that same night but I pushed him away. 

After that, my self-esteem plummeted. I hated myself and I still do. I became suicidal, I questioned myself and blamed myself. It was hard, I didn’t feel valid in a sense enough to get help. My anxiety and depression took over and started controlling every aspect of my life. I watched myself degrade. 
I’m trying to get better, my anxiety caused a lot of problems, I couldn’t do normal things or focus in class. (This was in 9th grade) and my depression still makes me suicidal. Although I have moved past what he did to me, I still haven’t forgotten. Sometimes I’ll hear things or see people that remind me of him or something and my heart with just start pounding because I’ll start to panic. With time that got easier to manage as well. 

But it did ruin me. I still want to die, I have trouble trusting people and I hate my body. He set off a chain reaction that sent me spiraling."

But I do understand and a part of me want to fight and wants to help others fight but another bigger part just... can’t.

But I do know that high school is suppose to be the worst years of your life or whatever. I figured bullying at worst, maybe a lot of drama and ex’s. It just amplifies what’s already there so I guess they were right. 
And I do reach out whenever I feel like this to a counselor. But it’s summer break, I don’t like the hotline, and telling my family would suck. But you are right and thank you."
