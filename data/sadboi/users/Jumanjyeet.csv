My family is Russian and very blunt, so I can relate a little. Hopefully your sister knows that you don't mean things like ""get a job"" in a bad way. Unfortunately, intrusive thoughts happen even if you know they are false. I don't want to say anything definitive since everybody is different, but it's possible that comments like that could trigger self hating intrusive thoughts in her. Idk how close you two are, but it might help if you were to ask her if the blunt commentary hurts her.


>In your opinion does it hurt as bad as a physical injury? 

Physical injuries technically hurt worse, but I prefer physical injuries. This probably sounds contradictory so let me explain. You have probably heard of people with depression hurting themselves. I have cut myself. The reason I did this was because the emotional pain I was in was at an all time high, and it was absolutely horrible. It's hard to put into words how badly this felt. To say the least, I felt like I was drowning. So, I cut myself. When this happened, I became overwhelmed with physical pain, and this physical pain outshone the emotional pain. Technically the physical pain was greater, because it demanded my attention more than the emotional pain, but I chose to feel the physical pain instead.



>How does depression manifest itself into a physical weight as you've described? 

Are you talking biologically? Honestly I don't know. If I had to guess, I would say that my emotions make me tense certain areas of my body involuntarily and it makes a feeling like this. Let me know if I misunderstood your question.



>Is it possible that the depression is from overthinking about the things that need to get done?

I would say depression causes overthinking, and not the other way around. The overthinking then adds to the depression. A cycle that feeds itself... one of the many reasons its so hard to pull out of depression."
mentalillness,fmmgi7v,t1_fmmal1y,1586204844.0,"Good questions, and no worries I won't feel offended. I think its awesome that you are taking the time to dive deep to try and understand your sister.


I think the main differences between depression and being extremely sad is frequency, and cause/control. Depression can feel similar, but it takes a different toll on your mental state when its happening uncontrollably, without any obvious reason, and relentlessly every day for years. 


When your grandpa passed, did you ever have overwhelming feelings of grief that wasn't over a specific thought? Did you ever feel it physically in your body, as if a big weight was pressing down on your chest? If you've felt these things before, imagine now that your grandfather never passed and it still happens, but now it is every single evening for years, with no clear thought in mind as to the reason, and no way to stop or control it.


A common misconception is that if nothing bad actually happened and there is no cause, you can ""reason"" your way out of feeling this way. This just isn't really realistic. Yes, you can tell yourself that this feeling doesn't have a basis in facts, but the key thing is that this knowledge will not make the physical feeling go away. Regardless of if she ""should"" feel this way, the bottom line is that she does. Technically yes, you can feel bad but still ignore it, but this is not only exhausting but takes a ton of mental discipline to maintain. Think of it as being stabbed in the leg. Technically you can choose to ignore it and keep walking, but come on. That's really hard.

> If not, what causes an emotion or mental illness that extreme? Is it a traumatic experience? 

Okay so, this question is hard. We as a society aren't even close to fully understanding the brain and how it functions. But the best educated-guess answer to this for now is that there are multiple potential causes. It can be simply a chemical imbalance in the brain. It could be caused by a traumatic experience. In my case, the mental health pros that I see believe that I have the chemical imbalance, but that it manifested in me early due to trauma.


>Would being productive or going outside help with this?

This is also tricky to answer. Yes and no. If your sister is lying on the ground in the middle of a depressive episode, please for the love of god, do not try to drag her up off the ground and try to make her do things. Do not try to force depressed people to do anything. But in general, if she is able to incorporate good habits on her own, it might help with her mental state. But she has to do it ON HER OWN. Let me explain.

When she's in a good state, you can be supportive and encouraging. Be careful not to phrase anything as if she needs to change, because then the activity might become ""tainted"". If you tell her repeatedly that she needs to go outside more, she might do it, but the whole time she might be thinking ""oh my god I had to be forced to go outside, I'm pathetic"" and the productive activity then makes her mental state go down. But if you were to ask ""Hey, would you be down to walk around the block with me at 3:00? I want to spend some time with you, and I could use some fresh air"", she may do it and enjoy it, and maybe even do it on her own. And if she does it on her own, you could give positive encouragement, but again with this make sure to be more like ""hey that's awesome, good for you"", and not ""wow you actually started going outside, happy to see it"". Encourage and support changes that she makes, but do not try to force change upon her."
mentalillness,fmm8tk9,t3_fw324d,1586200919.0,"I want to first emphasize that it really is different for everybody. Its also important to know that it can manifest in multiple ways, even in one person.


For me personally, depression comes out in:

- Uncontrollable/intrusive negative thoughts that can get difficult to ignore. Sometimes it even comes out in a rhythm, and my fingers will tap out the syllables of a hateful phrase over and over. Like a song stuck in your head.

- Feeling as though you've been covered with a weighted blanket. Emotional state becomes extremely sad (even without a specific reason) and it gets really really difficult to move, as if someone turned up the gravity.

- Becoming ""stuck"" thinking about a specific terrible memory that replays over and over. This may be more to do with my ptsd but it can happen with lighter everyday memories that are just cringy. You think through it repeatedly, you obsess over every detail and what it means in the world and what it means about you, your thoughts are very loud and it's extremely difficult not to think about, so much that I will sit somewhere and stare into space for hours and it becomea difficult to register when someone is speaking to me. Imagine that somebody is trying to have a serious conversation with you about a complex topic, but at the same time you are heavily invested in a movie you're watching and are unwilling to miss a single plot point. Functioning in the real world in this state can be comparable to that.

CPTSD,fm5mxvp,t3_ft85mi,1585775980.0,"I had a very similar experience. Started trauma therapy, had an absolutely horrific nightmare there I was watching a security screen and it was myself as barely a toddler, going through let's just say horrible CSA from someone in my family. It was absolutely terrible and I woke up just shaking and it fucked me up for like a week and I couldn't even bring myself to talk to anyone about it. I had the same thoughts as you, wondering if this was a terrible repressed memory. Thankfully I realized that there was a very strong inconsistency. Again avoiding detail, but the setting played a part in the trauma, and I realized that I hadn't actually moved to that area until I was a teenager, so it wasn't possible that this happened in real life 

I can't speak for you and say that this wasnt a repressed memory, but it wasn't for me. One thing that a therapist told me about nightmares that helped with this, is that dreams don't usually recreate entire experiences, they just tend to recreate emotions and how someone made you feel. In real life, I feel really disgustingly betrayed and disappointed by the person who was the abuser in the dream. The dream exaggerated these feelings by making it CSA but it fed from the same branch of emotion.

CPTSD,flz5vn7,t3_fs2wvh,1585616203.0,Personally I would send her an email saying you don't think it's a good fit and that you will no longer be continuing to see them. Make all formal/professional

casualiama,flny5f0,t1_flmekzv,1585328094.0,"Oof, not really. I know I'm supposed to but it's hard to be motivated. I go on night time walks around my neighborhood on occasion, although not anymore obviously."
casualiama,flnxxne,t1_fllmh6h,1585327978.0,"I used to be huge into PC gaming, but for the past yearish I've been burnt out on it. I work on my PC and started working from home full time (pre-plague), so once work time is over it's hard for me to continue being on the PC for fun, you know? I want to change spaces.

So now I've started playing some light Xbox games like Minecraft and Dead Cells. I also love to draw, and I'm a huge fan of horror books.

The problem with using hobbies to cope with depression though, is that I lose motivation to start doing the hobby, or to even get better. The only way I can use these hobbies to cope is to catch it very early."
casualiama,flnrgwl,t1_fllzr60,1585324464.0,"HAHA, I also badly need to shower! Being quarantined with the guarantee that I won't be seen doesn't help with motivation. 

For the longest time, I used to think that it would never get better. I know that the down periods won't ever truly go away, but now I know that it does get less bad over time. Just five years ago, I used to self harm and sob on the bathroom floor in the dead of the night at least once a week. Now, that happens maybe once a month, sometimes less. Thank you for sharing your experience, it helps to hear that it also got better for you and that I'm not imagining my own improvement with wishful thinking. And it's reassuring to know that you're real enough to admit it won't go away completely."
