u_supersoonicc,fpshjao,t1_fpsgor2,1588873578.0,it's not that he particularly dislikes them he just doesn't get attached. He hates their smell even though they don't smell that bad and we clean them. He thinks having 7 rabbits is already too much and if they had litter there would be twice the amount. He's also angry because yesterday someone broke 2 cages doors and released one rabbit which we fortunately found after a few hours (she didn't run away far cos she's heavily pregnant and will give birth this week). At least he didn't eat them like he was planning to..ðŸ˜“

I'm a dog person too but cats aren't that bad although they are kinda lazy but that's usually a good thing sine you don't have to take them out for a walk every day.

selfharm,fkedxpw,t3_fhwiqc,1584111156.0,if he's going to go to counseling/ a therapist it takes time for him to open up. Even if he doesn't really talk there and doesn't really want to be there deep inside he probably knows he needs it and maybe even wants to go there but is too ashamed to tell it. DON'T GO WITH HIM TO THE COUNSELLOR/THERAPIST! My mum makes me go to a therapist and even though i kinda hate it i want to go there and kinda open up more and the only thing in the way is my mum's presence in the room.. no one wants to talk about these kind of things in front of their parents especially if they want to say something about them. You can go to the first 1-3 sessions but after it you shouldn't unless he asks you to. If he asks you to it's probably a 1 time invitation and you shouldn't start going with him there every single time. He might want you there at first but after he will get uncomfortable and probably will not tell you to get out just stop talking.. like me. I know I'm basically saying the same thing over and over again but it's something i wish my mum would understand..
