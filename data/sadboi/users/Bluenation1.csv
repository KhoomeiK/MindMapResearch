I think that if you do that then you either have a reason for it (in my opinion still not okey)  or you are very insecure. He probably left small breadcrumbs for you to pick up and give him small insurances on the things he is insecure about."

You should be very proud of yourself. I dont know your story, but its not easy to acknowledge the fact that ""you"" need therapy for your struggles.

That is not okey! I'm clearly not the one to give relationship advise, but are you sure this is healthy for you?"

relationships,fp5xpxt,t1_fp5v8yg,1588342142.0,Not at all. Thats why I said it. I dont want that to happen. I blocked her on everything today. Feels good actually (blocking her).
relationship_advice,fp5tgtn,t1_fp5safb,1588339523.0,"Thank you and you are right. Its totally unfair. Our relationship is based on trust. We are always truthful with eachother. I told her that my ex called when it happened and i told her about  the friend request. I think this will grow and ""eat"" me if I dont talk with her about this. 

I want to be fully committed, so maybe by talking with my lady will help me put everything behind me. We are two people in this relationship and it probably affect her and us more than i know right now."
relationship_advice,fp5pj8l,t1_fp5p0ng,1588336790.0,"hmm okey. I dont want her back, its a reason why we broke up. But its still unfair and yeah its not okey to give her a reason to doubt my faithfulness. I'v never been so much in love and loved a person so much as i do for my lady. I know it seems like im split and trick myself to say and think that, but i mean it. She is more than I could ever dream about. I dont want to loose her. Thats why I posted this so I can sort this out and put it behind me."
relationship_advice,fp5oh0y,t1_fp5nmft,1588335988.0,I agree. She was my first ''big love''. My lady deserves better and its unfair to her to keep this up. Should i maybe tell my lady about this or just put this whole thing behind me completely by deleting everything?
relationships,fp5o0fu,t1_fp5nnr6,1588335624.0,You are probably right. Its really unfair to my lady to behave like this. To be honest with you I dont really want her back. Its a reason why we broke up. Maybe its my ego that need  confirmations from her.
relationships,fp5noi0,t1_fp5lxh4,1588335356.0,"Thanks for the reply and for the hard truth.   


So after she called me I ofc told my Girlfriend about it. I also told her immediately when my Ex added me on facebook. I know it was stupid of me to answer her and I regret it, thats also why I told my lady that she called.   


You asked if I wouldn't like if she were behaving similarly with her ex. The answer to that question is that I actually wouldn't have anything against it. It ofc depends on the situation. Something similar has actually happened. When we stared dating she told me that she miss her ex and wants to contact him and try to be friends with him. They were bestfriends before they started dating. I told her I dont mind at all and that I understand her. They are now friends. This was before I stared to have my problems.  


I agree with you and I also agree with you on that she is not over me. I do have to change my behaviour. My lady deserves so much more.  I think I have to just let go and just move on and keep building my current relationship. I dont want to loose her or sabotage what we have. Maybe I should be honest with her and tell her?"

I think the original screen protector is garbage compared to some third-party protectors.  The original screen proector started to detach at the curve on the edges of the phone, so that's why it fell off. 

Note: some people might love the screen protector and thats great! This is just my experience and opinion."

I use 300mg and iv never felt better. I have learned to live with the side effects. My main side effects is constant headache and that the world feels sloooooow. I remember I got scared when I got my first depression on the meds. It felt like it lasted for ever. Usually my lows comes like a lightning from an clear sky, but this time it gradually got worse. I reccomend you talk with your doctor. Side effects will always occur with meds, but its not always good for you. 

Little advise: you should try to not change meds right away. Let your system adjust first and see if It works."
