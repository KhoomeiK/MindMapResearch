Live your life now and experience as much as you can. Through those experiences you may just be able to find peace.

I never had time or money for any of it, but I'd find ways to work things in.  Let's use the paint therapy I tried out.  Canvas and paints are expensive... so one paycheck, I bought a value pack of canvases. Next paycheck I bought brushes and an easel.  Next paycheck I got paints.  Now at this point, I was 6 weeks in to this process and I hadn't even painted anything yet.  But the idea that I was working toward something was the main point I stayed focused on. 

I also get overwhelmed very easily.  Had I attempted to just bust open a canvas and go to town, i would've ended up frustrated and annoyed with myself, probably trashing all my supplies and crying in my closet after. Instead, I set up a canvas on the easel, and didnt touch it for a week.  I looked at it every day when I got home from work. I'd stare at it when I was eating dinner. And it stayed blank the whole week.  Then I woke up on a day off and decided i wanted something red.  So i broke out every shade of red I had, and literally just slapped paint on the canvas until it wasnt white anymore.  I didn't actually paint anything... but at the same time... I did.  Does that make sense?

I hope you find your balance, and I wish you the best of luck in your journey."
depression,f62tfhu,t1_f62qs4p,1572666855.0,"I just read through your post about your first anxiety attack the other day, and it is all too similar to mine.  From what I've been told about that day, I was shaking, mumbling, hyperventilating, passing out, and I scared the shit out of my then girlfriend.

The hardest part is going to be dealing with the feeling of being a burden on others during those moments of anxiety. Some get it, some dont.  If you feel that way, pull your SO aside during a calm moment and explain it to them as best you can. You'll get emotional, you may not even be able to explain it properly, but communicate it in whatever way you can.  This will help your SO understand not only what they can do to help you, but also help alleviate the added anxiety and stress such feelings can place on you. If it makes it easier for you to physically hear it, explain that to them as well.  Theres no shame in asking them to comfort you during times of anxiety.

Take your approach to happiness in baby steps.  Dont try to fix all your problems at once. It's like eating an entire cake in one sitting.  Yeah its fuckin delicious and you'll enjoy yourself... but give it some time and you'll be shitting yourself and passing out. Same goes for depression and anxiety. If you try too hard with too much too quickly, you're going to find yourself exhausted and unwilling to continue.  But if you take baby steps, and attempt one thing at a time, you just might make it out the other side in one piece."

I was thrown from a moving vehicle by my mother at age 4 while being screamed at ""You were the biggest fucking mistake of my life"" as she drove off to kill herself. I remember that so vividly.

I was abused, molested, and raped every school day by my guidance counselor in 4th grade for 2 months straight. I can still smell his sweat. But I never told anyone, and now hes a teacher at a catholic school for boys. I know because in my shame of being unable to confront him, I looked him up, hoping to find that he was dead, and that I could be absolved of the possibility of him doing the same thing to other boys.  Instead, I find out that for the last 19 years, I've allowed him to walk free and ruin the lives of who knows how many other young men.  I can never forgive myself for that.

I was in a relationship for 2 years, then engaged for a year, only to find out my fiance was sleeping with about 7 other guys.  I had to find out from her father, who knew the whole time, and only told me a week before the wedding because he felt bad.  I dont trust anyone.  I havent been able to since then.

For 8 years straight I tried.  I shoved the daily suicidal thoughts aside, put on a smile, and tried to occupy myself with hobbies and anything that I could afford to do to try and create some happiness. I took up writing music.  I got into oil painting.  I learned how to build a house.  I learned how to work on a car.  I taught myself amateur astronomy.  An article I wrote detailing how to detect extrasolar planets from your own backyard was published in a science magazine.  I learned glassblowing.  I learned metalworking.  I read countless book series. I created art for people. I volunteered.  I worked at animal shelters.  I drove across country. I lived on a beach for a summer.  I lived in the mountains for a winter.  I've searched from one ocean to the other for something that would make me happy, when the only thing that would give me happiness, doesnt want me. My family.

30 years I exhausted myself putting in the effort. The 8 years after my last suicide attempt were given even MORE effort.  Where did I end up? More tired, more drained, more depressed, more anxious, more lonely, and more sad than I've ever been in my entire life."

As a 30 year old male with autism, I STILL struggle with certain aspects of what ""boundaries"" are and mean to different people. 

For some NT (neurotypical) people, boundaries are physical. They need a bubble. They prefer to not be touched.  They prefer their things dont be touched.

And then there are some NT people who have more emotional boundaries than physical. This is where it gets tricky to interpret what makes people uncomfortable and what doesnt.  After 30 years, I've managed to implement an ""educated guess"" when meeting new people, and I rarely seem to make others uncomfortable anymore.  But it does still happen on the rare occasion.

Your daughter has every right to not want someone around who makes them uncomfortable.  Will it be saddening to the autistic child? Possibly.  Or he could take it as a challenge to overcome, to better himself, to learn and apply his knowledge in order to better socialize with people in the future.

Best of luck to you and your daughter.  And please make sure she knows shes not wrong.  Theres a difference between being compassionate to someone disability, and allowing someone with a disability to get away with anything regardless of respect of boundaries."

Theyll ask a question, I'll be three words into my answer and they're interrupting me to ask me another, unrelated question.  It's like for fucks sake, I've been in this body my entire life and had enough medical problems that I KNOW when something is not right. But nobody wants to listen.

I had stomach ulcers at 11 that I asked my mom to ask my doctor about. 
I've had kidney stones (genetic causes not dietary) 8 times in my life.

Yet, due to the fact that I'm a 29 year old single male with no children, I ""make too much money"" to qualify for any sort of assistance, whether that be federal or state. I make approximately $1,000/year too much for Medicaid, and since I'm single with no kids making less than $22,000/year, I dont qualify for my city's low income medical assistance."

I dont have insurance or the $300+ for a specialist visit.  And I cant keep wasting time in the ER only to be told the same thing over and over and sent home with more laxatives that I could just buy over the counter.

Take a little less, maybe .05-.08g, but stay on an empty stomach again ...or..... take the same  .1g, and make sure you eat within an hour AFTER taking your md.  

The reason I say ""...or...."" is because if you change both of them at once, you wont know what was causing the zoning... the dose or the empty stomach.  Once you have that figured out, you can adjust accordingly."
microdosing,ewqnpwp,t3_cpnks7,1565671765.0,"Actually did this today! ...sort of.

I always use cannabis daily, as I have three herniated discs in my back and refuse to take pharmaceuticals. Today was my first day microdosing mushies.  I took 0.15g of dried Penis Envy this morning at 8am, and smoked a bowl right after (I always smoke to start my day, or I will be in so much pain its unbearable).

I had breakfast an hour later, and took 2 Tbsp of full spectrum cannabis coconut oil that I make with it.  

Today I was happier than I've been in a very, very, very long time.  I didnt get any visuals.  I didnt get any body high.  I didnt get any trippy feelings.  I just felt.... me.  I felt.... not annoyed.  I felt less angry at everything.  And god damn was I in a generally good mood all day.

I just got home from work, made dinner, and smoked another bowl.  I'll probably smoke one more right before bed in about fifteen minutes just to relax my back muscles enough to lie down.

All of this being said... everybody is different. Everyone's metabolism is different, processes things differently, and generally affects people differently.  I would only take as much dried mushies as you feel comfortable taking, and only decide to smoke if you feel like it's right.  If it doesnt seem like it's a good idea, or you're apprehensive... just dont do it. It's as simple as that! Never try to force yourself to do anything uncomfortable or frightening while using psychadelics.  It's not worth it, and entirely unnecessary. 

Best of luck in your journey!"

I've already had three heart attacks, so honestly I'm surprised that I'm still alive at this point. I had one cardiologist tell me I wouldn't make it to 30, and another tell me I'd be dead by 28... so I've already outlived the doctor predictions. I'm just basing my timeline on the rest of the deaths in my family.

Yeah, as a white male in southern Texas, most other white people assume I also share their racist beliefs, and then get fucking MAD when I disagree with them.  I'd be down to wear ""Fuck Trump"" shirts, but trump supporters down here get violent, and I'm not a violent person unless I have to be.  I dont like causing confrontation, even if I'm not in the wrong.

And yes, I do get that a lot lol.  I served 3 years in the military, got discharged over depression, dont get any benefits, was homeless for 2 years straight in Texas, living in my car... its been an interesting decade for me. I figure I can either let it consume me and fall, or I can use it as fuel to get some happiness before I die.

I'm so thrilled that someone might be able to take my experiences and learn from them.  I might just write a book before I go, too.

I dont plan on ending anything anytime soon.  However, the men in my family have an average life expectancy of only 34, and I turn 30 this year.  Due to this, I've decided to make the most out of what little time I may have left before I end up regretting everything I've ever done.

I live in the South US (horrid, humid summers filled with sweat and anger), I'm tired of blatant, overt racism, and I've always wanted to leave this state.  I visited Anchorage, AK five years ago, and I've decided that's where I need to be.  

I'm gonna get away from city life, leave my toxic family behind, and never look back.  I have a job offer from the company I work for to take over their Loss Prevention team for the entire state of Alaska, and I jumped on it.  Keeps me busy, gives me something to do that i do well (inventory control and paperwork). 

But I'll get to do it all in the most beautiful state I've ever been to.  Even if i still end up being single for the rest of my life (been alone since i was 21), at least I'll be able to enjoy my life for once before i die.

I'll probably continue my art as well, as it has become a key part of my self therapy.  I also dabble in, and write for, an astronomical society who helps educate amateur astronomers. Perfect for Alaska :)"
