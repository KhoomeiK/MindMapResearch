You also need to find something to replace it, even if it's not the healthiest thing in the world right now. Getting sucked into a TV show or game for instance. Once you're a week off ANYTHING related to porn, esp edging, it may be easier for you. Diet and exercise are also a huge help. I wish you the best!"

Even though I realized it was a problem at 27, and I quit cold turkey at that time, I had many occasional relapses for a number of years after. I have gone over a year without it I think twice since then but end up relapsing when I get out of relationships and what not, but right now I'm not using and single so I think it's a good sign that I might finally be done. I think 30 days is amazing and I think you can do it again! Depression is tough for sure but you just have to remember how bad it makes you feel and recall that feeling prior to giving in.

I haven't experienced that actually in years now, because I actually started my porn free journey many years ago but had a relapse last summer/fall. I believe the issues with arousal come from severe use over a long period of time, and can equally be reversed with enough abstinence 100%! You just need to be serious and not peak or edge or whatever because that will just continue to restrengthen the association. It is normal to have flatlines and such in the beginning but I can assure you that issue does eventually go away on its own, assuming it's cause is psychological and not biological"
pornfree,fi3mz5z,t1_fi3jg7a,1582123162.0,"Sure thing! So here's some tips that I think will really help... 

My biggest thing is limiting the amount of dopamine I get from other sources. I find that once I get an unhealthy dose from something like too much TV or junk food, the brain just wants more and it specifically wants it from an even higher source, like porn. So if you can prevent the snowball before it gets too big, that makes the whole process so much easier. So try grabbing a book instead of the remote or grabbing fruit instead of candy, etc. This may sound crazy but I've seen it happen over and over where if I give my brain a big hit of dopamine, instead of being satisfied, it just wants more.

Another thing that helps me so much is exercise. Exercise will reduce your stress, and reduced stress leads to less wanting to self medicate with porn. I like cardio in the AM and strength training in the evening.

Meditation is amazing. If you can get even 10 minutes in in the morning it helps expand your consciousness and when you're about to relapse you'll begin to ponder ""wait, *why* am I about to do this?"" Meditation adds that little space in between that's necessary to prevent a relapse

Stay busy! Focus on what's going well and what you're grateful for. Go out and try new things. Sometimes the best strategy, especially early on, is to just not be home alone and bored when you will be the most tempted!

Lastly, just love yourself and remember that even if you slip up, it's all about overall progress. Do not beat yourself up and add more shame. Just forgive and try again. Each time it will be better and better until one day you look back and laugh at your old ways! I hope this helps!"

addiction,fg2045a,t3_eweygm,1580435844.0,"One thing not a lot of people know is that sugar addiction can sometimes just be driven by the bacteria living inside you. They need it to survive, so they hijack your tastes and preferences. Sounds weird and made up but I assure much research is being done in this area. The ""microbiome"" refers to the total amount of both beneficial and harmful bacteria living on and in you, mostly in your large intestine. Which species you are dominant in determines so much of your health and metabolism. Breaking a sugar addiction is extremely hard yes, but if you can at least start with the realization that it's not just YOU who has the taste for sugar, but rather you are under the influence of another force, it may help you feel a little better. Check out the movie Fed Up, it's an amazing documentary about sugar addiction, or you can read any book by Mark Hyman or Gerald Mullin. Or just DM me, I've know how bad sugar is for years now and I've accumulated lots of resources I'm happy to share. Good luck!"

The first thing I might try if I were you is to replace sodas with just flavored sparkling water. You're def used to just the habit of drinking something carbonated from the can right now so without eliminating that you can at least replace the can with something that has no sugar. The snacking is potentially triggered by emotional elements or related to anxiety, and that's something to address more seriously at a later time. For now just see if you can switch to sparkling water (SO many options these days in terms of brand and flavor). Are the sodas you drink caffeinated? If so you can have a little coffee in there too if you find that you still need that at this time. I know how you feel and I'm here for you!"
