yes, the laughing gas isn't something one should do, but imo i made a huge step forward by not even wanting to do coke anymore. it just disgust me.
anyways, thanks for your reply!"

sex,ffwyffl,t1_ffwvsqv,1580313819.0,tbh that was what i was just thinking. I'm about to move further away (we live 3 hours apart atm and it will be 4 then) and starting a new chapter. I'll just see how things work out i guess.
sex,ffwxflh,t1_ffwvw2l,1580313198.0,"the first time with her and her ex was like 3 or 4 years ago? and with her now boyfriend for about 5 months. so maybe it will be my longest relationship in a way haha
and of course i do love my best friend. question is if it is right for a relationship. but you guys are starting to convince lol"
sex,ffwx9nh,t1_ffwwo9l,1580313093.0,"I'll always make their relationship priority number one!
happy for you that it's working out. and yes, i feel you. the cuddle piles are one of the best parts about it!"

AskReddit,ffwrs18,t1_ffwrkhp,1580309451.0,there is literally a wikipedia article about holocaust denial.
AskReddit,ffwrgms,t1_ffwrcfd,1580309228.0,"well, there are people who are denying it."
sex,ffwpbt0,t1_ffwn42g,1580307697.0,"good point. gotta say that I'm not a relationship person anyways, longest was like 6 months or so.
I'd say my biggest fear would be that they get into a huge fight, me standing in betweend and what if one of them doesn't want it anymore but the other does? i mean if i wanna get out, okay. but what if i get too attached to one of them and couldn't handle a part-breakup? idk just some fears. i guess you have to talk it through very well beforwhand to avoid bigger problems."
sex,ffwmov5,t1_ffwm7m0,1580305685.0,i would probably actually do this. but i think there's problems  ahead with that.

AskReddit,ff8yn3t,t3_esbze6,1579700241.0,i think most people who give a bit of shit about their appearance look good. what makes someone gorgeous for me is also their posture and just how they vibe with you.

bipolar,fc64ve7,t1_fc635z8,1577472322.0,"This sounds dumb, but i stopped taking the meds months ago and also I didn't make another appointment with my doc (he said something like ""and now you're coming to me to cry?"" and was an asshole) but I'm doing fine. also, since I'm doing better, the situation with my friend got a lot better too, so i guess it's true, he just wants to see me doing better."

TalesFromYourServer,fbgai84,t1_fbg01db,1576842546.0,"first of all, i do sometimes tip in convenience stores, even if that is a totally different thing imo. second, i just think it's far more common to tip a waiter/waitress.
the thing is, i never complain about my tips, and there are people who give no tips (mostly regulars who drink a few beers or so) but never in my waitress career have i seen a tip like this.
and yes sure, i get a salary but it's not about me not being able to live through the month now but i was just a little bit upset when it happened yesterday."

ChoosingBeggars,fbezwxg,t1_fbezhel,1576798012.0,he has a business himself and i guess he wouldn't go have dinner with all of his workers if things were that bad.
ChoosingBeggars,fbezv1o,t1_fbez69o,1576797973.0,the tip is not included in the price.
ChoosingBeggars,fbezu54,t1_fbexlh5,1576797955.0,yes it is. normally i get 7-10% or even more.
TalesFromYourServer,fbezqal,t1_fbez7s3,1576797878.0,it definitely ia is my country. i get a 7-10% tip normally.

bipolar,fanoxsa,t3_ea3lc3,1576246981.0,"hey, i can relate. i harmed myself when i was younger (around 13 or so?) but never really wanted to end my life. i have been diagnosed with bipolar in march and for a long while after that i felt like i wasn't really important to the people around me. i thought they didn't really need me. i always tried but i felt like i wasn't enough. 
i can tell you, it will get better. after some time i began to feel appreciated again and as if i can make some people's day better. i assure you it's worth surviving for sure, your are loved."
