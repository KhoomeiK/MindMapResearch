When I was little, I‚Äôd have a lot of grandois thoughts and thought I saw angels or the sun would be calling to me by its rays through the window or I would think God was calling me to a certain part of the yard.

They‚Äôve been wanting to put me on antipsychotic because I get a lot of delusions..kind of feeling crappily trapped
bipolar2,fniu01j,t1_fnibse9,1586986336.0,"Interesting. I get hypomanic when I‚Äôm coming down. Like, the stages usually go, in the climbing of the high,!i get EXTREME anxiety and then I teach myself to calm down and distract myself, sometimes I‚Äôm not able to calm down and I have to force myself to sleep or I can calm down and I‚Äôm floating in this calm bubble of hearing voices and seeing things and just going with the flow and then as I‚Äôm coming down I get this heart racing euphoric high where I want to create/do things/chug a coffee and go hiking or something. Sometimes it‚Äôs not euphoric and it‚Äôs just all this extra energy. I‚Äôve had to say goodbye to sativas. I‚Äôm going to be looking into indicas. I‚Äôm euphoric for half a day and then plunge into suicidal and then slowly build to hypomanic and plunge again into suicidal. All within a 4 day span"

bipolar2,fnfo5qk,t1_fnfn6vj,1586911980.0,That‚Äôs an awesome idea. I used to drink a lot and quit. Sativas were fine and then I started getting extreme anxiety/hypochondriasis so I had to quit. Looking into indicas

BipolarReddit,fn8tmev,t1_fn8sa4l,1586749922.0,"I have never experienced the physical signs of strong hypomania/mania like I did on the antidepressant. I get hypomania without anything but it‚Äôs pretty mild, I just get super creative, sleep isn‚Äôt very much different but with lexapro, I had vibration in my body, like I was strung up on coke. Will that eventually happen if I‚Äôm not medicated? In short: if the episodes will continue to happen, will they get worse to that point if I‚Äôm not taking anything?"

bipolar2,fm6i9dp,t3_ft7ujw,1585794672.0,"Definitely they are the worst. I experience two different mixed. Mixed depression looks like all this mental energy, 123 projects, the push to get everything done but my body isn‚Äôt going to move to the demands of my mind. I literally spent 12 hours in one place researching/hyper focused on all the WRONG things‚ÄîAnd then the more dangerous, Mixed hypomanic, is this extremely self-angry restless ‚Äúlooking for risky things‚Äù kind of deal where I‚Äôm convinced I am the chosen one who will change the world while I‚Äôm also wanting to cut my flesh and speed down backroads at 3am.

IAmA,flz99ju,t3_frv7op,1585618363.0,"Do you need to be struggling with sleep issues to have bipolar 2? I have been doubting my diagnosis since day 1 because while I do have highs and lows my sleep remains the same. I work night shifts so I often go to sleep around 3am every night, some nights I‚Äôm able to stay up till 7 no problem and other times I fall asleep quickly before or near 3/4am. During hypomania, I can sleep a solid 5 hours but will often wake up a lot after that and then go back to sleep because I‚Äôm almost always tired upon waking, sometimes I can roll out of bed and will feel the energetic wave and sometimes I don‚Äôt leave my bed till 1/2. When I am feeling extremely creative and excited about projects I don‚Äôt WANT to go to bed and i won‚Äôt sleep, making me feel sick and weak the next day..I am extremely sensitive to stimulants and I definitely have all the other symptoms but the sleep thing isn‚Äôt a symptom for me, would that mean no bipolar?"
