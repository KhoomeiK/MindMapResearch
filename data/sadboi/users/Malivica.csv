succulents,fr3kaub,t3_gmd7nd,1589859267.0,I have one that I was given by a resident at a retirement home I use to work at. The lady said that she wouldn’t be able to keep it alive. It’s now growing more and more each week. I kept her up to date with pictures. Such a lovely plant.

mentalillness,fr05aro,t3_glw1v7,1589784185.0,I feel that also. It feels like everyday is one super long day. Plus my sleeping schedule is off. Even my kids sleeping schedule is off. I’m ready for some sort of normal.
schnauzers,fqzxo02,t1_fqzwryh,1589778014.0,Thank you!
schnauzers,fqzt8sv,t3_gkl0em,1589774829.0,I’m so sorry for your loss. My heart goes out to you.
mentalillness,fqwb8k5,t3_gla6h1,1589698391.0,"Do you think you could maybe make a small list of a few things and do that first? Make your bed as soon as you get up. No matter what.

If I’m having an off day I’ll tell myself that if I can get a few things done then I can do what I want. It helps. I’ll still behind in house chores but at least something got done."
mentalillness,fqwainl,t3_gl3vd3,1589697727.0,Do there’s help with anxiety much? I find myself unable to sleep because I get anxious at night.
succulents,fqw8avt,t3_gkjbkv,1589695751.0,I love it!
