BipolarReddit,fmtp9gd,t3_fwyi4o,1586376641.0,"Lexapro caused my episode that induced my diagnosis. It took about 2 weeks for me to experience symptoms of hypomania - watch out for irritation, and a sense that all of your feelings and emotions are valid in a really intense way. I stopped sleeping and stopped eating and lost about 45 pounds the 3 months I was on it. These were my first symptoms that ultimately led to a complete breakdown where I started screaming because I had no idea where I was / why I was in an argument with someone etc. PM me for more details / advice!"

UTAustin,fklfawo,t3_fj2lnl,1584305079.0,"From someone who did it and was in one of *the* sororities - do not do it. I made my best friend out of it which it great but we essentially hate the system in it’s entirety and wish we had lived on campus in dorms freshman year, not in the off campus ones, and made friends by joining clubs / just being social on campus instead. It really sucks you into a high school hierarchical way of thinking if you let it and it’s just best to spend your money elsewhere. Hope this helps!"

I go to one of the mega churches in HP with my parents (thank the Lord it’s not Watermark), but still, it gets exhausting seeing people believe and read the Bible every week, yet continue to not see how they could actually apply those lessons to the real life people 5 minutes away from their community. I’m so glad you get it!"
depression,f80v1h5,t3_dyazjo,1574139143.0,"I was not appreciative of my mom when I was a young teenager, I’m 21 and she is my best friend, my sister, my confidant, and the person I need the most. If she had been depressed when I was a teenager, I’m sure she could have easily felt like I would be better off without her. I would most likely not be alive if my mother had died. Please, always think about the future for your kids. They will appreciate you and need you more and more the older they get. You are loved and wanted and needed in life, don’t forget that."

My boyfriend and I are getting close to moving to a new city together, away from his very BPD mother who has always felt I’m “taking him away from her”.

RBNSpouses,f404obn,t3_dimsxp,1571284958.0,"Please message me. My boyfriend had an intense trauma and we went through a period of about a year and a half of him having anger issues and not connecting the dots. The only thing that helped was him working through the trauma on his own. If he is wanting/willing to be in therapy to work through his trauma so he doesn’t have these anger issues anymore, that is the only way you will be able to work through this. Please please reach out if you want more details."

How are we not all against him? He literally only has relationships with North Korea, Russia, SAUDI FUCKING ARABIA, and now is trying to extort the Ukraine. How are republicans defending an authoritarian dictator? How are they defending his cozying up to communism? It’s sickening and a defamation of history and of 20th century international politics. DONT SCREAM THAT SOCIAL PROGRAMS ARE SOCIALIST THEN SAY YOU SUPPORT A LAWLESS AUTHORITARIAN COMMUNIST LOVER. Fucking shit."

Anxiety,exsgk6k,t3_cua4v9,1566543761.0,"Okay really weird but I’ve been dealing with this all summer. I wasn’t sure if it was because of my anxiety which I had had problems in the past with or if it was stomach. First reading your post I thought it was obviously anxiety, but after you said the thing about coffee and milk I think that might be it. Acid reflux even small can be brought on originally by anxiety and then exacerbated with diet issues - the main ones being caffeine, bubbly drinks, and dairy. The effects of acute acid reflux are usually morning stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, feeling full, etc. I would try cutting those out and maybe taking a 10 minute walk before bed and see if that helps. This is exactly what my doctor told me literally 4 days ago. I hope this helps!!"
Anxiety,exsg0q6,t3_cu9t48,1566543251.0,"Hi, from someone who did not have a good freshman year of college, do not worry yourself too much over this. Remind her that freshman year is hard for everyone and no matter how cool and well connected everyone else seems they are feeling the exact same way as she is. The people with friends at this point are putting on a show and just trying to find people. I really came into my own and found my people and happiness junior year. College is a journey, it’s not going to be happy most of the time because life isn’t always happy most of the time. Life becomes happy when you can learn to be happy on your own, which is painful and takes years. But - I learned the most important lessons of my life through the pain of freshman year. I’m the person I am now because I had to be alone and dig deep in myself and discover who I am without all of my safety nets around me. Remind her to join things and volunteer for things that matter to her, getting an in person job on campus can also be really helpful. There are also usually freshman interest groups at most colleges so that freshman can meet each other. Take every opportunity she can get but don’t expect the world from every opportunity. For me it was an enlightening, wild, horrible ride but I wouldn’t trade my college experience for anything. Feel free to show this to your sister and I hope it helps ease some of your worries."
Anxiety,exsff2f,t3_cu340i,1566542698.0,My dog is a very independent collie - spends most of her time wandering the house and sleeping in random spots now in her old age. The only time she has ever cuddled with anyone in our family (I swear we give her literally everything in the world she just has her own little unique personality haha) is when I was having a panic attack when my parents were out of town. She came up and laid right on my feet and started licking my face which she never does and whining until I calmed down. Dogs truly are the best emotional support in the whole world.
PoliticalDiscussion,ev9w1tn,t3_cd68bb,1564332669.0,"This is the opinion from someone who lives in Texas and knows / went to school with many illegal immigrants. 
This whole thread is full of ignorance on both sides. Most illegal immigrants I know are not working low skill jobs. They are nurses, they are the heads of the construction company, they’re working at a tech firm etc. All of their children are in 4 year colleges or technical schools. They are paying taxes, they’re paying student loans, they’re paying interest rates. Most of them have social security cards. Large cities in Texas typically do not crack down on illegal immigration nor do they mind it because it actually is IMPROVING our economy. The best economies / job markets in the country right now are Austin, Dallas, and Houston. There are hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants in all areas, helping the communities become better not worse. All of these conversations are so obviously being had by people who have never interacted with illegal immigrant communities."
PoliticalDiscussion,ev9k4gw,t3_cdvj8x,1564323991.0,"I think Trump and others are forgetting how much the longtime republicans despised Hillary Clinton. My best friend and my dad both voted for Trump in 2016, and their exact words were “I don’t know what trump is going to do, but I know what Hillary is going to do.” And both of these people have vowed now to vote for whoever is running against Trump. Many college kids in 2016 in the south did not vote, because the way they were raised they could never vote for Hillary Clinton, but also did not want to vote for Trump. I think there’s this idea that everyone who voted for Trump was for Trump, but a lot were just anti-Hillary and anti-establishment Democrats. I think Trump is going to have a much tougher time with someone like Joe Biden who many of the older and younger American people like and relate to and trust. He’s also going to have a tougher time with someone like Andrew Yang who is also not an establishment Democrat and does not have a history in politics to make fun of or twist in Trump’s own sick way. I could be completely wrong, but in my communities this is what I saw the most of."
PoliticalDiscussion,ev9iej2,t1_euw5f3n,1564322632.0,"What I’ve seen through my research is that the problem goes back directly to redlining and denial of housing in the 40’s 50’s and 60’s after WW2. An entire successful, many much more economically independent than today,  generation of black Americans were denied the right to buy a home, thus creating NO generational investment money. I think Mayor Pete has brought up really interesting ideas when this relates to the ‘scary’ word  of reparations. He brought up looking at the districts that were redlined, seeing how the black community is there today (usually still impoverished) and then giving extra funding to those communities and school districts."
