I haven't go to therapy since, but I'm dealing with dysphorish feelings since I had a medical situation on my coccyx.

The thing is that finding help was really hard because doctors didn't took it seriously, there was a risk of malpractice and to finally get surgery I had to travel.  There was a point where I thought I would have to live with a deformed fractured bone on my back.  I had surgery but I still look myself at the mirror too much, I'm almost 24/7 touching my back.. I can't ignore my back because even thought it's better now, there's still a protuberance.."

I felt down for a couple of days and even felt the urge to write him about a movie I watched as an allegory of how he destructive he is.  At a way more minimal scale, searching for him brought back the spiral... I knew that if I pursued the feeling I can go back to the old patterns that almost destroyed me (literally) so that's when I knew that searching for him put me at risk, that it was irresponsible because I could loose myself again.

Friends act cold, being outspoken is being dramatic, being yourself is not  ""aesthetic"".

Some of the little stuff that helped me those first weeks was to purge and create. I was beginning a new chapter and for that I needed to refresh myself.  So for example, sounds cliche af but I went to the salon and made myself pretty.  It fucking works, change my mind lol.. Then I realized that I was abandoning my home the time I was on that relationship so I decided to clean and that meant throwing out a lot of garbage out of my closet.  I found a ton of stuff that was his and I'm not going to deny that I destroyed it lmao.  I was pumped so I ended up changing the colors of the walls and buying some new furniture.  My room is other place, one I love so much! The place where I suffered so much no longer exists.  I also made a mural for my parents and creating that was super fun.  I wandered looking for meaning in small things, I bought a notebook and I just write down random stuff that comes into my head.  Suddenly something beautiful happened, I started to remember who I was.  I remembered old songs that I liked and listening to them again made me reconnect with myself.  I started to go out to places I always wanted and that included a concert.  I took care of my health conditions and I'm getting more closer to family members.  I know I'm healing, it has been slow but full of learning.  My friend, you are already, slowly but surely, healing <3"

NarcissisticAbuse,f8lovrv,t1_f8lfmpj,1574624150.0,Yeah and maybe it's just how it's but it adds up to the unfairness.. I just wish I could expose him to everybody but it's not possible without harming my own reputation
NarcissisticAbuse,f8lo1c9,t3_e0uqon,1574623968.0,"Hold on to your goal,  I know it's difficult but I believe you'll survive this moments of impulse.  I've been there.  It helped me to have in mind that I was a vegetarian already.  I believed on my will power, I'm resilient and when I make a decision I stick to it.  So can you, search for that in you, let the storm pass.  It was a trigger and it may help to avoid them, find a substitute.  You're not alone, once he cheated on me going on a date with another to the theater and they watched one of my favorites: Pirates of the Caribbean.  They ruined the movie for me so I avoided it for months and I'm slowly exposing myself to it, through the music because I love Hans Zimmer so much.  It gets better, I rarely cry now.  It was totally worth it to resist, so please do, I believe in you!  Sending cyber hugs so strong that leave you without breath!!! We got you, you can do this!"

NarcissisticAbuse,f8li0fq,t3_e0rgwg,1574622328.0,">I want you to hurt. I want you to be exposed. I want you to feel pain. I know, though, that doing anything will only keep me mentally caged to you.

I'm so stuck on this feeling!! For almost a year I've been avoiding any contact even when he tries, but I cannot let go of the feeling of injustice.  I want him to be exposed, to hurt.. it's the only way I could completely let go.  When I dumped him I immediately told some close people and it hurt me even more the fact that they didn't cared at all!! I'm not even sure if they believe me.  My ex best girlfriend even mocked me and made it a gossip.  People say they care about mental health when tragedies happen, but not when you're actually asking for help"

NarcissisticAbuse,f8ld9jb,t1_f8jm5se,1574621189.0,">Yes absolutely. I think I cried and felt shaken by it for some day‚Äôs afterward. The nex was exactly like this. He was also a writer which made it feel especially close. The way he let other random people who loved him threaten their well-being while she suffered and had to clean and prepare everything was so awful.

That's how I feel.. I've been googling about the movie all day, I'm disturbed reliving everything.  What about the fucking look in his eyes when he was unsatisfied for no reason.  Not knowing what's wrong, what's missing when you're already doing everything! I've been there"
NarcissisticAbuse,f8lc901,t1_f8i56nb,1574620943.0,">You can have your own closure (therapy helps) but don‚Äôt expect it to be mutual and don‚Äôt expect or go to the narc for closure. I‚Äôve seen Mother too, I absolutely could relate to the way she gave up everything and then he took even her dark heart.

I don't like therapy, they sugar coat everything and make the victim responsible.  It doesn't feel like real closure to not expect anything from anybody but me, it was me who suffered the injustice and also the one with homework? I would just love to see him pay, and I understand I won't see that ever and it sucks ... but thanks for the advise.  I feel better today, this movie was just a lot.  It's impossible to watch it without reliving the experience.  I can also relate to the feeling of giving it all when there's nothing left..."

BPD,f8h4mo3,t3_e0t61a,1574569414.0,"I guess it depends on where you navigate, I've found support on reddit thanks to this community... I don't understand the hatred because even with our the negative side of BPD, it's all about strong emotions, I consider myself to have great qualities like honesty and empathy... qualities that so many times non BPDs seem to lack.  I received the diagnosis a year and a half ago and I have my doubts about it but assuming it's true then I really still appreciate myself for my values.  Love your essence, the thing that don't change about you under any circumstance.  That's the real you, not a diagnosis."
NarcissisticAbuse,f8h2mjp,t3_e0rmru,1574568626.0,"I feel you, it felt the same for me.  I was so angry all the time and I still am.  The feeling of unfairness, of not being able to punch back for everything he has done... What worked for me was to break up and cut all kinds of contact.  I blocked him every where and also I cut ties with his friends.  Then venting, it helps so much to have someone who listens and sometimes strangers on the internet are the best for this so good for you for sharing this with us.  Don't doubt to reach for help whenever you feel drowned in your own feelings.  Also it helped me to reconnect with myself, taking a pause and doing something radical for me.  I didn't realized I abandoned my house and appereance during the time I was there, so I remodeled my room, painted a mural and why not, changed my hair color.  All of this is refreshing as fuck.. but honestly I'm still working on it.  This are just some tips that I share just in case it helps.  Don't forget we are here for you <3 you're not alone. Trust me, it slowly and gradually gets better.  I'm at a much better place after almost a year.

Also, about the anger, it helped to take some material stuff he left at my house and destroyed it.  Sounds stupid but helped heheh so if you have something you would enjoy to break, feel free!"
NarcissisticAbuse,f8h0ria,t1_f8gzs1b,1574567896.0,"You're absolutely right, it's just so hard to understand because it all felt so real for me, I really loved him, so so much.  Is there a way to make closure? I'm strong, I have will power, it's the first time I've felt really tempted to make contact, it's just that no matter how long it is and how much I've progressed, I feel like I wont move on until I have closure, until he ""understands"" or pay for what he did, until people acknowledge and believe me.  It has always felt like nobody cares of what he did and it cost me so much and still does.  I'm sorry I'm just venting, but if you have something to say about it feel free, I really need answers"
NarcissisticAbuse,f8gyew8,t1_f8geo1q,1574566932.0,">Hahaha yes I listen to this all the time! Another one of my faves is ‚Äúbird set free‚Äù by Sia. The lyrics describe leaving an abuser SO well.

I love Sia so much! I can relate to most of her songs but yeah you're right about this one <3"

BPD,f8d1g25,t3_e05o5s,1574475447.0,"Everyday.  I'm only ""BPD"" when exposed to relationships that are unfair.  A patriarch father, a narcissist boyfriend... when not I'm totally ok.  Isn't it only natural to react extremely when exposed to extreme situations? If when they're gone the ""bad behavior"" is gone, is it really something wrong with me? Or is it that women are expected to behave? Can't I be outraged? I've suffered from depression in other moments, yes, but the ""BPD symptoms"" were only there when I was around those motherfuckers.  I have no regrets."
sex,f8czdvd,t3_cj60ph,1574473713.0,"I'm totally attracted to men who are open and willing to be sexy and definitely bisexual men are the most attractive for me (I'm bisexual too).  I've discovered that after being with a guy who was willing to do stuff that's not ""typical""  I'm now not attracted to men who are trapped in their fragile masculinity (maybe I never was).  Some of them are beautiful but if their just being .. you know the typical male who doesn't care about his appearance and wouldn't seduce me I just won't feel anything.. that's how I've got to know my sexuality idk.    


So yeah, I'm not only attracted to fluid men, they are the only men I'm attracted to."
