I was cool with starting my son out in a church school but my husband couldn’t get his head around it. Had more to do with his discomfort of entering a church and feeling phony than anything else. 

Tbf, in registration they ask lots of religion based questions and our families relationship with god. We felt compelled to lie but then realized how wrong that felt. And is. Lol."
breakingmom,fi6vkf2,t3_f6taft,1582208489.0,"My mom... lol. 

I was 20, she was recently divorced and had just started to date again, had just bought a house to start over, and was really enjoying it. 

I had just started really paying for all my adult expenses with my husband of a year. We got married young and she wasn’t fully supportive of it. But she accepted it, too. 

We told her in the most proper way we could, at a family dinner with just the three of us. Her immediate response..? 

“..... But my life just became about ME..!”

I think it’s super funny, considering I know her and she was in a very self care state at that time and she knew that she would be very involved in our child’s life... but telling other people, they always thought it was the worst response ever lol. I didn’t love it. She was hesitant to be supportive in the moment but overall, she was happy for us. Just overly cautious about her excitement. 

On the bright side, we were EXTRA nervous to share about #2 because I didn’t think she would approve because she would have all kinds of opinions about finances and such. But she is legitimately happy and excited this time around! Probably because it’s a grand daughter but hey, I’ll take what I can get lol"

Parenting,fi25myd,t3_f5wrp3,1582072020.0,"You really are making me think about my future as a mom... mines too young for this sort of thing.

It makes me think about my few friends in high school who got eye brow rings and lip rings. “Spider bites” were big at the time. They ALL grew older and removed the piercings, some of which have not healed or closed. (Specifically, spider bites friend has two small holes in her bottom lip that she hates with a passion)

That being said, septum piercings can be removed and forgotten about. So I don’t think she will run into regrets. But I too was raised in a conservative home... and have this weird feeling of “just don’t let her do it!” Ya know? I feel my parenting style is/will be very similar to yours. So I feel some legit inner conflict. 

I think perhaps she should wait six months to a full year to think on it and have that time to know if she’s being impulsive. With big purchases my mom always made me wait a month or two, sometimes longer, to fully ponder if I still wanted that thing badly. Sometimes it was very effective in making me change my mind. Obviously, this isn’t the same as wanting a $700 bike or something but this might be the approach I’d take. She’d be settled in high school, and have plenty of time to fully think on the decision."

My 3 year old has a big speech delay that has gotten a lot of negative attention from some family and others. They always bring up autism 1: as if its some horrible thing and would be devastating and 2: as if they can just *sense* that he has it. 

Our SLP has laughed this off many times saying that her co workers would literally make fun of her for referring us to that department, given he doesn’t show any signs of autism. 

People think that they know what autism is, people think they just *know* these things because “the child isn’t developing within these specific parameters so they MUST be autistic!” But just listen to your doctors. No one else. 

And while having an autistic child presents certain obstacles that I’m not too terribly familiar with, I can’t imagine “preparing for the worst” or being ready to be devastated about it would help... anyone involved. Ya know? He’s still your little dude. He just *might* need specific types of help to grow up, soon. 

Stay positive, mama. And even if you get news you aren’t positive about, for his sake, keep on trying."
