femalefashionadvice,fr2t7s9,t3_gm0uj2,1589843431.0,"disappointment- urban outfitters- faux trendy items which are really just fast fashion with massive massive price tags for pretty much something of or below H&M quality... as a vintage lover I was annoyed about the huge premium on stuff you could find in any vintage shop for 5x cheaper 

redemption- IAMGIA- my favourite mid range brand. always unique and eye catching, worth the price for both quality and how ahead of trends they are. fav brand for streetwear- I always get stopped and asked where my clothing is from when I wear their pieces"
femalefashionadvice,fr1renp,t1_fr1jz0q,1589824662.0,this is such a shame. I have a beautiful ¬£180 maxi dress from free people and it‚Äôs super durable. my most beautiful timeless summer piece. maybe it varies by country but here in England I‚Äôve never been disappointed by any of my free people purchases

SkincareAddiction,fp0f1pt,t1_fp0aamy,1588208009.0,"thank you! I definitely have quite resistant skin, the opposite of sensitive. I might try n cut down to once a week with the glycolic scrub (it is physical but I only really move it on my skin when washing it off) and the toner 4/5 days then!! or should I just use the toner in the AM/PM instead of both? thanks :)"

I‚Äôm struggling to distinguish between dream and reality and when I get sad I completely lose control and hurt myself and can not control my actions and sadness.

depression,flxih5a,t1_flw163l,1585583535.0,this isn‚Äôt really helpful tbh it makes me feel extremely guilty and upset about having anxiety and depression. Just because things could be worse doesn‚Äôt mean you need to invalidate my struggles. and the whole world is in lockdown practically- we are in England too.
