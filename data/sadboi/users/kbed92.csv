ADHD,fctalcx,t3_eisllj,1577937377.0,"For paying attention in English or history class throughout high school—I really couldn’t do that as  I would just space out, but i could hyper focus myself on the words coming out of my teachers mouths. I would just write down word for word what they were saying and then come back to it later when I could digest it in my own time

For large tasks—I give myself one big reward at the end (something I reeeaaallly want to do or like) and then smaller rewards throughout the process. For example, I have to clean my whole house and make it spotless. I also have this restaurant I have been wanting to try...my end reward would be to eat at that restaurant. Throughout the process I would set myself little rewards for completing one portion of the task (so after one room is completely clean). I could have a piece of candy or sit down for 29/30 mins and go on my phone or watch tv. It does take self discipline to get started again after each little break, but that is what the end goal is there for as well. 

At work—write on sticky notes for my to-do list and put them on my monitor so as I work I am reminded of things I have to do as I work or as I renter my office. 

At work—take notes. I wish I were better at this, but it helps soooooo much

At work—if the day is particularly bad, I try to find a way to make my work interesting (looking at the task a different way, rethinking the path toward completion, etc). If it’s really bad then I may just go home depending on my meeting/work schedule. There is no point wasting my or other people’s time when I can’t stay on task for even five minutes. 

At work—I really like emails because I can go back and reference them to make sure I am accomplish what needs to be done. 

I could name a lot more, but what it really comes down to is experience. I learned how to deal with my adhd symptoms and to be successful despite all the emotional and concentration and physical symptoms. That was all because I wouldn’t give up. When I was younger I would start a task and fail and then start again having learned a little of what went wrong...repeating until I would succeed. Doing that time after time provides insight into what worked and what didn’t over the years. Then I can use that experience to help me be successful in life. 

In the end, you have to find what’s right for you through trial and error.  I was diagnosed really late too which means that I had to learn all these things on my own without meds.

A combination of coping techniques and meds seems to work the best for me."

Not that i actually wanted bipolar to be one of the things that was actually wrong with me, but the meds and hard work have really helped so I guess I’m greatful. 

Seriously, write the message, take a breath, and press send. What’s the worst that can happen?

bipolar,faxpwh4,t3_eaun38,1576387708.0,"I suggest talking to your psychiatrist about everything you have posted. They can answer your questions and concerns and help you figure out what else you are going through that perhaps hasn’t been addressed. Seriously, much better than a bunch of internet strangers giving you advice and their opinion (hypocrite cause I’m about to tell you about me below). 

As for my experience, I have had really bad mood swings my whole life with a whole host of other things. I have most definitely had short term things lead to those episodes, kind of like a roller coaster slowly going to the sky. I can usually get off that shit with better sleep (like non chemical induced sleep—which is not easy) eating right, and meditation or something that helps my anxiety. That and a mood stabilizer makes them less intense and uncomfortable like to where I can actually attempt to do the things I listed above. If it’s full blown though I lock myself in a room that is completely dark and try to sleep or have a dim light in and try to do something relaxing until it starts to subside. Usually they’re pretty quick so I guess I’m luck there. 

I went to see a psychiatrist this year and everything that I was feeling I told him and it went from multiple forms of anxiety with depression to that plus bipolar ii to all of that plus adhd. Seriously though, talk about this with your doctor.

ADHD,fawfoa6,t1_faweqd8,1576370497.0,Yeah things like setting rewards for yourself after you have completed a task are really helpful. If I have a particularly arduous task I will set one end reward I I really want to do for myself mixed with a couple little rewards throughout so I don’t lose to much focus in the middle. It takes some self restraint but the meds should help with that and especially with focus and being able to stay on task. Together they work well together so I get my task completed and I don’t kill my motivation and quit. Little things like that really help me get stuff done.
ADHD,faw2t5u,t1_favulzm,1576365169.0,Different meds and different dosages effect people differently. You shouldn’t be taking something that’s making you miserable. You should def talk to your doctor about this; you may just need a different dose or medication.

I told him the same analogy you said up there about trying on glasses for the first time. It really describes it perfectly—he thought so too lol. I understand the hyper focus. I can get derailed and focus on the wrong things so easily. I can’t believe he gave you no help and then is reprimanding you for figuring it out on your own (successfully at that). Seems weird to me. 

This is going to be pretty hypocritical of me cause I tend to way overthink things and ruin my days and perhaps my mood: take a breath and try to relax. Do something you really enjoy doing that can distract you a bit (this is what I do and usually makes me feel a bit better). What will happen Monday is decided and worrying is not going to change that. 

Additionally, if you get fired over something like that, then it wouldn’t have been great place to work anyway—and a terrible culture to cultivate growth in employees and have them reach their full potential. 

Lookie there. I wrote an easy too. :)

ADHD,faqhhmw,t1_faqepa8,1576303116.0,"Yeah it took me awhile to even get to the adhd. I went in for anxiety/depression. The lexapro he gave me pushed me into a manic episode. We got me stable and then we worked on the anxiety and depression. With the mood stabilizer I was able to take a small dose of sertraline which helped lift my mood and quiet my anxiety and panicking. Well after that I still had quite a few emotional issues not indicative of bipolar or anxiety and my concentration was horrible (fidgeting too). We talked and sine I had these issues since childhood he thought it may be adhd and prescribed me Adderall. After that it all came together. I started seeing him when I was 26 and now I’m halfway through 27 so it takes awhile—even longer for some, but getting there is worth. 

I’ve gone from extreme self loathing,thinking I’m worthless, crying most days, panic attacks at least twice a week and the other days feeling on the verge of it to manic plus all of those things to gradually getting stable (thank you lamictal) to stable but depressed and anxious and panicky to much less depressed with reduced anxiety to where I’m at now : stable, not depressed, anxiety in the best control I’ve ever had it (though I still have my days), content with myself and my life, and now, in control of my impulses, esp the emotional and focus ones (yay not feeling the need to over eat to feel like a human and yay for less clumsiness). 

I’ll get off my soapbox now. It takes time and usually quite a journey. And some hard work from you—none of my meds are cure all, and neither are most peoples. Have a little patience. You and your doctor may have to play around with does or even different meds to find the right one. Developing coping techniques and little tricks to make your life easier are also key. Together they work like a charm for me.

As a side point, I have never gotten anywhere by being dishonest with therapists and withholding symptoms of my mental issues or my meds. It’s awesome that you are gonna talk to your psychiatrist.

ADHD,f8d4tih,t3_e0b3th,1574478293.0,I use a pillbox and a reminder in my phone. I would more than likely forget to take them. It gets me into a habit which I am less likely to break even if I am questioning myself.
ADHD,f8d47hi,t3_e0b5n5,1574477782.0,"I honestly wish I was diagnosed as a kid and given medication because I was miserable, but that is beside the point. Since I wasn’t diagnosed I had to adapt my style of thinking and challenges that come with it to the environment around me. 

Taking challenging and interesting classes helped me stay focused—I took a couple non advanced classes in high school and I slept through the whole class because I could not focus, I could not bring myself to do homework, had to get up “to go to the bathroom” at least once a day, etc. 

I was really good at bullshitting—I could read a quick summary of the assigned reading and draw conclusions so that I could provide intelligent insight to the topics being discussed. 

Depending on the class I took very detailed notes, as in I wrote down everything the teacher said and wasn’t really comprehending anything. I would review them later when it was quiet and would start to put two and two together—if I had any questions then I would ask the next day or so—whenever I first saw them after reviewing my notes. 

And honestly I was able to get though because I was/am pretty smart. There was no class that I took that I couldn’t have gotten an A in if I was willing to put in the effort. It just so happened that in  A- to B+ range I had to do absolutely nothing. 

Tests were really hard as I had to go back and re read every question four times because I would lose focus in the middle of the sentence and not comprehend the rest. Your kid is diagnosed though, so you should be able to get them some accommodations though even if you don’t want him medicated. It would also be worth it to talk to his teachers and see if they can change their approach when working with him to see if a different style of teaching better suits him. Hope this helps.

Edited to make some sentences easier to understand and the formatting for the same reason."
ADHD,f80xhyd,t1_f801bq2,1574141447.0,YES! Every time I wash my hair I end up with a toupe worth of hair that comes out just by trying to detangle it...every damn time.
ADHD,f7pxd8e,t3_dxfv9z,1573955801.0,Congrats! So happy for you!!
ADHD,f7pi834,t3_dxeqjl,1573949691.0,I feel what you’re saying. Throughout my life I have had really bad emotional eating. My emotions s were up and down all the damn time which led to a lot of emotional eating and binging. Finally was diagnosed with adhd and the adderall has done the same. I feel like I have a normal persons appetite among a host of other things. I just feel right.
bipolar,f7pcjwx,t1_f7p7jwr,1573947486.0,"The fuck? That’s weird.  I said this in another post but it shocks what people say about their psychiatrists (only one side of the story, sure, but still). Idk, before I went to see my psychiatrist I did a shitload of research because if I was going to talk to someone about how I feel, they need to be good and kind and easy to talk to.  I need to trust them...As far as my diagnoses, my psychiatrist and I don’t really talk about about the names of the disorders except when I was first diagnosed. We mainly talk about how I am feeling and past and present issues, why I hate myself (or getting to hated yay), etc. He has to put a label though in order to prescribe something my insurance will pay for. Also I want to know; as far as the medication goes, that’s all him, but I would like to research the condition so I can find cbt, dbt, act, etc. techniques to do along with my medication (other than the standard eat healthy and exercise). It’s helped a lot."
bipolar,f7oznv9,t3_dx6x97,1573938396.0,"Just because it’s a listed side effect doesn’t mean that it can’t be a cause for concern. If it were me I would ask, but that’s just me. Good luck!"
bipolar,f7owuv9,t1_f7ocg51,1573936357.0,Why do you think that? Cause it has a stigma attached to it?
bipolar,f7nvkyf,t1_f7ns98a,1573916027.0,"Exactly. Whatever works for you is good. I am not willing to take lithium for fear of the side effects and interference with other medications and dehydration, etc...just as you are not willing to take antidepressants even with a mood stabilizer for fear of a mood episode. It does seem like lithium helping anxiety issues is the exception to the rule. The thing that has actually done the best for my anxiety has been adderall—I was recently diagnosed with adhd (god it would have made my life so much better if I knew that as a kid). Anyway, good luck with the lithium; I wish you the best (and stability!)."
bipolar,f7nstlm,t3_dx23s0,1573914483.0,This is so great. I watched the video yesterday and that is some of the craziest shit I have ever seen in a football game. My favorite was the Steelers player who kicked Garrett when he was down and got a one game suspension. Bullshit—was defending his teammate.

bipolar,f7nrxo7,t1_f7n8jwh,1573913977.0,Oof the glassware in a chemistry lab. You would have hated my clumsy ass. Thank god I never have to step in a chemistry lab ever again—college was enough.
bipolar,f7nqx8k,t3_dx5h1z,1573913408.0,"For bipolar 2 you have to have a hypomanic and depressive episode to meet the criteria. For bipolar 1 you just have to have one manic episode, but depression usually comes with it. There are other types like cyclothymia and bipolar not otherwise specified. Your old psychiatrist sounds like an idiot. I would recommend go seeing another one and taking about your concerns from the previous psychiatrist, what y’all talked about, your hospital visit, your current and past symptoms, etc. Idk if you have the money to pay for it but med circle has a really good video on bipolar disorder; they actually have great videos on mental health disorders and personal stories. I think they have a YouTube for free that has scaled down versions of the episodes."
bipolar,f7nonx8,t3_dx6x97,1573912058.0,Have you talked to your psychiatrist about this? Sounds concerning.
ADHD,f7nngqp,t3_dx51t7,1573911192.0,"Welcome to my childhood. Its gotten better in the recent half year or so, but for 26 years? It was exhausting for me. The high you felt while immersed/obsessed with this one thing and the sadness/emptiness when you were forced to move on/became uninterested ."
ADHD,f7nmqfa,t3_dx64e7,1573910599.0,I have noticed this too. I have gotten in the habit of drinking at least three large (like two water bottle size) glasses while im at work. I just sip on them throughout the day. By the time I get home I also try to do a couple since I am a lot thirstier.
bipolar,f7ng3mm,t1_f7nec10,1573901520.0,"Yeah well so does lamictal. Also, can lithium help reduce crippling anxiety? No, not really. Plus I would rather give the sertraline a chance than deal with the side effects of lithium, the possibility of lithium toxicity, and the need for constant blood testing—that sounds miserable to me. We’ll see. My psychiatrist is amazing and he suggested this with an extremely low dose at that with lamictal—I trust him 100%. He is also aware that antidepressants can cause mania, which is why I got off the lexapro so fast."
bipolar,f7ndj4h,t1_f7msil1,1573897185.0,"I agree with this to some extent. Antidepressants ALONE are dangerous. Lexapro induced this angry and crazy hypomania that I never wish to feel again. I was bouncing off the walls, can’t think, can’t sleep, can’t focus, extremely unhappy and angry recluse. There are some people who can take only antidepressants to help, but that is the exception. Now, low doses of antidepressants with a mood stabilizer can really help the depression that comes with bipolar and/or comorbid anxiety (GAD and Panic Disorder for me). I did a lot of research before I tried another SSRI (sertraline) with lamictal. I recognize there are good and bad experiences, but it is quite common for people with bipolar disorder to take antidepressants with a mood stabilizer. Obviously they haven’t worked for you but in conjunction with something else they can be useful."
bipolar,f7ncz1u,t1_f7n6hxx,1573896259.0,"I take sertraline too. The lexapro induced mania, so I tried lamictal. It really helped stabilize me but I was still sad and extremely anxious, so I talked with my doctor (who is amazing might I add) and he suggested going on a ssri where you could start at a super low dose and increase little by little. It and finally being diagnosed with adhd that I have had my whole life have been absolute game changers."
bipolar,f7ncg6x,t1_f7msi2f,1573895384.0,"I went crazy after about a week. Talked to my doctor and tapered of it right away. Started lamictal but was still down after an while and my anxiety was through the roof. Tried a super low dose of sertraline with the lamictal and it’s been working pretty well. I had an adjustment period where I would feel myself going up, but i could also feel the lamictal working cause I would start coming down a day or so later. Now they both work in harmony. It’s nice not to have excruciating anxiety and mild depression."
bipolar,f7nc7x7,t1_f7lakjj,1573895002.0,Same. Not even if antidepressants. I take sertraline with lamictal and it’s has helped a lot (not to mention the adderall for my previously undiagnosed adhd). I feel like a different person.
BipolarReddit,f7j45pe,t1_f7hxgvs,1573770345.0,That’s crazy. I don’t see why your psychiatrist would put you on ssri monotherapy if you have bipolar. I started with lamictal. It was great for a little bit esp while we were increasing my dose but 200mg is the max recommended dose for bipolar (obviously every case is different). Felt okay for a little bit then the sadness and apathy started creeping back in and more importantly my anxiety skyrocketed so we tried the lamictal with Zoloft actually and it didn’t induce mania (cause the lamictal is a mood stabilizer).
BipolarReddit,f7hwec5,t1_f7htxqp,1573748698.0,Lamictal is more effective for suppressing downs. But it has been more of the ups for me. I had to take an antidepressant with it to help the downs. Previously I wasn’t able to take them cause I would go manic. With lamictal I can take both and not be manic.
Showerthoughts,f7e9ppy,t1_f7e7c6i,1573651606.0,Yeah well I did the same and didn’t get shit.
ADHD,f7d0wci,t3_dvg5pl,1573604765.0,I know the feeling. On of my coworkers knows I have adhd and that I take adderall and he has joked before about me sliding him one when he needs to concentrate. He then said that he’ll just go to our other coworker and get some from her. He was joking but it still made me uncomfortable. One of the many reasons I keep it in a lockbox in my work bag.
ADHD,f7d0ig4,t3_dvii89,1573604490.0,"I guess as need would be like if you are at work and you absolutely cannot focus or fidgeting is out of control, if you need to be seated and pay attention for long periods of times but you can’t do that...idk, I take it everyday and it has helped tremendously. You just have to find the right dose that relieves the symptoms but you don’t get a euphoric feeling from. It’s not a cure all (at least for me), but it clears my head so that I can focus; it calms my fidgeting, increases my attention span, my patience level, and desire to organize my house and life, and decreases my temper, my appetite (to that of a normal person), anxiety, and my daydreaming and zoning out (thankfully to almost nothing). I still have the symptoms, it’s just wayyyyyyy more manageable."
ADHD,f7aam6p,t1_f7a841z,1573524628.0,"Yeah it took a while to get where I’m at. A lot of yo yoing. Went from lexapro to mania—got off that shit real fast. Then to lamictal and trying to find the right dosage. Did and it leveled me out...but like at a mild depressed state. Was really happy with the stability but still down in life. Did that for a while and then added in sertraline which kinda sent me up, but the lamictal did it’s job and would knock me down after a day or two—now they’re working in sync together. I think after getting my head mostly straight the adhd came full force cause there wasn’t really anything else to dilute it. Talked about my inability to focus and fidgeting and some of the ways I acted as a child—was able to try Adderall and it was like the missing piece. Still took a while and a lot of patience. There were many times where I felt disheartened and all over the place but I got there. It’s all about “finding the right cocktail.” I hope you are able to find stability—and soon!"
ADHD,f7a9x3r,t3_duwzw5,1573524131.0,"I now can too! I was able to read Harry Potter growing up, bit that I’d because I was in love with the series. Even then it was hard cause I had to go back and keep rereading cause I stopped paying attention and just went on auto pilot. I haven’t really been interested in reading that much cause nothing else gripped my attention and it was too hard to stay focused. It’s amazing how something like Adderall can completely change that and make it so I can make it through a long article without having to go back and read it."

Some related questions to think about:  
\- What choices have you made and did you consider your ADHD with those choices?

I was just diagnosed recently so no. 


\- If you're diagnosed after career making career choices, would you say knowing that if you would have known that you had you had ADHD at the moment of past choices, this would have influenced your choices?

No

\- Do you believe that doing something you like is (for you) enough to not have to consider having ADHD?

Yes

\- How do you feel about the following statement: ""Having ADHD makes me understand the hardships that other people go through and empathize (or sympathize) with what they’re going through (bipolar and anxiety too)

\- How do you feel about the following statement: ""Having ADHD doesn't influence my activities, performance or anything related to my job's daily activities at all""

Not really, no. I do think it was making me miserable because it was taking me much longer to complete things...but my quality of work never suffered (just me cause I was coming in early and staying late). 

\- What do you think about the following: ""Don't think too much about your ADHD, just go with your gut feeling.""

Why not?

\- What career choices have you made that, when thinking about it, actually seems to be not a smart choice for people with ADHD on paper, but for you turned out to be a very good choice for you and what made so?

Pushing hard to go from working outside to working behind a desk and writing reports. Turns out I’m pretty good (and time efficient) when I am not going into la la land for 10 minutes or more every hour. 

\- Which are the most common ADHD-symptoms/-problems you encounter during your daily activities?

Daydreaming, fidgeting, inability to sit still/pay attention, lack of patience, etc. 

\- Do you feel that you are missing out on something, or can't do something you would like to do, because of your ADHD?

Yes, before I was medicated. Now, no. 

\- Did you decide not to do something you wanted to do, where interested in, or would like to do because of your ADHD?

No

\- Upon choosing your career, or during your career, did you make choices out of interest, because you wanted to earn different or because you needed to? (needed would be: closer to home because you became a parent, or you where fired and so on)

Interest

\- How does the following statement relate to you: ""I made changes in my career, because i just wanted to do something different""

Yes."
ADHD,f7a7x6q,t1_f7a7gmw,1573522685.0,"Yeah I take lamictal, sertraline, and Adderall and I haven’t had any symptoms for each. I guess I’m lucky though—some people can’t take one let alone all three.  It has helped massively. I feel like I have found the missing puzzle pieces and it’s so relieving. Anyway it has worked great for me. 😃"
ADHD,f76nab2,t1_f76mv4i,1573430824.0,"If it makes you feel any better I wish my parents had taken me to see someone when I was little. It would have saved me a lot of heartache and confusion as to why am I like this. Why can’t I just be normal? What is wrong with me, and so on."
ADHD,f6yw70c,t3_dttqg8,1573300903.0,"You don’t have to feel ashamed. I don’t know where you are, but in my area in America, adhd has some of the lowest stigma compared to other illnesses. I don’t mean this to invalidate it, just to let you know that you don’t have to feel ashamed about talking about it. I try and talk about all the shit that’s wrong with me to the people around me so that they can see that this shit happens to all kinds of people even ones that appear “normal.” The bipolar one is harder though. I try not to feel embarrassed about that too, but I do and Sometimes I just refer to it as depression. Anyway, long story short, don’t be afraid to tell people you have adhd. It will only help you. If they know your teachers can work to come up with a plan or teaching style that works for you. Also, fuck what other people think. You are trying to better you and part of that is being able to learn and enjoy school."
