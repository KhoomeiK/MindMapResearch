He called me aphrodite with insecurity issues and told me it makes no sense that I am insecure because I am ""the shit"" (his words). Anyway, I really listened and I got to work soothing my anxiety and insecurities by doing yoga, eating better, not allowing myself to even think about things that make me anxious and that I can't change, and making sure that I have plenty of me time and time with my friends. 

It's been only 2 months since I started taking it seriously and I am so much happier and so much closer to my friends,  family, and partner.  Changing how you attach and relate to people is something that can be changed! It just takes changing how you live your life."
