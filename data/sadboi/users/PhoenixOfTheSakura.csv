NintendoSwitch,forxiw0,t3_g8ynp4,1588020248.0,"*Wi-Fi issues, error code: 2110-2004*

Hello everyone,


As of today I have an issue with my switch. It refuses to connect with my wifi while my boyfriend‚Äôs switch (and every other device that needs wifi) connects perfectly to the wifi. I keep receiving error code 2110-2004. I have tried so many things to fix the issue, but nothing seems to be working...


So far I‚Äôve tried:
- checking if the password is correct;
- resetting my switch;
- resetting my router;
- moving closer to the router;
- copied the exact information about my wifi (like the IP adress and DNS) that my boyfriend‚Äôs switch has;
- removing metal objects or things that might cause interference;
- added the wifi manually.


Do any of you guys have any helpful insights on this?


Thank you in advance!"
