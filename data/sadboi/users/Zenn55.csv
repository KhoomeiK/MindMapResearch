mentalillness,fpuxwao,t3_gfk1kc,1588927617.0,"My BPD basically painted a portion of my personality. When I was getting better, I had the same feeling that I missed being the person who cared too much and got mad at simple and little things. It's as if it was already a part of me, but I know to myself that the version of me who was engulfed in the nightmares of BPD is not someone I want to go back to. Even though I'm still managing my symptoms until now, there's a part of me that wants to let it all out. There's a built up anger and fear inside of me that is turning into the anxiety I have right now. However, if I let myself get angry, my BPD will eventually come back. I'm fighting my anxiety and fears of abandonment in order to cast out the remnants of my previous self. 

What I was before was not healthy. I pushed everyone away in the fear I would grow attached to them and then in the end, they would abandon me. But that wasn't right. That type of thinking is what caused me to loose things and people I never would've lost. It caused me to develop several forms of anxiety that at some point in my life, I just wanted to end it all. I don't want to go back to that type of thinking. And yet, a part of me misses that feelingâ€” the pain and heavy feeling in your chest that never seems to go away... And how I got used to it. It's contradicting, but I guess that's the way it is."

mentalillness,fpmgv1a,t3_gdyrnf,1588732790.0,"There's no reason to pass the pain to others. You're precious and your life is worth living. The future holds more than what you can expect. Even if you think no one cares about you, there will always be that one person who seems to be different from other people you know. You just have to find them. You are the world to them, and if you die, your fears, sadness, and depression will be passed to them. This is just a part in life where everything seems so downhill that you just want to end it all. Believe me, I know what you feel. I have been diagnosed with 6 different Anxiety Disorders and there was a time that I almost committed to it. I've been fighting for decades and the loneliness is just dreadful. But the more you think about it, life is too precious to give up. There are other people who will care more for you than the people you expected it from. You will meet them, and your life will slowly and surely, be completed. You won't even realize it until you see yourself smiling with a bunch of people you just met.

Your life is not a curse nor a prison. 
It is more precious than what you thought of it. There is no reason for people to hate you, but there is a hundred reason for them to love you. Sometimes we all do some stupid stuff... but that's part of life. If they judge you, shrug it off. If they reject you, then accept yourself. 
If the loneliness is taking over, make some friends in the internet. 

All of the lives that died from this spreading disease WANTED to live. They wanted to enjoy the sadness and happiness, the laughs and experiences. They wanted to live a normal life, even if it isn't a perfect one. This maybe a bit weird to say but don't take in a bad way... 
Don't waste a life that these people wanted SO BADLY to have. You have so much to live for, so much to look forward to. Please, don't be the opposite. Sorrow is what makes happiness worth it. They give each other meaning. Fight the sorrow and embrace happiness. Embrace your life and reject death when you still have your chances."
MentalHealthPH,fp8buqx,t3_gbt91t,1588388446.0,"Pareho tayo ng sitwasyon. Wala ako halos makausap. Pero ok lng sa akin. Pero always keep in mind, self harm is never the answer. Ako na lumalaban sa mga anxiety disorders ko ng 6 years, nararamdaman kita. Dumaan rin ako sa ganyan. Pero hindi yan ang sagot sa kalungkutan na nararamdaman mo. Maraming bagay ang pwede mo gawin habang hinihintay matapos ang lockdown. Yoga, maglaro, etc. 
Mahaba ang buhay. Habang tumatagal, mas natatanto natin na napakasarap mabuhay. Isang beses lang ito, wag nating sayangin. Oo, pinapalala ng lockdown ang mga nararamdaman natin, pero huwag tayong magpatalo sa depression at kalungkutan na tanging hangad lang ay sirain ang buhay natin.
Lumalaban ang mga covid patients, ang mga sundalo, ang mga health workers, pati rin tayo. Hindi ako nagpapatalo kahit sirain man ako ng aking sariling isipan. Huwag ka rin magpatalo sa mga suicidal thoughts na magdudulot lng ng lungkot sayo at sa ibang tao.

Your neck isn't a shirt, so don't hang it.
Your skin isn't paper, so don't cut it.
Your heart isn't a door, so don't lock it.
Your life isn't a film, so don't end it.

Copy paste man toh, pero totoo naman. Huwag mo saktan sarili mo kasi di ka naman isang bagay na dapat saktan. Alagaan mo na sarili mo ah. Set a proper schedule, get some rest and sleep, eat healthy and watch anime or smthing. Lumaban ka, at huwag kang susuko.
Maraming nagmamahal sayo <3"

mentalillness,fp0ms94,t3_gam35k,1588212433.0,"You may have Harm OCD (You need a proper diagnosis though). Most people who suffer from Harm OCD won't actually do it (since they have a conscience) but there's still a chance they might actually commit. Proper treatment is needed if it gets to the point it bothers you for hours or even days. Exposure therapy will be done when you are ready. Just remember these are only intrusive thoughts that invades your mind. I have it and it doesn't bother that much at all ever since I overcame it.

Most people brush off these thoughts. If it keeps invading your mind then you should get help. Don't seek reassurance from other people, it will only provide a short period of relief and make it even worse. Just know you're not alone, and don't get sucked up by it. ;)"
mentalillness,fozyu0b,t1_foyiia7,1588199317.0,"Hopefully it gets settled. If it gets worse during quarantine and you get suicidal thoughts, know that you are worth it and whatever you think of yourself, you still belong in this world. There are times that you may feel abandoned and hopeless but it's just your mind tricking you to think that. It can get exhausting but you're strong. Try not to overexpress your emotions (like I did) cuz it can get ugly. Know that you're not alone.

Hopefully you get a proper diagnosis and it's not BPD. I suffered so much to the brink of having my social life almost ruined."
mentalillness,foxbqzi,t3_g9xbsm,1588139285.0,"I didn't understand why I would go crazy mad over simple things. I would get mad at my friends and family just because something wasn't right, and I had frequent panic attacks, mood swings, and anxiety about being abandoned. I would do reckless things, have suicidal thoughts, and even think that my friends and family don't care for me at all. It was as if I didn't exist. All of my friendships seem to not last that long and I would often beg for forgiveness. There was a time that I thought of myself as being the most horrible person in the planet, that I should not have existed at the first place. 

Last year I got help and it was actually BPD. I've been managing well, and it was a good thing that it was caught early before it shifted into worse. Getting help really does good to a person. All of my friends accepted me for who I am. I'm lucky to have them."

Your organs and body is in a lot of stress and you're like a ticking time bomb. It's been 2 hours, hopefully you didn't black out and got to the hospital. I'm praying for your health and safety. . ."
mentalillness,foai2w5,t1_foafv0h,1587646918.0,"The last paragraph was a note for everyone btw. Sorry it kinda pointed on you xD. But yes, the people I see who post that they are depressed on insta without a solidified reason is quite annoying. They don't really need a full reason to feel empty or depressed but if they are going to put depression as something you could get easily, then that is how the misconception of depression is born. They're more fake than the celebrities who actually suffer from it. A celebrity can smile in the media and become a model for everyone to look forward to, but that is one of the reasons why their life is becoming meaningless and dull. They've become a model in which every little mistake, they are judged. To smile and to act as if everything is fine, because that is the professional way. These people in insta are more sensitive than the people who fake a smile to continue living the life they thought they could enjoy. If they really are depressed, they shouldn't put it in an over expressive way.

Sorry I kinda went a bit overboard xD."
mentalillness,fo9tidz,t3_g68u9q,1587630616.0,"I agree very much. As someone who is actually depressed and is diagnosed with a number of anxiety disorders, depression is not something to joke about nor force yourself to have. I had suicidal thoughts and episodes of crying, panic attack and mental breakdown... They're not something you would want to have. I pity the people who trend on this just because they want to feel cared or special. If they want to feel that way, don't ruin the image of depression. We're not like this because we want it, we're like this because we've been through a lot that it hurts too much to handle. Everybody is unique and special, they don't need to join us just because it's a trend. We want to escape this living hell, don't force yourself into it. 

However, if someone is brave enough open up and to share that they are depressed to you, please understand them. It's not everyday that someone is willing to share their pain with you. That means they need comfort and someone to consult to. Some people who suffer from it are more open to their close friend than their family or therapist. It's just how it works. Just please, understand and respect it. You don't want a person in your life to disappear and be guilty because you chose to be ignorant about it. This is a note to everybody. As humans, we are designed to feel sadness and happiness. We don't need a reason to feel both emotions. We're human beings."

MentalHealthPH,fo10qek,t3_g4rali,1587423436.0,Sounds like an episode of psychosis. It's recommended that you have yourself checked out and tell your parents about it. It's important that you also check yourself of other noticeable symptoms and tell it to your psychiatrist.
braintumor,fnylcka,t1_fnxd38r,1587366714.0,"Im experiencing similar things. Whenever I bend over, I experience pressure from my forehead that extends to the bridge of my nose and to the top of my head. I have pain in some parts of my neck and sometimes at the back. Everyday I have a dull headache that mostly dominates the left side of my head. 
I feel dizzy and nauseous sometimes. I don't have a nasal congestion. I can feel the headaches in the morning but they are not that severe. Just mild migraines that mainly affect my left side. They're staying about the same but I can't notice if they're becoming worst. Whenever I eat I get dizzy. I have a foggy head everyday and it's hard to concentrate.. It's difficult to pinpoint if I should be alarmed by my symptoms since I also suffer from Anxiety and Depression, which are also factors I need to manage. Im just asking if what I'm feeling is similar to what you felt. I'm trying finding out if some of my symptoms are a red flag I need to act on. I don't want to go to the doctor at this situation and then find out it was just my body's reaction to stress xD."
