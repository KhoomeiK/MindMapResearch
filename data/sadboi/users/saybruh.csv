You can’t make people care and changing our entire government/society is a lot more difficult than working within the system we have. It’s easy to look at the shit we have to deal with and feel defeated but working within the parameters we have to get closer to our goals is significantly easier (although still difficult). It’s easy to just say fuck it and wrap yourself in the red and black but its not a path to real change (just yet) and really only puts you on a path to constantly being unsatisfied and feeling defeated. Slow change is how you make things good for a long time.

Adding VG probably would make it less likely to crystallize but you'd also be diluting the e-liquid so your dosage would be lower.

 check out some of the carts they have already filled? I haven't tried them (i smoke flower) but I'm looking into the vapes because my cough has been coming back (I vape but not cbd).
