Star_Trek,fr6dq0i,t1_fr3qwnr,1589924403.0,"The OP isn't banned. Banned users can't post. Period. OP is posting but the content is removed by a moderator. Probably it is an automatic procedure by the automoderator.

My hypotheses are the following;

1) The OP is using a word or a combination of words that the automoderator finds and trigger the removal of the OP. For example the [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science\)) ""STD"" is recognized by the automoderator and it removes the post. ""Star Trek Discovery sucks"" can be another more complicated such string.

2) The automoderator recognizes the OP and removes whatever they post. In other words, the automoderator sees that /u/Such-Victory makes a post and the post is removed regardless its content.

Furthermore, the automoderator may even automatically decide who will get into a list with the users that will be treated as such. It has been public knowledge that the mods of the other sub are banning people who have positive karma at specific subs. You can program a bot (e.g. the automoderator) to ""scan"" each user and see if they have positive karma at specific communities. For example, having positive karma here will result at being included into such a list. I'll say again that this is public knowledge, the mods of the other sub have admitted that much themselves. Which communities they aim at with that policy, is something they know. In case this isn't clear, let me bring another example. A bot (most likely the automoderator) will ""scan"" every /r/Star_Trek's subscriber to find out their karma at /r/the_donald. Having positive karma may lead to the automoderator banning you.

Shadowbanning works in a similar way. Although a user is not technically banned and they can make an OP, their OP is not showing at anyone's feed. Before getting banned at the other sub I must had been shadow-bannned. I had made an OP, completely unrelated to nuTrek, and it got no traction whatsoever. Not a single comment, not a single vote.

Star_Trek,fr6c8ht,t3_gmq4q2,1589923652.0,"> ~~Assumption:~~ Plot Twist: they’re telling the truth. 

There is no plot twist.

My first and foremost problem with the Pike show is that the producers said after STD S2;

> We sent Discovery into the future cause we want to free ourselves from the canon that is hindering us.

Then, they decide to revisit the exact time period that **they** admitted after 2 years that was impossible to work with!

In other words, they are either completely dumb or insincere and I don't intend to stick around to find which.

> An episodic show will be harder to screw up 

Do you really believe that it will be episodic? Sure, they promise that. I have a question; When did they keep their promises? Never!

Now think about it. Where will the Pike show air? CBS? No! CBS All Access. A streaming service. Streaming services prefer series that are arc-focused. Open air TV (e.g. CBS) prefer episodic series. At best we will get the X-Files/DS9 paradigm, at which there is a main arc and there are ""episodes of the week"" as well. I doubt we will get that though. You know why? Cause the X-files and DS9 had ~20+ episodes per season. Streaming services' TV series have ~10. You can't do both with 10 episodes per season!

I am telling you. Have no hope! Just move on with your lives and if you don't want to do so, just re-watch the old series. This is what I am gonna do."

More importantly and jokes aside, Brooks' comments (even if we assume that the ""absent black father"" comment is true), are not contradictory.

Brooks at the panel I linked said two things;

a) ""You can't play a color"".

This however should not be understood as ""you can't try to play a color"". Cause you know, we see production teams creating tokens (racial or otherwise) all the time. The point he made was that it is impossible to ""play a color"", as such, when someone will try they will fail. This is in line with nuTrek's obsession of creating tokens, which in the end create the exact opposite connotations.

For example, PIC tried to tell a story in favor of the refugees, but as I had said many weeks ago and as Red Letter Media put it very recently  ""I am learning to become a racist by watching this show! Thanks Alex Kurtzman!""

It is like saying ""don't try to play a color, you can't play a color. It is impossible, you will fail and you will create the opposite connotations"". 

b) In that light Brooks said that he didn't play Sisko as ""the black captain"". He didn't approach Sisko as the ""black captain"".

Then, assuming that the ""absent black father"" quote is true (and I believe it **exactly** because it is **in line** with the rest) Brooks adds that he didn't like the finale cause it had those ""black person"" connotations. Sisko was no longer a captain that just happened to be black. Since Sisko left Yates pregnant with his child for never to come back, Sisko became ""the black captain"" and on top of that the ""absent black father"" trope was added as well.

See? Not only Brooks' statements are not contradictory, they are 100% in agreement! And frankly, I agree with him too.

I wanted Sisko to leave the corporeal plane forever, that was his last sacrifice as a hero. Which means that since that part was the good part, the writers all they had to do was to just not to have Yates being pregnant. And in case you are wondering about Jake, Jake by that point was a legal adult and Sisko had acknowledged him ""as a man"". 

Unfortunately, the writers went either for an overkill  dramatically or they were planning an 8th season (that at times I have heard some of the writers wanted), which would have resulted at Sisko's return? Anyhow, as afar as I am concerned this was just an honest mistake from the part of the writers and the producers, which seems that Brooks acknowledges as such, which is why he put his disagreement very mildly."

Rotten Tomatoes has a poll called ""[The Ultimate Summer Movie Showdown](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/summer-movie-showdown/)"". Among the movies there is Revenge of the Sith. /r/prequelmemes caught wind of it and we went en masse and voted RotS. RotS in the previous round was pitted against ""Endgame"". RotS won. Additionally all Star Wars movies of the previous round won and now there are 4 Star Wars movies against 4 non Star Wars movies. This lead to the creation of memes in here.

At the time of this writing the 3 original trilogy movies are winning, but RotS is losing to ""Dark Knight Rises"". [Last night (Greece time) all the Star Wars movies were winning by a wide margin](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/comments/gm0twb/brave_but_foolish/fr240nv/). Now RotS is losing and the 3 OT movies are winning with a small margin. Judging from this OP and some comments I have seen, other sites (4chan, Rotten Tomatoes etc) are trying to go against the Star Wars movies and/or RotS specifically. 

Lastly, judging from the difference in votes cast in each poll, [I'd agree](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/comments/gmpkzb/we_need_this_to_happen_for_the_republic/fr61kwu/) with /u/landofthebeez that bots have been utilized against RotS.

4) RotS vs Dark Knight Rises (33% - 67%)

So, let's get down to it, shall we? Hit it Mary!

1) At ~01:38 Mr Plinkett reminds us what we were promised for ""Picard"". Now, did we get what was promised to us? HELL NO! So, keep that disappointment in mind when you read or hear any promises about any other ""utopic"" Star Trek. Yes, Pike, I am looking at you! 🖕

2) Those things at 05:34 were told unironically?!! LOL ΌΧΙ ΡΕ ΜΑΛΑΚΑ! **ΟΧΙ ΡΕ ΜΑΛΑΚΑ!!** LOL

3) I disagree with Plinkett. The actress that plays the Twin Girl Destroyers is not that bad. You know who is the worst actress on the planet Earth? Sonequa Martin-Green that is who is the worst actress in the entire world. Probably the entire solar system. I don't know about the galaxy though, I'll give her that much. [I have seen better acting in every single porn movie that I have seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRs0OqV4uSc). And yes,  I mean that literally!

By the by, do you know who is the second worst actress in the world? Allison Pill! LOL. Just remembering her facial expression when she wasn't taking this seriously and she was trying to hide that laugh of hers, makes me laugh!

4) When people were saying that Seven was now a cold blooded murderer, I was thinking that they were exaggerating. I am sorry, OK? I am so sorry. You were 100%  right, no exaggeration, no nothing.

That is something, right?

NO IT ISN'T! I can't believe that PIC could disappoint me even more after all those weeks! How is that even possible?! How is it even possible to make something worse than STD!! I can't process that!

Which brings us to;

5)  Are gays psychopaths? Well, no they aren't. Seven isn't a psychopath. She is a cold blooded killer though. So....gays are a bunch of vigilante killers now?? Is this the message of the show?

OMFG, but I thought that PIC was so friendly to the LGBT community cause Seven and that Space Junkie touched hands!

Well, at least we agree at something with Plinkett. Now we hate everyone who is different than us. Thanks for opening my eyes nuTrek. As a lifelong Trek fan I always welcomed those who were different than me. I supported diversity. Now though I know that those who are not like me, like the Klingons, they want to destroy me and eat me. And it isn't just the Klingons. The Romulans destroyed a fleet that was meant to save them, killed thousands at the Utopia Planetia shipyards and burned the atmosphere of Mars. That little schoolgirl from the short Trek? THOSE ANIMALS KILLED HER! And don't get me started with the ~~androids~~ synths. They want to wipe every organic lifeform on the galaxy. We need to strike first before they send Space Robo Cthulhu on us! 

Those fucking refugees that are showing up on our (Greek) shores? BURN THEM. KILL THEM! They don't want to destroy our way of life, they want to kill us. They worship another God than me, that is basically the real Cthulhu! THEY MUST BE STOPPED! 

wait.....what?! I think that nuTrek turned me into a right wing asshole!

(/sarcasm of course, if you couldn't tell)

And that is the most important part of it all. As Plinkett put it;

> I am learning to become a racist by watching this show! Thanks Alexx Kurtzman.

6) I almost choked myself on what I was eating, when Plinkett called Riker ""a total slut""

7) Wait.....wait......wait......wait.....wait.....what?! 

Vulcan with Sunglasses has an elaborate plan to locate the Synth Planet, the plan works to a degree and calls her Romulan Fleet (that wasn't used to relocate Romulans!) in order to destroy the synths. In the meantime the synths are about to call Space Robo Cthulhu to destroy all organic life on the galaxy or whatever, which means she is right and her life's work is right in front of her. Furthermore she is all there is that stands against the galaxy being destroyed. 

Basically she is the hero now and she can say to Riker;

> hey idiot I have always been right, let's save the galaxy together, let's kill the synths and Space Robo Cthulhu. After that I will have completed my life's work and I will gladly surrender to you.

But what does she do instead? SHE RUNS!! WHY?! Her life's work is right in front of her. She is the hero, she is all that stands against galactic destruction. At the very least she should have taken her chances, try to convince Riker and if she were to fail she would have fought him. She wouldn't have to win the battle either. She could have just have the other ships cover her and she could make a suicide run against the synth colony and destroy it. All Star Trek ships are basically running at some sort of a power source that it is so powerful that if they would crush it would cause an explosion that could be like the Tsar Bomb. Hell, her ship has a micro black hole as a power source. I bet she could have her engineers unleash that and have the black hole eat the entire solar system they are at, including the synth planet and Space Robo Cthulhu and Riker's fleet. She would have been the hero we needed but do not deserve because we never believed her and we made fun of her because of her large pointy ears and ridiculous sunglasses! 

But she just says ""fuck my life's work"" and leaves! No copy/paste space battle either! I suppose they run that much out of money!!

In other words the execution. Sure, as I said, I will agree with you that the Prophets plotline was sub-par at the execution part.

>  If it were modern times I would prefer something like today's modern Darmok: Arrival.

I didn't like that movie. I expected more from that movie. Maybe I didn't like it because I had high expectations. As my /r/freefolk flair states ""you can't get disappointed if you have no expectations"", which means that the opposite is true as well.

> That movie, as far as communication with the aliens, did that concept better than anything I've seen to date. It made the aliens feel alien, and communication itself feel alien, and even the concept of time and linearity came into question in a believable way.

This is where I disagree. I felt that the execution was bad because the aliens were being taught how to communicate with the humans most of the times and not vice versa. To a significant degree it was the human protagonists that were leading the whole learning process, which I found very wrong. Especially since these aliens supposedly wanted something from humanity and they planned that first contact. Logic dictates that they should have studied us first, learn our language(s), they would have been able to communicate with us in our language(s) and they would have been the ones teaching us their language, because they had the agenda they had.

> Anyway, maybe if they had planned the dominion early on (like when they were developing the show) this could have been fleshed out in a way that made more sense

Now I am confused. What the Dominion has anything to do with it. I thought we were talking about the Prophets here.

Furthermore, both the Prophets and the Dominion were planned from the beginning. Not in the sense ""we have figured out everything"", cause this was the 90s, but they knew that there were the Prophets, what they were more or less and they intended at bringing the Dominion into the fold as well, in the manner I explained to you.

Star_Trek,fr1b02z,t1_fr15jc1,1589816544.0,"In regards to the ""Sacrifice of Angels"", I will agree with you at the execution part. Actually, I think that the producers agree with you. It has been more than a decade since I have seen that interview, but if memory serves me right they admit that their execution may have not been as great.

I will however disagree with you about the necessity of the Prophets' plotline(s). And I am an atheist and I was a militant atheist at that. Actually maybe for that reason I am leaning towards of giving that plotline a pass. I don't know.

Anyhow, sure, it had its many weak moments at the execution part, but I think that their inclusion was crucial. The Prophets were mirroring and balancing the Founders if you come to think about it. So, without the Prophets, the Founders would have been....unbalanced. Interestingly, from the aforementioned interviews at the DS9 DVDs, I have gathered that the Founders were not meant to be ""gods"" from the beginning. Initially the Dominion would have been an ""anti-UFP"". Something down the lines of nuTrek's UFP. An UFP that somewhere down the line something went wrong and now they are  a bunch of xenophobes or whatever. If you ask me that idea would have been much more interesting, but the writers deviated from that path of theirs as they were implementing ""the Dominion"". In the end, and always per those interviews I have seen, they decided to try numerous species in order to see which one is a success and which is not. Admirably in the end all of them were a success! The Vorta, the Jem'hadar and the Founders, they all succeeded! That success however lead at no more species to be included, meaning further deviation from that initial ""anti-UFP"" concept. In the current concept it became almost a necessity for the Founders to be seen as Gods and that mirrored with the other ""god""-race of the series, the Prophets. Although this was not their intention, the writers managed to create that connotation and any further connotations that stem from that initial connotation. Which speaks volumes for their ability to write and plan ahead. Cause many times, when you are a good writer, you create something that has such depth, that you don't even realize that it can connect with something else. After a point, if characters, context, premise etc have depth, they will interact with each other in ways that the writer did not anticipate. In other words, a character will have depth and determine what to do and when, whether the writer likes that or not. 

So, without the Prophets, the show would have been unbalanced. Whereas the Founders wanted to be worshiped and they even put that to the genetic make-up of their ""slave""-races, the Prophets couldn't care less. It is ambiguous if the Orbs were sent on purpose or if they were accidentally sent to Bajor. The Prophets are not intervening into Bajoran affairs directly, although they care for them, because both ""are of Bajor"". It is implied that the Prophets were a previous Bajoran civilization (like Atlantis or whatever) that went to the stars, ""ascended"" but still they have connections with the Bajorans they left behind. They are not gods, they don't want to be gods. They don't want to be followed and they don't want their believers to do whatever they (the Prophets) want them (the Bajorans) to do. The Founders are not gods, but they want to be seen as gods. They want to control galactic affairs and they want to control the Vorta and the Jem'hadar. As such, the two ""god""-races need each other dramatically. Their stellar contrasts, illuminate their individual characters. And from there I could go on and on about several connotations.



I will once more say however, that the execution of the Prophets' storyline(s) is sub-par. Not bad, but sub-par."

OK, let me clarify. This is **exactly** what I criticized about. The fact that this connection with real life objects works in different manner.

- nuTrek;

Per that deal it is implied that Sisko will leave the corporeal real forever. 

Originally, Deus Ex Machina was used in Greek drama in order to resolve a situation. For that reason it was used at the end of the show. Additionally the god that showed up (e.g. Athena) was resolving the situation. The End. 

There was no dramatic attachment to it. Which Sisko's ""deal"" had. Actually the whole thing was used to immediately resolve the drama. SO in a sense, they couldn't have been more different.

So, if you ask me it was neither stupid, nor Deus Ex Machina and I will agree with the producers. I will also however, agree with Brooks' ""uncomfortable-ness"" with the show playing the ""missing black father"" trope. This could easily have been resolved by not having Kasidy being pregnant, but I suppose the writers wanted more things at stake. Well, sometimes more is less and less is more. I will also agree with you that the Prophets felt weak, especially in comparison to the other plotlines of the series. 

All these do not make DS9 a bad series or a particular call a ""bad call"". It just makes the whole thing imperfect and that is just fine with me. Sure, the execution could have been a little better, but the ideas per se (e.g. Sisko paying the price for that deal) were good."

EnoughMuskSpam,fr03wrf,t1_fqzx9b7,1589782989.0,"I am not sure exactly what it means but this is what I have gathered.

First and foremost, in case you hadn't come across the phrase ""take the red pill"", let me explain to you what this means. At the movie Matrix, humanity is being trapped into a simulation. Machines have taken over and are using humanity as an energy source. In order to do that, the Machines have created that simulation and they have put the entire humanity in it. Some people however realize through various means that this is a simulation. By doing so, they awaken in the real world. These people have formed a ""resistance"" of sorts. So, the protagonist (a messianic figure) is in the process of being recruited by a ""resistance"" leader. In that scene both men are inside a simulation and the ""resistance"" leader offers a choice to the protagonist; a red pill and a blue (?) pill. Neither pill exists, they are in a simulation after all. It is the choice that the brain will make that will break the brain's resistance to the truth (that what the protagonist knew thus far was a lie) and the protagonist will (literally) awaken. The protagonist of course chooses the red pill and awakens in a Machine ""factory"". The resistance finds him, saves him and the movie goes on.

That movie aired at 1999 (if memory serves me right) and since then the phrase ""take the red pill"" has been popular among conspiracy theorists. They think themselves as ""liberators"" of other people's minds, showing to them that their conspiracy theory (e.g. the Illuminati) exists. Thus the phrase ""take the red pill"" is nothing more than an urge to accept a conspiracy theory or from their point of view, the reality that those who control us, hide from us.

What I do not know is what conspiracy theory Musk is urging people to accept as true. I have seen Ivanka Trump answering to him ""taken""  and one of the two co-creators of the movie to have said to both of them to fuck off, but nothing more. 

From what people have said on the internet, that conspiracy theory seems to be related to COVID-19. Trump at times has expressed such views (e.g. that China made the virus or that the whole thing is a hoax made by the Democrats), but I do not know if Musk is truly into that and what exactly. An additional clue towards that direction is that Musk said a few days ago that he will open a factory of his at a state that is in lockdown. So, from what I gather, Musk in order to serve his financial gain is supporting some sort of conspiracy theory regarding COVID-19.

I am not 100% sure for that and I do not know the specifics, but this is what I have gathered so far. I suppose we will know more in a few days and after a few more (embarrassing) tweets."
EnoughMuskSpam,fr0250w,t1_fqy0drz,1589781526.0,"I disagree (partly) with the explanation given to you. The phrase ""take the red pill"" comes from the movie Matrix. 

In that movie, in case you haven't seen it, the protagonist alongside most of humanity live in a simulation, a lie. A minority of humanity has escaped that simulation and one of their leaders tries to recruit/""awaken"" the protagonist. So, at one scene the resistance leader gives the protagonist a choice. Take the red pill and realize that till then he was living in a simulation or take the blue bill and accept his fate and forget that he questioned reality. Neither pill exists, it is just that the action of choosing will ""trigger"" his brain to realize what is real and what not.

In other words ""take the red pill"" means ""see the truth behind the lies you are being fed"". 

This expression is very popular among conspiracy theorists worldwide. So, ""take the red pill"" means ""the Illuminati are controlling the world, see past their lies"", to state an example.

What I do not know is what Musk considers a lie, ""the simulation"" from the Matrix movies, and what is reality. I have seen people saying that this has something to do with COVID-19, but I have yet to see evidence of it. I would call it plausible, but I haven't see evidence of it.

Supposedly, Musk believes that COVID-19 is some sort of hoax meant to hurt the US economy or whatever. I have seen him saying that he will open (he may already have by now) one of his factories at a US state or city that has a lockdown.

Anyhow, regardless the specifics, Musk is basically a conspiracy theorist now.

PS

I think that since one of the two directors of Matrix tweeted/answered at Musk and Ivanka Trump stating that they ""have taken the red pill"", my explanation is better."

Star_Trek,fqvsyjf,t3_gkz57f,1589684471.0,"> With all the talk about nu-trek, inevitably, there is someone who says something along the lines of ""well, tng season 1 and 2 were terrible too"".

As I have said in the past there are many reasons why such a comparison makes no sense, especially now after all those years.

First and foremost, TNG season 1 and 2, despite any shortcomings they may had, they had also their merits as you correctly point out. Secondly, none of those shortcomings was deviation from what made TOS Star Trek. As I have put it in the past, TOS and TNG used the same ""ingredients"" albeit in different ways, mixtures, ratios, order etc. Lastly, and perhaps more important of them all, is that to the degree that the fans said that they didn't like something, **the producers listened to the fans!!** The producers said that they were wrong and that the fans were right. The producers did not antagonize the fans. It was not that the fans accepted TNG because the fans changed, TNG changed and the fans accepted it. It was the exact opposite situation than the one that the nuTrek apologists are trying to push!!

> To assess, me and my wife sat down to do a fresh-rewatch of just TNG season 1 and 2. To my surprise, we both enjoyed it much more than we thought we would. 

Recently someone linked parts of the then debate among the fans. It was quite evident that most people who complained about TNG did so ""because it was not TOS"". From what I read, I understood that their reaction(s) was a very emotional one that had to do with the fact that when TNG launched the TOS era had yet to be concluded. That makes their reaction(s) understandable. Since however we do not belong to that generation and since we live at a time when both the TOS and TNG have had their endings, we can judge the early seasons of TNG without having to deal with that emotional burden.

>  In fact, I identified qualities in the first two seasons that I think were actually better than season 3 and beyond

Although I see what you mean, I will not agree. For me there was a difference at quality, with later seasons being better. 

The main difference between the early seasons of TNG and the later seasons of TNG is similar to the difference between TOS and the later seasons of TNG. In other words, as far as I can tell, TOS and the first two seasons of TNG are following the same pattern of story-telling, whereas Star Trek after TNG season 3 follow another. And yes that includes DS9.

There are many ways to group things and in this case to group the stories told. One way is to group them based at the distinction between ""episodic format"" and ""arc format"". Sure, that is a way to distinguish storytelling and a very good at that. If we use that, TOS and TNG fall into one category and DS9 falls into another. There is however another way to make that distinction and according to that, TOS and TNG S1-S2 are into one group and later Trek is at another. I do not include anything past 2005 of course. That is not Trek.

So, this other way to make a distinction is how socio-political commentary is being approached story-wise. TOS was perhaps the first sci-fi TV series that had sociopolitical commentary and in case that it wasn't the ""first"", it was most certainly the one that popularized that. Sociopolitical commentary at sci-fi existed before, at novels and cinema, not at TV. At TV sci-fi was more ""superficial"". Novels, TV, cinema, otherwise they all share similarities and differences. This means that if someone wants to make sociopolitical commentary with a sci-fi story they have to follow some tropes. If they want to do so with a novel, they have options that share similarities and differences with cinema and TV. The point is that at that time, the writers, directors and producers of TOS, were pioneers that were making something new; A sci-fi TV series with sociopolitical commentary. In order to do that, they borrowed tropes and story telling means from cinema and novels. They had to adapt them however, since the medium was different. This means that TOS and the early seasons of TNG are ""raw"", ""unrefined"", they lack the subtlety that later Star Trek series and other sci-fi series share. In other words, there were no ""tropes"" for what TOS was trying to do, they were inventing them as they were making TOS. This is the reason behind to some of the worst stories of Star Trek history (e.g. ""Code of Honor"") and why even the best stories were ""crude"", ""unrefined"" and they cannot succeed at the test of time as much as the later stories of TNG (and other Trek). AS they were developing those ""tropes"", those ""methods"", this ""know-how"", the producers and writers were shaping sci-fi in TV in general. This is why we see similarities to Star Trek to pretty much every single sci-fi series. So, by the time of TNG S3, that process had been concluded for the most part and this is why we are seeing TNG getting better. After that we notice subtlety and with that the stories became universal and eternal, being able to pass the test of time with an A+. Something that TOS and TNG S1 and S2 do not get. They get B or B+? Maybe A- at the best of their stories.

That however doesn't mean that there aren't bad stories after TNG season 3. There were always good and bad stories, there will always be good and bad stories. I am not talking about the stories per se here. I am talking about how these stories are being developed, their portrayal on the screen and how sociopolitical commentary was approached and given to the audience.

11) Akiva Goldsman ✔️

So, please do tell me, why are you willing to give this show a chance? 

Cause Anson Mount is in it? Can he carry the entire show? Doubtful. If I were to pick between Patrick Stewart and Anson Mount, I would have picked Patrick Stewart (even now). Look where that lead us! PIC was worse than STD!! 

Cause we are promised, again, that we have been heard? 

1) They said that when they made the course correction for STD S2. 

2) They said that when they made the course correction for STD S3 and they sent Discovery into the future because they realized that they can't keep up with canon. Now they are undoing that exact course correction. For fuck's sakes, just for that, I am willing to watch STD S3 and not watch the ""Pike show"". At the ""Pike show"" they are doing **the exact mistake they did with STD!!** At least STD S3 has a new recipe, I would be more willing to place my hopes at the new recipe than the recipe that failed Star Trek time and time again. This is what? The third time they are trying to revisit the TOS era? The Abraams movies, STD and now the ""Pike show"". And it is the fourth time they are trying to make a reboot/prequel, since we will have to count ENT too. I have had enough with that recipe for disaster.

3) They said that when they made the course correction from STD to PIC. At least back then they weren't exactly backtracking their own ""course corrections"". At least back then Stewart was involved and say anything you want about him, but he has better knowledge of Star Trek than Anson Mount. Did Stewart put his ego, his paycheck and his own political agenda(s) above his understanding of Star Trek? Yeah. Is it possible that Stewart never truly understood Picard if the car chase at Nemesis and PIC are any indication? Yeah. Now, imagine that. Anson Mount has less experience than Stewart at Trek, his involvement wasn't exactly stellar, as such, why should I place more hopes to him than Stewart? And if Stewart failed me, why should I expect anything but that from Anson Mount? Especially since Kurtzman and Goldsman are involved. Because of a promise? 

Words, empty and vacuous words, that is what we only got from those producers. Fuck words!

At one hand they dismiss us as a minority of sexists, racists and homophobes, while at the other hand they try to sound appealing to us!! That is called hypocrisy, desperation and admittance that we are their audience and not whoever they are trying to appeal to with the crap they are producing. And they have proven that they are hypocrites, when they say one thing and do another. They make a course correction and send Discovery into the future in order to get rid themselves from the shackles of canon, then they put themselves back at those exact shackles! Fuck them.

Now, I am on the verge of not watching the show even if you tell me that it is good. You would have to go to great lengths to convince me that it is good.

OK guys, gather up, time for story time;

When the new Star Trek series (STD) was announced I heard it at the radio as I was going to the Uni. For the entire course I couldn't think of anything else. When I got back I googled for it and I got excited cause the production value seemed through the roof. I tried not to learn more about the series in order not to expose myself into spoilers. So, suffice it to say that I was really excited for it. 

A few months/weeks before the launch of the series I saw the trailer at YouTube and I commented something down the lines of;

> I like the looks of the new aliens

to which someone informed that;

> these are Klingons!

....

....

and I was like....

> WHAAAAAAAATT?


That was the first red flag for me. Regardless I watched the show. The pilot (the first two episodes) left me with mixed feelings. Sure, the production value was there, but the writing, acting and directing was subpar. Also I had noticed that the series was bordering becoming anti-Trek. I am on the record at the other sub pointing that and I was among the first, if I may say so for myself. I decided to give the show a chance and watch the entire first season. By the end of it the show had proven to be anti-Trek and having bad directing, bad writing and bad acting. Furthermore, the production value dropped midway, since apparently they misused those millions Netflix gave them.

I will shamefully admit that I am on the record at the other sub that, after Fuller leaving, Kurtzman taking over was a good thing. So, suffice it to say that I was still hopeful and excited about the show and I was waiting for season 2.

I was subscribed (and not blocked) at the time at the other sub and  when I open reddit, by default I am seeing the ""best"" from ""home"", which means that I am seeing the ""best"" from subs to which I have subscribed to. I rarely, if ever, visit ""all"". Furthermore, most of the time I just go through the first 25 posts of the first page and I rarely go after that.

So, I was waiting for STD S2 and I knew that it was delayed for whatever reason. I was waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and then I see a post from the other sub (probably because I moved past the first 25 posts of my homepage) about the 3rd episode of the second season of STD and I was like....what? When did that show start?! You wanna talk about STD's success? The S2 was so quietly launched that I did not even know it had started and I was waiting for it. I was the one who was expecting it. At no other place had I seen talks about it. Even the traffic at the other sub was so low that it couldn't beat my own homepage. I am not talking ""all"" here, I am talking about making it to the top 25 OPs of the subs to which I have subscribed. 

OK then, I went to the pirate site I use and I went to watch the first 3 episodes. I was totally unimpressed and realized that much of my criticism should not have been directed to Fuller but to Kurtzman. I still was willing to watch a little bit more so I waited for the fourth episode. I was waiting and waiting and waiting....""hold on, where is the fourth episode?  It has been 10 days, it should have been here"". I went to the other sub and realized that 5 episodes had aired but at the pirate site I was using I could find only 3. I searched at another pirate site and I eventually found the fourth episode, I watched it and....I dropped STD. I don't think I ever bothered with the fifth episode.

So, my point is that pirates will bother to pay the streaming provider, download their shows and then put them to a pirate site in order to make (in whatever manner) profit. They are basically...Ferengis. 

So, the fact that the pirate site I was mainly using did not have all the episodes means that the pirate who was uploading them, was not making profit. As such they dropped the show and stopped paying CBS All Access because I dropped the show. In other words, if you are watching a series in pirate form you still generate revenue for the streaming provider. Indirectly, sure and less so, but you do. 

So the question is; Do you want to give a cent to Kurtzman? I don't. Which is why I did not watch STD past S02E04 and PIC past S01E04, despite the fact that I would have paid....nothing.

Ever since TNG was about to air, CBS, Paramount and Roddenberry had agreed that only CBS/Paramount productions were to be canon and every licensed work would not.

Furthermore, the very strict rules of canon for Star Trek (as well as in-universe concepts like the quantum realities) allow Star Trek to have a nuTrek free canon, unlike Star Wars, which is extremely unlikely that they can have a Sequel trilogy free canon."

I have seen none of these but ""Pan's Labyrinth"", which was great. Hmmm, the Faun? Well, I will stick with my previous assessment. Above average. I **ADORE** ""Pan's Labyrinth"", Doug Jones as the Faun was just....OK. I suppose the point of the movie wasn't to focus at the Faun and the stellar performances from everyone else did not allow Jones to take the spotlight, but still count me as unimpressed. 

>  he can't save a bad script

No, he can't. I have numerous times have said that writing comes first and foremost and that actors can't save a bad script. 

That said, good acting just slips through the corners of a bad script. For example at PIC Patrick Stewart gave some such good moments, proving once more that he is a good actor. Patrick Stewart delivered the only good scene nuTrek has, the interview scene. A bad scene by directing and writing standards. Directing wise it had too many cuts and unnecessary cuts at that. Writing wise it was a mess. But Stewart managed to deliver. 

Hell, I will even say something good for the most toxic actor among the STD cast; Wilson Cruz.

By no standards a good actor, below average if you ask me like Wiseman, but there was a scene when he managed to show just a little bit of talent. 

It is the scene when Ash/Voq has an existential crisis and goes to Culber (Cruz). At the time Culber was treating Stamets (Anthony Rapp) who was tripping from inhaling too much of the Space Mushrooms. In that weird and confusing scene, Culber and Ash discuss that Ash may or may not be a ""Manchurian Candidate""/sleeper agent but also he can't be a ""Manchurian Candidate"", because the first thing Starfleet did was to look for that, but also there is a possibility for that and....what is Ash exactly? We still don't know!! So, in that very confusing, nonsensical and badly written scene, Voq is triggered (in order for the secret not to be revealed) and he kills Culber. By all standards a badly written scene and one with lens flare and the camera moving all the time (if memory serves me right), so directing wise it is also really bad.

So, at that scene I will note two instances of acting; one bad, one good. As Culber and Ash are talking, Stamets starts talking some nonsense (later proved to be information from the mirror universe and/or the future or whatever cause...mushrooms). At that time Culber looks at Stamets, all the while Ash is talking. The whole thing lasts just 1-3 seconds, till Ash says something that catches Culber's attention again. In those 3 seconds, you have Culber showing conflict. At one hand he has a duty to perform (to his patient who reached out to him and later to his crew to protect them from a possible spy), while at the other hand he is worried about his husband (Stamets) who is tripping bad! You can see that Culber has his ear at Ash and his eye at Stamets. As I often say, good acting can be proven by subtleties and by the extremes. So, that subtle 3 second move of Cruz's head was enough to prove (to me) that he has just a slip of talent. I won't give him more credit than that, because he failed to deliver anything remotely like that again, before or after. Quite the opposite, when Stamets and Culber meet in the Afterlife/Mycelial Network, both actors are 110% cringe worthy. You may say that the material they were given is to be blamed. Sure, it is to be blamed, but a good actor will make a 100% cringe worth material, 90% cringe and a bad one will make it 110% cringe. Similarly (and in contrast to Cruz's performance at that scene), Stamets (Rapp) at the end of the scene holds Culber, talks nonsense (cause he is tripping) and rocks back and forth in one of the most cringe worthy scenes in sci-fi!! Rapp at that time made a cringe worthy scene, even cringier. This is why he is a terrible actor. 

As for Doug Jones, I can't recall such a good moment (like I can for Cruz), but at the same time he manages to keep the cringe of his character to a minimum. He is given 100% cringe material and makes it ~80-90% cringe. You can notice that when Saru (Doug Jones) interacts with Michael (Sonequa Martin-Green). They both are given a 100% cringe scene, Jones manages to diminish that as much as possible, whereas Green takes the cringe to whole new levels. How they look at the camera, the ways they tilt their heads, the way the deliver their lines, they are stellar opposites. Same script, same scene, same writer, same director, the two performances can't be more different. Jones manages to limit the cringe, Green is just awful. 

That however is not enough for me to say that Jones is a good actor. He is above average (that is for sure) and since he manages to keep the cringe so limited almost every time, I will say that he **may be** good, but I haven't seen proof of that. And the proof you bring? Well, I  have seen only ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and from that I still won't change my mind.

I will end this with another comparison. Patrick Stewart, a good actor by all standards, [did **NOT** manage to limit the cringe of his material every single time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4towujqjBQ). I will however say that I haven't seen the entirety of STD and the entirety of PIC. I have seen STD till S02E04 (or whichever is the one with the Sphere) and I have seen PIC till S01E04 (or whichever is the episode before the episode at which we see Icheb's eye removed). So, as far as I have seen, Jones manages to keep the cringe to a minimum, Stewart did not. Stewart however delivered a good performance at PIC's pilot, Jones has yet to do so."

Kurtzman and the nuTrek apologists want to sell a success story. Kurtzman's actions speak louder than his words though and prove us right!

- STD S1;

 The fans didn't like it. We were called sexists, racists and homophobes, we were called ""a vocal minority"" whose opinions should be dismissed and the show was called ""a success that brought record number of subscribers to CBS All Access"".

- STD S2;

 Despite the fact that our opinion(s) was to be dismissed as the opinion(s) of a minority that is sexist, racist and homophobic and despite the fact that STD S1 was ""a success"", STD S2 had a ""course correction"" and it tried to be more ""Star Trek"".

 The fans still didn't like it, cause it still was badly written, badly directed, badly acted and badly produced. How could we have had a different result, it was being made by the same people.

 Once more, we were called a ""vocal minority"" and our opinion was to be dismissed. Once more the show was called ""a success"".

- STD S3;

 Some fans had criticized the fact that STD was as if it was taking place after TNG since it looked more futuristic. Despite the fact that we were dismissed, flipped and libeled, Kurtzman made a second ""course correction"" and said that it was difficult for them to follow canon so they had to move into the future.

 So, while he was saying we were wrong and a bunch of assholes, he was saying that we were right and he was making ""course corrections"" and ""shifts in tones"" in the direction we were pointing! 🤦‍♂️

 In the meantime that ""course correction"" was only superficially towards the area we were pointing. A number of wrongdoings are still there. The same talent-less actors, the same talent-less directors, the same talent-less writers and the same 21 producers, each pulling at different directions.

 STD S3 has yet to air, but if Andromeda and the CV of the persons involved are any indication, STD S3 will suck.

- PIC S1

 In the meantime we are no longer ""a vocal minority"". Now the fandom is divided! LOL! The fandom was so negative and for so long expressing its negative views that they could no longer call us ""a minority"". I suppose that we still are called ""sexists"", ""racists"" and ""homophobes"" though. Well, I suppose that there is a Ferengi rule of acquisition that states that it is good to alienate your customers!

 Despite that, PIC brought old and beloved characters and cast. The fandom reacted with some optimism. Patrick Stewart was involved, he is a good actor. Oh look now he is a producer, he will bring Kurtzman and co up to speed and teach them what Star Trek is, right? The show promised to be ""slow paced"" and to have sociopolitical commentary within the show, something that the fans wanted and were asking. 

 The sexists, racists and homophobes, were asking **stories** against sexism, racism and homophobia. They were asking **stories** and not token characters, whose whole identity was ""the gay"" and ""the black female lead"". They considered those token and vacuous characters offensive, exactly because they were tokens and vacuous. Yet, they (the fans) were the ones who were called sexists, racists and homophobes! The irony!

 So, once more the production team promised what the sexist, racist and homophobic fans were asking. Did they deliver? 

 Well, they delivered what they promised, from the back door, the ass! Oops wrong hole and no lube was used!

 Now the UFP is a dystopia for no reason and the protagonists just accept that and move on with their lives. There is no sociopolitical commentary as to why the UFP ended like that and the protagonists couldn't give a damn for it. Nihilism has taken the place of hope.

 The fans once more protested and they were once more called sexists, racists and homophobes. 

 In the meantime, this time around the show could not be called ""a success"". The show's finale was shown for free, the Canada ratings were crystal clear, mainstream media were against the new dystopic tone and the CBS stock was plummeting, because CBS had to announce losses. But why did CBS have losses? Experts at Forbes noted that CBS was falling behind its peers to launch a streaming service. Hold on, I thought that CBS All Access was doing record numbers! Well, apparently less than 16 million is not a record! And saying that CBS All Access has 16 million is wrong. CBS across all its streaming services, has 16 million, meaning that CBS All Access has what? 8? 10? 12? Well, I will be gracious and say that it has 16 million. Still, hardly a record. Star Trek, one of the main sci-fi/genre IPs, was unable to spearhead and jump start CBS' streaming service! And it is not like that time was not given to them. They had 3 years to ""make it so"" (pun unintended but welcomed). 

 I suppose that STD and PIC are still a success right? Right?! 

- ""The Pike Series""

 Despite the fact that the fans were once more flipped, the new show was launched with people involved at it saying things like;

 > We heard you (Kurtzman himself)

 and

 > an optimistic Star Trek (Anson Mount)

 Wait a minute, but I thought I was wrong. I thought that I was the minority. I thought that at best I was the 50% (equal division). I thought that I was a sexist, a racist and a homophobe. I thought that the new world that we live in should be all about dystopia. I thought that this is what brings ""record numbers"" at 2020. This is what you told me again and again. If that is the case, why are you promising me what I want? Why are you promising me an ""optimistic Star Trek""? I thought that nuTrek was a success! Why change the recipe of success and listen to me?!

You may say;

> OK mate, just enjoy it. You asked for them to listen to you and they did.

No they didn't. They promised that, they didn't deliver that. I am sick of their words, I want actions. I have been fed enough of their vacuous words and their actions that go against Trek's message of hope. And if that last part was debatable till now, it is no longer debatable. PIC proved that they want the dystopia. They defended their dystopic vision.

1)  They said that they had listened when they made the ""course correction"" from STD S1 to STD S2 - they failed.

2)  They said that they had listened when they made the ""course correction"" from STD to PIC - they failed.

3)  They said that they had listened when they made the ""course correction"" from STD S2 to STD S3 and all indication is that they will fail.

4)  They say that now, when they are making the ""course correction"" from PIC/Dystopia to ""Pike""/Utopia. Why should I believe them now?

At best they are sincere in their intention but they are;

a) unable to deliver and

b) antagonistic towards their customers, whom they dismiss but at the same time they try to appeal to.

So fuck them.

[There is no doubt that STD and PIC are not bringing the numbers to CBS All Access](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2020/04/08/viacomcbs-downward-spiral-is-accelerating-as-talk-of-unraveling-grows/#260a56f77b09). This has seen the light of the day. [It was like a week ago that I was reading that CBS ~~All Access~~ is having just ~~15~~ 16 million subscribers across all its streaming services, when Disney+ has 28 million!](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2020/04/08/viacomcbs-downward-spiral-is-accelerating-as-talk-of-unraveling-grows/#260a56f77b09) And we are not talking about Amazon and Netflix here.

There is no doubt that STD and PIC are not fairing good at Canada. They air at open air TV and their ratings are known and unimpressive. [At Canada, PIC mid season lost ~1/4 of its viewers!](https://boundingintocomics.com/2020/03/05/star-trek-picard-viewership-plummets-over-half-a-million-in-canada/)

There is no doubt that streaming services, besides CBS All Access, are not interested at nuTrek. Netflix did not buy PIC and no-one bought Lower Decks. PIC S2 and ""the Pike Show"" also lack international broadcasters for the moment. 

No-one can deny those facts. 

Additionally, although Netflix aired STD S2 and will air STD S3, it may have not committed more money into it! When STD S2 and STD S3 were ordered, Netflix broadcasting them was in the press releases and subsequent articles, but any financial commitment was not. Isn't that weird? When STD S1 was being broadcasted, articles circulated that were writing that the season costed ~8 million per episode for a total of 120 million. It was also reported that Netflix paid the entirety of it. This may technically be true, but it can be true in multiple ways. One is to say that Netflix ordered one season and paid 120 million for it. That's excessive don't you think? Another is for Netflix to have bought multiple seasons  (e.g. 3) and have given them 120 million for the entire deal, that Kurtzman burned only at the first season, leaving CBS to take all the cost for the other two! Well, that seems more likely now, doesn't it? Not only it is more logical for Netflix to do, but also it fits the facts better. Netflix did not commit more money for seasons 2 and 3, not per any article I have read. Additionally, the production value has dropped. STD S1 was showing that it was an expensive show, STD S2 not so much. STD S3? That remains to be seen, but while PIC was supposed to be an expensive show...it was cheap as fuck! Making credible the rumors (from people who more often than not are wrong) that Kurtzman took PIC's budget and diverted it to STD S3!! Which would have made Amazon angry, which Amazon hasn't been in any of the PIC S2 announcements! DO you see the pattern?

Furthermore, some nuTrek fans (that I doubt that are watching the show) at Twitter are saying that the fact that there are five (?) Star Trek shows is proof of a ""golden age"". Well, no-one in their right mind can say that, cause as you correctly said, successful shows are not spinning spin-offs left and right. Neither they change direction every season. STD has changed direction 3 times in the course of 3 years and this has been said by Kurtzman himself!

He always says; ""we heard you"" and then announces a course correction. Hold on, I thought that you were successful as it is. Why change the recipe of success?! Their own actions prove that we are right!

So, overall, enough has seen the light, that has been verified, and we know that this whole thing is about contractual agreements. 

The bottom line is that Kurtzman's production company has **LICENSED** the Star Trek IP till 2023 (included or not). This was one of the last actions Moonves (the previous CBS head) took. As such, it is Kurtzman who decides what to make and when and then he sells it to CBS and International Broadcasters, like Amazon and Netflix. Seemingly, CBS is under contractual agreement(s) to buy something. Netflix and Amazon (and the rest) are not. Which is why Netflix did **NOT** buy PIC and no-one bought either of the two kid shows. Which is why CBS announced PIC S2 **before** PIC S1 airing, but Amazon hasn't committed yet. 

So, from what I have seen evidence of (not rumors, but black and white) and what I can deduce from that, Kurtzman has two bad shows at his hands, he doesn't want to cancel them in order not to admit failure and he tries to sell ""new"" things over and over again (by saying each time that he listened to us this time), in an effort to make as many money as possible till 2023, when his contract ends. 

So, I will just wait for 2023/2024 to either say ""I told you so"" or eat my own words. Cause till that time, the contract is in black and white and at best we will know any truths indirectly (e.g. by CBS ~~All Access~~ announcing to their investors that they have only ~~15~~ 16 million subscribers across all platforms)."

> Other limitations of the study include the fact that the researchers only measured concentrations of ACE2 in plasma, not in tissues, so they cannot be sure that concentrations in the blood are similar to those seen in tissues; it is the ACE2 in the lung tissues that are thought to be important for viral infection of the lungs, not ACE2 concentrations in the blood.

ACE2 is the protein that interacts with the virus' Spike Protein. If the Spike Protein interacts **with a cell's ACE2**, then the virus infects the cell. This gives rise to the possibility of using ACE2 as a drug. 

Let's suppose that I am infected. There are 5,000 viruses in my blood. Each one of them will find a cell with ACE2 and infect it. This means that 5,000 cells of mine will be infected. Imagine now that ACE2 is free in my blood stream. This will mean that the virus will interact with the free ACE2 and it will not be able to infect my cells. As such, scientists have proposed of giving ACE2 to patients, so that this ACE2 to interact with the Spike Protein making the virus unable to infect cells. 

You may say that what I am saying now contradicts the article. Not quite. The article works at an assumption. Men have more free ACE2 in their blood because they produce more ACE2 on their cells.

If we want to be absolutely detailed about it, the number of ACE2 on the cells is not important and neither is the number of ACE2 in blood circulation. What is important is their ratio. 

Let's work with the previous example. I have 5,000 viruses inside me. If I have 0 ACE2 in my blood, these 5,000 viruses will find 5,000 cells with ACE2 on them and infect them. If I have 2,000 ACE2 in my blood, I will get infected by 3,000 viruses. If I have 7,000 ACE2 in my blood, no virus will infect my cells!

Now, imagine men having x2 ACE2 in their blood but x3 on their cells than women. That would have explained why men are more prone to develop serious complications. Having x3 ACE2 in their blood and x2 ACE2 on their cells, would (probably) have worked beneficially for men, since more ACE2 is in their blood than on their cells, meaning that chances would have been that the viruses would have interacted with the free ACE2 and would haven't entered the cells.

This is why the authors are suggesting more research and specifically to test if ACE2 on the cells of men  is more than on cells of women. And if you ask why they didn't do that? Cause that is many times more difficult than measuring whatever is in your blood.

Getting back at plasma donations, I doubt that we would have seen any difference between plasma donations between men and women. If we will see any difference, I expect it to be in favor of men.

To understand this, ask yourself; What do you want to achieve by plasma donation?

In our plasma we have antibodies. So, in the plasma of people (both men and women) who have been cleared from the disease and have immunity now, there are antibodies for the virus. These antibodies will interact with the viruses stopping them from entering and infecting the cells.

Assuming that both men and women have an equal amount of antibodies, the question on whose plasma is better has to do with whose blood has more free ACE2. Which would be the men according to this study. 

So, let's suppose that both men and women have 3,000 antibodies in their plasma. Men have 1,000 ACE2 and women have 700 ACE2. I am sick and I have 5,000 viruses in my blood stream. I receive plasma from a man. 3,000 of my viruses will be ""blocked"" by the 3,000 antibodies and 1,000 viruses will be ""blocked"" by the free ACE2. That is total of 4,000 viruses out of 5,000, leaving only 1,000 viruses for my immune system to deal with. If I were to receive plasma from a woman, the viruses ""blocked"" would have been 3,700, leaving 1,300 viruses for my immune system to deal with. Whether that difference is clinical significant is another question, but if it is, then it is in favor for men's blood.

What people need to realize is that unfortunately we don't have all the answers. Actually, we have very few answers and we are dealing the pandemic to a significant degree blindfolded."

> Look the base I made!

LOL, the game is so good at being a building base game that completely negates the violent world of Conan. You can play it locally at your own world  (single player) that can also be co-op. You can play it online at a PvE environment or PvP, which I suppose is not what you are asking. It also has PvC (PvE Conflict) which basically is PvE with PvP allowed at specific times. Don't worry your base is safe and you can lock yourself in your base at that time and be safe.

For you, I'd advice to play it at single player or co-op. For whatever reason I am not having much fun at PvE/PvC. Probably because people are competing for resources and after 2 years it will be hard for you to compete with old players. At single player you can do whatever you want and if you want company you can bring a friend (or more?) and play co-op.

To that add two bonuses;

1) You can make your own servers if you know how, can afford it etc etc.

2) At the single player (which I suggest), you can play either fair and square or you can make yourself admin and cheat. Why would you want to do that? If you want to focus at the building element it will take you a lot of time to gather the materials, level, explore and the like. So, you can grant admin status to yourself, level up to max instantly, assign your points (which allow you access to certain crafting recipes), open the admin panel and ""order"" X from the material you require delivered at your inventory instantly. Now all you have to do is make the largest castle you can imagine.

If however you enjoy the process of gathering the mats, exploring, playing and leveling etc, then you can just play fair and square. Personally, I mostly play fair and square with a few exceptions. For example once I was killed far from my base, respawned at my base and instead of making the long trip to my dead body to retrieve my inventory, I just teleported to my dead body with admin teleportation.

The only reason I would not recommend Conan Exiles is if you don't like violence. It is a violent game. For example you cut your enemies in half. I mean that literally. You can cut them in half and see their dead bodies into two pieces."
Animemes,fqa45bo,t3_g5fdzq,1589212490.0,"As a former tank I find that offensive. If I were to draw ""many"" NPCs I would have known that I could have survived their beating. So there would have been no reason to worry, I would just be doing my job as a masochist tank. 

The problem arises when DPS-chan decides to play tank and it is her who should pull the mob! Which is what I was expecting that would happen at this meme.

At that time everyone panics. We tanks are trying to aggro, the healers are trying to heal both DPS-chan and Maso-Tank who is pulling mobs who disregard her safety word, everyone is pointing the finger to DPS-chan and DPS-chan still acts as a tank! Then people start leaving and the raid is over."
Star_Trek,fq9y1ep,t3_ggps5q,1589209263.0,"I don't get why we have to deal with a 3 year old post that is about a 3 year old post!

That said, I find it interesting that people had raised those concerns that early on, although I will say that the then OP was only partially correct. For example I will not agree with the following he had to say;

> Fact is, I didn't want to see a pre-Kirk Star Trek show about the mental and emotional development of **some girl** [emphasis mine as well]. It doesn't sound original to me, it doesn't sound interesting, it actually sounds boring as shit.

Regarding that specific quote [I will agree with Formula_410](https://old.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/4y5z3s/someone_in_rstartrek_posts_concerns_about_the/d6luq1d/), whom I purposely do not call into the discussion, since the discussion is about something that took place 3 years ago and I don't think he would like to get into the discussion again after so long.

From the comments, the bits and pieces that survived and me skimming them, I will however agree that the problem was that they always intended at focusing at one person. Star Trek is about a crew and its relationships and not about one person. This should have been a very early on red flag and I suppose that for some people it was. 

Furthermore, I will agree with /u/Bannakka that the characters are so badly written that regardless their demographic(s) they would still be bad. 

As for ""forced diversity""? At that I will disagree with /u/Bannakka, probably because we have different views at what ""forced diversity"" is. As far as I am concerned, ""forced diversity"" is nothing more than a publicity stunt. Instead of making a character with substance, some ""writers"" are making empty, vacuous characters that they are trying to pass as ""progressive"", ""important"" or whatever, by overemphasizing their demographic(s). ""Forced diversity"" is nothing but vacuous diversity aka [tokenism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenism). 

I will say however, that many people are not expressing that well enough and this allows the PC mob (or however you wanna call them) to start ""retaliating"" with their own nonsense. In the process we end up in a vicious cycle of hatred. I'll pass thank you.

So, /u/Bannakka, the fact that STD's characters are vacuous and badly written is related to the fact that they are  a bunch of ""minority characters"", despite the fact that their ""minority status"" did not lead them at being bad characters. Actually it is the other way around. They were bad characters and in order to have them ""relate"" to some people and have some people defend them, they were made ""minority characters"". Which is why the whole process is self defeating and why progressive people should dismiss these token characters."
Star_Trek,fq7aac4,t1_fq0nl7h,1589143804.0,"I wouldn't know about /r/startrekmemes as I am not frequently there. As for ""seeing the humour"" at the video you posted, I can see its humour, which however is completely unrelated to Star Trek, regardless if you claim it to be. Claims are irrelevant as well.

All that said, the only person who seems to have been triggered and needs to relax is you. I did not comment at your OP and I did not comment specifically about your OP. So, take your advice and apply it to yourself, cause I am perfectly calm and you seem to be projecting.

Lastly, in regards to my comment and ""Darth being willing to let people make jokes"", I am all for jokes and light hearted content as long as it is remotely relevant to the sub. As I have said numerous times at other subs, I have seen OPs that I find agreeable and I would have upvoted at another sub, but I am either downvoting them or reporting them cause they are not relevant to the specific sub. Relevance is very important at social media like reddit, they are revolving around it. So, next time? Next time, you should make a joke that is relevant to Star Trek. Otherwise, find another sub that fits your OP better. And Darth? Darth needs to intervene when that does not happen. It is simple actually."
Star_Trek,fpysvds,t1_fpxaegi,1589008729.0,"Your post specifically does not piss me off, although I will once more say that it is not relevant to the sub. You want to play the ""humour"" card? OK, there is /r/startrekmemes for that.

That said, if I were a moderator I would let it slide any other day, since it is borderline relevant/irrelevant and I too am in favour of subs that are moderated as little as possible, I would not let it slide in midst of other shit-posts however, cause ""as little as possible"" means existent."

Star_Trek,fpvemw9,t3_gfd1o6,1588943048.0,"Every single non Star Trek related OP should be removed. As simple as that. I use the old version of reddit, so I can't see the rules, but by default and since logic dictates it, rule #1 is relevance. All these posts are not Star Trek related and so they should be removed as such. And don't try and tell me that [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Star_Trek/comments/gfjthd/agnes_jurati/) is about a Star Trek character!

You may say that you don't want to ""over"" moderate. Well, it is the logical rule #1, so it is not over-moderation. And frankly, you have over-moderated at times. You know, when you get triggered by ""slurs"" and especially the whole ""fat shaming"" thing. Guess what? You should be ""ashamed"" if you are fat! 

You literally have a medical condition/disease (obesity is recognised as such), which you defend! That is insane. That is like saying that you want cancer! ""Oh please, don't cancer-shame, I want to have cancer!"" No! You are insane! Fuck off. 

It is one thing for people to shun someone else because they have a medical condition and say that this should not happen and quite another to defend a medical condition. Are you fat DarthMeow? OK, we should not shun you for it. If you were bullied for it, that was wrong. But saying that being fat is bad for your health is not bullying. It is simply, the truth. And using humour to convey that, regardless how crude and ""inappropriate"", is not bullying either. 

So, once more, you are not moderating this community as well as you think you do. You tolerate trolls and shit-posters at one hand and you over-moderate in the same style like the other sub at some other cases (e.g. ""they used a slur call the Internet police""). Fuck off! And I am not saying that you and the crazy mods at the other sub are the same. I am saying that you show a (as one [1]) very specific similarity, to a lesser degree. That is worrisome enough if you ask me.

Lastly, you seem to lack any knowledge and/or experience at moderating the sub technically. Beyond who will get banned and which post will get removed.

As such I will say again that you need to do two things;

1) You seem like a reasonable person who is able to enforce objectively any rules the sub may have. You however are not good at determining those rules. So put that to a vote. Have people suggest any rules they want, have them being voted and have the ones that get 51% be the rules of the sub. Then occasionally put them to a vote again, let's say once per year. And it will be solely you who will enforce them.

2) Have another mod join you. Someone with technical experience. Many people use the old reddit and we can't even see the rules. Ask for someone's help and have them be the technical moderator. If you are afraid that they will get in your way of enforcing objectively and fairly the rules, don't give them that power. Not all moderators are the same. Mod powers can be assigned to them. Don't ask me how, I don't know! I have seen though mod teams with some mods having ""full permissions"" ([like yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/Star_Trek/about/moderators)) and others having specific privileges/permissions. So give the person you choose the ability to change the outlook of the sub, utilize bots and whatever else, but not being able to moderate comments, posts and ban people.

You need to acknowledge that not only you are not good at everything but also that some things you simply can't do. This is why people create teams. To complement each other."

Star_Trek,fprk3i4,t3_gex1x3,1588856087.0,"Corgana is correct; ""Mary Sue"" **IS** a specifically defined term and its definition is not subjective, but instead objective.

Corgana is incorrect though; Whether a character meets those objective criteria is **NOT** up to you/someone. That would defeat the objectivity mentioned earlier.

Corgana is correct; Some people do use the term and accusation of ""Mary Sue"" incorrectly in order to push their own political agenda(s).

Corgana is incorrect; I was debating with people about STD at their sub for ~2 years. I was moderately critical against the show. I never had the displeasure of seeing ""those people"" there. I have seen them at YouTube (at videos and comments), I had not seen them there. Ironically, I was basically accused of being one of ""those people"" and banned for it, when there, here, at other subs, at Twitter and at YouTube I have spoken against ""those people"". And by ""those people"" I meant and mean the so called ""phantom menace"" YouTubers, not including whoever watches and enjoys their videos, who I consider ""victims"" of the aforementioned YouTubers.

So, basically Corgana and his/her peers, created a strawman argument based at half truths, in order to silence all valid criticism towards nuTrek. 

Cool, OK! 

As I said to them directly, to their sub, to other nuTrek apologists and as I am saying in general, you can't silence the truth. The truth will always be out there. No matter how hard you try to silence it.

> They’ve [ViacomCBS] also lagged behind their peers in launching a subscription streaming service that could compete with Disney+, Netflix, Hulu, NBCUniversal’s Peacock and Warner Media’s HBO Max.

If nuTrek wasn't bad, it wouldn't have been failing. If nuTrek wasn't failing, CBS All Access wouldn't have had half the numbers of any other streaming service. It is that simple. You can't avoid objective reality. Stick your head into the sand and pretend that COVID-19 doesn't exist. All you will get is [anally probed by reality!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GvIPiomE6I)"
Star_Trek,fprhsqi,t3_geyiiq,1588854496.0,"I have seen some people blaming PIC or STD or both for ViacomCBS' mess. Although they are right to associate nuTrek with ViacomCBS' failure (at least partially), they are wrong and at least ""superficial"" when it comes to prove it. 

For example I have seen the stupid association of pointing when the stock went down and when the episode of PIC at which it shows Icheb's eye, aired. That is so stupid. It is like saying that the investors are watching PIC and then they didn't like Icheb's eye being removed in that way and they sold their ViacomCBS stocks or something.

Instead what really happened is rather simple. ViacomCBS announced losses for the previous year. Investors don't watch CBS shows, they just get the memo of whether ViacomCBS is having profits or losses. The moment they saw that ViacomCBS had losses they didn't like that and some started selling. That made the situation worse.

You may say that many companies are showing losses but they are not getting that financial trouble. Sure, cause these companies have something that makes them appealing and investors see the trouble as temporary.

It is at those two things that nuTrek is partially involved.

If nuTrek was a financial success as the shills want to convince us, then ViacomCBS wouldn't have any losses, it would have had profits. OK, some may say that ViacomCBS is more than Star Trek. True, but Star Trek is its flagship (pun unintended). If the major franchise is going good, it can mitigate (pun unintended) pretty much anything and everything. If it is mediocre at best, let alone it loses money, then other franchises (e.g. whatever police procedurals CBS has) can't carry the network.

And while I would entertain discussion on the matter if nuTrek was at CBS (the free network) where we would have had access to its numbers/rating and it would be among many other CBS productions, I will not entertain anything of the like now. The article is clear;

> **They’ve also lagged behind their peers in launching a subscription streaming service** that could compete with Disney+, Netflix, Hulu, NBCUniversal’s Peacock and Warner Media’s HBO Max. 

nuTrek is practically their only CBS All Access production. So, CBS All Access success or failure depends solely at nuTrek. CBS All Access failed, everyone knows that and the only people who deny it are at this point crazy, as they are completely out of touch with reality. Hence, nuTrek failed.

Once more some shill may say that CBS All Access failed, despite nuTrek's success, because it had only two shows (STD and PIC). Well, not true. I would have accepted that argument 3+ years ago, not now. 

When CBS launched CBS All Access they did the logical thing to do. They brought the big guns, their main franchise (Star Trek), in order to spearhead and jump start their streaming service. If STD S1 was successful, then they would have had the money and the subscribers to make more shows, unrelated to Star Trek, and they would have had a full portfolio. By 2020, if their main shows at CBS All Access (the nuTrek shows) were successful, this would have been enough to experiment with new shows, try new thins, see what sticks and what not, all the while Star Trek's success would be ""safety cushion"" and eventually make a successful streaming service. This didn't happen. Star Trek failed to jump start CBS' streaming service, leaving it for 3+ years into a vacuous emptiness of nothing. For 3+ years, nuTrek failed to bring enough money that could have been used to invest and make a new unrelated to Star Trek show.

Please nuTrek apologists, do tell me how ""successful"" your garbage of shows are? For fuck's sakes, you don't watch them! You just tweet about them.

I for once, as a sadomasochist, draw pleasure from it. nuTrek killed itself, good riddance. At this point though I fear that Star Trek is dead, nuTrek killed it. Well, frankly, I don't mind that. I'd rather have no Star Trek at all and re-watch the TOS and TNG eras, than see Star Trek killed, raped and thrown into the mud (aka nuTrek), in that order. Besides, all good things must come to an end (pun intended). The important thing is for the ending to be...good."
