Multivariable Calculus - overall just the worst math class I have taken at Columbia. I generally love my math classes (Linear Algebra was my favorite so far). Even if I read the textbook and went to lecture, the Multi problem sets were extremely hard to understand. To be clear I was able to solve the textbook practice problems fairly easily with no extra help. I wasted so much time trying to grasp what the homework problems were asking... let alone solve them. Same thing for exams. The concepts weren’t too bad themselves so I’d recommend taking this class literally anywhere else."
internetparents,fqhvm64,t3_giz0la,1589385377.0,"If you can find access to it, possibly through a school counselor or your doctor, I would suggest trying Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Instead of just talking about your feelings, you will learn actual skills to help your mind deal with difficult situations. It can help you identify “fallacies” your brain constructs when thinking about certain situations and make you feel better equipped to deal with what life throws your way. It can also help you process the trauma that’s already happened, so you won’t have to spend as much energy blocking it out all of the time. 

Things might seem overwhelming in your situation, I couldn’t imagine going through that much abuse. You are incredibly strong for making it this far. However, I would strongly suggest contacting your treating doctor to talk about therapy options. Not because you need to be fixed, but to make sure the weight of what you’re holding doesn’t overwhelm you later. I know there can be a stigma around therapy, but it really is the best way to make you “mentally stronger”. You have many years ahead of you, and learning these mental coping skills now will allow you to be much healthier and happier in the future."

Like if they say “I’m so mad at my sister; she won’d stop yelling” I’ll respond by saying something along the lines of “yeah I can’t believe she did that” or “I would be angry too if I were in your shoes”. 

Basically just taking their side and validating their feelings can go a long way. Taking sides too strongly can be bad, but you shouldn’t be 100% objective if they just want to vent to you.

Especially for quantitative finance, most people grew up winning math competitions like USAMO/AIME/etc. 

If I were you I’d research these topics, and see if they interest you.

You can use any of the apps like Robinhood or its competitors. They are very easy to use. Investopedia is a great resource. Another beginner option is to invest in brands you know and think have good products and lasting power in industry. Beyond that you will start having to do more extensive research and crunching numbers. For some general tips: don’t invest money that you can’t afford to lose (except in US treasury bonds, but these are pretty illiquid).  Try buying a few different companies instead of going all in on one. You won’t make a ton of money overnight, and you might lose some eventually, but overall investing is super fun and I wish you good luck!"
