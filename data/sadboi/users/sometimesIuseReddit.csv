teenagers,f3ib78u,t1_f3iagh1,1570934448.0,I started early at 14. it was a regrettable experience. I thought i loved him so i made the choice. We were happy for about a year until he became abusive and ended up slapping me in the face. After that i kind of went on a bender and did a lot of random hookups because i was hurt. and definitely ask more questions! I did this to give advice and a lot of people are just memeing the crap out of it. so ask away üòÇ you can PM me too if you want.
teenagers,f3iaou6,t1_f3iaj5r,1570934272.0,hol‚Äô up...
teenagers,f3iame6,t1_f3i89on,1570934248.0,It is important to check your local areas age of consent. Having safe and legal sex is important. Breaking those rules can result in life altering consequences for either you or your partner. Have fun and be safe!

teenagers,f3i8n7q,t1_f3i7is1,1570933572.0,"So basically my ideal range for a penis size is 5-7 inches. Anything larger hurts too bad. Although if i like the guy and he whips out a 4 incher or a 8 incher i‚Äôm not gonna tell him to leave lmao. He was probably around 5.5 and although it didn‚Äôt feel amazing the first time after the next few times it felt even better. Finishing early isn‚Äôt exactly something you can control however wearing condoms (in addition to protection) can prolong the experience. Foreplay is important but don‚Äôt get hung up on the fore part in foreplay. The best guy i slept with would do it before, then stop sex and do oral/manual stimulation on me, finish and then do a little more at the end. 
it‚Äôs all about making your partner feel good as well as yourself. Don‚Äôt neglect it as most guys do!"
teenagers,f3i7mnv,t1_f3i76av,1570933225.0,i love to smoke pot as well lol. but it really ranges from painfully awkward to fun and awesome. it definitely depends on who you‚Äôre with and where. Anyone‚Äôs first time is going to be awkward no matter how you put it. But it does feel really good. hope that answers it.
teenagers,f3i775t,t1_f3i6sqb,1570933080.0,Good question. I am a girl and it was slightly unclear however not nearly as bad as some people say. The dude lasted about two minutes which i wasn‚Äôt upset about in the slightest. it‚Äôs not something anyone can really control.
