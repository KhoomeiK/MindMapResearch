Because I wanted to be eternal, and observe everything that can be, not to get involved in anything, but just observe, from every angle, every perspective. I don't make sense either, but nothing made sense to me as I was growing up. So why should it make any more sense now. I think I have found what I really want, and it's just way out of reach.

Now a positive outlook and constant reminders will work , definitely, for as long as the depressed person has support of a lot of friends and family relatives. But that's never the case. Ugly irritating people, fat, bald and  with no motivation, hardly have any kind of support. And support from a random person on the hotline never helped anyone, if you really look at the stats. So I was wondering how the positive coping strategies work when someone is all alone. No human contact that can provide supportive talk, that is. So how does that person cope with this? Do they have to write it out that they are amazing? Then why did the boss act so violently when the mistake they did, had been done over and over again by other popular employees? Why did his friends keep on belittling him when all he did was something irrelevant years ago? Why do they laugh at the amazing person when he did pitch a rather sensible idea, and finally end up making the same exact decision when pitched by the popular guys. And when he shouts for not being credited for his work, they belittle him even more."

I see that positive thoughts have helped you greatly and I respect that, but imo, depression doesn't come from the negative thoughts, but the things and people surrounding you. And there's a lot of negativity in our society that go unchecked because a large part of them feed off the comparison that they're better off then ""him"" atleast. No matter how positive one maybe, if the way they are treated is unfair, it's natural to be sad about it. If it keeps on happening, it's natural to be irritated. It's natural to be unmotivated.

> Consider the fact countries which are literally right next to the origin point of the virus such as South Korea/Thailand/Taiwan/Vietnam have anywhere between 3x-16x the population density yet nowhere near comparable case numbers.  

So the virus doesn't just jump from nations like that. It depends on influx and outflow of people. And American international airlines are damn busy all the time. Compared to 'Nam and Taiwan.
  
  
So why are you whining? It's not that America is prepared for the virus either, there are holes to be fixed, but people have to acknowledge this is a pandemic that has an edge over all our efforts, because we as humans physically connect to work and make things happen and this virus indirectly effects our social structure and ways of working."

Coronavirus,fnnz8eg,t1_fnnxn6c,1587106456.0,"US is well beyond capable of handling fucked up pandemics. They're failing because this virus is a menace. And partly because some people like partying all the time. But fun facts, the last time I heard any news from Iran and it's response, was early March. We hear about the US everyday, all the decisions made is made public worldwide."

pune,fnnxqyu,t1_fnnvwio,1587105056.0,"I'd try to dual boot but installing win 10 first and then linux is simpler. If you have backup drives, go ahead and do that, it's a drag but manageable. The alternate path is to do this:  

First if you aren't sure of what you are doing, make a backup of your important data. Then you have to follow 3 steps :  



Open GParted and resize your linux partition(s) in order to have at least 20Gb of free space.

Boot on the Windows installation DVD/USB and select ""Unallocated space"" to not override your linux partition(s).

Finally you have to boot on a Linux live DVD/USB to re-install Grub (the boot loader).  

The last step is a few more steps in itself. Feel free to ask just about any tiny details, or just dm me"
