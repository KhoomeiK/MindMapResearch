atheism,evrpc56,t3_cky84o,1564714523.0,"I have to question your knowledge and capability of discussing everything on this list if you believe Christianity isn’t the main religion in Africa. The two main religions that Africans practice are Islam and Christianity. CHRISTIANITY is practiced more in AFRICA. Only a little ass percentage of Africans follow traditional beliefs (sadly due to the scramble of Africa which annihilated most of our religious culture)  which DON’T involve black magic (I say that just incase you’re one of those who believe we do)  If you’re an American, I can probably understand where you’d get the confusion because everyone there thinks we worship voodoo and a bunch of other shit the western media has pumped your minds about Africa with and it’s really fucking annoying. Please, do research. It’s free for fucks sake.

Edit: I see you just edited your post and added “before there were missionaries” Idk if you just did that to save your ass here or if you genuinely meant to put that. Either way Christianity entered Africa due to colonialism from the Europeans by forced conversion, not missionaries."

atheism,evrgul9,t1_evq4uxm,1564708027.0,Maybe because in Islam alone there’s more restrictions and rules for women? Ever thought of that?
