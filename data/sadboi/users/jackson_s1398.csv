I know I could do it if I really buckled down. I guess I’m just weighing out my career choice and still having the opportunity to play professionally. 

My goals not really to play in a symphony or anything. I love the idea of gigging around! :)"

doublebass,etcvgiy,t1_etcutcj,1562693477.0,"My reading is very good. I lack in the ear training department. Thanks for the advice. I guess I’m just trying to see if a degree will really help me that much to reach my musical goals. From reading all of the replies, it seems as if it’s not necessary but helpful in the networking aspect and things of that nature. 

Maybe I’ll just find a teacher and see where the road takes me! Thanks again for the advice."
doublebass,etcuibq,t1_etcthxo,1562692910.0,"If I studied privately rather than holding a degree, would that be similar in terms of the skill set that I could acquire (given I have a good teacher)?"
doublebass,etcu9nr,t1_etcthxo,1562692767.0,As in NYC. I actually studied classical bass with a MSM grad but found classical wasn’t really my niche. Looking to be a versatile bassist.
doublebass,etcs4g3,t1_etcpp9r,1562691485.0,I guess I mean in terms of getting better at the instrument. I agree though.
doublebass,etcs1r8,t1_etcrfl3,1562691441.0,So you don’t necessarily think it’s critical to play professionally? I can definitely see how that networking aspect helps.

doublebass,etckvw8,t1_etck1ox,1562687066.0,Thank you so much for the reply man! I’ve been a classical player all of my life but really want to be diverse and explore jazz. Any recommendations on where to get started? Reading chords is a foreign concept to me!

Bass,essvde4,t3_c938wl,1562258253.0,I’m a classical bassist who just started dabbling in electric for theatre shows. I’d be happy to help you if you have any questions. The transition from upright to electric is way easier than the other way around.

naturalbodybuilding,es9alfz,t1_es94ho3,1561731678.0,"Thanks for the in depth reply man! I should’ve mentioned my numbers at the beginning. My bench is 275 x 5 but am struggling to add weight or even reps for that matter due to cutting. I can dumbbell shoulder press 120 lbs x 6 with strict form coming to about 90 degrees. My squat is rough because I tore my ACL twice and it kills me to squat but I am working past it - it’s only at 225 x 5. Weighted dips are at 90 lbs x 8. I am 6’2 and some change at 245 lbs 16-18 percent body fat. I really wanted to kind of specialize my arms and back since I feel as though they are weak points on my body. My arms measure in at 17 inches but look soooo small compared to the rest of my body :/. I guess I was going more for a specialized phase while I’m cutting because I know I can’t gain much strength while in a deficit?

Do you think I should lower the volume per workout? By the way I agree with everything you said! I’ve seen great progress focusing on the main lifts!"
