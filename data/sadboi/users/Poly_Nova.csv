I’ve made many regrets and mistakes but just remember that mistakes are a learning experience. I’ve made lots of social fuckups and family fuckups but leave it all behind  

If you have toxic family, just remember that you have the right to cut them out of your life, (if you are an adult). If you are being abused, call child protective services. 

All the mistakes you’ve made in the past are building blocks for the future, ive attempted before. Until I learned how to cut people out of my life and keep the good ones tightly. I found myself in hobbies that are beneficial to the future. If you’re in high school, focus on your grades. Seriously. It’ll matter. 

Just remember, you need to filter through the fake assholes and find the people that really care about you, and keep them tightly."

Everytime you start overthinking about the past or future tell your Brain “shut up” or “stop” as soon as you overthink. If it comes back up do it again. I’ve been doing this for a few weeks and it just comes automatically now. I don’t have to tell my brain to Stop it just does and I haven’t overthinked a single thing since.  Hope it helps!
