I was diagnosed with pelvic floor disorder and underwent physical therapy. Some things that helped this particular issue 

* Dilating
* Self massage with wand, especially on this spot (I use a vibrator wand)
* Stopping hormonal birth control (now on copper IUD) has significantly reduced dryness, low sex drive, and sensitivity of the lower vestibule for me
* Myofacial release On dry skin (requires friction to stretch underlying fascia) -- repeatedly drag fingers across skin from vulva to hip bone as I use a wand internally on different tight spots, especially lower vestibule and around opening of vagina.
* Use a professional recommended lube - slippery stuff is the best I know if and I'll never buy another! I have sensitive skin so this is notably better than others I've tried. It only irritates me if I have a tear already.
* Pay attention to the angle of insertion, avoid using angles that Target or irritate the lower vestibule where tearing happens 
* Take a break until the tear heals

Please lmk if you need more details or questions. I do think dry skin (caused largely by hormones for me) is a major cause of this issue. My partners dick is bigger than all my dilators so that's also a cause haha. It's only getting better though! Good luck :)"

* practice relax and contract daily while ""dilating""/manual use of wand (basically help pull perenium down while I inhale and kegel on exhale)
* use wand on any sensitive, tight, or spasmatic spots inside vagina
* myofascial release while using wand on these spots can also help -- basically pull dry skin (requires friction) from vulva to hip bone repeatedly on either side while massaging sensitive spot internally

I don't know about ""parts of some muscles"" or how work could only be done by one portion of your wish for example.

But I have a pelvic floor disorder that led to discovering which muscles I was using incorrectly. Namely glutes, obliques and Transverse Abdominus.

Some muscles are difficult to properly exercise or stretch due to tightness or mobility issues with nearby or said muscles. For example, my quads are to tight to do a proper couch stretch for my hip flexors, so I gotta do other stretches for those and focus on stretching quads more.

Myofascial release (foam roller and manual friction via self massage) has helped me improve mobility as well."

It is more useful than a dilator to me but I have to do it regularly (approx daily) to get real benefit out of it like stretching to become more flexible and alleviate soreness.

I'm basically doing the same thing my PT did during manual stimulation to my pelvic floor but with less pressure because I can't reach my own fingers up in there like she did.

Edit: forgot to mention I also have pain only during pulling out and insertion. My lower vestibule (this skin near perenium and slightly inside as well) is very sensitive. 

The wand even hursts to insert when I haven't used it in awhile because of that spot, so I angle it a bit upwards towards my stomach instead of more towards the anus, and let it vibrate right on that spot at bottom of vulva for a while until it's a little relaxed then probe around the area then a round the entire vagina, esp tight or sensitive spots (gently). Don't go straight up tho because you will hit your urethra and that shit hurts and makes you feel like u gotta pee.


The wand I use is [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Swish-Bgee-Curved-Vibrator-Aqua/dp/B002JVWZ2E) although I don't remember the site I got it.

It's also helped learn to relax the pelvic floor because I can kind of pull my perenium out as I inhale and kegel as I exhale which originally helped get the motion down. I had literally no control or movement during attempted diagrammatic breathing exercises.

Going off hormonal BC has helped a bit with the sensitivity. I read about this here after I decided to quit.

> Vestibulodynia is pain specifically located in the vestibule and is often called provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) and it can be primary or secondary. Typical causes of primary vestibulodynia include neuroproliferative and is present from the first attempt at putting anything into the vagina. Typical causes of secondary can be from long term birth control use (oral contraceptive pills, NuvaRing, depo-provera shot, the patch, and the implant) or history of acne treatments – Accutane or use of Spironolactone. Urologist and sexual medicine specialist Joshua Gonzalez, MD has written a two part blog on how birth control can affect the vulvar tissues called Jagged little Pill: How oral contraceptives wreak havoc on the female body Part 1 and Part 2. PVD can also be due to nerve hypersensitivity from recurrent UTIs or yeast infections.

It's called diaphragmatic breathing. your upper disphragm in your chest cavity moves down/relaxes when you breathe in, which causes your pelvic diaphragm to also expand downwards. Both move upwards/clench/slight kegel when you exhale.

I got a few really helpful tips from my therapist
1. For the breathing, put your hands on different parts of your chest and actively try to push your hands out by expanding your chest. Do it on the front and back. On the sides, etc.
2. Once you can do that ok, do the same thing with your belly. You want the chest and belly to ride in unison not one after the other. Make sure your belly is not an afterthought and vice versa.
3. translating this to relaxing your pelvic floor -- the key for me was to ""breathe into my pelvis"". I imagine my pelvis is like another lung shaped like a bowl and try to fill it up with air. But that just means I'm paying a little more attention to the movement of my breath effecting my pelvic muscles.
4. Your perenium should move when inhaling and exhaling during diaphragmatic breathing.
5. Happy baby position can help you feel this movement and helps open up the muscles. Place your hand on your perenium while in happy baby to feel it more if needed.

Also do stretches for your pelvic floor, hamstrings, piriformis, adductors. I can add more I do later if needed !"

https://douleurchronique.org/diseases/pelvic-pain/vulvodynia-or-pudendal-neuralgia/?lang=en

Additionally I've experienced sciatica starting in my lower back and butt which from further reading could be related or at least shouldn't rule out the pudendal nerve.

I do think a lot of pelvic issues are likely caused by lifestyle issues (lack of exercise, flexibility, mobility, too much sitting, posture) and improving these has helped me with pelvic tightness. But not tissue sensitivity.

>Various musculoskeletal impairments have been associated with pudendal neuralgia, such as pelvic floor dysfunction, connective tissue restrictions, myofascial trigger points, muscle hypertonicity, altered neurodynamics, and structural and biomechanical abnormalities, such as lumbopelvic dysfunctions [25, 26].

I worked on fascial release , trigger points, hypertonicity/stretching and relaxing during and after my time at PT. I was surprised how fascial release helped quite a bit with trigger point release. So for example while dilating, trying to pull skin from your groin to your hip made a notable impact on internal pain during and after. If you foam roll after you work out why not mobilize your pelvic fascia  after too much sitting/activity!

I absolutely recommend mobility stretches and exercises of the pelvic area and back for anyone who's had this issue. I have a lot of weaknesses that I was using my PF to compensate for and learning to use all the surrounding muscles correctly during PT has taken the pressure off my pelvic floor and pelvic organs now that I've begun working that into my daily life.

I haven't found a solution yet for tissue sebstivity, as I still have high sensitivity that doesn't seem muscular or spasmatic."

PelvicFloor,f6vg44d,t1_f6vcc6z,1573185231.0,"Hm. I think you are either medically predisposed to having UTIs due to another condition or just getting the wrong info here.

> There’s a fine line between holding in pee and holding it too long. **Most doctors will recommend going to the bathroom every three to four hours,** except when you’re asleep, to empty your bladder. If you find you have to go a lot more frequently, learning how to hold your pee can help.

> Holding your pee for too long can be harmful for you. It can allow excess bacteria to build up in your bladder and can contribute to urinary tract infections. As a result, it’s important to strike the right balance between going too often and not often enough.

[Here's another scholarly article regarding children ](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C34&q=holding+bladder+uti&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D56PQVvzUWbAJ) showing that <= 3 times per day may contribute in children with overactive bladders can contribute to UTIs. The key is to stretch your bladder by incrementally increasing the time slowly over the course of weeks or months. Assuming 9 hours of sleep, the kids peeing 3 or less times are waiting 5+ hours here.

2 hours is definitely not a long time if it's below the average recommendation. It might be worth looking into your overactive bladder because it can contribute to your tightness and makes life more stressful if you're always looking for a bathroom."

PelvicFloor,f6vb4z0,t1_f6v0ji8,1573181333.0," a helpful bit from my experience -- my PT included a ""potty schedule"" increasing from 1 hour and 15 minutes to eventually 3 hours between peeing. I used to pee 4 times before leaving for work in my 45m morning routine. I'm in my 20s. According to my physicians you should be able to hold your pee comfortable for 3 or more hours. If you cannot, it's really helpful for your comfort now and your continence later to practice holding it (also stretching the bladder and surrounding muscles)  with urge suppression techniques. 

I thought I might have UTIs but I was just really tight in pelvic floor and surrounding muscles and also mentally trained myself to go at the slightest sense of urgency. Having both must make it frustrating and more difficult to self diagnose :/I'm sorry.

~~Can I ask how the PT made you tighter exactly?~~ after reading another of your replies, I see you did relaxing then contracting during your treatment. Did you also increase the amount of stretching and possibly dilating during the last half? If you did stretch more and it didn't help, I'd be glad to try and help brainstorm some stretches that could help with your specific issues of tightness.

I understand contracting being really scary and making it feel worse and it's easy to overdo it by going too quickly or too hard/suddenly. I'm still working on strengthening and I take breaks between sessions atm to make sure i don't get too tight."

PelvicFloor,f6i5war,t3_draokl,1572872616.0,"Your anus shouldn't sag too much extra but it should drop alongside your perennial body.

Your pelvic floor is in use the most during activities that use your lower body or core. In order from most active to least:

1 - walking/exercising
2 - standing
3 - sitting (especially if sitting up straight)
4 - lying down, almost unused

I think you should allow your pelvic floor to remain in use (don't try to turn it off/relax completely when it's needed).

I've been going to PT because my pelvic floor is maybe at 30% engagement when it should be relaxed. I think I've knocked that down 5-10% so far. A lot of what I've been working on includes contractions and not just relaxation. It's important to understand how to relax but not necessArily to do it 24/7 and never kegel. I use my TA for static and dynamic exercises and breathing techniques, as well as using TA with kegels and reverse kegels."

vaginismus,f5lbuud,t3_do3ap3,1572276552.0,"I've always been more into ""outercourse"". I see it as pretty much all foreplay before PIV, especially P on V. It's really fun and exciting to tease each other.

One thing I would do when avoiding sex (bc partner is too large for comfort at the time) is use a smaller dilator/dildo on myself after or during foreplay. If I'm doing so without any pain then i might let him control it as well with instructions from me (not too fast, keep this angle, more lube, etc.)

I think your therapist is giving good advice. I do think that orgasming with something (especially a partner) inside of me feels much more pleasurable and intimate, but I think it's important to be able to mix it up and do more than just PIV because that may not always be a viable option. A few examples would be switching birth controls and waiting for it to take effect, forgetting a condom, or my partner or myself has dysfunction that temporarily makes it difficult or impossible.

I've found that my sexual dysfunction can bring along many negative emotions regarding sex like ""it hurts but I wanna do it to make him happy and because I enjoy it""...but in that case I'm lying to myself because while I enjoy the thought of PIV and the closeness it brings, it's painful and making things worse by tearing, causing unseen distress and conditioning pain reactions for later encounters. 

More importantly,  if you are having sex that is painful and emotionally distressing for the sake of your partner's sexual pleasure, not only would a good partner not want you to do that, but you are putting yourself down and putting your partners wants (not needs) above yours. I think this is the most damaging thought process that  comes along with vaginismus and it's important to recognize it when you fall into that thinking.

I don't think PIV is the holy Grail that it's often made out to be. I recommend trying as many kinds of sexual experiences as you can that are not PIV because it can give more meaning to physical intimacy, it's really fun to explore and it will raise your confidence and interest in sexy time. Off the top of my head I can think of massage, showers/baths, oral (although still sex), naked chores, porn, and mutual masturbation (either helping or watching each other). If you're interested in trying some new kinks then maybe role play, BDSM, exhibitionism, remote vibrators...don't be afraid to be silly.

Your therapist may already have suggested this but I highly recommend trying Sensate Focus Therapy. Here is a [comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/sexover30/comments/7tc76w/sensate_focus_therapy_for_mismatched_libidos_also/dtealjx?utm_source=reddit-android) I really liked and here is an [article explaining the process](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://health.cornell.edu/sites/health/files/pdf-library/sensate-focus.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjn8qKcor_lAhVth-AKHbGeAosQFjABegQIBhAB&usg=AOvVaw0VTYzNsuGbCYDsOlFr1IZa&cshid=1572276484773).

PelvicFloor,f4bpbo6,t1_f4b3nnj,1571516262.0,"I have not experienced leakage but it's possible. I've been in pelvic therapy for a few months and here's a quick overview of what I've learned so far:

The pelvic floor has 3 primary muscles which are often referred to as later 1, 2, and 3. 1 is the most shallow/closest to your anus so think the perenium and right inside the anus (for females, right inside the vagina).

The core also has 3 primary muscles groups, obliques and the transverse abdominis/TA. The TA should your first line of command for all stabilization or pelvic and abdominal exercises like sitting, standing, leg lifts, clams, etc.

Your pelvic floor can become too tight, too weak, and also develop a lack of coordination.

In my case, I have overused my pelvic floor by flexing all surrounding muscles when doing lower body or ab-centric exercises to the point that it was tight all the time and I could not relax it. This can cause constipation, GI issues, frequent urination, pain during sex, etc. I think it can cause painful erections as well IIRC from other posts on this sub.

So far, I've worked on diaphragmatic breathing, pelvic floor relaxation and contraction with breathing, TA control with breathing and exercises, and lots of stretches for my PF and surrounding muscle groups. Myofascial release around my pelvis has also helped quite a bit (literally tugging my skin to provide some friction between fascially connected muscles. I can now hold my pee for 3 hours instead of 20 min and experience little to no pain on a daily basis. On a potty schedule right now actually to practice stretching the bladder and fortunately I'm young enough that I've progressed quickly through the stages, if I continue with maintaining a somewhat regular schedule and stretching bladder I will be less likely to have incontinence as I get older.

However, lack of coordination of PF and surrounding muscles could mean that you have poor relaxation and contraction control. So while you may be able to kegel really hard, it could be uncontrolled and spastic. It's important for your pelvic health to learn how to contract and relax smoothly and in a controlled fashion so that you can avoid pelvic disorders especially into old age.

Hopefully a good overview, lmk if you have any questions. I do recommend PT even though as a male if you have too much tightness you'll likely need manual pressure release through your anus bc that's the easiest entry way. As a woman I have easier access to all layers of my pelvic floor so I can do most of the manual work with a dilator at home. I imagine this is somewhat true for males as well but may require more coordination and training, don't try it without a doctor."
PelvicFloor,f4b3fnf,t1_f4amxv2,1571506115.0,"It's important to contract and lengthen with coordination. You're doing a kegel/contraction. Working on one without the other can become an issue that leads to PFD.

It also helps to stretch and know how to indovodually fire all surrounding muscles so you are not accidentally using pelvic floor instead of glutes/hams/TA/etc. or vice versa during any sort of resistance workouts or daily activities like walking and standing up ."
PelvicFloor,f3xko1c,t1_f3xecoe,1571239860.0,"I understand discouragement. I feel shitty every time I try working on pelvic relaxation bc I can't actually feel the movement without touching the pereniem and it barely moves :(

Sitting takes pressure off the pelvic floor (and all core muscles) compared to standing, and lying down you're pretty much not using any of them so that probably does help a lot!

I think stretching consistently has helped me the most bc I used to hardly be able to pee or go to sleep or relax at all bc of tightness and it's only like that when I don't stretch now."

costochondritis,f3sshmb,t1_f3sfhvk,1571108369.0,"I love using a health journal. Since you're struggling with mental health you might also like a mood app like Daylio or Pixels. It's really nice and comforting to be able to look back and see your highs and lows in color and realize the feelings you have in one moment don't last forever.

I understand you're worries, it's awkward to talk about mental health with friends. If you have a semi close relationship with someone who is nice it might be good to just mention depression so you know they know. It can also make you closer

Anxiety and stress management has helped me immensely along with stretching and eating better. Strength training too but that's a lot harder to do when depressed so it varies.

One thing that I've found helpful while getting treatment for a (possibly related) disorder of my pelvic floor is that all your core muscles and fascia are pretty closely connected. I've had diaphragmatic pressure point release that was so excruciating I thought they were stabbing my lung. But the physical therapy for my pelvic floor focuses on breathing and proper muscle contraction which in turn seemed to help my costo and psiatic nerve pains.

Anxiety and costo are both horrible and set each other off :( I hope you find some relief soon!"

nutrition,f3hfk9p,t3_dgynby,1570922959.0,"IANAD and this is from my memory but Google microbiota on the scholarly search if you want sources :)

Short answer is variety is better.

The amount and variety of your intestinal microbiota is very closely related to your diet and exercise habits as well as some other factors like she and antibiotic use.

Since this bacteria is responsible for breaking down all types of food that you eat, it's important to eat a variety to maintain gut health because it's very closely linked with your nervous system and mind. See fecal transplants.

If you were to only eat fries and chicken nuggets for an extended amount of time you would likely lose various families of bacteria that were previously breaking down veggies and fruits for you. This can lead to inflammation when reintroducing other foods, stress on the nervous system due to lack of fiber (etc). Maintaining a healthy gut microbiome through diet and exercise is a common factor in the blue zones and is considered one of the best ways to prevent future diseases which are not yet fully understood like diabetes, Alzheimer's."

I think nonbinary woman (maybe demigirl sometimes) would be the best label for me at the moment.

I don't really want to change my pronouns because I don't like drawing attention to myself and I don't mind being called a women, she, her, etc. I think I strive to be more andro so that I can express all parts of myself more freely instead of feeling ashamed of more masculine coded clothes or hobbies or whatever else I might enjoy. I like the asthetic I've started to move towards, I feel more ""me"" and less fake. Somehow my feelings are like that too but idk how to express it as much?

However I do have instances where when I'm called she or her I feel really uncomfortable all of a sudden. Idk if it's a safety, surprise, dysphoria, I think it's just confusion haha. For example, I was gaming with some friends when one of them said ""she"" referring to me and I commented on how weird it was. That could be because I'm used to people calling me a dude most of the time unless I speak up (which I'm mostly scared to do).

I have a fair amount of genital issues for a woman my age but I like having female body parts. However I despise being a slave to my uterus due to anti abortion states, so IUD for me. 

I think the closest thing to dysphoria I have felt is regarding my boob size. I'm about a 34/36 A and I used to wear push up bras all the time bc I felt too small and not feminine enough. Now I really like my wide shoulders and small chest bc it makes me look more athletic and more andro. Now I feel uncomfortable when I wear push up bras and esp hate when I catch people looking. I think I would be uncomfortable in public if my boobs were much larger.

On others perception of your gender, I really like Rebecca Sugars explanation of her own gender identity [here](https://www.pride.com/comingout/2018/7/18/rebecca-sugar-opens-about-being-non-binary). I definitely vibe with this. I don't necessarily think of myself as a woman but I don't mind being perceived this way. Also, since I experience life as a woman due to others  perception of me it really shapes the experiences I identify with especially w.r.t. gaming and working in tech.

Idk how to sum all that up but I hope it made sense!"

PelvicFloor,f22ucax,t1_f22jb6m,1569897246.0,"Using a tennis ball on the pereneum can help with anything immediate (myofacial) release similar to foam rolling sore muscles after strength training.

Heat is better than ice since you have trouble relaxing and the muscle is therefore contracted. Heat expands :)

Those stretches I mentioned done 2+ times a day, 30s each x 3 (with rest between) should help a lot. I forgot to add child's pose!! That should open up the pelvic floor a bit like happy baby.

Sitting takes pressure off the pelvic floor versus standing.

Don't struggle too much correct posture because you could overuse connective muscles like core, butt, hips, etc which cause you to inadvertently tighten pelvic floor. So ease into posture correction, upper body strength training can help a lot so that you naturally rest your shoulders in a more upright position. I'd wait to work hard on the butt and core until you get that mind muscle connection a little better so you don't overstrain. 

Since you mentioned nofap, one thing that helps a lot is don't flex at all. Don't flex your butt, your thighs, belly, or anything. Orgasm is a rhythmic contraction of pelvic floor muscles so it probably doesn't hurt to stop altogether but if you find muscular release or relaxation it may be worth trying. IMO it feels better if you don't flex to reach climax!

Related to that, one thing I've recently learned is that the pelvic floor muscles can become so tight that they spasms in response to stimulation. So if you were to provide pressure to tight spots then it may spasm a bit directly afterwards or later during the day when you engage those muscles i.e. while walking.  If that happens no worries, if it's during manual stimulation then ease up on the speed, then maybe ease up the amount of pressure.

If you have trouble with bladder suppression I have some  tips for that, lmk."
