To me it's just as plausible as China unintentionally or intentionally releasing the virus on their own people.

Not to mention a long history of experimenting on populations around the world and their own citizens. I don't think we can definitively say who was responsible. The US is currently also trying to ramp up contempt for China through media, and I'm not buying into it personally.

Let's also not forget all of the donations and connections from people like Bill Gates and Fauci, etc to that Wuhan lab in particular.

First: I think covid-19 is real. I think there has been a huge overreaction to it (but maybe the reaction is not overreacting, possibly because it may be a bioweapon, but those that would know aren't giving us that info). As the days go by and more information comes out, the more I believe it is akin to a severe flu - which is deadly to those with pre-existing conditions and weaker immune systems. A lot of countries are over the peak of the virus and have begun to function again, which is good news.

The numbers recorded seem to have been inflated all over the place. Italy came out saying that only 12% of their recorded deaths are a result of covid. The CDC gave a directive on March 24 stating that all cases of death in patients with covid should be labeled a covid death if unsure. Hospitals also have incentives to drive up numbers to receive more funding and equipment. Many's budgets have been slashed in the years running up to this. 

Second: The 5G directly causing covid is dumb and more misinfo. But there have been scientific communities coming out against its implementation because it could be harmful with its higher levels of EMF radiation. Governments are fast tracking the 5G systems without proper testing into their health effects and so people are obviously upset about this. There should be testing done to prove it is not harmful before implementation."
