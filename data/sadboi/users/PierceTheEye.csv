AskAChristian,fr2erdy,t3_gm6z9p,1589836009.0,"We are created as eternal beings as the image of God and as God is perfectly holy and good he will judge us by his holy standards. We cannot ""die"" in a way that we would cease to exist (**Ecclesiastes 3:11)**.Every evil thought of our heart is weighted and measured. That is simply the nature of God. He is love, peace, justice, joy, the supreme being and the creator of the universe. And he HATES evil and sin BECAUSE he is GOOD and HOLY. His wrath no being can stand (hell). We are offered an eternity in his kingdom as being who will ""judge angels"". This is a great honor, especially considering there are other races in the Universe but only one that has been created in the image of the most high Creator. But since we have free will we have the opportunity to follow the lies of Satan/Lucifer that lead us straight into hell. God is extremely patient withholding his wrath giving people multiple chances to repent and get saved through Jesus. Unfortunately, many people reject Jesus and us Christians need to do everything we can so that as many souls as possible may be saved.

God is really good to us. He blesses us every day and gives us free will. What do people do? They do drugs, get drunk, fornicate, commit adultery, murder, lie, steal, gossip, and commit many other evil atrocities in their hearts and deeds. People reject salvation and the plan of salvation by God every day, choosing their fleshly lusts over the holy spirit of God. We are spiritually infected by sin and our fleshly nature. And Jesus came so that we may have the holy spirit to combat sin and crucify our fleshly nature. No evil deed goes unpunished in hell.

E: Do not listen to some other replies in this thread. Hell is ABSOLUTE TORTURE. The bible clearly teaches it is eternal as well. It is worse than anything you could imagine taking place on Earth. There are simply no words to describe it. There are multiple books and testimonies of hell by people who have been there are those that come back are shaken to their core of how horrible hell is."

No worries. Just imagine if you had a supernatural experience and having to go through the trouble to convey it. These experiences can happen to anyone.

> so if a non christian had an nde in which they met vishnu or allah, would that make you join their religion? do you also think people who claim to have been abducted by aliens to be credible?

When it comes to NDEs of hell, it is Jesus who saves from there, never visnu or allah, so there's consistency. I haven't found any NDEs where people are saved from hell by either of these, or any other person than Jesus no matter the religious background of a person. But I'd be happy to  look into some if you find them.

I think it is foolish to dismiss strong personal testimonies of people just because they do not happen to fit into one's worldview. Especially when it's the kind of information that would make these people being perceived as ""crazy"" and these people know it. Yet these people still make the choice to come publicly forth and tell about their experiences. How many people are there who never share their experiences out of fear? When it comes to NDEs, various people have described demons masquerading as angels or beings of light in order to trick people. So it's another thing to keep in mind."

He does treat all with love while people are alive. When they are death, most people are subjected to his wrath for eternity.

His treatment of sinners feels cruel beyond measure. It makes sense that you are afraid to question God. You have grown to trust in God's goodness, yet deep down you feel that what he does is wrong. Raising these questions feels like it puts you in danger of that same wrath and cruelty that so disturbs you. That is a really hard position to be in.

""Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life, and only a few find it."" -Matthew 7:13

God is reaching out to every person who is still alive so that they would choose him and the narrow path through Jesus. 

Here's how I think about it. Whatever I think about God's justice doesn't change the reality of hell. It doesn't matter if I don't like the idea of hell and/or God. The Bible warns us of it, Jesus talked about it, there are numerous books written by people who have been there and come back, not to mention all the testimonies on Youtube. There are too many testimonies to ignore based on emotional reasons, like feeling angry or uncomfortable. And I'm saying this as someone who is afraid of hell himself.

I've had tremendous issues with this question. I've been very angry and yelling in agony. But whatever I think doesn't change the Truth and I certainly will not take the risk of suffering for eternity let alone not warning people of it. I pray that God will reach more people with visions and experiences of hell. Like the guy on this video on a playlist with nearly 300 first hand testimonies of hell:

And also Matthew 7:22. ""Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’ Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness!’""

So you can be a true Christian performing miracles in Jesus's name and still many people like this will end up in hell? What's the point?

If nothing is impossible to God why can't God save people from hell after they have been tormented there for a period of time? Eternal torture is beyond cruel.

Also, this is the most often posted biblical response, the whole chapter is about the impartiality of God (Romans 2, Amplified Bible version):

Therefore you have no excuse or justification, everyone of you who [hypocritically] [a]judges and condemns others; for in passing judgment on another person, you condemn yourself, because you who judge [from a position of arrogance or self-righteousness] are habitually practicing the very same things [which you denounce]. 2 And we know that the judgment of God falls justly and in accordance with truth on those who practice such things. 3 But do you think this, O man, when you judge and condemn those who practice such things, and yet do the same yourself, that you will escape God’s judgment and elude His verdict? 4 Or do you have no regard for the wealth of His kindness and tolerance and patience [in withholding His wrath]? Are you [actually] unaware or ignorant [of the fact] that God’s kindness leads you to repentance [that is, to change your inner self, your old way of thinking—seek His purpose for your life]? 5 But because of your callous stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are [deliberately] storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed. 6 He will pay back to each person according to his deeds [justly, as his deeds deserve]: 7 to those who by persistence in doing good seek [unseen but certain heavenly] glory, honor, and immortality, [He will give the gift of] eternal life. 8 But for those who are selfishly ambitious and self-seeking and disobedient to the truth but responsive to wickedness, [there will be] wrath and indignation. 9 There will be tribulation and anguish [torturing confinement] for every human soul who does [or permits] evil, to the Jew first and also to the Greek, 10 but glory and honor and inner peace [will be given] to everyone who habitually does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. 11 For God shows no partiality [no arbitrary favoritism; with Him one person is not more important than another].

12 For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish without [regard to] the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged and condemned by the Law. 13 For it is not those who merely hear the Law [as it is read aloud] who are just or righteous before God, but it is those who [actually] obey the Law who will be [b]justified [pronounced free of the guilt of sin and declared acceptable to Him]. 14 When Gentiles, who do not have the Law [since it was given only to Jews], do [c]instinctively the things the Law requires [guided only by their conscience], they are a law to themselves, though they do not have the Law. 15 They show that the [d]essential requirements of the Law are written in their hearts; and their conscience [their sense of right and wrong, their moral choices] bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or perhaps defending them 16 on that day when, [e]as my gospel proclaims, God will judge the secrets [all the hidden thoughts and concealed sins] of men through Christ Jesus.

I don't think it is possible to see this unless you are born again (John 3).

http://web.mit.edu/jywang/www/cef/Bible/NIV/NIV_Bible/JOHN+3.html

The bible talks about the being ""spiritually blind"" when one hasn't been born again (which is a requirement for salvation). I personally was I fundamentalistic Christian years 5-20 and deconverted and reconverted at 29 (now). There's a clear difference when you are away from faith and sinning without repenting because you become ""spiritually dead"" (emptiness) and ""spiritually blind"". The best way to describe is that when you live in sin and are not born again you are spiritually numb and desensitized to spiritual matters and cannot sense that realm. 

https://www.openbible.info/topics/spiritual_blindness

What does it look like to me? I 'see' people differently and sense if they have the holy spirit within them (which feels like purity, clarity, truth, light, whiteness and power) within the ""aura"" of a person. I see people destroying themselves in sin and being prisoners to their ""flesh"" and the ""deeds of the flesh"" (immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing etc.). It's like an addiction they cannot break no matter how much they strife to be ""good"". God is the very definition of ""good"" and he is also ""holy"", the latter which can be understood as an infinitely high level of morality. God is concerned with the state of the human heart above everything else. Since that is the ""core"" of the spirit and where everything comes from. Since God is love, I see love through people trying to bring them to God, Jesus and salvation. You became sensitized to these matters, because they are all that matter. Your sight is not on earthly things but on the kingdom of God and eternity. You notice ""sin"" easily, in yourself and others, are very sensitive to it in a way that you dislike it. You see people being offered endless opportunities to accept Jesus as their savior and receive the help that they need and the power of God to change their lives around. Over and over. You also sense in the ""spirit"" how people are incredibly opposed to ""God"" and the name of ""Jesus"" and see them reacting in weird ways. Deep down, in ""spirit"" level everyone knows God is real. For example I had a friend and I playfully mentioned the name of Jesus in our conversation and her expression changed and she whispered in this strange tone ""Jesus is NOT my friend"" as if it had been someone else speaking through her. The demonic entities are affecting and tormenting people all the time deceiving them away from salvation, because these entities want as many people to end up in hell as possible."

When I worked on healing BPD with my ex what helped me immensely was the concept of the ""inner child"". This ""inner child"" has been traumatized very early on (ages 0-2) and this has caused the emotional development to be stunned. So emotionally, people with BPD carry this traumatized child within them. They are often too dissociated, depressed or numb to emotionally connect with this child or recognize it, and unfortunately their internalized adult aspect continues the cycle of self-abuse. Whenever BPD symptoms appear it means that emotionally, the inner child is re-experiencing the original abandonment trauma and/or is anticipating the threat of it. This is the model I've used in my own healing process with great success and [I've made also some videos talking on this subject.](https://youtu.be/lGDIKEHxTfw) Healing BPD is connecting with this inner child by facing difficult, painful emotions and providing this inner child security and comfort. This is controversial, but my ex literally babied me as I would regress emotionally to the times when I was hit or abandoned as an infant. It helped heal a lot of the deep emotional pain I had. This traumatized inner child is the core and seed of the healthy personality, but since it's so ""small"" and vulnerable, [BPD people also often have a ""narcissistic shell"" that often resembles the parent's narcissistic traits.](https://youtu.be/w2kTDMyy0no) Narcissism is merely a defense mechanism to protect the vulnerable true self."

""Menimme kohti niitä helvetin portteja. Ystävät, syvä pimeys ympäröi ja tuoksu oli niin hirvittävä että tuskin saatoin hengittää. Tunnelin ympärillä oli erilaisia olemuksia. Tunnelin sisältä kuului kauhea melu ja huuto. Ystävä, jos Jeesus ei olisi ollut mukanani, en olisi tänään voinut kertoa tätä sinulle.

Nämä pahat henget olivat valmiit menemään ympäri maapalloa. Ilkeä nauru ja kuoleman melu oli tukahduttavan hirvittävä. Minulla oli kaikki aistit ja olin hengen olemuksessa.

Totisesti, Herralla on kaikki valta taivaassa ja maassa. Ystävät, tämä ei ole kaunista mitä tulen kertomaan. Hirvittävä melu ja valitus kuului tunnelin päässä. Pelko, kuolema ja tuska olivat kaikkialla ja myös palanneen lihan tuoksu. En ole milloinkaan kokenut maailmassa mitään niin hirvittävää. Edessämme oli rajualaisia myrskyjä. Liekkien leimahdukset näkyivät pimeydessä. Isoja käärmeitä nousi ylös maapallosta. Huutoja kaikui tunnelista.

Helvetti, sanoi Jeesus, on myös maan päällä syntisten ihmisten luona. Samoin kuin Jumalalla on ruumis, joka koostuu Häneen uskovista, niin on myös helvetin ruumis olemassa maanpäällä uskomattomien ihmisten sydämissä. Helvettiä ei luotu ihmisille vaan paholaiselle ja hänen enkeleilleen.

Jeesus sanoi että nyt mennään helvetin sisäpuolelle. Edessämme oli sellainen suru, masennus ja kauhu. Pahuus kaikessa muodossa kaikkien sielujen keskellä.

Minä annan sinulle voiman ja varjeluksen kun kuljemme helvetin läpi. Paljon siitä mitä tulet näkemään, tulee pelastamaan monia ihmisiä joutumasta tänne. Tämä on todellista. Älä pelkää sillä minä tulen olemaan kanssasi koko ajan, en koskaan tule sinua jättämään.

Me kuljimme eteenpäin. Pimeydestä sielut ojensivat kätensä kohti Jeesusta. Me kävelimme kohti helvetin vasenta puolta tunnelista. Jeesus oli kuin aurinko ja loisti aina kirkkaammin mitä enemmän synkeys kasvoi. Jeesus sanoi, Isä on puhunut, meidän täytyy totella. Jeesus sanoi myös että sinulla on kaikki aistit sielussasi helvetissä.

Pelkoa oli joka puolella ja kaikenlaisia vaaroja. Joka askel oli kauhistuttava kun kävelimme kohti ensimmäistä kuoppaa. Veljet ja sisaret, niin kauaksi kuin näin tällä osuudella, siellä oli tulikuoppia toistensa jälkeen. Jokainen kuoppa oli noin 75 cm syvä ja noin 90 cm leveä. Tulipunaiset kivet peittivät kuoppien seinät.

Ystävä, minä rukoilen että Jumalan Henki saisi koskettaa sinua kun sinä luet tätä ja että et koskaan unohda että juuri tänä päivänä on helvetissä sieluja, jotka ovat eläneet täällä maapallon päällä aikaisemmin. Minä rukoilen, jos olet syntinen, ole kiltti ja tee parannus. tule Jeesuksen luo ja anna Hänen pelastaa sinut.

Kävelimme kohti ensimmäistä kuoppaa. Kuulin sieltä erään sielun huutavan.

Jeesus, armahda minun sieluani.

Kauhuissani huomasin hänen olevan nainen joka puhui. Palavaa lihaa oli hänen ruumiissaan. Tässä ihmiset, oli hukkaan joutunut sielu joka oli joutunut helvettiin. Hän oli kuin ruumis ja hänen sisäpuolella oli harmaan näköinen hahmo, se oli hänen sielunsa. Joka puolella hänen ruumiissa oli roikkuvia harmaan kuoleman värisiä lihaksia jotka olivat vaurioituneet. Tuli alkoi hänen jaloistaan ja eteni ylöspäin hänen ruumiissaan. Ruumis paloi koko ajan, jatkuvasti. Hän ojensi kätensä kohti Jeesusta.

Oi Jumala armahda huusin. Tulenliekit kohosivat välillä ylös ja polttivat hänen kasvojaan. Katselin tätä kauhuissani. Koko hänen olemuksensa vapisi siinä kun hän huusi. Hän oli joutunut kadotukseen ilman paluuta, ikuisesti hukkaan helvettiin. Herra Jeesus, minä huusin, miten kauheata on olla helvetissä.Niin kauaksi kuin näin, siellä oli tuhansia palavia sieluja helvetin liekeissä. Sielut eivät päässeet ulos vankiloista, näytti siitä että tämä luurangon näköinen ruumis oli heidän vankilansa. Silti he pystyivät puhumaan ja liikkumaan, myös he olivat tietoisia siitä mitä tapahtui heidän ympärillä. Raamatussa puhutaan rikkaasta miehestä ja Lasaruksesta, miten tämä rikas mies näki ja puhui helvetissä. Siitä huolimatta elämä jatkuu maan päällä, monet jotka kuolevat joutuvat helvettiin tänä päivänä.

Kuljimme polkua pitkin seuraavaan kuopan luo. Palavia käsiä ojentui kohti Jeesusta. Sielut huusivat armahdusta. Tulimme kuopalle jossa oli miespuolinen sielu.

Jeesus armahda minua, olen niin pahoillani Jeesus, anna minulle anteeksi. Ota minut pois täältä, olen ollut täällä jo monia vuosia. Minä rukoilen Sinua, anna minun päästä pois täältä.

Miehen ulkomuoto oli paljon edellisen sielun näköinen. Hän jatkoi huutoaan pyytäen apua ja armoa. Mies itki niin voimakkaasti että koko hänen olemuksensa vapisi.

Jeesus, enkö ole jo tarpeeksi saanut kärsiä synneistäni, olen ollut jo täällä 40 vuotta.

Jeesus sanoi; On kirjoitettu. Vanhurskas on elävä uskosta. Ilveilijät ja epäuskoiset saavat osansa palavassa meressä. Sinä et uskonut totuuteen. Monta kertaa sinun luoksesi tuli ihmisiä joiden tehtävä oli osoittaa sinulle tie, mutta sinä et kuunnellut heitä. Sinä nauroit ja torjuit evankeliumin. Sinä teit Herraa naurettavaksi etkä tehnyt parannusta synneistäsi. Minun isäni antoi sinulle mahdollisuuden toisensa jälkeen palvella Minua, mutta sinä kieltäydyit. Minun henkeni annettiin sinun puolestasi ristillä, vaan et kääntynyt puoleeni, etkä antanut elämäsi Minulle. Minun vereni vuosi sinun tähtesi että olisit pelastunut tästä kauheasta paikasta. Jos olisit vain kuunnellut sanoi Jeesus. Ja Jeesus itki!"""

What do you mean by this?

Accepting the reality of Hell has been the most difficult thing for me to accept, and now that I have and I need to warn people about it's reality before it is too late for them. God wants to save everyone from Hell and that is why Jesus talked about it so much. I spent 10 years dabbling in the occult and new age searching for answers and came back to Christianity because it was the only thing that was true. ""Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up"". The Bible is very much sufficient in order for man to gain wisdom and everything they need to know to connect with God personally and start walking on the narrow path of salvation. satan is the god of this world according the bible and he ""deceiveth the whole world"" with his lies. Unless you have the Holy Spirit of God you cannot see through his lies and deception, because the web of lies is so immense. That is why it is not good to gather knowledge outside of the Bible, as the Bible is the only source that accurately identifies ""Lucifer/Satan"" for who he is: father of lies and a murderer. If you do not serve the God of the bible, you serve satan. If you do not possess the holy spirit (that battles against the flesh), you possess the spirit of the antichrist. Your handle has ""666"" probably as a joke, but do you know the real meaning of the number of the beast? God is a triune being (father, son, spirit) and we are created in his image. 666 is man in beast consciousness in thought, emotion and action because without God's holy spirit and the blood of Jesus man is but a beast. 777 is when we are completely filled with God's holy spirit and overcome flesh and it's desires completely. This is the one and only true spiritual path. So many people, like myself in the past, are supposed to be on a ""spiritual"" path but there is no true good spiritual fruit in their lives, because they haven't confessed their sins and received God's holy spirit. That's what real, tangible spirituality is about."

Parannuksen tekeminen on oleellista pelastumisen kannalta, ja Jumala antaa tähänkin voiman niille jotka sydämestään etsivät häntä ja katuvat syntejään. Olemme kaikki spirituaalisia olentoja joille Jumala antoi lahjana ikuisen elämän.

AskAChristian,fp57khf,t3_gbdpjk,1588319063.0,"Oh this is a great question and I'd love to answer it! I grew up in a devout pentacostal Christian household and my father is a pastor. The problem was that I was badly abused as a child and a big part of my abuse was religious abuse. When you abuse your children, emotionally, sexually and physically it opens them up for subsequent trauma. You cannot abuse an infant religiously, but a child of 4-5 you can. So I grew up with a terrible fear of Hell as a child because the violence I went through literally started when I was born, e.g. my mother would physically hit me as an infant and it affected me neurologically and psychologically. Admist of all this abuse I prayed to Jesus to help me as a child and he did, I was filled with the Holy Spirit and it was God that helped me endure all the abuse. Later in my life I went through a 10-year period in my life where I abandoned my faith completely, only to come back eventually because a relationship with Jesus is the best thing I ever experienced and losing it hurt me.

So here's the thing. You have to first differentiate between abuse and indoctrination. They are not the same. Secondly, EVERY person goes through a period of ""growing out"" of the childlike faith in their teens. It's part of our natural process. So this is the time when many Christians deconvert and some come back later. So I'd say, as long as you truly love your child and treat them well and don't abuse them, I don't see how indoctrination could be harmful. Because if your child has basic security in the world, they will be able to question whatever you've taught them later in their life. Furthermore, a Christian upbringing can often provide a good safe network for a growing child as far as morals are concerned. Meaning, no alcohol, no drugs, no premarital sex etc. This can protect the child and the teen from a lot of future damage for example in a way of drug addiction."
