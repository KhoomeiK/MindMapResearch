AMPED!! The amped perk is amazing with this weapon. It makes the lock on time quicker as well as reload speed.

Of course you can’t expect to go positive using the joker alone, that’s why it’s a secondary. It might be hard to lock on to a target because you’re standing out in the open, but the damage radius of it is crazy big so you can just lock on to anything near where you’re trying to shoot."
