SuicideWatch,eyw3y4c,t3_cz474w,1567520277.0,"1. Just grow up is not advice. Yes the OP should make an effort to change his situation/seek help. Talking to someone will help. Depression causes disinterest, laziness, apathy and makes dealing with everyday tasks very hard. But make the effort to talk to someone. Especially because as a student there is at the very least someone at your school you could talk to. Easy to walk in and ask for help even for the laziest of us. 

2. His statements about not wanting to face growing up is just an adolescent form of depression. It sounds immature but he said he’s in high school. Childhood depression is different. 

3. How is him saying he doesn’t want a job/school/adult responsibilities any different than the 30 year old guy too depressed to work, can’t get out of bed, self medicating with alcohol or drugs, and failing to complete adult functions. Depression manifests in different ways. 

4. I don’t believe the individual responding is providing tough love. I think that they are manifesting their own ideals of what makes someone consider suicide. If the anxiety and “impending doom” is affecting this young individual this way then its not for someone to call his feelings invalid."

Vaping101,etzjbfy,t1_etyysmv,1563332578.0,Yes. 3 strength. Mixing for lower levels is an excellent idea. A 0 mixed with a 3 gives you .15 or so. This can be a good starting point. You don’t want to get sick because you overdid it.
Vaping101,etyvbqi,t3_ce4ho3,1563323207.0,I’m going to make one suggestion. If you are attempting to use vaping to quit cigarettes I’m going to pass on the best advice I ever got. It doesn’t apply to everyone obviously but it really helped me. I’d try to quit three times with different pens/mods/sticks/juul you name it. But I always went for a menthol flavor. Within a week or two I was back to cigs. Nothing could recreate the taste of my favorite cigarettes. I told myself I’d give it one more shot because I swore I’d quit before I turned 30 (in couple of months). I went to a vape shop owned by an old friend and she told me: Stop trying to recreate menthol or tobacco flavors. They are never going to be the same. Get something fruity or sweet whatever you like. The point is to make it better than smoking. And she was right. I’ve been off cigs for 2 months. I was a light smoker with about a pack a day of camel menthol crush lights. And I use a 3 strength nic level. The lower nic level allows me to take longer hits and vape for a longer period of time without feeling gross. I could probably use a 6 but it can go bad very fast if I over do it. I got a drag 2 because I liked all the modes and control it gave me to get exactly the airy cool vape I wanted and I’ve stayed away from menthol and tobacco flavors. They just make me want a real cig. Now I’d rather have my vape than a cig because the taste.  I use a falcon king tank and get amazing flavor. Good luck.
