Ex. under confidence, I could write that I liked my outfit or that I feel like i prepared well for class. Under proud, I could write that I got a compliment on my cooking! 

When I feel bad, I can’t seem to think of the good things about myself. This helps.

I’m starting medication somewhere in the next few months to help me focus and to help me get my life back on track. I have a really great best friend now who helps me out a lot. I want to get back into my studies because I’m really far behind and my motivation is coming back, the energy and focus is still lacking. 

I really hope 2020 will be the year where I can function in a healthy, structured way, getting out of bed in the morning. Going through my day as any other person. Hanging out with friends AND doing homework. Studying for my tests AND getting a healthy amount of sleep and eating regularly.
