Codependency,fizak3k,t3_fancmu,1582858040.0,"Hello!  It’s a huge first step to put all of these thoughts into words and be this self-aware at 20 years old.  At 20, I was knee deep in my first codependent relationship.  You’re doing the right thing by researching, but it’s definitely easy to drive yourself crazy when reading articles about codependency.  The road to recovery is hard and lasts your entire lifetime.  It requires a lot of little steps and readjustments in order to realize that you don’t need to find happiness in another person (or in a relationship), but rather from within.  Let me know if you need a friend to talk to, I’m newly out of a 5-year relationship where I lost a lot of myself while trying to be what I thought was the perfect significant other.  Good luck and I’m here if you ever need to talk."

You may consider joining an Al-Anon group to work through some of the grief, which does come in the form of frustration.  I wish you a very successful healing process for the years to come."

My gut tells me you might be okay, leaning a bit towards the tight side in terms of spots filling up, but maybe someone has more experience during this time of year and that time of day.

Needafriend,fcfg2jm,t3_eh3n2b,1577629633.0,"Hey, I’m also open for a new friend and please feel free to DM me.  I’ve been combing through some life changes lately and have been learning a lot about myself in the process.  I was pretty extroverted most of my life but have recently felt a real shift into someone that is a bit more shy.  I’m also the friend that lifts others up but is admittedly bad at taking care of herself.  So feel free to contact me if you’re looking to get to know new people."
Codependency,fc1tpww,t3_efp3gk,1577329419.0,"Yeah, I agree with everything else that was already offered and honestly I’m in a similar scenario (and as a fellow codependent I always find solace in knowing that someone is also in my boat, sometimes).  I find that taking up new interests is really the best option.  I’m a stage in my life where I’m considering grad school, getting a new apartment by myself for the first time as an adult, adjusting to a new role at my job, feeling friendships change as my friends start to settle down, etc.  I also find that traveling more (even if it’s cheap, local travel) or picking up a new hobby you didn’t think you’d like (I kind of like bowling now even tho I’m awful at it).  And as weird and AS DIFFICULT as this next one might sound, putting my phone in a semi or completely inaccessible spot for periods at a time so that I try and disconnect is an important one for me.  And all that time I would normally spend checking my phone?  I’ve been making my way through a book on psychology.  It’s all about perspective and we MUST give people time to warm up to our big ole hearts.  Not everyone is as open as we are (which I’m sure you know is a blessing and a curse!).  People pulling away after initially being quite open is normal for folks that are mildly (or severely) cautious and may have several reasons for being that way that probably don’t have anything to do with what we do (or don’t do).  Just remember to take it easy, give space when you feel like its becoming too much, be compassionate with yourself, know that these things take time.  All things that are worth it take a lot of time, including relationships with others and our own healing process in general.  Best of luck and I’m always available for a direct message if you need a friend."

Codependency,fauqot8,t3_eahi3s,1576351406.0,"As someone who finally came to the realization at 29 that she'd been living a pretty clearcut example of codependency, I can definitely relate to this.  All of this!  I also lead a pretty normal social life, but I do also experience loneliness quite a bit.  I spent a lot of my childhood having to 'grow up at a young age', which definitely has its benefits and some pretty hefty emotional costs, too.  I am familiar with the caliber of loneliness, (definitely more now that I am in this healing process than ever before).  I've often joked to myself that this is probably the reason that many people suppress their feelings and go most (if not their whole life) without dealing with childhood trauma or whatever may have paved the way for an adulthood of codependent tendencies.  If you ever need anyone to chat with about this (or anything else!), feel free to DM me."

I did read somewhere that folks have been raving about how avocados are the new wonder food so I might tap into that idea this week and see if it helps.

However, I’m not on any medication right now and I am beginning to think that maybe I need to during the days between ovulation and when my period begins.  So if it helps at all, I am right there with you right now feeling like a shit bag.  It’s really awful and just flat out sucks.  We can get through this together? :)"
