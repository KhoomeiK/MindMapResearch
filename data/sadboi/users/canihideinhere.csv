depression,erug3wx,t1_erue4ri,1561277806.0,I’m really really trying to hold onto that thought but it is so hard when she is so oppressive. Thank you tho.
depression,ertlw32,t3_c2fuf3,1561246208.0,"This. Absolutely this. I’ve suffered from depression for 16 years and it’s at its absolute worst now that I live back with my mother. She thinks that a lot of it is laziness. Some of it probably is, but I mostly just don’t want to work on her schedule and don’t want to be anywhere near her. I can’t move out yet and I think I might kill myself before I get out of here."
