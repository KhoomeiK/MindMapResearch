At my worst, I was taking like 1200mg of codeine a day.. Even if I only had cocodamol, this means I was taking 30 x 500mg of paracetamol a day and only ever had a liver failure scare once. And trust me, once is enough 

Liver failure occurs when the organ can't produce enough glutathione to remove the N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (a metabolite of paracetamol) from the liver, causing damage.

You can buy a substance called acestylcystine, or NAC for short which replenishes the glutathione in your liver.

Maybe just ask him if he has anything he fancies when you go shopping?

Me and partner eat mostly different things and at completely different times but when I see that she's put effort into cooking me something I don't protest to anything that's on that plate.

That's just her and I'm not in anyway trying to say you're obliged to this but maybe just pick a few things out for him and tell him that he can cook them when he wants them but if he's still expecting meals from you then he can eat what you cook.

I mean, if you really want to, have alternative night, one night you choose and next night he does? Just make sure you make yours healthier."
