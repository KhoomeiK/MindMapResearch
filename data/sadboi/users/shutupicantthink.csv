mentalhealth,f2vpqcu,t1_f2no7g2,1570455829.0,"Hey. Don't know if you're still on here but I just read something that pertains to your post. The article stated that these are called ""intrusive thoughts"" and that "" having the thought does NOT mean having the desire or intent"". Also said that ""excessive intrusive thoughts may be a sign of OCD, so if it's interfering with your daily functioning or causing you distress, see a professional"".
Hope this helps."
mentalhealth,f2nwb0y,t3_ddv0xs,1570320408.0," You're definitely under alot of strain right now. You've got alot going on! Do you see a doctor or a therapist? Taking some medication to help you feel calm could be really helpful. Or if you're interested in yoga or meditation? Sounds like you need to reach out and get a little help where you are. You're going thru a rough patch right now, but I  think you'll be ok if you talk to someone. 
Anyway,  you're not a bad person. You're just a struggling human who was dumped here along with the rest of us to try and figure life out. And as my therapist reminds me- none of us came with an owner's manual! üòÇ 
Take good care of yourself  and good luck."
mentalhealth,f2nrdsn,t1_f2naw7p,1570318970.0,"Stay here and help people! There's alot of people on here that just want to know that someone is listening. 
Also, there is a caregiver's organization in my community that accepts volunteers for things as simple as visiting or even just calling a shut-in once a week. If there's nothing like that in your area- maybe go to the nearest retirement community or hospital?
I live in a retirement area so there really are alot of lonely older people around me. I volunteer walk an older man's dog occasionally too. 
Good luck to you."

If it was a guy you would have seen it coming. It's not your fault she cheated-Bitch pulled the wool over your eyes! That doesn't make you stupid, it just makes her a royal bitch.

I think it's pretty normal for us humans to let our environment rule our emotions. It's hard not to! I guess you have to learn to separate yourself from what's going on around you and practice self care. Put yourself first. Always. It doesn't make you selfish- it makes you healthy!

But I'm still here and you need to know that it does get better. Keep going to therapy, because every time you do , it strengthens and hones those self-management skills. And you'll need those skills for the rest of your life probably. The fact that you're reaching out here is a good sign. Keep seeking help. I hope all of these comments have at least slowed your spiral... And at best, lifted you up a little."

But I went on meds 20 years ago, went to lots of therapy- I still go occasionally-and try to take good care of myself. It sneaks up on me sometimes and I still listen to those voices in my head that tell me I'm a worthless piece of shit. But by now I have lots of practice telling them to shut up and I don't usually spiral down too low. 
Am I  cured? No, but I'm in remission! And I'm a survivor!   That's like the Blue Ribbon, Grand Prize of life."

Now I'm not saying create a whole new identity and lie your ass off- no. Just put up a barrier- a persona that says "" I'm strong and confident and give zero f*cks about your opinion"". When they like or love that side of you, then they'll like/love your vulnerable side too.
And finally- people are going to hurt you. No matter what you do. It's all part of being human and you can't escape it. But YOU get to decide how much damage it does to you. The damage gets less and less as you get older. I'm 63 and suffered from depression and anxiety and abysmal self esteem my whole life and I can honestly say that on most days I feel bulletproof.

I used to feel this way all the time. I had to hold on to  furniture and walls to walk through my house. I passed out several times. My Dr. and I  finally found a medication that addressed both my depression and anxiety. That was 20 years ago and as I recall, all of those symptoms went away within a couple of months and never came back. I've only fainted once in the last 20 years and that was after surgery so it had nothing to do with my mental health. Hope this helps- good luck to you!"

Please stay hyper-aware of your suicidal thoughts when drinking. That's the only time I  ever tried to kill myself. Twice when I was super drunk.

Wearing a mask and not finding joy in anything. That's exactly how I describe my depression to my therapist. I think one of the most affirming, validating thing my therapist ever said to me was ""well, no wonder you feel/act/think this way"" when I  told her my story. She made me feel like a super hero- like no one could have survived that sh*t but me ! :D  I really hope you find some hope and eventually some joy in your life! Man, you really got to me."
mentalhealth,f2iby5a,t3_ddi5h0,1570255064.0,"Holy shit. You had it rough with your dad. What an asshole. Sorry about my language. If you really think about it, you never LEARNED how to make friends. You never got the chance because of him. Wow. What a jerk!  I had a real asshole father too and the only thing that helped me was therapy. I was essentially ""emotionally retarded"" because I learned at about age 4 that if you showed ANY  emotion in front of my father it was a sign of weakness and he was merciless. And I'm a girl so I've been especially f*cked up a good part of my life. Therapy helped me. Alot. And I know about loneliness too. Because when you never learned how to connect with people, you're going to be lonely. I'm getting better about being honest about my feelings with everyone. I actually called a friend last month and admitted that I was so lonely and she had lunch with me. But then I've  texted another really good friend ( I thought) at least 8 times and she always says we should get together, but we never do. And that kind of crushes me, because I once told her she was my best friend. I did have a real true best friend when I was younger but she died young from cancer and i miss her so much. I guess I know now that I'll never find that again. Is there ANYONE- anyone at all that you think you can be honest with about your loneliness? Do you think you could be brave and admit that you're lonely to someone and ask them to spend time with you? Believe me, there are so many lonely people on this planet right now. My God, if anyone were to call me up and say they were lonely and needed me, I think I would be one of the happiest people on this planet! Does it help that we're all scared humans that need human connection? We are. I'm 40 years down the road from you and I know this is true. Reach out to people! Some will make an effort back, some won't.  So you gotta be brave. Also, give a therapist a try. I think you would benefit because our parents can mess us up pretty bad!"
mentalhealth,f2i6rse,t3_ddhlex,1570252993.0,"Sounds like you suffer from depression. I suffer from it and I feel this way all the time. Like I'm not worth it, my life and problems are so stupid NO ONE wants to hear about it.  It's not true, I know but sometimes it's so hard to see any good in anything. This feeling eventually lifts for me. I go to a therapist when it gets really bad because she's about the only one that can convince me that I'm worthwhile and I matter and helps the feeling to go away a little faster.

Why would they want you to come to work if you are sick? You will make everyone else sick !! A good boss/manager knows this and should insist you stay away. 
Bottom line: get to a doctor, you need to break this cycle of constant illness and get well. As your health improves, your stress and anxiety should diminish. Poor thing! Get well soon!"

Sounds like you have zero connection to your current one. And believe me, a connection is crucial! I'm 63 and been blessed to find 2 therapists in my lifetime that I really connected with. I can't imagine where I'd be today if I hadn't found them. But I had to wade thru a swamp of mediocre ones to find them!  Keep searching for yours. Stay on the meds.
