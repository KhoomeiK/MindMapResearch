The crystal stars weren‚Äôt just used by the Shadow Queen but one was harnessed for evil purposes by Grubba, the other became a gem in the hoard of a pirate king. Another was used to transform villagers into pigs. The stars being neutral and acting towards their master was a great theme I thought and more interesting than Mario rescuing (the already benevolent) Star Spirits"

If anything, the peaceful Goombas are at this point more worried about the Koopas considering how often they invade the Kingdom and hence give many innocent Goombas a bad name.

To have this beautiful sequence in the middle as a little respite in between adventures was so nice. Super Mario Odyssey is one of my all time favorites and that‚Äôs saying something considering how many damn near perfect other games are in the series.
