Here are some helpful tools! 
-deep breathing during a very heated moment (you can Google that, it's simple) 
-excersize 

Long term practices
-meditation

Mindsets
-respond, don't react. This means to walk away from a situation until you are as calm as you can get. We all react with anger, sadness, etc., But take time to calm down, think, then respond. It will yield better results and avoid wrecklessness a little! 

P.s. be patient with yourself in handling and managing anger! It takes practice :)"

psychologystudents,f617x7z,t3_dq7zap,1572635131.0,"Hello! I am a senior psychology major who has been working through depression (pretty much gone now!). I went into psychology for PRECISELY this reason you are: to understand myself, be happy for myself, and take my knowledge to help others! I was depressed when I started my major. I will tell you at times it felt awful when I put pressure on myself to be happy because I thought.. if I am not happy, how can I help others??? How am I a good example?? Here's the thing:  People like therapists who have experienced mental health issues. We want someone who has been through it and is a shining example of how to get through it.  For me it's been a journey to be this example.  I almost gave up several times, on myself and this major. Progress can be slow moving but you also don't have to give yourself a timeline of when you need to be better.  But it has been SO worth it for me ultimately. If you feel a calling to do this path, do it. It may be a struggle but long term its always best to follow your passions. If you can do ok enough in school while struggling with mental health, fuckin do it! Follow your passions. Keep your business credits and take it as a minor if you want too! This is my experience at least, hope that gives insight:) 

Edit: Keep searching for what works, whether it's a better therapist, different medications, etc. I have found nuggets of information in my classes that lead me to my solutions. What got me out what a good therapist, psychedelic mushrooms, and spirituality which I learned about in Drugs and Behavior. (Not for everyone) So if you go into psychology you are much more likely to find what works for you and know what to avoid. Be patient with yourself if you do take this path:)"
