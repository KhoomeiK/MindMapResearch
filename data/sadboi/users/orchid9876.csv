It’s unfortunate, I suppose, but most people tend to mate with another person on their relative level of attractiveness. It’s just the way it is. Of course there are exceptions, and maybe that’s what they are trying to achieve, to be the exeption. 

When I was single- I personally would date a guy who was lower on the attraction level but had all of those qualities but I will say something.
