BPD,fql7s1e,t3_gj1nob,1589449259.0,"Idk if anyone can relate but I've done it multiple times but it's only during dissociative episodes and I age regress - I speak as though I'm a child in distress and I chant ""I want to go home, please bring me home"" and it honestly is just the worst thing to experience, I only remember it because my family would tell me it was what I was repeating over and over. It probably really relates to our 'homes' having been the base of our trauma/pain."
BPD,fpxfn4p,t3_gg0gcr,1588981778.0,"Why do I do this too?? Ahahhaha. I had an occasion in school where I was doing school work with a friend at her house, and I'd heard that people in our class had been talking shit about me. Coincidentally she had a tab open on her laptop of a group chat and I snooped. She was at the bathroom and I was going through the chats and looking at what they said about me. I knew I shouldn't have but I did. 

So what I found was a loooot of shitty things that those assholes said about me including them poking fun at my suffering (I was struggling really bad). Oh I was triggered but when she came back I had to act normal ahahahaha. So I totally relate to what you said about finding things relative to the situation.

I hate that I do it but I can't help it because I KNOW there's things that I need to see. I hate my lack of respect for other's privacy and I really need to work on it."
BPDmemes,fptfozx,t1_fpqsjho,1588890404.0,Lmao how about when you leave multiple calls on Messenger and see them ONLINE and you know they're ignoring and rejecting every call. Then you spam and you know they read everything because the messages got through!!!
BPDmemes,fptfirr,t3_geufo9,1588890314.0,"Oh what a timely comment! I met someone online, we exchanged facebook, snapchat and our numbers and in literally 2 days i got blocked. So this was all I kept searching...

Best part is finding out they made that effort to block you on EVERYTHING. So I went ballistic and called them about 20 times till they finally blocked my number and when I tried calling the calls wouldn't go through. Best experience ha ha this is why I don't talk to anyone."
BPD,flz96ou,t1_flz8l4b,1585618313.0,"Omg haha thank you for replying to my sad vent. It truly sucks not being able to have appointments in person. I'm sorry that it's such a shitty time but I'm glad your therapist is still keeping in contact.

I don't know what to do. It's just really pathetic that I expressed my thoughts hahha it was just getting too much. I just keep responding to my FP really passive aggressively when it isnt his fault he HAS to be apart. And it just feels like a truckload of abandonment when he isn't actually abandoning me. It's just the loneliness and pain causing me to believe he's enjoying the distance right?"
BorderlinePDisorder,flz6oe0,t3_fs1xpj,1585616706.0,If I may ask what are these triggers like for you? And are they from the BPD or depression?
