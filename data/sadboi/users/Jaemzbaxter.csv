books,fo5amzc,t3_g5qir9,1587521169.0,"I’m at the end of the Prydain series by Lloyd Alexander and it DOES contain a farm boy but it has zero of anything else you hate. MC takes forever to mature- isn’t good at much by first books’ end, all supporting characters are unique and some even die, rich people are still cool. Also- Sabriel by Garth Nix is very good. MC is down to earth and doesn’t become a huge hero overnight. All books by Robin McKinley are lovely- the MC’s do learn “quickly” but she does explain that time passes, so it’s realistic. The Blue Sword and the Hero and the Crown are wonderful. Just a couple suggestions! I get frustrated with all of that too so if you have any favorites that don’t have those issues please let us know! With this quarantine, I’m almost through my library for the second time. :/"

BipolarReddit,fmdad04,t3_fugsxp,1585962966.0,"I wonder that too, a LOT. Is my [29F] bitchiness because I’m a spoiled brat or because I can’t handle my environment/situation? Am I just a bad person (and here, I am very much condensing all of my awfulness into one big lump) or is it because of the physical and mental strain I deal with every day? How do I know which ones are my fault and which ones flow out of me without my consent? 

I have *chosen* to believe that when I look with hindsight at my recent past episodes of being a turd that when I am lashing out because I’m scared or insecure or in pain (mental, emotional, physical) that those are the moments I can’t help. That’s me being human and/or bipolar. Still my fault, still worthy of apologizing for. But when I am being mean to hurt, and when I’m having a tantrum because I’m not getting my way, then I know that it is absolutely on me. Sometimes my reasons for being mean are mixed and that’s hard to work through. Anyways, I hope it helps you. It’s obviously not an elaborate, worked-through theory or anything but a quick thought. Hindsight, and working through each situation- digging into why I did what I did, my motivation and past experiences, how I was feeling that day or what externally was going on at the same time, those things help me. And then the next time I’m in a situation where I can choose to be one thing or the other...it gets a fraction of a hair easier to make good choices. 

And as a last note- I kind of went off on my own thing your post reminded me of. I’m not implying you are me or bitchy or mean!! Xxoo"

No matter how many times you feel like you’ve overcome it, there’s always the same stupid hurdles that you battled last time. But I’ve found that trying (not always succeeding) to not compare myself to others help me feel the victories a little better. Like, ok, I don’t have my shit together compared to the world’s standards, but I didn’t go into debt last time I was manic and I didn’t lose my shit on my husband just because he was breathing wrong after I had a bad day. Two victories. And those victories are an encouragement to be strong the next time I deal with those problems. Yeah- I’m gonna keep failing a lot but maybe not as often. 


And as a side note- you said you let your illness infect you...uh, no you don’t. People with heart problems don’t “let” themselves have palpitations and people with asthma don’t “let” themselves have breathing problems. It’s an illness that acts on you."

That being said, I was told that seroquel (and I would be curious if this is true for many other mind-meds) can permanently alter your brain’s chemical makeup.

BipolarReddit,f0xs7ep,t3_d6x3lb,1569044297.0,Just checking in to say an emphatic yes. The crazy “I’m crying over a picture of a dead animal” to “sorry your grandma died- guess you shoulda thought of that before it finally happened” is awful and I hate both sides.
SkincareAddiction,f0xoz98,t3_d74f5u,1569040313.0,"It depends on what you’re putting on. I dry my face after washing it and apply my first layer immediately (water based product), then continue to apply new layers once the last one is fully dry. But when I apply retin-a, I wait a good long while before applying it because any moisturize will cause irritation. Then I wait a good long while to apply anything after that. You really just need to see what products might interfere with another, or if any work better with your pH balance."

Makeup,ezpnbbu,t1_ezpfj24,1568044090.0,"I do shave, but not consistently because it breaks me out. And I will look into shape tape, except how is it different from the hydrating shape tape? Is the formula really different?"
Makeup,ezlybao,t1_ezlmlql,1567983445.0,Thanks! I think I’m gonna ditch it :)

bipolar,evyo7zf,t3_clwtht,1564937304.0,"Seroquel rx was a life saver for me. You and I are about same age/weight and I was on 300 mg for almost a year. It does get you some fantastic sleep, and you will be groggy for a bit longer than normal in the morning, but just know that anything you introduce to your body is gonna take time to adjust. I felt amazingly ‘normal’ on seroquel, led a great stable life on it. The reason I went off of it is because I literally could not sleep less than 10 hours on it and it left me with no time after work to see my husband (I was working 12hr shifts). But seroquel is a wonder drug and the best I’ve been on (my insurance made me try out 14 other drugs before seroquel). You could gain weight, and my advice is that if you notice a gain of ten pounds, look into a drug alternative. Don’t wait till you’ve gained excessive weight! 
You don’t turn into a zombie or lose your creativity- that tends to be what antidepressants do. Drugs for bipolar are mood stabilizers, and they are way different. You’ll be just fine, because you are careful and caring."
