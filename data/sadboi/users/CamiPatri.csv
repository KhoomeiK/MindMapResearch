polyamory,foqo0ig,t1_foqkr0j,1587997611.0,"Jesus Christ. First of all, who the fuck does that? Everyone woman I’ve ever had sex with I always ask if something is okay. “Stealthing” is just frat boy rape culture behavior that is totally unacceptable but douchey guys think it’s okay because they heard it from other douches. I’m sorry that you’re experiencing some paranoia there I would be too because it’s creepy af. Getting cheated on or being involved in someone’s cheating is really creepy and it’s sucks know you’ve been manipulated. I’m glad you have the beard friend. He seems like a good guy. I can’t grow a beard but I am athletic and muscular hahah"
polyamory,foqnhh1,t1_foqm55b,1587997317.0,I’m not sure if it’s actual hypocrisy. It’s more like him trying to shift the blame onto you and shame you for your ethical choices that are unpopular while he indulges in his unethical choices which are poplar (sadly)
polyamory,foqm08y,t1_foqi31x,1587996466.0,Wtf!? See this is why I don’t lie. Like even if I have something fucked up to say I just say it anyway because the truth always...ALWAYS comes out
polyamory,foqi5f8,t1_foq7orx,1587994107.0,"Wow, I feel so bad for that guy. That’s so fucking shitty. Just be open. It’s hard but not as hard as being a cheater wtf I can’t stand cheating. And it’s almost always done poorly. Like they’re trying to get caught"
polyamory,foq7n9t,t1_foq5fwt,1587985871.0,Thank you for that <3 I love the solidarity here
polyamory,foq3ux4,t1_foq3kxz,1587982029.0,And the thing is. If that happened to me in this situation I would’ve just said “yeah I already know that” lol like I wouldn’t have recognized the problem
polyamory,foq3s8j,t1_foq3kxz,1587981951.0,That is actually horrifying. I’m so sorry for her :(
polyamory,foq3r57,t1_foq339u,1587981920.0,You’re right. I didn’t realize at first but now I know. It has also happened to me with monogamy so here we are. People think they can pull one over on me because I have autism but that doesn’t make me an idiot
polyamory,foq1ey5,t1_foq1cok,1587979466.0,That’s true but it also made me want to leave polyamory all together. That didn’t last long though

polyamory,fopicyc,t1_fophgd1,1587962268.0,Thank you and sorry to you as well. I just gotta remember that shitty people are shitty
polyamory,fopgy4i,t1_fopggz6,1587961216.0,I see. I feel like it’s a total disservice to the poly world to do this. I still have no idea who he thought I was or what he thought our relationship was. It honestly creeps me out
polyamory,fopg6yq,t1_fopg3p1,1587960658.0,I’m sorry you went through that. I also feel like an asshole because I didn’t realize that he didn’t know...but something told me that he was very uncomfortable and should’ve listened to that feeling
