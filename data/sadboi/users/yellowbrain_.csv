As far as I know, they completely changed Hannah's suicide scene so it would be more shocking, and although they removed (did they?) that part after all the controversy it caused, I think they should have been more careful in the first place. Suicide is a sensitive topic and not everyone can write about it. We need to stop romanticising suicide and mental health issues and TV-series shouldn't portray them as something glamorous. They are not, and these scenes don't help, they can be triggering."

I hope you have a great year and a great life."
