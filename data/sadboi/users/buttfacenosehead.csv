Other times you are so exhausted when you  finish you could sleep in the crew room with the giant dueling televisions on either side of the room.

I maintain a low-profile & stay the hell out of the way.  I always leave the bathroom nicer than i found it - so i don't burn the crew in the event of a pop-up inspection. When I'm in the chow line I make an announcement that anybody who needs to get on station can go in front of me, etc. 

Ultimately we'll get off that boat & our corporate cards will have rooms waiting for us in a nice hotel. We'll be the only ones in our bathrooms taking  long hot showers before going out for a great meal on that same card. So the least we can do is keep our heads low & remember that ship is their home & they're making quite a sacrifice.
