It's definitely a reason, but in my case, I was clinically insane when I was roped into Mary Kay. I'm severely bipolar, but despite numerous red flags throughout my life (and other less intense episodes, including psychosis), I had not yet been diagnosed. So in 2016 I had my most severe manic episode that turned into (you guessed it) severe psychosis. I had a teaching career which I had to leave suddenly due to my mental state. At some point after this, I ended up in Mary Kay. I don't even remember how or why. I was hospitalized four times. After I was hospitalized the first time, my director and all of my ""friends"" became uncomfortable around me because I was ""crazy"" (well, yes, but you know what they were thinking). My director said it was shameful and I better not tell anyone that I've spent time in a psychiatric hospital. She also said some crap about praying to Jesus in lieu of taking my medication, but that's a story for another time. Once I started to come out of the psychosis the first time, I realized what had happened and just stopped talking to everyone (I knew they weren't REALLY my friends) and quit. I was really ashamed of myself. Prior to this episode, I had always been against MLMs. After my episode, I went right back to being against them. I did many other stupid and even downright destructive things while psychotic, but joining MK is still quite embarrassing.

I know what you're talking about though, and I've of course experienced that. But it's just not worth it, to me. The thing is, we ARE the things we love about ourselves when we're manic. We ARE creative and intelligent (in so many different ways-- not everyone paints masterpieces, for instance), at the core. The only thing that changes is the output, really. Instead of ideas hitting you like a tidal wave of cement, they come at a more normal pace. It's a hard transition for us. But we're not amazing JUST because we have bipolar disorder. Yes, many of the world's most intelligent and creative people were/are bipolar. BUT, also, many of the world's most intelligent and creative people were/are not bipolar. That's how I look at it.

If he works in a bar that he believes to be haunted and has had paranormal experiences before, I can see him nopeing out of there. I would! Some people might get used to it, but I'm fairly confident I would just always be scared."

It's hard to accept that the illness is just something shitty that happened to you, and now you need to fight to get better and learn to live with it. Before I had to withdraw from grad school, I was working on my thesis and it had something to do with this. It was on American adaptations of French fables and fairy tales and how child-rearing shapes children's perception of failure. (Unfortunately, I wrote most of it while manic and you can totally tell and now I have to start over 😭). That's still too broad but I was working towards a thesis. But what I learned is that American children are inadvertently taught that failure is their fault. A good example is The Little Engine That Could. There is no realistic way that that gd engine could carry the toys over the mountain-- but he believed he could! I read through so much research on this and it was really eye-opening. I'm not assuming you or anyone else on this thread is American, but in the U.S. we have a very pioneer-esque attitude and constantly drill in kids' heard that anything is possible IF they want it badly enough. I'm all for having a positive attitude and working your ass off, but the truth is... Shit happens. You can want something with every fiber of your being and work your butt off and do everything right, and still fail. My professor is French and she was incredibly understanding because she knows that shit happens (I also think she's bipolar). It's not necessarily a reflection on you.

To quote Jean-Luc Picard: ""It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness.""

I think that's always important to remember. We have this shitty disease and it sucks and it affects our lives and the lives of our loved ones in huge ways. It's a constant, exhausting battle. From experience, stuff does start to get better and that's a sigh of relief-- but it's still a constant battle, and it's still shitty. We didn't do something wrong, we were born with it (afaik). What IS important is what we do about it, so as far as I'm concerned, if you get up every day with the attitude of ""I'm going to have a day and do the best I can"", that's enough. Maybe that's eating a handful of M&Ms and laying in bed. That's fine. Taking your meds, listening to your doctor, going to therapy, overall just trying to get better to the best of YOUR ability on that given day-- that's amazing and you're badass. Look at all the people around you who have never had to  struggle and fight like you do? You're strong!

That's how I try to look at it. :) We're badass mfs."

AskReddit,f3yaiyv,t3_dim1gy,1571251072.0,"Not the most interesting story, but I speak French. So a long time ago, maybe in 2009, I was working at the campus bookstore during ""fall rush"". Anyway, this dude is next in my line and he speaks French to me. He just said something like, ""hello, how are you?"". His pronunciation wasn't great, but I was exhausted after ringing up angry customers for hours on end even though I didn't create the textbook prices and couldn't do a damn thing about them, and just went into autopilot. I continued the transaction in French. He had no idea wtf I was saying. So he says, ""Oh. I don't actually speak French. I was trying to prank you. Guess it blew up in my face.""

Again, not the best story, but it's kind of funny."
