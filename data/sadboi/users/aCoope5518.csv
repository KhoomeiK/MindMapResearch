Seattle,f1oipzt,t1_f1ohwb9,1569647147.0,"I see what you are saying. I understand that it is a red flag to employers to have not held down a job for more than 8 months. Much of it was due to mental illness. Which isn‚Äôt always seen in an understanding light. I still think it is possible for me to change that. I don‚Äôt think anyone has to live based on what they have done in their past. But I can understand with a history how difficult it may be. My partner is very financially stable and has always held down a steady job, which is helpful in thinking for the future. Thankyou again for your insight. I‚Äôm glad you were able to adjust and feel comfortable in the city. I hope it has been a positive adjustment for you."
Seattle,f1ohu2f,t1_f1ohnfg,1569646148.0,"I‚Äôve found a few outside of the city. To be honest, I wouldn‚Äôt mind living on the outskirts, as long as the city was near by and close enough to visit often. The apartments I looked at were decent, affordable for the jobs my partner and I both qualify for, and actually in good condition. I looked on Facebook, but do you have any other suggestions on where I could look?"

I‚Äôve just always wanted to move away, which is why I‚Äôm asking before I make any crazy decisions. I am asking what it is like because I don‚Äôt know :) Thankyou for your insights."
