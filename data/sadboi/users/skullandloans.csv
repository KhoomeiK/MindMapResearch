Encourage them to spend time applying for all the **scholarships** they qualify for at their school. Encourage them to **live at home**. *Encourage them to consider carefully the career they want to pursue and whether it will offer a good return on the financial investment.* Ideally they wont have to borrow more than what they qualify for in federal loans each year ($5500 freshman, $6500 sophomore, $7500 junior, $7500 senior), but it depends on the cost of the school.

**My situation**: I lived at home and worked ~30 hours a week. I attended the county community college for the first 2 years (I was fortunate that it was one of the top rated in the country) and paid cash for tuition/books. It came out to less than $1000 per semester as a full-time student. I took some years off to work and build my savings account and consider what I wanted in a career, and eventually decided to finish my bachelor's degree. At this time I was considered an independent student. A family member generously offered to let me stay with them while attending the school nearby. I went to the state university, which averaged about $5000 per semester for my remaining 2 years. I spent *a lot* of time applying for scholarships at my school, and I was extremely fortunate that merit-based scholarships covered the majority of my tuition. As for the remaining tuition and living expenses (transportation/utilities/food/textbook rentals, etc), I paid from my savings. I finished undergrad debt free. Please know that this is not typical, it was the result of both undeniable privileges (quality local CC, option to live at home or with family, scholarships) and hard work (working during CC, building up a savings, scholarships).

StudentLoans,fqpbqeb,t1_fqp4y09,1589541869.0,"Payments are required to be applied in this order: fees (like late fees, if there are any on your account), interest, principal. As long as you have paid off all the accrued interest, the rest of your payment will go to the principal balance. Since monthly payments on (a standard repayment plan) cover the interest that has accrued that month, paying any extra hits the principal. You never pay ""future interest"" on student loans, and *you cannot skip paying the interest that has already accrued*. If you're taking out an unsubsidized loan, there is no way to avoid paying interest. The goal is simply to minimize the amount of interest you pay, which comes down to 1) borrowing as little as you can, and 2) paying it off as quickly as you can. 

The 6% federal loans may be slightly higher in interest than equivalent private loans, but not by much, and it is cheap insurance to have all the protections that federal loans have. Private loans offer very little flexibility when it comes to payments, if you fall on hard times and can't afford them."

Fill out the FAFSA every year. Federal loans are always better than private loans because they offer income-based repayment options, forgiveness options, and deferments if you cant afford your payments. **With very high loan balances like yours, these protections will be invaluable. Do not borrow private loans.**

Loans accrue simple interest daily. To calculate the annual interest, multiply the balance by the interest rate. Example: $10,000 loan at 5% = 10,000 x 0.05 = $500. On this loan, you will pay $500 in interest every year until the loan is paid off. 

Your loans will start to accrue interest as soon as you borrow them, even while you're in school, so you'll graduate with a lot more than $400,000 in debt. You can play around with some online student debt calculators. For example, this one (https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/college-planning/loan-calculator.aspx) estimates that with that balance, repaying over 10 years, your monthly minimum payment will be about $4250 and you will pay $109,000 in interest on top of your $400,000 principal.

The total amount of money you pay for student loans depends on 3 factors: the original balance, the interest rate, and time. Decreasing any of these 3 factors decreases the total cost.

The total cost of the loan is the original $10,000, plus $500 every year until it is paid back. 

The overall cost of a loan is a function of the original balance, the interest rate, and *time.* Making larger monthly payments will eliminate the loan sooner, and be cheaper in the long run. Making smaller monthly payments will make the loan take longer to pay off, and be more expensive in the long run.

Usually student loans are placed on a standard repayment plan, typically 10 years. The monthly payment is calculated based on the balance and the interest rate, and guarantees that the loan will be paid off after 120 payments. 

Sometimes people can't afford their monthly payment and need to pay less at a time. Federal loans have an income-based option, which can lower the monthly payment. The amount due each month is calculated instead based on how much you earn, not based on the balance of the loan.

[Using your example, about $200 in interest will accrue in 2 years. When that interest capitalizes, your new loan balance will be $2200, and youll now pay 5% interest on $2200, which is now $110 per year, or $9.16 per month.] You're charged ""interest on interest."" 

Interest will continue to accrue on the loan every month, from disbursement and through school and repayment, until it is paid off. Since interest accumulates daily, the ""total to pay"" depends on how soon you pay the loan off. Sooner payoff = less interest to pay.

>But if I pay $8.33 a month while I am in school then the total to repay will be $2000 plus interest as I repay it? 

Yes. You could pay $8.33 a month while in school, or save up and pay off all the accrued interest during the grace period (the six months following graduation). As long as you pay the interest in full before it capitalizes upon repayment, whether as a monthly installment or as one lump sum, it will not capitalize."
StudentLoans,fpvwps1,t3_gfv88d,1588953197.0,"You can calculate your annual interest by multiplying your principal balance by your interest rate. Then divide by 12 to calculate the approximate monthly interest. 

Example: $2000 loan, 5% interest rate

(2000 * 0.05) = $100 per year, or (100/12) = approximately $8.33 per month.

This calculation of accruing interest will remain the same after graduation. Accrued interest will capitalize upon entering repayment, which typically happens 6 months after you leave school. As long as you pay it off before entering repayment, it will not capitalize. You can pay it now, monthly, or you can pay it within the first 6 months after graduation, and the effect will be the same."

No. Federal loans also offer income-based repayment plans, forbearance, and forgiveness options.

Consider the federal student loan accommodations for the current COVID crisis, for example.
