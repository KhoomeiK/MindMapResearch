stepparents,fqqsr4r,t3_gk51gn,1589571289.0,"I met with my partner's ex when I started getting involved with the kids. My partner had told me she started sleeping with some guy at work and left with the 2 kids and he never knew why. She was very vindictive during the separation so I figured there was more to the story. Maybe he cheated first, was abusive, was neglectful, SOMETHING... So I asked her directly, ""Is there something wrong, something I should look out for?""
She said ""Nope, nothing really wrong with him. I just wanted to go out to bars and have fun and he would rather stay home with the kids. I just wanted to go out.""
I still don't understand why she's so awful if she's got nothing to be vengeful over...
Sometimes the story is right in between each of their version of events, sometimes your partner is full of it, sometimes the ex is full of it... Worth asking but take the response with a grain of salt if it opposes what your partner says."

I'm arguing that in our household, the children would never be kept from communicating with the other parent. I'm annoyed that this woman has violated an agreement she signed simply using the excuse that she's the mother so what she says goes. I'm upset that she's getting away with denying my partner the rights he has to his children because the courts aren't currently hearing non-emergency cases.

I tried for several years when I was married (thankfully it didn't take) and my current partner and I haven't used protection in about 2 years. I had come to resent my body for being a barren wasteland over the years.

When I mentioned to my mom that I was late for my period but I assumed it was just stress, we both joked about how I should take a test. A few days later, I waited until my partner left (because I was embarrassed to be testing 6 months after my gynecologist told me I'd need medical intervention to get pregnant) and was absolutely stunned when it was positive. After years of infertility I'm still finding it unbelievable that I'm a bit less than half way to having a baby.

Congratulations on your big news!!!"

EatingDisorders,fhoqc4z,t3_f48c4l,1581769584.0,"Never been through it and I'm not a doctor but from the best of my understanding (which is admittedly limited) the IV refeed may be beneficial in preventing problems when reintroducing food. By malnourishing your body when not eating, you change the way your body handles food and nutrients. By starting with IV nutrients, then adding food back slowly, you slowly reintroduce your metabolism to processing food/nutrients. 
I am not positive but I think it can be life threatening to reintroduce food without IV refeeding. Nobody at the hospital will think less of you because you're seeking help in a safe, medically controlled environment."

Maybe it also has something to do with timing. I used to hate waking up in the morning so there would be times I'd skip showers to sleep more. For me, I had to bathe at night, knowing I might oversleep and not have time in the morning. 
I'd sit down with him and, without making him feel attacked, explain why personal hygiene is so important, why it bothers you that he isn't talking care of himself, and see if he can give you a solid reason for not bathing (like he likes the grunge look or something.) 
Also, if it turns out he does just like the greasy look, get him hair products that will allow his hair to look gross without smelling gross. Teenagers, especially at that age, are confounding."

The only real recommendation we got from the pediatrician was a website called Dr. Yum but I don't think she recognized how bad their diets were, as most of the foods on the website they would never consider touching. The pediatrician did get through to the 8 year old a little, letting her know how serious it was that she eat more fiber... As far as getting the mother on-board, she doesn't seem to understand nutrition and refuses to go to the pediatrician office, even if the children are ill.
