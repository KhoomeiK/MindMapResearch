BPD,fkgymia,t3_fi06qa,1584180792.0,"I have BPD and ADHD. 

Pros of weed: 
- stops my anxious mind from racing 
- slows time down, allows me to spend more time focusing on a single thing 
- makes me laugh 
- makes me eat 
- helps me sleep 
- no ptsd nightmares 
- helps curb irritability, anger, rage 
- helps with boredom 
- can help with productivity depending on strain, task, intention
- lifts depression temporarily 
- prevents splitting 
- helped me stop drinking 

Cons of weed:
- paranoia heightened 
- lack of productivity 
- lower self esteem, causes depression
- not getting things done causes anxiety 
- intrusive thoughts more frequent and less controllable 
- even less executive functioning 
- irritable when I don‚Äôt have it 
- unable to slow down without it 
- unable to eat without it 
- wake up nauseous 
- wake up groggy, sleep through alarm 
- no nightmares, but lesser quality of sleep 
- hygiene suffers out of laziness 
- diet poor, sugar 
- spending more money on snacks and eating out, getting food delivery 
- binge eating 
- less physical activity 
- social anxiety heightened in groups 
- memory suffers, already bad because ADHD (this makes therapy less effective)
- harder to control impulses 
- don‚Äôt plan very far in advance, very difficult to set and achieve long term goals 
- makes pollen allergy symptoms worse 
- expensive
- began to develop CHS after 2+ years of smoking weed daily 
- negative interaction with Ritalin (physically uncomfortable and the meds lose effectiveness)

Daily use helped me cope with how uncomfortable some of my mental illness symptoms were. After time, it began to exacerbate more symptoms than it helped. Then, it made me sick. I‚Äôm grateful to be learning new and more coping skills instead of relying on weed so heavily. I‚Äôm looking forward to using it for fun about once or twice a month once my allergies fade.

Edit: 
- Strains matter
- pesticides = anxiety 
- heavy indica = in my head = intrusive thoughts, paranoia, anxiety, depression, couched
- heavy sativa = heart racing, worrying, anxiety 

Best thing for me is a 60/40 sativa dominant hybrid with fruity terpenes. I stopped using a bong and only use a bowl now. Less THC is better. Limesicle tests at about 18% and that is comfortable for me."

You will be mood swingy and irritable. The ‚ÄúI need a fucking cigarette‚Äù feeling comes out of nowhere, even several weeks into quitting. I had success in replacing it with food. Be a person that always has snacks on you. But be gentle on yourself, take space, cause you‚Äôll wanna fight people lol. 

You‚Äôll understand what it‚Äôs like for your cravings to play tricks on your brain, and that should make it easier to follow through. With cigs it‚Äôs a lot of ritual. Intentionally replace those rituals with things that use your mouth and hands. 

Don‚Äôt get sucked back in when the seasons change. The seasonal rituals you miss, and forgot about, will haunt you - don‚Äôt be lured!

You might get cold or even flu like symptoms a couple weeks in, depending on how much you smoke. Coughing up phlegm and stuff. Your body is purging, it‚Äôs a good thing. 

Since it takes kind of a while to fully withdraw, it‚Äôs easy to confuse things as not being part of your withdrawal, when actually they totally are. I like the app NOMO for tracking progress/reminding myself of what my body is going through.

BPD,fka9x74,t3_fh6ffy,1583998338.0,"Stop projecting. You are not that person. 

Forgive yourself. You have these coping mechanisms because they served you well at one point in time. You were likely a child and likely had no control at the time, speaking statistically. 

What you CAN control is the management of your symptoms to be best of your ability, and taking accountability for your actions. This looks like making amends, which for me, is an acknowledgement and then behavior follows. Saying sorry and doing nothing to change it for next time isn‚Äôt making amends. 

It‚Äôs hard for us to do this because we were once victims. Accepting that we aren‚Äôt anymore is hard for a lot of reasons. Unlearning learned helplessness is hard, but has been SO worth it for me.

I‚Äôve been on antidepressants for years. They made my mood swings more manageable but I didn‚Äôt feel happy. 

I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed with ADHD until my late 20s. I thought I had anxiety and depression and borderline. Turns out the ADHD was causing anxiety and depression. Got on the right meds, and I can‚Äôt tell you what a difference it makes. My new psychiatrist is going to take me off the antidepressants. She says they have been sending happy chemicals to the completely wrong section of my brain. 

BPD is often comorbid and it really helps to know what else you might have. 

I‚Äôve read (in a lecture meant for psych grad students) that with BPD, you get on meds at first to manage the symptoms. Then with therapy, you learn coping skills and change the way you think. Then you don‚Äôt necessarily need the medication anymore. 

Also, don‚Äôt make your recovery about your favorite person. Make it about you. You‚Äôre not willing to lose the people you love to this Illness, you‚Äôll do everything in your power to learn to be a person who doesn‚Äôt cause harm. That‚Äôs what I tell myself anyway. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Also, DBT didn‚Äôt work for me. I have a tendency to obsess and overthink. Examining my thoughts wasn‚Äôt helping. Now I‚Äôm doing ACT therapy.

I‚Äôm a person who walked the dog every day this week! I can do stuff!‚Äù Then you see yourself differently and continue to act accordingly. I call it proving myself wrong.

Also also, nutrition REALLY matters. If you‚Äôre not getting omega 3s, the brain can‚Äôt absorb its happy chemicals. Vitamin D is huge for mood. Sugar causes depression. Caffeine exacerbates anxiety. Etc."
BPD,fk6u0lj,t3_faszy5,1583916104.0,"This is called splitting. I do it too, to pretty much everyone. Environment, establishments, employer, friends, boyfriend, self. 

I know it‚Äôs happening when I can‚Äôt feel empathy for people I know I care for. If I were to try to make a pros and cons list about my best friend, it would be all bad (when splitting). 

It happens when I feel my vulnerability to them. I don‚Äôt feel vulnerable or recognize it. At first I feel annoyed by the thing, and if I let that go on, I‚Äôll move to downright hating the thing and even being kinda cruel to it. Pushing it away. 

BPD‚Äôs tag line is ‚ÄúI hate you, don‚Äôt leave me‚Äù for a reason. We idealize people, find a flaw, fears of rejection or abandonment or whatever get activated, we sense vulnerability, we immediately & fully retract to protect ourselves from such pain. Whether perceived or real. Hence the BPD paranoia. We can get kinda mean (BPD rage) when in this state. When we snap out of it, we are super sorry. Then we feel vulnerable and afraid all over again but this time we have devalued ourselves and we are desperate for the person not to leave us. 

I‚Äôve lost quite a few people to this. 

I imagine it‚Äôs learned in childhood. My mom was super mentally ill, I never knew what to expect from her. This hyper vigilant practice of protecting myself from any vulnerability kept me safe in that environment. We must unlearn it because it‚Äôs not useful in healthy relationships. 

You posted this, so you knew how you were feeling about your friends wasn‚Äôt quite right. Trust that intuition. It helps me to journal a lot so I can click myself back into reality. I reread things and remember how much I love the people I love. I try to forgive myself for being like this. I burn the steam off. I try not to self isolate, I try to let friends know what‚Äôs going on. And then I see them again when I‚Äôm in the right state of mind.

My sister has an immune deficiency. I‚Äôve been driving myself bonkers trying to keep the world 100% clean because I‚Äôm terrified that she will get sick. 

I can‚Äôt afford to lose money. I don‚Äôt have savings. Just today I was denied for emergency dental surgery as I don‚Äôt have the money. 

What I should have said was, please patronize local businesses, and please follow the CDC guidelines to a T when you do. 

People either aren‚Äôt taking it seriously or don‚Äôt know that they‚Äôre spreading germs. I wish people were better informed. I wish people would take our shared responsibility of public health in this instance seriously, especially when going to a public place. I guess I can‚Äôt blame the populace but rather should blame our governments for disseminating conflicting/unclear information. 

I‚Äôm just scared. I don‚Äôt want to lose my person."
Seattle,fk6mq4k,t1_fk6lwg3,1583907287.0,I feel you. No one should ever feel unsafe. Karen was never unsafe in this situation - she just thought her preferences were of a much higher priority than they are. Smell doesn‚Äôt threaten the safety of others.

Seattle,fk6ksg8,t1_fk6glq9,1583905290.0,"I get that. 

As someone who grew up poor, I didn‚Äôt want to eat too much for fear of my stomach expanding. I wanted to train my body to need as little as possible for survival - and it worked. I never wanted to get something I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have consistently. It was painful to lose."
Seattle,fk4yfg4,t1_fk4ovbx,1583870002.0,"Yeah I totally hear you. I guess I didn‚Äôt explain myself clearly. 

My experience as a barista is that since the offices and schools are closed, we are super busy. I have felt stressed about being responsible for keeping everyone safe. Even the customers who are clearly just ignoring CDC guidelines. Sometimes there‚Äôs just one person on staff and it isn‚Äôt possible to wait on customers while also cleaning door handles every time they‚Äôre used. It would be more manageable if everyone wasn‚Äôt flocking to these public spaces, creating the crowds they‚Äôre trying to avoid by closing their offices. 

Sorry for being alarmist. Someone close to me has an immune deficiency disorder and I just want to keep them safe."

This is verbal, emotional and physical abuse. The person shows no remorse. These are giant red flags which indicate that will behavior will not cease. It will likely escalate. That‚Äôs just how this stuff works. 

I haven‚Äôt spoken to my mother in a decade and never plan to again. She subjected us to abuse just as her mother did to her. She did nothing. She had her excuses, and trust me, they don‚Äôt matter. Don‚Äôt be that mother.

Honestly you and your husband should get into therapy ASAP. This shit‚Äôs genetic. Just sayin."

Every subsequent call gets treated with less and less importance, and that happens fast. She would quickly establish a reputation as being unreliable.

Ten years later, haven‚Äôt seen them in the flesh in a decade, and so much better off for it. I live over 2,000 miles away, and they don‚Äôt have my phone number. No contact is my saving grace, though you grieve that loss for a while afterwards.
