I can't say anything about the rest because I haven't seen any interviews and don't know that much about them.

But I feel the same about a different song from them. The lyrics I think are pretty plain, but wow. When I saw Catching Fire and the screen turned black at the end, Atlas started playing. Hearing that song with so many people in a giant room was otherworldly, I don't know. I just love the chord progression.

An old lady next to us was on her cell phone the whole time, chatting and going through her pictures - just what they would accuse young people of doing.

LetsTalkMusic,fdff7yy,t3_ekvvxp,1578360297.0,"I can totally relate. 

My mom always said no wonder I got depression as a teen after only listening to melancholic Gorillaz songs as a kid haha.

That was pretty much the only band I specifically sought out, other than listening to what's on the radio. In the 2000s, that was a lot of different stuff. My sister got into Green Day, Good Charlotte and Muse, so that's what I listened too. Also RHCP, Rammstein, then other influences like ELO, Gary Numan and Alan Parson from my dad. 

I became a weeb as a teen and that was around the time depression hit. Listened to a lot of Japanese stuff, also more indie stuff like Vampire Weekend, Django Django and Balthazar. Also James Blake and Pharrell.

Songs I can barely listen to nowadays are, well, one of them is Apartment by Young The Giant, especially the acoustic version. When I was too depressed to sleep, I used to listen to a late night talk show on the radio. This song came on and they talked about a very sad movie that deals with CSA, which I ended up watching. Kinda traumatizing but also helpful in realizing some stuff about me.
I went to a Gorillaz concert in 2010 and man, I always joked about my life being over now that I got to see them. That was like my only goal in life, and I actually made it. The entirety of Plastic Beach and The Fall gets me back into that depressive mindset.

The last few years I mostly listened to video game OSTs, mash ups (high quality rips hehe) and 80s pop in reference to other media I was enjoying, and somehow 80s pop kept appearing in a lot of things.

Then in 2018, my grandparents started to feel worse. My grandpa developed dementia and got put in a nursing home. Somehow I felt like I was at fault for this. My grandma's home alone now and she has a big history of mental illness, it's horrible having to deal with her every day and it drains our entire family. Around the same time, my other grandparents got worse too. Grandpa there's an alcoholic, also dementia, and grandma has all sorts of things you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy. Multiple kinds of cancer and stuff.

Around that time I discovered Metal. It felt really good to have someone else scream out the things you can't express on your own. I just always had trouble expressing myself. I started with more melodic songs and ended up seeking out the heaviest stuff. Slipknot, SOAD, Korn and Metallica distracted me from myself, but also led me to researching more about self-help and indulge in a lot more self-care.
A little bit later I got into Vaporwave and Future Funk and also listened to a lot of Chet Baker and Jungle. And the Beach Boys, Brian Wilson is a genius.

Two weeks ago, my grandma died (even though we had a kind of strained relationship, I'm still devastated) and I'm dealing with it through FNM and Mr Bungle. I was scared of a lot of songs at first and couldn't listen to them right after it happened, but that chaotic mess reflects my brain right now, I can't stop listening. I'm worried about going too far and actually going insane at some point, that's why I'm balancing it out right now, some heavy stuff and then more lighter, danceable songs."

I don't really have a solution for this, but there are two small things that help me a little bit. One is checking the news of the area where that person's supposed to be, if there are any accidents reported or stuff. If there's nothing new coming in, you're safe. The other thing is something my mom always said to me, if something happens, they'll notify you and you'll know soon enough. Someone will call or text you in an emergency. As long as that doesn't happen, you're safe. Sure, that leaves me with another underlying fear of someone calling, but at the same time feeling a bit more reassured.

asexuality,exf0t9k,t3_cscw3i,1566230027.0,"Probably around 2008. I remember sitting in our car with my mom and my sister, when she said that a friend recently told her that he's asexual. She didn't quite understand what he meant, but said ""Haha, what a loser, right? That's not normal!"" and then both kept laughing about it. 
I was curious about it, but dismissed the thoughts because I was highly conflicted. 
Being on tumblr the next few years made me question myself even more. Then a friend of mine told me she was asexual, around 2015, which led me to do more researching. I slowly identified with gray-ace, now it's aroace for me."

I got a little bit too excited today about trying some new exercises someone over on r/loseit recommended. Back in February I tried an app focused on easy leg workouts, only made it to Day 20 before I gave up. It's something like Yoga and... very light cardio combined I think. Today was Day 7, but I didn't do it and instead switched over to the new website. Did like 120 Jumping Jacks and 80 High Knees and... threw up a little. Oh boy, I'll probably switch back to the app for tomorrow :D"

Team_Io,etj2dl3,t3_c9flui,1562864836.0,"I've been thinking about joining the challenge for days now, yesterday I finally decided to do it. Hey everyone! I'm yonjyuuni, 22F.

I think I discovered r/loseit back in February and downloaded MFP right away, unfortunately I didn't stick to it. In May I started over again, now I'm at day 54 of consecutive logging. I even lost 8 pounds already! I'm really surprised myself. Thanks to checking the sub daily, I don't get discouraged as easily as before. Reading about plateaus and whooshes helped to calm me down if I was feeling stuck. 

I've been overweight for... at least 10 years now. And now that I think about it, maybe it had something to do with the meds I had to take. I took them for five years, at the beginning under supervision with regulated meals and exercise twice a week. I was at my lowest weight back then, around 127 pounds I think. After that, being at home and eating whatever I could get my hands on, combined with stress and no exercise, I kept gaining weight until I was at almost 200 pounds. When I stopped taking them, I pretty much held that weight for the next few years, except for some small fluctuations. I never really made any attempts at changing my lifestyle or diet or anything, I thought it wouldn't work for me, since I never saw anything through to the end, despite wanting to lose weight all the time. One time I had the opportunity to talk with a nutritionist, but being the stubborn teen I was, it ended after one meeting because I thought I wouldn't learn anything new. We just discussed the food pyramid and stuff about macros.

So yeah. Stats: 5'5"", SW: 180 lbs, CW: 172 lbs GW: 140 lbs
For the challenge, my goal would be to finally hit 165 lbs.

I really love memes, video games, anime and manga. And... Pluto is kinda nice.
I get really anxious whenever I post something, so I'm mostly just lurking. But I enjoy reading :D Thanks for all your input and I hope we'll have fun over the next weeks!"

You're right, I'm still exhausted from that week but a little bit proud. I've been avoiding sleeping at hotels since forever, I even took a night train after a concert that took 6 hours to get home, just to avoid the hotel. So... yeah.

I'm really sorry about that thing with your mom. First hating on anime and then skipping work because of it? Wow, I have no words. 
Oh yeah, he does that too, making jokes about my little sister and me for liking anime despite watching Captain Future himself. 
When I asked him what he thought he was going to hear that night he said he just knew they were wearing masks, so he thought it was ""one of your strange anime music things"". What is that even supposed to mean?

That's exactly why I'm afraid of speaking my mind, he'll also refuse to talk to me or just go outside without telling me where he's going. How do you deal with that? 
He's also like that to my mom, if she won't drop everything she's doing atm and listen to him completely he'll get angry and ignore her for two days.

How can someone say that to their own daughter?? Especially when she dealt with the same things. I just don't get it. I mean everyone must have at least a little bit of empathy, even for strangers. But doing that to your own family... no one should have to deal with that.

I really hope your sister is doing better now. And I'm really proud of you for cutting her out of your life. Toxic people should have no more business in our lives. I hope you'll both find people that appreciate you the way you are, you deserve it.

Thanks again for your reply, and also good luck!"

The thing is, this week we went to a Beach Boys concert together which he planned, and I really really like them, but he went out of his way to remind me every few minutes how much better they are, what an unforgettable experience this was and so on. He even bought two things at the merch booth (he's really cheap usually, wait okay I had to give him my money, he didn't have enough) and he shoved the videos he made in my face at home, still does today. When I asked him about photos and videos from our trip, he only gave me the ones of the famous sights, nothing from Slipknot, so I had to get his camera myself to get them.

Thank you for your reply though, I didn't think anyone would read this! :)"

Kids and teenagers can be so cruel, I can't wrap my head around that. I'm really sorry this happened to you.

But keep up the good work! You already made huge progress, something they wouldn't be able to do. You've got strength that they lack. You worked hard and changed something that bothered you about yourself, while they're still stuck with their shitty attitudes that won't get them far in life.

AskReddit,epa9xcl,t3_bu766u,1559124524.0,"I had a lot of shitty experiences with teachers, some of them were talking shit about me and my parents in front of the class when I was sick at home. 

I can't remember why, but our P.E. teacher in primary school got fired. Then in 7th grade, another one was fired, this time it was our history teacher. I remember the first time he came into our classroom, I was sitting close to the door, he looked at me and mumbled something, I couldn't understand him and thought it was nothing. But he kept standing there, and was now yelling. ""Your scarf!!"" I was like... what 
""Take off your scarf!"" 
I was so perplexed, I didn't know what to do.
""All girls in this class, take off your scarfs now. It's spring, we're indoors, there's no need to wear scarfs here."" I hated him. He did this every lesson.

But the worst one was our P.E. teacher in 5th grade who stayed until 8th grade. We had swimming lessons back then and had to walk to the swimming pools. One day I felt uncomfortable because he was following me close behind, halfway there he told me he was watching me and noticed that my walking was strange and that I probably had a foot malposition and should get that checked out.
I told my mom (who took every advice) and she took me to a orthopedist who eventually said everything was fine.
One time at the pool, he held up a hoop where we had to jump through with our head first. Everyone managed to do this, but when it was my turn, he held the hoop a little higher. I got stuck and fell into the water with the hoop still around me and almost pulled him with me, which made everyone laugh.

Another thing that happened in regular P.E. was an exercise with parallel bars. I barely got it right, but he thought it wasn't perfect yet. All the other kids had to do it once, I had to do it several times, he wouldn't let me go. I wanted to get it over with, but hurt my spine on the bars. I started crying and said I wanted to quit and that I couldn't do it, he said 'you can do it, you just can't do it ""yet""'. All the others were standing still and watching me, but luckily no one was laughing this time. But my back hurt for days."
