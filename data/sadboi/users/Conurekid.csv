I did block this person, but unfortunately, that really only stops them from messaging me directly. They can still interact with me on the forums. I am definitely going to report the account, but I’m not really sure what to say in my report since this account in particular has not done anything yet. 

Thank you for your input. I am trying to get to the bottom of this."

AskReddit,f9i1zdd,t1_f7qcflx,1575326381.0,"Late reply, but this same exact thing happened to me several years ago when I went to see the second Purge movie with my mom and sister. A guy came in late to the movie and spent the whole time fidgeting under this giant jacket—when he was in the theater. He left several times. He did have his phone with him, so it’s possible he was just fiddling on that and trying not to be distracting about it. But his behavior as a whole just seemed really off and creeped me out, especially since the theater was pretty crowded. We ended up leaving, and my sister made fun of me for making a big about it. In truth, it probably was nothing—just some weird guy who couldn’t sit still. Maybe he had something going on. I don’t know. And it very very likely turned out to be nothing. Still, I just felt uneasy about it and am glad we left."

AskReddit,f0qwcr4,t3_d64oct,1568867973.0,"December 23rd, 2017. It was around 9pm. My mom had a hemorrhagic stroke. Fortunately, both my sister and I were home with her when it happened and could call 911 immediately. In all honesty, those couple days after the stroke were probably truly the worst—not knowing what was going to happen and being terrified to asleep in case something happened in the middle of the night.

It’s been almost 2 years, and considering the type of stroke it was and size of it, my mother has made a remarkable recovery. She can speak just as she had pre-stroke, can walk pretty well (with a cane), and is overall doing very well. However, she is still paralyzed on the right side of course and probably won’t ever gain full control over that hand (although she can use it, just not fully; some doctors didn’t think that would happen at all). I’m very grateful that she has come so far. But I wouldn’t wish that day (well, night) and days following on my worst enemy."
