mentalhealth,fb54uih,t3_dyh281,1576521001.0,"UPDATE
There‚Äôs is a pending investigation upon my abuser, they are monitoring his every move( when they find the time). Also the last month has been a roller coaster ride, I had school speeches essays and finals ect. All while I‚Äôm in debt cause I can‚Äôt work cause of the extra school( my boss doesn‚Äôt understand how mental health works and schedules me for 2-3 hour shifts so I can study but it‚Äôs all the hard labor shit) and ect. I was studying on my couch, so to nurse my bad back I would bring my pillow out here on the couch. I‚Äôve been sleeping here for about three weeks. 

I GOT AN A in business speech class I FAILED 6 years ago. 
I got a B in a philosophy class 
I got  B in Government. 

I dropped out of school for 4 years. And I came back and still did that! 

And the cherry on top, while studying I‚Äôve been deep cleaning the house. Yesterday I cleaned my room for the first time in over 2 years, washed my sheets and pillows and covers.... and slept. Not just napped, but slept with my heart at ease. 

I love you guys, sending positive vibes to all of y‚Äôall!
Thanks for the kind words in the OP!"

Step by step you will claw and claw and drag yourselves from the demons. Resist them. Your better self must remain strong and centered as you do. Everyone has the darkness and light in them, a ying and a yang. 
Let your light overcome the darkness in whatever way possible, seek help through family, therapists, but if your having those thoughts do one thing. Talk to someone. In your case I‚Äôd say family. If they shun you, send me a DM and we can talk. Everything‚Äôs gonna be alright, if we band together as a unit. Ily random redditor ‚úåüèºüôèüèº"

A hero‚Äôs definition is someone who would sacrifice their life for a person, a cause. After a few near death experiences after dealing with that from the start, you can go down a black hole of depression and self doubt. But once you realize you can talk to people about your problems instead of just drinking or pill popping away, life become much happier. I can actually drink every now and again and get a little buzz where I‚Äôd used to drink a double bottle of wine or a bottle of whiskey but hardly feel tipsy unless I slammed the drinks or combined them with pills, which is way riskier. Now I‚Äôm on med that level me out, the pain is still there.
