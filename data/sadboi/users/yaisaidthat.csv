But you didn't answer my question. How many total environments do you have for user content, and how many render the virtual screen to a compositor layer?

>it’s extremely hard to guarantee perfect 24/30fps video when it’s a desktop screenshare streaming from a user’s laptop to a dozen people in real-time

That's because you're confusing frame dropping with judder. Those are two separate issues. It doesn't matter how the content reaches the screen, there will always be judder if you don't have proper synchronization.

>The room hosts regularly will drop a few frames of their desktop screenshare, and that’s exactly what you’re perceiving as reduced video quality in user rooms

I'm talking about a world-locked compositor layer for the virtual screen.

And no, I'm not referring to frame skips, I'm referring to synchronization.

I never said it was. Displaying video content on a compositor layer is the ONLY way to (almost) eliminate judder. Being the only tool for the job doesn't make it magic."

My chief complaint isn't the crappy quality, it's the crappy synchronization. If every room uses a compositor layer (they don't), then you're doing something seriously wrong somewhere in the pipeline.

And like most digital connections, errors require packets to be dropped or corrected. The longer the cable, the higher the potential for signal degradation. The same goes with the quality of the cable (materials, gauge etc). The lower the quality, the higher the potential for signal degradation.

> 3% (150Mbps) of the 5Gbps available with USB 3.0

The maximum theoretical bandwidth by spec is not the same as the actual bandwidth in practice. The actual bandwidth and signal quality in practice is based on multiple factors, such as the length and quality of the USB cable being used.

>The cable is not the bottleneck, the performance of the Quest's video decode hardware is.

They are both potential bottlenecks for different reasons.  

>The Oculus cable will have no impact on image quality. It will look the same no matter what cable you us

That is objectively false. A cable that is experiencing signal degradation will not look the same as a cable that isn't.. All those people complaining about the screen glitching out for a second are experiencing packet loss as a result of the cable being used. They're probably also experiencing tracking glitches and latency they wouldn't experience with a cable less prone to signal degradation."

Then that tells me that you're not here arguing in good faith. No one in their right mind would believe that a single indie dev invests more resources than a massive company like nvidia who also sells hardware that is reliant on this technology.

>and when their next update breaks backwards compatibility again, will there be a dev around willing to update Moonlight again? 

Backwards compatibility is not what breaks, that doesn't even really make sense. [but yes](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-android/releases) it is always updated, and will always be updated because it's open source and in high demand. Higher demand than VD is and ever will be.

>But we were talking about SteamVR and I'm not sure GameStream is very relevant there.

We're talking about an app that supports both Flat and VR streaming. Gamestream is better for flat streaming, ALVR is better for VR streaming by any objective benchmarks. Feel free to post some benchmarks proving me wrong.

>They all implement NVENC

Irrelevant. Gamestream has better capture performance, and does everything on a much lower level, which avoids bottlenecks such as interop and function call overhead. It also clearly has a much better network protocol, lower latency gamepad support, and better audio support. These things matter if you're interested in playing games instead of the ""light activities"" VD was advertised for.

>but I have doubts that ALVR implements the GameStream protocol.

You're correct, and nobody said it does. The main feature of VD is desktop streaming. Hence ""Virtual Desktop"".

>Besides, there are more aspects to consider. We have VR-specific stuff like timewarp techniques that could greatly improve the experience

Which both ALVR and Moonlight make use of.  

>ALVR still has issues with controller orientation in the latest alpha, I believe, and a crash bug on exit

""I believe"" is the operative statement. Pointing out bugs in an alpha release that are pretty much guaranteed to get fixed isn't a very good benchmark when we're comparing performance. VD also has plenty of bugs, especially server-side.

>And we don't get any promises from polygraphene that he'll be able to consistently work on the project, nor are there a huge number of contributors willing to help.

It's more guaranteed than a closed-source app by a single dev that only exists on the app store. If that dev disappears over night, so does the project. That's not the case with ALVR or Moonlight."
