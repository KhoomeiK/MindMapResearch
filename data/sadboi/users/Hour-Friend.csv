NoStupidQuestions,fjrmf94,t1_fjrl853,1583587411.0,">As the inner foreskin separates from the glans, some areas may remain attached. These attachments are called adhesions. Most boys will have adhesions at some time. As the inner foreskin continues to separate, these adhesions usually break down on their own. By the age of 17, they should have all disappeared. The adhesions **should not be forcefully broken down â€“ time and normal exploratory behaviour will take care of them as your child ages.**

No, don't force it, OP \~ either ""exploratory behaviour"" takes care of it eventually or it comes off naturally

Go to a doctor if you're too old (>18) to fit this condition though"
