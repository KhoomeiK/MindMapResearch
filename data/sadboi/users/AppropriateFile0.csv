depression,fr65aih,t3_gmuiot,1589920164.0,"I learned something over the years in a similar situation I'd like to share. Nobody WANTS to be a bad parent. Your parents are not ""TOXIC"" on purpose. You have to look at their history and circumstances to find out why they act a certain way. Being angry at people is always a waste of time and NEVER changes anything. They are who they are because of how they grew up. The best you can do is lead by example and even be nice to them because chances are that they might hate themselves and have other internal issues too. You will be much happier in your own life knowing that instead of fighting with your family, you show compassion, patience and understanding no matter how bad they act out. You're still young and I can tell you will turn out just fine if you are asking these sorts of questions and thinking about things. Just remember that anger doesn't solve anything, anger only fuels more anger. 

Become the parent you wish you had. Set a good example. Be patient, loving and understanding of others situations. I think you'll do great naturally. Don't even worry about it."

depression,fqwcbiv,t1_fqvaqeg,1589699421.0,"My six years at sbux actually made me develop first ever panic attacks, anxiety and depression. Over the years I've watched many young adults go from optimistic and healthy to picking up bad habits and developing pretty severe anxiety/sleep disorders within a year of working at starbucks. It happened to everyone. I wonder how many young adults get stuck in these jobs and have their mental and physical health ruined.

With Covid, I've been not working for the first time in all those years. It took about two months for my brain to re-adjust to not having to go there for my daily abusive grind. I didn't know what to do with the free time. That's how these jobs destroy our young adults. The key is that there's an adjustment period for the brain. At first, I wasn't sure what to do with myself and ended up gaining weight and still feeling depressed. Now, however, I noticed that I'm naturally getting into doing daily tasks and healthy routines and even reaching out to old friends. I'm beginning to feel ""free"" for the first time in years. In fact, I can't even remember those agonizing feelings I used to dread so much when at work. The negative feelings have faded and that translates into my daily life now.

Now, I've always been a super healthy person. I believe that having a healthy body means you can experience a more energetic and better life and that is probably why I was able to endure such a long time at starbucks. I pushed myself against the grain to exercise and continue to eat healthy despite being absolutely wrecked every day from the stress of work. 

At this point, I don't think I will go back. Freedom is so much better than wage slavery. I do not care if I have to be homeless and just hike across America. I will take that over jobs that slowly dehumanize you day-after-day as you feel your mental and physical state degrade. I'd rather have no material possessions than be a slave given crumbs by a mocking upper class."

DO NOT buy the ROGAINE foam. Buy the generic liquid that comes with a dropper. It is much more effective because it goes directly to the scalp instead of the hair.

YOU WILL go through ""phases"" using this stuff religiously. This means that at first you will shed a bit but you must keep with the regimen. Then it will grow back a little and then it will shed again. After a few cycles of this it will eventually grow back REALLY thick and nice hairs. You will have hair that looks better than when you were in your twenties. 

IT WILL NOT work forever! I've been on it since I was about 25 and for about five years of use it gave me the best hair I've ever had BUT even though I still use it as before, now that I'm in my 30's it has finally caught up with me and my hair has returned to pre-minoxidil days. It is what it is. 

You will enjoy great hair with Minoxidil but only for a few years and after that it will lose effectiveness.

Don't over do it. This is a long-term game. It's about persistence.

It may be that who you become depends entirely on your brains automatic responses to it's environment contrasted and compared to memory of past experiences. Those who say they worked hard to get where they are and that anyone can do it too aren't entirely correct. The hard work came naturally to them in their circumstances and environment which provided quick, accurate feedback and reward. 

Those who are born in poverty are very likely to remain in poverty. Whereas those born into large and supportive families with lots of connections will obviously do much better in life naturally. 

A UBI is most definitely needed for many reasons, one of them being that in our economy many people are left behind. Having depressed and anxious brains within a system is a burden to the whole.
