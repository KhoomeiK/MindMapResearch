pharmacy,fqdq63n,t1_fqdbg9w,1589294643.0,"Refills in the US pharmacy system is like...say a doctor prescribes the patient some blood pressure drugs. Most meds are written for 1 month supply at a time...and refills are additional monthly fills.  So a year‚Äôs worth of drugs would be like one prescription plus 11 refills.  And that gets entered into the system so that the patient can come back each month in the pharmacy and get their next month‚Äôs fill without having to go back to the doctor.  After all refills are filled...it‚Äôs time for patient to come back to doctor for another checkup. 

Nowadays...most scripts are pushed to be written for 90-days worth at a time. So a years worth of a prescription would be like...1 prescription of 90-day supply plus 3 additional refills of 90-days supply. (90-days x 4 fills = about a year).
