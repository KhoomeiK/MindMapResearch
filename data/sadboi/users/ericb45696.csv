2) I'm not sure how many different types there are, but the vinyl heat transfer foil type might be a detectable thickness compared to the  standard heat transfer foil ? I'd say you should be fine with the thinner non-vinyl heat transfer foil.

3) Not necessary to use a die. You can use a heat transfer 'pen' they sell pretty cheap, but those are really difficult to work with in my experience. Iron should work. The foil is somewhat unwieldy so you would need a way to use a stencil maybe and just any flat surface but with something roughly the shape of the disc like an upside down pan? to support the disc when you apply the iron.  I'd strongly recommend getting a few test discs :)"

discgolf,fpv9hur,t1_fpuqhsg,1588939237.0," First off, the collector market is crazy, has been for the last 6-7 years or so. It's really taken off and prices can be very wonky, and very much as the saying goes 'it's worth whatever someone will pay for it'.  edit: ack, hope that didnt sound too preachy, I shouldnt make assumptions .


 Also keep in mind for some there is whats called an 'auction' price and a 'raffle' price, with raffles usually getting more $$ than a straight sale depending on the disc slightly.


 Having said all that , in the condition it's in , and even though it is what I would consider a somewhat 'rare' collectable disc, the value is just not there right now. Not a huge demand, and finding a new condition one is still relatively easy if one so desires. $10-15 would be my guess. A new one would probably be in the $25-50 range depending on some things.  

 A little more info about them. [This](https://www.disczump.com/files/5a820b34be625465e0591454) was the card that came with a special run of 1000 with no stamp or markings. I think I paid about $30 for [it](https://www.disczump.com/files/5a820b08be625465e0591448) a few years ago. I'm not sure on how many of the Transcend first run stamp were made, but I think it came after their other disc , the Quarter K came out. I'll admit I thought that disc was pretty cool for about 5 minutes. People are not exaggerating when you hear stories of it taking one tree hit and being fubar. But I swear it flew awesome for about three throws!

 Cool disc though, a piece of history."
