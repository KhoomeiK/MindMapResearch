Amelia goes down easy if you slash at her limbs, and will open for viscerals. Leveled up saw cleaver or saw spear with firepaper is really good for this."

I've used hylaronic acid the longest, and I really love it, definately helps with moisture. I feel like my skin always has a healthy glow now, and my t-zone doesnt feel oily :)

I think the combination of these have definitely made my skin look smoother. After I started using niacinamide ( about two weeks ago) ive noticed ive gained spots in certain places, but I think its purging and not breaking out. But I'm still unsure, i guess time will tell :)"

I also had planned a trip to visit my best friend, and even if I was skeptical bc I had been so low at that time, I think surrounding myself with those I love really turned it around for me.

Shortly afterwards I visited my hometown too, and spent some time in our cabin which is my favorite place in the world. Being in nature away from the busy city is an underrated way of therapy I think, everyone who finds the possibility should try it!"

What has helped me is focus on myself, through steadily bettering my self-image and confidence, work out more, getting better at things I used to suck at (cooking for example) and appreciate little things in life.

No one can understand, no one can relate and everyone is either dismissive of her or pity her. She has lost everyone she loves, and the one person left who is supposed to love her, doesn't appreciate her at all. 

Although I've never been in a relationship like hers really, I can relate to not feeling heard or acknowledged, and then when there's a society that wants Dani to be part of their family and who gives her the affection and attention she's been missing, it feels cathartic."
