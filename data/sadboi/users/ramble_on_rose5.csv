AmItheAsshole,foz8vi5,t3_gaa8t7,1588186626.0,"YTA for sure. You don't get to choose what your girlfriend wears or who she decides to be. Perhaps she has been too timid to wear ""loud"" clothes in the past, and she is becoming more confident with herself. In case you aren't sure, that's a good thing."
fixedeyebrows,fojk1wa,t1_fojcuyd,1587822963.0,Definitely had this feeling as well.

I understand her statement but she should have looked into it further as a possible symptom of OPs declining mental health if not the medical condition."
mentalhealth,flyc1fl,t1_flxzkux,1585599341.0,"Definitely agree with you here. The woman on the line should have handed the call off if it was over her head. Instead, she took it personally which proves she isnt stable enough to be in this position. I'm worried for how many other people she is brushing off who need the crisis line."

Healthyhooha,flge5vu,t3_fog0k9,1585140235.0,"If you're planning to look into laser hair removal, check out a dermatology office with a medical spa. They often have trained aestheticians that use the laser under guidance from a doctor and tend to have higher tech lasers."
Healthyhooha,flevlvc,t3_fodfmm,1585092422.0,Birth control can make us more prone to pH imbalances which can cause an overgrowth of yeast (yeast infection) or overgrowth of bacterial (bacterial vaginitis). I'd recommend getting a culture done to be sure.
Healthyhooha,fl8l4us,t1_fl8j7xb,1584926216.0,Unfortunately no. I see some women on here recommending boric acid suppositories but I wouldn't recommend it without research first at least.

It could be bacterial vaginosis. If this is the case, you'll likely need an antibiotic."

Dermatology,f7mgki0,t3_dwleuk,1573862721.0,It looks dysplastic though. Would have it excised and tested if it were me.
Dermatology,f7mga2z,t3_dwz1ln,1573862494.0,"The mole nevi, the more chances for atypical moles or melanoma. Not much significance there. Probably just him noting it."
Dermatology,f7mg12k,t1_f7lh4ow,1573862302.0,Agreed. Another possible diagnosis is sebaceous hyperplasia which is just an enlarged oil gland.
Dermatology,f1rdwmd,t1_f1r9440,1569714472.0,This. It looks just like versicolor.

Dermatology,eyn1bhh,t3_cxjpfi,1567227316.0,Keratosis Pilaris. You can use a lotion with urea or a glycolic acid wash/moisurturizer/toner to the areas to help promote exfoliation to smoothe these bumps a bit.
Dermatology,eyn14x0,t3_cxku97,1567227106.0,Not molluscum. Looks more like Keratosis Pilaris. Also itching can irritate hair follicles and those areas may raise up from the repeated friction.
Dermatology,eyn0xhf,t3_cxjdgu,1567226878.0,It looks like a slightly atypical mole which sometimes can lead to cancer down the road. Best to have a dermatologist's office take a look and possibly biopsy.
