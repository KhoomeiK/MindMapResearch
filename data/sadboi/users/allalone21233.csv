I only put “little things” in quotations because they may seem small to someone who isn’t suffering from depression but feels insurmountable to us depressed people. 

Great job! :)"
depression,f3j0lap,t3_dh5piq,1570945078.0,This is seriously huge!! I hope to do the same soon!
depression,f3dg1wb,t1_f3bgstt,1570836264.0,I’m getting a dog for the very reason that I want something to wake up next to in the morning. I’m hoping she helps lift the crippling sense of dread for the day ahead.
depression,f1ij3qx,t1_f1i3fci,1569511111.0,Maybe we can find solace in that our true friends/family members will still be there when we come out of this funk
depression,f1frp4y,t3_d99rec,1569451446.0,Down to chat!
depression,f1foeew,t3_d98vrk,1569449049.0,"I feel this 1000%. I so badly want to smile and laugh with friends again but at the same time, isolate myself and ignore people. I don’t feel like I deserve happiness or friendships so I push people away. It’s a constant battle in my head - the good guys wanting to be around others and the bad guys saying that I’ll never be happy even if I’m with other people"

depression,f1ew9eo,t1_f1cv3ql,1569431682.0,"This sounds extremely difficult so I’m sorry you have to endure the pain of her moving on. Always remember that there is a possibility your paths will cross later down the road. Whenever I have lost a girlfriend, sometimes even if I was the one who ended it, I felt as if I would never be able to find anyone like her ever again but that wasn’t true. 

It sounds like you have a great friend at church who checked up on you in your time of need. Maybe focus on your friendships instead of a romantic relationship right now. That’s what I’m trying to do!"
depression,f1cuqzz,t1_f1cu5dm,1569366384.0,"My friend had a good analogy - it’s hard to fill someone else’s cup when yours is empty. Sometimes it’s good to have a little space so you two can work on yourselves and be better for each other later. 

I’m trying to treat my situation as a lesson that no one can truly make you happy except for yourself."
ADHD,f167kbv,t1_f162281,1569204543.0,Did you end up going off the depression meds and onto adhd meds?
ADHD,f167gfb,t1_f164jxc,1569204457.0,The overlapping symptoms apparently make it tough for doctors to diagnose?
ADHD,f161vpr,t1_f161pyi,1569200672.0,That’s great to hear you were able to tackle your depression! It’s too bad those co-morbid friends aren’t all that friendly lol
