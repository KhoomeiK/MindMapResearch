Advice,firkhuw,t3_f9hh8o,1582666103.0,"Maybe keep track of the consistency of your interest in shaving your head. For example, write down today’s date, and ask yourself if you want to shave your hair. Do this once a week, and see if your perspective on the matter changes. If you still want to shave your head after a significant period of time passes (and you can decide how long that period of time should be), then totally go for it. This way, you’ll know it’s something you have wanted to do consistently and it won’t be impulsive. If you find that your opinion on the matter changes over time, then it will be good that you took time to consider.

Generally I’ve found that having such a strong interest in doing something like that, especially if it has lasted for a while, will only persist. You may have doubts about it over time, but really we are only living this one life. Might as well do what you want to your hair :)"

offmychest,fejy9a6,t1_fejxip2,1579188582.0,"You are telling yourself that you are lazy, but that doesn’t mean that is true. No one is completely lazy, or worthless, etc etc. You may not always achieve the things that you’d like to achieve, or you may spend a lot of time doing things that seem of little value to you, but you have the ability to change things. If I were you I’d start with positive affirmations (which may feel silly at first), cut out the negative labels like “lazy.” Because if you tell yourself that you are lazy, then you are going to believe it and your actions will reflect it. It doesn’t mean that you are inherently lazy. Does that make sense?"

offmychest,fdt7el1,t3_en1yh0,1578712897.0,"I’ve heard that CBD oil can do wonders for chronic pain. Personally, it helps a lot with my anxiety. It might be worth looking into if you haven’t given it a try yet. Medical marijuana also seems to have similar, possibly even more powerful, effects (although I haven’t tried it)

Another aspect of this is the “can’t” mindset. You CAN break the cycle of your diet. You truly can, even if you don’t believe it. Try changing one small thing of your diet this week, whether it’s drinking only water, eating one healthy snack every day, etc. It’s possible (and even likely) that having a healthier diet could alleviate some of your other symptoms.

Trying to change everything all at once will not work— it will only be overwhelming and discouraging. Self care is a long process, and it certainly doesn’t happen overnight. It happens in small increments; little victories that gradually become big achievements. So it’s incredibly important to remember this, and to be patient and compassionate with yourself along the way"
