TooAfraidToAsk,fqo9gq3,t1_fqo1vz7,1589510339.0,"Thanks for the thoughtful response again. I wanted to note that I am not a teenager (but had a lot of crazy emotions as a teen). I did have to go to therapy as a teenager because my parents assumed I was holding in anger regarding their divorce (I guess I was). I am in my mid-30s now and have never really grasped how to deal with anger (or how to convey my anger without yelling or being verbally abusive, I guess). I grew up that way. I have been getting better at learning how to be more emotionally mature but there are always little setbacks.

What gets me is that these setbacks, or these intense rages, come and the second they are done I become extremely depressed. I feel guilty for allowing myself get that way, I feel depressed that I would treat anyone close to me like that, and I begin the self-deprecating self-talk about how I'd be better off alone (like, my husband deserves better obviously and he should find better).

Either way, I was really interested in how anger can take over the body. I can't even describe how I feel when I am angry because there is just so much things going on. The elevated heart-rate, the logic processes shutting down, the ""fuming"", etc.

Expectations are probably about 99% of the reason I get angry. I do know I expect a lot from people and should give them a break. Even some of those expectations are hard for me to achieve so I definitely shouldn't expect everyone to be so perfect because I most definitely am not.

I was able to curb my anger today though and that made me feel like maybe I am on to something. I communicated that I was getting to the point of losing it (again, expectations weren't met and I got angry) and excused myself to be alone for 5 minutes. I did breathing exercises and meditated (something I need to start trying to do more). It actually did work. I came back to the problem and was able to figure it out after I cleared my head."

>Do you take regular Zyrtec or Zyrtec-D? Zyrtec-D gave me insomnia due to the pseudoephedrine. Regular Zyrtec (Cetirizine) doesn‚Äôt make me sleepy, so I usually take Diphenhydramine (Brand name is Benadryl) when I have trouble sleeping. Diphenhydramine should make you sleepier than cetirizine as diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine. Another first-generation antihistamine is doxylamine succinate.

I take regular but I also do take diphenhydramine on days it is really bad. Unfortunately, however, I notice it dries out my skin and (this is TMI, I know) my vagina. I try not to take it very much because of this.

I didn't know this. Does that mean CBD also causes you to not get proper sleep/REM sleep? I am taking drops right know that only total about 4mg THC with 2mg of CBD and 1mg pf CBN.

Unfortunately none of our doors have locks on them (we rent) but we do have a baby gate in the hallway that I could close (I was mainly just worried about emergencies). We did get a clock for our kid. It turns green at 7a for wake up time but he is getting up during the yellow period (630a). I also reiterated to stay in his bed or room until the green light is on and only get me in case of emergencies (sick feeling, nightmare, etc.) I think it is the nightlight too. He likes sleeping with one but it keeps his room so bright that I think it makes him think it is time to wake up when he normally awakens in the night.

After my mental breakdown and bawling, I talked to my husband about what we can do. Not just about the kid waking up but my shitty sleep in general.
