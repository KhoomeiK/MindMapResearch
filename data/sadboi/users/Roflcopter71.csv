The CPC has been comfortable with being a united party and knows it doesn’t stand a chance at governing if it fragments back to the PC and Reform days. The PPC tried this and look where that got them. Any smart politician eyeing the leadership who has any desire to be PM one day can take advantage of this and align with the issues that moderates agree with. The benefits of trying to capture the moderate voters outweighs the negatives of losing any right-wing voters because they won’t be able to vote for anyone else.
