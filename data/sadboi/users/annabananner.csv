Please don’t underestimate how much of a drain this current toxic environment can have on you physically, I’ve been there too and I felt like i slept for hours and hours on end just to escape. Don’t get too down on yourself for this, it’s your body’s self preservation, just like when you’re tired because you’re sick and fighting an infection.

Please don’t underestimate how much better it can get, either. If it’s possible to get out of there once the quarantine madness is over, plan for that. Even tiny steps that you can take now will be better than doing nothing at all. If you can save just a bit, start to pack your things, or do some work on your resume to hunt for jobs when you can - do it! The time is going to go by anyway, I promise you’ll feel better if you can help yourself now, even in small ways :)

The church has retained a lawyer, who’s asked CA governor Gavin Newsom to declare churches “essential” in the state, and therefore exempt from the stay-at-home order, but at this time they are still subject to it so gathering in the church is not allowed.

To add to everyone else’s recommendations, I’d also say waterproofing is important in keeping warm. 
I bought a couple cans of silicone gear sealer from the sporting goods section at walmart (i think it was like $5) and treated my outer layers, boots, mittens, etc. with it -  even if they were already water resistant. It really helped keep everything dry below my outer shell layer!

As far as gear recommendations, I find mittens keep my hands warmer - I got these [trigger finger mittens](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FDYQ6K6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_7a2IEbB44W789) and they’re working out pretty well. I gave em a spritz with the waterproofing spray because wet mittens are a true nightmare.

I basically wore the same 2 pairs of pants as my outer layer for the whole trip - I alternated between [insulated ski pants](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JCJNWMK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_Nr2IEbBBKARPK)  and [waterproof softshell pants](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08278VX5L/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_rv2IEbYWVG8ZS) put on over everything else. They helped block the wind, which was huge. I also treated these with silicone waterproofing spray. 

Lastly - I put a fresh pair of [these insoles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UQXAT6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_wx2IEb0M9CW7P)  in my boots every day."
