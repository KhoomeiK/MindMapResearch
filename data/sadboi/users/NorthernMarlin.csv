The remnants of the Imperium have reestablished themselves on the outskirts of the Galaxy, relocating Terra to a new system. The Admech and Imperial Navy have joined forces to spearhead massive evacuations, carrying trillions of Imperial citizens out of harm's way. For the time being the forces of Chaos are kept from finishing their campaign against the Imperium by the awakening of every tomb world. The necrons, in turn, are buckling under the strain of fighting a two-front war against Chaos from within the Galaxy, and the arrived main force of the Tyranids from without. The Eldar have fully retreated into the webway, focusing the efforts of their entire species on the awakening of Ynnead. This has left a power vacuum that the Tau have capitalized on to expand their empire rapidly, which they must do if they hope to survive against the many seemingly insurmountable threats assailing the galaxy."" 

Or maybe the nids arrive but almost as soon as they begin their invasion, whatever it is they're fleeing from also arrives and begins to attack them. What if it's something WORSE than Chaos?

However, I think we just have different lenses through which we're viewing the same thing. I see his actions as unethical because i don't believe the ends ever justify the means. Trying to keep the existence of Chaos from the Primarchs?? That was both unethical and stupid. Killing the Thunder Warriors and then covering it up? Extremely unethical. Letting Angron's followers be massacred? Unforgivable. Maybe he's not an evil prick like I tend to characterize him, but he's incredibly manipulative of those that trust him and is willing to use any means to achieve his goals, and that seems pretty evil to me. 

My other point was that, if he still uses his power to guide mankind, why couldn't he guide them away from the Imperial Cult? I'm fully aware of Lorgar's heretical book, I just don't think it would've posed much problem to the Emperor if he's as powerful as people say he is and he can psychically guide and protect mankind from beyond the grave.  

And I'm not trying to get in a flame war or anything, I just really like discussing this kind of stuff. Just so we're on the same page of ""friendly debate"". I know my language can get a little heated at times, so you'll have to forgive me if I sound too one-sided."
