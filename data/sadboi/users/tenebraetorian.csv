PurplePillDebate,f8fazxq,t3_e0l0me,1574541027.0,"To control, I would have to have an ultimate aim. If I am being controlled, that means there is an ultimate aim that I do not understand, being part of the mechanism that enacts the goal. I do not have reference for what happens outside of the framework that encapsulates me. If I act to exert influence over what happens inside of the frame in which I exist, do I work against or for the controller? How can I act outside of my own programming? 

I only wish to learn to exert control over my own sphere of influence. My brain was not created with the capacity for understanding things that I do not yet understand. To control life is to assume that capacity and to take responsibility for things outside of your own realm of concept. 

If you don't plan for eventualities, those eventualities will most probably eventually happen. That's why problem solving is best done in teams. Others have capacity that adds to my own. 

If I were a god, we'd be a family that fought for what we felt was right and against what we felt was wrong. That would mean that the things wrong for me would be made wrong for everyone. If I felt something was bad without the conceptual ability to understand the necessity for that object, I'd do away with it at my own peril for sake of fighting the good fight and that thing could lead to the destruction of my creation."

I admit I'm at a loss. The attention grabber is the byline - in all caps is shouting, the false flag presented in my question means that the audience is grabbed by a false sense of importance.

I did, because I wanted to know what the slime in my mouth was about and why I couldn't taste anything for an hour or more after brushing my teeth. It's because the chemicals in the paste were literally eating the soft tissues of my mouth. That was the residual slime - the dead parts left from using caustic chemicals.

Houses lie dormant and empty because people can't afford them. That's okay, they've no rights. They're a blight for existing. They're bad people because they're having trouble, and it's not my problem.

We have formula. Formula only works if you don't need to feel. Feeling isn't rational. Emotion isn't structured. We treat life as a commodity and wonder why we aren't feeling connected. Go to the mall and buy your instant emotions. Fake what you feel and ignore what's real. Plastic people are the best.

Meaning is rather important to the equation. Without meaning, there is no reason."
