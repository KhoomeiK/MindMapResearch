mentalhealth,etvh59j,t1_etvb8dx,1563235274.0,"Now that is a different case. 

If he doesn't know how you feel about it then you should sit down and have a serious conversation with him; not in a ""you are in trouble"" kind of way, just serious but calm.

If he does know that's how you feel with these sort of things/behavior from his part, you can also do what I mentioned before. However, he should know that these kind of things affect you greatly and (if he will continue to do them) he should do them in a more subtle way.

Now the most important thing I can tell you is that no matter what, you are always first and NOT second best. One thing I can say from life experiences is that you are the most important ""being"" in your life, he should know and see this if he is with you. If he doesn't it's his loss and you shouldn't fell bad for it."
mentalhealth,etvaden,t1_etv8jbj,1563230266.0,"Also understandable. So, here's my view on the matter. You should both be free to have fictional movies in your heads about anything outside of your relationship. It actually becomes a healthier habit when you trust each other enough to talk/joke about these kinds of things. Of course this in healthy if there's no actual intention of doing it.
Take this case for example, having a baby with a celebrity. It's something one can say out loud, but not have the intention of actually doing so. My point is you and your relationship are real; what really matters. The other is fantasy. Hope nothing I said is taken in a wrong way."

When I was young I kept having the same dream where I was surrounded by a lot of dark sketchy buildings and the one I was on was mainly a huge cauldron of fluorescent green bubbly acid. The way it always went was: panic attack due to loneliness, and well the acid below me; jump to a sudden situation where someone very close to me (family member or friend) would be hanging on to a protruding pipe almost about to fall into the acid and me never succeeding in saving them. They always fell to the acid, causing real pain for me eventually leading to me waking up soaked in sweat. 

It happend so often that at one point I just knew it wasn't real and started doing random shit while still on the dream. Thinking back on it, I think this could've been the reason why now I have lucid dreams most of the time."
