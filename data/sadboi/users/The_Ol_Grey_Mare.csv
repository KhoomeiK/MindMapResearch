Yet jerma is my favourite entertainer on this planet and I have been so much happier these past few months having semi regular content from jack to enjoy. He is so good at making these highlights and I don’t see why you should ignore such talent when it can only result in more content being created and more people enjoying the big man jerma. Isn’t that what we all want?"

AskReddit,fbxq0uh,t3_eetf7i,1577197256.0,I used to get packed lunches at school with cheese sandwiches I didn’t like. But I was too anxious to tell my mum I didn’t like them so when I was in school at lunchtime I would just put them down the back of a filing cabinet. This must have gone on for weeks. Eventually I was standing near the filing cabinet talking to another kid when they caught sight of this treasure trove of cheese sandwiches and immediately told the teacher. So they lined the whole class up like a fuckin criminal line up and demanded to know who had done it. I owned up and the teacher said I had to take all the dusty ass old sandwiches home so my mum could see what I had done. When I got home I chucked them all over the hedge into the neighbours garden. Never heard about it again.
