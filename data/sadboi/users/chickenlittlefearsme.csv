The fact that you are so supportive of your daughter makes me unbelievably happy.  So thank you, I guess."

Hellenism,fmmx5y3,t3_fw8i3w,1586213780.0,"Hellenism is definitely LGBT+ friendly.  There are several gods who would change shape and gender frequently as well as several gods who had same-sex lovers.  On the more historical aspect, many citizens of Ancient Greece practiced homosexuality (as evident in graffiti).  In fact, gay sex was one of the primary reasons for the invention of olive oil (to be used as lube).  I'm certain that there wouldn't be as many people practicing homosexuality if the gods didn't support it.  Yes, most gods were married male to female, but that does not mean that there weren't many gods who took lovers of the same sex."

Hellenism,fldw5uf,t3_fo9gtw,1585072886.0,"Hi!

I'm a devotee of Poseidon, so hopefully I can help.

I definitely know where you're coming from.  I'm an active feminist, so when I felt a pull towards Poseidon I was cautious for the same reasons you were.  

You have to remember, though, that our gods are imperfect.  Unlike other monotheistic religions, hellenism accepts the fact that the gods are not perfect.  They are above us, yes, but they make mistakes.  While r\*pe should never be seen as a mistake and should never be condoned, you sometimes have to excuse the gods for what they've done.  

Their mistakes often keep them humble.  Our gods are prideful, but now and then need to be taken down a  peg.  So I suggest that you don't separate the myth from the god, but keep it in mind.  I don't suggest bringing it up in prayer, though.  That might get them a bit angry.

tl;dr: don't feel bad, and don't separate the two.  

good luck :)"

As soon as you've finished college move to that state and get away from them (if you still want to).  From what I've heard, your parents are emotionally abusive.  I've been there.

Many times the gods will call to us, but if you feel no strong pull to a god it is perfectly okay to start worshipping whichever god you like! As for your friend, I recommend she start doing things for Poseidon and see what happens.  Light a candle in his name and see what the candle does, for example.  It can often times tell you what's happening.  From there, maybe a small altar or a couple offerings and see how that goes! Good luck to you both :)"

\-The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue (bi and gay males): historical fiction and very funny 

\-it's sequel, The Ladies' Guide to Petticoats and Piracy (asexual female and a lesbian character)

\-The Song of Achilles (sexualities unsure but definitely queer): a retelling of the Iliad and my favorite book of all time

\-Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe (set in the 80s (I think) and is mlm)

\-Autoboyogaphy: mlm and very cheesy, but cute

\-the whole percy jackson/ heroes of olympus/ magnus chase series: lots of queer characters, and it gets more queer the further you read

\-I'll Give You the Sun: gay male and one of my favorite books!

\-Six of Crows: bi and gay male side characters but such an amazing duology!

Good luck with everything sweetie, and stay strong! I know how hard it is to be in the closet.  it gets better."
