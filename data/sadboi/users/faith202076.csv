SuicideBereavement,foetugc,t1_foee68d,1587714552.0,Sheâ€™s in therapy to. My x told her that her brother came home to our house got my gun and shot himself in his bedroom. It was extremely damaging telling her that. I had only told her he got hurt really bad and his heart stopped. My x is a evil person. Trying to help her through what her mom told her is very difficult

SuicideBereavement,fmbiyh1,t3_fu5hw9,1585927300.0,"I wish I knew to. After my son passed away in January I found some writing of his of how he didnâ€™t want to go to a hospital or back to counseling, he was scared of having to do that. So he hid it so well, I had no idea. The one time he was hospitalized in the mental heath unit for cutting made him chose death over having to go back. The doctor nor his counselor ever thought or said he was suicidal. He was 13. It is terrible him and others feel scared or ashamed of an illness that they would rather die. Mental health and suicide I hope someday will be comfortable for people to talk about without reservations."
