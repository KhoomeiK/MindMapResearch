just be yourself. being genuine is one of the most attractive qualities. that being said, you don’t need to figure out what pick up lines you’ll be throwing out there - girls have heard it all before and also, they are super cringy...

and don’t be afraid of rejection. it happens to EVERYONE. even those who are very experienced with relationships. don’t think of it as a loss. every failed relationship brings you one step closer to the right one."

It’s honestly just how you choose to look at things. We all wish we had someone else’s life, including yours. Be proud you’ve made it this far! Sometimes we forget how underprivileged some people can really be compared to our own living standards."
