SuicideWatch,f5zwdpk,t3_dj4nrp,1572591576.0,"I have a psychotic disorder along with a schizophrenic disorder. I had a 1.74 in a Mechanical Engineering major until it all hit. I lost my girlfriend of six years and saw her out tonight with her new boyfriend. I thought I was over her but it hit me like a fucking brick to the face. What’s the point in going on? Proving her wrong is bullshit and living out the rest of my life is bullshit. This isn’t the life I was in for and it isn’t a life I want to live. I almost did it tonight, for the first time, but I wasn’t man enough. Fuck it all"
