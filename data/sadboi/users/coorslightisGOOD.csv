I was diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety when I was 18, and still she doesn’t want to accept it. She will come up with anything to put my feelings on something else, often calling me out on my mistakes and all the things I do wrong. She has openly told me that when I tell her these things she feels attacked as a parent and feels the need to defend herself. I just wish she would try to understand. I have told her several times this isn’t her fault, and still. 

I don’t talk to anyone about how I fantasize about not being around anymore, I don’t want to scare people, and as much as people say “they understand” they usually don’t, and those people will be the first to pass judgement.
