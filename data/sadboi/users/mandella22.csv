BipolarReddit,fgurasb,t3_f0725r,1581127620.0,"THIS. I’m going through it right now and reading your post almost made me cry because sometimes I feel like no one understands. I feel so hopeless and become so dark and it’s scary. I’ve tried talking to my doc, I’ve had an IUD and nothing seems to ease it. I think it’s part of why I used to self-medicate. Now that I’m almost 6 months sober I’m having to deal with facing all of this hard shit I’ve been escaping for so long. I am am newly diagnosed and also coming to terms with what that means. I am so grateful to have a place to come to where I see my story in so many others. Thank you for sharing, it meant a lot to me."
BipolarReddit,ffzkfkf,t3_evxbg7,1580383497.0,Never posted on here before but I just wanted to congratulate you on staying sober. That’s a huge feat in itself and you should be very proud :) I have 5 months and am newly diagnosed as bipolar and am just crawling out of the worst depressive episode in as long as I can remember too. The best thing I held on to was trying to believe it wasn’t going to feel so bad forever. Hang in there. I am rooting for you!
