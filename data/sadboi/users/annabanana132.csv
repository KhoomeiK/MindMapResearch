AbruptChaos,fmco19v,t3_fu3v3t,1585949392.0,I raised a baby squirrel. His name was Kevin. I released him and he lived in my backyard for two weeks and then my cat ate him and put him on my porch... don’t recommend lol

BipolarReddit,fb4zsap,t3_eb4wox,1576518329.0,I’m glad I’m not the only one. I shower maybe 3-4 times a week and it’s really really hard. I hate it and I don’t understand why it is that way.

BipolarReddit,f9h4xqf,t1_f9gdz1m,1575309180.0,Thank you. I read Lamcital can cause it and I have noticed more memory issues since starting it but Lamictal have been my lifesaver so I guess you pick your poisons
BipolarReddit,f9h4oid,t3_e4ttx9,1575309082.0,"Thanks guys. This sub really helps. I have no support from family except from my grandmother, aunt and boyfriend so it’s really hard"
BipolarReddit,f9h4jy2,t1_f9glsft,1575309032.0,I have. I have felt really hypomanic lately and ended up ripping up my carpet on a whim so my whole house is in disarray. I’m sure it is somewhere but this is just draining.
BipolarReddit,f8n2ej4,t3_e16dzm,1574638232.0,I’ve missed my doses a few times and I’ve found it’s better to just wait until your next dose and try to level out instead of dosing too close. But that’s for me idk about you!
conspiracy,f7aegpc,t1_f6sd727,1573527224.0,I wish they would have elaborated more on that. How did they trick her each time and why on earth didn’t she sue?
YouShouldKnow,f6wfy3t,t3_dt61s4,1573225624.0,Can confirm. My grandpa is severely diabetic and I have had to do this a few times. Just give them a sugary drink or something sweet and they will begin to come to while you call for help. Nothing is worse than seeing your grandpas blood sugar crashing and someone won’t let you have a Coca Cola immediately. I’ll gladly pay for it but I need him okay first.
Art,f6nvdoa,t3_ds3xgh,1573000969.0,Great work! I have Bipolar II disorder and this is honestly a really good representation of mania and depression.
ChoosingBeggars,f6m3qba,t3_dra7ya,1572966150.0,Any update on comments? I’m dying to know lol
AskReddit,f4u1p4d,t3_dljuhb,1571796913.0,"We went to pick up my first date and as we were standing on the porch waiting for them to come to the door, my mom said, “watch this” and farted. Needless to say that relationship didn’t last."
AskReddit,f4de5mg,t3_dk3iw0,1571541398.0,"My friend and I ran away from home at 5 and 6. We got half a mile down the road near our local recreational department. My mom found us with a can of dog food, a bible and a jar of mayo. I have no idea why we did it either lol I was a tough child to raise"
BipolarReddit,f4d8jr2,t1_f4d8cei,1571539319.0,I know. I’m planning on picking them up at the pharmacy tomorrow. For some reason I always do this around winter/fall. I have a lot of manic episodes around this time too and I honestly feel mania coming on. I just mentally exhausted and I’m so tired of having to do this day in and day out
aww,f3faiqc,t3_dguepf,1570893568.0,"My dog Otis does the same thing! It doesn’t matter where he is sitting, he is going to slide off in a dramatic fashion. Lol"
BipolarReddit,f22q4g3,t3_dbhr8i,1569894309.0,"I do this with every job I have. I will put years into it but one day just snap. It scares me because I am doing really well. I graduated and got my first job in my field and it is great for where I am at in life right now. I just get worried I will get in a state again and start the process all over. 

I try my best to spend as much time outside as possible. Fresh air helps so much. I also try to keep to a schedule but always, always allow yourself breaks when you need them."
BipolarReddit,f1y9pua,t3_db4efd,1569812278.0,Congrats!!! This is an awesome accomplishment!!

AskReddit,evtqaqw,t3_cl7sij,1564775967.0,"I used to be a housekeeper in college. I went to a girls house one day and she literally had dog piss on the floor, trash everywhere, and the toilet bowl was black. You couldn't see the floor in her room due to the amount of clothes on it. I didn't clean that house."
AskReddit,etspe6o,t3_cd7irc,1563151825.0,It's pretty lonely but it has made me realise I have a genuine friend in my grandmother and I have recently started seeing her very frequently. I'm glad it was that way bc now I have so many memories with her. She lived in Maine for most of my younger life and now she is home and we are catching up on lost time.
unpopularopinion,etm9y7u,t3_ccdgfh,1562955266.0,I will agree with this until the day I die. I lost a fiance and a 5 year relationship bc of his porn addiction and it ruined me. He became a shell of the person I knew towards the end bc it had gotten so bad. Real men dont watch porn. Fight me.
unpopularopinion,etb6w3r,t3_cam5a9,1562638555.0,Can confirm. I got a Harry Potter quote (I don't mind that part) but I got the deathly Hallows on my ribs when I turned 18 lol big mistake

BeautyGuruChatter,esce015,t3_c6tkkn,1561827326.0,Does the image of her with the crown of brushes irritate anyone else? She just seems so entitled in it and I just wanna scream it's cheap morhpe brushes calm down
AskReddit,es7wb9e,t3_c668in,1561681646.0,Never getting any attention and being an extra parent. Always belittled
BipolarReddit,es6ud7u,t3_c672ei,1561657509.0,"I have animals. My pets get me through the toughest times and love me endlessly. I strongly encourage you to get a pet you can financially and responsibly care for. If you cant get a dog, get a cat. If not a cat, a hamster or a fish. Whatever you can care for the best and give all of your love to it and it will give you love back ten fold"
BipolarReddit,eruslyo,t1_eru8y4v,1561295929.0,Thankfully I've been so blessed with my SO. He has family who has BP2 which is what I have and he is amazingly supportive.
BipolarReddit,eru42jq,t3_c3y0gl,1561262392.0,"My pets help me stay on track in every aspect of life. I have several dogs, a cat and I am rehabbing a squirrel (I have a rehabber license and he will be released after rehab) but they give me purpose and a schedule that I have to follow.

AskReddit,eriahwz,t3_c23y2n,1560893047.0,Don't
BipolarReddit,erc36rm,t3_c18arn,1560701542.0,I had this issue too. It's so weird.
AskReddit,erazkqe,t3_c12h5u,1560656829.0,My dog Lucy sleeps with me at night. She let's me know she is ready to be tucked under the covers by scratching me with her paw. She also follows me everywhere.
BipolarReddit,er612tz,t1_er5uup3,1560537676.0,Just search for scholarships or Grant's in your state! I did it :) you can too!!
BipolarReddit,er5ua1i,t3_c0hf6i,1560533628.0,It took me 5 years to get my Associates Degree (2 year program) it was HARD. Some semesters I only took one class but I did it. Never give up!
BipolarReddit,eqqo5xi,t1_eqkw18u,1560226482.0,I've recently just started on it. I take 100 mg and we are working our way up in dosage if needed. It is insane at the difference I feel. I have BP2 and I didnt realize the difference in quality of life with a modd stabilizer
