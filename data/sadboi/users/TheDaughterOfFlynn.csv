I would look up some skincare hacks and workouts on Pinterest, tons of masks you don’t need to buy when u can make them! And you don’t need a gym, YouTube or Pinterest workouts work great for me!
I would take a lot of walks outside if/when you can. Spending time with nature helps me to stop thinking so much about the urban world and all the things I have to think about, if that makes sense.
Dedicate the evenings to yourself if u can. Make a playlist of songs that make u feel confident and sexy, have a bath or shower (try it with the lights off, surprisingly soothing!) read a book or do a relaxing hobby. Take your time with your skincare. Make it fun!! Also look up a lymph node facial massage and remember to be gentle, especially around your eyes. Use your ring fingers to pat in that area.

She pulled out 3 boxes, 2 water bottles, and a bag full of rocks, crystals, and gems she’d been collecting during her summer vacation. Some she’d bought in beachside stores, some she’d collected from the family river in Idaho. It took up most of her suitcase. She knew I loved rocks and crystals etc and missed the geology store I used to work at, so I am grateful for her every single day.

I hope I don’t come off as bragging at all, but I think personally the kindest thing I’ve ever done was helping save a life. This person I have on insta but don’t know personally changed their username to ‘killing_myself_today’ and went on live. I saw this and talked to her. I managed to get her reasoning and start talking to her about it. I messaged someone she mentioned was causing her to do this and I got him to call her an ambulance since he knew her irl. She told the ambulance he was lying so they went away but I kept talking to her and she’s still alive. She’s still in pain but over the months she seems to be doing a lot better, and I’m really proud of myself because that was the most stressful thing I think I’ve ever done"

I’m very sorry you have to experience this after raising her in a Christian manner. Although I don’t know her, it sounds like maybe she’s become an atheist because she believes in abortions and that conflicts with her Christianity. If that sounds anything like the situation at all, even if you’re pro-life maybe try to be open to the idea of pro-choice Christianity. That’s what I believe and I’ve always been Christian (my dad’s a pastor and he agrees in certain cases). If there’s a conflict between her beliefs, try to open her mind to the fact that some people believe you can have both, and work from there.
If this sounds nothing like your situation, sorry. Just let her know you love her, and don’t actively try to change her mind at all. That’s not your place. It’s God’s, and you doing it will only push her away. Good luck!!"
