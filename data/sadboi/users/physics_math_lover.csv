I’ve tried CBT for emotional instability. It helped me to some extent. Problem is that just like a band aid don’t fix a bullet hole, so doesn’t just stabilising my emotions do with healing my wounds. I exercise daily, eat healthy and regularly and have a regular sleep schedule. Moreover I hang out with friends often which I enjoy doing and I also do things that I like. But my mental wounds are still as fresh as they were 3 years ago. I still feel like my core self is made up of responses to traumatic events throughout my childhood and teenage years. Don’t know what to do."
femalefashionadvice,fpepk0r,t3_gcxrds,1588552213.0,Is it possible to have cool undertones in the face and warm undertones in the rest of the body or vice versa? Because my face has a different skin colour and is cooler than the rest of my body. I tan quite easily in the summer but it does take some effort. I rarely get sunburned. Not sure which colours fit me well so I just stick to lots of black. Is it possible to have light medium skin with neutral undertones and tan pretty easily?
GenderCritical,fou1op6,t3_g9gsjn,1588073612.0,"It’s like saying that humans generally speaking have 10 fingers and 10 toes. Then someone says “But not all humans have 10 fingers and 10 toes. Some are born with more or less fingers and toes. Some people have lost one or several toes or fingers in accidents.” It still doesn’t make the fact that the vast majority of humans have 10 fingers and 10 toes any less true. 

Yes, some women don’t have ovaries due to several reasons. But the vast majority of women do. Lack of ovaries in a woman doesn’t mean that she is any less of a woman."

CPTSD,fmkqwvl,t3_ftj5vv,1586165118.0,"I’m not sure if this is the correct place but quarantine constantly triggers me. When I lived with my bio family, it really felt like I was isolated from the rest of the world. I couldn’t control it and I had no idea when it would end. I felt so hopeless. 

It’s a similar thing now. I can’t control when this pandemic is over and I don’t know when it ends. I can’t see my friends in person. Moreover, I learned in therapy, the number one thing I shouldn’t do when I feel down is to isolate myself. I thought almost my entire life that I was introvert. Turns out, I’m an extrovert. Pretty much my normal daily life is social. I’m social in school. Then I do martial arts which is a social sport in the evenings. I love to see my friends and SO in the weekends. Some days, I can see three different friends in one day and I don’t find it exhausting at all. I’m comfortable with hanging out on my own but in the end, I need to see people. 

Some days it’s quite hard. It doesn’t help that my foster parents joke all the time about me being lazy. Like no, it’s perfectly okay to not be super productive during a pandemic. I try to exercise every other day and activate my brain every day. I mean, I do my best and that’s all I can do."

I know, it’s crazy that it’s a fetish. Do they also fetishise about having endometriosis and have intrusive tissues in their abdomen etc? Do they also fetishise about being in so much pain that they can’t walk and are written off by healthcare professionals as being merely hysterical and given anti-anxiety medications? Do they fetishise about walking around with so much pain that their life quality is considerably worsened and many of them never being diagnosed with endometriosis? Do they also fetishise about receiving poorer healthcare when it comes to acute illnesses like heart attack and strokes?

To deny that women have vaginas is sexist. Women have fought so hard to not being seen as their genitals. We have fought so hard to have our own spaces and our own divisions in sports. 

I’m so sick of these MtF trans people who claim that they are not trans due to shallow gender roles but then state the very reason why they are trans is because they like pink and to wear makeup. A man wearing makeup and a dress is still a man. A woman who wears a suit and Oxford shoes is still a woman. Your hobbies, clothing of choice do not determine your gender. Your chromosomes do. Ffs I enjoy doing martial arts. Does that make me any less of a woman. No it doesn’t! 

Also even if a trans woman had genital surgery, it does not look like a vagina and will never. He still has the bone structure of a man which makes it really fucking unfair for women who compete against trans women. Oh yeah and also men tend to be twice as stronger in their upper bodies compared to women on average. Even if trans women took medication to suppress their testosterone production, it wouldn’t be fair in sports to let them compete against women. 

I’m so damn sick of this trans ideology. I’m so sick that men who feel like women get to compete in women’s sports, get women’s scholarships etc. It’s downright misogynistic. I’ve lost a few friends and I broke up with my gf due to them thinking that some women have dicks.

Also one last thing, here in Sweden doctors let 14 year old girls to have surgery to remove their breasts because they feel like men. These poor girls often suffer from autism, eating disorders, anxiety, depression and suffered sexual abuse. To me letting a 14 year old girl doing this irreversible surgery is pure child abuse. In 50 years we will look back with horror on what we did to the most vulnerable people of the society. We will look back on this just like we look back on the horrific experiments in psychiatry in the 20th century today. The psychiatry must not let repeat its dark history. These poor girls need therapy and medications, maybe even being hospitalised if their mental health issues are really severe. Not letting them mutilating themselves because they hate themselves. 

This post is all over the place but yeah, it shares my peak trans stories."
GenderCritical,eok08n0,t1_eoi9iuj,1558645315.0,Yeah I cannot believe that she actually said that. Thank goodness I broke up with her.
GenderCritical,eok052h,t1_eogrn90,1558645276.0,I broke up with her. See my reply to the first comment why I did it.
GenderCritical,eok00x6,t1_eogpbqx,1558645230.0,"Thanks for the input. After talking to her for two hours today, I realised the best thing for me is to break up with her. And so I broke up. I don’t want to be together with someone who doesn’t give a shit about my safety. My gym mates who are almost all guys, think what she said is really stupid. I spend a lot of time with them, both at the gym and outside. To them, letting a man compete against a woman under the disguise of feeling like a woman in MMA, is very dangerous for the woman. It is really assault. I’m so glad that I broke up today. 

My ex refused to acknowledge basic biological facts and that showed that there is no point to be with her. I can’t change anyone else. But I can remove toxic influences from my life. 

Another thing is that she shamed me today for wanting to have four kids before I turn 35. I’ve a strong desire to become a mother. I’m 19 and I’m going to attend university and study mathematics for four years. Then I will get a job and save up money for having kids. But she said that’s stupid of me. Instead according to her I should live life to the fullest. And that I’ve been brainwashed by the society into thinking my life purpose is to have children. That was the final straw. I think as long as I can provide for my future children and support them emotionally and give them lots of love, I don’t see the problem with becoming a young mother. No one has the right to tell me how to live my life ffs."
GenderCritical,eogeqp5,t3_bqtvli,1558556459.0,"First of all, I’m very happy I found this place! 

I’ve an issue and would like to hear your thoughts. I’ve been together with my lesbian girlfriend for three months now. She is very serious about our relationship. She wants to go on vacation with me to her home country this summer. 

My issue is that she thinks that transgender women should compete in women’s sports. I myself exercise MMA and Thai boxing 5-6 times a week. I argued with her that it’s utterly insane to let a transgender woman compete with a woman in the cage or the ring. It would be outright dangerous for the woman. I do regularly sparring with my male gym friends but they are always careful to not use their full power, otherwise I could be seriously injured. Even if I and a man weighed the same, he would on average still be stronger than me. When I told her that I didn’t want to compete against transgender women because I don’t want to be seriously injured, she accused me of being transphobic. She said that transgender women are just as strong as women, not stronger. I don’t get her logic either or rather the lack of it. 

She is a lesbian who thinks that some “women” have dicks. I’m a bisexual woman and this is my first relationship with a woman. And I think that transgender women shouldn’t compete in women’s sports, especially in full contact sports like MMA. Furthermore she tries to tell me that I’m a lesbian in denial. I don’t have anything against heterosexual and bisexual men. 

What should I do? Should I try to tell her that I dislike that she tries to define my sexuality and that I dislike her views on that transgender women should compete in women’s sports? 

Sorry for being all over the place, English is my third language."
