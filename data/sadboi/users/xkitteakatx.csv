PurplePillDebate,fqbjjzm,t1_fqafqsc,1589238172.0,That is so cool. I read something about how a lot of the serotonin that your body makes is actually used in your digestive track. And if balls can have taste receptors there is no reason to believe that the lining of our gut or the cells of our guts may have more of an impact on our mental health than we believe. Thank you so much for the tip I will give it a shot once I get the opportunity to. :)
PurplePillDebate,fqadhz4,t1_fqa19y9,1589217217.0,"As someone who lives with anxiety let me tell you that as long as the sun is out I will choose the bus over driving anyday. Well any day where there isn't a pandemic sweeping the world. It is just so taxing and stressful for me to be out there. If someone gets to close to my car/ lane I panic, if I have to drive near a big rig/ 16 wheeler I panic, if I have to use the freeway I panic a little or a lot depending on the amount of cars on the freeway. If it is rush hour I can't drive because I am so afraid of getting into an accident that if I can avoid driving I will just not drive. The only thing that makes it easier is driving consistently. If I stop driving for any decent amount of time the panic attacks are worse and I have to start all over again. And I have to start small. Like frequent small trips during non peak traffic hours to the store and back, then make trips slightly longer and longer until I can build back up to driving at a normal ish amount. Once I get to that stage of driving again I am good I just have to make sure that I don't stop driving for any amount of time. And this is coming from a person who lives in a small city with decent transportation but not great transportation like san Francisco does. We only have buses here that are somewhat reliable. I would honestly move there if I could afford to. I visited once and the transportation was so incredibly good. It was fast, reliable, came by every 5 minutes rather than every 15-30 like where I live, and it was everywhere. If someone offered me a life in a big city with a decent job where I could live somewhat comfortably I would  give up on driving all together and never look back. I drive now because I have to. I am capable of driving consistently as I did so for about 6 months as an uber driver. I loved driving but the road rage out here is so bad that I can't drive during peak hours because people get extremely aggressive with their driving as well as their behavior. It's just too much to deal with without it taxing your mental health and energy even if you don't have anxiety."

AskReddit,fpumcb2,t1_fpuipiz,1588916802.0,I wouldn't label myself as fur curious because I find furry art to be arousing and I have been looking at it for many years. People wearing fur suits are not at all attractive to me. They seem like they could be fun but I could never be turned on by a fur suit. I like the idea of two creatures coming together despite their differences like human x invert mystical being here fall in love and fuck. Or two furries with human level mental and emotional intelligence fucking. If anything I would consider myself more of a pansexual for the idea of interspecies relationships be they romantic or sexual or both. Hmm the thing that I would like people to know would probably be that just because someone enjoys furry hentai or is an actual furry that doesn't mean that they want to fuck real animals. I find the idea of having sex with a real animal for real very disgusting.

I don't know if I should classify myself as a furry because real furries would not accept me as I don't have a fur suit or a fursona. I am not an other kin either as I don't believe that I am an animal trapped in a human body. I do however really enjoy reading hentai with furries in it. So the average person would consider me a furry for this reason but I wouldn't be accepted as a furry by people who are genuine furries. So I guess that I am a half furry?

They wouldn't waste their time on average women because average women are so unattractive compared to what a Chad is used to. It's like eating premium cuts of steak all the time or eating a roasted chicken breast. The breast is still meat and others might find it beautiful but you have tasted steak and the chicken just doesn't compare. Sure you'll eat if there is nothing else to eat it but you won't really enjoy it and would certainly pass it up if given the chance to eat a steak instead.

But I feel compelled to tell you that I am an above average attractive  woman and I have only ever had guys less attractive than me try to get with me. Never once has a Chad level man even looked my way. I have long dark wavy hair, long dark eyelashes, shapely lips that are neither too thin nor too thick, hazel green eyes, naturally blushed cheeks, natural D cups, and a natural bottom heavy hour glass shape with a large ass and thick thighs. I am 5'6 and have weighed 120lbs-145lbs most of my adult life. I'm not perfect I have a large nose but I am more attractive than the average woman and Chad's still won't look twice at me because they are used to perfect looking women throwing themselves at them. If I can't get a Chad don't you think that there is a fairly large untapped market for male prostitution? And a much higher percentage of women would fuck far more men if men actually took the time and effort to make a woman orgasm."
PurplePillDebate,fp8yf33,t1_fp76ldr,1588407425.0,"Women regret casual sex because they rarely cum from it and because in societies eyes a ""loose"" woman has less value than a woman that doesn't sleep around. So you take this risk in the hopes of having a great time at the risk of having people look at you like human garbage, catching an STD, or worse getting pregnant with some dude's that you just wanted to f+ck child. Which makes all of the above even worse. Women risk all this for an orgasm that they never get because 90+ percent of men will just use a woman to cum in rather than trying to stimulate her and make her come. So yeah women are more regretful but that number would be a hell of a lot smaller if women actually got to orgasm as often as their casual partners do."
PurplePillDebate,fp8xplu,t1_fp8209n,1588406683.0,"I call BS on that. When I was in my late teens and early 20s so many older men in their 40s & 50s kept trying to pick me up when I took the bus home from work thinking that I was a prostitute just because I don't match the ethnic demographic of my neighborhood. I would be wearing bluejeans and a tshirt with tennies. About 80% or more of the older people in my area were catholic, they married young, and had multiple kids. Older men who have wives that they can f*ck at home typically would prefer a young streetwalker over their overweight, wrinkled, middle aged wives. Just because you have a woman at home to f*ck doesn't mean that she is your first choice. And I would legit pay to f*ck a Chad level man because I would never land one organically. If there was a male version of the bunny ranch where I would be guaranteed a clean Chad level guy to f*ck I would. Going there would be life goals for me. I would plan a whole vacation around going to the Chad ranch."

The nurse has a very pretty face, is straight but has very high standards for a partner's maturity level and isn't particularly interested in romance or sex and saw one of her friends throughout high school sleeping around with a bunch of guys and it was a real wake up call to what she didn't want. All three of these girls were high school friends. The accountant is very skinny, plain but not ugly, and a huge romantic. She also has high standards of men. Except what she wants doesn't exist. She wants a gorgeous skinny guy who will pick her up bridal style, carry her on his back, and treat her like a princess. She refuses to accept anything less. And because of this she never has. Neither of these women have ever been with a guy and they don't seem any different then any other women their age.
