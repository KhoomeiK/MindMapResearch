depression,fcmphqw,t3_ehy5mu,1577785777.0,"I have the same thing. Living with my parents while they are the reason i’m depressed and suffering from ptsd. I used to live on my own but had to move back.. 
Your plan is great! Keep that motivation and you will get there. And till then just keep thinking that this home situation is not gonna be forever. I believe in you !!"

depression,fcac7fk,t1_fc9pzfe,1577566581.0,"Sorry i was so tired i fell asleep. i totally get it. Right now because of Christmas I put on a fake mask and i always feel nothing but numbness then. It will take a few days to loose it and then the sadness will return bit by bit. its so annoying. What do you do to distract yourself from the sadness? 

I had pizza. Pizza is life :)"
depression,fc9pjx4,t1_fc9nglv,1577556244.0,"I know right?! It feels like being with a “normie” ends up hurting them or you end up being hurt by a abusive person. And then you have the third shit option : being alone. 

And no problem haha im gonna have diner now"
depression,fc9j9da,t1_fc9gjx4,1577553478.0,"Indeed she should have been honest. She clearly didn’t deserve someone as nice as you are. 

I feel guilty all the time and i’m the kind of person who always seeks the problem by myself. But its true its so much easier being with a “normal” person.. But some people just don’t to let go and refuse to face they do you wrong instead of loving you. 

Life really suckss ugh."
depression,fc9fljg,t1_fc9ddq2,1577551954.0,"Noo that doesn’t sound weird to me, you’ll take pleasure with what you are used to. Till you reach that limit, yours just really high cause you took it for months. Its all worth the fight, you deserve better. 

To be honest it was the best it could be (i think)
I was/am really in love with him and he treated me really good. He is the first person who did that for me and the only person i feel comfortable enough with to let my guard down. Since a year he just turned colder and i know he still loves me but he just can’t handle my ptsd and depression. I had a really bad childhood and i just pushed everything away till i couldn’t anymore. I lost my job because i couldn’t work anymore and needed to get therapy and i kinda lost myself.  
In the beginning he really tried being there and comforting me. Now he still listens but there is no warmth and relationship kinda stuff ( like kissing etc.) and he feels like he can’t give me what i need. 

I’m torn because i love him so much and we used to be so good together. I just makes me really really sad. 
( i hope i make some sense i wrote this in pure emotion :p )"
depression,fc9cujm,t1_fc9aww9,1577550674.0,"It always takes some time to accept the hurt that was done to you. Im also always too nice so i must say im really impressed you did it!! You should be sweet for yourself you are fighting and moving forward. 

No problem, it really helps me talking with someone so thank you too :)"
depression,fc9a3ie,t1_fc9955w,1577549490.0,"I’m sorry you have to go through all these setbacks, but you are doing a good job even if it doesn’t feel like that right now. Leaving a bad abusive relationship is really hard! And you did it! 

And fuck our parents. Fuck everyone! We deserve so much more."
depression,fc989v1,t1_fc97ed8,1577548615.0,"Ughh i understand. Its like you are me lol. same thing here, im so tired of it all. Because of their mistakes i’m messed up trying cleaning up the shit they made. 
I have no clue wtf i’m doing but i’m trying to find my own me. 
Its hard to stay positieve tho"
depression,fc97ngl,t1_fc96uxb,1577548330.0,Same here. I really hope you don’t give up tho! All the people here deserve to find themself and be happy not letting their past and family/friend drag them down. You are important !!
depression,fc96tii,t1_fc9540s,1577547947.0,"Such a shitty thing to say. You should be able to talk about the stuff you are going through and if thats with him he shouldn’t point fingers to your mom.. 
my dad is just like that sigh."
depression,fc96ar5,t1_fc951fw,1577547714.0,Im so sorry that you also have/had to go through that. And thankyou for your comment it reminds me that i’m not alone x
depression,fc9253q,t1_fc91rju,1577545807.0,It also made me mad! but he just doesn’t understand my depression at all. i also suffer from ptsd so its hard to be “normal” for me now. he feels like he can’t help me.

But.. today after days of laying in bed i made freaking creme brulee ( i know super random) all by myself for the first time!
I’m really proud of myself."
depression,ez19ul0,t3_czth7a,1567646283.0,"Everywhere you go there will always be fake people. I like to think that they are dealing with their own demons. I’m not gonna tell you to stay but there are many good and nice people here who aren’t fake. 
Either way i wish you well and i hope you’ll find peace for yourself."

I got so used putting all my emotions away that now i just don’t know how to deal with them so instead of crying i just feel incredible sad,hollow and numb. I wish i knew how to deal with that."
depression,ewugjz3,t3_cq6axq,1565780227.0,I miss love too.. i miss the feeling of coming home.
depression,ewug9uu,t1_ewtptc6,1565779902.0,"Goodluck sis, you got this! Yes it feels like everything is falling apart and yes its so freaking hard dealing with all those things. But you ARE strong and you are going to beat this freaking depression with time and patient en love that you need to give yourself. You are worth it.  xx

depression,esx01ha,t1_esv9o7c,1562323399.0,I have this all the time. When i talk to much i just see how people don’t care and don’t listen anymore. I feel like im stupid shithead for talking and then i get quiet for days.
depression,es8xy31,t3_c6f9c2,1561720345.0,"I feel the same way.. its my birthday tomorrow then i’ll turn 24. It sucks to pretend that everything is okay.
