it's easy to excuse it and say it's the last time, it's tempting to just shove it down and pretend it's all in your past. it takes a lot of courage to say ""yeah, this will happen again."" with an ED you fight the battle every day, every meal, every hour.

ignore me if you're not in therapy anymore, but my suggestion when someone os struggling with something therapy related is almost always to talk about it with your therapist. they're there to help you, and if it's not helping, then there's always something else to try.

every therapist is different, and there are many kinds of therapies out there. talk therapy doesn't work for everyone, and that's OK if that's what your case ends up being, but that doesn't mean you have to give up."

most people recover. we don't have perfect numbers since so many cases are asymptotic or mild and as a result aren't reported. if you're in good health, you have very little to worry about re: yourself - just have to be very careful not to infect others, especially those are risk.
