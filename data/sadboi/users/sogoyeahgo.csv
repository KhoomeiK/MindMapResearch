BPDlovedones,flnaz73,t3_fpqpci,1585314331.0,"I have trauma from this so in a way I can relate. For example the level to which I hate this person is i think a function of trauma. For example I want to understand that this is just a disorder so that I am not so angry. 

Using the analogy of the villagers sending messages it's like one of the villagers knows and understands that this isn't a bad person but a disordered person. If I could get that message to my brain it would help me but I can't. I can intellectually understand but my trauma acts as if I don't have that understanding

That would be a case of my trauma inhibiting my schemas from communicating. 

I think I'm only going to have a more unified understanding when my trauma dies down and it probably is the result of my brain using that predictive feature. My brain just wants me to stay away. I've always thought trauma clouds thinking but this helps see what's happening."

BPDlovedones,flmzt2j,t3_fpqpci,1585303602.0,"I have also been thinking about the concept of splitting lately and what it is

I just feel like I had been thinking about splitting incorrectly. That maybe it's not a mental construct or even about thinking or thoughts. It's really just their emotions and their emotions create their thoughts.

Basically they feel bad and so we must be bad and we must be causing it.

Splitting white is also just plain emotion. The fact that they idealize is just a quality of a certain type of high pitched love that we all experience when we are 16. It's just that this is the way it always feels to them because their emotions are extreme.

Maybe we think of splitting wrong. They aren't opposite things. It's the continued pattern of extreme emotion and fact equals feelings thinking

Also when they feel negative emotion it's not just negative emotion they are experiencing it's also childhood trauma. In time they come to attribute the childhood trauma they feel to the people around them."

The person I quoted also said that both disorders view others as supply.. it's just that in the case of pwBPD they want that supply in the form of a caregiver

I do agree that narcissists can be needy too though. I have a npd family member and your comment made me stop and reflect on some things you mentioned"

BPDlovedones,flhfnob,t3_foslhq,1585161751.0,"They're incredibly similar. The way I view it is that both have defective defense mechanisms to protect themselves. With npd it protects their Ego and in the case of BPD it protects them against shame

Both distort reality to protect their ego and self. In both cases you can't argue facts. In both cases everything is your fault. In both cases they use others to validate their views even if they mean they need to lie. 

In all the official materials fear of abandonment is thought to be central to BPD but I don't see it that way. 

Plenty of people don't want to be abandoned but that's not what makes it bpd. PwBPD want a caregiver but so do plenty of people. It's the fact that you can't use reason with them because their defense mechanism won't allow it and that's the difference between normal people and those with a cluster B disorder"
BPDlovedones,fldi53a,t1_fl8l1kp,1585065000.0,Have you heard of the concept called mentalization? Apparently pwBPD struggle to understand both others and themselves. It's such an ordinary ability that it's impossible for us to understand why pwBPD have difficulty with it. We think because they are human they must have this ability somewhere in them and this is probably what's at the crux of our difficulties with them.
BPD,fldcwkm,t1_fkse8mn,1585061914.0,"Thanks for the response. I do understand my own experiences but I still am amazed that stupid stuff can cause trauma. I've analyzed it and I think that it's something for which the sum is larger than the parts. I think it's more largely experienced as something like an attack on concepts to do with the self which for whatever reason humans are vulnerable to. Also like you mention it could be a function of the level of stress that is experienced.

Still I think it's bizarre that I can't get over this and I think most anyone I would explain it to would also almost not even believe the severity of the symptoms I suffer relative to the abuse I experienced. 

I hope you are right that there is growing research and understanding about trauma from emotional abuse or c-ptsd as they call it which I'm not even sure is the right label for it and since it's not yet in the dsm I'm not sure the establishment is either. It makes me angry currently that there isn't more of an understanding. That I had to find all this information out through remote channels"

BPDlovedones,fl8h4ft,t3_fn9pbe,1584923552.0,"When it comes to their accountability what I have come to understand is that their disorder is a defense mechanism. They don't accept responsibility because they can't percieve it. 

I have trouble accepting this though. I still think they should understand even though I rationally understand why they can't 

The question I want answered is why can't I just accept it. I have a rational mind. I should be able to understand that they can't understand. The fact that I'm still upset about them not understanding is irrational and yet I feel it. It's so frustrating. 

I guess if I can be irrational I should be able to understand how they can be irrational.

I've thought about this stuff too much and sometimes on marijuana but I theorize that trauma (I have trauma from this) is what makes my mind want them to understand. Trauma flaws thinking. My wanting them to understand is a trauma response. My rational mind knows I can't expect that but my trauma mind wants to never give up

BPD,fkr2k3x,t3_fjs14r,1584460593.0,"I'm a neurotypical who experiences trauma as a result of dealing with someone with BPD. 

I believe that this trauma is the result of emotional/psychological abuse and that this is also the cause of BPD.  The only difference is that in people with BPD this trauma occurred before their brains were fully formed.

I think once a NT person becomes sort of traumatized then there is a breakdown in their abilities to be understanding. If you look at a graph of others level of understanding I'm sure most people's falls off rather then deepening as time goes on. 

What I've come to understand more then anything is that emotional/psychological abuse is something humans are not very well equipped to deal with.

In order to rationally understand and be supportive I feel like loved ones would need to be instructed before they start feeling traumatized. If I had known what I know now then I think I would have been less likely to get trauma from it

And trauma is crazy. I went from being a person who was supportive to being a person who wants this person dead. At that point it's not rational it's trauma

I think we need more understanding of the power of emotional abuse in general. 
Even subtle forms of it can be really harmful

I think I can get my mind around the fact that it's not that people with BPD are that awful it's just that it's the effect of emotional abuse is

I think those with BPD though could be more understanding about how sensitive people are to emotional/psychological abuse (and this can even be subtle and barely anything). So if you want us to be able to dig into our ability to understand and be supportive please understand that human vulnerability to emotional abuse makes people not be able to care/understand/give you what you need

And I'm not even a person who wants to feel this way toward people with BPD. I want to be understanding and compassionate but trauma has filled me with hate"
BPD,fkqwbvv,t1_fkp90y9,1584456953.0,"I deal with c-ptsd due to emotional/psychological abuse by with a person diagnosed with BPD. 

I have theororized that if this had happened to me in childhood while my brain was still developing then I would have developed BPD. 

An odd thing about this type of trauma is that it's reported to go away after a few years. This is unlike typical trauma that is life long and chronic. 

I feel like in a way I got trauma over nothing much. Having my reality denied. Verbal abuse. Just all the usual stuff but still the effects on my mental health have been really bad. It's serious trauma from really stupid stuff.

I guess my point is just that I think bpd exists as a result of emotional/psychological abuse before the brain was developed. I think the trauma that can happen to loved ones is very similar to what happened to people with BPD in childhood. I think the trauma I have is like pre-bpd expect that after the brain is developed instead of going into BPD in time this trauma goes away.

It seems like the trauma that can result from emotional/psychological abuse is very much understudied and appreciated."
BPDlovedones,fkgi96o,t1_fkgezbl,1584160583.0,"I second those resource links. 
When I first read about emotional/psychological abuse it was a big moment. That information perfectly covers what it's like.

Edit: just wanted to say thank you for posting that first link. It's really incredible

FYI the wiki link on bpd contains some pro-bpd  propaganda. It says they rarely harm others and have a no tolerance attitude toward anger

>one of the key differences between BPD and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is that people with BPD tend to internalize anger by hurting themselves, while people with ASPD tend to externalize it by hurting others.[174]

>In addition, adults with BPD have often experienced abuse in childhood, so many people with BPD adopt a ""no-tolerance"" policy toward expressions of anger of any kind


Disagree"
BPDlovedones,fkgh9o0,t3_ficbng,1584159695.0,"I've been thinking a lot about how subtle a lot of the abuse is. I think because loved ones can end up with trauma it would seem the abuse must be extreme but sometimes it's just a bunch of maddening stuff that drives you painfully insane
 
-Twisting reality and narratives in their favor. 
-Not being able to ever listen to you or hear   you when you try to communicate your feelings.
-minimizing, deflecting and overall
difficulty taking responsibility for actions

-a love of getting their perspective validated 
which includes talking badly about you to others
-keeping abusive private and maintaining an outwardly positive image 

I think a lot of people end up with a type of trauma that's from having your reality invalidated and having your identity corroded.

I would recommend reading about emotional/psychological abuse. That's basically what it is"
