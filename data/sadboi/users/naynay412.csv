SuicideWatch,fjmepgy,t3_f9d5go,1583468568.0,This is crazy because I am really going threw slot right now. I got a notification about the gannon updates and started seeing what this site was all about. I am glad to see I'm not the only one feeling messed up inside. I would love to explain my story but it would be a novel.
SuicideWatch,fjme9zt,t3_f9d5go,1583468242.0,ABSOLUTELY. I AM ACTUALLY GOING THREW THIS RIGHT NOW.

UnresolvedMysteries,fex3odd,t3_eq6wmv,1579423765.0,"I just was reading the comments from the first post and wanted to say that if the FBI considered them she would have been found a long time ago. WOW so many people were saying that she might be at the bottom of a lake, and 6 YEARS later it just so happened that they were right. God bless the family and hope they finally can rest since they got closer. üò¢"
