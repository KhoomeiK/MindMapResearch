If you refused, they will label you for being racist and xenophobic.

You will get death threats if you are woman and for some reason you're lucky to get a selfie with them and you posted it on twitter with kinda flirty caption. 

Your carrer will pretty much be damaged if you tried to state your honest opinion of why you don't like bts on your main account.

It's really funny if you claimed that the surface/popular rappers represent the majority. While in reality there are dozens or hundred of talented lyrical rappers because they never really get enough recognition. Or maybe they will, but some years later. 

If you think that majority of rap are trash. Well that way I can say the same thing about pretty much any genre being trash for over a decade because we never really had any era filled with the majority of good rappers or good musicians in the first place.

Even in the 2012-2013 the era of Yeezus, Acid Rap, Because The Internet, Channel Orange and Maad City. The only popular ones that charting on billboard or being frequently played on the radio are the likes of pop Eminem, Macklemore, Lil Wayne, Flo Rida, Pitbull, Nicki and such.

After that, I went to public high school and then public college. I think I've been agnostic ever since I was in middle school but only find out about agnosticism just recently. 

I don't know, there are so much contradiction in my minds about how I views the god and how my religion views the god. I think religion is just another set of rules that are given ever since we were a kid and to follow them blindly. It's a good thing I wasn't born in an Islamic country though and my parents are not really forcing me to practice the religion. So, I'm pretty much grateful for that. 

For me nothing's is really good or to be proud of about being agnostic. I feel like I already know too much and just feeling numb / my mind is automatically blocked whenever someone talk to me about bullshit religion, pretty much any religion. I used to be cherish and hopeful person when I was a believer though but I just can't go back to that time anymore. 

I'm still agnostic though but it feels like I'm alone in this world. I have nobody to share about my opinons about agnosticism while living and surrounded by religious people."

I don't have vision, skill, talents or something that motivates me to wake up tommorow. I feel like I might be dead before reach 30 even though I'm still 21. I'm still in college though doing my thesis even though I fucking hate reading and writing journal. 

I don't know anymore, I don't believe in religion. I don't have any friends. I love being alone. Being alone is fun. Nobody can tell you what to do. Never get to meet fake and toxic people. People never see my weakness. I have so many weakness, to the point it's keeping me to go outside or go in relationship or make friends. 

Internet is the only thing that keeping me alive. My life is full of anxiety, pessimistic, laziness, and negativity. I despise motivation speech and quote since they're full of shit. I despise my life for being a shit but I don't even have the will to change it.

Good thing, that I'm not suicidal. I think suicide is fucking wack. I'm not a religious person, but I believe there will be only darkness after you died. I don't believe in bullshit thing like heaven or hell. Maybe because I'm spending too much time on the Internet that I become numb with real life.

First, their fans have superiority complex, always put down other groups, and thinking that BTS are the only kpop group that deserved all the praise because ""tHeY strUgglEd sO mUch tHesE pasT seVeraL yEars"" and how everyone need to listen to them and obligated to be their fans. Like you.

Personally if you are true hiphophead you will find BTS discography to be the most generic, boring and forgettable. Nothing revolutionary about them and they only copying what's trending right now. They're like the Chainsmokers of hip hop, and wannabe of Kanye and Eminem. They have no authenticity in their discography either, except being cute korean and can dance.

I swear everytime I say that, their fans will always attack me with ""Oh you should listen to this BTS song called ...."" or ""BTS has so many genres"" or ""Their songs have dEeP meaning"" or ""You don't understand their struggle"" or bragging how many awards BTS had. SMH.

It's also funny that you questioning others that find Blackpink and such are likeable. Haven't you ever heard the phrase ""Music is subjective"" or ""Everyone has their own taste"" ?

I mean the guy you quoted just saying he also likes another Kpop group but there you are writing long-ass paragraph of why Blackpink sucks and why you should not listen to them. LOL. Jesus, don't be a fucking a freak and let people enjoy what they want. 

Seriously, the world doesn't revolve around BTS. Snap out of it. Don't freak tf out if someone don't like their songs.

You think he and his brother gonna let this company fall for someone else? no fucking way. I mean let's be real here, would you also be willing to give away your 23 years of hardworks to someone else?  Especially to give it to an outsider/someone new who literally have no experience to be there. It's just gonna cause more chaos.

It's a private company dude not a government lol. So, it's only natural that they pick someone who's been there for a long time, and it is a woman. Company is all about profit and image. 

These insistent scandals that YGE been getting, is already one big slap for them. Especially when YG brothers resigned, that is their peak of ""can't take it anymore""

Their profit has been drowning drastically and their image has been torn. Their company is being watched by everyone literally everyone (journalist, media, police, prosecutors, netizen, everyone). 

So yeah, there will be ""a change"" but gradually. They definitely will be playing safe after this and might listen to people and start giving people what they want. Probably."

This type of stuff can be very depressing because the idols felt the high pressure to be competitive, dealing criticism and shit like that. So, It's not surprised that a lot of idols come up to say talk about their mental health. It is depressing, intense and makes them think of suicide.

Remember 4minute, Sistar, Kara, WonderGirls, etc they all disbanded as well and all of them also have their own problem with management as well. But hey, YGE is always the most evil one there. We all know, Kpop industry is always been like that, harsh, cruel, full of criticism, depressing and competitive. 

Let's say that YG is serious to promote CL and Minzy, it just wouldn't go as smooth as they all wanted. Their popularity is dying, the only thing they have left is their loyal fans. Let alone promoting, YGE's most prominent producer is only Teddy and he is also busy with producing many other groups at his hand like Ikon, Winner, Big Bang, Blackpink.

While it is true that the majority of hip hop songs are about those things but at least they are living their live freely and could express whatever the hell they want without being criticized or shutdown by the media. 

I feel like mumble raps, autotuned is what makes hip hop is so special. Why? because it means hip hop is expanding their genre. Hip hop industry is far more creative than Kpop since there are a lot of genre of hip hop and rap. Every hip hop artist/rappers have their own distinctive style, so that's why somehow you can't compare Kendrick/Eminem/Gambino because they are good on their own style. It's like comparing apple and orange.

There are a lot of hip-hop or rap artits out there that are actually have a good quality and strong criticism on their lyrics. Like Kendrick, Gambino, J. Cole, Kanye, Tyler, Nas, MF Doom, etc. 

Now let's talk about Kpop. I've been a fan of Kpop since Big Bang put out Lies and Haru-Haru, I can say Kpop is static. They haven't changed a bit. It's always been about love, life, depression or any other pointless shit. They only sell ""the looks"",  ""cool dance moves"" and some ""generic pop"" type of song. It's boring, the market is also saturated. Their songs are almost no different. Like they don't even have their own distinctive style to what make them actually good besides of their looks.

You can always compare BTS with EXO, Got7 etc, or you can also compare BLACKPINK with Twice, RV, etc. Why? because they are so similar, almost identical. Unlike hip hop industry, where everyone has their own distinctive style of music.

Literally almost the whole Kpop industry is filled with so many boybands and girlbands. Some of them couldn't made it big and ended up disbanded. It's so depressing because it's not easy to be a kpop idols. You literally have to go through some cruel, harsh, intense and overwhelming training just so you can debut. After that, be ready for cruel criticism coming for whatever mistake you made. If you fail, you will get criticized, If you succeed, get ready for the bigger backlash, once you make one simple mistake.

Is YG guilty? I don't know, let's see how the court goes. 

Is YGE the only shady idols company in Korea? that's a good question, what do you think?

Are the idols who do drugs and involved in sex scandal ""only limited"" to YGE? that also a good question.

Rosie's solo and BLACKPINK comeback might have to wait until next year. 

Big Bang? well I feel like they're pretty much over at this point, their image will forever be stained and they might be focusing as soloist. iKon and Winner might either go flop or turn into another forgettable boyband. Treasure13? I don't really know, their debut might have to be delayed a little longer.

I'm just praying that whoever in charge of YG in the future, would not turn BLACKPINK into another generic girl groups with forgettable discography or turn them into cringe, pretentious and failed ""bad girl"". Because I found most of other girlbands are failed to bring out this concept. Only BLACKPINK could pull that strong ""bad girl"" image off without being cringy.

Also, reason why I still stan BLACKPINK up till now is that they haven't made any single bad song. They always put quality over quantity. So, I'm really afraid that they will end up making an album full of generic songs or maybe accepting every collaboration without minding the quality of the songs"

They're big? yes, They're break records? yes, They won many awards? yes, They're hardwoking guys? Yes, but so does everyone in Kpop industry. So does that automatically make their discography actually good? Absolutely no.

kpop,eqtrvd2,t1_eqt7c3l,1560318100.0,I heard tommorow they're gonna hold back Somi's Birthday and replace it with BLACKPINK full studio album instead along with 1 MV and 1 Solo MV. Crazy.
kpop,eqtrk4u,t3_bzl0ze,1560317886.0,"At this point, BLACKPINK is their one and only savior alongside with Teddy and mommy Bekuh.  BLACKPINK is without question will definitely not get involved, they're just good girls chasing their dreams but Teddy though. I swear once they get Teddy everything will definitely be crumbling down. That's the end of YG. The guy is mastermind of BLACKPINK and technically bigger than YHS himself."
kpop,eqi2mjk,t3_bpou7x,1560077345.0,"Yea I might be late, but bruh I'm not feeling it on this one, it sounds like every generic ballad songs you heard on every K-Drama ending. It feels like a filler tracks rather than a lead single. At first 1 minute it was going great, but then Haeri started to sing in high pitch  which kinda ruin the flows. So it makes the song feels so forced and I think it's kinda too early to sing it like that. This song is also lacking these distinctive and catchy hooks. 

Still a great song though for Davichi, but really not as great as they used to around 5-7 years ago. Those are the golden age of Davichi, more like they saved the entire Kpop industry just with their discography at that time."

Like helping them breaking records and shit, ahahaha what a laughable shit. boy, if your songs are great everyone would love that shit, no need for boosting their artificial popularity. Stop trying to make their songs look great, they're not. In fact, their songs are average and generic as hell. These who are stan, are seriously in need for help. They're lost, nothing's good stanning someone who don't even know who you are."
popheads,eq1q1jj,t3_bv0x1d,1559716022.0,"Ah yess Ariana and Cancelled concerts. Name a better duo than this. First, in 2015, Fairfax, Houston and Cincinnati (USA) and UAE, Japan, Brazil and UK. Second, in 2018, well can't really blame her for having post-event trauma, but she did cancel again after her comeback (Mexico, Swiss, and Vietnam). Third, in 2019, cancelled two shows in Omaha and Raleigh because she rather choose to headline Coachella. Then, this shit again, two cancelled shows in Florida.

Like seriously, get your shit together Ariana. Be professional for fuck sake. You been doing this too much. I feel like she holds the biggest number of cancelled concerts ever. I bet she doesn't understand how that felt of being a fan who have to go through some complicated shit just to see her but in the end, find out that the concert has been cancelled in the last 5 hours. AND ANNOUNCED THAT SHIT SO UNPROFESSIONAL, IN A FUCKING STORY, WITH SOME LAZY ASS STATEMENT. Like bitch, they are suffering to get there just for you and you announced that shit simple as that, in a fucking story that will disappear in 24 hours.

I don't understand how the fuck she keep getting away with this. And no, I'm not fucking tolerating this shit, she is been doing this shit too much, BE PROFESSIONAL FOR FUCK SAKE."

popheads,epm6s4l,t3_bv2l2m,1559308880.0,"Bruh this is like the every type of song I heard in 2017-2018. The beginning part sounds like songs that you've heard in SyverbalVibes (lyrics channel), the beats and the drops are just too bland for me. The fast rap parts seems too forced to the point is kinda annoying since it seems racing with the beat. I feel like her distinct ""Katy Perry"" vibe has gone long time ago, she sounds like these new female indie artists you've heard on Radio or Youtube these past couple years."

If you really wanna know what's their normal lifestyle would've actually like if they were all free, you can pretty much look up to every western artists. No different than any normal human beings.

They can post their opinions, flexing/showing off, posting their daily lifestyle, take pictures with their friends, post what music they listen to, promoting each other even though from different labels, and etc."
unpopularopinion,eor9a18,t3_bnp5m4,1558802975.0,"I don't know if I'm the only one ""woke"" or people are just too stupid to realize you spent money to make the artists get RICHER through easy way. I mean you literally paying artist to play you a song that you can always listen in your gadget. 

Most of the time the quality of the music are just the worst, the crowds are damn loud, you can't even see the artists clearly, the atmospheres are also so bad. 

I know that there are a lot of ""artists"" who always give 100% on their concerts or serving some god-tier music quality, visual and experience e.g Twenty One Pilots, Chemical Brothers, Gesaffelstein etc. Those guys concerts are definitely worth to attend for. Although, if we are talking in GENERAL, most of the concerts are just boring as hell but people still pay for that, no matter how expensive that is.

I still don't like concerts though, because like I said it gives the musician the easy way out to get richer without having ""real talents"" and get away with it by doing shitty performance most of the time.

Look, there are people out there who works their ass off to get a dollar or just enough to pay their bills or people who studied so hard for years and get the degrees they want but they don't even get the salary they deserve. Call me ""envy"" or anything but I'm just gonna say ""FUCK CONCERTS"" 

You literally donating money so that someone you idolize would get RICHER while you work your ass off just so you can pay your bills in time. Fuck That shit. I'm glad I'm not stupid enough to fall for that trap."

Self-love theme is cringy, naive and cheesy. It's like saying ""Hey don't be sad, just be happy"" or ""We all should love ourselves because it is positive for us"". Maybe yeah their concepts still works for teenagers, but for the grown-up this is the most silliest thing ever. Like what the hell do they know about the real world."

When I first heard BTS, their songs are just ""mediocre"" they sound just like every other cute/good-looking boys. I can't even tell their songs with these modern boy groups like EXO, Got7, Ikon or any other. 

Nothing special about their music really. Their success is just because they're like Columbus, the first one that took first step and actually focus in America."
