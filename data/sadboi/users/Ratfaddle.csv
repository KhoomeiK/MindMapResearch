CoronavirusCA,fogm0d0,t1_fogd9jh,1587754305.0,"I’m not sure why people on reddit have this assumption that nobody understands the situation like they do. It’s not like you are one of the few elite intellectuals that truly gets it. People are aware of the severity. Most are aware that things will not go back to normal in the immediate future. But acting like the world is over as we know it and condescendingly proclaiming that nobody gets it doesn’t help anyone. You don’t know anything. Nobody *knows* anything. Take things day by day, it’s all we can do."

Anxiety,fkrz8m0,t3_fkayil,1584478994.0,"100% me right now. First thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing I think about before I fall asleep. Exhausting. Just know that it’s not supposed to be the first symptom that you feel, breathing issues are supposed to come further down the line (if that helps). Stay up everyone we’ll get through this ❤️"
