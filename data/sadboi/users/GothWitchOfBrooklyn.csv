 Is it correct to call themselves scottish/German/Irish, whatever? No, that's why terms like Irish-American exist.

My family immigrated from Italy (grandparents born in Sicily). My parents were raised to integrate and assimilate so didn't keep up with the language though a lot of my extended family did. I have many cousins, aunt's, uncle's etc born in America but go to Italy 6months a year and speak fluent Italian. They would never be called out for not being Italian but they were born here just like me and we share traditions. We are Italian - americans. 

Lots of us over here have a bit of an identity crisis because there are just soo many regions of the us which have their own traditions, dialectal differences, as well as within those regions ethnic or ancestral differences.. there is not really one true 'american culture'. General pop culture is quite American yes but it's also globalized.
