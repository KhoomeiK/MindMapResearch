relationship_advice,fr32vgo,t3_gm7ux4,1589848838.0,I had this same problem with my FIL after the death of one of my daughters. He posted a picture of my daughter dead in my arms the day she died. He then blocked me and posted that she died and the “other” baby was okay. It just seemed callous and deceptive. We cut them out of our lives and we aren’t going to let our daughter meet them until she’s older. It wasn’t just because of this incident that we decided but a lot of problems with them since my wife and I got together.

My dog will come up to me when I’m upset and lay her head on my hand. If I don’t respond she will shove my hand until I pet her. It’s comforting when your pet shows that kind of affection when you’re hurting."
relationship_advice,fqw69oq,t3_gl6h5x,1589694060.0,Was he feeling rushed? Is there a reason he didn’t have time to save up for a better ring? I saved up for 6 months for a 900$ ring for my wife while paying for the bills and only making 10.50 a hour. It’s doable if you budget for it. Another question was did he tell you it was a real diamond? Did you say yes when you thought it was real then say no after you found out? I’m sorry that you feel tricked. It hurts when someone you trust breaks that trust.

I wondered if I was ever going to have the family I wanted.

Like the battle league. You do Raids and as you complete lower lvl raids you get access to higher level Raids and get paired with people at your lvl. 

Another Idea is you use a raid pass to join a raid at lvl of your choosing and get paired up with people who choose that raid too. Not just in your local area but worldwide. Also it would be nice to invite friends to join you in these raids."

Well a neighbor’s dog came running up and my dog isn’t friendly towards dogs she doesn’t know. They weren’t even concerned about it saying that “he’s friendly”. Well I had to literally hold her mouth shut because he came up and was getting up in her space. If I hadn’t stopped her their dog would have been bit and I would have had to pay for it even though my dog was on a harness with a leash.

pokemongo,fp4q2e6,t3_gb45dj,1588304615.0,I started playing about a year ago and I’m (for the most part) happy with the changes they’ve made. I’m not a big fan of the go league but I have friends who love the challenge. I’m not a competitive person so it’s not something that I enjoy doing but it doesn’t mean I can’t find enjoyment in the game. If you don’t want a challenge and want everything handed to you on a silver platter then this isn’t the game for you. Niantic might give freebies every now and then but if you flood the game with 100% IV shiny legendaries then it ruins the uniqueness of having one. Sorry for the long post.

We’re not having a bad relationship but we fight more than I want. I know I have issues and I’m trying to work on them but it’s hard when your spouse doesn’t want to work on the issues as a team. I feel like I’m the more mature one in our relationship but at the same time I feel really dumb about relationships and could use a neutral professional opinion.

I explained to him that wasn’t the case. I’m big on efficiency but I realized that on the outside I came off as cold which can put people on the defensive. I’m generally a friendly person but at work I want to get the job done and go home. I hope this helps.
