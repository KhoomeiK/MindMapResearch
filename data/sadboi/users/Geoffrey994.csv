ChristianUniversalism,fi0cron,t3_f5qp1t,1582033688.0,"I find that the 1st few times, and especially the 1st time, I will not make ANY headway on explaining the concept of Christian Universalism to someone. Merely discussing it with a Christian causes them to have an enormous crisis of faith. Especially when they have thought/struggled about in the past why the concept of a permanent and eternal hell is a conflicting Christian doctrine. A Christian has to go through so many diffrent thought processes when they hear about Christian Universalism before they are even ready to have more than a casual 30 second conversation with them. I mean think about it. There entire Christian lives they have put the problem of hell into a tiny little box and put it in a deep dark corner of there mind because every single one of there religious leaders since they were a child told them to do that. There is no way to magically cross a barrier that has been made for that long in someone‚Äôs life. I know you said you feel more conservative on certain issues in Christianity, but I also happen to find this to be the case when discussing lgbt things and the Bible. What I‚Äôve found and 100% what you may have already found from trying to discuss this with people, is that you can have an effect on them just by your mere existence around them as a universalist. Honestly this is the same with Christians and non Christians to me. The best arguments and discussions I have had with my friends for Christ, have come from me just letting them know through casual conversation and my actions that I love god and I believe god loves everyone too. 

I do find this harder to do however when it comes to universalism and Christians who believe in a permanent unforgiving hell. I find that this version of hell they prop up is the very antithesis of the entire point of the Bible. And that so many are drive away from the message of Jesus because Christians cling to this hardcore message of eternal damnation. Like that makes me want to speak up every time I see a Christian!!

Regardless, just wanted you to know that I feel and understand you. Christians literally will laugh at me when I talk about universalism and then start to get angry when they realize I‚Äôm being serious. It‚Äôs hard to hold a belief that challenges the status quo. Especially when the status quo your challenging is one held up by your other Christian brothers and sisters."

Not only am I about to start grad school and will also have no time to play after.

gay_irl,fgww7lj,t1_fgwryxw,1581166404.0,"Yah we could theorize all day about if it would be worse than saying nothing. But we know absolutely nothing about this person. There are countless people in this thread, myself included, that would be overjoyed if someone came to me and apologized for doing something deeply hurtful to me in the past. But the truth is if someone is deeply hurt psychologically from someone offering a sincere and heartfelt apology, that has no expectation of forgiveness, then that person needs to start seeing a mental health professional immeaditly. It is not healthy or safe to continue through life avoiding memories. Those memories need to be discussed and processed with a medical professional if that individual ever has any hope of recovery. If that person has suppressed and internalized those memories. This could be a catalyst that allows him to go get help for trauma that he has refused to process his entire life. Shit, OP could even be someone who supports him in getting help in the future! I still agree that if OP apologized by saying some bs like ‚Äúyah we‚Äôre good tho right?‚Äù That he might as well have not have said anything at all. But it sounds to me that if OP just shared the truth of how he feels, that he thinks about what he did often and that he is truly sorry for what he did. Even More so because he himself realizes that he is Bi now. That this could be nothing but a net positive event for this person and the world. Our world needs more apologies and kindness. Of course you can never change the past, but you can change how you behave in the future. And I think showing kindness to people you have had a personal history with is something absolutely beautiful."
gay_irl,fgwn4c3,t1_fgvrjqt,1581163399.0,"Yah maybe half-assed apologies are worse than none at all. But a true apology is given from the heart without any expectations of what the opposing party should do with it. I honestly think we need more of that in our world. Everyone has said some mean shit to someone in there life and were not always mature enough to realize what we did in the moment. But yah, giving some half baked apology/excuse for why you did what you did is not appropriate and should just be kept to yourself. But it sounds like OP has thought ab this for a while and who knows, it might change the guy he bullieds perspective as well. He may be internalizing it and has told himself over and over that no one cares and that OP couldn‚Äôt give two shits about the things he‚Äôs said to him, but op could change all of that with a single heartfelt apology."

I guess it Dosent matter now, but I would really like it if they added the messaging service inside the actual Grubhub app itself. I think it would go a long way to be able to showcase my attempts at being professional with the customers delivery.

At the end of the day I feel it could be any number of reasons. I always delivered food on time and checked to make sure items were in the bag to the best of my ability, I‚Äôm guessing either I just had some bad luck and a lot of the customers I ordered too lied about delivery, or that Grubhub is just trying to thin out their numbers.

It is just mind boggling to me that people can read about Jesus and not be absolutely transformed by the love and mercy he speaks about. It‚Äôs overwhelming to me when he tells us that we are all loved by god. More so than any other group in society, Christianity should be the religion of acceptance. How can people be so far off the deep end, that their belief in Christianity is not focused upon the ultimate acceptance of god?? Like that is what makes Christianity so special!!
