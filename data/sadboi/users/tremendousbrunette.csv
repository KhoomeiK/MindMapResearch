She treats Teresa like a giant piece of shit and seems genuinely exasperated by anything Teresa does. I'm behind an episode and watched the scene where Nono gives her the pear and cheese and she turned her nose at it but then asks for sausage. Then she leaves to get her hair done and I thought - despite the situation it's not like the kids were left destitute living in a shack when their parents were incarcerated. She's a brat. She gets what she wants whenever she wants. Joe wants to just be done and go to Italy and she is an asshole thay can't even be logical or empathic for one second. She loves her Dad but sees what kind of hell hole he's in?! Bullshit. 


Then the scene where Teresa was telling Joey about what Joe says to her - they flashback to Joe telling Teresa that he never wanted to get married - IN FRONT OF GIA - and she allows that to be said to her mother and has the goddamn audacity to treat her that way?! Teresa puts up with it because she feels bad for what they went thru. But guess what? A lot of people have gone thru tons of shit and don't end up acting like assholes.
