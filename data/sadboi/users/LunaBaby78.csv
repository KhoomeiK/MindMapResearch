If interested in biological children she would need a fertility doctor consult for sperm harvesting and preservation before starting HRT. But it's not 100% sterility guaranteed so shes happy to take a chance and adopt later if it doesn't happen. 

I suspect most parents know even before their kids ""come out"" as transgender officially. I know we did. And support is so important. She has to have a good support system to help her through her transition (another thing the mental health therapist will talk about for HRT, making sure support is in place). Also, BOTH parents have to sign the consent form here in Maryland (which isn't a problem for us). Alice, my daughter, has every right to be who she is.
