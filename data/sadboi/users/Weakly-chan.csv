depressed,fqn1ixi,t3_gjo8wt,1589487100.0,Yeah dude it’s so sad. I understand. You just want the bad things to go away. My gosh man I feel that pain so much. Try your best to distract yourself from all the b.s the world throws at you. Just live in your own head and stay away from the negative stuff man. It’s not worth it. Just try to not pay too much attention to it. Don’t feel bad about yourself if it’s too hard to do that. It’s a tough world out there. Just try your best to at least block out some of the negative vibes the world is throwing your way.

depressed,fqfjh0y,t1_fqefjrb,1589326000.0,You are 100% right. I think it comes down to the fact that we as humans end up feeling rejected and alone by society. So like since we’re not up to standards in everyone’s eyes we feel worthless and alone. I think we just hate the feeling of being alone and that’s why we care about what so many people think. We fear that others will destroy our lives if we don’t behave or act in a certain way. But I’ve realized that’s all just illusions. Tricks in our mind. So you are right. We should just get used to being in our own body without letting outside forces do that for us. We should get used to feeling comfortable in our own skin no matter the consequences. It’s better to be ourselves and alone than to be miserable with fake people who control your every thought and action.

I don’t know who you are but I love you and you did a great job in your life if you’re still living on this planet today. Just do your own thing man, try new things to see what works. I dunno.
