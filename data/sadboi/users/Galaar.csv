After having them for about a month, I'd suggest the Sennheiser Momentum 3. It was between them and the XM3 at the price of $350, but having experimented with them both, this one matched what I was after best and I dont regret it. 

They swap seamlessly between my PC and phone and it's genuine leather. Sony may set the hardware standard, but they couldn't care less if the cups breathe. These are very durable, important to me as despite my best efforts, I tend to break them at the arm just above the cup. The EQ is controlled by an app, the bass isn't thumping, but a little tweak on the app and it was good enough for me, I use them for both gaming and lounging, nothing heavy in bass.

Their noise cancellation isn't as strong as the XM3, but it's enough for me. When you take them off, the audio will automatically mute and unmute when you put them back on, neat.

There is a transparent hearing option that let's voice in but still mostly blocks the background noise. There is also an option the let the audio either mute or continue when you toggle it, depending on your needs, handy for a quick chat without removing them, like when on a plane for no sound during an order or in the middle of a raid and you want music playing without accidently shouting, yet still blocking out the noise (very specific, I know). This is controlled in the same app as the EQ. Speaking of apps, the Tile app is linked with these, if you lose them, you have something akin to Find My iPhone to use.

The 17 hour battery life is a boon as by that time, if from fully charged, you may be getting a headache, the padding is not meant for marathon sessions or outdoor use. You can keep using them while they are plugged in and charging, not something many headsets can boast that I've used.

There's a few videos from Jim's Review Room that breaks them down individually and one that compares both against a Bose. Since we might have different priorities, I'd highly recommend checking them out, as I can vouch for the accuracy."
HeadphoneAdvice,fpmwsjk,t3_g2zp6g,1588743790.0,"After having them for about a month, I'd suggest the Sennheiser Momentum 3. It was between them and the XM3 at the price of $350, but having experimented with them both, this one matched what I was after best and I dont regret it. 

They swap seamlessly between my PC and phone and it's genuine leather. Sony may set the hardware standard, but they couldn't care less if the cups breathe. These are very durable, important to me as despite my best efforts, I tend to break them at the arm just above the cup. The EQ is controlled by an app, the bass isn't thumping, but a little tweak on the app and it was good enough for me, I use them for both gaming and lounging, nothing heavy in bass.

Their noise cancellation isn't as strong as the XM3, but it's enough for me. When you take them off, the audio will automatically mute and unmute when you put them back on, neat.

There is a transparent hearing option that let's voice in but still mostly blocks the background noise. There is also an option the let the audio either mute or continue when you toggle it, depending on your needs, handy for a quick chat without removing them, like when on a plane for no sound during an order or in the middle of a raid and you want music playing without accidently shouting, yet still blocking out the noise (very specific, I know). This is controlled in the same app as the EQ. Speaking of apps, the Tile app is linked with these, if you lose them, you have something akin to Find My iPhone to use.

They're not interrupting a session, they aren't going to yell at the governor, they just want to be as obnoxious as possible because they're frustrated at the situation and let themselves be fooled by a conman."
