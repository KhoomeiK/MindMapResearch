getdisciplined,f865hwn,t3_dz3moa,1574290196.0,"1. Watch a short motivational vid every morn (the one I watch right now is ""Good"" by Jocko

2. Eat at least 2 servings of fruit and 4 servings of vegetables everyday, stay away from fast food or any junk food (slows you down greatly) and find a calorie limit that works for you'll 

3. Excersise, whether its lifting, running, walking, whatever works for you. Get your blood pumping somehow.

4. Get adequate sleep. This one is huge, if you do not get enough sleep you will be a zombie, period.

5. Get up earlier. If you get up earlier and start your day right you will half your cup half full and you will have more energy for it

I wish the best on your disciplined  journey!"
