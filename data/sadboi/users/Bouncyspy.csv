weddingplanning,flk5cgp,t1_flk4bt4,1585234246.0,"Thank you!! It’s a Justin Alexander! I actually got it from a local bridal shop, but that’s not who is doing my alterations. They recommended this person, but I’m just not at all happy with it. It just looks messy and feels awkward!"
weddingplanning,flk5408,t1_fljz3gm,1585234109.0,"Im sorry - I might have used the wrong wording! She does specialize in bridal alterations and I think she also makes dresses? 

Thank you SO MUCH for your input - that is so helpful! I think that what you’re describing sounds exactly like what I want and way more like the picture I had in my head. 

She’s already installed the bustle and it’s not at all what I was expecting. I expressed my concern and asked if we could change it up and she said it would be an additional charge. Do you think I should take it somewhere completely new at this point or try to explain more specifically what I’m looking for? I’m worried about offending her, but I’m not at all a fan of how it looks or feels."
weddingplanning,fljwnxo,t1_flju9id,1585228592.0,"Thank you!! I didn’t even think about that! I’m worried that I’m going to be the one that rips the whole thing down because it kept getting under my feet!! The seamstress already installed the bustle, but it’s not anything like I was expecting. Do you think I should give her a chance to change it or just cut my losses and go somewhere else? When I mentioned wanting to change it, she said that it would be an extra charge to install a different type of bustle."
weddingplanning,fljwa6j,t1_fljuc36,1585228304.0,Thank you!! This makes me feel better! I always feel like I’m being too fussy.
weddingplanning,fljvr7c,t1_fljvgor,1585227901.0,"She just said it was a four point bustle? At the previous appointment she showed me how it would look and it puddled much less and came to more of a triangular point at the top. She honestly didn’t give me many details, but it looked pretty. She went ahead and installed the bustle when she did the hem and it doesn’t look anything like I was expecting."

weddingplanning,fljugws,t1_fljtlmh,1585226882.0,"Thank you! I mentioned that I was concerned with how much was puddling and that there was no way I could step backward without tearing the whole mess down and she said that you can never step backward in a wedding dress and that’s just how bustles are. I expressed my concern with being able to do our first dance (it’s a waltz!) and she just shrugged and said to be sure to slide my feet instead of actually stepping backward. 

I wasn’t sure if I was just expecting too much or being nuts because she literally does this for a living, but I was pretty disappointed."

Tallahassee,fhwfp8s,t1_fhwc9xy,1581914489.0,"We definitely thought it was the food at first. We went to pick up a new (and hopefully worm free) bag to use while we decided on a new food and noticed that the bag we picked up didn’t feel sealed properly. I picked up a second one and it was covered in a weird web type material, so we left and drove across town to the other Petsmart. We haven’t had any other problems with the food so far!"
Tallahassee,fhw9ufz,t1_fhw7cw1,1581910055.0,"Yep, same store. We’ve started going to the other Petsmart in town. The first time it happened we didn’t see anything until the bag was over half empty, but last time it was a newer bag."

dogs,fh0dyp0,t1_fgzv4xq,1581202897.0,My dog had this same condition a few years ago! It was so scary - we had no idea what was wrong for nearly a month and the vets were stumped until she finally saw a specialist. I wish you the best of luck with your pup!
dogs,fh0daul,t3_f0xxe2,1581202652.0,"Do you believe that it’s really in a dog’s best interest to be neutered? I know that pyrometra is a concern in female dogs and they should be spayed, but I’ve read some studies about neutering increasing the risk of some behavioral issues and even leading to an increased risk of cancer. 

I was very hesitant to get my dog neutered because I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was responsible enough to stop any accidental breeding and because he had zero behavioral issues, but I was finally peer pressured into doing it when he was 18 months old. I’m still not sure that I made the right decision!"

keto,fdn0e47,t1_fdmt55u,1578573347.0,"Thank you so much!! I would definitely put on some weight after the carb crazies. I actually had a cheat period over Christmas that had me eating SO MANY sweets and it was super tough to go back to keto this time around. The cravings the first couple of days were not fun, but I munched on some dark chocolate and nuts and just tried to focus on cutting out the super carb heavy things. I didn’t count calories when I was going through this last adjustment period and just tried to focus on getting the carbs out of my system. By day three I would say that the cravings and constant desire to eat started to subside and then I was able to get back into my normal eating routine. I genuinely feel so much better when I’m eating this way. I always forget how sluggish carb heavy foods make me feel! 

Just remember to not freak out over the number and focus on making healthy eating choices one meal at a time. You’ll slide right back into your routine before you know it! It also helps when I go and fully stock the house with keto options so I never have the “there’s nothing to eat” excuse for McDonalds! The hardest part is always the first couple of days when you start back, but you’ve got this!"

AskVet,etli7k1,t1_etkogdt,1562937140.0,"Thank you for your reply! We spoke to the vet again this morning when we dropped him off. He reiterated that he has seen this condition many times and that in his experience, the rate of success with splinting alone (no surgery) isn’t great in cats at Jabba’s weight. He said that if we chose to postpone surgery and try a conservative approach first, that he’s very willing to do that, but that the odds of surgical success will have decreased if we end up having to do the surgery in 6 weeks. He said that for Jabba to have the best odds of having a fully usable joint, we should move forward with the surgery. They’re going to do his presurgical work up and call us back with the results of everything before they put him under. Fingers crossed that my baby handles the anesthesia well!"

She’s had some long-standing intestinal issues (IBD) and they think that the elevation is related to that.
