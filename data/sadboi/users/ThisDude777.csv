Not sure how many of you are lifelong fans as long as that but doesn't it hurt that the only championship in team history, the very first, was won by cheating? Imagine waiting all your life for a championship, celebrating the fuck out of it, then finding out they got it by cheating. It's just so incredibly deceptive as you've been horribly lied to. Cheating no matter what just doesn't sit right with me I don't care if it's their first time, cheating is cheating. This isn't just a simple fault thats putting it very lightly. They cheated their way to winning a championship. When the whole cheating scandal came out with the Patriots I felt the same way, demonizing them and ridiculing them for cheating it's despicable. Now that a team that I love and support does the same thing, arguably worse, I just can't go on supporting them. Only memory I'm throwing out is the faulty championship in 2017, it's sickening."

Porn is such a terrible normalized part of our society, I think like with most things it could be fine in moderation for some people but not me. I'm lucky enough to be in a relationship where we're both open about about our dislike of porn as it makes the both of us incredibly insecure. If I could give any advice I'd say try telling him how it makes you feel, and if he really cares about you he'll understand that cutting this part out of his life or cutting down on it will help you immensely. I felt the same way the first time I thought about bringing it up because like you said I didn't want to be controlling, especially in todays society with porn being so normalized. Trust me you're not controlling for wanting your boyfriend to stop looking at other naked women.  It breaks my heart truly reading posts like this because I know exactly how you feel. As far as your other posts in this thread with the fleshlight I can totally relate. Me and my GF are in a LDR and a couple days after she went home after spending Christmas together she brought up wanting a dildo and I just didn't know how to respond. Like you I didn't want to be the toxic controlling person and inhibit their own needs their body their choice and everything but at the same time it made me so so uncomfortable and I just had to tell her that. I told her how that makes me feel unwanted and uncomfortable and she understood, she said if I came out and said I wanted a fleshlight then she would feel the same way."
