depression,f9s4gpu,t3_e6onv2,1575585799.0,"Hello 🌾 

It's human to feel how you do, your Ego/Mind will play tricks as it will feel betrayed, however this hasn't taken away anything you have already enjoyed and experienced. 

I understand your predicament and I'm sure many here can sympathize and have experienced a similar experience or situation. Of course this doesn't mean its trivial, but rather important that you helped her so much and of course eachother. For two beings to show understanding and for that length of time whilst both feeling depressed. You can relate and that's important to any relationship 🌱🌞

 No one can take away the time you spent or future times again, this doesn't void your freindship with her, unless if it's what you want. Two years can seem like a life time. Why not  savour it 🌞🌻"

Or anotherwise man said - speed is ok as long as you are the only one who has it, but once everybody has it everyone is just working faster and but not getting anywhere further, and tiring out.

Slavery was never abloshised, it just now includes all the  colours. Houses can be seen as cells to a prison which you work to payoff. 20% of my wealth goes to the king in the castle which is now called the government. 

It doesn't take long on the 20th century to find your self living under a bridge."

I would say drugs can be a means of self harm or at least can be as described in the psychology books.

I have many experiences with psychedelics. I once randomly met a nice woman in a bench, could prob smell the weed I was smoking , either way we had a long chat u learned at lot, she even showed me her wrist scars, we must have got on well, she also said she used aerosol, I couldn't understand it , I said the strongest psychedelic known to man is DMT, she was wanted to know more and I did too...   

I would like to chat with your self to learn more and also we can chat 😊 of course there's many thoughts rushing around and for 14 years old I bet you have experienced more than some people do in there life time. I have problems too, and we should chat 😊   your most likely very wise, and see the world differenly than most."

The reason everything for why this is, is in the definition of meme.

: an element of a culture or system of behaviour passed from one individual to another by imitation or other non-genetic means.
