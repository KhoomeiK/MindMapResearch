depression,fr5fs3b,t3_gmfffa,1589907842.0,"I used to hate myself, still kind of do. 

But when I began to address these ideas about myself: being a loser, ugly, worthless, hopeless, stupid, etc, I realized that most of them were not true and I was not as disgustingly pathetic as I thought. 

Very difficult task to reach down in our suffering in an attempt to heal, but I have to say; all along, what I really needed to do was learn to hug my own defected, mentally twisted self. 

We are, in many cases, all we have. The only one on our side forever, is us. 

That same person that holds the qualities to get better, and consequently, make life better. 

But I know talk is cheap and you’re probably like, “this dude needs to fuck off with that bullshit” and that is okay, I used to be there, and it still lingers. 

However, I have felt a similar pain than what you are living and I know it is very real suffering and know it only alleviated when I learned to not hate myself so much. 

Les Brown and Jim Rohn helped with that. 

Check them out. 

May the force be with you.

intj,fr5dujv,t3_gmma6t,1589906931.0,"If that is a symbol of happiness in your mind, you may be in trouble as you are essentially rejecting a piece of “happiness” for yourself. 

However, a lone-wolf can find plenty of reason to be happy outside a relationship. 

Like books: They will always be there. They will never call you names. They will always be open to share helpful ideas. They will never lie (unless it’s a religious book). They will never leave you nor forsake you. They don’t cheat (unless it’s a cheat code book). They will be by your side, literally forever. Not to mention raise the likelihood of personal and life successes. This sounds like love to me. 

Just one example of goodness outside of having to be glued to another human until you die. 

P.S. I don’t really think love is real, so I could be missing out on so much but I’ll cope by reading.

However, sadness, does not have the capabilities to convince a human that life is not worth living, and help them to carry out such an act (60% of suicides are linked to a mood disorder) and sadness does not typically blanket your entire life, making it hard to eat or do the things you always loved to do.
