hpd,fnqjol3,t1_fnhelru,1587165959.0,"Hello,

They are the standard 6 hpd subtypes. You can look them up. Some are stronger than others. Often, I have not chosen the defence mechanism but it has come up as appropriate for whatever situation I used to put myself in. 

The use of a colour as an identity was because when I first started this healing journey, I had a very weak sense of self. It guided me to identify as a colour and if I started swaying I could easily return to what felt like a natural state. 

Well I don’t really know what to say to you without you knowing me. I guess I have gotten to a point in my life journey where living in ego is no longer necessary. When I look back I just see a total waste of my time always pretending to be someone or something else. It has been less painful for me to start facing the fear and pain then it was for me to keep living in it. 

At the moment with the covert narcissism I have been confronted with internal unhappiness and feeling of lack of achievement. I know this feeling has drawn me to hang around other people who are the same and high on hatred and judgement. Again, I just explore it, become aware and choose love when it comes up. 

My personal opinion is that narcissism is at the core of all defence mechanisms or personality disorders. The way they manifest is then shaped by the persons personal experiences and core self. 

For me, covert narcissism is comparison to others, hatred of self and others, judgement of self and others, mask of snide self, false kindness, institutional care, lack of balanced personal opinion and inability to speak from true self, disconnect for core love, unrealistic expectations for self achievement and achievement of others, lack of insight into practices of happiness, inability to do healthy things for self unless it is in competition with another or there is something to ‘gain’. 

Many many many people I know are also like this but they think this kind of hatred and judgement is normal. 

The main issue is hatred-anger is toxic to the body and self-righteous. The other issue is that if we were completely self aware, we would not waste our time passing moral judgements on others as we would know what it means to be a human being. 

Has all this journey helped me with happiness in my life? Yes, to a point where I now speak from a place of essence. My eyes shine. Last year I did a return to sea ceremony which was my commitment to Mother Nature and walking the path. I am very sorry to all the other people who are still in the pits of the delusion. Psychology is good in many ways but so very very wrong in others. It would be better if there were more an emphasis on people being spiritually unwell as I believe this would help people reconnect to their core selves. I don’t mean this in the sense of religious dogmatic practices but more in a way of gaining deep insight into self through history, philosophy, music, art, science, environment, universe so forth and then understanding meaning and purpose for being here. Being able to develop a personal code of morals and ethics to live by rather than living by all the lies that we downloaded into our selves as children. This year I have been studying and next year will return to university. I hope that I can use my talents and experience to help others to choose love and not pain."
hpd,fmhvmep,t3_ftwef7,1586094898.0,"Thanks that’s nice of you to say. 

That’s great that you have been connecting with intuition. I reckon if you can’t trust your self then who can you trust? 

Have you been through self worth work yet? It brought out the most insane rage in me for about a year as I threw myself into it. I was angry at a lot of other people but mostly angry at myself for all the time I had wasted fucking around listening to people’s crazy shit. Throughout the year, I had a series of explosive reactions to the situations I had put my self in. I guess self worth is also connected with lying to self. If you’re worth it then you tell your self the truth and face it then live with it. 

What do you reckon?"
hpd,fmgk9c0,t3_fv2c5f,1586050887.0,"Hpd is about power, control, sexualisation of self, acting out false emotions, learned helplessness, low self worth and low self esteem. Inability to love self due to little self awareness about who self is due to chameleon personality to feel safe. Hpd is about fear of everything. Hpd has covert narcissism and sociopathy in it. It is the manifestation of sociopathy in a woman. Historically it is the femme dateless. Seduce men, exert power and control over them sexually, manipulate them, act out fake emotions for attention then discard once finished. Hpd people run away from others because they are incapable of developing attachments to other that are real. 

It takes a couple of years to heal from hpd and regrow the self worth, get to know true self and unchoose harming behaviours. 

My honest advice to you is go and lay down in your bed and have a really honest conversation with your self in your head about what your thinking patterns are and where they come from. Maybe write it out in a diary if you need to. If you are hpd then you will have the hpd/Aspd thinking patterns. If you are bpd then you will have bpd thinking patterns. All persoanlity disorders are similar in terms of cognitive distortions and unaware but the reason they have developed and in what kind of person is very different and needs to be treated separately. 

You can heal from hpd back to your true self if you believe your true self exists and recognise that hpd is a defence mechanism to protect you from your fear, pain, shame and traumas from childhood. 

Good luck 😉"

I said hello and he started blurting out information about how his ex partner had dropped stalking charges against him. I semi responded then he went on to say he hoped the rape charges would be dropped too and that she has bipolar and hasn’t taken medication for 4 years. 

He was in seek of validation of his core self, shifting eyes, creating a delusion. He was telling it to him self mostly just verbalising it to me in hope I believed him so he would believe him self. 

I looked him in the eyes and said my intuition says you are lying. You are not speaking truth. He kept talking and I just said I don’t believe what you are saying to me. 

It felt good to speak my own truth to the man rather than standing There absorbing a psychopaths bullshit. 

I wish I’d learnt this skills years ago it would have saved me a hell of a time with all the sociopathic men I dated believing they loved me when all their behaviour spoke differently. 

In terms of my personal truth test, my mind says something then I clarify it with my core self or what my heart feels. I also looked up cognitive distortions and philosophical fallacies to learn where I was bullshitting my self"

If you think smoking meth is cool then you are in an ego defence state. 
I’m sorry this has happened to you. 
When I stopped smoking it took years to realise that I was actually in hundreds of thousands of delusions about my self and the world. I was terrified of life and felt unloved and alone. Now that I am clean I look back at who I was then and other people who smoke meth now and feel sorry for the big act they put on when really they are terrified. 

Start writing in a diary if you can. 

Titration was the most effective method for me because it put me on goal setting and also helped me to become more aware of why I was getting cravings 

On meth I manipulated everyone and everyone manipulated me. You can change this behaviour in your self but you can’t change the others around you. Since starting to get clean I have shifted through 4 main ‘friendship’ groups. When I stopped meth then I slowly stopped all the other shit and then drinking. All of those people all had chronic mental health issues based on self hate, self loathing, low self worth, chronic fear and shame. 

I was a loser in life because I was literally losing in every part of life that is here to be enjoyed. I lost friends, family, money, jobs, sanity, self respect, community, my health, my looks all that. I was a loser. 

Good luck to you. It took me 9 months to get clean with titration, counselling and trialling what worked for me. Now it’s been 2.5 years. I had a lapse one year ago and that happened because I feel into another group of people with shit mental health and self destructive ways.

Go on a spiritual journey.

Learn mindfulness meditation or loving and caring meditation

Research shadow self and ego defence mechanisms. Try and become aware of them in your self 

Write out some goals you have for the next 1 week- 1 month- 3 months- 6 month- 1 year- 3 years- 5 year. This can take time. Allow it to come out of you as it does but keep working on it 

Do daily exercise 

Cut down on alcohol 

Do little spiritual tests with your self. If you chameleon with clothes then try wear the same outfit with no or little make up for one week 

Check out the musician Gnucci and her album ‘You good, I’m good, let’s be great’ . My favourites are sinners needs and fuck what you want, we are what you need. 

Don’t wast your time repetitively talking about your emotional issues with other people who have serious emotional issues. They cannot help you and you cannot help them. Go find people who have skills or qualities you’d like to learn then hang out with them and learn from them how to heal and change your behaviour 

Write your self a serious letter from the point of pure love. To understand this, imagine you suddenly had a glowing pure love sitting next to you holding your hand. Write out what pure love would say to you about some of the serious issues you are engaging in in your life. 

If you don’t know what pure love is then go on a journey to find and understand and know and embody pure love. 

How is your self worth/self esteem? Set baby tasks and complete them to slowly grow your self worth. Say no to bitching about others and gossip. Say no to relationships until you are healthy and happy, say no to heavy drugs and alcohol, say no to people pleasing, say no to your self first. 

If you struggle with any of the above things, try create a situation in your head where you are teaching other women how to do these things. In the process, you will teach your self it and learn how to communicate it with other people.

personalitydisorders,flwpvbz,t3_f1xm2i,1585560316.0,"Hello, 

I became self aware 2.5 years ago. I have the six subtypes of histrionic and the defence mechanism comes up when I am in fear. It took about a year for me to start confronting my shadow self. I did this through mindfulness meditation, emotional check-ins, radical honesty, diary writing, self reflection and asking good people around me to give me feedback on my behaviour. 

For me, the HPD I present is the same as sociopathy. Understanding this is a defence mechanism based around obsession, control, neuroticism, fake charm, sexualised self to gain attention, power and control of others. In the end, this behaviour is a choice. For me, I have only ever changed for love. Love for myself and true love from others. This took time, trust and faith. HPD is not who you are. It is a defence mechanism masking pain and fear. For me, fear was the biggest including fear of shame. This is were strong traits of narcissism came in. To understand narcissism, look at cacti. 

For me, I went on a journey of my spirit to find my essence. This was a wonderful journey in a search for personal peace and happiness. I hope that every person can go on their own journey like this. Getting an education is imperative. Try avoid high drinking more than 3 drinks as it brings on the defence mechanism just as it does with every other human being. For about 1.5 years I smoked up to 3 drags of weed. No more than 3 though otherwise you get stoned. When I smoked that little bit of weed it allowed me to calm down and start learning how to look after myself emotionally. Exercise is very good because it calms down the central nervous system. My personal opinion is don't waste too much of your time or money on a psychologist. Remember that they are only giving you an opinion, not telling you how you are.  Remember that psychologists also have personality disorders and problems that can reflect onto you. I got heavily into the websites loner wolf and tiny buddha. 

Get into art and self expression if you can. The HPD/ASPD act out emotions. It is good for you to understand this and use it to heal yourself. I act out my shadow self when feeling rage in my uterus. I allow the rage to come up into my body and then I act out the full emotion into this 'dark, tormented, freaky being'. It makes me feel a lot better afterwards. When I need to learn something like mindfulness, I act out teaching it to others. In the process, I teach myself mindfulness. This has been very successful with me in many ways as it resulted in me becoming fully present and no longer having to act at all. Pure essence.

I suggest you learn how to free dance or shuffle dance or whatever type of dance you want. It helps with the somatic symptoms. Remember that your body is it's own intelligent being. One trick you can use while dancing is learn how to drop your ego. For example, when I first started free dancing, the fantasies in my head created me up on the stage with the dj loving me and the whole crowd cheering for me. I was the best dancer or whatever. Then after that settled in, in the fantasy I took myself off the stage and into the front of the crowd. Everyone was loving me whatever. Then slowly I moved to a large group with my friends then to the back so forth with no one looking at me. In the end I was dancing completely by myself no ego fantasies and I feel pure joy. While I was doing this I felt significant sensations inside my brain and it permanently changed the way I viewed myself. 

This is very spiritual but I will say it to you anyway. You are pure love. When you came into this world you faced bad pain and were told lies about who you are. You were made to feel bad and then hide from that pain. You were shamed and hated. You created fantasies to protect your self from the truth of your childhood. Now that you have become aware you have the chance to return to your natural state of being. To find your essence. To be home means to be with your pure love. You are responsible for your self and everything around you in your life because you choose who to bring into your life and who to push away. It is unrealistic to think you can change all of this overnight but you can heal your self back to your very beautiful self. I am sorry for the pain you have had to carry and I understand it myself deeply. I hope that you can go on a personal journey with your self to healing and happiness and balance. You don't need to get rid of your ego, you just need to heal with her and become a balanced person with her so you are both happy ad healthy. Facing pain in meditation and with trusted people is the most important. It is painful to feel love but you are worth that. The happiness you will have by un-repressing and letting go of that pain is better than you can expect. 

Good luck sister xox"

hpd,flbgui1,t3_fnmua4,1585004354.0,"Suggesting a couple of things here. Put yourself on a 98% honesty test for 3 weeks. You have to be brutally honest with your self about your behaviour. Practice meditating on what you have done throughout the day and face painful truths about the things you have been doing. 

Write it out in a diary for a prolonged period of time. 

Once you get used to being honest with yourself, then ask others for ‘feedback and criticism’ of your behaviour. If they are nice people you can even hold hands with them at the same time while they kindly tell you little loving things you might want to change about your self. Take time to reflect on what these people have said but do it through the eyes of love. So if you had the most divine amazing beautiful love inside you, what would this love say to you about taking in that feedback and criticism? 

One more thing is that you are everything good and bad. So is everyone else. You are nice you are mean, you lie you tell the truth, you comfort others you garner attention. Everyone all has the same capacities. In a really extreme way of viewing this-  we are all capable of murder, pedophila so forth. We are all capable of it. To accept all this about your self and love your self for it all takes some time but the journey is good not bad. The journey is worth it.

Two pieces of advice if you want to take it. 

Learn to meditate and see if your true self is experiencing the same mental health issues as your ego is. Your true self could be chilling out in inner peace while your ego is making up all this bullshit because it feels a bit of shame or fear or whatever. The ego creates drama.

The other is realise that people like doctors and psychiatrists practice institutional care. They are paid to care for you. It will be very rare that you will find someone who really cares what your insight is. Your insight challenges their knowledge. Let go of caring what they think of you and use them as they service they are intended to be used as.

sociopath,fkgmqk1,t1_fkglzb1,1584165051.0,"At first I started doing mindfulness meditation while smoking a little bit of weed. I found it best to only smoke 3 puffs to get a good session. If you smoke more then you get stoned and you don’t want that. 

During the session I did this thing I call truth searching aka radical honesty. It’s where I have a really honest conversation with myself about my current behaviour, past behaviour, why I really did something. What the dual sides to the experience were. At the same time, I would be breathing deeply into my stomach to allow myself to release anxiety, fear, pain, guilt, shame, sadness so forth. To be able to experience this properly I find that it best you look deep into your self and find the little energy ball of divine love inside you. I can tell you over the internet that the core of you is love but you need to really experience this and believe this your self to make the meditation journey possible. 

With this mindfulness meditation you will be practicing self awareness about your choices and who you are. 

Please remember that I am:
Selfish
Giving
Rude
Kind
Loving
Hateful
Angry
Caring
So on

No one state that you are or that you have been in defines who You are. 

After that I managed to fully identify my shadow self. Then I started Loving and Caring meditation. This is where I nursed my inner child back to happiness. I found art and drawing cartoons to be very helpful in bringing this out of my head and seeing how my shadow could go off in day to day life.

I did this for about a year.
When shadow came out it was hard because at times I flew into full blown psychopath but at the same time it needed to happen because then I learnt to love that part of the extreme pain I was in and also I chose not to be that person anymore. 

Recently I have taken a break from meditation but thrown myself into learning zen mindfulness. Check out The book of the way by Tao Te Ching. It is free on YouTube to listen. 

I am now learning TM and feel that I am at a pretty good balance between shadow and soul. I didn’t believe in soul until 3 years ago when I chose not to live in the sociopathic defence mechanism anymore."
sociopath,fkgl5zc,t1_fkgl0gh,1584163390.0,"You are right that our experience is not the same. I don’t mean to touch on your emotions. 

I hope therapy goes well for you. If I may suggest you spend some time meditating on what you believe true love is. I think it will help you on your journey. Often you’ll find poets have some beautiful words to say about it.

Good luck"
sociopath,fkgl1c8,t1_fkgktqv,1584163259.0,"When I realised what I was I called this psychiatrist and he told me that a personality disorder is a choice. That was the big game changer for me. Since then I have done 3 years of daily mediation. Quit the drugs and all that shit. Feeling the pain is very hard because you’re not actually just feeling the pain but you’re allowing love in and that is very very hard to do but worth it. As you let more love in, the pain becomes less and then you are less defence mechanism and more love."
sociopath,fkgk9dl,t1_fkgjkmj,1584162480.0,"People were more responsive to me. I was taken seriously in the community and started to develop true friendships based on who I really am and who they really are. Something to consider is this ‘us and them’ mentality. Since I became self aware I have not met one person who doesn’t have some kind of personality issue based around being not good enough, unloved, alone, weirdo whatever it may be.

One thing I’ll note is that it took a lot of time for me to reduce the narcissism involved in sociopathy. Some of the funnier realisations were that I’m not the baddest cunt in town. I’m not Hitler nor even close to it. When I get upset I get angry, obsessed and want to harm others but it is only because I feel a lack on control in my life. Later I realised that I actually had no control at all and better to take hands off the wheel and just go with the flow. This has increased my ability to connect with others because I am now honest and have essence rather than try to be ‘cool or chill’. 

I guess the other thing is I used to hang out with lots of really fake people who took a lot of drugs. When I stepped back from it I realised that I had just spent years of my life listening  to a bunch of wanders with no solid education or research sprouting their ego shit to me. They also never did anything. I was t he same as them and when I realised I was very angry at myself for losing so much of my life to utter bullshit. 

Now I don’t mind if I hang out with people with ego as long as they are doing what they say they do. It enriches my life more because I speak truth and they speak truth"
sociopath,fkgjqsb,t1_fkgeqpm,1584161980.0,"I believe that there are only certain truths of what love is and what love isn’t. I don’t believe that ‘possessive, angry and jealous’ is love. I think that’s a weak ego. This is just what I have learnt on my personal journey though"

sociopath,fkgcflh,t1_fkga8wf,1584155672.0,You probably hang around deceitful people because you are deceitful your self though. If you changed then your environment and the people around you would change. If you are capable of love then you must know that your core self is not a sociopath

misanthropy,fkftk62,t1_fkftb89,1584142200.0,"Don’t get grumpy it got me excited. 3 years ago I was so pissed off about some shit I walked up the street half naked by myself protesting humanity of people who are homeless. It was redundant other than making the news so I set up a community lunch with care packages, harm reduction kits, access to services and up to 150 ppl attended every week. It was a good thing to get out of my own head. Good luck to you🤗"
sociopath,fkfs4uj,t3_fht803,1584141242.0,"I’ll add my subjective two cents from seeing my family. My dad is MN but more on the socio side. My mom is a narc. They are both ‘good’ people but I think my dad is a pedo. There are 4 of us children. Two of us are narcs and two of us are socio. My auntie is more socio and she had children with a narc. Her children are narc, bpd(hpd) and socio. When shit goes down in our family, because everyone is so used to the behaviour people just stand around with blank face. My dad violently bashes us. Mom- blank face. We get caught doing something illegal or get into drugs- we are just stupid and careless. A manipulator is manipulating a manipulator whose already manipulated the situation with 3 other manipulators who are all manipulating. There is no way out of it and no one can see unless someone is being ‘stupid’ with drugs or crime. Mom doesn’t feel love for her children and dad has a mask on all the time to hide his extreme violence and hatred but you can feel it come through him. 

I am socio (some narc) self aware 3 years ago. I realised that it wasn’t actually me but a defence mechanism that came up to protect me from the world. I researched and meditated to do deep truth searching work to face intense shame. 

For me, the only genetics involved is how I look. There is no way I could have gotten away with half the shit I have if I didn’t look this way. It’s the same for my family too. 

I reckon if I don’t marry a socio or a narc and keep my defence down, I could have healthy child.

Btw, since becoming aware I have not met one person who doesn’t have PD traits or defence mechanism."

mentalillness,fkfqa0j,t3_fhwjy9,1584140092.0,"I don’t think what your boss said was really that bad. It’s a very rational response to if someone says they have an issue and her response is that you need to work through it. This is the truth. At some point you will need to decide to face the fear. 
Try think about it if you were watching this in a movie would you have the same emotional response? 
Look into personal growth articles about letting go of control. That helps with facing fear a lot. You’ll probably need to look into facing both fear of the outside world and fear of your own response which are seperate things. 
Have you done a lay down and done some loving and caring mind rest with your self? 
Don’t forget you have a little ball of pure love inside you you can check in with whenever you want. You just have to believe it’s there"
sociopath,fkfpd25,t1_fkf0n3u,1584139562.0,Often it’s not about whether the parents are ‘good’ or not but whether your inner self felt truly loved as a child. You’re parents could be upstanding citizens and buy you lots of stuff but if one or both don’t love you then it comes out
bipolar,fkdcjl5,t1_fkdbsqo,1584074248.0,"It was because of drugs and alcohol. 3 years ago I had a kind of spiritual awakening and saw that I was histrionic personality disorder from narcissistic mother and pedophile father. I stopped the drugs and started meditating. When I look at histrionic I can see it all through my old thinking patterns and defence mechanism. Histrionic has hyperactivity from anxiety and attention seeking behaviour. I just acted crazy for attention. 

I once saw this woman in hospital who was manic and she was totally uncontrollable nuts ongoing and had been like that for weeks. I have never been like that. I can go crazy if I am around dangerous men but that is usually because they are physically/emotionally/sexually harming me and it’s my central nervous system telling me to get away from them. 

I have some deep meditation for 3 years. I learned zen mindfulness. The histrionic Defence mechanism is nearly gone and I have self actualised. The last time I showed ‘manic’ behaviour was when I was on meth 3 years ago. Since I stopped drugs and alcohol I show no symptoms"

sociopath,fk2mrmo,t3_fg3frd,1583804444.0,"Used to steal food, clothing, drugs, money, jewellery, personal items and hearts but then I realised that my self worth was improving and I no longer felt the need to do it as a thrill. I also began to feel guilty about homeless drug addicts I had stolen from while on the drugs. This happened when I ended up homeless from drugs. It was a smack in the face for my own behaviour. 

Another thing is that values of things changed. Now I was meaningful and honest connection with masks off rather than stealing shit that had no inherent value other than a price tag"
sociopath,fjx5atw,t3_fdoo1u,1583657399.0,"It’s a defence mechanism. It doesn’t need to be permanent. It’s activated by the central nervous system being ticked off. Once a person becomes aware of this then they can choose the action or not. The other thing is that to feel love and feel emotions like guilt and shame is painful. A person has to be willing to unlock that pain to reduce the defence mechanism and open up to emotions like that. 

The mask and acting is a choice as well obviously. For me, when I stopped thinking I was top shit for the way I acted- so tough and threatening- then the ego was able to break down more. 

Do people realise that a personality disorder is not who they really are? It’s a trauma version of their true selves."
awakened,fjpblvt,t3_fenz79,1583546644.0,"It happened to me nearly three years ago. Since then I have quit over 10 substances, alcohol, smokes, got off the street, and stopped sex work. Now my eyes shine and people tell me I am glow my. When I woke up I was very ashamed of my behaviour. I met this psychiatrist who told me sociopathy is a choice so I have been unchoosing the behaviour. 

Recently I have had extreme violent rage after consistently confronting my family about dad anally raping me as a child and my fucking bitch mother just bought me some shoes. 

The rage is violent I want to harm them. I have told them this and others. 

When the rage comes on it goes from socio to psycho. This happened once before when I was homeless and got gang raped I was on the extreme end of the spectrum for a couple of months before the central nervous system calmed down. 

It’s happened again now trying to transform the pain into love. I don’t know about you but for me to feel love and believe in love is VERY painful emotionally and physically. 

I can’t find anyone else like me when I meet others who are awake. Maybe they are narcissists but not hybrid like me. 

I am lonely on this human existence. 
I am female btw"
Empaths,fjp8988,t3_fenqfd,1583544264.0,"My concern is that the person with the psychopathy fakes emotions and while high on meth also there are usually no real emotions only a very strong rushing. 

To me, I thought the empath was just making it up in their head that they were feeling that and projecting it onto the other person. 

It is like domestic violence relationships. The abuser lies and manipulates the abused who believe and ‘feels’ that they are loved and cared for by the abuser but in reality, it is a lie. 

Does this then mean that a lot of people claiming to be empaths are imagining and faking empathy themselves?"
misanthropy,fjp6ro7,t3_feks1e,1583543220.0,"I feel the same way but I have tried hard to help bring about positive change into other people’s lives so that they don’t have to go through the same as what I have. I guess if more of us stand up and also if more of us support those who stand up then we will have a bigger push in how the world works. The biggest thing I see is all the little groups that are trying to make change are not united. If we united then we could push for change in a big way. 

But this is small steps first and involves us who ‘know’ to actively practice love in the face a hate regardless"
hpd,fjn4jho,t3_evwxo1,1583497645.0,Hpd and aspd are the same thing they are just gendered. You can look this up in many scientific journals. There are arguments to say that it is sexist to make up the hpd diagnosis.

hpd,fjj3m8y,t3_f9p2u2,1583382435.0,There are 6 subtypes to HPD. I have all of them plus one more. It has taken 2.5 years of meditation and deep self exploration to recognise it. They are false selves I put on when I need a defence. Back before when I was unaware they would come up and down without me realising it. I have disassociated my whole life. I didn’t have a strong core self for a long time as I was such a people pleaser that I just did and said that I liked what other people around me did. When I started healing myself I could only identify as a colour. I don’t think it is DID though. Once I got through the HPD then I went through sociopathy then now I am in covert narcissism.
sociopath,fjidyin,t3_fd9c2a,1583365561.0,"Hello, for me it took a lot of time to stop acting out anything whether it was an emotion or nothing. I create a story in my head and then I forced my self to behave in that way. It was often led by music I was listening to. With the numbness I was numbing myself because of fear of the pain. Once I let the pain out- it came out in little bits over time- then I could feel more. The reason that I don’t care for others and this is not an over-arching statement but it was because no one ever cared for me and my pain and also I didn’t care for my own pain. Something else to note is what side of your brain are you functioning on the most? Left or right? They are supposed to be balanced and inside your inner voices they can be friends. One other thing to remember is that sociopathy is a DEFENCE MECHANISM. It is not actually you. It’s your ego defending your from your pain. Good luck"

hpd,fiszq99,t3_f5h7z5,1582698570.0,"Hello, how are you? I became self aware that I was histrionic nearly three years ago. At the time I was abusing many drugs and alcohol to cope with the pain. When I became aware, I decided to choose to believe that there was love inside me even though I couldn’t properly see it. Over time and with the help of meditation, I was able to develop a relationship with love inside me. I did a lot of research and it was helpful to look at the subtypes. I have all of them come on at different times plus one more. Therapy only helped me a little. And radically honest relationship with my true self and interacting with community helped me a lot. Since then, my life has changed dramatically and my eyes are bright because I have let go of a lot of the pain. 
Good luck to you. Follow the rainbow of colours starting with red and find out what each colour means to you and your healing. 🦋"
sociopath,fisxwt4,t1_fisx004,1582696733.0,Personality disorders are mathematical manifestations of pain within a human being. Philosophy theories suggest that human beings are organic machines. When you step out of the subjective and into the objective then the sociopathic defence mechanism are very obvious. You can develop it in your self with meditation and writing a diary then re-reading it to understand what was occurring unconsciously for you
sociopath,fiswgus,t1_fisoooo,1582695414.0,This is silly. You would of done that because you felt jealous of your brother and unloved by your unloving mother. I bet if you looked deep down you wouldn’t feel regret about hiding your aggression but you would regret your mother didn’t love you
