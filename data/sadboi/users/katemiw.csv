They come up with the plan to run Principal Honey out of town but then, like during the bacchanal in the book, things go too far and someone dies. Then in both stories someone starts to crack under the weight of the secret (Reggie/Bunny) and then the other characters eventually kill him to protect themselves, and in both stories there's someone who's the mastermind behind the plan, calculating everything and trying to hold everyone else together (Betty and Jughead/Henry). Not positive that it was supposed to be a callback to the book, but similar nonetheless.

I read The Secret History several months ago so it's still relatively fresh in my memory and I got so excited when Riverdale starting referencing it, lol."

(Not that that’s a reason not to try to convince them!)

I keep going back and forth with this, debating between “Well, they’re adults, I’m not going to be able to change them” and “I have to keep trying because this is life or death.” But, at the end of the day, you’re right—they’re going to do what they’re going to do, and probably the best thing is to try to let go of worrying about it so much.

I remember seeing a chart once that broke down different Christian denominations in the U.S. by party affiliation and LCMS was one of the most conservative, although I haven’t been able to track the chart down since.

Personal anecdotes: When we did mock elections at my LCMS school, the conservative always won by a landslide, including in 2008 (so our election results weren’t just mirroring the actual election). Presumably because most kids had the political views of their parents at that age.

Also, there was a church member who was liberal and had a bunch of liberal/hippie bumper stickers on his car and I remember my parents and a couple of other members acting scandalized by it."

I'm also really thankful that after living in a garden apartment last year, I'm now in a bigger apartment with a lot more sunlight. I think at my last place I would have felt like I was holed up in a bunker if I had to stay inside this much. 

I've mostly settled into a routine of making sure I'm texting with a few people a day and just checking the news in the morning/evening and maybe a couple times during the day rather than really frequently to avoid getting totally wrapped up in it.

Like you said, it's not my fault.  I think part of my lowered anxiety is that in my daily life, there are fewer things to be anxious about--I'm no longer coming home and overanalyzing an interaction with a coworker, or feeling stressed at the idea of having to run errands after work. And I think it's also the fact that in comparison to the pandemic, everything else seems small and meaningless. I'm no longer spending my day analyzing what I'm doing or worrying that I should be doing more or doing something else or feeling like I need to fix something. I'm no longer comparing myself to people and feeling inadequate and unimpressive because we're sort of all stuck in the same place right now (which I say with the understanding, obviously, that a lot of people's socioeconomic and geographic situations put them at more or less risk than others right now--but on a basic human level, we're basically all just sitting and waiting and hoping for the best)."

I didn't even think about her and my dad being at risk going to church, so that's a new thing to worry about, because I know they won't stop going. :/ Meanwhile, my mom will continue to go take care of my 90 year old grandmother and then act like she's ""doing everything she can"" because she washes her hands a lot.

I saw someone else on here mentioning being into bandom around like 2013 and that now there’s even another wave of emo nostalgia happening again (which is probs going to get even bigger with MCR back). It was especially weird coming across pop punk band fandoms in the 2010s on Tumblr because a lot of those people were discussing social justice on their blogs, sometimes even in relation to those bands, which felt so far removed from the 2000s wave of emo/pop punk.

The other Tumblr music era that stands out to me from this time period was when AM by Arctic Monkeys came out. Not sure how big the overlap between these two circles was but I think they definitely shared some aesthetic elements, even if the Arctic Monkeys fans were trying to be a little darker or edgier maybe.

exchristian,fdkifov,t3_ellhra,1578504472.0,"I’ll just speak on my own experience and perspective here. I grew up Missouri Synod Lutheran, which is pretty conservative. I know not every church teaches the same things, but here are my reasons for still feeling a lot of resentment toward the church (and its schools) years later:

Our supposed relationship with God is pretty much textbook abuse and manipulation. We’re born through no choice of our own but immediately are inherently sinful, and then spend the rest of our lives having to be repentant and feel personally responsible for Jesus dying because somebody ate an apple once and now we’re all innately awful because of it? If God were real, he’s horribly emotionally and psychologically abusive, as we pretty much have to spend our whole lives trying to appease him and begging him for things via prayer while being subject to his arbitrary actions over us. I think being taught this is extremely dangerous and damaging.

Another huge thing is bigotry. Plenty of Christians are anti-racist, pro-LGBTQ rights (or LGBTQ themselves), pro-choice, etc. And a LOT of them are not, which is understandable given that homophobia and sexism are right there in the text of the Bible. Obviously not every Christian believes that the Bible is the inerrant truth, but many many do, and use it as justification to deny others their rights."

I fully understand where you’re coming from re: activism and people not really getting what it’s like to be closeted. Most of what I consider to be my LGBTQ community are close friends or more general social events and spaces where there’s not much pressure to be 100% out, but unfortunately still being closeted in a significant area of my life is what’s held me back from really getting involved in activism in a way I would like to.

It’s fantastic that more and more people are becoming accepting, especially as younger generations are coming out more and more, and I’m happy for people who can be out without a lot of familial backlash! But like you said, I really do think that a lot of people don’t really know what it’s like to grow up in a totally homophobic environment. Obviously we all deal with homophobia or transphobia to a degree, but it’s isolating when people’s ability to be out and open prevents them from having recognition of—or empathy for—the struggles that a lot of us continue to face from loved ones and/or less accepting communities.

Thanks for your advice and sharing your thoughts. Wishing you all the best!"

And yeah, that’s what’s held me back the most, I think. I really don’t know how they’ll respond, and I don’t feel prepared for things to go poorly. I feel like I’m constantly trying to weigh the emotional/psychological risk of remaining closeted to them vs. the risk of coming out and facing backlash. So far, the possibility of backlash seems worse.

exLutheran,fdhgccq,t3_egmvfp,1578422052.0,"Yes, hearing other ex-Lutherans’ experiences has been really validating! I grew up LCMS and I think Lutheranism is weird for sure, lol. 

What really sets it apart for me when I hear about other Christian denominations is how Lutheranism manages to be both so repressed and yet so...vocally bigoted? I don’t know quite how to describe it, but I think that often people’s image of conservative evangelicals is like, Westboro or Southern Baptist megachurches or gun-toting “rednecks” something. Yet LCMS and WELS hold a lot of the same bigoted social beliefs. But Lutherans (or at least LCMS members) like to think of themselves as these kind of reserved salt-of-the-earth types, at least in my experience. I remember always hearing jokes about how “Lutherans all sit in the back pew,” and “You won’t see us dancing around and clapping our hands at church!” 

But at the end of the day, just because they don’t have preachers spitting hellfire on some Christian TV channel and they aren’t generally out protesting things in the streets, LCMS and WELS Lutherans are no less sexist and homophobic (and in many cases, I think racist and classist too) as any other evangelical. 

Another thing is just how guilt-trippy Lutheranism is. You can’t tell me having to recite “I a poor miserable sinner confess unto thee all my sins and iniquities with which I have ever offended thee and justly deserved thy present and eternal punishment” in church every week didn’t do a number on all of us psychologically, lol."

I never saw Bible Man but I got a good laugh out of it when I looked it up. 

We also watched a lot of episodes of something called “The Greatest Adventure: Stories from the Bible,” about kids who go back in time and see different events from the Bible taking place. Which only stands out to me because it was produced by Hanna-Barbera, the same company that made Scooby Doo, The Flintstones, and a bunch of other similar stuff. And I always thought as a kid that it was weird they were making this cheesy Bible show too."
actuallesbians,fdevuv1,t3_efodyc,1578347673.0,"It’s pretty queer! I’ve lived in a couple other large cities in the Midwest, and while the number of LGBTQ people you see is always dependent on the neighborhood you’re in and what events are going on, in general I see way more LGBTQ people (or presumably LGBTQ people) here than I have elsewhere.

There’s an event called Flannel Fridays the first Friday of every month, which is a queer women-focused dance party. I only went once but it was fun! There are a few places around Andersonville that have a lot of queer women, including Joie de Vine, which is lesbian owned. I know Farragut’s has a lesbian night (never been) and Spyner’s in Lincoln Square is a karaoke dive that’s like...unofficially a lesbian bar, to my understanding (whenever I’ve been there it’s felt like a mix of random people, lesbians, and other LGBTQ people).

I live in Edgewater and recently read that my zip code has had the highest number of same-sex marriages since gay marriage was legalized, which is pretty cool. Andersonville and Boystown are the main gayborhoods—I’m not super familiar with too much of the south side but I know that some bars and organizations exist throughout those neighborhoods too. And honestly you’ll see queer people around most of the north side.

In rereading your question I realized you asked about non-club oriented activities so I would say also join the Chicago Queer Exchange and Chicagostraddlers (reference to Autostraddle) Facebook groups—people post about events and groups in those a lot too. I’m still in the process of meeting people here and I’m not the best at getting out and being a part of communities, including LGBTQ communities, but they’re definitely here if you look for them!

Good luck :)"

I remember my school and church always talking about the secular world and how sinful it is and how as Christians (or sometimes as Lutherans specifically) we were supposedly set apart by our beliefs, so it's not too surprising that someone might get caught up in that mindset. Still disappointing though.

I went to an LCMS school from kindergarten through 8th grade, and then thankfully switched to public school for high school. I met one of my best friends there but otherwise have no contact with anyone I met in school there. It left me with some entertaining stories, but also a decent amount of internalized homophobia and misogyny to unpack down the road."
exLutheran,f41zvqx,t1_f41rjfd,1571325818.0,"Thanks for sharing! I think the experience of thinking you’re asexual before realizing you’re a lesbian is a pretty common one.

I remember making arguments like “gay marriage is a slippery slope” as a younger teenager despite regularly having fantasies about like, kissing my female best friend, lol. Sorry to hear about your family, but it’s really great that you’re looking out for your cousins—I think a lot of us would have had an easier time if we had a supportive family member to turn to."
exLutheran,f4065yw,t3_dbrhdt,1571286376.0,"Definitely, although my shifting political views were also a big part of my leaving Lutheranism. I went to an LCMS K-8 school where nearly everyone was really conservative (I remember having school mock elections during the 2008 presidential race--the result was something like 400 votes for McCain, 40 for Obama, and 5 for Donald Duck) and most of my family is pretty conservative as well, including my parents. Then I went to a public high school and became more socially liberal over time, which definitely drove me to question Lutheranism a lot more. I got to a point where I was still loosely Christian but also very supportive of gay rights and moderately pro-choice...obviously lots of Christians are socially liberal, but for me being socially conservative was so tied up with my religious experience that my religious and political beliefs sort of unraveled in tandem with each other. I always felt a little iffy about the teachings related to gender, which led me to question Lutheranism, and questioning/leaving Lutheranism allowed me to fully embrace feminism--it was sort of cyclical. I also pretty much repressed the realization that I was queer until I was relatively safely detached from the church and not living with my Lutheran parents, and that realization has been a big part of shaping my political beliefs as well.

I never really officially left Lutheranism, just stopped being involved when I moved away for college and my parents couldn't make me go to church anymore. At that point I was a moderate liberal, and then my politics moved way further left when I started school. At this point I would just call myself a leftist without a specific label, which is...definitely not congruent with the teachings of the the LCMS, lol."
exLutheran,f404k4k,t1_f3zz1mg,1571284850.0,"Hey, fellow ex-LCMS here! Sorry that happened to you, but I'm glad you seem to be in a better place."
exLutheran,f404en7,t1_f40384p,1571284713.0,"Thanks for your insight, this is an interesting perspective. Like you said, LCMS is definitely a different experience. I've never really had any close contact with more queer friendly forms of religion (or maybe that should be ""queer friendly"" in quotations) because I was raised LCMS and then dropped out of religion entirely. 

But from my (admittedly outside) perspective, one thing that makes me question more liberal denominations' stances on LGBT issues is that it often seems that, sort of like you said, it feels more like tokenizing, or like LGBT people still have to fit within certain constraints. In some cases, it feels like liberal Christians are more concerned with convincing people that they're LGBT friendly than they are with truly reconciling their own faith with the reality of Christian homophobia both historically and currently. Rather than trying to convince others (and especially LGBT people) that ""a lot of Christians are actually progressive!""/""bigoted people aren't *true* Christians!"", etc. I would rather have these progressive Christians put in the work of 1) Listening to Christian/ex-Christian LGBT people who have been hurt by homophobia/transphobia, and 2) Calling out other Christians who are homophobic/transphobic.

I think this is a slightly different point than the one you're making, but overall I think it's all part of this larger culture of sort of accepting people on the surface rather than truly fully accepting them as they are.  I don't think any denomination, including so-called progressive ones, can really call themselves accepting until they grapple with the bigotry that is still very prominent in much of Christianity, as well as learn to accept LGBT people that don't fit into the narrow and still relatively conservative constraints that they're comfortable with."
Anxiety,f4038qe,t3_dil99z,1571283683.0,"Yeah, I feel that. I think part of it is that we're more likely to get anxious about things and over-analyze them when we don't have ongoing validation or positive feedback. So like, as long as you're continuing to hang out with the person after an interaction you worry is embarrassing, I think it's easier to be reminded that they do still like you and want to hang out with you and probably aren't thinking ""this person is a weird embarrassing loser."" But once more time has gone by and you don't have that reassurance in the form of continued interaction with them, it's easier to start worrying that maybe you really *did* do something embarrassing and they noticed. It's like unless I'm there in the moment having an enjoyable interaction with them and receiving the validation/positive feedback/whatever you want to call it of them actively continuing to engage with me, there's always the risk that the anxiety will start creeping back in."
exLutheran,f3zl52d,t3_d2afv8,1571271553.0,"Nothing at all. I suppose agnostic would be the closest label, but I think what was really liberating for me when I stopped believing was realizing that I didn’t have to define myself in relation to religion at all."
exLutheran,f3zkkag,t3_d75c2i,1571271183.0,"I did definitely believe it at some point, although I think I always had some questions. By middle school I remember periodically having anxiety about whether or not God was real, especially laying in bed at night. Then freshman year of high school, when I started at a public school after going to an LCMS school my whole life, I had kind of a freak out where I started questioning it all again and asking my parents how they knew it was real. They bought me a bunch of “How to know God is real”-type books (lmao) and I got over it, but within a couple years I was pretty solidly agnostic, although I think I still loosely called myself a Christian more because I was afraid of the concept of hell. I knew that it all sounded kind of wacky and impossible but actually taking the plunge and admitting that I really didn’t believe in it was intimidating. I think first I started questioning the morals of the Lutheran church after I became more socially liberal, and then that turned into me questioning the logic of it all, and I’d say I considered myself agnostic by the time I started college around 6 years ago."
Anxiety,f33it0s,t1_f323jat,1570639375.0,"Yeah, your point about control is very real. Actually, it kind of made something click for me—I guess I’ve known that not being able to control things freaks me out, but I can never understand why having to accomplish tasks freaks me out too. But you’re right that not being able to control the fact that I have to do it is probably what causes it! Now to figure out how to deal with that, lol."
Anxiety,f18lpmw,t3_d7vxit,1569259785.0,"Ugh, yeah, I feel this. It’s like the only way I can get myself to totally relax and avoid this feeling is to just decide “fuck it” and not try to be productive at *all*—which is okay sometimes, but also prevents me from doing things I want to do and moving forward. But once I start to take productive steps, I feel overwhelmed, like I have to do it all right now. 

Anyways, obviously it’s something I struggle with a lot but one thing I’ve found helpful for myself is setting aside time to essentially do nothing, or to do whatever I want. Like if it’s a weekend afternoon and I’ve had that nagging “do something productive” feeling all day, I’ll try to consciously decide that I’m going to just take a break and do whatever I want for the rest of the day, and that my productive Anxiety Brain can take over again the next day.

Rationally I know that if I were at home I probably wouldn’t have to go for several hours at a time, but as soon as I’m in a place where I’m worried that I can’t access one easily, I’m immediately like “oh no what if I have to go again 30 minutes from now and I can’t!” 

It’s the worst."

Is that what most artists do? To me it makes it seem more like she’s kept at making music because it’s something she’s genuinely passionate about. 

Also, are we criticizing every artist that sets out with the goal of being successful now? Because if that’s the case, the “artistry is ruined” for most of the industry."

Anxiety,eqbq1wr,t3_by1p8h,1559953349.0,"I use a virtual one! It’s actually just an account on a blogging website, set to maximum privacy. I made it 10 years ago as a 14 year old living with my parents because I was afraid they would see it if it was a physical journal or would find the files on the computer if I did it on Word. I’ve been meaning to find another platform for it and just haven’t yet.

Personally, I like having it on the computer because I can access it anywhere, without having to carry a physical journal with me. And honestly, I’m a lot more likely to actually write stuff when I can just type it. I’ve always loved the idea of a physical journal and have tried it a few times over the years, but I never stick with it, I think because I can type faster than I can write and because in a way, it’s less intimidating—I always feel like my thoughts have to be more formulated when I’m physically writing them down, but with a virtual journal it’s just stream of consciousness for me."

Anxiety,epid1ku,t3_buvtic,1559237421.0,"I completely get the fear of them reaching out to you because you’re a last resort, but honestly there’s a really good chance that their plans just changed—they found space in the budget, someone else left, etc. Obviously if they reached out to you, they must like you! I don’t know what your job is but it’s usually not too hard to find people to fill a summer job, so I’m sure they could have found someone else if they really wanted to.

I would say take it—who knows what’s changed since last summer? You could be working with different people or you might just get along better with the same coworkers this year. And if it doesn’t work out, you can always leave, but at least you will have made a little extra money first."
