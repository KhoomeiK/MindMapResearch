My step-kid's dad is spending their inheritance, once they are old enough to understand, they will know this and I will advise them that he can and should be covering their needs/wants. I already gave them a home and cover childcare cost. I give no fucks that they know, he's damaging them already worth bad parenting. They need to know how shitty he is eventually, so sooner the better."

Happiness is very fleeting, so when I have it, I learned to appreciate it. The thought of my parents passing haunts me; they're my only real friends. I may decide to check out when they do. Nothing keeping here then."

Maine,esv1af4,t1_esuzwk7,1562292203.0,"Begrudgingly, Bowdoin is in a nicer area than Colby College. Waterville is a crap hole but it's improving (finally). Colby College pays no taxes and has a annual Endowment in the millions, so of course the area stayed stagnate, also they discriminate against older non-tenure people and force them out. So fuck them.

You'd like southern Maine more anyways. I live in Brunswick now, and the area is very accessible to surrounding nature trails."
