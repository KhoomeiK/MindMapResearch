StopSelfHarm,flt3omh,t3_fqyldm,1585458286.0,I have tips on hiding scars but I'm still struggling with sh myself. What I do is I use this stuff called scar wax to hide the raised scars. A thin layer evens everything out. Scar wax can be made with petroleum jelly and flour easily. Then you can either put foundation and concealer in the wax itself or on top of it. It works pretty well for me. I wouldn't recommend going into the water with it on just in case.
StopSelfHarm,flq1cd2,t3_fqe3us,1585375406.0,I was like that for a while too. Except on my arms. I told my girlfriend about it and talking it out really helps. I hope you get to point where you aren't as anxious. ❤
