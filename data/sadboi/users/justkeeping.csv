It doesn’t really matter at all, except what you make it matter. 

There should be some relief in that. 

Don’t try and solve all the problems, don’t fixate on paradoxes, usually the simplest answer is the right answer. 

I believe people post here to make themselves feel a little better, and that’s okay."

That being said I think some break down of your thought processes around this would be beneficial. That way you’re not cognitively operating in the dark. I recommend some self esteem reshaping work. Evaluate your self beliefs and where they come from and you’ll get a better idea of how to move forward.

insomnia,eznp85q,t3_d1gn0j,1568009377.0,"You seem filled with anxiety. This sort of dread used to be common place in my life. Especially at night. During the day I’d keep it at bay with activities and the moment I’d slow down, it was like a flooding of memories. Emdr therapy was really helpful for me. Guided Meditations for sleep have also been very helpful. But ultimately, don’t stifle these feelings and fears, take time with a journal and quiet space, jot them down, then make a list of tangible, actionable items for each of them. You may find the fear to be irrational, the only action item is to let them go. Others you’ll have steps to do. Like laying out your clothes the night before so you don’t feel as rushed in the morning. Slowly you can chip away at this. You don’t need to do it alone. See a doctor. See a couple of doctors. I’ve been working at this for years. I have manic phases when I just sleep less. I have depressive episodes where I can do next to nothing but sleep. Life presents opportunities for growth often in unpleasant ways initially. If you learn to start being attentive to it, and you begin allocating time and energy and resources to handling it, you will have progress. At this moment I know it feels like a regression, but it’s just another step along the way."

I’d shut the doors terrified before I sleep still I’d see them open in SP. So I started telling myself she was really just obsessed with picking the right outfit. I’d visualize her laying out options on the bed and having conversations with herself about what would look good but she’d never settle on anything. Eventually I was able to translate that to every time she’d pop up. Now when I get SP which is rare since I changed to a firmer pilllow, there’s nothing intimidating.
