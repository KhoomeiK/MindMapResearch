SuicideWatch,f2v0ebd,t3_def9c4,1570438998.0,I'm fine with the universe winning at this point. Maybe it can throw me a terminal illness.
SuicideWatch,f1hsrq5,t1_f1hsp0h,1569500265.0,I can't drive.
SuicideWatch,f1hgsjv,t1_f1hdtze,1569493148.0,I never had those things so I can't relate.
SuicideWatch,f1hdgy2,t1_f1hd3bd,1569491071.0,"I never had anything and never felt any motivation to change since I started my dead end job 15 years ago. I know I'm supposed to fix this and no one else is, but frankly, I don't want to. I'm sat at home now and could do something productive, but will I? No. 

My life is going to hell and it's my fault so I want a decent escape before shit really gets worse."
SuicideWatch,f1hck3w,t1_f1hc457,1569490511.0,"This is why I think suicidal people should have the right to a peaceful death through euthanasia. It's disgusting that in this day in age that suicidal people are neglected and forced to take matters into their own hands. If our purpose is to kill ourselves for the greater good, we should have a peaceful way to exit life when we choose."
SuicideWatch,f1ezcm5,t1_f1ez6mz,1569433673.0,I've just started smoking a lot more in the past 6 months to try and get cancer myself. Doubt it will happen anytime soon though so I need a decent suicide method I can successfully follow through with.
SuicideWatch,f1ey6i6,t1_f1eww4c,1569432927.0,I wish I could trade places with my mum. She has cancer and doesn't want it and I just want to die.
SuicideWatch,f1ey1ud,t1_f1evuhz,1569432843.0,"Don't agree with that at all. Plenty of babies and kids born into agony living short lives before their deaths and adults who never find their purpose and kill themselves or just die naturally. All these people show me is that some of us weren't born for our lives to have meaning. 

I'm so far gone that I'm just a brain dead cunt that thinks of nothing but suicide ALL THE TIME. What is the point in living when that's life?"
SuicideWatch,f1dxw1h,t3_d8vrfj,1569405005.0,"Over the course of 12 years I went as far as I could possibly go. I have been assessed at one place 6 times and then just left high and dry. I've visited my doctor countless times, tried meds, CBT etc. For me, there is no cure. It's left me feeling worse knowing that there is no hope for me."
SuicideWatch,f1dxr3m,t3_d8vrq3,1569404818.0,"I'm in my 30's and everything is the same. Couldn't relate to the ""you enjoy work"" part though."
SuicideWatch,f1dw0j1,t1_f1d0aaq,1569402347.0,Whatever else women want doesn't matter any way. It still isn't me.
SuicideWatch,f1cjx5d,t1_f1cjb5t,1569359123.0,"I've dated many girls from different walks of life and it's always been the same. Since I got older they want someone who has their shit together at my age, and I don't. I completely understand it. There's no point having a relationship with someone who is financially unstable because it can't be sustained. I just have no motivation to do anything because I'm useless, don't know what I want and I'm a lazy bastard.

I'm also incapable of satisfying women sexually due to my small dick and not being able to last long. This is just a message my ex sent me after she said I never satisfied her when I asked why she was ignoring me:  

""Fuck you and there is nothing to tell you anymore. I’ve dated with quite many guys. But you’re the worst guy in my life with your heart and dick"".

Literally all the women I know want security and/or good sex. Finding one that doesn't is like looking for a unicorn. I wouldn't be deserving of them anyway."
SuicideWatch,f1cbcrw,t1_f1cb970,1569354015.0,"From my experience they do. I'm not blaming them for it, I'm just saying I can't satisfy them if that's what they want."
SuicideWatch,f1caw5d,t1_f1cam0x,1569353734.0,I'm not blaming women. I understand why they don't want me. I'm blaming myself.
SuicideWatch,f1bt7j7,t1_f1bsli4,1569342429.0,All the different types I've met really aren't interested. They all fundamentally want sex and security from what I've seen. At least one or the other. I have nothing to offer.
SuicideWatch,f1bdgsp,t1_f1bcu2d,1569331736.0,That's one of the reasons why I'm contemplating suicide. I don't want to work.
SuicideWatch,f1bcqic,t1_f1bcnxz,1569331163.0,"Because I'm going to be working until I drop with no money since I have no talent, motivation or skills."
