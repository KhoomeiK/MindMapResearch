BPD,fnyc1s4,t3_fxrx53,1587358761.0,"Just a random correlation: i usually ghost people to test whether they care enough to reach out or even notice if I did. 

For me, it's incredibly difficult to get close to people but when ai do, I jump to the block button and regret it later. 

I usually can't commit to the ghosting and it's usually made on impulsive. 

All this being said, if someone is toxic to your well-being, keep doing what you are doing and take care of you. Be careful it's not a rash decision to avoid pushing past the discomfort to having a genuine friend or SO. 

Much love üíö"

I can't tell you what to do: it's difficult because your decisions after a traumatic experience are, 1) yours to make, 2) almost undoubtedly going to be motivated by the perpetrator. 

Personally I would want a noticeable distance from that person, and although church is a place in which acceptance and openness is appreciated, I would not want to worship in an environment in which that would be condoned. Personally, if you brought it to a leader, the safety of their members is their responsibility. They don't take that seriously, take it to the next person in charge. 

If it's not a motivation of their leader's, move on. I've seen it go bad and end in more powerlessness and a court case. Leaving is within your control and your life and safety is yours to protect. This sounds like more than discomfort, we are not just hyper sensitive, we are educated on what does go wrong. That internal voice is there for a reason."

Issue the alert and state an apology later if your suspicion is confirmed. You cannot seek justice while making your own decision to allow a young girl be sexually assaulted and killed. 

I hope those ""personal reasons"" come with some sleepless nights of regret and remorse for the pain you allowed someone to inflict on a child through your negligence."
