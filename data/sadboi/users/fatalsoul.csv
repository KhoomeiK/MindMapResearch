- Companies that own the GMO patent are often very predatory (Monsanto is a great example)
- Increased yields from GMO crops can, ironically, put poorer small farmers out of business. These newer crops often require more up-front cost for water and fertilizers to be able to reach that increased yield.
- Crops that are more resistant to herbicide / insecticide can encourage higher usage of these chemicals, which are hard to filter from waterways.
- The only hypothetical that I can understand from a health point is that GMO foods may be simply better from a commercial perspective (looks pretty / longer shelf life) but may have the possibility of being worse from a nutrient perspective (more sugary apples)."

Trans women believe they're women too. I'll posit that promotes trans women's perspectives; they don't see themselves as ""appropriating"" periods if they believe they ""have"" periods.

So, how could any policy ever be implemented that may ever ""ban"" trans people from the bathroom they ""identify"" with?

How do you know -- beyond any matter of a doubt -- that, that woman is trans? Has she told you?"

This is to avoid what I call sidelining the argument: I've noticed a lot of ""new arguments"" being brought up instead of actual thoughtful replies, thus ""smoke-screening"" the issue with further detritus."

This sub ""[hugboxes](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hugbox)"" - I'm not saying this is particularly bad for them, but I consider it a bit toxic.

All of that aside:

How would *you* know *for sure* she's a woman *if she looks like a man*?

This is the opposite of passing, yet it is a given that this natal woman who ""looks like a man"" ought to be able to use the ladies' room.

Language is descriptive.

Using ""cis"" is far shorter than typing or saying ""person who is not transgender"". ""Cis"" is a root meaning ""the same side of"".

If the most common car color is ""silver"" I might, nonetheless, describe a car as ""silver"" for specificity.

>...CIS? It's not real.

Whether or not you ""agree"" it's real, it's still a term. ""Faerie"" is a term. Just because ""Faeries"" aren't real, don't mean they don't have a connotation and definition in most cases. It doesn't mean we don't use this word in a conversation."
