This is an extremley situational and subjective argument. Think about it, if your daughter was dating some hippie stoner who happens to be white would you introduce him to your parent as the mother and father? Probably not. But if he was a black man who was doing the same things you wouldnt either, and that is not racist. It's called protecting your families interests in their grand daughters future. Now if we are going to gauge who he is as a human being, we need more details about him, then the community can decide if your call is or is not racist or is completley justified based off who he is."
