airbnb_hosts,eu2zvw0,t3_cej9sd,1563401983.0,"Location location location, the biggest factor. Let's say both the house and the condo have the same layout and sq. footage. 

The house has a yard! The condo has shared out door space, maybe a deck. 

The house can accommodate more than one car parked off the street,the condo maybe not. 

The house has more separation from immediate neighbors, so noise is less of an issue. 


The condo, you don't get to chose who lives on the other side of the common wall, and maybe your guests disturb them,or maybe they disturb your guests because they got a stick up their ass that you are renting it out short term

Everything made of metal rusts before its time, all wood rots, things kept closed up in dressers or closets mildew, many homes have no heating, and no air-conditioning, many places are not kept up. Hilo is charming and wonderful but having a house there well, everything rots in the jungle. Termites eat everything. Formosa termites even eat through concrete.

AirBnB,etxoykt,t1_etxnm6m,1563304139.0,"The law will allow management companies like they do now, I don't think that will change. What may change is more fees, permits, and inspections.

The amount of time per year you are allowed to have a short term rental will probably change. If you rent and are found in violation your insurance can deny any claim, you could be liable for damages your illegal guests caused and you homeowners insurance will tell you to pound sand.

And they may ban them outright. So if your ability to pay the mortgage depends on the rental income, this might not be a good idea. 

You can still buy a condo, but you might not be able to just pick up and go stay without planning. Like I said, most condos already have management in place."
AirBnB,etxnvl8,t1_etwzzus,1563303445.0,"A condo might not be the best way to go. You will need a property management company to take care of the rental and most condo communities already have one in place. I know people sneak in and do this anyway but the condo board can Levy fines for not following the rules. 

You need a stand alone fee simple property. However those are often in HOA communities that have rules you must follow. Some don't allow more than six months out of the year to short term stays etc. 

Like I said before I lived in Hawaii for a very long time. 


My mother still lives there and the fight over long-term vs short term rentals is heating up. 

Having a rental requires some management and paying for cleaning  and fixing broken things etc. People vacation in Hawaii to party or do the once in a lifetime destination wedding event etc.and can be rough on rentals.

I am new to Airbnb but not new to property management."

Many folks book a Hawaiian vacation a year out, so having a condo like this might not work for you if you don't have set times you go. Many won't allow Airbnb. The HOA the runs the condo community or property owners association will let you know what you can and cannot do."
