depression,fism817,t3_f9kaou,1582687688.0,"Even if you didn't have depression issues, I think its fine to hire a cleaning service. If I could afford it, I would do it."
depression,filcqg2,t3_f8cifm,1582498633.0,"In the US, you get thrown in the hospital against your will, held for 3 days to 2 weeks and then get shoved back out without any actual treatment. Oh and you pay like $10,000 for the privilege."
insanepeoplefacebook,filciro,t3_f8aoj9,1582498493.0,My baby was born at 30 weeks and he didn't even look that well formed.
depression,fgv9b9s,t3_f0exjf,1581141195.0,Happened to me a few years ago. I have met some new friends since but only like 2. It sucks how much people don't care about you when you have a mental illness. It also happened when I had pregnancy complications and my baby was in the hospital. People just faded away.
depression,fgv940n,t3_f0h2t0,1581140995.0,I lost my dog of 17 years 2 years ago and I still miss him. Dogs love you in a way no one else ever will. I'm so sorry you are losing him. I know it sucks so bad.
depression,fgv8w4g,t3_f0j19u,1581140782.0,My best friend did this to me when I was about 13. It sucks so bad. There isn't much else I can say. It sucks. Try to make it until you can get out of your house and away from your parents. It will be better on your own.
depression,ffvv78c,t3_evhpsp,1580274229.0,"Help take care of her and the little things in life that you can. I'm not sure how old you are, but if she has an apartment, clean it for her. Or do her laundry. Make sure she has decent meals to eat. If you are younger, maybe help her get her homework done. Just make sure that the little things in life get done and aren't overwhelming her. It won't cure her or anything, but it will help her get through it to the other side."
depression,ffvuy5h,t3_evgkkn,1580274010.0,"Took me a couple tries to find someone. A lot of them have websites for the practice and will have a little blurb about them. You can see a little about them and what kind of therapy they use. You can also see a picture. I prefer someone younger so a picture helps. If you see someone and think ""boy do I find this person annoying,"" try someone else. No point wasting time on someone you don't click with."
depression,ffvujys,t1_ffvpx99,1580273674.0,Something similar happened to me minus the handcuffs. You go for help and you get treated like a fucking criminal.
depression,ffvuhpv,t3_evfi4g,1580273621.0,"Yeah I spent 4 weeks in the hospital for pregnancy complications and my baby spent 7 weeks in the NICU. I paid $13,000 and it would have been over $300,000 without insurance. Spent every penny we had saved for a down payment on a house."
depression,ffvuagg,t3_eva63z,1580273452.0,"That's good. Took me a while to find someone I liked and had a rough time ""unzipping"" my issues for the first time. Glad it went for you the first time."
depression,ffvu5kj,t1_ffppc8q,1580273341.0,"Oh I definitely have postpartum depression, but I also have regular depression. I have my whole life. I've been on pills for years, but I'm on a max dose of antidepressants and antianxiety so I would have to change medications and I don't exactly have the time to have a mental breakdown changing meds right now. The best thing in my life is my job and I don't intend to lose it and I can't act professional while having a breakdown. My husband only talks to me some and has refused to see a counselor or doctor."
depression,ffqo30q,t1_ffprlg9,1580139642.0,Oh it might be better than. it's fucked up in the US. Your stuff might be better. I would still bring books though.
depression,ffpnego,t3_euib6s,1580099464.0,I know how you feel. I have been thinking about starting self harming again. I can't tell my therapist because I don't want to get pulled out of work and potentially lose my job. I don't want to tell my husband because he will worry and start hovering and taking away my freedom.
depression,ffpn8dm,t3_euiga7,1580099327.0,"It isn't much fun, but try to rest and laugh when you can. Bring books and get some reading done. You will need to pass the time. And don't be afraid to speak up and advocate for yourself. You have rights as a patient. If you think something is fucked up, demand to see a patient advocate. You might not need to, but I think anyone staying in a hospital for any reason should know their rights."
depression,ffpmvge,t3_euimqh,1580099041.0,"I have the same problem. I started listening to podcasts, audio books, or TV shows about 10 years ago and it helps a lot."
depression,ffpmk7n,t3_eug7xu,1580098792.0,"I enjoy being an adult more than being a kid. Depression still sucks really bad, but it did get better."
depression,ffpkj3j,t3_eui69t,1580097271.0,"I haven't had all of your symptoms, but have had some. Pills helped me a lot. It took me a long time to find the right ones though. Maybe like 6 months or something."
depression,ffpk7jq,t3_eudwtm,1580097037.0,"I was in a terrible accident when I was 18 and walked away without a scratch. I think all the time about how I should have died that day. I was hospitalized earlier this year with serious pregnancy complications. I keep thinking about how even 60 years ago, I would have died."
depression,ff52lnm,t3_ern9vk,1579578523.0,Did some good for me. I had to try a few before I found something that helped though.

depression,ff52a10,t3_erougv,1579578278.0,"I have spent a lot of my life self-harming so maybe me saying something is being a hypocrite, but it's probably best to try and head it off before it gets too out of hand. It can get away from you really fast."

depression,ff51rfj,t3_ermkdi,1579577886.0,"I got sent to a hospital for admitting it too. It didn't help me. It just traumatized me for months. I wish I had better advice. Sometimes my depression isn't so bad with a lot of drugs and therapy. It took years to get there though. And I don't tell anyone what I feel like anymore because when I did, all my friends left after the hospital didn't cure me and I didn't get better in the time frame they wanted. It is a lonely life always keeping it inside though. You can't really be close to anyone."
depression,ff29m7u,t3_er86vu,1579497894.0,I'm sorry about your dog. Dogs love us more than other humans ever could. I lost my dog 2 years ago. He literally saved my life when I attempted suicide. You will always hold that dog in your heart.

depression,ff298r5,t3_er57i8,1579497562.0,One time a psychiatrist would see me because I had been hospitalized before. I cussed out the receptionist. It made me feel a lot better.
depression,ff293rs,t3_er79p8,1579497433.0,"Whatever you do, dont tell your therapist you cut. I made that mistake and they locked me away for 3 days. It was traumatizing. I'm sorry I don't have better advice. The mental healthcare system in this country is seriously fucked."

depression,fe67nt1,t1_fe5rjr7,1578883614.0,Same. You have to look at the scars forever and it sucks. I'm 31 and I still have scars from 15+ years ago.

depression,fdtffrx,t3_emtjyn,1578715993.0,"I give the same advice to everyone about therapy. You won't make progress unless it is someone you genuinely like. There are lot of different therapists with different personalities and techniques. If one isn't working, try another. I think I saw 3 before I found one that actually helped. Also, I don't know where you live, but my therapist is only $100/hr."
SuicideWatch,fdtah3s,t3_elj38e,1578714037.0,Your parents are the ones who are fucking awful and terrible. You sound young. Life gets so much better as an adult. I moved out at 18 and I haven't looked back.
