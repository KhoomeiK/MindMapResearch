The former is clearly the superior way to handle it. Off of the top of my head, Rock Valley Garden Center and Pig Minds Brewing Company both have implemented similar, effective systems. Woodman's is basically a free for all, even the Wal-Mart by Bell School has a minimal and better system than they do."

Every jail inmate deserves the opportunity to be healthy, safe, and to re-enter society. Right now, the conditions at the jail are abysmal. There was a significant article in the RRStar (can't find it, if anyone can) detailing its awful conditions and lack of available resources. You keep talking about your own problems instead of taking a moment to consider institutional and systemic issues. Rockford is notorious for failing public institutions such as the justice system and the public school system. I guess that you don't really think about anyone other than yourself."
