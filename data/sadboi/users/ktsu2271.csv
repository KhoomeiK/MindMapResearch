SuicideWatch,fd0pndr,t3_eieayu,1578122071.0,"Yeah. Well part of me does. The part of me that feels hopeless. Like I have no purpose. Like I don't contribute anything of value to society. I feel incapable of holding a conversation of substance. I don't know how to interact with people without feeling awkward. I don't know how to have fun anymore. I can't maintain meaningful relationships. I feel like I'm not a good friend, sister, daughter, girlfriend, aunt, etc. I've lost interest in the things I once used to be so passionate about. I work a dead-end job that barely pays the bills. I dropped out of grad school, something I've been working toward for the past 10 years, which just makes me feel worse b/c I see myself as a quitter, like I've wasted the past 10 years of my life pursuing something that I ended up giving up on and I've lost all sense of direction in my life.

But there is a part of me that still has a tiny shred of hope. And I guess it's that small part that keeps me going.

Reading through this thread did help in that it made me feel as if I'm not completely alone and isolated."
