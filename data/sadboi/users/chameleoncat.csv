13WeekWeightLoss,f2w4vtp,t3_dek0f0,1570461332.0,I cheated a little this weekend but I’m back to 100 today. There is an event my family goes to every year and it’s the only time of year it happens so I made a compromise on Saturday to enjoy a beer and small portions of potatoes (in addition to other foods that are Keto friendly). I had a good time and didn’t overdo it. However Sunday was also like 80% good and then blew it for dinner. Oh well! Such is life. Back on it today and excited. I did manage to lose 3 lbs since I started last week so I’m in a good spot about it.
bipolar2,f2w2fod,t1_f2vwmld,1570460456.0,This I agree with $$$
bipolar2,f2w1z0q,t1_f2o7z1q,1570460279.0,Appreciate your honesty!
bipolar2,f2w1vx0,t3_ddnlwx,1570460247.0,Thank you :)
bipolar2,f2w1u25,t1_f2o9uy1,1570460228.0,I still haven’t had this convo yet but I am curious of the same. If I were to guess it’s because he felt he needed to do something and wasn’t sure what else.
bipolar2,f2w1gz9,t1_f2oxkz1,1570460093.0,I appreciate your response. Thank you! Just trying to keep going on all of the above. I have some exciting leads right now so I’m hoping sooner rather than later.

bipolar2,f2nrw0f,t1_f2mhqgo,1570319109.0,I didn’t know what HFA was so I looked it up. He’s not diagnosed HFA but honestly I’ve been thinking wondering if he is on the spectrum somewhere. Thank you for your response
bipolar2,f2nqus9,t1_f2nq7ht,1570318856.0,Thank you!! I will look into it :)
bipolar2,f2nqn5k,t1_f2l3khc,1570318787.0,"After we got done arguing it turned to this, he realized I was in pain and was comforting me. I think I need to keep him in the loop more about what’s happening in the present and get support then and there. I bottle up too much :/"
bipolar2,f2npyov,t1_f2ne5o9,1570318642.0,"Need to get back into therapy, for sure. We talked about this when I was in therapy and he’s open although still kinda freaked out about it. The stigma of therapy and meds and mental health is something I’m working on too..."
bipolar2,f2nprya,t1_f2mhqgo,1570318575.0,"This 100%. He tries to help by giving an answer but there’s no answer in my opinion. I just need to be heard. We’re going to work on this, hopefully. I said I’d rather have him ask me questions than tell me an answer."
bipolar2,f2npi84,t1_f2lib3r,1570318484.0,"Nope, neither of us have called. I am not suicidal, but I do have thoughts. I’m still actively looking for work and in general living a good life. The thoughts are intrusive and fleeting. I don’t think he gets that? If I called the hotline I’m not even sure what I’d get out of that short of them saying go to a hospital ? To which I get there and they’re like ok you’re fine ? We have not yet talked about his response but I think that is due soon"
bipolar2,f2nozla,t1_f2muxm0,1570318310.0,I need to have this talk. The problem is I hardly even know what I can let him know to look for. He wants to be supportive and is doing so how he knows how but it’s not what I need. Through this conversation although I was disappointed I did tell him a couple new things that I think would help support me. Asking questions rather than giving an answer. I’ll continue to work on this. He can’t read my mind
bipolar2,f2nok00,t1_f2m9nz6,1570318192.0,"Thank you so much, I cried a little reading this! You get the feels for sure"
bipolar2,f2no3d6,t1_f2nip3v,1570318075.0,Thank you for this. A blanket statement isn’t a good answer for me bc there isn’t one. I’m prone to internalizing rather than vocalizing so that’s a task to work on
bipolar2,f2nnvjp,t1_f2m9g99,1570318001.0,Totally! He really does try. So it’s frustrating for us both. It’s going to take more work and I need to be more clear about what I need
bipolar2,f2nnq8t,t1_f2ltrkk,1570317952.0,I really appreciate your response and it resonates a lot with me
bipolar2,f2nnc4o,t1_f2kwpnv,1570317896.0,"Yes, and I need to be more clear about what I need. He doesn’t know. I barely know! I’m going to try to be more clear about what support means to me"
bipolar2,f2nn4on,t1_f2lfopg,1570317840.0,Definitely a possibility :/
bipolar2,f2nn1ta,t1_f2lr58t,1570317812.0,"He definitely didn’t know :( we’ve been together 5 years and I only got my diagnosis last year. I also do really well at masking things until things are serious like we live together or spending a lot of time together. It’s new territory for both of us. Unfortunately this is now the third relationship where this pattern is happening so I do think a lot of it has to do with me. Also a huge possibility it’s not a good fit and he and I do discuss that, it’s hard."

13WeekWeightLoss,f2ilko3,t1_f2fvyj0,1570258978.0,"I made it! It’s pretty easy. Curry powder, mayo, salt pep are the mains. I added additional spices for fun- garlic powder, coriander, Garam masala-  and a little mustard. Celery and onion sliced thin are good in it too."
13WeekWeightLoss,f2fswqm,t3_dd69rr,1570222227.0,"Every time I have a craving I tel myself to drink water first and I start an activity like cleaning or a project that will take me at least 30-60 mins. I tell myself if I’m still “hungry” I can have a healthy snack. Usually I’m not though! 

For me meal prepping and planning my meals on myfitnesspal helps a lot. It’s distracting and engaging and also reminds me of my goal. 

Also try to make some yummy Keto snacks!!! Pinterest has a ton of great recipes. I made Keto chocolate cheesecakes and they were soOoo good"

bipolar2,f2fqrp0,t3_ddcf76,1570221398.0,Same. Also very interesting about the experience that you had when decreasing then going back. I’m not consistent with taking my combo but I’m trying to work on that. I can’t tell if they are a good combo yet bc my pdoc recently made a change so until I take consistently I’m not sure. Just wanted to say this gave me a bit of hope for when I do get that balance
bipolar2,f2fq38q,t3_ddai7u,1570221181.0,I was diagnosed bipolar 2 with GAD and some OCD. I have also wondered this. I read the book walking on eggshells which is about BPD  and A LOT of the book resonated with me- but not all of it. I told my therapist I thought I had BPD bc I read the book etc and she said I definitely wasn’t borderline. It actually crushed me in a way? But she’s a professional so I dunno. My take away is that it’s totally ok to resonate with pieces of BPD behaviors and still not actually have that diagnosis. More recently I’ve been tuning into the fact that I am actually quite OCD (I never really ever considered it) and thought ocd  may be why I have an FP. It’s an obsession? I dunno I’m still only a year into diagnosis and trying to put the pieces together !

13WeekWeightLoss,f28asr9,t3_dcbyrx,1570056810.0,"Hello everyone :) I recently gained about 8 lbs and I need to lose that in addition to the other 8 I needed to lose initially before nov 9. I started Keto Monday and I’m liking it a lot so far. I’ve tried every diet possible and while I’m very good at meeting my goal weight- it’s impossible for me to keep the weight off. I end up fluctuating up and down between 10-30 lbs every year or two, I want to stop this cycle!! I want to try to make Keto a maintenance lifestyle once I get to my goal weight.

5’6” 30 yr old woman 
9/30 174.6 lbs initial Keto weigh in 
10/2 173.6 current weight 
11/9 goal weight 155-160

I need to lose 10-15 lbs for a wedding in November, but after that I want to keep going until I can get to 15-25 lbs (or whatever that looks like- I’m down to replace fat lbs with muscle too). And after that continue Keto for maintenance."

BipolarReddit,eyz5qkb,t3_czdwjy,1567610190.0,Agnostic- want to say atheist but can’t bc once in awhile I feel that spiritual connection. I’ve had a couple traumatic events happen in the past couple years which really amped up my mania symptoms. Recently I started thinking/believing I have some kind of Jesus/living angel complex- I was sent here for a “reason”. This couples with a feeling of “why did they die and not me” ; that I go through life unscathed but I’ve been in many risky situations where I could’ve been seriously hurt it died. Brains are funnnnn
