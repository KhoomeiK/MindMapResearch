You could say getting off methadone is worse than coming off oxy's, but that's not going to help the guy coming off of oxy because it still sucks! From experience, I've come off of hard opiates, kratom, and subs. They're all shit in their own different ways and what I wish I had was empathy and motivation from others. With Kratom, most people are still going to have the acute wd's, along with the feelings of hopelessness, apathy, depression, etc., and people need support because even with K, it feels like it will last forever and we're not thinking straight when we're going through wd's. Kratom is difficult to come off of, for sure, but if you do get off it will probably be one of the BEST, albeit hardest decisions of your entire life and you will be a better and stronger person when it's through. Colors will seem brighter, the air will smell better, you'll feel happy again, you'll laugh again (like, REALLY laugh!!), you'll cry, you'll FEEL what life should feel like.

Kratom w/d was slightly better than coming off hydro but all the same symptoms were there, where other people don't seem to get any w/d's at all. I still had restless legs, vomiting, body aches and pains, the mentality of feeling like you're going to go insane, insomnia, not being able to get out of bed just being curled in a ball, etc... all the same symptoms I got from hydro w/d. Some people get none of that and they're lucky. All I'm saying is taking the way people experience withdrawal lightly doesn't help anyone going through it."

quittingkratom,fjcgoex,t1_fjbzl4w,1583219403.0,"Here's the difference. If Kratom is all you've ever taken, then the w/d's are going to be nothing compared to Oxy. But, if you're a person who used Kratom to get off of Oxy's or H, then getting off Kratom is going to be pretty similar. Kratom hits a lot of the same receptors that opiates hit, and going from Oxy to Kratom isn't avoiding the Oxy withdrawal, it's just prolonging it and making it slightly less difficult to deal with. So when people say that Kratom withdrawal is like the Oxy w/d, they're probably telling the truth if they're able to compare the two. They probably haven't allowed themselves to fully withdraw from the Oxy. That being said, everyone's biology is different.

G most likely has other women just like K further signaling that he is better than her, and simultaneously making her more attracted to him. Mix that with trauma and you have a lethal match.
