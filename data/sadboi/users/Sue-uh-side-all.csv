My thought is still why would she have me stay so long if she wasn't interested? And she never even asked me to leave I was the one to decide I was gonna go since it was like 3am. Since it was just us two it seems weird I'd stay that late otherwise.



But again who knows, anything is really possible at this point. Her semester did start and she was talking about how busy she'd be. I'm hoping it's just that. 


I think I'm gonna give it another day or two then just ask I think. 


Thanks again! She's really interesting, I hope I see her again."

Dropped out of college due to depression/suicidal thoughts and because I was failing everything anyway. So I'm drowning in student loan debt now, and to add insult to injury I went to the hospital after a suicide attempt and am now in loads of medical debt too (God bless America).



Have only a few close friends now and they live far away, I've pushed the rest of my friends away.


Not to mention I've gained a ton of weight and *hate* my body. I've had self harm problems for a long time and lately it's been when I eat too much that I do it. So between being really overweight and having a lot of scars and stretch marks I can't stand seeing myself and avoid pictures at all costs.



And now with my credit absolutely destroyed (it's like 480), tons of debt that's going into default, and failing grades while I was in college I don't think I'll be able to go back, which means I've failed my main goal in life at only 21

Yes I know you don't have to go to college but it's not about that, it's a personal goal that I've failed. My life has no purpose now, I just work at a job I've come to dread and every single day is the same. Work sleep work sleep work sleep.
