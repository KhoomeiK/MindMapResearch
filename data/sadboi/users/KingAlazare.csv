disneymagickingdoms,fqh3eya,t1_fqgj1fk,1589366462.0,Same here. Have all BATB attractions and characters except him. But I got fantasy well for the fourth time. This is just so sad.
disneymagickingdoms,fqh3apt,t3_gisn1p,1589366348.0,Mine's fantasy well. I got 4 of them.
disneymagickingdoms,fised2q,t1_fiqmjtm,1582683231.0,"Yeah. Sorry. It's Anna together with the Ice Palace not Elsa.

For me, the ear hats are the worst. I only have two options which is Alice and Hatter and Jumping Jellyfish. I refuse to get Hook cause I have spent much on this game. Working on Peter to get to 6 and donalds house at 3 and pixie hollow at 2."
disneymagickingdoms,fiqczs5,t3_f9ajzi,1582641471.0,"Michael Darling is much worse. The only way to get his ""legendary"" ears is  you'll have to get Peter Pan and Wendy to Level 7 / buy Hook / enchant Donald's house and pixie hollow to 4 / get the jumpin' jellyfish attraction / have Alice at 6 and Mad Hatter at 7 would be of great help.

His ""epic"" teddy bear token is not so bad. Well, that's me cause I have Elsa, Davy Jones, Lumiere and Cogsworth. If not, you'll only have John Darling (lvl 3) to collect the tokens."
disneymagickingdoms,fik1k2p,t3_f6z8g7,1582470492.0,193 all in kingdom and they will not rest till I got all the land and have them all maxed. Haha
disneymagickingdoms,fecue4o,t1_fecr0ev,1578984999.0,Nice. I already got the tokens to get him to level 2. Thanks.
disneymagickingdoms,fbxfhy8,t3_eeozns,1577184716.0,"I need to get Poe and Finn to 5 (both currently at 4), stay Stormtrooper at 2 (to lessen conflict) but ready to level to 3, R2D2 and C3PO to 4 since that's the level the event quests stop."

SuicideWatch,fb7oryx,t3_ebspd5,1576595816.0,I don't know but I think all people around me fcking selfish. I am always there to listen to their problems and even give advice but when it is time that I open up nobody gives a sht. Tsk that's why this time I decided to keep this all emotion by myself.
AskReddit,fazcaa7,t3_eauhhu,1576414668.0,"Hopelessness. I really don't know where I am or what I'm doing in my life right now. I don't know if I will be accepted in a job that I really wanted, I don't know if I will be able to reach my goal. I don't know. I had lost hope to everything, how do I even know if something I do will be worthwhile.

Forgive me, I just don't have anyone to share this. I have friends and family but, I never really share my emotions to them 'cause I want them to see that I am strong and always smiling. Thanks"

Especially if they have several arms rather than their five normal arms. I can still remember them, during our field work, moving very slowly and me freezing 'cause they are bunch of them huddled around me."

disneymagickingdoms,eu8aot2,t3_cf90nn,1563553283.0,Same here. Finally after so much TCs.
disneymagickingdoms,etrg2yc,t1_etrdu6h,1563120165.0,"Same also 200+ days. And I thought I might get Shenzi, damn, I may not even get rewards from Chapter 2."
disneymagickingdoms,etrfqc6,t3_cd41gw,1563119936.0,My first reaction: ‚ÄúAm I seeing this right?‚Äù Then I went straight ahead to this sub. GL is damn ambitious.
disneymagickingdoms,etrfes5,t3_cd4er1,1563119724.0,"And here I thought I have enough maleficent coins to buy chapter 2 attraction and Timon. But damn, this is way too much, I give up."

disneymagickingdoms,esng6p1,t3_c8jhvk,1562131597.0,"Yeah. Especially the changes with concessions. You can no longer buy them in shop, all are acquired in chests. Magic will be hard to get since no more magic farming üòï"
disneymagickingdoms,es34qer,t3_c56eoz,1561553426.0,Yes please. I would love Yzma in my kingdom!!
disneymagickingdoms,erzo08f,t3_c4sobk,1561443103.0,Yes please. Also add Gabby Gabby.
disneymagickingdoms,erpe0tf,t3_c30mjb,1561113331.0,"Hmmm. Maybe an interaction of characters and the attractions. My theory would be that only the maxed characters will be used to upgrade the attraction so that maxed characters will have something to do instead on home. Also, it may become like in an idle farming game. You upgrade a building, its reward increases and harvest time decreases.

I have played this game for more or less 6 months and I am beginning to find it boring. I‚Äôll wait for this update and we‚Äôll see if it will ignite the fun again. Hope this will do more good thing than bad."
depression,ermnrhi,t3_c2tftu,1561031349.0,Thanks I love you too 3000
disneymagickingdoms,er5j07q,t3_c08gmt,1560527021.0,Nope. Hated it.
manga,er5iu45,t3_c0gh5k,1560526923.0,"The fuck? That‚Äôs what you call ending?? Well that‚Äôs shit. It‚Äôs lacking conclusion, excitement, and proper landing. This is a plane crash.It is like eating a very delicious dish and when you finished it and asked for seconds they‚Äôll tell you we are out FOREVER but we‚Äôll give desserts.

Disgusting!! Not expecting from 3 remaining chapters anymore. 

Sorry, I am having violent reactions."
depression,ep9n0wt,t3_bu8iwq,1559112760.0,"Same here. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt have a life here, everything just fails, it‚Äôs better to sleep it off."
