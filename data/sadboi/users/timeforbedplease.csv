It's not as uncommon as one would hope, but it's certainly not okay for him to continue to discuss it with you after you've told him it makes you uncomfortable, and given that you are a victim/survivor of sexual assault. Personally, I wouldn't stick around. For him to act as if he doesn't remember is problematic. One, he should remember something of this nature. Two, he probably does remember and says he doesn't because he wants to discuss it further."

A parent is the person who is there for you, loves you, supports you throughout life.
