I stopped feeling so much anger towards my mom when I realized she wasn't neccessarily a ""bad person""... she's just a sick person.

AskWomen,fpowwui,t1_fpkytax,1588792062.0,"Hmm, in that case one could argue you could hire a high school kid to do the simple household chores, and eat take-out. Paying a landscaper to take care of your property would be expensive. You can flip the financial costs in this way, which makes me think it's not the best assessment of value. However if you're both just going to pay for the services rather than do the actual work, I suppose it would be extremely easy to make sure that it's split 50/50, so for people who are really picky about that sort of thing perhaps that's the best option, just outsource all chores- good for the economy. Of course, that's if you want to spend money on that sort of thing."

You are absolutely correct it is more concerning than Depression because it can be harder for sufferers to receive the proper diagnosis and subsequent care. It is also highly stigmatized, whereas Depression is generally accepted as a common mental health concern. People usually feel comfortable supporting someone with Depression, however people are often scared of other, lesser-known disorders."

It's like an artsy people thing. I don't see how I'd be embarrassed if my family member did it when it's so prevalent, especially at sports events. It's not like anyone is going to openly criticize them for it and if they did, I'd come at them bc that's my fam, you don't mess w/ them, even if they are expressing themselves in a more, umm, creative? way than I would personally choose I guess. I guess you prefer more conformity when it comes to what people chose to wear, which a lot of people might consider boring, but you do you. I think people enjoy it for it just being something interesting and different to see, instead of everyone wearing say, the same few combinations of team colors on jerseys. Boring, most people enjoy visual interest! Now if they are distracting you from being able to focus on the game, ok that makes sense.

They might be trying to surprise you and not want to say it's because of that! Otherwise, yeah if it makes my SO feel better and build trust to see my phone, why wouldn't I want to make them feel more comfortable with me? So what if they are a little insecure, maybe they had a bad experience and it takes them longer to build trust. Ok, if there's nothing to hide and they aren't getting unhealthily neurotic about it, big deal! I can only assume there are things people with any other opinion would be embarrassed about their SO finding, otherwise, why would they care whatsoever? It doesn't mean they are cheating neccessarily, but have something embarrassing to them- once you're in a solid relationship you drop those kind of feelings so I think they must be in some newer relationship to still have anything to feel embarrassed about. I never understood people who say they need privacy in a relationship. I prefer total openess, it's more freeing to have a person you can reveal all to and still be accepted.

AskWomen,fpiy86k,t1_fpimn59,1588651587.0,"I think that depends on where you live as far as yardwork, perhaps. I live in the midwest, and if there isn't weeding, watering, lawnmowing and leaf raking, then there is clearing the driveway and walkways of snow which is a task I'd gladly never have to be in charge of! Gutters, mulching, and other various landscaping needs are much more labor-intensive than the daily indoors chores- even if they are done mulitple times. I think the energy requirement required vs the frequency of tasks must be taken into consideration.  It really doesn't take anywhere near the amount of effort for me to do domestic tasks on a regular basis as it does for the labor intensive outdoor jobs my husband ends up taking on. Also he also helps his elderly parents with their yardwork as well. So far none of our parents require my assistance with housework, as it doesn't take as much physical effort to keep up with in general. Also my tasks can be done in short spurts with plenty of breaks if I so wish, his outdoor work often requires him to go on for hours at a time because of weather changes- he must finish things before things like the rain comes in or the work can be ruined!"

Everyone has that choice, and I want to make sure people know that instead of being pressured to have sex with people just to figure things out. Hearts are more important than parts for me personally, and I don't need to let my sexuality define me. I was very pressured to behave otherwise, and I don't want anyone being made to feel that way. Everyone should be free to choose their own path! Sex isn't everything. I can love the women in my life and not have to have sex with them. That is basically what it comes down to, and you are free to be different, but there are people who don't know they can be attracted to people without having sex with them. Being taught that was the only way filled my world with pain for many years. Thankfully I am more free to love others in different ways now, and it's perfectly ok for me to do that!"

Just because I was born or through whatever way ended up with this ability, doesn't mean I need to make it an active part of my life.  I have to really fight not doing it a lot of times, as it would make my life seem so much easier in many circumstances. However, I still love myself and know God loves me and I hope I can somehow use this naughty part of me to bring about some good.  I grew to see my same sex attractions in the same way.  I am happily married to my husband, but I will always appreciate the beauty of all of God's creation, without needing to fornicate with it.  I grieve the premarital sex that I did engage in, because through God's grace alone I came to learn how truly next level sex within marriage truly is. I listened to what the world tried to tell me about what they thought I should do about my sexuality for way too long, and it only led to heartache. Being in a loving marriage has truly healed my soul. I hope all people who struggle with their sexuality can find the love and acceptance for who they are in God, He won't leave them out to dry if they truly bring their thirst to Him and allow Him to be the one to quench it!"

It made a lot of sense when someone explained the vain repetition part as what it means by vain, that specifically what makes it vain for pagans- their worship is not to the true God our Lord, but false gods.  They pray in vain as they will get no answer and it is for nothing. Our repetitions are not in vain as we are praying to the true God.  I thought it was a really insightful way to look at it.  I've never noticed the word babbling being used, but when I looked up the definition, Oxford describes it as talking rapidly and continuously in a foolish, excited, or incomprehensible way.  In that sense, I think it is logical to say none of us should be praying in such a way, it really sounds quite irreverent to pray in that way to the true God, nevermind who the pagans are praying to!"

That could be getting close to bordering on being suicidal, which is not a part of His plan for any of us.  We must ask for His will to guide us in these things, and not be prideful to interpret wrongly what that may be, even if it makes us walk through difficult things.

DuggarsSnark,ffmiy1m,t1_ffm7g8v,1580055412.0,"LOL!  I forgot I've heard someone put it like that before! I really am still trying to figure out all my beliefs actually! I know I love others and trying to love myself even though I do a lot of things unhealthy for me, but always trying to grow. I can't say I have a def liberal agenda or anything, but I guess I would be so sad to be judged in a negative way for my hair and it is the risk that is taken.  I guess I settle it as those who matter don't mind, and those who mind don't matter!  I like to think it makes some people who do feel so judged feel like they can feel safe talking to me, which they sure can!"
DuggarsSnark,ffmhr00,t1_ffjgsqa,1580054806.0,"Yes I have to admit I've felt terrible I've ghosted people, but I'm trying to deal with it with therapy and maybe I can courage up to open back up to some people that happened with.  I don't like the idea I've made people suffer, as I've suffered much in fears of rejection.  I feel this is all calling me to work harder to make amends, but then is it getting close to putting too much responsibility to be accountable for others' feelings and adding to guilt in an unhealthy way?  I'm terrible at boundaries, if nothing else, thanks to all for these discussions, I have more things to bring to my therapist, haha."
DuggarsSnark,ffmgmko,t1_ffj9tf1,1580054380.0,I don't think you were rambling- it's all helpful in learning what those people are all about and how exclusive most of them tend to make the cult.

I guess if we are all supposed to be apt to do bad stuff we can't be surprised people in church aren't perfect.  I hope I could find one that would encourage growth to all members.  There is a lot of pride and egos involved in any institution, but I don't want it to get in the way of me growing as a person.  It's a tough thing to deal with for sure.  Idk just wanted to throw out these thoughts, I'm trying to learn and grow and do it while using good sense.  I like to hope church could be a good resource, but I'm sceptical."
DuggarsSnark,ffmei68,t1_ffizg2i,1580053377.0,"This is so fascinating to me.  I can't imagine not having God as my rock.  Besides the tons of therapy I do, I don't know how I could manage to keep going without that, personally.  I've been studying this stuff most my life though, but always willing to learn more and often challenging my beliefs.  If I may ask, what brings you strength in absence of God?  I wonder about how you came to your decision about God ultimately, since you seem like you were really seeking, like I am."

DuggarsSnark,ffm9vop,t1_ffkxc7i,1580051082.0,"I like to think it could help in the way of society eventually learning what the truth is- about it being a cult and helping people out of it.  If they also had a program showing that side of things, like other people's experiences with the negative aspect, it would even the field so we have both points of view and can come to our best conclusion about the truth.  Sad people could be drawn into it though, since TLC doesn't offer resources directly to learn more and people must search for themselves."
DuggarsSnark,ffm8zgl,t1_ffkyht0,1580050660.0,How incredibly heart-breaking!  It must have been so hard to learn the truth behind it all.  Sorry you had to go through all that but thank you for being brave and beautiful to share all of this!  It is really so helpful!!!
DuggarsSnark,ffm7lq0,t1_ffiog2j,1580049847.0,"That is one reason Catholocism is so appealing to me right now.  I actually now like the whole confession idea thing.  Which is so funny since I was taught to be bigoted towards Catholicism and sadly was for years until I've had the gumption to actually study it.  It's so fun we can learn so much and grow.  I hope you have found a good way to deal with things such as guilt for example.  I'm learning a lot and have much to learn, I'm hopeful perhaps Catholicism can provide some insight but always wary and open-minded since I also was attracted to the Duggars in the same way you were.  It's so helpful you are doing this AMA and hopefully I'm not commenting too soon as still reading through.  But def want to pause and say thank you!  I would have loved to have gone to one of those retreats when I was younger, but can now see it was probably much much better I did not have that opportunity!  Although you seem to have learned a lot in the process, and it's truly helping others who are also seekers!"

DuggarsSnark,ffjulcj,t1_ffj6kin,1580007372.0,"To each their own! It really depends on how the entire outfit is put together imo. Here in Ohio it's very hit or miss. A lot of people do wear it in a trashy looking way, and then you have some that pull off making it look classy with usually just having a touch with their accessories. I think it's being used in a more versatile way than it used to, like on a watch band or something more discreet than say, a hooker looking lacey top or something.  In this area anyways!"
DuggarsSnark,ffj3850,t1_ffiv4v7,1579989256.0,"I won't really fight for this lol but I think it's used and considered to be a neutral print now, which I think is fun since it is multi-colored unlike what is generally considered to be neutral.  Also I think the beauty of the animal is astounding, although it looks better on them than us I'd say haha.  It's hilarious to see a Duggar girl in it though as it used to be considered a ""sexy"" print to wear, although I think that's pretty much an outdated view but who knows in some places, especially in the U.S. South I'd guess. Anyone else care to weigh in?  Is it just seen as an optional print to use in our fashion if you like it, or still a sign of being a shameless hussy whereever you are from?"

I have a feeling it's worse than what we even know, and JB has completely shunned her if not entirely able to force the rest of them to (yet). Jill is also known for posting older pics at times, perhaps she's letting on that she misses them but it's actually been awhile since they spent that time together. I'm not interested enough to dig that far on my own, heh. I think we only know the tip of the iceberg of abuse that the girls have gone through however.  We'll just have to agree to disagree, maybe their next scandal will help sort it all out... we shouldn't have to wait too long right?"
DuggarsSnark,ffipttb,t1_ffin642,1579979719.0,"Even if it is one of the kids running it, they still must post only what they are allowed per JB. Whomever it is sure had plenty of wonderful things to say about Josh!  They seem to consistently give birthday shoutouts and generically say what is so great about that particular person.  Sometimes pics with them spending time with their kids/ grandkids and saying how precious or whatever the specific people they spent time with are.  In like two years, these things that they do for all the other kids, including disgusting sexpest, have not been done for Jill.  That seems to speak volumes to me!"
YouOnLifetime,ffioonq,t1_ffhncjj,1579978919.0,"This so much. 

Spoilers:

Love seems to have no problem with her actions and is like yay we're both the same kind of sick everything is fine now.  I honestly expect to find out she is the reason her husband died, imo she is more of a true sociopath by nature, as opposed to Joe being one moreso by how he grew up.

Joe is very torn about what he's done, he has trauma flashbacks that to me indicate less of a sociopathic tendency (as a sociopath wouldn't generally be morally affected enough to have that issue).  He showed himself working on changing his behavior by letting someone out of the box, and was attempting to do it again with Delilah.  He was horrified when he saw Love's true nature, he wants to grow beyond that.  Those are all good things!  

I root for someone mentally ill who wants to take responsibility for their actions and grow and become a better person changing those actions.  Our mental illnesses and/or troubled pasts don't have to define us.  This is the sort of person they have been presenting us with Joe.   

He needs to realize he can't change on his own without professional help.  He needs to accept the consequences of his actions. Therapy, facing the justice system, moving on to doing positive things for society.  I think we're unfortunately not going to get that, as they seemed to show at the ending scene.  

I like to hope it could turn out to be more of an ok, he had some steps forward, now it will be some steps back. Perhaps finding out Love's child is not his and being able to get away from her.  In my opinion, she's the true sociopath and I don't understand how anyone can root for her. 

Ultimately, it would be great if he would learn what he needs to in order to continue on the growth path they have shown him capable of.  I feel perhaps the actor has seen this is not the direction they will continue to take the character in however, and they will go full villain mode. 

I remain hopeful we may get some positive message from this show, rather than just more of the same old.  It would be refreshing, but not looking that great.  Hopefully that is only what they want us to think!"

Right now Will doesn't want to have his actions accepted, and Love is willing to accept them both as they are.  Yikes, that is not smart at all.  I think people give her way too much credit.  However Joe needs to realize he needs help to sort out his damage and actions, and the ending of this season is not making that look good."
YouOnLifetime,fe7prek,t1_fe3x0ou,1578917803.0,"I would argue his intentions are what show that there may be a possiblity for him to address his damage and truly grow away from unhealthy behaviors. He is not just blindly accepting himself as is (rather horrified that Love would want to do that), and has challenged some of his beliefs.  He gave himself the possibility of the law getting him when he let Will go, and he knew that.  I believe they are showing potential for growth, but he needs to get help in order to be able to do that, and I think THAT is what people have a hard time accepting- you can't just deal with your damage on your own and get to a healthy place.  He really does need to admit that, and it would be so nice to see a character like him be able to actually do that!  Let's encourage society to be ok with needing help to fix our damage, and see more examples of that in the world!  Don't know if this show will do it."
DuggarsSnark,fe7nyhx,t1_fe697x8,1578917242.0,"I'm sorry to hear about your experience, but thank you for being willing to share it. I think the idea can be very alluring to have rules to follow that are supposed to give us the life we want if followed correctly.  It's much harder than that however in reality.  It's so interesting how people's different paths can lead to similar places.  You found atheism helpful for you to grow as a person.  I can say for me choosing faith helps me grow to (hopefully!) be a better person.  I'm so glad that we get to choose what works and can face whatever damaged us in the past!"
YouOnLifetime,fe7miwm,t1_fe676wc,1578916514.0,"Aww, that was such a fun concept to explore!  It would make sense that he would potentially address one of the sources of his damage. Sad if they are going with his behavior regressing backwards, he was showing potential for growth."
YouOnLifetime,fe7l8h0,t1_fe69pqb,1578916069.0,"I don't see you as being harsh, but cool of you to be sensitive to that.  You've made your points clear and with respectful language.  That's the best I hope for with these type of discussions!  

It's not clear cut where all the characters are coming from, true, 3rd season would address this I hope. I can only base my opinion on what we've been shown so far.  I like to hope it matters where the behavior came from.  If it is indeed a part of their nature, it makes it more difficult to address the dysfunction, rather than them being conditioned that way. Joe wasn't born damaged, at least, so far that is shown.  He loved his mother enough to put her safety ahead of his and endure the abuse of his father to try to protect her.  That is perfectly natural for a child.  

The problem is when his mother introduced the idea that murder was an appropriate solution to their problem.  Once he did murder his father, the possible saving grace is that he was only partly rewarded for that behavior.  He protected his mom, yes, but also lost her since she finally did the right thing of acknowledging it wasn't right and she wasn't the best one to raise him.  Therapy and getting the law involved would have been the appropriate response rather than discarding him. 

However he did experience the negative consequence of going into foster care, and then ending up with an abusive foster parent furthur damaging him.  Since he had both positive (protecting mom) and negative (losing mom) consequences, there is not an absolute in his head that is formed with the behavior of killing, it's left a bit open for him to later be able to judge.  

I argue that we do see him struggle with his actions.  He does think of the other people he's affecting and that is why he is traumatized by the killing, his seeing ghosts and blood and such is the proof there.  He knows this is bad, and that killing has caused these things.  So he is able to challenge his belief that box = murder and see that with Will it led to positive consequences.  What we need to happen is him face his legal consequences and get the therapy he needs to address what damaged him.  We all want to hope we can grow past our damage.  

Joe is thinking he can do it on his own though, which is where the fatal flaw lies.  Delilah pointed out damaged finds damaged every time.  Clearly by ending up with Love, that is shown to be true.  But will he see that he needs to fix his damage for any chance to end up with the kind of healthy relationship he hopes for?  It's not looking good.  

We don't know enough about Love.  It appears she came up with the idea of murdering the nanny on her own, and that is what scares me most, that her nature is the true factor in her case. I'm not sure why people see her as more self aware and perceptive. She watched her actions destroy her brother's life, and it did not traumatize her enough to challenge her beliefs, which is what very much disturbs me.  We will have to see though!  

It was looking like we could be glad Joe recognizes he shouldn't accept his behavior as normal and something to continue.  As he wasn't ok with Love accepting that part of him, that shows he isn't ok with it.  He still is doing unhealthy behaviors, yes, like the kidnapping and identity theft yes, but he proved he didn't have to murder someone so that is what he was able to change.  The hope is he can go furthur and examine his other unhealthy behaviors like stalking and kidnapping and such. It's looking like he may regress and go back to bad behaviors though, yes.  I can only hope we are given a damaged character that can learn eventually what the healthy way to address that damage is.  That is the world I would like to live in!

Not looking like they will take him there sadly.
