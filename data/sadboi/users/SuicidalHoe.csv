Advice,fqgx88c,t3_giru8n,1589360293.0,"That one guy you hit it off with great but has now ghosted you? Don't fall for his tricks again if he ever messages you back. He knows you've tried reaching out. He chose to ignore you until he needed you again. 

Also don't stay in toxic relationships. Common sign of toxicity is having mostly bad days full of arguing or crying or yelling and or gas lighting, but there are some days that are just really good. And the really good days feel like heaven. Don't fall for the really good days. You don't need to feel like crap to make someone love you.

Be perfectly honest in your relationships. Your partner is not a mind reader. If you're upset or if you want something or if you're embarrassed, let them know. It takes 2 people to make a relationship. Let them be there."

I had my best friend over and I was talking to this guy. We weren't official and were feeling each other out. Finally, I ask him if he wants to come over. So he does.

We all slept in my Queen sized bed that night. I slept cuddled up to him mostly naked while my best friend slept at the end of the bed with my new puppy. Nothing happened. Just some half naked cuddling. The second night she decided to sleep downstairs on the couch instead. I couldn't blame her. Cuddled the guy I was seeing that night again. Still, nothing happened.

Tons of space down stairs, like the living room, dining room, kitchen, den, etc were all very spaced out. It echoed. They had a grand staircase *and* a spiral staircase. They had 3 bedrooms, a theater room, and a misc room that I rarely went in.   


He stayed over at my house one night (quite the opposite) and I made him toast and scrambled eggs for breakfast the next morning. I said ""I made breakfast!"" and he was like ""You call this making breakfast? This is what my mom makes when she's lazy.""   


Like, okay Upper Class Boi. Calm down. I'm poor."

AskReddit,f8dpzs7,t3_e07nci,1574504312.0,"I used to be best friends with this girl, we'll call her B. B and I go way back, to 4th grade where we met and became best friends. Freshman year of high school I started dating a guy and the relationship ended up being very toxic. B would often times tell me to break up with him and made it clear she didn't like him. As soon as I broke up with him at the end of Sophomore year, I spent my time hanging out with other males as well as telling B everything that happened and how I feel at all times. I needed someone to vent to and she was there. Keep in mind, these guys that I was talking to were not romantic interests. They were friends. But I would tell B everything. B ended up becoming great friends with my toxic ex and started spreading rumors that I was a slut and having sex with several guys.   
I lost all of my friends because of her and of course, lost her too. I was hurt.   


I come to find out 4 years later that she's Schiz. I suspect that the rumors she spread were false memories she possessed, probably due to the amount of information I told her and her mulling over the information until the story changed. A common trait in Schiz. I had another friend who was Schiz as well and he did this exact same thing with his old high school classmates. He was in college when I talked to him. Anyway, B has had very vivid hallucinations and paranoia since then. She refuses to admit she has a mental illness, despite the obvious signs and the history of Schiz her family has.   


I still love her and i wish the best for her. But yeah, I'm never talking to her again."
