BPD,fq59d9n,t1_fpwfb2e,1589096931.0,"Thank you so much for the thoughtful reply.  I read the links and it looks like I am doing everything right to far. She cut deep tonight and I spoke to her while she was in the ambulance on the way to the ER. She said she was sorry she ruined my Mother's Day, that she's a failure and a disappointment. I asked probing questions- what makes you think that, why do you feel that way? I want to say, ""You aren't."" I am not sure if that is invalidating though because I know that's how she feels. Sometimes I say, ""I'm sad you feel that way. I don't think that."" Any thoughts? Thanks for your help!"
BPD,fpulpg7,t3_gfk1qy,1588916281.0,Mom of PwBPD and I concur. My daughter is a SURVIVOR as are all of you! Your exquisitely sensitive wiring is not for the faint of heart and I commend you for keeping on in a very invalidating world.

BPD,fpmxuwn,t1_fpmvi92,1588744564.0,I am so touched by your reply. My tank is running low and your words are filling me up. Thanks for those validating words and I will use them with my daughter. I really like the strong part about her coming to me with it because she often feels like a burden. This quarantine has deeply affected her so she's doing the best she can and I reiterate that often. Thanks again!

I say this as an adoptive mom of 3 kiddos we foster-adopted with special needs. Really soul search what you are able to handle. Not trying to discourage you at all but go in this with full knowledge."
