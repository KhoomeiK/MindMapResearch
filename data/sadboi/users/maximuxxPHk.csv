Its verdant,and lots of medicinal plants are also found.Our cultures vary according to the tribes within it but is a far cry away from the rest of the main Indian states. Though its a nice place,it has its fair share of problems like corruption,dying culture,and lack of self sufficiency,illiteracy and unemployment,and also most of the northeastern states are not looked upon as Indians by the Mainland Indians(not all of them) and we often get associated with the chinese which can cause a lot of problems during the present situation.
           Other than that there are really cool things like Dzukou valley,Japfü mountain,Khonoma village(first green village of India),Hornbill festival and it is also home to king chilli,..

SuicideWatch,fnjpljm,t3_g1v6na,1587004070.0,"Hey...I too feel like a burden,I have never done anything good in my life.I have stolen,lied,betrayed,cheated(which i regret everyday) and went through a very depressive phase where i suspected myself to have schizoid personality disorder and right now i have 5 backpapers in a single semester of my university.After all these it pretty much feels like life is not worth livin and troubles.
    I wont tell you why life is worth the living,but i want you to know it does get better.First start by praying(doesnt have to be to any religious God),get yourself hydrated ,drink two cups of water,have a proper food if you're hungry..if you have done it till here,you're doing great(helping yourself is the beginning of every good thing)..
      Now try to stay away from any super stimulants like caffeine,video games,porn (these things are an addiction to me itself and these things have contributed a lot to my depression)..If you have friends or family you may reach out to them,but i undertand if you cannot since depression is tough on us.Next i would suggest exercising,start simple,its not to get a great body,its for keeping healthy.I do calisthenics now.
        There are many sources of great information out in youtube,i watch a lot of workout,motivational and lifestyle related videos and also videos of cute foxes..For the time being stay sway from negative media such as violence,sad songs(doesnt mean you have to listen to happy songs) since they lead you in a negative spiral...In the meanwhile,try to find a passion.Try out new things
   Sorry for the wall of text,but i wanted to help.This things won't be easy and everyday is not the same,but  take baby steps and eventually you will see the light at the end of the tunnel.Stay positive"
