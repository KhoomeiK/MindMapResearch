I was told it takes a little bit of time before seeing results and during that time your anxiety and depression may get worse for a little bit. I‚Äôve lost 10 lbs since being on it and my moods are starting to get elevated. The only weird side effects for me are vivid dreams and i was nauseous my first few days taking it.

It‚Äôll make your breasts hurt, your mood change, your appetite change, and you may even get spotting or miss your period. Still doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre pregnant however."

Staying cooped up in the house all day really triggers my anxiety, but distractions help tons! Study, take a nap, do something for yourself.

whether it was a place to stay, clothes, food, money, makeup, whatever. 

I used to get extremely annoyed by this and never said anything, I would just go along, because she obviously needed it more than me in that moment. 

Well one day she invited me over for the first time, I had never been over to her house and we were now juniors in high school, and we had been friends since freshman year. 

She lived with her parents in a relatively middle class home. But her parents were complete drug addicts, we walked in with spoons, baggies, syringes, and various homemade pipes and bongs were on the tables and countertops.

Not to mention the house reeked of cigarettes, marijuana, and stale scents.

I immediately realized why she mooched the way she did, and felt extremely bad. You could tell by her living style her parents devoted their money towards drugs.

I never felt bad about her borrowing stuff again."

We want to do good and get better & most of the time we have goals and motivation and life is great. But the flip of a switch can happen any minute and we feel like everything is too much to handle and the world is slowly collapsing around us. Personally for me and a lot of other BPD sufferers, I have trouble committing and I push my relationships away and don‚Äôt let them in my head, which is vital for a relationship. I grow distant and question them a lot. I will constantly compare myself to their exes or ill make myself believe they‚Äôre gonna leave me. My best advice is constantly reassure her when she needs it. Reassurance is one of the best things."
