My ultimate goal used to be to take over the world. It evolved into the need to become famous and exploit that nuance of human vulnerability into a power grab. It was the reason I learned to juggle, or at least why I poured so many hours into it in such a short span of time.

Now I think local recognition in my hometown is enough to sate that innate desire to be larger than life. I want to enjoy life, that's my goal, and I can't do that being a nobody. I'm just not socialized enough to create a social network of worth in any other way. So, I'll crank the awesome up to 11 and be who I was always meant to be.

Basically, I want to live the life I was meant to live but was unable due to the backwards system we're a part of combined with my mental eccentricity. That's how I'm classifying my mental illness now. I'm not disabled, I just can't fit into the expectations of the common culture as well as other people.

Daniella would go into town with beets rubbed on her face. She looked ridiculous and got people to crane their heads at our group. We would later find out that the town of Lakeport California referred to our group as ""the manson family.""

Daniella would mail drugs across the country to one of her contacts in Florida.

We once found a turkey near the waterfront of lakeport and Daniella insisted on taking the feathers right there on the side of mainstreet. She also did a blood magick ritual while cars zipped by, their inhabitants craning their necks to see what the hell we were doing.

We would use all our foodstamps to buy everything we could from the Ukiah co-op. I would get ridiculed for buying things I wanted while Daniella bought whatever frivolous items she wanted for her cooking.

We worked on a farm/retreat center known as rainbow buddha where we camped for over a month. This is where I would labor for over ten hours a day for no pay in 100 degree heat. 

We drove back to Nevada to handle the parking ticket which daniella managed to talk her way out of because the judge did not show up for the hearing.

We went to a variety of farmer's markets, some up to three hours away, where we set up our little nonprofit shop and did the most ridiculous stunts. Daniella would have me juggle and once told me that I stunk because of the gas I had.

We browsed churches and other places where they gave away free clothes and whatnot and daniella made us dress in the most ridiculous outfits.

Mike fasted for up to a week at a time and tried to grow sprouts but failed. He would regularly sleep outside even though there was room inside for him.

Awen and I fought a lot, and this was all set up. Like, we would get into arguments that daniella planned for us to get into.

Daniella made us lie on our taxes to try to get the maximum possible benefit. Fortunately, my dad claimed me as a dependant and turbotax would not give me any refund, so I was able to change all the information back in a rush during the week it was due without her knowing.

We saw a UFO that was flying erratically at the rainbow buddha property.

The owners of the rainbow buddha property got suspicious of daniella after I cut into my arm to get to the hospital. They eventually separated her from us and sent us back home to new york on a train."

It is impossible to describe the blindfolded trance dance. As the music blasted and I gyrated to it for an hour, I got in touch with a part of myself that I was not even aware was alive. In the time since, I have learned that it was my feminine half, but in the moment, while I was still deep in denial over my gender, it was completely foreign to me. 

The dance ended on a somber note, and when I took my blindfold off, I was crying. Something was terribly wrong. Nothing about my life was right. Staring out into the crowd of people, I felt something ripping into the back of my psyche. I collapsed on the couch, and Awen came to comfort me, but I wanted nothing to do with her, or anyone. I felt alone despite being surrounded by people. I felt a sick combination of sadness and anger. From that couch I stared out at all the happy faces and immediately began to resent every single one of them. In the moment, I felt like I had been denied a huge part of myself that everyone else just sort of had.

In the days that followed, the word “sociopath” made itself a statistical anomaly as it found its way into conversations around me without fail. Nearly every gathering had people discussing something with the theme of sociopathy, and I took this as a subliminal sign that I needed to become more like a sociopath in order to fit in to my new Illuminati family. Keep in mind that this was all part of the brainwashing and was used to make me more complicit in the events to come.

The next week was one I am not proud of. I lied. I stole. I cheated in the games we played. I was overall a sour human being, but my attitude was praised in subtle ways that led me to believe I was on the right path. This was all combined with some monk-like training, where I would balance on bricks, take cold showers, and go for a long run every morning. I felt I was eroding everything that had been holding me back throughout the years and was becoming a real player on the world stage.

But what I was really doing was hurting Awen. I was terrible to her throughout this time. In hindsight, this may have been the purpose of the conditioning, because it drove us apart from one another. I even told her that we were done - that I was gay and that our relationship could not continue. We eventually made up, but this was my interpretation of my highly repressed feminine energies in the moment.

Throughout this time, we were routinely leaving Heartland to go to a local Starbucks to use their internet. This would be the start of a long habit of needing to go to a cafe to use their wifi. From here on out, our internet access was severely limited, so we became a small group that was functionally cut off from the outside world. Sure, we could use the internet for what we wanted, but we were shamed into wanting to use it for the project - writing Steemit posts and other activities that directly benefited Lovecycle.

Also, food was becoming scarcer. We were well fed at Heartland, but the shortage of food stamps made it seem like we needed to be careful with our resources. On several occasions, we would pull a scam where we would trade back some of the fifty pounds of almonds we were carrying with us in the back of Gaia in exchange for credit at Whole Foods. Awen did not want to do it, but Daniella berated and shamed her until she was complicit. I was already onboard with my defective thinking taking over by this point.

Eventually, we would leave, but not before damaging Gaia. 



This is the extent that I think I will be able to tell a reliable story. The events from here on out are too fuzzy in my head to display coherently. I will attempt to tell some of the highlights as I can remember them but they are in no order for the time we were at Jared’s and the time we spent at Rainbow Buddha."

So, we were abandoned at Triangle Lake with barely any money, and neither my girlfriend nor I knew how to drive. In swoops Daniella as a new motherly figure that will solve all of our problems. We would travel with her in the old car donated to Earth Nation by a farmer named Jared, and where we would head we had no idea.

At first, we headed back to the healer’s house to stay for a few days while we recuperated. During this time, Daniella hatched a brilliant plan for me to write a ransom note of sorts that detailed all the character flaws and illegal activity that Dakota and Lila were up to. I wrote it, but decided against sending it anywhere. I was in a quasi-state of rebellion, but Awen won over my better side and let it all slide. We were free now, there was no sense in seeking out revenge. Victory, not vengeance would rule our ship.

This upset Daniella, but she bit her tongue. That would be one of the only times we would be able to defy her wishes without some sort of verbal retaliation. That was her thing - she kept us docile with massive amounts of weed and any time we steered of her chosen path we would be cut to shreds with her tongue. It is impossible to describe how vile she could spit venom, but to understand all you must know is that we broke down crying on many occasions after she decided to keep us in line by shitting in our souls.

We were already conditioned to take this sort of abuse, so those few times it happened in the beginning of our travels went mostly unnoticed. Overall, Daniella was very pleasant to us during this time and this period served as a sort of honeymoon for Awen and I. In fact, since Daniella needed to go back home to Florida during this time, we got to go to Las Vegas for a brief trip, as the plane tickets are significantly cheaper in and out of the desert city.

The three days we stayed in Nevada were great. However, they did not start fantastically. As Daniella was whizzing through the deserted roads early in the morning, she was pulled over for recklessly speeding. As we waited for the cop to walk up to our car, Daniella said she forgot that these roads were over patrolled in order to pull in some extra income for the smaller towns on the outskirts of Las Vegas. What made matters worse was that Daniella did not have a license when she was pulled over.

While I waited in the cramped back of the car with everything we could have packed, I felt my stomach sink to new lows. This was it. We were about to be abandoned in the middle of nowhere with no resources at our disposal. I started to cry silently behind Awen, who was terrified as well. Yet, nothing happened. Daniella managed to talk her way out of everything but a ticket for speeding upwards of a hundred miles and hour in a sixty with no driver’s license. In the time we drove off, she told us how easy it was to manipulate cops and get away with just about anything, and she had the experience to back up her claims.
 
Our time in Vegas mostly amounted to doing what free stuff we could do in the three days we were there. I tried out some performance arts with my juggling, but otherwise the trip was uneventful. When Daniella returned, we left for an intentional community named Heartland. Josh, the carpenter from earlier, invited us to stay there as that was where he had left to after his time at Triangle Lake. We felt it would be a good place to get our bearings and figure out the next step of our own plan.

Before New Years arrived on the calendar, we were arriving at Heartland in northern California. Well off the grid, this location required us to travel through winding back roads through cattle-infested lands. We gawked in amazement in the sheer hoards of sheep, cows, and goats. Likewise, the sparse, gnarled, twisted trees amongst the yellow grass gave the impression of an alien landscape. 

After slowly cruising for what seemed like hours, we found ourselves at an old gate. Without skipping a beat, Daniella hopped out of Gaia and opened it. Both Awen and I were nervous that we were in the wrong place as there was nothing indicating that this was in fact Heartland. But, Daniella was sure of herself as she always was and we kept crawling on the gravel road. She was proven right when we approached a second gate with a sign that read Heartland.

The area was fairly empty save for a few buildings. There was a barn with an abundance of building materials stacked on the side. A great stage sat some distance away, with a tent and a wooden structure that turned out to be a kitchen and shower area, respectfully. To our immediate left was a large recycling structure labeled appropriately, and in the distance sat a small log cabin. Also, there were several RV’s and mobile homes that were spread throughout the main area and up the hill to our right.

The people here were just as cheery and excited to greet us with hugs as when we first arrived at Triangle Lake. The land was owned by a Swedish family, and there were several people from other countries as well. This is where we met Mike, the flat-Earther from Belgium noted previously. But, to begin with we started hanging out with Josh who showed us the inside of the barn that was being renovated.

There was an event planned to happen on New Years Eve - a blindfolded trance dance - and the barn needed to be in working order before we could partake. As this was an intentional community that was run like a business we needed to work four hours a day on their projects or else we would have to pay to stay. Since we had so little funds, we would be trapped here if we did not have the gas to leave. But, Daniella shooed away our concerns and told us that this was a great place to be. Just look at the serene landscape.

I am uncertain how much of Heartland was in cohorts with Earth Nation. They may be completely separate entities that just so happened to have Josh there waiting for us and had its own style of community policing that played off my schizoaffective disorder just as Earth Nation did.

While working on the barn, I received several synchronicities that eventually led to me having a panic attack. It felt like everything was starting over, but the reassurance I got from the members of Heartland helped dissuade thoughts that I was trapped in another control system. In fact, we were still so new to life without Earth Nation that I believed it was just an after effect of spending so much time in the clutches of Dakota and Lila.

Also during this time, we headed up the hill and met the builder that lived up there. He lived apart from the rest of the community and merely wanted to use the advertised flow space of Heartland to build his mutant vehicle for Burning Man. He was building a four-story bus with stages that could fold up into the sides. It looked incredible and it was astounding to meet someone with such talent in such a remote place. Combined with the talent of the jewelry maker and the other artists that were there, I felt for sure that I was taken to this space because I also had a talent that needed to be developed.

This was when the synchronicities regarding joining the Illuminati started. Through subtle cross-talk sessions and little snippets placed in conversation, I began to believe that I was joining something greater than was visible to the eye. These sorts of mental nudges would continue through the entirety of my odyssey in California, changing from the Illuminati, to the Free Masons, and even the CIA. I was so certain that I was part of something greater that it allowed Daniella and others to abuse me to such great extents that I would eventually snap and harm myself.
 
But that was still a long ways off. In the present, we were simply rebuilding the barn. In just a few days we transformed the inside of the barn from a dilapidated work space to a swanky party space with couches, carpets and a complete kitchen. The second floor of the barn was also home to several matted pads that were stacked together to create a great purple sleeping area for the expected visitors to the trance dance.

And to my surprise, many people did show up to the remote location to partake in the festivities. I feel that it was deliberately advertised as more of a party, as we had several strangers come up and ask us if there was any LSD, of which there was none to my knowledge. Regardless, it was a fun pregame party with the abundance of weed that was available at Heartland, and soon we headed inside to be blindfolded for the main event.

This is what I mean when they planned events and conditioned us. I was constantly failing as the work piled up so high I couldn’t see anything else but the duties I apparently signed up for. I became a workhorse that operated daily for them, usually as I sat hunched over my laptop in the main office for ten hours a day in order to accomplish what they considered only a few hours worth of work.

My main duties consisted of writing for them, and I worked with Teahna to finish their manifesto, research and write grants, write website content for them, as well as write articles they would post on Steemit to earn them massive amount of cryptocurrency through bot manipulation. I also had to help Lila with the media team and Prism with the educational team. Not only that, but I was pressured to edit Prism’s book. There was always something new popping up and the way I was asked always led to me feeling overwhelmingly compelled to take on the task, even if it was impossible for me to accomplish what it is they were hoping for.

Additionally, we had to attend a copious number of meetings. These were mostly with others who had drank the kool-aid and were completely sucked in to their way of life. However, there were also meetings with investors. One in particular stands out: Kelly. She was a philanthropist from Australia who wound up donating six-hundred ethereum, which at the time of the bitcoin bubble was worth six hundred thousand dollars. I don’t know the whole relationship that led to the exchange, but the video conference that we all had with her was highly suspect. In it, Dakota talked about gold in one of the Central American properties they owned. While I was familiar with the properties they owned across the world, I had not heard anything about this gold beforehand, nor after the fact. The entire exchange that Dakota had with her sounded like he was trying to sell a bridge he inherited from a Nigerian prince who was stuck in a Spanish prison. 

Not only did we meet with investors, but as time went on, I began getting tasked with onboarding new members in the meetings. There was one poor writer who wanted to be on the team but no one thought his articles were up to snuff with posting online with our “brand.” I was left with the task of coaching him which felt like leading him on a goosechase for something he was never going to receive. 

I felt bad for him, but with the pressure I was under, my moral compass took a wild spin and left me just toeing the line, trying to survive until the next day. He was desperate for money, as he was facing eviction, and I did not know how to help him. I was told to keep him on a leash with talk about the promised basic income, but as time went on it was clear they were not going to give it to him for the work he was doing. I remember being in a meeting with him and trying to come up with a good lie to keep him participating while Dakota and Lila listened in just out of sight of my camera.

At some point we had a visitor to the headquarters. His name was Jai-El, and both Awen and I had surreal experiences with this man, who had profound stories to tell about his mystical experiences. There was one time we were heading back up to Carmen Hall and we sensed something was waiting for us around the corner. When we eventually turned, there he was, and he began asking questions about Earth Nation in his powerful deep voice. We felt a connection with him at this moment and opened up about how we were feeling. He listened patiently to us, then said that this was not the project he wanted to be involved with. He left the next day, but that would not be the last we would hear from him.

If it were all work and no play, then I certainly would have reached my breaking point sooner. But, there were always events going on that relieved some of the stress and allowed us to have some fun with our new family. Some of them I felt were a waste of time as I was pressured to keep working on the mountain of tasks I had, but there were others that really grabbed me. One of which was a DMT ceremony.

We sat in a circle in Indigo Hall, the other dorm where only Dakota and Lila stayed, and a pipe was passed around. I remember feeling as though I was weightless, My perception of self expanded outwards to encompass the entire room. At some point, the door was opened, and this sensation expanded beyond the bounds of the room. It felt like I was in connection with the trees outside, and I felt a weight being removed from my chest. Afterwards, we went right back to work, and I was excited to sink my teeth into the pile of work I had waiting for me.

Sometime during the two months we were at Triangle Lake, we were introduced to the board of directors. These were people who had nothing to do with Earth Nation outside of their agreements for them to use the land and buildings for their project. They were really sweet people with hearts of gold but in hindsight were clearly being taken advantage of by this predatory organization.

A lot of discrepancies started to pop up when we first started to get to know the board of directors in person. For instance, we discovered it was in their agreements that no smoking or drinking was allowed on the property. This was a shock to us, but we continued smoking due to the peer pressure that made it common. Perhaps more importantly, we discovered things like how Dakota was clearly lying about the value of the property they did not even own, as we were originally told. He made it seem like they had complete property rights to an eleven million dollar plot of land, when in reality they were leasing it and it was worth roughly two million at most.

Even more important was when we discovered that Dakota and Lila were offering them a large sum of money to be let on the board of directors. When we heard this, it immediately became a point of concern amongst many of the other members of the group. In hindsight, this was all planned as a means to control us further. A subgroup of heart-centered individuals formed which juxtaposed the technology-centered individuals. We felt more in tune with the former, while all the resentment we were harboring was then focused on the latter group.

It wasn’t long before the board began talking with us about the misguidings of Dakota and Lila. Naturally, this led to the heart-centric individuals talking amongst themselves about what to do and how badly misguided the project was. Awen and I finally felt justified in expressing our feelings, to which we were fed more well-constructed lies to keep us onboard for a little longer while feeling like we were making changes within the organization so that we would not have to deal with this treatment anymore. For instance, Daniella told us she heard Dakota referring to his workers in STADA as “dirty little Indians,” which obviously caused a lot of pushback from the group of heart-centered members.

Soon after, during a morning meeting, we were told there was an anti-gossip rule being put in place. Dakota made it his business to ensure the business of Earth Nation was kept in meetings where the opinions of others could be controlled. It didn’t work, as I remember many nights where we would huddle together and smoke in the back of the kitchen discussing the events of the day and what we learned from them.

In the moment, it appeared like we were starting to split off from the main group and form a completely separate group. In hindsight, this was obviously all planned. In order to completely rewin our loyalty, they tricked us into believing that we were distancing ourselves from all the problems we were experiencing and starting anew.

Near Christmas, we traveled to a healer who worked with Elton John and stayed a few nights. Here, we would get on a call with Dakota and Lila and split off entirely. It was a mess. They claimed to have paid me upwards of $7,200, when in reality I had nothing but their worthless cryptocurrency to show for two months of work.

We felt empowered and again ready to take on the world. Daniella was there to support us, and with her motherly wisdom we were sure that whatever came next, whatever it may be, we would be ready for it.

But we were not immediately ready for our departure. We still had a lot of preparation to do back at the Circle of Children. We had yet to officially sever connection with Earth Nation, and Daniella had a plan to take back a little bit of money we were owed. She submitted a proposal for her project, Lovecycle, for cleaning and getting Triangle Lake back in order before we left, as everyone else had abandoned the location leaving a mess.

It didn’t work. After a week of backbreaking work, leaving the facilities better than when we found them, we were told no one should be paid for doing the bare minimum of work that was expected of us. This was the final straw and served as the final confrontation between us and Earth Nation.

ShrugLifeSyndicate,fjhjng8,t3_fdezfb,1583349412.0,"Q. What are you currently experiencing, and What are your reactions, and also What are your loved one's reactions?

A. I'm experiencing a mixture of joy and frustration. I'm joyous because I just found out that I got awarded SSI benefits and I'm frustrated because I am still a ways away from even getting a new ID, thanks to being homeless. I'm fairly neutral, all things considered. Today is just another day. My father appears to be very happy for me.

Q. How long have you been experiencing this in a way that is negatively impacting your life, and have you, or someone you know experienced something similar before?

A. Since I became homeless, I became acutely aware of how dense ""the system"" is and its bulkiness only serves to make it more difficult for me to move forward with my life. I suppose everyone who has experienced homelessness has these same feelings as it feels like we're getting ground up into dust by the machinery which makes the world run.

Q. What are your longterm goals here, and what are your short term goals here?

A. Where is here? I can only assume you mean the SLS, to which I must answer that I am cultivating myself while trying to have a positive impact on the world.

Q. What generally makes you happy?

A. Juggling. To expand on that, feeling like I am personally succeeding at something which is wholly unique to me. I've worked hard to make myself as novel of a juggler as possible and seeing those results means a lot to me.

Q. When you feel In Control what is that personally like, what do you believe causes you to feel with or without Control in a situation?

A. I feel in control when I have attained some mastery with a particular skillset. As such, when I juggle or write, I feel in control and I believe this a natural reaction to having some sense of stability in one's environment."

Well you're doing it! I'm sorry to hear about your ear condition. I often think about what would happen if I lost functionality of my hands and what that would mean for my juggling. I used to get really paranoid about my legs when I ran track too. It makes me appreciate what I have and how lucky I am. Yet, in more recent years I've reached a state where I know I'd be alright if something were to happen. Something about becoming homeless and losing it all had given me new perspective on myself and my attachments. You seem to understand the same shrug philosophy but naturally will still struggle with wanting things to be the way they were. I still think back to how life was before my fall and miss the simpler times. Let yourself feel the loss but get back up stronger than you were before. Likewise, forgive yourself for little transgressions such as smoking weed. Work towards your goals of sobriety but don't punish yourself for giving in to your natural cravings. It makes life easier when you love yourself that way.
