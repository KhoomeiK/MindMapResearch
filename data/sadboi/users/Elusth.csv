This isn't true though. Financial gain for some publishers is up, but the divide between consumers and devs, both indie and AAA, is up. Nothing harbors distrust like kickstarter backers getting refused refunds, or developers mocking players because they aren't satisfied with the state of EGS."

I don't like their approach to improving their industry, and I don't like being forced to use a shitty launcher, therefor I won't be buying games there.

Security shouldn't even be notifying you about fraudulent log in attempts, and you can read up on the plethora of unfortunate souls who lost their epic accounts both with and without two-step verification 

>From my own experience.

>People easily rallied to a cause based on bullshit...

Yeah this is kinda the problem, you see people who are mad and automatically conclude that its the typical **gamer rage**. Maybe try and look for a bit and see that sometimes the vocal minority grows and criticizes something that is genuinely worth criticizing. 

Like I said though, you can be okay with the issues, but please don't associate me with the scum that cry about ""feminism forced into games"" and send death threats to devs.

To expand on the security...

It's bad. Blizzard might be worse as you claim, but that doesn't mean you should be happy with it. If you shop on EGS, security should be a concern"
Gamingcirclejerk,f18znzs,t1_f18yatf,1569265764.0,"Almost none of the features found in launchers like steam and gog, and it even falters in comparison to origin, uplay, twitch, and discord.

The security is terrible, friends who have put in payment information get dozens of log in attempts from foreign contries DESPITE having enabled two-step verification. 

Epic's practice of exclusivivity starves the industry of competition and is solely there to benefit publishers and shareholders. Forcing 3rd party games onto an inferior platform is anti-consumer, no question about it.
