If you buy lots of video games and only play the first hour... Well now your paying a shit ton of money for something that's not adding entertainment value to your life.

- let him take care of himself. And if he fails, let him fail. Let him learn from his failure. Or let him come to you and ask for help. 

- write down all the chores you do and he does on a paper or on a document and show him. Ask him for help, tell him you are overwhelmed and let him figure out his own schedule. 

- stop asking him to do things now. Schedule him to do things by the end of the week or by a dead line (not today). 

My partner and are are living a little better with the steps above, but we also decided he would take on more monetary duties and pay for more things. Over all this has lead to a lot less resentment on my part and I am happy to do the things to keep the house clean without him partaking."

I got an art degree right out of highschool. Realized my art was too shit to get the job, realized I didn't want the art job and wasn't that passionate about it. Got some random medical job instead that paid well and doing shift work. Realized I liked working night shifts. Realized I hate working 40 hours a week. Realized I do well in very short bursts of high stress situations and really badly in long drawn out stressful situations (project management like stuff). Realized I don't want to make my life about my career, and I need to see the direct impact my job has on people around me. 

So I'm going to school for nursing. Plan to graduate and work part time. I get to see the effects my work have first hand. I get to go home and not think about work. I can make enough money and get benefits part time and work nights. 

Really analysing the life I wanted to live was helpful. To be happy I knew I needed to be less stressed, I'm very anxious person. So I figured out what made me anxious and what didn't and am headed down that path. My family was smart with money and taught me to be the same. I still need to work to make money, but I saved enough to pay for school the second time. Then once I'm out I will only work enough to sustain the modest life style I desire."

It's complicated. Now I have to sit here and really consider what I want to do with my life. 

I've decided to go back to school for nursing and then spend the rest of life working part time probably. So maybe I'm less interested in FIRE now. I've learned a lot and really gotten time to consider what I need in life to make me happy. The big the was I just didn't want to work full time.  The nursing career is one I can work part time with benefits, while being fulfilling (my last job was medical as well and I realized I really liked it), and I can live off the part time salary. If life ever gets complicated I can work OT, and there's a variety of nursing professions so if I don't like one job I can try for a different type of nursing. Plus I can work the job anywhere in America when my partner FIREs and we decide to move. It'll give me community and purpose. 

So now I'm not really looking to FIRE anymore I guess. I don't mind working, I just never wanted to work 40 hour weeks. But going for FIRE made this choice possible."

Last week he brought me home marshmallows in a cup. I laughed and told him I really appreciate the thought but I'm simply not into marshmallows.

He brought up another moment, I corrected him again. That it was never the marshmallows that made me happy, it was that he thought of me and was always so kind that made me happy.
