GriefSupport,fpbc2pt,t3_gce133,1588466623.0,"I am so sorry for your loss. I lost my dad in December 2019 to pneumonia/ARDS so the way you described all this made me realize I wasn’t the only one that when through this. I was with him when he took his last breath. You never forget it....ugh. My heart hurts as does yours. We played Pink Floyd at his memorial as it was his favorite band of all time, he was 59. If you ever need to chat feel free to message me. I have changed as a person also.  I’m not really me anymore. I’m crying as I write this. Take care of yourself."

GriefSupport,fjfh3th,t3_fd3kmj,1583291678.0,"I am crying with you. I lost my dad to cancer in December, it’s been almost 3 months and I’m still bitter as fuck about some times and just sad about everything else. I’m so sorry you have lost your Nan, I wish I could hug you! I hope each day your chest and shoulders may loosen and you can once again breathe. I know right now it feels like you won’t ever be able to breathe again but you will....you will for Nan!! Whatever happens throughout your day just remember she loves (present tense, cause her love will never change) you and would want you to shine in her memory. Shine bright so she can see just how beautiful you are! ❤️"
