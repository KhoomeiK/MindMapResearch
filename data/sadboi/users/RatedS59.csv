mentalillness,fqelk66,t1_fqefbq0,1589309567.0,I hope u r 18 soon...but for now sweet girl...call the hotline...I mean...why not? They could help u thru the hardest of times...I certainly am not a professional...just have a lot of experience in life (I‚Äôm old...lol). I don‚Äôt know quite how to give u my info as I started writing before I thought of it...but I will figure that out...I‚Äôll be back in touch shortly...u hang in there...there is a life for u out there...believe it...I DO!!!!!
mentalillness,fqeb3jm,t3_gi9nh4,1589304653.0,Me again...I just read the other posts...looks like we are all in agreement...totally agree with the person that said if u have dreams then u have reasons to LIVE!!!!!!
mentalillness,fqeaph7,t3_gi9nh4,1589304476.0,"I do not feel at all that I have wasted my time reading ur post...may I ask how old u r? Reason being if u r 18 I would say get the hell away from ur Mom and Dad!!! And rekindle ur dreams!!! Because the only one u can change is you!!! U cannot change them...I am 61 yrs old now and it took me a long time to realize that it was me that I could change not the people around me...u also should learn that being around negative peeps makes u negative...
I don‚Äôt want u to die!!! Please don‚Äôt give up!!!! There are options out there and you have the ULTIMATE RIGHT TO BE HAPPY AND HEALTHY...
Please do not apologize for letting others read ur post...we are glad u did and maybe there will be something in a post that helps!!!!"
mentalillness,fo5b3o7,t3_g5od4z,1587521467.0,"I wish I had the magic words to help you but unfortunately I don‚Äôt...your story is a nightmare and I wish I could just grab u up and keep u safe but we both know that‚Äôs not possible...but what is possible is for u to continue to ask for help and be honest about what u need and are feeling...if the meds r not working thru the night tell them so...I can relate to your dreams as mine are extremely violent and dark...
I wish you the best and certainly are due for some extreme goodness in your life...üíúüññüèºüíú"
democrats,fo59b8e,t1_fo2qaf9,1587520324.0,THAT WOULD BE SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL!!!!
democrats,fl7shl6,t3_fn1vgq,1584908425.0,I would say unbelievable but we all know Barr is as crooked as Trump!!!! We need our constitutional rights NOW MORE THAN EVER!!!!
mentalillness,fib3q3p,t3_f77ksl,1582313993.0,"My Grandson has schizophrenia too but is really adamant that he doesn‚Äôt...I believe it is from the stigma of mental illness...I suffer from depression and anxiety myself and I take meds to help...lord only knows how crazy I would be without meds...I try to tell him it‚Äôs just a disease...just like I am diabetic...I take meds for that...it‚Äôs the same thing...I stop talking about him going to a psychiatrist as it seemed to upset him and make him defensive...I love him so and worry about him all the time...
Have u been diagnosed? Cause he has not...he has been in and out of psych wards and all the hospital wants is to get them out ASAP...probably only saw the Dr once maybe twice...any advise?
I think it‚Äôs wonderful that u don‚Äôt feel the stigma & are willing to deal with it openly. It‚Äôs a disease just like any other disease. We have sooo many people dealing with mental health and nobody seems to care??!!"
NoStupidQuestions,fc9sqq6,t3_egt2bz,1577557659.0,I‚Äôm ambidextrous so I sleep on both sides...but mainly on right side...but I am left handed for writing mainly but can‚Äôt really write so well with right hand but can do most anything else with either hand...strange huh?
NoStupidQuestions,fc9rpva,t3_egpivu,1577557213.0,Very interesting question...I was born in 1959 in FL...so not really the 50‚Äôs...but I know that color was everywhere when I was growing up...some were beautiful but some such as Harvest Gold & Avocado Green were way ugly but were mega used for appliances!!!
mentalillness,fc9qnw1,t3_egrwi1,1577556743.0,I know it was a tough decision to make but I certainly think you r headed in the right direction!!!! GOOD LUCK to you!!!!!
mentalillness,fbt2xi9,t3_ee76ff,1577066888.0,"Thank you, this gives me hope that he will want help at some point...I do believe he knows something is wrong he just isn‚Äôt ready to commit to treatment..."
mentalillness,fbsj8m1,t1_fbr5lzy,1577055985.0,"He has both delusions & hallucinations...he is also very paranoid...he will not go see a Dr because he does not believe he has a mental health disease...he is trying to help himself in writing, meditation etc. I have tried to explain what I think many times but I no longer do this because it was counter productive. I just try to listen without opinion...I want him to know how much I love him as it is the only thing I can truly do...he has to want to help himself before he can get help...I know this but wish I could help him..."
