How is this not policing? How is this not making their appearance the be all and end all?*

Perhaps I should expand....I said by *societal* standards in the States, they would be considered white. Meaning that this is from s*ociety's view in the US* and more than likely, this would create a situation of reflecting on what that means for them in the *US and other environments that heavily enforce the western standard*. Obviously, looking white is a privilege in the United States and Western society. I even said that's not the *only* factor to consider and it depends on location and context. 

*They have one fully black great grandparent, two fully black great great grandparents who were both born into slavery. Is someone with four great great grandparents more “black” than they? Is a full black person more black than a half black person? To me this seems reminiscent of Plessy vs Ferguson and the 1/8th rule. Wouldn’t you agree? The same would hold true for a black child raised in a white family. Is this child less black than a black child raised in a black home? I hope you don’t think I’m trying to debate you. This is the last thing I want and would really like to try and see all sides of this discussion.*

1. Who is ""they"" you are referring to?
2. I'm not attempting to re-create the PvF rule nor the ODR rule by any means, I'm just saying that identity is circumstantial and it depends on the lens one is looking through because how racial/ethnic identity is determined in the US is different from other countries and the **US is really the only country that still enforces ODR based on race alone.**
3. *""Is someone with four great great grandparents more “black” than they? Is a full black person more black than a half black person?""* Are you referring to ""black"" in terms of ancestry DNA, appearance/phenotype here?
4. In the context you provided, they would be considered racially black and racially white by most in the United States, depending on one's appearance.
5. ""Race is biological as 23 and me and dna proves that"". You're thinking of ethnicity/ancestry, not race.

*I hope you don’t think I’m trying to debate you. This is the last thing I want and would really like to try and see all sides of this discussion.*

Perhaps, but how you are wording it can give indication of it otherwise, along with your line of questioning (i.e., ""isn't that policing"") . To protect my energy, you can chose to further this discussion via DM if you mean it, but I am ending it here."
23andme,fqury54,t1_fquqh3v,1589663672.0,"I’m saying that there are a combination of factors to consider *besides* appearance when it comes to identity. The appearance portion shouldn’t be the ""end all, be all"" to policing someone when you don’t know them or their upbringing (general note, *not you as in specifically you*).

In the case you provided, if they pass as white, obviously they will be treated as such and will have to recognize their privilege in Western society, especially in the US. This is a societal factor, and although important, it’s not the only factor.

You would have to provide more information if you choose, but again, it depends on the situation at hand."
