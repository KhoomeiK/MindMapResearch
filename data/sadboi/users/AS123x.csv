for hair, take a similar quiz to find your hair type, and look up some brands that work well for your hair type (shampoo, conditioner, etc). when the salons open back up, find one with good reviews and talk to them about what cuts and styles would flatter you. at the end of the day though, go with whatever hairstyle you like.

WitchesVsPatriarchy,fpkrxbn,t3_ge20cp,1588699983.0,"A friend of mine received a gorgeous tarot deck for his birthday last November, and offered to do readings for all of us at his party. I asked the deck to tell me how my 2020 would go, and this is the reading I got.

I looked up the general meaning of each card, since I’m not as well versed in tarot as my friend. The reading has come true and it amazes me. 

Three of Stars- Through January and February I was seeing a psychiatrist and working on my mental illness (bipolar II and generalized anxiety disorder). Through some trial and error, we found the right medications and the right dosage. It was incredibly difficult to unlearn destructive coping mechanisms, but I improved little by little. At the same time, my workload at work ramped up, and I had to work harder than ever to make sure I didn’t fall behind. 

Five of Swords- I started working from home in mid-March, to follow my state’s shelter-in-place order. Not being able to see my coworkers and friends had caused me to backslide a lot. A lot of my depressive symptoms returned and I was struggling. However, I discussed it with my psychiatrist and we’re working towards improvement. 

Six of Stars- this part of my reading hasn’t happened yet, but I know it will come. I look forward to what’s to come.

King of Cups- Despite my struggles and setbacks, the medication I’m on for my bipolar II and GAD have gives me a much more stable foundation to stand on. My anxiety is so much less now, and I’m not longer having hypomanic episodes. I know that as the year goes on, things will get better again, and I’ll end the year on a positive note. 

If anyone had an interpretation of my reading to add, please feel free!"

I took an anti-nausea pill (anesthesia can make some people nauseated) and they put me in a state called “twilight” which makes you feel really relaxed and a little giddy. I remember wanting to say “wheee!” when they pushed my bed around a corner to the OR. The last thing I remember was scooting over from my bed to the operating table. Boom, I was just out. Waking up was like blinking. I went from 9 am to 1 pm instantaneously. I woke up in the recovery room feeling a little groggy, but okay. I chatted with some nurses and after a few minutes they wheeled me back to my room. I was very alert and lucid for the rest of the day, but my appetite was nonexistent. Total experience was incredibly easy and smooth, no problems at all. If you’re feeling anxious, talk to your nurses. They’ve seen it all and can reassure you. 

I hope this helps! Best of luck!"
