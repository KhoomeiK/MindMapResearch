Anxiety,fq4s3pp,t3_fj2y1a,1589082856.0,"So some personal good news. I work in a small pharmacy as a cashier. Since shit really hit the fan there’s been a drop in the amount of people coming in per day, which was expected. Today though, we were the busiest we’ve been in months. The really nice part about it is we hardly filled or sold many prescriptions today. Along with the prescriptions and otc medicine that’s there, we have a a room full of hallmark cards. People weren’t buying them when shit was bad. So we closed off the room so that people would only come in for prescriptions. Friday though we took a tiny little shelf and grabbed all the Mother’s Day cards we had in the store and put them in the front so that customers could buy them. Shelf probably had about 150 cards on it total. Between Friday and today we sold every single Mother’s Day card we put out. Nearly everyone who came in today bought a card. That’s the reason we were so busy. I love it for 2 reasons. 1) it’s so nice to see so many people who appreciate the mothers in their lives. 2) It was 40 degrees or so today during a pandemic and people still came in to get something that’s not necessarily needed, but something that shows appreciation for someone. Warms my god damn heart. This worlds still got a chance guys. Anyone who tells you nothing’s gonna be the same, or something along the lines of this virus is shining a light on people’s cruelty. Show them this, and shut them up."

Seems inevitable that one of Harry’s children wouldn’t be able to handle the pressure of being a potter. Every mistake he makes, becomes a constant reminder of how great his dad was. If the kids screws up a lot he learns to hate the mention of his fathers name and his accomplishments. I think that pretty easily result in a rift in their relationship. Although Harry saying something like that is out of character. But you think about it, the kid who grew up being abused without loving parents at home.

It may be because I’m scared it might be because I’ve felt extremely fatigued today and just out of it like I’m sick (no fever, no cough, still can taste and smell). I’ve also been shaking today haha that ones a new fresh feeling. Shit taking me for a damn ride oh my god. But I’m really frustrated rn. I’m frustrated because these feelings won’t go away. I’m frustrated cause I go to work more than 3 times a week and I don’t want to because I don’t want to get sick but I like money. Along with the realization that At some point I’m probably gonna get this virus, and die due to my year and a half of nicotine consumption, I’ve come to the realization that I’m am severely unprepared for a global disaster like this. I don’t have any understanding of how to go on with these kinds of thing happening. Keep in mind I’ve lived a very mild mannered life so far. The worst thing that’s ever happened during my life was the attacks on 9/11 in 2001, and I was a year old I don’t remember it. The current disaster I mean holy shit this is what it feels like going through something like this? My god this is scary. On top of that it pisses me off that no one in power, no one on tv holding news conferences cares about people like me. We’re switched to online school our education losing our quality of learning, we’re sheltered inside with the sounds of chaos non stop outside, for me it’s getting guilted into working more days than usual risking exposure because other employees are high risk and can’t come in. I mean I’m happy to fill in, it’s what needs to be done but while their bodies won’t be able to handle the virus, my mind can’t take the worrying anymore. I’m stuck in this situation where I’m basically asking to be infected, and I can’t get out of it because it’s not the right thing to do. I just want this to be over I want life back to normal. I want someone important to tell me with certainty that my life isn’t on the brink of ending. I haven’t come to terms with the thought of death yet. I feel so vulnerable. Like I’m a dead man walking."

We stay home to protect those at high risk. When a case hit my town I told my grandparents stay inside I’ll get you anything you need.

But if millions are willing to stay home to protect them then why can’t we keep working and millions band together to help the high risk people quarantined for their protection.

Although there is that voice in the back of my head that’s like there’s so many varying cases, and the potential for me to land in the hospital hooked up to machines, fighting for my life is high. I mean I’m 19 male with no underlying health conditions, aside from the vaping, and I’m scared this shit is 100% gonna kill me. I’m wearing masks, gloves washing my hands. My small little town in New Jersey only has 30 cases. Problem is I cant time up my symptoms because I work in a pharmacy so I’m leaving the house fairly often. Last week I felt like I had a fever, and it hasn’t come back since that day. My parents keep saying they don’t think I really had one and it was just anxiety. This week dry coughing like 2 times every 4 hours or so. I don’t feel the need to cough I was just doing it because I felt like I had something in my throat. Then I go to work yesterday and feel totally fine and as soon as a I get home, the tickle in my throat gets worse and goes from hardly coughing at all to 1-2 coughs every hour. So cough basically went from practically non existent to hardly mild. Today cough is back to practically non existent. Forget about the shortness or breath My anxiety has been making me feel it since last month before my town or any of the surrounding towns even had a case. Oddly though I haven’t felt it yet today but I feel odd chest pressure. Just going back and forth between I have it and now I’m a week away from going to the ICU, or maybe I don’t have it and I’m just worrying, even maybe if I get it it will just be mild and I can go back to life after what feels like a normal illness. Really losing it though mentally. The point is your post eased my mind a little bit. Can I ask what you vape, and how often just to compare with my own habits."

Do you remember watching or seeing anything bad about his defense back then? Of course not because it was a non issue. The concussion he suffered has most likely caused impairments to his vision. Unfortunately it’s probably permanent. It’s possible he can make adjustments to his new normal, but it takes time and practice. It’s also very possible that his impairments will have a permanent effect on his ability to track a ball in which case he can’t be a serviceable fielder. In that case no amount of practice will get him back to where he was. It’s also possible that with time his impairments will go away and he’ll be back to where he was. What’s important to note is the criticism he receives now for being a bad fielder is false and unwarranted. With no impairments he’d be a decent fielder. It’s simply just a repercussion of an unfortunate injury, and there may be no way of fixing it."

NJTech,fj05kg8,t3_faiiuk,1582889946.0,"I don’t really have anything to compare it too. One friend who’s at Clemson (he doesn’t study architecture) has told me his friend that is an arch major is constantly bogged down by work. He described it as a “no life major”. Another friend I have who is an arch major at I think Kent state has also described to me the mountains of work he had to complete. I hope you already knew it’s a demanding major, just letting you know it’s no different at NJIT. You’ll have lots of long days and nights (I’ve spent 14 hours consecutively working on a project). Studios are kind of bland and dated (Not sure when but I remember hearing they’re gonna refurbish them soon). Some studios are large and you have limited space to work but plenty of space to move around which is good. Other studios are smaller than high school classrooms, so sometime it’s feels very cramped with a possible 6-14 other people in there. A lot of kids change majors or drop out of school in the first semester cause they either can’t handle it or the major wasn’t what they thought it’d be. There’s also the other scenario where what’s known as a critic (basically your instructor who publicly critiques your work during presentations) completely disparages and destroys a kids interest in the major. That’s kinda of the point of first year. Most critics are incredibly tough on students during feedback because they’re trying to weed out the weak ones or the ones who truly don’t really have an interest for it. Every project is a learning step up as well as a test. They’ll test your creativity, your efficiency, your thoroughness, your effort, and your grit. The people in your studio can be very helpful and also they can be your downfall. I’ve had kids help me solve and issue that was preventing me from finishing a project. I’ve also had a kid who caused me to fail a project because they refused to help with the work. You will laugh, YOU WILL CRY, you will get discouraged, you will heavily consider giving up. Your critic may recommend that you change your major. If your are passionate about the field the important thing is to never fucking give up and never give in to what other people say. No matter your grade, no matter what your critic tells you never give in if this is something you really wanna do. If you’re on the fence, figure it out early in the semester what you wanna do. Another thing is this is how I personally feel other people feel differently and will tell you differently. Your health is 1 million times more important than any studio project. This is just my recommendation, never pull an all nighter to finish a project. Sleep is more crucial. If you make the decision to sleep on a project early enough in the day chances are you can get up early enough in the morning to have enough time to finish with a refreshed mind. Lastly you may hate your critic, but it’s important to know they aren’t super villains. everything they say and everything they do is meant to help you whether it be finding a new major or a longer guideline to finish a project. They may seem cruel but in reality they are instructing you in the best way they see fit. Every single one of them knows what they’re talking about. If they tell you something you don’t wanna hear or don’t like hearing, consider the possibility they could either be testing you or giving you their honest opinion. Above all always respect what they have to say. I hope that’s enough info for you. If you decide to go forward with the major all I have to say is welcome to hell, you’ll be here at least 4-5 years. But you know have fun in the burning abyss that is architecture school."

Redskins,fdkqnx7,t3_elt2a1,1578509139.0,"This is gonna get downvoted, but I hope people can respect my opinion. I feel this is the wrong move. If the plan isn’t to fully commit to Haskins than at the least it should be his job to lose. A 22 year old constantly looking over to the sideline worried his replacement is gonna start warming up. Are we really expecting someone to perform at a high level with that kind of pressure. To add to that point, where is the line? Is Rivera gonna turn elsewhere if Haskins is mediocre. A lot of you were ok with Alex smith and he is the epitome of mediocre. Hypothetically speaking if that scenario plays out I predict a lot of people in the sub will say it’s the right move to pull Haskins. Onto another point how is it alright for Rivera to bring in all his Carolina staff, and a lot of people are fine with it because they want riverboat to be comfortable. Yet Haskins is void of  basically all aspects of comfortability apart from his receiving core being the same. Shouldn’t we either be also not committing to Ron Rivera or affording Haskins the same level of comfort that Ron has gotten. Both are gonna be central to this teams success. Rn the way I see it there should be a lot of players on trial rn. Haskins I don’t think should be one of them him, terry, and guice (when he played) were the bright spots of this team last season. That central core could be disgusting if a lot of moving parts come together. But these 3 players should be afforded comfortability so they have room to flourish.

StarWars,fbg0cui,t3_ed67vc,1576828147.0,"I’m upset with no Anakin force ghost, but I think this movie was fantastic. I think Adam Driver and JJ really did justice to Kyle Ren/Ben Solo. His redemption was perfect. The Han memory. Lots of people seem to think he was gonna say “I love you” I think he was about to say “I’m sorry”. What a way to show the regret and emotion to a heavily conflicted and manipulated character. Incredibly raw and emotional scene. 

I wasn’t a fan of palpatine coming back in full living form. I was hoping for a ghost like presence. With what we got I absolutely loved it. The prequels tried to show just how powerful this man was, and I think they failed in doing that. This movie really did a good job at showing this guys is one bad motherfucker in inconceivable ways. Hats off for that. They made it work. 

Rey being a palpatine I’m mean holy shit that’s fucking insane. I’m kinda at a loss for words as to what to say about that. I feel like they could’ve explored that history in her more with her fear of turning to the dark side being in her nature. We did get her destroying the training device and damaging BB8, then “killing chewy”, and the vision or whatever it was of her as a master of the dark side. I feel like all these things happened right in front of me, but I still missed what was going through her head until she saw herself in those shoes. I might be just an idiot for that, but more honesty and exploration of this feeling she has would’ve been awesome. 

Poe dameron and Finn are such a great duo to see. We don’t know much about either of their backstories (Finn doesn’t even know shit about himself) but yet the mystery with both there characters past combined with what we see in The trilogy is excellent for both of them. Both valiant smart fighters with compassion and interest. 

The ending was powerful. Palpatine having the support as a man kept alive by machines, the mystery characters in the crowd (so curious as to what that was), the plan to indulge Rey to strike him down, the regain of his full form, fucking lighting up an entire sky with just straight power, and the fight against impossible odds in the sky. I mean people might be angry with the endgame inspired save, but let’s be honest with ourselves we wanted this inspiring feel good type thing. That’s what makes these movies so enjoyable. The success in banding together, the good feelings it brings to us, the joy we get from seeing such tyranny and disgusting actions falling apart. You just can’t go wrong with it. The life force thing was interesting I’d just like to say again palpatine is a bad motherfucker. Bens redemption to me is like a more through version of Vader’s. Vader saved his son spoke to him and was then dead but saved from his own suffering. Ben was saved used many actions to help save his friend/GF/Wife i don’t fucking know, and went peacefully redeemed in his heinous deeds and the best part is we got to see more of it and him as Ben solo as the good guy just fantastic. Something I really wanted out of the film and it was delivered. The kiss well, it was cringy, but I get it they had a deep and powerful connection. I could’ve done without or with it I don’t really care that much about it

Rey was fantastic I wish she didn’t hide her fear of turning to the dark in this movie specifically but that’s my biggest gripe and it’s small in my eyes. I really wish she was using her own lightsaber in this movie although the reveal of Leias and the subsequent reveal of Luke training her was amazing (that scene with them sparring as their younger selves my god I almost cried. The voices coming to her I couldn’t make out a lot of them except anakins (cause I was listening for it) was such a nice touch would’ve loved to see all those people as force ghosts I mean final movie might as well go big with it but I’m still content

Overall fantastic movie and great way to end the story I grew up with loving so much. It leaves me wanting to see more and that’s such a good thing in my eyes. I don’t want it to be over because I want to see everything, but sadly we can’t be witness to these characters lives. I love this community fan base everything it’s been a wild ride everybody I hope all fans were able to get something out of this journey we’ve been taken on."

NJTech,f4k7hm7,t1_f4k3tqf,1571638641.0,"I. D.o.n.t want to inject people into a topic they aren’t comfortable with, or force people to take any sides. I just want to create a place for students to speak on politics, and make sure that those that may have political interest are introduced into the fray with the correct knowledge. Also for those that do vote or partake in some political discussion, but don’t know much about it are aware enough to make an informed voting decision."

NJTech,f4jnxfz,t1_f4gi0ec,1571622998.0,"That’s exactly the reason I want to start this organization. I understand the whole “I just wanna graduate” thing. I myself am the same way. I felt the political atmosphere at school was incredibly lacking, and I think it’s important for everybody to be politically aware. We are the the now and the future. It’s crucial for us to make our voices heard. When we’re doing that though we should also be properly informed on the issues we are voting for."
NJTech,f4ea0sc,t1_f4e7j4t,1571554562.0,"Perfect, I can ask around a few people see if their interested. I think we’re better off starting a branch of a broader network rather than a single organization. So I’ve been researching the capabilities of starting a chapter on tpusa.com (turning point USA). If you don’t know what that is, it’s basically a organization who’s mission is to spread conservative ideas to young people like us all over the country. There’s chapter of the organization at different colleges around the country. I contacted them for info about potentially starting one our school. See what they say in a few days. If it doesn’t work out, can always start our own independent kind of thing."

NJTech,f4dftme,t1_f4cp7xy,1571542046.0,"I don’t think it’s contradictory in the case of the context. I’ve only been here for a month and there’s definitely no open political discussion, and nothing is shoved in the face of anybody which is a really good thing. However based on the op’s experience and my own. (Few days ago in my studio every one the of kids were talking and saying “there’s no way the president can get re-elected right?”) it seems there’s an underlying, quiet, but widespread support for liberalism around the school. While it may be a one sided idea, I think it’s appropriate to start a clubs based on a conservative way of think so like minded people can feel like they aren’t alone in their thinking. I’ve looked at the list of clubs an organizations on campus it seemed the left side was adequately represented so it seems appropriate for the right side to have a place on campus as well."

Redskins,f1pudo1,t3_dahycn,1569688295.0,"Definitely the Alex Smith trade. What happened with RG3 was unfortunate, but the trade was made for the future, to grab a franchise QB. The intentions were 100% there, and in the correct mindset. The Alex Smith acquisition was a quick fix to a huge problem. Where in turn they also created 2 more giant problems with it (EX: we don’t have a CB and we have to keep Smiths contract and he’s never gonna play again)"

Redskins,f1go53n,t3_d94g3b,1569472197.0,Smith was useless aside from his rookie year. The Kendall fuller trade was mentally retarded before Alex smith got hurt. Should’ve resigned breeland after he failed his physical with the panthers.

StrangerThings,ewijt7v,t3_c90a1a,1565450782.0,"If the kids theory that they locked part of the mindflayer in their world when closing the gate is true, what exactly was it that months later during the summer reactivated the mindflayer. Was he dormant during that time.  Was he active, but lifeless had no purpose with the gate closed? Was it the Russians opening the gate in Hawkins to the upside down that reconnected the mindflayer to consciousness? I’m confused on how just one random day in the summer the mindflayer is active again.

Edit: also the scene of will destroying Castle Beyers, realizing his childhood and is friends are slipping away is the saddest and most relatable certain tragedy as part of growing up."
