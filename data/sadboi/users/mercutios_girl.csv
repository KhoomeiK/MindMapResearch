Period underwear may indeed help. But I would steer clear or the synthetic ones (Knix, Thinx) bad go for organic cotton ones (Lunapads) instead. The synthetic ones don’t breathe well, and may be treated with chemical agents that can harm you (there was an investigation into this, neither Knix or Thinkx have responded adequately or turned over their products for third-party independent testing, so I would be wary). 

You could also consider washable organic cotton liners; again, more breathable and safer for you, better for the planet.
