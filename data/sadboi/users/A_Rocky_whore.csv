Using a straight tight stitch setting and medium tension

Wash and dry the fabric on the hottest setting possible, iron on the interfacing. Finish the short edges. Fold the finished edges with the right sides together so that the edges slightly overlap in the middle. Sew down. Fold the mask so it's rightside out. (You can press the edges here but it's not necessary). Try your best to make three equal pleats on each side seam, but the fabric will be hard to manipulate. You don't need to iron these pleats. Sew two seams across each set of pleats, an inch from the edge and half an inch from the edge. 

For the ties, sew the strips into tubes and use a safety pin to flip them. Sew them on each corner extending out from the long end of the mask. 

This is a good pattern because you can add filtration to the pocket. I've seen people cut up house air filters and add them."
