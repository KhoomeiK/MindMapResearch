Gen rushing contains doing the gen right in the killers face while he’s doing things like hooking a survivor or chasing another survivor around the loop the gen is at, and just being extremely coordinated in general. If you have a swf that can tell the others where the killer is at all times gens go by insanely quick. For example a couple days ago I had a game where I did not make any mistakes, got my first hit before the first gen popped, and by the time I hooked the survivor I was chasing 3 gens were done. I went after another survivor and by the time I got done with that chase all the others had finished the other gens and escaped. It wasn’t even an insanely long chase either. It is just very extreme precise coordination that has no counterplay, not so much “genrushing”."

They waste their life on school. Work. People they think care about them. And then die. Go to God knows where. Heaven. Hell. Reincarnation. There is no way to know what follows and that makes it as scary as it is. The fact that the only way to find out is death itself, which everyone fears more than anything. But why?

The new characters that are being released suck and it is hands down the most toxic fan base you will ever see. The best tip I can give you; learn on your own. 99% of it is muscle memory and reactions. Learn which attacks chain together, which combos are viable and which aren’t, what your play style is, ETC. Another thing that I always tell new players is learn the correct punishes for things. That may sound weird but there’s things like getting a heavy from a guardbreak, a light from a parry and a heavy from a light parry, all that stuff. Learn that so you get maximized damage compared to throwing stuff that’s not guaranteed and hoping it lands. I can’t really think of anything else to tell you, if you have a friend who plays hop into a training match with him or if your on Xbox I’d be delighted to teach you.

Like it’s already pussy enough you’re ganking me with 2 s tier characters, and now as soon as I get something that mildly helps me out you just run away like a dog with his tail between his legs. My idea to fix this is that revenge slowly goes down (maybe at half or 1/4 of the rate it does now) and attacks bring the revenge meter down. I don’t see a downside. If people run you can just chase them down and your revenge won’t go away, which makes them stay and fight. My idea isn’t perfect so I’d like to hear some improvements that could be made.
