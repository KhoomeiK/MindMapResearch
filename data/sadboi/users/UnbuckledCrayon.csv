Wow, if i ever get the chance to go to America again i think i‚Äôll look into Chicago or Washington DC then, thank you!

Did you manage to move back home?

Ahh its amazing, its a free roam game where you build up an island and invite villagers to move in. Theres no real aim or goal, instead you just spend time making your island pretty or doing little tasks for the villagers. Its the cutest game i‚Äôve ever played... and while this crazy pandemic is here, its nice to be able to escape from it all tbh. 

I‚Äôm doing well thank you, how are you?

Pardon my ignorance, i‚Äôve been led to believe that milk in tea isnt really a thing outside of the UK. 

Ahhh i getya, must be frustrating when you see things that are dramatised for TV. There are always moments like that in any programme, but i guess they have to jazz it up a bit for the audience. 

Ahh he‚Äôs great, pretty gory books if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into.

I‚Äôve been to a few countries in Europe, none of which are like England at all. Different languages, scenery, culture etc all make it feel like being over the other side of the world for me... plus everyone else drives on the right hand side, which is very strange to me! I‚Äôve been to Florida and honestly that felt more like England than Spain does! Totally different in many ways, but our language and customs/culture are more similar in my opinion. What is it like travelling from state to state?

I understand, and hopefully you won‚Äôt have to stay there for much longer. Are you managing to keep in regular touch with everyone in your household still? Haha well we‚Äôre not too bad as a country tbh. It rains a lot, we drive on the left-hand side of the road, we like going out/staying in and binge-drinking on a weekend (i personally don‚Äôt, but loads of other people do) and we have make amazing chocolate! Also, our tea is made with boiling water and we add milk to it, sometimes sugar too. Not trying to be rude or anything there, i just know that its a very british thing to add milk into tea. Brexit isnt something i‚Äôve ever really followed tbh, i‚Äôm not big on politics. 

Glad to hear that! That‚Äôs must be awful, but unfortunately drastic times make for drastic measures, and drastic measures definitely suck. 

Ooh i‚Äôll have to have a look into that, i like the sound of it! Haha do you point out the factual errors in the programme? There are moments like that in Bones, but its still my guilty pleasure. 

Haha well i suppose they are recognisable, so thanks!

I bet youve read some amazing books then! I love a good murder mystery. Chris Carter did a phenomenal series, really gruesome but truly gripping so i‚Äôd say they were my favourite.

Ahh, how are they holding up? Oh definitely, i think the whole world will have a party when this is all over lol. 

Ahh fair enough, think i‚Äôd struggle watching something like that to be honest. Mr. Robot has a similar plot to fight club with wanting to start a world revolution, but the characters are computer hackers. Its amazing! Ahhh you really should give Bones another go, i‚Äôm hooked.

Yeah definitely. Our prime minister has been tested positive for it now, he was the one telling us to stay safe and away from everyone... oh the irony! That‚Äôs all we can do i think, wait it out n try our hardest to stay safe and healthy. Thanks you, and you too as well!

Ahh that‚Äôs good, i‚Äôm glad you have somewhere to go. Are they able to work, or are they self-isolating atm? Just think about how good the freedom will be when you finally have it back!

Ahh no worries, i fell asleep not long after that anyways. Ahh so ur 4 hours behind then, not as much as i would have thought with you being in a whole other continent. Oooh i‚Äôve never actually seen that, i‚Äôve just finished watching mr robot on prime video, i had my teeth sunk so deep into that!
