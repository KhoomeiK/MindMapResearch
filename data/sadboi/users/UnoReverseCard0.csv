teenagers,fr1lmtr,t1_fr1d3bi,1589821870.0,"Sexuality can be really confusing, especially if your trying to figure yourself out. I still haven‚Äôt completely figured myself out, but that‚Äôs ok. Another thing is you can be straight and asexual! I‚Äôm lesbian and asexual. Romantic attraction and sexual attraction are two very different things!

Asexual is basically lacking or experiencing very little sexual attraction. 

People that do experience sexual attraction are allosexual. 

There are a few main types of attraction: Platonic, aesthetic, romantic, sensual, and sexual.
 
***Platonic*** is basically how you feel to your family and close friends, pretty self explanatory. 

***Aesthetic*** is when you see someone and think ‚ÄúOh, their hot/cute/handsome.‚Äù It means you like someone‚Äôs physical appearance. You can still be asexual and think someone‚Äôs cute/pretty/whatever.

***Sensual*** is where you want to be touched by someone. It‚Äôs not sexual, it‚Äôs more like wanting a hug or cuddles. It can be both romantic (cuddles or hugs from a partner) or platonic (wanting hugs or something from a friend) You can definitely be asexual and experience sensual attraction, I‚Äôm a very sensual person and I *love* my hugs, haha! 

***Romantic*** attraction is the desire to be in a romantic relationship with another person. It‚Äôs different than sexual attraction. This can include sexual attraction, or it may not. It usually is stuff like wanting to be close to your romantic interest, wanting to hold hands, be together, love them, good wholesome stuff like that. Asexuals can experience romantic attraction, but some don‚Äôt. You can still have crushes without sexual attraction. Someone who doesn‚Äôt experience romantic attraction is aromantic, or aro for short. Aromantic people can still experience sexual attraction, but some don‚Äôt. People can be both aromantic and asexual, or aroace for short. They still can feel other types of attraction, though.

***Sexual*** attraction is the desire to have sex with someone. Like you might be watching something like porn and want to be involved or have sex with one of the actors, or you might see someone you like or have a crush on and want to have sex with them. It might be you walking down the street and see someone that you think is hot or something and you wanna have sex with them, or going to a bar to find someone to hook up with. As you can tell, I‚Äôm not entirely sure how it works so those examples might seem a little weird, haha. 

People who are asexual can still get horny, it‚Äôs usually just not directed at or from a person. People who are asexual can still masterbait and enjoy sex, but i‚Äôll get into that in a bit. 

Now, here‚Äôs where it gets a teeny bit confusing: there are many different types of asexuality. 

Asexual, grey-asexual, and demisexual, there‚Äôs more but these are the ones i‚Äôm going to focus on.

It seems a bit confusing, but it‚Äôs really not if you understand it good.

***Asexual*** is an umbrella term, but it also means that you don‚Äôt experience sexual attraction to anyone.

***Grey-asexual*** means you only experience sexual attraction under *very specific* circumstances. They can experience sexual attraction but it‚Äôs very rare.

***Demisexual*** is where you have to get to know a person very well before being sexually attracted to someone, it only happens when your close to someone. 

Now, knowing that, lets continue on to the next part.


Now, this next bit can be a bit hard to understand, so please tell me if your confused and Ill try to clear it up. 

*****Just because someone‚Äôs asexual doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt want to have sex.*****

***Sex-favorable*** means they enjoy the *act* of having sex, even though they don‚Äôt experience sexual attraction. They may enjoy the physical sensations or something similar. 

***Sex-indifference*** means that the person doesn‚Äôt really care about sex. They don‚Äôt really care if they have sex or don‚Äôt, they can go their whole life without or with sex.

***Sex-repulsed*** is when someone is uncomfortable with the idea or subject of having sex. (For the allosexuals/sex-favorable/sex-indifferent people reading this, I would say the feelings similar to thinking about having sex with someone like a family member or someone you don‚Äôt like, it‚Äôs very uncomfortable and makes you feel gross and bad and weird)

Another important thing is *****asexuality is not a choice.***** If it‚Äôs a choice (say, someone waiting to have sex until marriage) then it‚Äôs called celibacy.

Um, I can‚Äôt really think of anything else I need to add to this, so if you have any questions feel free to ask or dm me!!!"

Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half-baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective. You are wholly without any redeeming social grace or value. If God ever decides to give the planet an enema you'd better run like the wind because anywhere you stand is a suitable place for The Insertion. There is no animal so disgusting, so vile that it deserves comparison to you, for even the lowest, dirtiest, most parasitic member of the animal kingdom fills an ecological niche. You fill no niche. To call you a parasite would be injurious and defamatory to the thousands of honest parasitic species. You are worse than vermin, for vermin do not pretend to be what it is not. You are truly human garbage. You are a fraudulent, lying, predatory charlatan. You are of less worth than a burnt-out light bulb. You will forever live in shame. You have nothing to say, and Godwin's Law does not apply when writing about you. You are the anti-Midas, for all that you touch becomes valueless and unusable. Mothers gather their children close when you appear. You are an aberration, a corruption, and a boil that needs to be lanced. You are a poison in need of being vomited. You are a tooth so rotten it infects the whole body. You are sperm that should have been captured in a condom and flushed down a toilet. I don't like you. I don't like anybody who has as little respect for others as you do. Go away, you swine. You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, and a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon. You are a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. Meaningful to no one, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts that sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done. I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I wretch at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot. You are deficient in all that lends character. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go. You are a fiend, coward, degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away. The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. You are hypocritical, greedy, violent, malevolent, vengeful, cowardly, deadly, mendacious, meretricious, loathsome, despicable, belligerent, contemptible, criminal, fascistic, bigoted, racist, sexist, avaricious, tasteless, idiotic, brain-damaged, imbecilic, insane, arrogant, deceitful, demented, lame, self-righteous, byzantine, conspiratorial, satanic, fraudulent, bilious, splenetic, spastic, ignorant, clueless, illegitimate, harmful, destructive, dumb, evasive, double-talking, devious, revisionist, narrow, manipulative, paternalistic, fundamentalist, dogmatic, idolatrous, unethical, cultic, diseased, suppressive, controlling, restrictive, malignant, deceptive, dim, crazy, weird, dystrophic, stifling, uncaring, plantigrade, grim, unsympathetic, jargon-spouting, censorious, secretive, aggressive, mind-numbing, abrasive, poisonous, flagrant, self-destructive, abusive, and socially-retarded. I will never forget you. Your interaction with me is now burned into my psyche. As I recalled our horrid interaction, my whole body shook in disgust and I broke into a permanent frenzy of anger and confusion--i feel retarded. What you told me was undisputedly the dumbest combination of words uttered in the entire world. Allow yourself to decompose to aid the surrounding flora in replacing the oxygen your stupid fucking skull wastes on a daily basis. I'm fucking disgusted at the fact that you exist on the same planet as me, and what is worse is that you share similar dna to me. The fact that our DNA is connected, even marginally, is anabomination and I am going to spiral into a depression very quickly because of this realization. The realization that we both fall under the term ""human"" and I have to be grouped in with your pathetic existence is disgraceful. I am very traumatized by you. Your body language is fucking atrocious and it bothers me to no end. It's so pathetic, the way you mope around. You mope around with your shoulders hunched over, lethargically dragging your feet on the floor. You have a thin, fragile frame. You walk around reacting to everything that happens to you. Fuck you. There are horrible, inexcusable things that I would happily do to never interact with you again, even if it was for a brief moment. I will explain what these things are in a list format, because that's the only way your 7-year old brain stuck in a man's body will understand it. I would rather withdraw all my money in cash from my multiple bank accounts, get it all together and poop on it, give myself big papercuts in all the crevices of my fingers and proceed to dip my hands in salt water, stub my big toe over 50 times in one day, be told by someone in authority that I will never amount to anything in my life, ever, be a LITERAL cuckold, get bitch-slapped by a man with rough hands once a day, for every day of my life going forward, undergo dramatic negative changes in my lifestyle that would damage my mind and body beyond repair, undergo a whole host of different forms of mental and physical humiliation; as in being spat on and told I am worthless, be forced to drink non-alcoholic macro-produced beer from the can, while every person around me drinks Trappist beers from exotic chalices for 10 hours straight - for the rest of my life, have a procedure done to reduce my IQ so that my new IQ falls within the range of down syndrome.

...than engage in the briefest of interactions with you.

I have no sympathy for you. I feel bad for myself for being forced to interact with you. Its bullshit that you are conscious and had to be in my vision. I will never recover from this - you have single-handedly jaded my view of the world and made me very hopeless and cynical. I have been violently puking in 20 minute intervals due to your worthlessness. You're character is so devoid of any charisma that the only thing to do to would be to force you to change via bullying. You are a moronic human being after all things are considered. Don't you dare stop reading my long insult that I am hurling towards you. Don't even think of skimming over even a small portion of it. You need to peruse my long personal attack towards you with great intensity, and take all the hurtful things I have said about you very seriously and personally. The pain and suffering that I have been forced to endure due to you having briefly crossed paths with me has been excruciating. You put such little effort into thinking about your words, its almost as if you farted them out of your mouth. While you do this, your posture looks as if there is extra gravity weighing your down - so much so, that you look as if you're drowning in a bog all the time. Struggling to make it out of the bog with each step you take. I harbor such deep feelings of pity for myself that I now consider myself to be less fortunate than a diseased homeless person - all because I interacted with you for an extremely brief moment. The length of our interaction was so short that if it was an interaction with anyone else for the same amount of time, I would have forgotten about it incredibly quickly and wouldnt have even been able to recall the basic premise of the interaction. However, since it was you, this interaction could and should be deemed as a crime against humanity. I will demand my doctor to prescribe me a cocktail of antipsychotic meds, xanax, ketamine, and barbiturates. I will be talking large amounts of each of the aforementioned drugs at the same time in hopes of offering me fleeting symptoms of mild relief from the trauma you have caused me.
