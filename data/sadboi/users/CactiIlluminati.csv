stopsmoking,fp1xagp,t3_gaqrv5,1588250323.0,"Man I feel you, I was on 50 spliffs a day at one point, buying 1/4 keys for personal consumption, all mixed with amber tobacco. I looked ill, gaunt like a ghost. The reason you smoked spliffs was because you were addicted to nicotine. You'll never get the same sensation from neat weed because one of the components is missing. You'll never feel the same smoking weed now as you did. Also you don't need to replace the spliffs with another smoking device to consume weed as a habit. After I quit I've found the weed really blows my mind, I only need a small amount to be high. God knows how I coped before with all those spliffs lol. 

It simply doesn't have that big of a position in my life anymore because I'm not chaining spliffs all day long. I used to worry about running out because of the nicotine monster. Tobacco on its own wasn't very nice, it was like a car exhaust without the weed or hash mix. 

Sure it's going to all be a bit weird at first, you'll find yourself with a big hole in time you used to fill with hippy cigars, but I promise it will get better.  Take it from me, I was the number one toker of 30 years lol
