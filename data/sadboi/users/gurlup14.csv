BPD,euwei7x,t1_euwac9w,1564074290.0,"Yeah so the thing is to be surrounded by people that say: stop it, you are where you should be now just continue? And you've got to tell yourself that you have a reason to be there... I hope everything for you is gonna work on the long run and that you'll finally be able to put your mind into things that can help you in configurating that peace of mind we're all looking for!"
BPD,euvgogv,t3_ch8umt,1564060347.0,"It's amazing how we are all on a same boat for this. I'm F/23 and I've never felt like people of my age were at my, let's say level for the record, so I've kinda surrounded myself by older people. Like 10 to 15 years more than me. It comes easily, even with strangers in the streets. I either connect with young children, the supposedly fucked up ones that lost everything or the +30yo.
Strangely enough, I feel like I will never be enough to get where people my age are since I quit home so soon and had no idea what the fuck to do with my damned soul BUT I get along with people with so much more experience (count it per years not by events) because I feel much more included and it's like I can use them as role models. Like : how should I be because I can't be a normal 23yo and won't get to the place everyone is rn.

The thing is, when I realize that these friends have gone through years of studies or are lost in their choices for a few months, I feel so young but reassured and also I panick because I don't want to be still choosing what I want to do by that time!!!

Feelings of being too mature but not well equipped to face life is harsh to deal with and I wish I was just normal for this part."
BPD,euvf30v,t1_euradoa,1564059725.0,How did you find stability? It's been so long now that this way of living is keeping me on the edge that no one is ever surprised anymore when I mention that I'm about to move out or leave another boyfriend or that I changed jobs 3 times since the last time I saw anyone... And I see me loved ones on a regular lol.
BPD,es4n3g4,t1_es2kxb5,1561588763.0,"Thank you for your answer. This is sweet. We need to take care of one another. There is a lot to see and we are a lot on this sub so why is it so hard to answer or be answered by one of our brother or sister?
Anyways, you made me think of something and that had its impact. 
I started to see someone(therapist) and I'm the meda already but I feel it's not the right meds and I always quit therapy at some point. That I did, so the follow up is not done and I feel like I just go down again. 

You are right about patience. It is something we all have if we put time on it ;)

Peace. âœŒðŸ’œ"

BPD4BPD,erv01pr,t1_eruev1m,1561302569.0,"When I create it's like it's never enough and when I feel that down this is when to create makes so much sense but I'm afraid of what could get out maybe, that people would see/read/hear how strong it is. These days I'm thinking how good that would be though to spread a message that I've tried to scream on mute for so long. But only deaf people can read on lips right? So it's important to take the part of you that needs to shout through anything. To be productive with it. Anyways, you did make it about you, I did it about me, because we live through our own experiences and that asking questions is something you do on a private message. Thank you for sharing your experience."
BPD4BPD,er5t9mh,t1_eqyvzdh,1560533036.0,I sometimes hit myself on walls or whatever when no one is around me.
BPD4BPD,er5t4i6,t1_eqyvzdh,1560532954.0,Hallucintations? I feel things aren't real. I don't feel there. I feel sometimes as if I could see through people hut I guess I'm projecting on them what I feel about myself as if they were feeling it towards me. I blackout a lot. It's major when I'm in an intense moment. I can't recall shit.  But what do you mean by altercations with myself and unintended consequences I couldn't map out?
BPD4BPD,eqxhkmz,t1_eqt5cba,1560369421.0,"At some point it does. And then my mood changes so quickly that I kinda forget that I felt that way and that no onr answers and I'm okay with it. But observing this feels pointless you are right. 
I guess there is nothing to say. It's done.
I hope you have a great day anyways! ðŸ˜Š"
BPD,ep0fxpe,t1_ep0fldm,1558974914.0,"Same, and they're like fully into the memory as it feels like you are a stranger to whom they're telling a story"
BPD,ep0aypf,t1_eozmgat,1558973112.0,I don't recall almost everything but i'm like: yeah that might've happened if you say so. Some stories are repeated over and over or are more traumatic I guess and so you integrate them but it's like the only memories you can tell to others. It happens even with short term stuff. I know if someone says that something was with me by the answer they tell me I gave. If it sounds like something I would say I'm like : yup that must've been with me. Lol
BPD,eoz8063,t1_eoz6nux,1558957140.0,"Yeah, cause in the end I feel like this person is too good to hear how dark and empty and hurt it is inside. Or that he even wont believe it because of the high positive energy I can have. With my friends or strangers I could let them know everything with even a dramatic expression of how i feel really. But to my FP's i've only blocked when I wanted to try to open up this way."
BPD,eow75xe,t1_eov9q66,1558905932.0,I feel like he's the only one I have trouble truly and honestly talking to. Like if i'm so close to this person I have to not express all that's inside pr they'll stop loving me or want to be around for some reason.
BPD,eorlkvs,t3_bst7x1,1558808924.0,"Ha! Every hour. The other night I almost went to overdose on my pharmacy meds because I thought I was to fuckedup to ever have a healthy relationship with anyone even myself. The next day I'm all smile and happy. Then one night I feel like breaking up with my bf, i feel like this is deep this is the end he's not for me I gotta tell him now or I won-t sleep. I finally don't say shit and wake up all happy next to him wanting to spend the whole day with him and give so much love as I'm thinking how good he is for me. And then I get sour 1 minute and everything goes down again. I just want it to stoooop"
BPD,eooibke,t1_eooi8l4,1558739255.0,And patience
BPD,eooi8l4,t3_bsmvuu,1558739196.0,"It's been lile that in my 4 last relationships. Even this new one I thought everything would go alright and that I won't have outbursts, be angry, cry for nothing or find the evil in him after some time and be the one that triggers those on and off push/pull situations. It didn't do shit even as conscious as I am of the pattern. I don't know how to get out of this shit. The only thing I can see that would be good for it is at first learning by yourself how to express your emotions correctly and be more aware of everthing and maintain healthy coping mechanisms. But also the person that's dating must be open to talk about it, learn about it and not enter the game. Or else it won't work."
