ask,ewvsxxy,t3_cqcqo3,1565813277.0,"Yes, I have experienced sleep paralysis before. My boyfriend's brother was at his apartment and I was sleeping on the bean bag in the living room. It was really scary because I woke up and couldn't move, felt like I couldn't breathe, and when I tried calling for my boyfriend's brother I couldn't speak. It was honestly horrifying and I thought I was dying. I didnt hallucinate, but my vision was really spinny."

ask,ert1ji1,t3_c3nukc,1561229910.0,My boyfriend and I are best friends and we have been together for over a year. I'd say go for it if you both have feelings for each other. If it wouldn't work out it doesn't mean you guys still can't be friends after.

depression,erkre3n,t3_c2fuf3,1560969731.0,"When I lived on my own, with other people of course,  it made my depression way worse. Now that I've moved back into my parent's house my life has gotten a lot better actually. I've started taking my meds again and my parents are super understanding and go easy on me when I can barely make it out of bed some days. Hang in there, it gets better OP."
