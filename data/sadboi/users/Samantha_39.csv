AMA,fmo56cm,t1_fmo3qmu,1586245775.0,"Yep. So it started during my second to last class. It happened so quickly, that I didn't even notice that the alarm went off. I was tired that day so that's probably why. If I remember right, the alarm set up a pre recorded message that said ""Attention, a lockdown has been declared at (school name) near (real). All staff and students must now now follow the following ALICE procedure and wait until further notice or instructions."" It was definitely one of the scariest moments of my life. I remember for a split moment, I was just frozen, and so was everyone else in the class. The teachers reacted first, and then we did. Half of us, including myself, went to the corner of the room and the rest started to lock the door and place desks and stuff in front of it. Like one third of the class was panicking and crying. My first thought was ""no way this is fake, right?"" I was shivering from pure fear..it was insane. I just remember pulling out my phone and desperately trying to get connection, silently muttering ""omg"" repeatedly, and without even realizing, I pulled out a pair of scissors and held them like a knife. I just couldn't stop shaking..the worst part is that half my class didn't want to shut the fuck up. So yeah. They soon after announced that it was a false alarm set up to pick up 'gunshot-like' sounds..not fun."
AMA,fmo4aln,t1_fmo4351,1586244865.0,No like we had an ACTUAL false alarm. It ended up being triggered because the speakers picked up a noise that sounded similar to gunshots.
AmItheAsshole,fmo33lj,t1_fmo2wqo,1586243621.0,No it's totally okay! Every opinion helps. I need honesty from other people so I can decide on what to do. The problem is the fact that she hangs out with my other friends. I don't know how I'll be able to cut her out of my life completely.
