Tonight's my first night without weed in months and I just noticed when I'm not high I find it very hard to not focus on the shit. I think my mind left ages ago and without any substances I'm just a broken man with nothing in life to look forward to.

Recently tired hanging myself it was alot less painful it felt like a dream with no pain or memory of stepping off the table I used to hooks and 8 long screws to hold me but the screws came out I had pre tested my weight and it had worked but woke up with a noose on my neck. But it really felt like a dream and the best part is none found out it happened so next time I will get it right but no rush even though the ever growing push to die is real in my head I wish no harm on anyone else I'm just not cut out for life.

You think it would be painful but I swear the last time I tried it I filt like I was in a dream and that i didn't step off the table and in the space of what felt like a second I opened my eyes I was on the floor with a noose tight around my neck I was confused got it off the screws failed to hold me nobody found out about that attempt I was unconscious for close to 30 minutes. But I have no fear of death I more fear the possibility that something my happen and i won't be in a position to end my life. So i figure I'll do it while i have the chance.

SuicideWatch,f6wmnac,t3_dthktf,1573230077.0,I suffered from anxiety for many years and felt trapped in my own home because I didn't want to go outside. Then I started to force myself into awkward situations it turned me down a route of drugs and alchol. Now from the outside my life seems perfect when really I'm destroying myself more each day. Iv tried to end my life 4 times in the past year it's like iv got this weight on me and the only escape is death drink helps as a release. I tried getting help it all went to shit so now I do this fake happy act where people think I'm better but really I'm debating my death every second and I even have a pre made noose in my wardrobe so that I can escape when I feel like it. But moral off the story push yourself out off your comfort zone and fuck what you think other people think about you because it really doesn't matter we all fucked anyway just constantly distracting our selfs from life. PM if you want too
SuicideWatch,f6whxc5,t3_dtgq5u,1573226983.0,Dont be sorry for anything where all in the same boat here I watched a youtube video on making a noose the other week and tried hanging myself it wasn't successful. I still have one sitting in my wardrobe ready for when I need it but I like the fact I'm looking death in the face and can do it when ever I want. So why not try living the life you want do what ever the fuck you want because you can kill yourself at any point it's like a golden ticket out but dosnt have to be today

But that doesn't mean we should give up either it just means live our lifes the way we want to who cares how someone elses lives really. Anyway I shouldnt be commenting Iv tried to kill myself 4 times in the past year. First I tried overdoing, then slicing my wrists, then crashing my car, then hanging myself!! Now fuck me either I have the best luck in the world or the worst I can't decide which it is. My mother died when I was six my dad last month but he was a drug addict and constantly abused everyone I had cut him off 6 months prior to his dead. All my grandparents are dead my brother is dead to be honest most my family are now dead I'm 23 it's like fuck haha I have become so accustomed to death that I know longer have a fear off it. I sorta embrace it like it's a challenge I have to complete. Now I have this act with people I call it fake happy where you make everyone believe that your happy when really the second your on your own you are in complete shit debating death every second.
