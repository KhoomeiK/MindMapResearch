BPD,f6xt4li,t3_dtm9ep,1573257773.0,"I wish I could go back to that time. I've been single for 7 seven years and I've really stable, but now I've been dating my bf for 6 months and I'm a wreck. I hate it. I want to be single again and have no worries but I love him and I love our special times but I also hate him and I hate being insecure about every fucking thing"

AvPD,eoom3n6,t1_eomhbf5,1558741980.0,"Thanks I could definitely say something like that. I always ask him if there's anything I can do to help, but we live pretty far away from each other and I usually respond with that so I always feel like I have nothing else to say"

I feel like over text is even harder to talk because there is much more pressure to write a good/nice response because you have more time to think about it, especially if you don't reply right away? But it only makes me way more nervous and eventually I don't even respond at all
I don't know if this makes sense"
