I watched it on a day where I was massively hungover, bowls of food on the ground, shades closed.... just gross shit and I already felt off. Nothing happens in the movie that is specifically disturbing, but the colors, acting, etc. affected me in a strange way. I felt off for days after watching it"

AskReddit,eryh1wa,t3_c4p6l1,1561408370.0,"I worked for a restaurant. The GM was always a sleez. We will call him “Pato” For example, he thought I was mentally challenged because I am quiet, so when he told me to mop or sweet he would ask veeeerrrrry slllooooowwwwllly and act out the mopping and sweeping motions. This continued even after we had partaken in various conversations. 

That’s beside the point. There was a younger woman who worked on the line who was very quiet and spoke little English. We will call her “Emily” After working there for a few months I found out that Pato was Emily’s uncle. She would get priority shifts, time off whenever without requesting off, pay raises (which is fucking rare for a line cook), and special attention from Pato. 

Almost every other employee noticed and would bitch about it amongst each other. The only problem was that Emily was extremely kind and quiet. Pato began driving her home constantly and becoming very hands on with her at work, touching her waist as he scooted by, scratching her back, constantly staring at her, i don’t know, creepy shit. I worked with my roommate and he said that he saw her kiss her in the car when they got in to leave work. 

Pato had a wife who would frequent in the restaurant, always in a seemingly horrible mood. Pato would constantly bitch about her amongst his most trusted workers and whenever she was coming in he would announce it to all of the employees in a bizzare tone as if he wanted everyone to know so they wouldn’t talk about it. There was a bizzare feeling in this restaurant all the time. 

Aside from the creepiness, Pato was later found abusing his wife and spending an extended amount of time in jail. He is very familiar with the higher ups in our company and after he got out he was able to come back to work in his same role. When he was away in jail, Emily was clearly pregnant. She ended up telling my close friend who worked there that the child was Patos. Pretty much everyone quit after that. The restaurant location ended up closing less than a month later. Me and pretty much everyone else left without a notice. It was the most odd kitchen I’ve ever worked in."
