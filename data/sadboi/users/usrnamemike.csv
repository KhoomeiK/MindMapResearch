LGV60,fr2x817,t3_gmbz4f,1589845655.0,Great write up! I agree with all of your points. My brother and i got these on a BOGO deal so we're essentially paying 475 a piece and just sold both of our screen cases for 300. Coming from my pixel 3 i definitely agree the software is subpar and wish LG would work on that portion but i knew that would be an issue going in. Overall I'm happy and will continue to use it for the two years.
LGV60,fr2wwv6,t3_gmbpkm,1589845484.0,Of course the Verizon variant doesn't have this option üòëüòë
LGV60,fr0zzoj,t1_fr0wrxo,1589810523.0,It's under Settings/Extensions/Increased Touch Sensitivity
verizon,fqnifx8,t1_fqna39m,1589495424.0,"I believe they actually changed to 2 major updates to Android 12 now. I'll try and find the link.

LGV60,fqg3gjs,t1_fqg37b5,1589337168.0,For sure! I wish someone would make some because I've actually started using my v60 without a case and love it. A skin would be really nice.
LGV60,fqf6hv9,t3_gigaht,1589319527.0,I emailed dbrand a week or so ago and got a response saying there was no plans to make a skin for the V60. Kind of a bummer.
LGV60,fq9mhcl,t3_ghm0ov,1589202264.0,Did you factory reset the watch before pairing it to the v60?
LGV60,fq8r3sy,t3_ghh4uv,1589173182.0,Decided the dual screen wasn't for me. Used for 1 day and put back in the box. Figured someone might be looking for one.
LGV60,fq4o1mv,t1_fq39m4l,1589080251.0,Happy cake day!
LGV60,fpp0frq,t1_fpoxked,1588793795.0,Awesome!!
LGV60,fpodf3f,t3_gen0ve,1588782615.0,"I've had my V60 for around 3 weeks or so now and like it. The battery life is great and all around the phone is good. Admittedly I do not enjoy the software experience on it as much as I do on my Pixel 3, if LG would just put stock Android on it I would be in heaven. I don't really use the second screen unless I'm at home as I find it too bulky and ""in the way"" at work. The under screen fingerprint sensor can be hit or miss and the ambient light sensor is a little over kill sometimes. No real major issues I can think of right now. And overall am pretty happy with my purchase. I do wish LG would step up their game with software but I know what I was getting into when I bought it. Any questions just ask!

Edit: ambient light sensor not proximity sensor"
LGV60,fpnqv8c,t3_geflas,1588770585.0,Just noticed this when I was taking it off this morning. Kind of annoying honestly.
GooglePixel,fpmgn3d,t1_fpltjid,1588732655.0,Happy cake day!
Chainsaw,fpdrqdn,t1_fpddguu,1588532894.0,Agree 100% find a dealer who is helpful and is willing to help you learn and build a relationship and stick with them.
mentalhealth,fp6bvdv,t3_gbgypq,1588349667.0,You're amazing!!
LGV60,fp3y8kw,t3_g9ckkt,1588288047.0,Got mine today! Approved 4/5!
ram_trucks,fp3vjja,t1_fp34c88,1588286597.0,Not op but I've had my duratracs on my 2013 ram 1500 for about a year and love them. My only real complaint would be that they've gotten a little loud since new. Nothing crazy but noticable. They have done great in a all conditions also! When I need new tires I will be getting these again!
LGV60,foyumtc,t1_foyr6wl,1588179478.0,"Sorry, 6 hours and 30 minutes of SOT"
LGV60,foyuiwn,t1_foymv0g,1588179419.0,"Auto brightness, and I do have location on for some things but I have it restricted for most things."
LGV60,foylra7,t1_foye4vu,1588174791.0,Today I ended with 28 and 6 1-2 sot. Still crazy good compared to my pixel 3 lol was just curious to see what everyone else was getting.
Ask_Politics,forcigl,t1_for79cz,1588009907.0,I'm not gonna lie..üòèüòè
LGV60,foo6073,t3_g7gjex,1587933176.0,Thanks for this! Got it all setup and it's working awesome!!
Pixel3,fond90p,t1_fond3po,1587917247.0,There is also a mobile phone repair kit at Walmart that comes with some of the tools needed.
Pixel3,fond3po,t1_fon63lv,1587917164.0,"I wasn't sure about it at first, but after doing it I will never replace a phone based on battery performance again. I honestly went to harbor freight and got their 10 dollar one lol. It worked perfect. And with the repair tools that came with the kit it wasn't nearly as bad. I will say the only thing that was more of a pain then I had planned for was the replacement waterproof seal. You definitely have to take your time setting it."
Pixel3,fokxj7p,t3_g7vog3,1587850839.0,I had noticed this also. I decided to replace my battery. It wasn't bad to do and cost me a total of about 30 bucks with buying the heat gun also.
GooglePixel,fok5znn,t3_g7hry1,1587836027.0,I love this feature. But it is so annoying sometimes because it brings up the keyboard switcher.
LGV60,fo91zsi,t3_g69c5e,1587608740.0,I've been doing this as well but with lawnchair. It will stay for the most part but does randomly change back with certain actions.
LGV60,fo4ze3g,t1_fo3wuvv,1587514249.0,"Something I just tested was covering where the camera is and trying to get it to fall asleep. It doesn't react, but when I cover the right side of the ear piece it does almost instantly. I'm guessing the sensor is there. I'm going to test in the morning and see if I can get it to react."
LGV60,fo3zbju,t1_fo3z5b3,1587495515.0,That's exactly what's happening with me. The left one is the one that almost always causes issues. I've re registered them a couple times and it always seems to be the same results.
LGV60,fo3yzfl,t3_g5e915,1587495351.0,"Another one is one of my finger prints not being read, then using another to unlock it. After unlocking it then locking it again the same fingerprint that wouldn't work seems to work fine. It can be extremely finicky at times.

Edit: I am using a screen protector and have enhanced sensitivity turned on."
LGV60,fo3y3bq,t3_g5kr02,1587494909.0,Man this is looking really good. Great work!
LGV60,fo3wuvv,t1_fo3vx6w,1587494302.0,That is super annoying. Where I work it's quite dark until sunrise and when it shuts my AOD off its extremely irritating looking over and not having the option too just quickly glance to see notifications etc
LGV60,fo3vc9h,t3_g5e915,1587493561.0,In darker rooms the screen will go black and need a couple presses of the power button to wake back up.
LGV60,fo314g9,t1_fo311mz,1587478530.0,Very interesting
LGV60,fo2r5mp,t3_g52qpr,1587471958.0,Are you using a screen protector? I've made a post also and after that I've noticed that if the screen protector has any dirt whatsoever in the area around the camera this will happen. It just happened this morning and I cleaned off that area with my shirt and it started working again.
ram_trucks,fo0b4me,t1_fo077qx,1587409476.0,It's actually Idaho Forest group now. Clearwater sold the wood side in 2011! But that's awesome you know it!
ram_trucks,fnz196k,t3_g4k3qy,1587383062.0,Looks good! I have duratracs also and love them! Great looking pickup
LGV60,fnx77f9,t3_g4es0x,1587332836.0,Yessssss
LGV60,fnmnxno,t1_fnmfl92,1587074867.0,Funny because I was trying to see where the 4th one was and gave up trying to find it lol. So thanks!
Pixel3,fndj983,t3_g14om4,1586871276.0,You can turn off the suggestion strip in the text correction section of settings. But that will disable the next word prediction. I don't see any other way.
LGV60,fmqft91,t3_fwq59d,1586298788.0,Just went through this. I couldn't figure out why I was getting denied because the half page had everything they wanted. So I decided to do the whole page and got approved. They sure are picky haha
LGV60,fmig1jc,t3_fuacrj,1586108845.0,Ended up getting denied for the one without my name. The one with did get approved today. Resubmitted for the one that got denied.
LGV60,fmbvbno,t1_fmbv7pd,1585933883.0,"Nice to know, I submitted my first one with a receipt that didn't have my name on it. I'm hoping they just approve it so I don't have to resubmit it."
LGV60,fmbugb5,t1_fmbn2d5,1585933419.0,Are you going to fight it or is it just denied with no chance of getting it?
LGV60,fmbubpd,t3_fuacrj,1585933349.0,I just did this and didn't read thoroughly and sent them a receipt without my name on it. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I hope I don't get denied. It's kind of bs it doesn't ship with it.
aww,erjrb18,t1_erjqlot,1560944012.0,She definitely makes it difficult! Thank you!
