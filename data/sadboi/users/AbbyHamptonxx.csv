There's plenty of info outt there out being gay and being Christian, about different ways of viewing the bible. Why continue to torture yourself likee this?? You can't surpress your urges, that's nott healthy or reasonable. Doesn't mean you havee to have sex, watch porn or go on random hookups.. being gay doesn't have to have anything do with any of those things. gay doesn't have to equate to lust.. you can be gay and in lovee, be gayy and wait on sex.. be gay and be a virgin or single. There's nothing wrong with having crushes or sexual urges cause everyone except ppl who are asexual have them. It's normal, how you feel is normal. When you view homosexuality as a sin you're depriving yourself of one of the best things about sexuality, love. When you deny yourself the ability to date and be in love, you're gonna resort to porn and random hook ups. Humans have needs. You can choose to accept yourself and go out and have a healthy relationship with someone of the same sex that you're genuinely attracted to and in love with or you can continue to suppress your sexuality and be upset with yourself when you resort to porn or random hook ups cause your human urges aren't going away. Why nott act on them in a healthy way??"
