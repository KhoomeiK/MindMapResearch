depression,evyu1e2,t3_clue8y,1564941400.0,You need to die!! But NOT PHYSICALLY! The person you are today needs to die and your subconscious is aware of this. You are depressed for a reason!! Depression isnt a cause of something its the affect of something. The questions is whats the cause?! Is it your diet? Body? Past? Career? Love life? These are things to think about! You need fo understand that theres more than 1 type of death. The person you are today needs to die so a new you can be born tomorrow. I used to be suicidal and depressed until I learned this and changed every aspect of my life and now I want to be a life coach. The fact that you realize the person you are today needs to die is AMAZING! You just have the wrong type of death. Remember depression is the affect of something! Figure out the cause fix it and you will be happy again!!! Im here for you!
careerguidance,evuzz0p,t1_evuxt8f,1564812897.0,Nothing. Life coaching isnt regulated its just something im passionate about and I plan on getting my certs on the side. Coaching is one of the main things I do on my day to day with people I know and total strangers online. I made this just to get other peoples views and thoughts

lifecoaching,eutqt5j,t3_chizrc,1564030157.0,Stop thinking start doing. Your focusing to much on the issues instead of doing the actions it takes to fix them. Stay out of your head and just ‚Äúdo‚Äù
relationships,eugutkb,t3_cgdfeq,1563815297.0,"With you 2 being so focused on everything else but each other it's not uncommon for these things to happen. Just be very very grateful he informed you of his feelings and didn't go behind your back to act on them. (so many people do that and it is the backbone of divorce). Now what you 2 need to do is 1 of 2 things. First try and get around each other and do fun things together. Only fun things maybe even things you 2 have never done before. Skydiving? A weekend getaway at the beach? Something fun and new to bond and create a new feeling. The second thing is only if the first doesn't work but I'm confident the first will work just fine. KEEP WORKING ON YOURSELF!!! A lot of times relationships fail due to the lack of self Improvement. You have been put in a shitty situation so now your dressing better, working out more, etc which is great not only for your relationship but for yourself. (Relationships are work!!) the main thing to remember is that love is 2 things. Feeling and knowing. Mind and body, heart and soul. What I mean is feelings fade naturally. When we are mad at our SO we aren't loving them we are mad at them. but it's the knowing that keeps you in love. Feelings fade but they come back with work. As long as you don't give up on the knowing aka the mind the feelings will come back and you will have his heart again. As far as the crush you have to get rid of her. She's a crack in your marriages foundation. Notice how shes appeared as your relationship is facing low times. Get rid of the snake..... Your husband sounds amazing especially since he told you about these feelings toward her. He doesn‚Äôt love her or may not even like her. Its just shes ‚Äònew‚Äô. So you are going to have to be the ‚Äònew‚Äô girl again and create ‚Äònew‚Äô memories and experiences with him. Idk how your sex life is but maybe even spice that up some. Role play or do public stuff even if its just teasing ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just throwing out some ideas that could help you! You will be fine i promise just keep up the good work and don‚Äôt give up!"
lifecoaching,ettq9xk,t3_cderuy,1563192338.0,Change.... advice will not matter unless you actually do something about it.. the fact that you are aware of these flaws and dont care tells me its just utter laziness. Stop thinking and start doing. Lifes to short to accept failure. Stop thinking about your problems and start solving them.
depression,etms323,t3_ccaxvm,1562967178.0,"Your just going through another life cycle. Life cycles happen every 7-12 years. Your maturing and evolving as a person. You just have to keep pushing. Everything happens in cycles when it comes to life, your just going through the shitty part and next is the best shit. Keep pushing!"
straightedge,erdh2rl,t3_c1inpb,1560741793.0,Your never to young.... its a lifestyle and as long as you want to be straight edge then be that. Dont let anyone tell you otherwise if anything they should support it
