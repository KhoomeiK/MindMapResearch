Your therapist absolutely can handle this and will not find it strange that you may have forgotten this until now. Be honest that you are not sure if it really happened. Even if this memory is more of a “worst fear” than an actual event, it’s likely born out of issues you have yet to process and need to work through.

Oh wait a minute the switch from weeks to months is gonna be a mind blower. 

It’s an elaborate remedy, OP, but you could just celebrate anniversaries on her system, get married, have a baby (weeks will be a great system during pregnancy because pregnancy is all about dem weeks), and then let her figure this out on her own when she needs to schedule a 6 month checkup for her 24 week old baby and the pediatrician offers her the 6 month rather than 24 weeks date.

AmItheAsshole,fi6uee5,t1_fi6ttl5,1582207657.0,"I tend to agree but I think that nuance could be easily lost on someone feeling insecure about their sex life.  Because six times might feel like a dream life for someone who hasn’t had sex at all, for example. No one wants to feel like everyone else is having tons of sex while they aren’t having any. That might even be why this douchey roommate brags about six partners - in comparison to his roommates it might be a lot.  It makes people with lots of partners feel better to laugh at the guy for his pride but I’m willing to bet it makes those with fewer partners feel insecure. I know people don’t mean it that way but I think unintentional shaming about sexual inexperience leads to a lot of angst that people will very rarely  endorse because of how insecure and embarrassed they feel."

I know everyone is super disgusted by OPs roommate, which makes it very satisfying to comment on his numbers, but OP sort of self admitted he may be struggling in this area so I think it’s helpful to admit that six sexual partners is actually a lot for many young men.  Laughing at the number, while tempting, kind of plays into the “increase my tally or else I am a loser” mindset. His pride about six partners would be mostly fine if it were experienced...internally.

He also said he could probably improve the appearance of my nose even though I was not there about the appearance of my nose. Soooooo....

I ended up at a different doc. No skin graft needed. He also mentioned cosmetic changes despite me not asking about cosmetic changes. I could not afford the 3k extra to have them make cosmetic changes but that doc did me a solid and improved the look of it quite a bit without billing for any cosmetic changes.

People just do not understand the years of suffering that precedes a decision to transition.

I think the odds are in your favor in your own home, even if a creep has your address."
UlcerativeColitis,fg22ifc,t1_fg15anb,1580436912.0,My new habit is to clean the whole house before I go and then either gym or groceries in the two good hours I have after infusion and before exhaustion sets in.
AskDocs,ffk580v,t1_ffk4k9v,1580016260.0,"If you are imminently suicidal they may want to hospitalize you and get you started on some anti depressants or simply monitor you. If they believe you can stay safe they may just make a referral for counseling.  If you do not think you can keep yourself safe, please go.  Many smart, talented, brave, and amazing people have felt exactly how you feel. Acute suicidal ideation is a medical emergency and should be responded to just like any other medical emergency."
AskDocs,ffk47dq,t1_ffk3lw9,1580015311.0,Glad you are with sister. Good job. You have zero evidence that this will last for life.  Sometimes brains are liars! Yours is lying to you right now. Tell your brain you appreciate it for trying to keep you safe from the medicine but it’s working too hard and you don’t need it to worry you any more because you tossed the meds. There is no way your brain could know this will last forever. That would be a magical brain and your brain is awesome but not so awesome that it can tell the future. The overwhelming majority of folks who have used this drug are fine today. You will be one of those people! Have sister take you to ER if needed. Stay in frequent touch with parents. Maybe they can come visit?

AskDocs,ffk0anl,t1_ffjziaj,1580011904.0,"Also could be unrelated to meds. I get brain fog before a virus.  Keep repeating, “This too shall pass.”"
AskDocs,ffk02mo,t1_ffjzb0o,1580011717.0,"Are you close with your family? Can you call them? 

You have to remember the odds of having life long side effects from any medication are infinitesimally small. So small as to be not worth worrying about. I have taken several meds in my life that made me feel icky for a few days but my brain has always righted itself. Yours will too. The worry and fear can make concentration nearly impossible. It’s incredibly difficult to think clearly when panicked.  If you can calm yourself down through comforting distraction you may realize that some of what you are feeling is from the fear/anxiety and not the meds. 

But given how you feel with regard to suicidal thoughts, it also makes sense to get help immediately.  The ER is your best option on a Saturday night.   You should not be alone in this state of mind."
AskDocs,ffjyjn1,t1_ffjxwph,1580010487.0,"Good! First, if you continue to feel acutely suicidal, please visit the ER, and certainly ASAP if you have plans and the means to end your life.  I don’t want you to make a decision with permanent consequences during a challenging time that is certainly temporary. 

If you are not suicidal, and can keep yourself safe,  I still think it makes sense to reach out to a psychiatrist very soon. It’s concerning that you became suicidal after taking this medicine. I think it’s very important to make a psychiatrist aware of that so you have a good plan in place should it happen again. 

Also, a clinical psychologist might be helpful to see regularly. Med school can take a toll on one’s mental health!  Talking those stressors through with someone can be so very valuable."
AskDocs,ffjxrx7,t1_ffjxiky,1580009879.0,"Definitely take a study break. Do something which allows your brain a chance to go autopilot.  

Also, FWIW, I can tell you are able to respond quickly, with correct grammar, all while communicating perfect comprehension of what I wrote. Cognitively speaking, that’s incredibly reassuring.  Seems like a healthy brain to me. Just needs some rest and downtime."
AskDocs,ffjxbmn,t1_ffjx2nr,1580009519.0,"It will not last forever. And the fear about it can really start to make you unintentionally exacerbate the symptoms. 

Is there a movie you have memorized because you love it so much? 

Try watching that and giving your brain a break from thinking/worrying. If that feels good, watch another one. 

Is there a friend you can call to watch a movie with you?"
AskDocs,ffjwyap,t1_ffjw6y5,1580009224.0,"You’re getting ahead of yourself. This will pass. Your brain needs time to right itself. If you can, get a doctors note and get an extension on schoolwork. 

Someday this experience will make you a better doctor.  Life is full of unexpected challenges and your patients will be facing those unexpected challenges.  Having been through something similar will teach you much more than a textbook ever can. 

Deep breaths. Know it will pass. Let your brain right itself. Ask for help if you can’t stay safe. THIS IS TEMPORARY.  Please remind yourself."

askwomenadvice,ffgw9pm,t1_ffg2375,1579916671.0,Still seems a bit harsh for him to tell you he wasn’t attracted to you “at all at first.” I dunno. Gives me a bad feeling. I can’t imagine saying that to someone unless they were like objectively hot and super confident and I was fairly sure they could handle it.
