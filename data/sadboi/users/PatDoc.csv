You can lead a grey to a race track, but absolutely nothing you can do if they don’t have the drive to race. This is where a lot of our adopted racers come from. They “fail out of racing school” and end up happy on someone’s couch."

General guidance is for every 5 lbs over their healthy “racing weight” you take a year off their life. But think about it in terms of humans, for every 10 lbs over your “ideal weight” think about how much strain is put on your joints, heart, and kidneys."

I tell people it’s a lot like getting the chance to date again, but with the knowledge that they are likely not going to leave. We are currently childless, but the dogs seem to have adjusted well to the every other weekend schedule.

AskReddit,fnbxsyg,t3_g0lur9,1586824461.0,"I was at work after the dinner rush. I knew the story of the man in the tall black hat, I’d just never seen him personally. I was reporting to a nurse about my recommendation for a diet and swallowing precautions I wanted a patient who was nearing their end of their life. We were discussing how the patient wouldn’t likely make it more than a few days and had already been chattering to me about “the small kids at the end of the bed” and the “tall man”. I was facing the nurse with my back to the hall way I had just come from and she was looking over my shoulder. I felt a tap on my shoulder and a glimpse of darkness out of the corner of my eye. The nurse just grinned at me as I whipped around where I saw only an empty hallway. She said, “you just saw him too, didn’t you?” The patient passed 12 hours later. 

I gotta be honest. It’s not the tall man with the hat that freaks me out. Not the kids. Not the fact that the 100 year old patients tend to congregate around the room of the next upcoming one to pass. Those are all informative and help me know when to call family in. The thing that freaks me out so much is the fact that they all see the same damn thing. Regardless of their health, reason of passing, illness, whatever, if their march toward the end of life is slow enough to see it in stages, they all talk about the same things that they see. Family members long passed calling out to them, the small kids standing unobtrusive at the edge of the room (in broad daylight mind you), and the tall man with the hat. It’s so consistent you can almost set a clock by it. 

Ask any nurse. They are made of steel and iron, but they all know the signs the other patients give off when someone is about to pass.

The fellow that had hit me said, “just pull over here into this lot. It’s my fraternity house.” Out poured 20 some semi inebriated frat boys all trying to change my tire in the summer sun . As we were waiting for the cop to come and work the accident and write the report, the next thing I know, the frat boys stat taking off their shirts and continuing to try and take the tire off. It was an interesting scene as the cop pulled up. Me standing dressed to kill, 20 some dudes in various states of dress, car parts everywhere. It certainly felt like I had walked into a porno situation."

A #support tag when you want to have an opportunity to say you did a good thing like increasing savings instead of impulse shopping and you just want some validation and reminder that your doing your best.

A “word of the day “ post that explains what a simple financial concept is, it’s pros/cons, requirements for this being a good choice for you, and when it might be advantageous to do so. 
For example: a CD stock- description, benefits, cons, might be good for someone who is looking for more interest than a savings account and doesn’t need access to 1000$ for a year, you can acquire this at a bank."
