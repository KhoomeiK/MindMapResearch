ptsd,fnatnvm,t3_g0jxsb,1586803632.0,"I get what your saying but in the long haul. I’ve never expected someone to know how I truly feel deep inside. Or the absolute fear and panic I deal with at times. It’s literally impossible. For example, I can’t comprehend the pain a person endured who served in the military (their experience of absolute horror) This is difficult...but I try my best to just be understanding...that my problems are not other people’s. Yes it’s wonderful to have support and it’s desperately needed but it’s unrealistic to think that anyone can more or less digest what is inside us. I think this comes down to acceptance. I try my best to just let go of things even when I’m hurting inside. The COVID garbage has really made me aware of just being “aware”. I’ve had a really difficult life. But on the other hand I have come to the conclusion that WE are strong and so much more resilient than we with PTSD and Anxiety give ourselves credit for. 

I wish you and everyone well. Peace and health....patience too :)"

Focus on the breath. The mind can’t comprehend 2 thoughts at once...therefore focus on your breathing. This scientifically works and is highly effective. I wish you luck.

adultsurvivors,flpxtqi,t3_fqaq2h,1585372039.0,I admire your courage in placing your feelings out there. Honestly that’s a very big step. There is way too much to write ( for I’ve been exactly where you are)but in short find a therapist that you can openly speak with to air out your true feelings. All I can say to you is I so can relate to your feelings and self hatred. But if you do a little bit of work on yourself and invest in the best you... you can be...you’ll find that your a beautiful human under all that poisonous thinking. But it’s work. Move a muscle and change a though. I promise you it’s so worth it.....and yes YOU ARE WORTH IT! Hang in there 🙏

Your very brave and I really respect you. I thank you for your service and I hope your hard work pays dividends for your future. You truly deserve it. I suffer from bad anxiety and PTSD so I can totally relate to your post in certain regard. But please try to go a bit easy on your fear factor. Perhaps, In you free time try to keep your immune system strong. Take vitamins and a few immune boosting supplements such as echinacea, ginseng, zinc, and some oil of oregano. Try to also increase your vitamin C intake-but mostly try to keep the demons in your mind at bay. The stress of this is immune system lowering so please find time to meditate or just chill out! Walk out side breath deep in through the nose and out through the mouth.... repeat....It sounds as though you fear is really the biggest issue here though.....which I totally understand. I really feel for you! But be strong and remember what you are doing is so absolutely ROCK SOLID. You have a lot of support....and most importantly you are not alone!
