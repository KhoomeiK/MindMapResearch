motherlessdaughters,fnyeywu,t3_g44zn1,1587361121.0,"I lost my mom when I was eleven and I'm sixteen now. After reading this post, I realized that I have initially gravitated towards the mom-friend of the group but they aren't often my closest friends. My closest friends tend to have divorced parents or chaotic homes and I think its because its easier to identify, share, and feel understood with them."
motherlessdaughters,fluupw7,t3_fr7o1g,1585510436.0,"I lost my mom about five years ago, I'm sixteen now. The crying didn't stop for a really long time. I'd look up at the clouds, I'd see her favorite pajamas, I'd find a pretty flower in the backyard and the tears would fall. Every little thing was a reminder of who I lost and the love that I'd never feel again. I cried in the middle of class, I cried at night, I cried all the time.

One thing that no one told me was that it was okay. That its okay to cry and feel all the pain. That its okay if you can't get out of bed. That its okay to not be okay. 

The crying doesn't stop, but it does lessen over time. There's a really good analogy of grief called the ball and box analogy that explains how you can't just get over it and move on. I discovered it earlier this year exactly at a time when I was wondering the same thing: when will the crying stop, why haven't i gotten over it yet? The analogy made it make more sense so maybe check it out, up to you.

But I guess just know that its perfectly fine to cry and hurt and be angry and feel lost and hopeless. And its okay to cry some more after that.

Sending you lots of love <3"

I had no idea how much stress and unhappiness it was causing me. Seeing friends with each other and finding pictures of everyone laughing, knowing that I'll never have that, it was terrible. Actual hell seeing all of that and subconsciously making those expectations for myself. 
Get rid of the things that make you feel like shit."
