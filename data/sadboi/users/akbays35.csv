timetravel,f2hsbtq,t1_f2hp9e7,1570247579.0,"Time travel has already happened, but it doesn't do anything because of Quantum (actual) physics. Our universe isn't singular, it's infinitely layered. Every time traveler has killed Hitler, his grandpa, and the first human to walk the planet. The reason why this doesn't affect anything is Quantum Stitching, ""Time"" just consolidates and events occur within a ""narrative possibility of infinites"" it's hard to explain, it's like fate but less hokey and there's weird equative math like 2+2=4=6-2 (mandela effect, but it's not just a faulty memory there's bizarre equals). Time isn't a line, it's like a yarn ball or a russian nesting doll so if you try to mess with time, there's an infinite amount of unmess to resolve it. This is also why predicting the future or going into the future is useless as well, you may just be going into an unresolved infinite possibility and your actions will have a 0 sum result."

timetravel,f2he0m6,t3_dd7hac,1570242516.0,"Problem I have with UFO's is that they break any physical measurement we have to detect them. Personally I think it's people chasing reflected lights or something like that. If sonar doesn't even pick up motion or disruption in the air from a fast moving UFO is it even flying? The problem with ""artificial gravity"" is that it's just a dark matter condensation, but it does ""weird stuff"" to radiation that physicist would detect. Electrical discharges would make the object incredibly loud like a tazer or tesla coil. Most Paradimensionals have already genetically acclimated to this planet there really isn't much a point in ""abductions"" either they are actually quite stupid in many cases. The government mostly just covers it up because it would be too much of a bother to explain, it's bad enough that most of us have insurance and doctors ""refuse"" to treat us since they barely understand human biology."

Don't let the NORMIES win, be yourself and accept it as part of who you are. Depressed people are not the problem the whole world is insane and it's just making you doubt yourself. That being said I recommend ignoring taking antidepressants if they aren't working and go with a stimulant to make you function. I calm down with knowledge too, it helps I feel like I'm having a mental chess battle. You may not fully realize what's going on, but your brain might just have communicative issues and does this bizarre warfare. The left eye sometimes doesn't see what the right eye sees."
