relationship_advice,fr1qw2c,t1_fr16smp,1589824414.0,"From a stay at home mom who tried to do the divorce DIY, DO NOT DO THAT. Absolutely get a lawyer. It’s about 50/50 on lawyers who charge a fee for consultations. A good lawyer is worth their weight in gold. My lawyer was amazing. I wasn’t trying to fuck my ex over, I just wanted what I was legally entitled to! And I got it. I got spousal support, half of his retirement rolled into my own, 50/50 custody, etc. 

Gather as much info as you can as far as bank statements, mortgage papers, ALL debt and assets, retirement, taxes, etc. Having these will help your case. Tell your  lawyer what you want. There are protections and social services available to you, educate yourself so you can make the best decisions for you and the kids. Good luck❤️"
StrongCurves,fqg0ky8,t1_fqe6xrq,1589335442.0,"This is me, too. I’ve done a couple of figure competitions (you can check my post history), what you can do is back off your leg work a bit and focus more on upper body. I had two back and two shoulder days, only one leg day. I had one heavy day (rep range 4-6), and a high rep day (reps 15-30). I saw incredible growth in my lats and shoulders. 

I also backed off a lot of quad exercises and focused on hamstrings/weak gluteal points, and abs. This helped balance me out muscle-wise, so when I shredded for my competition my legs were more defined yet didn’t take over my physique, and my shoulders were 😍

You look fantastic! Keep up the good work."

I was tired, which makes it harder for me to regulate my emotions, and as I was in this emotional tizzy, I was able to stop and calm myself down! I breathed, consciously relaxed my shoulders. I was honestly a bit shocked at the tension that was throughout my entire body. I had never really realized it till that moment. 

Recognize the times you DO have improvements. Yesterday I thought “wow this is working!” during that situation, bc in the past I would have spent the rest of the evening, or at least hours, in that heightened emotional state.

politics,flrg1vf,t1_flqinq3,1585419460.0,"I work for an MD in a city of 300-400k. We both became very sick, doctor was worried bc she saw patients the week before. We immediately close the clinic (this was way before any mandates), she calls the CDC and her doctor friends at the hospital. She doesn’t fit the CDC criteria even tho she is a provider who has had recent contact with patients. So into self quarantine we both go. 

That was over two weeks ago. After having low oxygen, tachycardia, and almost going to the ER, they finally relent and give her one of the 800 tests that was given to our state. It came back negative, but there have been many false negatives on those shot tests, plus perhaps her viral load is just low. Who knows? She and her doc friends are all certain we both have it. 

We also have many, many high risk patients who have gotten ill, all with the same/similar symptoms. Almost none of them can get tests bc they don’t “qualify...” aka aren’t quite sick enough. Last I heard from the hospital, which was a memo last week, there were 400 tests left in my city. They did set up one drive thru testing center, but it is a HUGE pain. 

Trump is a liar. It’s right there in black and white! I cannot comprehend the mental gymnastics it takes to hear “MILLIONS OF BEAUTIFUL PERFECT TESTS” and then to hear, hey actually we only have 800 tests for an entire state! And we haven’t received any more!!"

Keep your wits about you, especially when drinking downtown. There are regular stabbings/shootings at the bars, and clubs are constantly closing bc of the violence.

So when we cross over to thriving mode, all that crap we’ve suppressed just to live comes bubbling up. It’s exhausting and supremely frustrating. I’m 32, with my own business and single mom to two gorgeous, healthy kids, I have an amazing boyfriend that I have a hard time trusting bc of my past issues. It sucks. I’m considering breaking up so he just doesn’t have to deal with my BS anymore. If I’m sick and tired of it I can’t think what he must deal with, with these annoying, random mood swings and such. He tries his best to assure me, and I’ll feel ok for a day or two, then the cycle happens all over again!!! 

I found the one thing that has ever really helped was tripping on mushrooms. Wow. I had a great trip, and felt AMAZING for MONTHS. I’m talking no anxiety/panic attacks, no consuming anxiety, I wasn’t in my own head and freaking out over every little thing. I was more patient and kind w the kids.

I don’t mind washing, drying, and folding for you, but be a grown man and throw them in the hamper please.”

But the more money I made the more he’d make me pay towards bills. He’d go over the CC statement and go line by line and make me hand over money for food, diapers, etc. I was being abused financially, mentally, emotionally. He berated me for everything. House was dirty, kids behaved badly, my food sucked. He started eating out for every meal. Oh yeah, AND he was cheating on me w other men for our entire relationship! 

I finally couldn’t handle it. I called a local abused women’s shelter and got the fuck out! I was able to live w a friend w my kids for two months while I worked my ass off to save money. If you go to a shelter they will help you fill out paperwork. I took a month of welfare, also got food stamps, child care assistance, etc. When you go to court to divorce his ass you will get alimony. There’s also a possibility of getting him to pay for and support you while you go back to school. 

You are worth so much more than this. For your health and safety, and for your kids, you need to leave. You CAN do this. He’s told you for years how terrible you are. But guess what?? He’s a fucking liar. You are amazing and a badass, and someday you will be thriving, not just surviving.

Your body cannot make something out off nothing. Muscle won’t appear. You have to feed those muscles with good nutrition and shape them with weightlifting. Back off on cardio. Cardio is necessary for overall health, but if you’re doing that much cardio, you need to eat even more or you’re just spinning your wheels. 

I was terrified to eat more. But when I got serious about lifting I had to get serious about nutrition. A good place to start is eating 1g protein per lbs of body weight. If you’re 134lbs, eat 134g protein. You can look through my post history to see my transformation. I was eating nearly 2500 cals/day and lifting 5-6 days a week with about 10-12m of HIIT cardio couple times a week. For reference I’m just under 5’4” and when transforming about 140 lbs to start. 

Also, be gentle w yourself. Building muscle, esp for women, takes time. You have a great base now of consistency, which is HUGE. I know this sub hates on personal trainers, but what took my fitness to the next level was hiring an experienced, knowledgable trainer. A good trainer will show you proper form, will push you out of your comfort zone, and will take you to the next level. I love fitness so much that at 30yrs old became a trainer myself! I love training and fitness, it completely changed my life and who I am. I have helped transform lives, and nothing has given me so much satisfaction.

I wish I had those journals detailing the abuse, and that I could have given them to someone.

Unfortunately it didn’t last too long bc step mom became enraged I was doing so well and wanted me to be w friends or family that were also being manipulated by her.

TwoXSex,f870uvh,t3_dza5y1,1574312253.0,"You can do whatever you want. I change it up a lot. Sometimes I’ll grow it out a bit, sometimes I shave completely. I try to keep in mind that my lover’s face will be down there, so I keep it trimmed and neat. As someone who enjoys both men and women I will say I like having it a bit more trim as everything is easier to access. And as a women I can tell you shaving the undercarriage will make it much more pleasurable (can actually feel tongue and everything on skin without a hair barrier), but like to keep some up top."

exchristian,f3u1jug,t1_f3rh35o,1571150961.0,"So true. My stepmom was a narcissist who relentlessly abused me and my sisters. I finally, blissfully went no contact in my late 20s. She then spent the next 2-3 yrs trying to look like a saint. She used my dad, her enabler, to call me and tell me how “sorry” she was, and when can we “just bury the hatchet?” You know what, NEVER. I work my ass off in therapy so I’m not like her, so I don’t have to carry those wounds around forever. My life has only improved since."
raisedbynarcissists,f33mhnp,t1_f32qrdx,1570641166.0,Your child would be better off never seeing her. Don’t ever feel like you have to facilitate that relationship. Especially if she’s threatened you.... that’s grounds for NC. You don’t need that. Your child definitely doesn’t need that.
StrongCurves,f32nyb5,t3_dfel25,1570619821.0,"Naw. No guilt required. You needed a bit of a break. Our bodies and minds can only handle so much stress, and sometimes something just has to give. Now you have more time so get back to it!☺️"
SAHP,f2zynnu,t3_det323,1570542178.0,"And thats why I got a divorce☺️ Besides the whole cheating thing which was bad enough, he was a huge dick who never helped, didn’t even fucking clean up after himself, while I stayed home and did 100% of all house and child care. He’d go to bars with friends, took vacations out of state and fishing trips overnight while I wasn’t allowed to even go get coffee or a movie w a friend or by myself unless someone else watched the kids. Even then I was “selfish, bad mom.” It was such enraging bullshit. Talking doesn’t help, bc these men don’t care about their women getting free time, that’s what we are there for, to serve them and the children. It’s a respect issue. Now he is forced to take care of his own children :) I’m 1000x happier, I have total control of my finances and my life like never before."

relationships,f2ridf5,t3_ddyz2z,1570373352.0,"I dunno. I never got over it when I found my ex husband had cheated on me over our entire relationship. He was pissed I wasnt over it within a couple weeks. Till the day I left (about a year later) he absolutely disgusted me. I did have sex with him, but I was never aroused and we had to use lube for the first time. I couldn’t even look at him during, I’d close my eyes or look elsewhere. 

The fact he did it 3 more times, lied, etc, and now is pressuring you shows he has no remorse. Has he done anything to try to mend the relationship? Are y’all in therapy? Are you happy? It’s your decision obviously, but I vowed I’d never be w a cheater again. Maybe some people can get over that, but the cheating mixed with lying just isn’t something I can get over or work through."

It took becoming a mother myself, and being verbally, mentally, and emotionally abused in front of my infant daughter for me to think.... wtf I don’t have to take their shit. And I will NEVER let that woman get her claws into my sweet baby girl. It made me finally call everything I’d been through since I was 10 “abuse.” It was a huge moment for me. Good for you.

xxfitness,f2kiiu3,t3_ddkvfz,1570285912.0,"Honestly, people just have to find out for themselves. You have to be ready to make that change. And it takes trial and error. Does she have binge eating disorder? It’s possible she DOES eat 1k calories a day but then has huge binges that puts her over. Classic restrict/binge cycle. Be gentle and be there for her. Someday hopefully it’ll click for her. I’m a personal trainer and I can’t tell you how many clients I have that SWEAR up and down they “eat healthy” yet are overweight or obese. They neglect to acknowledge that they drink frappes from Starbucks every morning, or drink and eat excessively on weekends. I can’t force anyone. All I can do is gently ask questions from time to time and lead them to the answer in a roundabout way. When you confront someone head on they will become defensive and possibly cut you out. Just continue to be her friend and if she asks questions about how you’re able to lose and she can’t, ask how she does on the weekends or when she’s stressed, etc. just be her friend. You’re not responsible for her weight loss and eating habits, she is."

I only left bc my own business took off. F45 trainers really care. They will make time to talk to you about your injuries, your goals, what you like or don’t like. We LOVE our members.

I left my husband 2 yrs ago (also for long term infidelity among other things), and I thought I’d never recover. I drank a lot. I cried and screamed and worked my ass off to provide for myself and my two children. I trusted my lawyer and got through it.  Now my life is amazing. I still have to work with a therapist now and then, but my business is taking off, I’m dating again, and the kids are happier not being subjected to a toxic household.

I've told her the few stories I actually remember that aren't shitty. Then I just make up stories about princesses and superheroes and villains."

32 yr old mom of two, just under 5’4”, not sure of weight, it’s been fluctuating around 130ish. I haven’t been working out much lately as my business has really taken off, and being a single mom with a growing business is hard! My diet has also been out of wack, I’ve been dating again and partying a bit when my kids are with their dad so that means alcohol. Just this morning I decided it’s time to start to clean up the diet and get back on the gym wagon! This is my enjoying life body, and it’s been amazing. But I miss the gym and miss feeling healthy!"

exchristian,evdzui3,t1_evdtvj5,1564451730.0,"Complete, blind devotion and obedience to parents. We never had any discussions, what they decided was law. My kids are 5 and 7 and from the time they were babies I talked to them and told them my “why” behind my rules. Most rules are open to negotiation. 

I don’t hit my children, and especially not with items designed to maximize pain. I have spanked my kids,
It’s been few and far between, and I’ve always regretted it. It was how I was raised (also in an angry, controlling household), and I’m working w a therapist on my parenting skills and anger management. 

“Happy heart.” Fuck that shit. Sometimes you feel like crap, and you need to be able to talk about it. Kids have lots of feelings, and telling them “first time obedience w a happy heart!!!” Is sooo not helpful!! Again, I try to TALK to my kids. 


Control and abuse generally don’t foster a sense of peace, calm, and trust. So,  basically everything my parents did I do the opposite 😁"
exchristian,evda6rr,t3_cjek49,1564433537.0,"Yes!! I just listened to the podcast today. 

I was raised this way. We had a “whacker,” which they either recommended or sold? I’m not sure, but it was a thick piece of rubber that my step mom would hit me and my sisters with. It left huge bruises and welts for days. 

When I had my first child step mom and dad sent me the “Babywise” books by the same author which I promptly and happily threw in the fucking garbage. Absolutely disgusting “parenting” books. 

I was very traumatized by the growing kids parenting “style,” and it took years of therapy to undo (still working on it in my 30s actually)."

TwoXSex,etgtkwo,t1_eteopo4,1562798575.0,"Why in the world would you hate yourself for using a medication you needed? It didn’t work out well obviously but how would you have known that?! You didn’t intentionally do this to yourself. 

As far as your bf, if he leaves you or gets upset over a medical condition, let him go. You don’t need that shit in your life. You need a supportive partner who will help you through this. You can still have a romantic day, eat some snacks in bed while you watch Netflix. He can hold and kiss you and rub your back.... there’s a lot of physical things you can do that are not PIV. 

I understand anxiety and depression, I’m just coming out of a 6 month spiral. Are you seeing a therapist? Talk nicely to yourself. Instead of “I fucked up I’m such an idiot my bf will hate me...” try “wow this situation is hard, but it’s not permanent. I did what I thought was right, it didn’t quite turn out, and now I know not to use Monistat again. I will heal and recover. I’ll talk to my bf and tell him I need support, we won’t be able to have PIV at this time, but we can come up with other sexy/romantic things to do. He is so sweet I can’t wait for him to hold me and help me relax a little. Until then I’m just gonna take care of my beautiful badass self!”"
