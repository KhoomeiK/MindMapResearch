I wasn‚Äôt trying to fuck my ex over, I just wanted what I was legally entitled to! And I got it. I got spousal support, half of his retirement rolled into my own, 50/50 custody, etc. 

Gather as much info as you can as far as bank statements, mortgage papers, ALL debt and assets, retirement, taxes, etc. Having these will help your case. Tell your  lawyer what you want. There are protections and social services available to you, educate yourself so you can make the best decisions for you and the kids. Good luck‚ù§Ô∏è"

We immediately close the clinic (this was way before any mandates), she calls the CDC and her doctor friends at the hospital. She doesn‚Äôt fit the CDC criteria even tho she is a provider who has had recent contact with patients. So into self quarantine we both go. 

That was over two weeks ago. After having low oxygen, tachycardia, and almost going to the ER, they finally relent and give her one of the 800 tests that was given to our state. It came back negative, but there have been many false negatives on those shot tests, plus perhaps her viral load is just low. Who knows? She and her doc friends are all certain we both have it.

Your body cannot make something out off nothing. Muscle won‚Äôt appear. You have to feed those muscles with good nutrition and shape them with weightlifting. Back off on cardio. Cardio is necessary for overall health, but if you‚Äôre doing that much cardio, you need to eat even more or you‚Äôre just spinning your wheels. 

I was terrified to eat more. But when I got serious about lifting I had to get serious about nutrition. A good place to start is eating 1g protein per lbs of body weight. If you‚Äôre 134lbs, eat 134g protein. You can look through my post history to see my transformation. I was eating nearly 2500 cals/day and lifting 5-6 days a week with about 10-12m of HIIT cardio couple times a week. For reference I‚Äôm just under 5‚Äô4‚Äù and when transforming about 140 lbs to start. 

Also, be gentle w yourself. Building muscle, esp for women, takes time. You have a great base now of consistency, which is HUGE. I know this sub hates on personal trainers, but what took my fitness to the next level was hiring an experienced, knowledgable trainer. A good trainer will show you proper form, will push you out of your comfort zone, and will take you to the next level. I love fitness so much that at 30yrs old became a trainer myself!

‚ÄúSorry, have to work.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm ok thanks, can‚Äôt make it.‚Äù

You are able to block phone numbers and people on social media. Why are you allowing your dad to bully you? Hang up if he gets annoying. Don‚Äôt respond to texts,  delete them. Be a grown up. Who gives a flying fuck what they say behind your back? How does it even affect your daily life? It‚Äôs time to be a big girl. I know it sucks, I went no contact with my dad and stepmom because they are annoying and judgmental and abusive. I spend my precious time and money on people who love and respect me."
CPTSD,f8ma6df,t3_e0zi10,1574629555.0,"This is such fantastic advice. My advice in addition would be to make sure that you keep the evidence far away from home. My narcissistic step mom seemed to find my journal no matter where I hid it. She‚Äôs make me read it, humiliate me, and make me tear out pages. 

I wish I had those journals detailing the abuse, and that I could have given them to someone. I did go to a school counselor after I tried to self harm, and was able to get out of their house and live with a trusted adult who was not in my step moms reach. Unfortunately it didn‚Äôt last too long bc step mom became enraged I was doing so well and wanted me to be w friends or family that were also being manipulated by her. 

Childhood was rough, but I‚Äôm grateful I got out. I‚Äôm now a business owner, mom, and have amazing friends. There is hope. Just keep living, your focus on surviving one more day, and eventually you will be out and you will find your own family in whatever form that takes."

I try to keep in mind that my lover‚Äôs face will be down there, so I keep it trimmed and neat. As someone who enjoys both men and women I will say I like having it a bit more trim as everything is easier to access. And as a women I can tell you shaving the undercarriage will make it much more pleasurable (can actually feel tongue and everything on skin without a hair barrier), but like to keep some up top."

I did have sex with him, but I was never aroused and we had to use lube for the first time. I couldn‚Äôt even look at him during, I‚Äôd close my eyes or look elsewhere. 

The fact he did it 3 more times, lied, etc, and now is pressuring you shows he has no remorse. Has he done anything to try to mend the relationship? Are y‚Äôall in therapy? Are you happy?

xxfitness,f2kiiu3,t3_ddkvfz,1570285912.0,"Honestly, people just have to find out for themselves. You have to be ready to make that change. And it takes trial and error.

They neglect to acknowledge that they drink frappes from Starbucks every morning, or drink and eat excessively on weekends. I can‚Äôt force anyone. All I can do is gently ask questions from time to time and lead them to the answer in a roundabout way. When you confront someone head on they will become defensive and possibly cut you out. Just continue to be her friend and if she asks questions about how you‚Äôre able to lose and she can‚Äôt, ask how she does on the weekends or when she‚Äôs stressed, etc. just be her friend.
