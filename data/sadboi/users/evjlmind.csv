AskReddit,fpmeutt,t3_gdzb3i,1588731542.0,"for saying “stop touching my shit” like yeah yeah i cursed but like these two girls kept touching my stuff, ruining it, ripping it, moving it. i got angry and lost control and my teacher only got mad at me and didn’t even reprimand them for what they did which is unfair to me"
BergenTechBT,fpmego1,t1_fpme1mm,1588731299.0,i applied for the hard and popular majors so i’m not surprised since there was prob so much competition. but i’m glad you got in :)
BergenTechBT,fpme8vn,t1_fpme1mm,1588731164.0,sadly no. they only took 1 student each for bct and bca. so many of my intelligent and talented friends didn’t get in which is surprising since they were all pretty much on the same level. the one who got into bca was a genius since i knew him. i helped him apply and im so happy he got in bc he deserved it. they only took boys from our town and only 1 for each school. i guess it’s bc of my town population and not many people applied.
