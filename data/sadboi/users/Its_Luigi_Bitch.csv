Nintendo 3DS... probably would say Story of Seasons: Trio of Towns.

DS... lots of people love Harvest Moon DS or DS Cute (if you wanna play as a girl; but most people hate the DS Cute bachelors).

Wii? Animal Parade. Tree of Tranquility is also quite good, but most people agree Animal Parade improved on a lot of things that Tree of Tranquility did.

As for Rune Factory, a lot of people find 3 (for the DS) and 4 (for the 3DS or the Switch) to be the best in the series to date and would probably recommend either of those over any of the Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons games. I've yet to play either, so I can't really comment."

Story of Seasons improves upon a lot of things A New Beginning started. The town has a set layout, though, and the goals are a lot more vague and ill-defined (especially unlocking the last two trading vendors).

Even Luna/Gill and Julius/Candace have potential, but like you said - with only two heart events per rival couple, there's just not a ton of room to develop them before they tie the knot. At least Anissa/Jin, Phoebe/Calvin, and Toby/Renee are perfectly adorable though.

harvestmoon,fquusl4,t3_gl1sek,1589664874.0,"Magical Melody's ""heart events"" really aren't similar to other games. Honestly, it's basically just that you get gifts from people at different heart levels and then a letter. I know every single marriage candidate in the game, male and female, gives you a gift when you get each of them to about roughly 2-2.5 hearts (it's required if you want to get all of the notes). And then the opposite-sex candidates give you gifts again (or just visit you, I forget) when you get each of them to 5 hearts.

And then at some point, I forget when (maybe 7 hearts?), you get a letter from them.

So basically, you just... activate her ""heart events"" by giving her gifts she likes. And going to festivals with her where applicable. It's not like other games where you need to be at a specific place at a specific time.

As for rival events, I forget if hers happens in the tool shop or at Ellen's ranch, since it's Blue. BUT, there's no rival marriage in this game (at least in the English versions; I heard there *was* rival marriage in the Japanese version and it got removed for the US. Can anyone familiar with the Japanese version confirm or deny this?). So even if you see Ann and Blue's rival event, you don't have to worry.
