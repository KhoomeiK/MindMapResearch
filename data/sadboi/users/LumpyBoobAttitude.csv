You guys don’t have to like my view or agree with it, that’s your opinion, but I’m not going to change mine. I see Lori, as toxic as she is, as a victim to this culture (we as women all are); it’s extremely hard not to given all she has said about her life and how her husband’s influence has changed her inside-out."

religiousfruitcake,fpuwtkm,t1_fpuw9tm,1588926490.0,"She’s been utterly brainwashed. If my comment wasn’t clear enough for everyone: her husband radicalized her into believing that women must be subservient to men.

It goes beyond the bedroom. The marital rape is just an example. She also advises women who reach out to her for help regarding the subject of having sex with your husband when you don’t want to, and she tells them that it is their duty and that we must all do things that we don’t want to do sometimes. Those women don’t want to give into their husband’s demands, they feel conflicted about submission, and Lori pushes them over the cliff that lands them in a place where they can no longer say “no”, lest they go to hell.

It’s not a kink, it’s a deeply-ingrained system of abuse that women suffer from the most. That is what Christian Fundamentalism encompasses. 

If you so much as used the word “kink” around Lori, you would be told you’re going straight to hell for using that language. This isn’t about preferences, it’s about control."
religiousfruitcake,fpuvx46,t1_fpuvtdo,1588925565.0,Forced female subjugation and it’s okay because “God” said so.
religiousfruitcake,fputf3o,t1_fpupbgb,1588923089.0,"Lori submits herself to her husband completely.
So, when he wants to have sex and she doesn’t, she still complies with his demands to have sex. She is “transformed” because she did not always follow this belief system. After marrying him is when she became radicalized in her belief of female submission (among other things). Her husband is basically her puppeteer. 

It goes deeper than that but I can’t think too long about this woman or her husband, otherwise I get legitimately pissed.

Edit: This is *not* a preference/kink situation. This is about female subjugation and control exercised through misogyny. Lori has been brainwashed and that is why she is content to submit to her husband, not because she gets off on it (if she gets off at all). By implying that this is somehow empowering for her, we put countless women in her position at risk of being victim-blamed, should they ever come forward."
religiousfruitcake,fpuscog,t1_fn9jzno,1588922071.0,"Just for your own well-being...there is nothing wrong with collecting disability if you qualify, because that means you have a legitimate disability. So if your pride is what’s holding you back from receiving assistance to leave this dead-end job that you hate and focus on your health and the health of loved ones, then that is a personal failure and I’m sorry. It actually takes a good amount of character to admit that you need help, and to accept it. Don’t act like receiving disability is leeching or makes someone less-than, quite the contrary. 

Also, it’s extremely difficult to get accepted into disability programs. I’m not sure who you’ve spoken to, but it is definitely not as easy or simple as just saying “I’m an alcoholic” to get onto disability."
religiousfruitcake,fpury08,t1_fn8wu46,1588921682.0,"As someone on disability, it’s kind of scary that this dude actually thinks you can collect disability for being an alcoholic.
