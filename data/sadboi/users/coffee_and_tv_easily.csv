greysanatomy,fr09i4p,t3_glu3wn,1589787959.0,"I am on my first watch of Greys and I was so annoyed watching that storyline. I was ranting to my husband about how unprofessional and unethical it was and the fact that no one but Alex called her out on it was unbelievable. When he did, it was treated as though he was just jealous when in fact he’s the only one that was right!! The fact she didn’t get sacked for that is crazy"
greysanatomy,fr098xl,t3_glq2ky,1589787723.0,I really liked it! I found it a bit weird at first but once I realised what was going on it was good. They’ve all got great voices!
greysanatomy,fr091ke,t1_fqwyuhi,1589787536.0,Oh no!! I’ve been resisting any temptation to google anything because I know that will happen to me too!! What a roller coaster this show is - I love it!!
greysanatomy,fqwnfb0,t1_fqw9j1w,1589710944.0,Definitely need both of those!! Never have I been taken on such a roller coaster by a show!
greysanatomy,fqwne0m,t3_glabri,1589710907.0,I’d never seen it until a few months ago - I’m about to start season 13!! I feel like I want to rewatch it again when I finish!
greysanatomy,fpr5mkh,t3_gefoed,1588843259.0,That’s exactly what my husband said when he saw her too!
Bones,fpn9dz7,t3_gebipe,1588754829.0,"I loved Sweets, his death always makes me cry!! It felt so half assed though - it should have been better than it was! At least show the whole fight!! I wanted to hate Aubrey because of the way he was introduced but I couldn’t help loving him"
Bones,fomkhs5,t1_foh1svc,1587893438.0,Those two are definitely my favourites!!
Bones,fngqvpy,t3_g1cx1l,1586941598.0,I thought that I read somewhere that he wanted to stop acting to concentrate on school or something but I may be imagining it!
Bones,fngqsyb,t3_g1esyy,1586941519.0,I genuinely do not enjoy that episode. I actually skipped it on this rewatch because I couldn’t deal with watching it again

AskReddit,fmhf86k,t1_fmgyt54,1586077669.0,I’m so late to Greys Anatomy that I only started watching it this week. I’ve been binge watching it though because as you said it totally pulls you in. It’s so good and well made

Bones,fmamjkc,t3_fu0dvy,1585899429.0,The first episode of season 10 gets me every time! I found it really hard to like Aubrey first time round because of when he was introduced but this time around I like him more
Bones,fm8452r,t3_ftl343,1585842459.0,That would be so good!
Bones,fm7d8yi,t1_fm7acyf,1585822548.0,I also really enjoy any where they go undercover - their alter egos are so good!
Bones,fm7cyuc,t1_fm7acyf,1585822224.0,"It’s so hard to choose a favourite! Aliens in a spaceship is definitely one, the man in the fallout shelter, The Hero in the hold and the doctor in the photo are high on my list too!
I enjoyed the uk ones, along with loving Vincent and Gordon partly due to loving hearing a British accent - being British it was just nice!"
Bones,fm78p2e,t3_ftitak,1585817361.0,It’s my favourite tv show! I’m on my second consecutive rewatch now and I enjoyed it just as much each time!
Bones,fm787hb,t1_fm780mu,1585816830.0,Plus that episode is one of the ones that really stays in your memory!

Bones,fm77z0i,t3_ftilog,1585816578.0,"Sounds like The Hole In The Heart. Episode 22 of season 6.
Booth faces off against Broadsky at a docks so it sounds like this"
Bones,fm02o2q,t3_frwkxm,1585642321.0,It always makes me cry. Sweets was one of my favourites so it hits hard. I found it really difficult to like Aubrey because he felt like a terrible Sweets replacement but I did come to love him  - just not as much as Sweets!
Bones,fki72se,t1_fkg9eok,1584213200.0,I hadn’t noticed it either until I read this
Bones,fk72bzk,t1_fk4ygxu,1583925514.0,I watched this yesterday and remembered how much I enjoy it. The whole change of POV through the episode is so good
Bones,fk3lczz,t3_fg7kxf,1583838555.0,I don’t like her. I find her attitude and personality to be irritating and she just doesn’t seem to have much of a sense of humour at all
Bones,fk3l8yp,t3_fg7pcc,1583838435.0,I didn’t like her. Partly because Booth didn’t belong with her but also because I just found her a little bit irritating
Bones,fk3l6sc,t3_fg93yo,1583838371.0,"I find it really hard to choose a favourite because I love the show.
If I had to choose a few to name then I’d say
Aliens in a Spaceship
Patriot in the Purgatory
Double death of the dearly departed"
Bones,fjx8ueo,t1_fjwd93w,1583662339.0,I agree with this completely and I loved your last paragraph!
Bones,fj65vbe,t1_fj57pjp,1583058251.0,That’s probably my favourite too!

Bones,fidts1l,t3_f7jg47,1582371290.0,I watch it every day  - I finally finished it a while back and I just went straight back to the beginning. My husband says I watch it too much but I disagree - I just enjoy it and find it better than much of what is on tv at the moment
Bones,fi9uqdr,t3_f76d5d,1582283205.0,"He is just so lovely and sweet. The way he spouts all his random facts to help himself think better always makes me smile!! 
I was so sad when he died partly because I loved the character and also because those final scenes were just heartbreaking"

AskReddit,fhxlt7m,t3_f5b9k4,1581957243.0,They are big on attention seeking and needy. I find it really exhausting at times to deal with it
Bones,fhxcci4,t3_f4yhwm,1581950925.0,"Definitely not for me. I was rooting for them to get together from the beginning and I loved seeing their relationship evolve. 
They are great together because they just seem to balance each other out and they are both really good for each other"
Bones,fhxc6n3,t3_f50z3e,1581950804.0,It’s between Vincent and Wendell for me. Vincent was lovely and so typically English that as a fellow Brit I really enjoyed that. Wendell was a really nice person and so down-to-earth that he was enjoyable to watch
Bones,fhxbw48,t1_fhv8wsm,1581950584.0,"Yeah I didn’t like her much either, there was just something about her"
Bones,fhu01fv,t3_f2yto3,1581880221.0,I rewatched Santa In The Slush today and I remembered how much I loved the ending where Booth and Parker get to be together and take the Christmas tree outside the prison for Brennan and her family

AskReddit,fhkfk4b,t1_fhkf69y,1581681708.0,Absolutely this! Those people that take advantage of those that do not have the emotional and mental maturity to make those decisions and in the wrong. I have teenagers and whilst my youngest looks mature she is still lacking a wider maturity
AskReddit,fhkfg5g,t1_fhkf4h4,1581681582.0,"I find that pretty shocking though personally, I don’t feel that a child that young can possibly make that decision and fully understand it to be honest. I have a daughter and even at 15 she has a lot of growing up left to do and lacks a certain amount of emotional maturity because she’s still a child"
AskReddit,fhkf09p,t1_fhkeagp,1581681062.0,Yeah kids is probably a better word. If I’m honest though even where the age of consent is 14 I would still find an adult being attracted to a 14 year old messed up even if they are “legal” because they are definitely still kids at 14 - just my personal opinion
AskReddit,fhkdx10,t1_fhkdpgy,1581679694.0,This is exactly right. The ages involved make a difference to how it should be dealt with
AskReddit,fhkdtst,t1_fhkdmg8,1581679575.0,"You are just using an extreme example though. Children go through puberty well under the age of 17 even so yes given that it covers 14/15/16 years olds then it is wrong! 
Obviously an 18 year old finding a 17 year old attractive is pretty tame but at the other extent is adults finding 14 year olds attractive which is unnatural whatever way you look at it"
