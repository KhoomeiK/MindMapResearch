Looking for recommendations on affordable full face helmets in Australia. Most I‚Äôve looked at are $400-500.

An alternative to the super expensive skate helmets is a full face mtb helmet. I can pick up a decent brand like bell or rjays for about $120.

Or just get a motorbike helmet for about $70. Not Keen on the size and weight factor though.

I came back positive for inflammation on my system but it was a low level.
I found info about the correlation between PTSD and muscular injuries and thought it may be relevant. Something about being stressed and constantly tensioning muscles leads to more frequent injuries.

It didn't happen every morning, but when it did it was terrifying. 
My memory has improved. Not as good as it was, but it was photographic. Now it's just as slightly worse than ""normal"".

To be honest the best thing I ever did was take up an interest in philosophy. Examined my life and my perspective on things. Questioned myself and made attempts to improve myself. I found some areas of philosophy that really clicked with me and committed to trying to live that way. It took time and effort but I am much more resilient now.

I can see flashes of the moon go past but the correct alignment appears to require micrometre level adjustment. Even when I had it in the holder and actually had my ball of light when it was set up too close, just touching the phone screen would move it out of place. 

To line it up would you generally put the phone up to the eyepiece and then move it around, or lime it up from a distance and move it closer?

I thought I had a winner for moment with the latter but the very slightest movement and I lost the image and could not find it again.

But thanks for pointing it out all the same. You are right, it is a relevant impact."
AusFinance,erttawp,t1_ertql4i,1561252625.0,"Look, I'm sure you are actually a very nice person in real life and that you just become mean when you are on the internet. It's ok. It's quite common. And I forgive you.

Perhaps I went to far identifying the issue with your comment. If so, I apologise. You are obviously very knowledgeable in relation to tax issues and I appreciate your input. It's all too common to make claims that can't be supported. We are all only human. As you say, you don't know the specifics so I wouldn't expect you to be able to say for certain it would have improved my position. 

Thanks for taking the time to comment. I wish you all the best."
AusFinance,ertq7gi,t1_ertpyds,1561249887.0,Thanks so much for taking the time to write this comment. I appreciate the advice. I will more than likely see an accountant for the next financial year once the flat is generating an income.
AusFinance,ertpza3,t1_ertpx8d,1561249685.0,Thank you
AusFinance,ertprhm,t1_ertolpg,1561249499.0,Yes. I am pointing out the inconsistencies in our tax system.
AusFinance,ertpphp,t1_ertpnaa,1561249453.0,And how would this have improved my current financial position?
AusFinance,ertpnwv,t1_ertphv7,1561249415.0,"You mean you don't have anything to back up your statement? 
Refer to Hitchens razor."
AusFinance,ertphh8,t1_ertpaaj,1561249262.0,But how would it have improved my current position. I would be in the same position minus the cost of the accountant.
AusFinance,ertpcbc,t1_erto8pv,1561249136.0,"I appreciate the information you provided in your comments. But you have not really outlined any legitimate reason for your claim that I would have been better served seeing an accountant first.

I said I was willing to go ahead with the build regardless of the ability to claim. This means, based on my calculations of buildings costs vs income (less ongoing expenses and tax) I was happy with the outcome. Any ability to claim was just an extra benefit.

So, that being the case, how would I have been in a better position if I engaged an accountant?

I would have still proceeded with the build. The build would have cost the same amount. I would still be looking at renting it for market value.

Am I ignorant of many of the nuances of our tax system? Yes. 

Does that mean I need an accountant to tell me if spending $15,000 of spare cash in total for a gross annual income of $17,000 per year is a good idea? I don't think so. 

That's pretty good return on investment by any measure. Plus the added benefit of increasing value to my home in the event that we sell.

So if you could please explain to me how seeing an accountant would have changed my current or future financial position I would really appreciate it."
