AskMen,fn7hpy0,t3_fzxppo,1586720557.0,"I come across as straight and people usually are surprised when I let them I know I have a husband. I grew up in a masculine home but don’t spend any time trying to not come across as gay or be masculine.

I’m obsessed with queer eye, love fashion and the arts. My friend are mostly gay - I’m the real deal.

It just goes to show there’s no defined or prescribed definition.

Stop obsessing over it. Just be yourself. You’re cool man."

I’m listening to public health experts, reading epidemiology white papers, and am aware far more than people only listening to the administration or news that this isn’t a two week isolation. Modeling shows it’s measured in months - some scientists say we’re in it until a viable vaccine is mass produced in 12-18 months.

If people aren’t taking it seriously, it’s because the president spent the last month telling people not to take it seriously - so they’re just doing what the president told them.

If fingers are being pointed, there’s one person that has earned responsibility: the commander in chief.

We’re in this together as a community. If you know people that aren’t honoring the CDC guidance, you can help by letting them know that this isn’t a joke.

Also, take a moment to focus on the hope and power of the human spirit. We are an ingenious species. Human brains are going to solve this - the biggest challenge we’ve faced in a generation. We’re resilient. There are no borders in this. All of humanity across the globe is going through the same experiences in concert.

Be educated, but be kind to yourself."
politics,fksiyqe,t3_fkfb8s,1584491155.0,"I thought the scariest part of the paper was when they said that we’re stuck in extreme social distancing until a vaccine is produced for the masses. And that if we ease up on social distancing, it’s likely the virus would come back with an even stronger infection rate. So...we’re going to be in this new normal for a while...a year to 18 months.

I’ve been in therapy since I was 13 so I’m used to sitting in a weird room talking to a stranger. I get it, it’s uncomfortable. But if your partner loves you and is running at the end of their rope, maybe they are open to talking to a mental health professional."
