iPhoneXR,fqofl10,t3_gk1h2e,1589514122.0,"I think your battery has aged well, apple estimates that battery should be around 80% health after 2 years so i am sure yours will be around 85% after 2 years."
AppleMusic,fqo3q0i,t1_fqnollb,1589506946.0,Surprisingly the link is not working for me plus whenever i search for the playlist by name i cant find it. Any ideas why?
iPhoneXR,fqkhiwu,t3_gjap04,1589427428.0,Plus just out of curiosity which all apps do you have on your new Xr? The thing is i like seeing how people organise their IOS home-screens. I personally use folders.
iPhoneXR,fqkheey,t1_fqkg0rb,1589427349.0,"No issues, I honestly use the stock camera app for taking majority of my pictures, but i use snapseed for editing my pictures. I myself wanted to get NeuralCam but wasnt sure if it thats very useful or not, plus its a paid app so was wondering should i spend money on it or not. But trust me the stock camera app is really great, it has some beautiful filters plus it gives you the option to control the exposure and depth field portrait shots so i think that‚Äôs great. Give it a try i am sure you wont be disappointed. üôÉ"
iPhoneXR,fqkcksk,t3_gjap04,1589424505.0,"First of all congratulations for getting this amazing device, i am sure it won‚Äôt disappoint you plus welcome to the XR club! As far as the battery is concerned 95% is great, you will get a screen time of 6 hours on average and that number might just increase with less usage! My iPhone Xr is 3 months old and my battery is at 100% battery and i get about 7-8 hours of screen time on average. Overall this iPhone is great and it will do well for the next 2-3 years."

iPhoneXR,fq8ld9d,t1_fq5nl0e,1589168925.0,Yeah thats very strange to hear because now the new iPhones also don‚Äôt have 3D Touch and all of them have the option for live wallpapers. Me and my friend who own a Xr have used quite a few live wallpapers and never had any issues thankfully. Have you updated your iPhone to the latest software? IOS 13.4.1?
AppleMusic,fq8l48g,t3_gh4tl8,1589168749.0,Why cant they improve the iTunes app for the windows?? It feels so outdated and boring. Plus not to mention how slow and laggy it isüôÑ
ios,fq8kzvu,t3_ghck2t,1589168665.0,"Omg, this is so accurate, some things are just better on IOS but due to some small shortcomings it feels really frustrating! I was just thinking about this keyboard feature last week and was hoping the make these small changes in IOS 14 coming out in June this year. I would really like the new incoming call screen and these small keyboard changes for the IOS update. 

I would also like iPad OS to get the weather and calculator app for god sake. Can you believe it we dont have a stock weather and calculator app for the iPad. Like why? Hopefully these small changes will be implemented soon!"

Most prolly I will get my battery replaced next year when it dips to 80% battery health.
iPhoneX,fbzeenb,t1_fbzd0de,1577243938.0,See the iPhone XR was released a year after the iPhone X so it will be last one more year not that iPhone X is not good. iPhone X still has great performance and will definitely get software updates for next 2-3 years from now whereas on the other hand iPhone XR will get 3-4 years of software update now. So it‚Äôs really up to you which would you preferred. Each of them have their pros and cons
iPhoneX,fbzchg0,t3_ef9we7,1577242121.0,"X has a better camera and a better screen!

oneplus,fa96am4,t3_e80p14,1575863553.0,"I do agree they are one of the best phone manufacturers out there in terms of hardware and even the cost. They are basically providing people with flagship phones at cheaper prices compared to Samsung and Apple. I think they have excellent hardware and the software oxygen OS also has some great features I love but I still think there are a few features and things that they can improve in the software, so I believe they should continue on working a bit harder on their software. As we all know that nothing/no one can be perfect but they can be close to being perfect so I think Oneplus is doing great and they can get closer to perfection in the future."
