Are you craaazy?! Everyone knows that race is the most important factor in every violent crime involving two people of different races!! Why are you not more outraged about this clear oppression of us whites?? (Big /s btw)

Fr tho, people need to chill with their reversed-race speculation about this kind of shit. If anyone immediately spouts this, as many people in this thread are already, nearly identically I might add, they clearly don't care about the loss of human life, and instead instantly try to flip it around merely in the hope of pushing their agenda.

They've proven time and time again they care far more about milking as much money from their overpriced microtransactions than about making their actual *game* feel fun and rewarding to play. I get that they're a company like any other so in the end they're in it to make money, but seriously-- **focus more on the gameplay and less on the damn skins.** Think games never start to die after the company making them only cares about the money? Just look at WoW, or even just Warcraft 3 Reforged. People have a breaking point. Anyway, rant over lol"

leagueoflegends,fr0c93c,t1_fqzm935,1589790545.0,"Yea exactly. Didn't feel too bad back in the day, and it typically felt fine performance-wise on console. I'm just really disappointed they didn't make it a priority to update that side of it, cause that game had potential. If they had, at the very least, fixed the issue with controller support on pc, I very well might still be playing it as one of my main games."
leagueoflegends,fqzk8y5,t1_fqyoj5s,1589769158.0,"I also think it sucks, but as someone who has played a ton of Smite in the past, I have to disagree with you on that one. I love that game, but sadly I refuse to play it ever again until they(possibly) do a major overhaul to their game. It feels extremely outdated in general, it performs quite horribly, and also lacks many possible-to-implement, no-brainer options-- just as LoL does, except worse. I first got into Smite on Xbox, so the fact that it's not only really difficult to even use a controller on pc Smite, I've found it to be practically impossible, which of course makes no sense seeing as they managed to successfully port it to consoles years ago."
summonerschool,fqv5bax,t1_fquy3y7,1589670165.0,"Yea thats pretty typical for Nasus, tho a bit strange that he didn't swap his summs all game. Not a bad idea with the bork. Since he went ghost, I assume he was pretty aggro? Either way, the decider in that lane was most likely the time up to and around him getting sheen, cause that not only gives him a big spike of damage to his AA, but also more mana sustain, allowing him to trade better in lane as well as stay longer and stack more before having to back again. Since I havent played that matchup very recently, I'm not sure what the best course of action would be then as far as what item to build first when building into bork. I'd just assume then that having flash ignite against him and going for early trades, possibly into a couple plates as well, might be the best thing to do."
summonerschool,fquwjrl,t3_gkz0h3,1589665628.0,"Got any more details from that match? Runes, first items, summoners, etc. If Nasus picks into me and I feel like he has a big advantage just from champ select, I almost always take ignite to ensure that I'll have the necessary kill pressure at least in early to mid game. Been awhile since I've played much Jax, but if I recall correctly, the biggest things with him, especially when laning against someone like Nasus, is in timing your E correctly in order to get the better end of trades, as well as being very mindful of your positioning in lane. Imo, Jax's E is by far the most useful part about him, and in the Nasus matchup, this is absolutely true as you'll need to make sure you're blocking his empowered AA, as well as getting your stun off if possible. No matter who Jax is up against, any smart opponent of his will be trying to bait out his E in order to ensure they get a successful trade at the very least, so you have to stay mindful of that. Other than that, as I said positioning seems to be extremely important for strong Jax's since he's able to jump to things such as wards, thus allowing either an escape or sometimes an engage. Admittedly, I used to think Jax was very faceroll as a champ, but the more Jax's I've seen crush lanes and sometimes whole matches singlehandedly, I've realized that to be actually good with him you really have to have good macro. Anyway, Nasus can be tough to lane against for most champs, but as long as you're being mindful of the different small advantages you may be able to exploit, you can definitely beat him, at least in your lane. Other small things to consider against Nasus would again me things such as what runes he has, what starter item he went, and how much he's trying to poke you early on. Nasus can be pretty mana hungry early on, so a big thing to consider when keeping in mind what I just said, is how much sustain he has early game based on those factors, primarily with his mana. Also remember that Nasus wants to scale, so depending on the elo, they may take heavy damage just to get 1-2 empowered AA kills on minions. Play around his mistakes, but always keep an eye on his farming."

dankmemes,fpfdns6,t1_fpf5sv1,1588568218.0,"As someone who grew up in the church, and has been surrounded by Christians for most of my life, I can tell you this is not really accurate. Though I also can't speak to the actual majority, I'd argue that most adamantly hold and defend the viewpoint that the Big Bang didn't happen, and that the story of Adam and Eve took place at least in some similar fashion. I believe this is largely dependent on education. I had to go to a Christian university, and although I only went there for about a year and a half, I will say that in most cases: it would seem that actual professors, or those of similar experience and education, are not only open to free discussion and theorizing over these sorts of core biblical/historical events, but they tend to encourage it actually, and may even agree with certain seemingly ""non-Christian-like"" views that are presented. This is not the case with many of the preachers or other Christian speakers/elders that I've heard and/or spoken to outside of that sort of classroom setting. A lot of them seem like they have indeed *read* the bible at least once to completion, but they don't actually seem to comprehend or question the meaning of the information that's presented in it. I've despised a lot of the teachers I've had all through school in my life, but the professors I mentioned have actually been some of my favorite teachers ever. They actually care and want to talk with you and give you advice and/or merely engage in friendly intellectual debates with you, typically while still respecting your opinions and without actually trying to convince you of anything. Of course, not all of these religious professors are like this. But even tho I don't really consider myself Christian anymore, meeting these people honestly renewed a small bit of hope in my mind that not all Christians are just closeminded, hypocritical bigots.
