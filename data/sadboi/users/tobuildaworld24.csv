You don't have to have experienced love to know what you would expect from it. But that may be a bad question. 

I'll try a few more: 

1. What song do you think about most now?

depression,flckgo8,t3_fo0r8e,1585034436.0,"Take a breath. Take a few more breaths. 

Start with what you can. List out tasks, at work, that you can do. Do those.

List out tasks at home. Do those. 

List out all the things you should be doing. Do those.

List out what you could be doing. Do those.

If you run out of 'things to do', give yourself space to just be. And think about what you want to do. 

Then do those things. 

And think, sometime, or all the time, what the soundtrack of your life would be, and try to do all the things to the tempo of those songs. Just because."
depression,flck2c9,t1_flcj2rd,1585033964.0,"One of my favorite books is actually about the Spanish Influenza. It's called Pale Horse, Pale Rider. It's not an easy read, though it is quick. It's a woman who lives her life, gets the flu, and survives, while those around her die. The entire book is mostly her fever dreams. 

I've always liked it because it made so poignantly clear the difference between dream and reality, even when the line seems blurred. But I liked it, too, because it doesn't paint a happy glow at the end.

It feels like a cruel joke. Life, and that book. And it's hard to say it's not. But it isn't. And what it means is ultimately up to you. If you would like advice on what I think it means, or books I think you should read, I would be more than happy to share. 

If you want to just tell me what's wrong with it right now, please do. I urge you to list it out. I think it will help. 

Like, why is life fucking you? What was going good? What changed? Why are you just watching? What do you think you can do differently? If nothing, why not?"

If I can walk you through it a bit, can I? I think what helped for me was realizing what I thought goodness was. I can sum that up with songs. One I've referenced recently was Scattered Black and Whites by Elbow. It's an English song. Do you have one in Dutch? 

Once you've got that, ask yourself what doesn't match. Ask yourself what needs to change. And ask yourself if you can make those changes. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts."

But here's a different question: what do you think 30 should look like? What do you wish you were doing now that you're not? 

I'm not saying that to make it worse; I'm saying it because at 29, I also felt out of sorts and awful and like I was missing something. I realized I wanted to live inside the song Scattered Blacks and Whites by Elbow, and I realized I was doing it all wrong. 

What song would you live inside? What does it take to get there?"

What are the depressed feelings you need addressed? Again, not a medical professional, but maybe writing the out will give some clarity. 

Also, you don't just have to talk to a gp or psychologist, though I understand what you mean (I think). My common thread is ""Why do I have to pay someone to care?!"" I struggle with it a lot. But you don't have to only go there. You're looking here for support, and that's good! I only wish I spoke your language so I could really hear what you're saying. :("

I've been in emotional places with my husband where a stranger would have said the same thing, so I'm not saying give up. I am saying reevaluate. Reevaluate how you're expressing what you need. Im a person who gets pushed and explodes, so the health of my marriage has depended upon knowing limits, and it has depended on lots and lots and lots of me and him apologizing. 

I'm not saying you're the cause of anything -- but if you need a moment to collect before talking to him, give yourself that. ESPECIALLY when you just dealt an almost crippling health blow yourself. If you say that lovingly, and he doesn't accept it, that's a whole different ball game. 

And also, because it needs to be said -- fuck cancer. Ad fuck cancer scares. Fuck cancer scares real hard. 

And apologies if you don't like strong language. Fluff that fluffing snowball to all hoof and back."

depression,flcgzkl,t3_fnzz3a,1585030503.0,"1. Give yourself some space to breathe. You're doing that physically, but give it to yourself mentally as well. You are in such an unprecedented, unreal position. Before even thinking of your relationship, give yourself 3 minutes, 5 minutes, to just let that be.

2. Breathe. Deeply. The kind of breathing they instruct you to do in mindfulness videos. Just focus on that sensation. 

3. Deal with the relationship. Let those thoughts in. Think about them in terms of what's happening. Really think about the thoughts you're having -- how do you feel about the present situation, all things, together?

4. More deep breaths. More calming exercises. 

5. Try to synthesize. 

6. Repeat. 

There isn't a good answer for anything right now, and my friend, you're in my thoughts. All you can do right now, and the most you can do right now, is be where you need to be, and I don't mean that physically. If you need to emotionally be with your family, be there. If you can't be there for your relationship, either it will work or it won't. Telling your partner exactly how you're feeling and what you're dealing with will almost certainly help, though. 

Have you had that conversation yet?"

My insurance company keeps switching my birth control. I was on a generic for a long time then they switched to the brand.

You have the very real problem of worrying about your ex, and then you have nightmares. I am not a mental health professional in any way, but I have lots of nightmares. So I'll talk about that.

My nightmares tend to be realistic, like yours right now. They're always about people I know, and they're always about them being hurt. 

Dreams tend (TEND) to be about something we are thinking about before bed. Dreams are actually something we don't have a full understanding of. But, whatever. I have found that thinking about my nightmares before I go to sleep, and consciously making them better, means I have less shitty nightmares. They still happen, but I can handle them.

It's fucking AWFUL to dream about an ex. I've been married for years and still dream about my old relationships. Who the fuck knows why it happens? It's harder when it's close, and near, and soon. Realize it's just your mind. Breathe through the feelings afterward. And talk to someone about it! A friend or the internet!"

depression,faquugu,t3_eaga34,1576308467.0,"I don't want to tell you what you need to do.

But I found it was really helpful for me to look for a specific type of therapist while I was dealing with addiction. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has been the best thing for me, touch ACT, Acceptance Commitment Therapy, is also helpful. My ACT therapist was a former addict. He was fantastic. He helped me with through so much stuff. I would recommend ACT higher is I'd been with him longer.

You have to know who you're going to. And sometimes, that isn't a possibility, because of insurance. Just make sure whatever therapist you're with knows what kind of therapy you want, and it sounds so nuts to know what kind of therapy you want, but I think you should look into it and see what fits you."

What is the happy ending to your story?

It sounds like such a stupid question, but it's so big. What is the story you want? Where good those conversations with friends go in your mind? What life do you live apart from this? Who do you think yourself to be? 

Depression is so much a grieving process for the lives we wished we lived. It is a grieving process for the people we wish we were. And it's a grieving process for how we wish other people were. 

If we could understand those things: who we are, who we want to be, and how we want to interact with others, and we could understand how to get there, I think we would be happier. 

So who are you? Who do you want to be? Who are the people that support you?"
