No one has the right to judge you, this is a disease and you’re not responsible for it."
depression,foq1v7q,t3_g8wt2m,1587979937.0,"Don’t worry about what you’re parents think, you were very brave to go and get a diagnosis. Sadly people have still hard times recognising mental issues, it’s something new and scary that can’t be seen from the outside. But This could be a good occasion to ask them to get you to see a therapist, you’ll get help and they will have their confirmation, use this situation to your advantage to start your journey towards recovery. Hope you’ll get to feel better."
depression,foq1cqy,t3_g8wzmr,1587979402.0,"I enjoy doing art, when I was little I dreamed of being an artist, little by little depression sucked from me my passion fed me this idea of being worthless, constantly comparing myself to other people.
I started doubting my work , the effort I spent on it, seemed useless as there was so many more talented artists before me. So I stopped exercising and I left my talent decaying year after year.
Only now after so much time has passed I understand what a stupid thought that was, I work on what I like because I like it, doesn’t matter if it’s still not as good as the best out there, I don’t want to compare to others, I just want to see if I made progress, if the present me is better than the old me, if not I’ll work harder, that’s it."
depression,foq0vo9,t3_g8x2hb,1587978908.0,"Yeah stopping you from enjoying life is a classic depression trait. During my life I felt scared to do anything involving the possibility to fail, my brain told me continuously that I would fail anyway so I shouldn’t have tried to do anything. 

Little by little it stopped me from doing all those things that I liked, studying, being social, work on my hobbies and talents, even enjoying time with family.
After a while I couldn’t even numb my pain with games and fiction like I did before. That’s when I had to act. I’m trying to get back my life, it’s hard and most of the times I still feel horrible, but I see small progress here and there.

I know you said you tried, but I say this, therapy takes times, two sessions won’t be enough to have a visible effect. I hope you’ll rethink your decision and try again."

Anyway the important thing is you don’t give up on yourself, don’t let people put you down, if you want to start change your routine begin with little things, do some exercises every day, clean something like your desk or your wardrobe, and give yourself an hour a day to only work on your assignments, you can obviously do more but try and force yourself to do at least that hour. Maybe this can be of help."
depression,fon7jyf,t3_g8fpv9,1587913947.0,"These are some of the worst time to be depressed, blocked at home and cut from life. I’m trying to better my condition by doing small things everyday, keeping a routine that helps me maintain my mind sane, I do my exercise and clean regularly, I try to work everyday on my art doing something even if I feel like not wanting to, just to be satisfied at the end of the day. If you feel like freeloading at your SO home, you could do some housework and for what it concerns your studies try doing something each day, set a reachable goal, doesn’t have to be much, each day. Last thing I don’t know if you already did it but talk about your feelings, don’t keep everything down it can only get you worse, maybe there’s some kind of online support or therapy you can have access to.

I did it before so diverting my mind from the worries it creates help making me calmer and let’s say normal. Also talking with other people about my problems and feelings gave me a way to analyse them so maybe you could open yourself with someone about that too. Hope you’ll overcome this bad period."
depression,fon1cks,t3_g8dlcb,1587909892.0,"Have you tried professional help, seeing a therapist can help understanding better what’s going on with us and give us a way to vent frustrations and anxieties.

Hope you’ll find some comfort."
depression,fon0tt6,t3_g8dzjn,1587909515.0,"Let’s start saying that exercise won’t cure depression sadly. It can help giving you a sudden boost of energy that can go on for a little while after you finished, but more importantly at least for what it concerns me, it gives a routine to follow, visible progress, it can interrupt a series of bad thoughts, and it’s an easy thing to do, so I can do it anytime with little to no preparation that could stop me from starting an activity in other situations. Other similar activity are cleaning, cooking and self care. I hope the meds will work and  you’ll get out of this bad period."

I’m getting better, and now I can do more than what I did a couple of months ago. I’m planning to go to a therapist as soon as I can, I think that the state of my mind is one of the factors impeding my progress. Also a good sleep routine can help, not everyone is the same obviously but usually being rested can improve your overall activity.

When I decided to try and get better, to feel better, I set myself to search for people with my same interests, I tried to get into new things, I did some volunteering around my neighbourhood, it wasn’t always a smooth ride, and sometimes I questioned my decision, in the end though it really helped me, I met new people and made new friends, this is my experience I hope it can be of some help."

depression,fo3q4qs,t3_g5ifnh,1587491117.0,"Hey, I find your post interesting. I’m not into mysticism or religion, but one thing I did when I felt depressed was trying to escape reality, in any way I could be it comics, video games, movies, books, whatever, I needed something reassuring to keep me going and that provided me whit it. It’s good as it can keep away bad thoughts and give you a boost of confidence and joy. But I find also to be dangerous to keep doing this for too long, at least for me it became like a drug I needed more and more until it didn’t work anymore, and it left me devastated. I say we all need something to distract ourselves from our misery, but remember to not get trapped by it, try to remain social, keep contact with real life. If you need to vent so it with someone close to you and when you feel like you need help ask for it, do not rely only on one thing to keep you safe."

If you feel that way why don’t you try working on one thing at time, any progress might recuperate a bit of confidence and that could help with more things down the line. Also I suggest to see a therapist, opening up to someone about your feelings can help relieving some of the pressure you are under, and it can only be better if you’ll do it together with a professional.

I also play Dnd a role playing game with some friends online (but any game is the same), it involves a lot of background work that keeps my mind occupied. If you have a camera or a good phone you could do a vlog or something similar, talking with your friend afterwards to see what suggestions they can give you. And as you mentioned the beach I suppose you’re an active person, maybe searching for a work out routine that’s more challenging than usual can give you a target to reach before this lockdown ends.

Ask yourself what is that you don’t like about the present and what can change about it, start from there, work on what is still relevant, the past is past forget about it shifting your focus on the present. Hope you can do it, stay safe"

depression,fn5x5gk,t1_fn5wtnv,1586679044.0,"I had that same feeling for a long time, but why care about it, write them and you’ll see that after a while they’ll reciprocate.

depression,fn5vi7e,t3_fzrjly,1586677350.0,"What’s going on? Why do you feel this way? I can say something almost for certain, motivation is a bad companion for doing basic chores, it doesn’t work most of the time. Routine is what you need, when I decided to try and feel a bit better with myself, I started working out every day, forcing my body even if I felt pain. After a while a couple of months I picked up the routine, now I do it regardless of what’s happening with my day. I hope it goes to help you a little too."
