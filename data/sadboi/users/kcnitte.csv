depression,fjot3by,t3_fegd6t,1583534278.0,"Stick around because you’ll never know what the future will bring. Keep strong and just do what you think is best for your life. Religious or not, please have faith because the way I see it, you’re doing the best you can. Not everyone is fortunate enough to successfully go through what you’ve been through. Whatever your past is, it made you a better person, it made you more resilient. You have strength, sometimes you’re just tired. But keep pushing. And sometimes we dwell too much in one aspect of our life we miss out the other part that is beautiful. Yes life is hard but those struggles will help you grow. We all need help and there is help out here, out there in the real world."
depression,fit1ir4,t3_f9ita6,1582700551.0,"Please do not end your life. Reach out to your most trusted person. I know not everyone is religious but pray for guidance, strength, and enlightenment."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fbn3ln9,t3_edyslm,1576992279.0,For 2020 and beyond!!!!
FemaleDatingStrategy,fbe9ktp,t1_fbdoshc,1576781271.0,Gotta learn this.
depression,fa94r7w,t3_e7vxms,1575862400.0,"I’d given up the dream of having a child since I am still trying to help myself deal with my depression and anxiety.  I can’t be a wife, a mom with this condition. To top it off, it’s not easy finding a man who can understand these sort of stuff."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fa93bt5,t3_e7wxiy,1575861339.0,Where is this HVM ? Where is this human 😆
FemaleDatingStrategy,f9odjow,t1_f9od783,1575502002.0,"Yeah I need to get my life together in all aspects. Working on the career I want to pursue, taking care of myself (physically, emotionally, mentally.. all of it lol), taking care of family members that need support, .. I’m  behind my social life tho.. i just need to gather some courage to start doing things.."
FemaleDatingStrategy,f9o8wbv,t1_f9nhrtb,1575498981.0,I’m also trying to to this. It’s hard to be alone but harder to settle just for the sake of settling
FemaleDatingStrategy,f80vykr,t3_dy62pt,1574139979.0,Ouch. Haha truth hurts.
FemaleDatingStrategy,f7csbbe,t3_dv9kd4,1573598910.0,Been there. It makes no sense and what a waste of my time. I expect myself to cut ties ASAP if it happens to me again. Help me remind myself 😀
FemaleDatingStrategy,f7ay6u1,t3_dv0siq,1573545526.0,Thank you. I needed these reminders as I cannot find a good support system for stuff like this. 🥰
depression,f76a4uf,t3_duda1u,1573425631.0,Happy birthday to you!!! 🙂
FemaleDatingStrategy,f5oq7z4,t3_dohtdq,1572326753.0,"Who are these men? They need to be educated, they need to change. Please don’t tell me they have wives, kids, family. Are these the low lifers? The lowest of all? How cruel, inappropriate, and disgusting. 

How do you even start making them understand that to be a good human starts with loving themselves first... they’re the ones who need self-love. All they have is actually self-hate."
FemaleDatingStrategy,f4kbed7,t1_f4i66mn,1571643997.0,Sadly I haven’t experienced it so I only base on other people’s experience. It’s hard not to feel hopeless that someday you’ll really meet someone worthy. Makes you wonder how much work do you  need to do to yourself in order to be the better version of yourself and eventually attract the right person.
ForeverAloneDating,f45uisf,t3_dji9ym,1571396030.0,"She’s out there. And you will find her. ❤️

It’s refreshing to know that there are still people who believes and feels this way. Makes me feel a bit hopeful."
FemaleDatingStrategy,f3w64dh,t1_f3vzj79,1571192938.0,Yeah. So can relate 😆

depression,f1c18c9,t3_d8l62g,1569347604.0,"It’s not your fault and it’ll never be your fault. You are stronger than you think. I truly hope you can find someone very close to you for you to confide in. And yes, therapy helps. Reddit helps as well, see there are people here who understands without judgement. This is the time for you to challenge your thoughts and emotions. I know it’s hard to fathom why bad things happen to us and why people take advantage- but you are greater than your pain. Your suffering doesn’t define who you are. Please take a moment to pause and breathe... there is hope. Gather your strength and energy to be as brave as you can be and the reach out for help."

depression,ewlis9l,t3_coqztd,1565525986.0,Sending you a virtual hug as well.
depression,ewekv2k,t1_ewe2588,1565327350.0,"This is a very good advice. I gotta remind myself: action then motivation, doing something then confidence. 

Thank you!!!"
depression,ewekn1w,t1_ewed58c,1565327141.0,"How can you find someone if you’re in a depressed state... How much as I want to have someone right now, I’ll feel sorry for him because he’s gonna be dealing with my demons too."
depression,ewekel4,t1_ewdqwkg,1565326912.0,I want one lol
depression,ewbuqtl,t3_cnf0qn,1565272635.0,I started using Moodpath and it’ll always ask me about my emotions. I alway put ‘tired’ because really I’ve been depressed since I was a teenager and it’s so tiring being tired
depression,ewatub2,t3_cn5vlj,1565251739.0,"Does anyone know how to wake up feeling better? Or maybe firstly I should ask, how to find the energy to do stuff?"
depression,evsbibe,t1_evrcgj9,1564739256.0,Know this by heart. Now I just need to know it by brain.
depression,evrupo9,t1_evqhoib,1564719099.0,Thanks! Sometimes I’m able to laugh it off. I’m officially a crazy person with mental illness lol
depression,evov8tv,t3_ck913s,1564658963.0,"I signed up to reddit to find people like me and hopefully make me feel less alone, hopefully provide insights on why are we this way, hopefully lend a helping hand (advise - although I might not be wise enough but I can try and also listen). I have been crying on and off and I’m so tired and I gotta remind myself that maybe things will be better, and just keep fighting. We must try to be better ... Many thanks, reddit people. You’re helping one way or another."
sydney,evohov0,t1_evemc95,1564646919.0,"Yup I agree, while inside the train. I’ve mastered the art of letting my tears fall and pretending something just caught my eye. It’s a talent, really."
