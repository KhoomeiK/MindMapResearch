my mom is in surgery now and i’ll make it back to my home town around the time she’s gonna get out. she’ll stay in the hospital over night and then i’ll get to take her home tomorrow!

I’m aware that she has other friends she cares more about, but she knew the date of the concert and decided to plan something the same day after I bought her the tickets.

Also, with the whole shroom thing, she was supposed to be my trip sitter and she left me to go hang out with a boy. She was trip sitting me because I don’t do well when I trip alone and she knew that. I was at my place so it wasn’t that big of a deal, but when you’re alone with your thoughts on shrooms, that’s when things can get dangerous."
