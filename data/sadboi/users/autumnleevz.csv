After every person checks out or opens a door, I’m right on it. We’ve been letting the EPA sit on surfaces instead of wiping it away immediately, as well as soaking implements just like always. We switched to plastic cups for beverages for the time being. 

We have high risk clients who still come in, and it makes me really anxious. I love our clients, but I don’t want irresponsibility on our end to be the reason they get sick, as well as any other client that walks through our door."
hairstylist,fkjctye,t1_fkeaq1z,1584242292.0,"THIS. We had a client come from Florida who said her former stylist never rinsed her hair after the initial application, and sent her on her way after she blew her hair out and straightened it. I don’t understand how this was ever a thing stylists did and still do. Idc if it saves time, fuck that. Protect your clients or lose your license."

hairstylist,fcma138,t1_fclzjvr,1577768319.0,I personally do and I use it myself at home. There’s no such thing as a miracle product when it comes to damaged hair though. If you badly need stitches a bandaid and some superglue won’t help you forever!

hairstylist,fcle67i,t3_ehsuea,1577745723.0,"I would just explain to her that she needs to use better products and use treatments for her hair if she wants those lowlights to hold, because it’s so porous. if you find a porosity equalizer that works keep me updated!!! 

Redken shades EQ cream is an equalizing Demi-permanent. Idk if you’re at a salon that can offer that or if you can carry your own color line, but it’s pretty cool. It’s gonna slip out of her hair really easy without sulfate free shampoo/conditioner though. You can only do so much with the canvas you’re given and how much said canvas is willing to take care of it 😂"

hairstylist,fclcdop,t3_ehsuea,1577744563.0,She should use olaplex no. 3 at home and do olaplex treatments in the salon if you offer them to help even out her hair’s porosity... I don’t use matrix so I’m not sure what to recommend in their color lines and I’m not sure if you use any other brands. Maybe mix the 7G with a neutral 6/6N? I’d be scared to go any darker or use a 6G if her hair is hella porous

Hair,f8um9k3,t3_e2avf8,1574834345.0,"It’s hard to see the True Tone because of lighting, but to me it looks like you’re a natural blonde... if you’ve already colored you hair maybe that’s just your new growth. 

If that’s not the case, a tooooon of people are pre-disposed to grays at super early ages. I used to ask my clients when they started to see gray hairs to gauge this. I’ve had several tell me that it started in their late teens/early twenties.

Keep in mind also that hair color can change during hormonal changes as well. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s gray, but people go from brunette-blonde and vice versa through age. 

Don’t sweat it! It looks blonde to me. But even if it isn’t, SO many people are pining after silver hair right now, and it’s been a trend for quite a few years. And they’ve payed hundreds of dollars to get there. Rock that natural color doll."
Hair,f81yowx,t3_dybj7j,1574180255.0,"So just to start, all heat can and will damage your hair eventually. The way to treat this is getting trims regular, using a lower heat setting, and as you said, heat protectants. Not everyone needs a super high heat setting on their flat iron. I notice that a lot of people bump it all the way up to 450°F (sorry I don’t know the metric system), when most people can get away with 350°, and some can get away with even less. There are a ton of heat protectants on the market. The one I use for thermal styling on dry hair is Redken Hot Sets 22. It offers great heat protection and has some hold to it, so I find it helps keep the hair in place. Another great one is Redken frizz dismiss rebel tame leave in cream, you use that on damp hair. 
Redken is what I use at work though, so I might be biased, but I swear they are great products!

Hope this helps!"
Hair,f81w989,t3_dykbb5,1574178731.0,"Hi! I have extremely fine hair so it gets really oily really fast, but the longer I go in between washes, the dryer my ends feel. 
I transitioned out of washing my hair by slowly going every other day, then every three days. The things that have made the biggest difference for me are salon quality shampoo and conditioner, and of course, dry shampoo.
With dry shampoo I actually use it on clean hair every single time, and then add some more as the days go by. By using it on clean hair it doesn’t feel/look so cakey come day 2 and 3, because it absorbs the oils more evenly. 
Also keeping conditioner off of your scalp helps!
Hope this helps :)"
Hair,f81vmfv,t3_dykjc4,1574178337.0,"There’s most likely no way to fix this at home without your hair breaking off unless you want to keep layering it with dyes, and that will also mean keeping your hair dark. 
Over the counter hair color removers are extremely risky and compromising to the hair...
Just go to a salon for a consultation! Just to see!!! They can go over every option with you while actually being able to see you hair. It will save you the money and the heartbreak in the long run!"
Hair,f81uz0w,t3_dykrdg,1574177932.0,"Like u/ghostwoofer said, henna is extremely risky to color your hair with. Sometimes if you put lightener/color on top of it, it has the potential to turn your hair green, melt it, start smoking (not bullshitting) and a whole other slew of things. Even if it fades and you aren’t able to see it any more, it is still in your hair, and won’t come out until you completely grow it out and cut it, and that will take years. 

Just be careful!

Edit: I recommend going to a salon for a gloss! They’re demi permanent and are great for subtly enhancing your hair :)"
Hair,f809s3q,t1_f800ryi,1574123794.0,You could also try going to a salon and have them take some weight off of it while keeping the length. It sounds like you must have super long or thick hair. If they add some layers or just do some debulking it might help as well
Hair,f7zjhca,t3_dy5p9l,1574111613.0,"If it doesn’t turn out and you won’t lose your mind that’s cool, just keep in mind that color corrections are really expensive, and you already have black box dye on your hair. That will stay in your hair until it grows out... even if you manage to get it light enough where you don’t see it. It will still be there.
Be careful with color oops for sure. And please please PLEASE don’t use 40 volume. 

Best of luck friend"
Hair,f7ziium,t3_dy5r9i,1574111209.0,"Hey! I use dry shampoo every day. I wash my hair 2/3 times a week. The best tip I have ever gotten was from my coworker, who suggests to her clients that they use dry shampoo on day one hair. Just spray it, distribute it and go. It’s a lot less cakey come days 2 and three. 

I know it’s not helpful for relying less on dry shampoo, but it’s still an awesome tip. Also try maybe washing twice a week instead of once a week. Not everyone’s hair is the same, and sometimes only washing once a week isn’t ideal for certain hair types. You hair can become more oily than it was before due to environmental factors, changes in diet and other changes in lifestyle and age."

Also consider getting olaplex treatments and investing in olaplex no. 3 to use once a week. Keep that blonde from breaking!"

AskReddit,f7k89h3,t1_f7k7osu,1573798012.0,"I don’t know if you’ve been a server before. But to be fair, it’s not a cushy office job. Restaurants are rough. It’s not as rough as manual labor by far, but the average annual income for servers is $20k, and I’ve worked as a receptionist before where I got paid more to sit on my ass and answer phones. “The added benefit of societal guilt” is because of the whole way that system is set up. It’s not that we think we’re special, we’re just trying to pay our bills the same as anyone else.
I saw a comment where someone mentioned they’d rather make a percentage of their sales. I think that would be way better."
AskReddit,f7k6p31,t1_f7k5e7m,1573796407.0,"That’s a fair point.

I’m sure Panera employees work very hard, and they also deserve living wages. 

But normally your server does a lot more than just take your order.... they get your drinks, prep your food, sometimes make certain food items. They bring you 139,928.472 refills. They grab you extra sauce. They work as hard as they can to fulfill you every request. Oh you need more napkins? Let me get that for you. Oh you want me to bring you ice on the side? Let me get that for you. Oh you’re a table of 15 people who all need 10 things every time I come up with the last person’s 10 things? Let me get that for you. All while having 6 other tables who all also need a million things. 

It can be a hard job. And I never minded when a customer needed 18 refills, because that was my job. 
But if a table didn’t tip it would really irritate me depending on how demanding they were or if they were rude or not. Because honestly I worked my ass off until my feet bled some nights. 

I have all the respect for the kitchen staff who worked just as hard as I did and went home sore and tired as well. They should get their coin too. 

I guess if you don’t want to tip that’s your prerogative. It doesn’t make a difference to me anymore, I don’t wait tables now. But at least don’t be one of the rude customers when you’re doing it, because that always fucking sucked."
AskReddit,f7k4aql,t1_f7jjno2,1573794268.0,"But would you agree that making $7.25 is a decent living wage for anyone, working at McDonald’s or not? I understand where you’re coming from on this, but most servers are only able to work part time (employers in Texas try to keep labor costs down that way, at least). Sure, the restaurant won’t have to pay them, but if you’re say, a single mom, $7.25/hr isn’t shit. Not if that’s your only job at least."
AskReddit,f7k3uuv,t1_f7hmrjt,1573793900.0,"I agree, it’s stupid. But it’s the truth. The biggest paycheck I received from an actual company vs. tips was no more than $12.31. (Besides training pay, which is minimum wage)
Many restaurants used to pay hourly wages and then tipping was optional or 10% or whatever. When the recession hit a lot of states made it legal to where servers are only paid $2.13/hr (and then it’s all taken out in taxes). Even though we’re past the recession and IHOP/Olive Garden/etc. can certainly fucking afford to pay their workers decent wages, they just won’t because they’re a corporation. It creates this toxic culture where people can be utterly disgusting towards their server, knowing full well they can treat them badly because of this system. I was a waitress for 3 years, and some days I could walk out with hundreds of dollars for a 6 hour shift, and some days I could walk out only making $12."
