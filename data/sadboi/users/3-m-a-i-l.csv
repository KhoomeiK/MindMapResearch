bipolar,fqr52tw,t1_fqpur52,1589577740.0,It's been a few months (maybe 3 now?) but I've been on a suuuper low dose and I feel like they just kicked in in the last few weeks. I've been on abilify and lamictal before and they had too many side effects for me and vraylar is the first thing to make me feel like it really is doing anything. What do I do to feel better? I already do yoga and meditation and it still kinda feels like BS

relationship_advice,fqih2er,t1_fqi761n,1589395904.0,"In that case what I think is best for your own self worth and self esteem (as someone who has spent years rehabilitating my relationship with my family) is to take some time for yourself. It doesn't hurt to let them know they /can/ lose you. Don't treat it as giving up on them or leaving them forever, but take it as a break and as some time to find some stable footing in your own identity before going back as a stronger person to fix this broken thing. Sometimes we need some time alone to build our resources and that is perfectly perfectly okay!"
relationship_advice,fqi6q4r,t3_gj3g0c,1589391325.0,I SERIOUSLY recommend a therapist to cope with the psychological warfare your family has pitted against you. This is not something that can be solved on your own or by strangers on the internet. I think family counseling (especially starting off individually by yourself and explaining this situation) is the best route for you to own and work through your own feelings while still keeping the relationship because otherwise I don't see a reality where you are your own person and still with them. You either lose yourself or them or you get professional help.

bipolar,fn8ljso,t3_fzy1fq,1586744415.0,How long did it take to kick in?
bipolar,fn8kdxa,t3_g090vy,1586743642.0,I have a very similar story. I was bullied to the point of physical abuse. I remember not just things like being tripped and people throwing things at me but being bashed into a desk and such. For a long time I blamed my dad for not getting me the help I needed especially since I have PTSD from my mom's death. I still feel bad all the time because I never had the resources I needed and still don't (especially in this quarantine) but now it's my job to get them for myself because who else is going to take care of me? Clearly not my family .

Public shaming is one of the most effective ways to get someone to realize their behavior isn't normal. This might reduce the behavior or force him to hide it but even if the latter happens she'll know you sympathize and that someone has her back

BoJackHorseman,fg8cd3d,t1_fg81hgd,1580615390.0,"But it's not okay. He went to jail. The fact that he doesn't get to die and he still has to live with himself is his punishment. If he just died that's taking the easy way out. Additionally, it reminds the people that relate to him (even if they're not quite as horrible) that sometimes life is shit....and then you keep living which I think is a better message than you can't ever change or improve so you should just die"
