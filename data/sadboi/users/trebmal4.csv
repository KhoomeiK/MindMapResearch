BreakingBenjamin,fm6bz9g,t3_ft3s7u,1585790713.0,This is so good.
CoronavirusUS,fltu30v,t3_fqzyyh,1585487249.0,"My husband is a Direct Support Professional at a group home for mentally/physically disabled adults. One of his direct care patients tested positive today. My husband is a 50 year old diabetic with high blood pressure.
I am 49 years old, have asthma and sarcoidosis. I work at home.

Would it be better for me to self isolate or him to self isolate when he is not at work?

At this point, it is probably too late but we are not sure how to go about who to isolate, me, all the time, or him when he is home."

Edit: Oh, also, I have been paying Highlander Hunter and Mage this season to climb. Just hit 1000 wins on my Hunter in HS."

Assistance,faebmym,t1_fae8rhz,1575997822.0,"Thank you to /u/sarcasticlovely for your generous offer that is no longer needed.

I just heard from my husband. He ended up parking in some public lot that was $1.50 which he had in change in his car. 

I'm embarrassed that I panicked and posted about this. Stupid anxiety."
Assistance,fae8i1x,t1_fae7vn7,1575995964.0,I haven't heard back from him yet. I'm guessing he's still in court. He probably has to pay on his way out I imagine. =/
