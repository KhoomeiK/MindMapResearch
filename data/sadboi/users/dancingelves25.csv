greysanatomy,fr6i16r,t1_fr5b7tj,1589926636.0,It's not just in America though 😂 in Australia where we have a universal healthcare system doctors don't try to resolve it for you either. You HAVE to advocate for yourself and keep showing up for appointments before they bother to run tests. You have to push for things yourself because in my experience a good doctor is incredibly hard to find. And almost everyone I know says the bulk bill (free) doctors are even more like this so ultimately you need to be rich/able to pay for private before you get good care.
depression,fr3vpab,t1_fr3tb9l,1589867595.0,"Once you leave the drama of high school behind, most intelligent people will start to mature and realise the importance of showing compassion and kindness to others. You might just be a couple steps ahead of everyone else but they will get there.

depression,fr3vkdr,t3_gm80dl,1589867484.0,"I think over time it becomes clear who is a real friend and who isn't. In saying that, I've felt able-ism to be an issue in society at large. In that, people, generally want to be friends with people at their highs more than their lows. I think it's a good decision to get off social media and stay clear of people who make no effort to show any compassion towards you, but also don't forget that other people have things going on in their life and it may not have been as noticeable to them that you needed love and support during this time as it was to you. Not that I'm excusing people for being shitty friends, but human beings tend to be a little self absorbed and you might need to point it out if you want something from someone."
confessions,fqvkpcy,t3_gkt053,1589679346.0,"I'm so sorry that you went through this. That anxiety is totally normal given your circumstances and the trauma you went through. I really don't want it to be something that stays with you like it did for me, so please think about seeing your school counselor or another professional. Situational anxiety can be very debilitating and you shouldn't have to feel this way in your home. 

I can relate to what you are going through. I grew up with a lot of violence and alcoholism around me and got debilitating anxiety whenever I stepped foot in my old family home. It can be very confusing to see a nice sober person and a violent and nasty drunk person that lives underneath the surface. After a while it started to impact on other parts of my life (e.g. seeing male teachers raise their voices, seeing people drunk at parties, having mild disagreements with people in confined spaces). What helped was having someone with me when I finally re-entered the family home who I felt safe around. Since this isn't going to be an option for you, you need to be able to express this with someone where your anxiety isn't triggering. Have a professional coach you through how to raise it with your family so that they can help to make you feel safe again. You dont have any obligation to forgive your dad straight away. It can and should take time for him to regain your trust. However, I don't think this anxiety is about forgiveness. Instead it's about that loss of safety where you are supposed to feel the most safe. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk."

ehlersdanlos,fqtr84n,t3_gkntou,1589644531.0,"I have G-HSD and other comorbidities so forgive me if I'm not allowed to comment on this without an EDS diagnosis. But do we think it's the collagen or the impact of chronic pain and other symptoms that start early in life and give us a different experience of childhood? E.g. not appearing like we have health issues due to the invisible nature of it (besides maybe dislocations and flexibility which can be looked upon as favourable) and therefore not receiving adequate care? Or getting dislocations/other health issues and experiencing loss of movement/stopping physical activity. Or not having a community of people around us to help us in these experiences? 

Wouldn't having this pain/insomnia/dsyautonomia (etc) at such a young age affect development and cause complex PTSD, anxiety and/or depression? Thinking back on my own experience of having these symptoms from like 6 years old and then getting inadequate treatment or none at all for 20 years makes me think the link is associated with the stress response changing the amygdala. Anecdotally, and personally it's not just mental health but also memory problems. On top of that pain and a lack of ability to explain it (especially when it can cause brain fog) can lead to relationship breakdown which in turn has a negative affect on mental health. Bit of a viscous cycle really."

I'm not in the same situation as you. I was lucky enough not to be as bad for a while and get myself a full time job when things were a little better and the pain was manageable.

Then my friends will ask me if I've tried meditation 😂 

I can tell you that if I was this way back when I was studying or looking for my first full time role then I would have struggled like you are. 

It's never easy to relay how we feel to others because there is no machine that transfers our pain or exhaustion or the myriad of other symptoms/co-morbidities to others (not that we'd wish it on them) but there are some pretty good videos on YouTube that might help those around you to understand.

Yes, I think I started being aware of my pain more when I was less busy focusing on stressful events. Definetely pushed through and overworked myself as a teenager and young adult to help me forget and push past what was actually going on. 

I know I still unconsciously live in that state of stress that you mentioned cause I'm SO jumpy. Like sometimes my husband will laugh while I'm gaming and if it's sudden even that will make me jump.

raisedbynarcissists,fqhp2vt,t1_fqhd423,1589381535.0,"No I'm not! I got married and live with my husband now ☺️ but I guess I only JUST feel safe because I moved interstate and my mum doesn't know where I live. 

And this is such a long story and it was oddly therapeutic writing it out so here goes...

I got married three years ago and everything was going well, except for the constant stress of my mum trying to ruin my marriage with claims to external family that my husband was physically abusing me (great story NMum projecting much!!). 

Then six months ago, I finally cut her off for good. Here we go, I thought. Peace is coming for me. Around the same time my husband had to move states for work and we started doing long distance. My pain and other symptoms starting coming back after being in remission for a few years. I wasn't sure if it was the relative peace of not having her contact or the different kind of stress of a long distance marriage coupled with facing the grief of losing my parent or facing the fact that I never got to have the nurturing I wanted and needed (you know what I mean).

Then at the beginning of the year while I was flying back and forth between states I got a virus (not corona lol) and had an awful weekend where I had a fight with my husband and he asked for a divorce. Somehow we made up and he said he didn't really want it but it was a horrible fight. The kind of fight you don't shake easily and really it was just that we couldn't handle long distance. I flew back home, sick as a dog and spent the next week absolutely stressed that he would go back to wanting our marriage to be over. A few days later, I got a call from a family member saying my little brother had tried to kill himself. He had been picked up by my mum who tried to check him in at a mental institution. He refused and they got into a fight. She's done this before. Taken over his life by checking him into mental institutions (he's not insane just depressed) and then isolating him and not letting people know where he is. She basically hides him from the world. She did it growing up too. He was a clingy child and she loved it. She never wanted his dependency on her to stop. She wanted to be his whole world. There was alcohol involved and then he apparently pulled out a knife, threatened to slit his wrists and drink bleach. She called the police and they took him to a mental institution (funnily enough she coerced him into being a little psycho and got exactly what she wanted). That's the story I eventually heard from him BUT (now here's the kicker) for about a week I didn't know what had actually happened because my mum was using the story for attention across the family and her narrative was very different. In her version he hadn't threatened to do those things. He HAD done those things. In her version he was also in ICU and she wouldn't let anyone see him or know his condition or where he was. As you'd imagine the stress and worry was IMMENSE. I mean drinking a bottle of bleach and cutting your wrists is enough to kill you so I thought he could actually die. Every family member from across the ocean to timbucktoo was calling me and we were all working together to find out where he was and what his condition was. We even asked a detective to help who my aunt knew personally. She used it as a mad goose chase, getting off on the fear and stress of everyone involved and hoping I would re-instate contact. I had a nervous breakdown at work (my whole body started shaking and I couldn't even speak). I wasn't sleeping at all for like a week.  Instead I called round to hospitals and eventually I FOUND HIM. I couldn't believe it and he was fine!!  His main complaint was that he was bored and had asked the nurses for her to stop coming in. She didn't want to admit that, so she didn't tell anyone where he was. 

...

Since that though, my body won't let up.

I'm not sure exactly how you deal with it but the outcome for me from just sticking to being kind and genuine and helpful with them has eventually led them to believe me. But ultimately the best proof was when I cut her off and as she was cut off from her narcassistic supply she started coming after other family members. Ultimately it was nothing I could do other than consistently stay true to myself and not be like her. Eventually her true colours showed to the other family members.

Are you asking the difference between acute and chronic pain? The difference is that acute pain lasts for 1 day to 3 months and results from damage to bones, ligaments or tissue.  Chronic pain, in contrast, may be considered a disease state. It is pain that continues long after your tissue has healed (usually after 6 months) in the case of an injury or associated with a disease/disorder/syndrome.  

If it has been six months since your fall the pain associated with an injury should have already healed. If it hasn't, then it's chronic and will need to be treated differently.

A doctor can help figure out what is going on with you. 
Wish you luck."

I have had to do an entire mother's day project at work and sit through people saying how nurturing and kind all mothers are, and one colleague saying how much she misses her mother after not seeing her for a few months in quarantine and directly saying she cried building the presentation. Of course I cried straight after our call. Having to smile through that is a trigger."

POTS,fpxd67a,t1_fpw9vdd,1588980355.0,"I live in Australia where our summers get to 104 farenheit
so I wanted to chime in here. I avoid the heat at all costs but on days when I'm doing a bush walk where there are ticks (+all the other Aussie bugs, lol) the most vital things for me to avoid pre-syncope is to wear the right clothing. You need merino wool (sounds weird but it is actually a great summer fabric and wicks moisture) in a summer light-weight style. [here](https://www.smartwool.com/socks/compression-socks.html) is a link to some great merino socks. Get a water bottle with a spray function at the top to wet your face regularly.  Get a cooling bandana to wear around your neck. I just wet my neck but this might not look as professional. Iced water and lots of it. Invest in a yeti bottle (or similar brand) that keeps drinks cool all day long. You are going to want to carry over water with you as much as possible. ."
ChronicPain,fpxaa66,t1_fpwesvu,1588978709.0,Try a tens machine with a massage function. Closest I've felt to a real massage
ChronicPain,fpx925o,t3_gfuinw,1588978024.0,"It sounds like you are going through a pretty difficult period of pain right now. I've been feeling really flat lately as well and totally understand the going to bed to hide from the pain. Learning is so hard when your mind keeps taking you there. I started out with myofascial pain from macro trauma/dislocations and then it turned into fibro. While MFS and fibro are different in many ways, they share the same mechanism of central sensitisation so they can be treated in similar ways. 

You've had pain for a long time so maybe try to figure out what's different about this period for you? E.g. are you feeling more stressed/isolated/unsupported? Try to tackle the emotional aspect first. 

Then, if you can get to a physio or osteo do so, as they will help you learn to use some exercises to find some form of relief during the day. 

I'm also working from home and it's very difficult not to be tempted to sleep during the day. The below is a list of what I do besides medication specifically for my muscular pain:


Every hour I reheat my heat packs and leave them on whatever spots are sorest in those moments. 


I also bought a tens machine which allows me to put it on massage function for 15 mins on one spot every hour. I just rotate it throughout the day. This is the closest massager I've found to human touch as it actually has rub/knead functions that go onto the nerves like a hand would. It also helps with nerve pain if you get any. 

I also use a blue light filter (Google flux) to reduce my eye strain/migraines and just to ease off a little on what can feel intense. 

Keep hydrated. Drink lots of warm tea to re-centre my mind (English breakfast, chamomile, peppermint or lemon and ginger depending on my worst symptoms that day). 

Every 3 hours, take a 2 min, 5 min, 10 min walk whatever you can manage. Some days I can only manage a walk downstairs and back up them. And that's okay. It's something.

In the morning, midday and afternoon put on a meditation track on YouTube, and let yourself rest your eyes and do all over body muscle relaxation by tightening one muscle and then releasing. Do it all over the body from head to toe. I finish by gently massaging 

I take a warm/hot shower everyday at midday. I sit in it to get it on my back. The hot water helps to relieve some of the worst pain. I would live here if I could. 

I use an essential oil diffuser (Lavender, peppermint and tea tree oil is a good mix for calming, helping the airways and sinuses - and copaiba is known to help pain - wanting to try this next). 


Take workload in increments. Use a calendar to set up slots for small tasks. A. Complete one reading then feel free to take a break and think about that reading during your break. B. Write a few words for a project I'm working on. Proof read and edit. It helps when I give myself strict deadlines. Though usually I have to fulfil these because my job is very fast paced. 

Learn to understand triggers. Write them down and avoid what makes you worse if you can. 


Make sure you have the right setup for posture. Just want to avoid anything that could make it worse. 

And last but not least, talk to people who can motivate you. Even if it's just someone on Reddit. It's okay to feel this way multiple times a day. Your body is dealing with a lot and subsequently so is your mind."
TMJ,fpw3xjz,t1_fpuss1n,1588956831.0,"You hit the nail on the head with these suggestions. My jaw was in a really bad place two months ago and I did all of this (except going to a dentist as my issue is due to dislocations/eds not teeth/bite alignment). 

Only other things I'd suggest

Get a mouthguard for sleep (if you can't afford a special made one then a sports one will be okay short term). Wear it at night to reduce strain from clenching. 


Massage the jaw with magnesium oil. Make sure you don't get it anywhere near your eyes. 


Suck on ice at the back of your jaw if it's your teeth. 

For me, a heated wheat bag worked wonders. 


Try gentle exercise (tongue to roof of mouth) morning and night. After a couple of weeks when it's more relaxed try gentle chin tuck and forward movements. 


Drink warm chamomile tea. 


Meditatation or prayer."

melbourne,fprvptq,t1_fpr4ds5,1588862950.0,"Agreed. Unfortunately we need to remember that there are still Australians alive today who prescribe to this way of thinking and unfortunately new ones being raised to think in the same manner. Australia was founded on such a racist document and has continued to have people in parliamentary and media positions to allow these people to keep conforming to this way of thinking. A survey came out last year that showed that it's still really pervasive in schools, with 40% of non-anglo children reporting racism. Hopefully less old bags stuck in the past in years to come."
melbourne,fproozp,t1_fpqxs7u,1588859003.0,"Haha you are right. I work in a data role and I have access to data that maps questions from national surveys like the census.

Don't drink fast but also don't wait too long between drinks as I find it's harder to drink it when really thirsty.  I've also found that fruit flavoured cold teas with ice chips helps too. Increase foods with high water content of you can manage them, like soups."

AskDocs,fpqlv21,t3_gen7jj,1588825882.0,"Hi there. NAD but what you described happens to me multiple times daily. It's called syncope/pre-syncope (mines postural and due to pre-existing conditions). But for you, if it's a one off it could be just situationsl. Possibly due to dehydration or low blood sugar if you hadn't eaten much and had over exerted yourself prior. You could also have electrolyte loss if you are working out a lot and then not consuming much to make up for it (I read that you only ate 700 calories at the time). Especially if you are just drinking a lot of water after workouts but not eating to replace those minerals like sodium. 

I would just go to the doctor to double check your blood pressure and for any congenital heart abnormalities but likely just something related to your activities if this is a one off event for you."
Fibromyalgia,fpqkn0x,t3_gerz9m,1588825032.0,"I think people don't understand that tiredness and fatigue are different. my boss the other day said he was really tired one morning and he explained fatigue without realising it because he was like ""I had a full night's sleep but I woke up not feeling refreshed, it was really weird"".

dysautonomia,fplrnmp,t1_fpkf27a,1588718163.0,"Hey! Yeah my heart rate is really variable and respiratory rate is low as well. I feel I have to do a deep breath every so often to increase my oxygen. 

Yes to all except for fainting. I go into pre-syncope and have only physically fainted twice. Usually its a blackout rather than full on fainting where I collapse from a general weakness but it only lasts about 10 seconds. But I am dizzy with everything, like I can't even move from the couch to the kitchen sometimes without my vision going blurred and my body collapsing from weakness. 

My brother actually had a similar problem but for him he said he couldn't take a full breath at all and ended up having a vascular ring which causes a ring around the trachea. He got a stent put in place. I haven't investigated if this could be the same issue as I have symptoms like yours (that he didn't have)."
dysautonomia,fplqrq4,t1_fplex0v,1588717683.0,Yeah it's really frustrating. According to my rheumatologist this is part of central sensitisation syndrome.
