islam,fnre35v,t3_g3fapy,1587186223.0,"This is by far my favorite when it comes to Prophet Muhammad (Pbuh)'s amazing accomplishments, I'm sure you'll love it: 

 ""Prophet Muhammad‚Äôs anti-racist views are seen in his friendship with Bilal ibn Rabah, a black slave who rose to a leading position within the Muslim community of 7th century Arabia. One story relates how Muhammad defended Bilal after Abu Dharr Al-Ghifari, one of the Prophet‚Äôs companions, called Bilal ‚Äúthe son of a black woman.‚Äù Annoyed with this emphasis of identifying people by skin color, Muhammad criticized Abu Dharr by stating ‚Äúyou are the man who still has the traits of ignorance in him.‚Äù The Prophet‚Äôs reference to Abu Dharr‚Äôs ignorance refers to the ‚Äúpre-Islamic‚Äù state of jahiliyyah, an Arabic term meaning ‚Äúthe state of ignorance of Divine guidance.‚Äù This period of Arab history before Muhammad‚Äôs arrival was marked by ‚Äúbarbarism‚Äù and ‚Äúlawlessness,‚Äù as described in the Quran. The Prophet‚Äôs anti-racist mentality helped lead Arabs out of this darkness and into the light by guiding them onto the path of justice and equality. 

Bilal, who other Muslims referred to as ‚Äúmaster‚Äù because of his knowledge and grace, became the muezzin of the Prophet, meaning that he was responsible for calling Muslims to the five daily prayers. In choosing Bilal for this honorable role, Muhammad demonstrated that social exclusion and subordination based upon skin color was not to be permitted in an Islamic society."" *-Huffpost article made by sociologist Dr. Craig Considine*"
