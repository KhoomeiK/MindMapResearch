Knowing what causes snoring in the first place can help you understand why you may experience this sleeping condition and how you can properly treat it. Most people want to stop snoring but simply do not know how to. For this reason, here are some causes you have control of and may not have control of when it comes to snoring.

To start with, letâ€™s highlight some of the causes of snoring you have complete control of. First, being overweight or out of shape often leads to people snoring. Fatty tissue and a poor muscle tone can block your airways making it increasingly difficult to breathe. For this reason, get out and exercise on a regular basis to eliminate this from happening to you.

Next, put down the cigarettes and stop drinking alcohol or taking muscle relaxants prior to bed. Both smoking and drinking relaxes your muscles which can lead to nasal congestion or the tongue falling back and blocking your airway. If you have tried to stop smoking and have had no success, at least stop yourself from smoking right before bed.

The last cause you have control over if you want to stop snoring is changing your sleeping posture. By sleeping flat on your back it allows everything in your throat to relax and block the airway. Try to force yourself to sleep on your side by placing something on your back or underneath you. If you cannot do so, elevate your head by sleeping at an angle or adding more pillows to make it easier to breathe.

Unfortunately, there are some causes of snoring you simply cannot control. There are heredity issues that come into play such as having a narrow throat, a cleft palate, enlarged adenoids and many other physical attributes. The only thing you could possibly do is have surgery on certain parts of the throat, but this is not recommended.

Next, being a male comes with its downsides. Men tend to have narrower air passages than women thus making them far more likely to snore. Again, this is something you have no control over and cannot really fix.

Lastly, allergies, asthma or sinus infections can lead to snoring and they cannot always be prevented. Fortunately, if you want to stop snoring and have a sinus infection there are decongestants and cold medication you can take to help eliminate the cold as soon as possible"
