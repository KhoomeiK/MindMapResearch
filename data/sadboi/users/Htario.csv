Nothing is gonna happen for winter celebrations like Christmas except saying hello when I see them at my aunt in law's house. No texts or phone calls will I give them for their birthdays. Not gonna go over there on new year's. Fuck them. I literally, until recently, was forced to go to church and that it was a requirement to live in their house. I'm only going over to aunt in laws house cuz there will be nothing to eat at night on Thanksgiving and Christmas. Then next year going to send a text on mother's and father's day. Just waiting on the bed to get at my new place so I can move in. Even my mom is a piece of shit. They got divorced and she called my dad telling him to come get me, and she actually told me ""you see, even he doesn't want you"". Then she expects me to call her. Foh bitch.

schizophrenia,fkqxsi2,t1_fkqo00z,1584457843.0,"Think of it this way. You feel a certain way about something. Let's say you are a person that writes poems. But the people around you don't care for poetry. But you find a group of people that love poetry. You, being self conscious about your poetry don't ever post yours. But they have meetings you go to. One day you post your poetry. But along with something else. You bring in some snacks to the meeting for people to eat. One person says, ""Omfg, why did you bring these snacks?! Why can't we just have a meeting without needing to eat these? I cant believe this!"" So then you feel upset.

This is a similar situation to what you are doing. The girl posted a picture of herself. You felt to comment. But you don't have to refer to her as a camwhore just because she posted a picture. That isn't even logical. Somebody posts a picture of themselves and instantly think, oh this person is a camwhore. Then to not seem like you want to be offensive you change the word but not the message. What if somebody did that to you?

Things would go more smoothly in life for all parties involved if people would spend more time choosing to react in an appropriate manner. Remember the only thing you have absolute control over is how you react to something."
