ExNoContact,fhogqnm,t1_fhog5u8,1581755836.0,"I'm sorry you feel that way. Many, many of us DO care. Sir, your pain is justified by it's mere existence. Remember, the masses don't always get it right. I wish you the very best."
ExNoContact,fhof0rc,t3_f467ad,1581753361.0,"Many boys are raised being told to ""man up"" or ""grow a pair"" and deny their feelings, short of anger. These grown men then find it almost taboo to express their emotions. It's not seen as a ""manly"" thing to do. Unfortunately this is to their detriment. I'm sure men hurt after a breakup in most cases. And I would dare say as intensely as we do. But many suffer in silence. What we see on the outside as nonchalant, indifference is primarily a learned way to cope. And while we all know that there are exceptions, most men probably experience similar stages of grief. Some will deal with that emotion alone. Many more will find a way to circumvent dealing with those emotions using any number of distractions. 

Nonetheless, that doesn't make our stages of grief any less agonizing. It's called a break-up.....it breaks you. The lucky ones find guidance to properly face those emotions and grow from it....... others are destined to repeat the cycle of unhealthy relationships."
