BPD,fpgjh1b,t3_gdadnp,1588603919.0,"For me it was Dean Winchester when I was like 13. I didn’t really want to be him, but I wanted him to be my “loving older brother” (lmfao read: DAD). Anyway, he wasn’t real and couldn’t protect me (from my abusive home) so I just took on all his traits for like 2 years. I even dressed like him. 

Its super embarrassing and kinda sad now but also funny cause It literally just screamed  “I have daddy issues and BPD!!!” And I was so oblivious to it."

Edit: also he’s not wearing gloves lol yikes"

14 thought I was 12
15 thought I was 13
Etc etc 

It’s really annoying and like, can really get to me sometimes"
BPD,fa3cy6h,t3_e7r5rw,1575792653.0,"Idk if this answers your question exactly, but shows influence me so fucking much. I’m watching shameless right now and my cadence of speech now mirrors Fiona’s. Every time I see Lip smoke, I want to smoke. Frank mentioned Vicodin and I found a way to get a whole bottle of Vicodin (which btw not a big fan of it). I start to think like the characters, and it never used to bother me until I was dating someone. I’m with them 24/7 so they can see my change in speech, behavior, etc. It’s super embarrassing lol"

BPD,f5ck9un,t3_dnl4oa,1572136356.0,I’ve been working since I was 16 (I’m 20 now) and I’ve had six jobs (I think). My bpd never ever hindered my work until like two months ago. I don’t want to work. I can’t. Every time I go to work I dissociate. It SUCKS. I used to be the *hardest* worker. I had two full time jobs at one point. Now I work less than part time and I’m miserable lmfao

BPD,ezqh53y,t3_d1va7g,1568059216.0,"Yes! Yes yes! It makes me feel like such a bad person. The whole time my brain goes off like: am I this much of an asshole? Do I want every issue to be about me? Or am I just really sad that this person feels this way? 

For example my partner shared some stuff they were going through super casually and I was hung up on it for like four days. I wanted to say something or do something or just hold them but then I was worried that I was just doing it to make *me* feel better. And then that whole thing spiraled. Am I that self centered, am I a bad person? etc etc. Sucks so much."

BPD,ez2fsn2,t3_czvcxh,1567655314.0,"I totally get this stress, idk if it’s a bpd thing or just a me thing, but EVERY SINGLE TIME I had sex for like six months I was like “this is it. This is the time I’m pregnant.” But you used a condom, you can take plan b, but I think you should be ok unless the condom slipped or broke. 

Try to focus on other things, and distract yourself before you spiral into the existential crisis of whether or not you’d be prepared to be a mom."
BPD,eydzeyo,t3_cwq2cl,1567026733.0,"I feel like I often bounce between different stereotypes. Like the “front” my personality disorder puts forward can’t be bothered to go deeper than “the edgy girl” or “the jokester” or “the nerd”. And once I’m bored with one front, a new one is conjured up for me. Lol like covers in the CIA or something. 

However, once I started therapy, and collected a small but very loyal group of people my real personality started to poke through. I’ve found two consistent personality traits: 

- I like joking around and light roasting sessions 

- I love learning about pop culture throughout history 


I’m excited to see what else pops up! But I will say when I start experiencing an episode, I become void of personality and have to refind it when I come out of an episode. But it’s getting easier now that I know what some of my constant traits are."

BPDrecovery,evefqeb,t3_cjm85h,1564465338.0,"I don’t know if this helps or makes a LICK of sense, but: 


I’m still working on this, and fail often, but for me before I started expressing feelings positively with my SO I would “practice”. 

I’d think back to a time when I freaked out and would write down answers to:

1. Why did I freak out overall? 
2. How many and which emotions was I feeling? 

 Now when I know I’m freaking out or about to freak out I ask my SO if we can “pause” he’s really good about this. Letting me take a couple minutes to figure out which emotions I’m feeling and why they were triggered. I try my best to explain them to him. My explanation is usually jumbled and not linear but at least I got it out there. The more I practice this the more linear and collected my explanations have been. 

My bpd manifests more in sadness than anger though, so my perspective of “freaking out” is us having a conversation and then all of a sudden I’m sobbing."
