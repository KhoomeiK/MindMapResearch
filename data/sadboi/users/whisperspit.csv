psychotherapy,fk7z6az,t1_fk7bz74,1583946351.0,"I find that often these situations can not be avoided. You have the option to avoid this one, but from what you are saying, priorities in your life dictate that you ought not, that this meeting location is best for your family right now. In this case, you may very well see patients you know. My approach is to crack it wide open in session. I would even explore with them what the potential changes in the dynamic there could be and explore, like partners, what that may mean. I find that we often take a role as parents or teachers— an authority figure— rather than as a partner or advocate. It is the relationship that heals. Albeit a relationship that is entirely held to the cleanest of boundaries and decorum. 

Talk about what transference and counter transference are! Many of my clients are educated  and curious and when we talk about the intricacies of what is going on between us, the boundaries actually get cleaner and the relationship gets better."
psychotherapy,fk6aq6r,t3_fgpno5,1583897379.0,"For me— I think this is grist for the mill. Treat the eye contact at the meeting like any other sighting in any other spot in town.

You say— “we saw each other at that meeting. You saw me in another light. You heard that I too have struggles. That must have been a bit awkward. How did that all feel to you?”

I bet you $10k they will tell you it made them feel so much more at ease because they saw that you were human too, that your life is screwed up too, that you hurt. And it isn’t you just saying it in session “everyone hurts.” No— there you are, hurting, exposed, looking for help, just like me.

psychotherapy,fjhvir5,t3_fdb1zh,1583355831.0,"Dear “burning out quickly in private practice,” hear are my (LPC in PP) thoughts:


-For your work environment/camaraderie:
Propose/start a local mental health professionals Facebook group and start  a monthly meet and greet or lunch at a local bar or restaurant. 

-Scheduling:  26 AND a group is a lot. Is that average? Is that over 5 days? Is the group high need? Are your patients high functioning? Any chance we could work that into 4.5 days and have half day Fridays? Do you take lunches? What time are you done in the day? 

-Budgeting: Good on you for getting money straight. Look at the application Every Dollar budgeting. Are you just going to a scarcity model or are you really budgeting? It doesn’t have to be painful. Life is too short to be miserable. 

-Life is too short to only work. What would you tell a client who came to you like this? Improve the balance 

-This is BS. Plan a vacation NOW. Even if it is a weekend camping trip or something equally affordable 

-It is almost Spring :)


-Lexapro 10 mg is a starter dose. You should never be staying there. Either go up or switch.


-Lexapro stimulates the appetite. Period. It just does. Prozac is more weight neutral. Wellbutrin is good too. Talk to your doc. Don’t put up with this. 

-Yay husband!!!

-Colleagues can be great “supervision” or just sounding boards 

Really do meditate (love the Breathe app). Really do take the afternoon off. Really do take a nap. Really do charge full price for no shows and get paid to nap.


I see average 22-24 clients a week. I don’t work Fridays. I always take 1-1.5 hour lunches. I start at 8:30-9 and am always done at 5-5:30. I see my own counselor on Friday morning. I take a nap for every no show. I dictate notes on my drive home. I take at least one 26 minute NASA nap per day and ALWAYS nap for no shows. Or meditate for little 8-10 minute guided Breathe app meditations. We have happy hours with other counselors once a month. I try to run into my colleagues at the coffee pot every week. I walk outside for a minute between sessions. I limit my difficult clients. I keep a balance of demographics  ( not too many couples, not too many students). I take two weeks off at least a year. I save $350 each month to pay myself for slower months.

AsOneAfterInfidelity,fdnirhz,t3_em3vf3,1578586670.0,"I can tell you that I feel hate and disgust for the AP. But it is the same for how I feel about myself having been involved with him. But I’ve realized that wasn’t always the case. I NEVER pined for him. However, the situation  was a sick game between two narcissists agreeing  to make the world worse with our actions and decisions. 

I have held (and this is a very recent development of insight so I should probably said hold) this “affair” in some kind of suspended romanticism. I do not mean romance. I mean that as if there was some substantive statement about me or life from this. There is this sentimentalization  of what I was doing and what “wrestling” I was doing with my ego and the game.  This to the point of me telling my friends about it, not in a positive light mind you, but that there was SOMETHING to even talk about.  There isn’t.
The truth of the matter was that I agreed to get used and red-pilled by a calculating narcissist in the pursuit of making some narcissistic stand of my own. The truth is I was a glory-hole for a piece of shit. And I was and am and have been a piece of shit. That’s it. It’s like I took a shit on myself and I have wanted to talk about it and romanticize the suffering. And as I try to “heal,” the best I have been able to muster, until recently, is to mourn the sacrifice I am making by realizing what I have done and how I have hurt people in the my magnificent family. That’s bullshit and frankly a further betrayal. 

Bottom line— I took a shit on myself with this AP. And that is all. I made no statement about the world of myself that is in anyway worth ever thinking about again. Let me clean myself up and get back to being useful and do good in any way I can. For God’s sake, I want to clean this up and never talk about it again. If I do talk about it, it is to only process with my BS whatever he is feeling and what he needs. And the same for my 4 children.  And for them, pursue in any way I can to show and teach them to not take shits on themselves or other people. 

That’s how I feel about my AP. My husband is frankly the best person I have ever come in contact with. He is not in the same species as my AP  and by God I want that other species extinct."

I think it is very important to do it right though. This shouldn’t be used in the context of a “party drug” — at least not for the help we are trying to get here.

Your anger and resistance are key information here. Does it make you angry to think about getting better or trading in the trauma for health? This is not a challenge or criticism. Often  we resist trauma healing because 1) it has become a huge part of our identity and 2) we feel we betray ourselves (often  our younger, wounded selves) by working through it and giving it up. Does that make sense?

Have a session with your therapist next time where you don’t do any EMDR. Ask to sit and talk about whether or not he/she feels you have adequate self regulation skills. Also tell them that you want to discuss your anger and resistance. The solution is in your reaction. What is getting at you?

This is where mindfulness comes in very handy for me. And I often write down my intrusive, rapid fire thoughts and feelings to give me more leverage on them. Let me take you through this—


1) You have an overwhelming thought or feeling. It is consuming MOST of your focus. Recognize this, STOP (this is hard because we stall here and deny and negotiate with our brain) and go to step 2
2) Write down (notepad in RL or on phone) or dictate to your phone notepad what the thoughts and feelings are. Write em all down.
3) Step back and say- “these are thoughts and feelings— they are not truth sent from on high or fact from and expert (hardly!). These are thoughts and feelings. “
4)”Is it true that I should not always trust my thoughts and feelings?”  (look at historical data in your life), “especially when they are this intense and consuming. Can I suspend certainty at least a little bit?”
5) What assumptions am I making from these thoughts or feelings (he hates me, he’s made at me, he’s a dick) ? 
6) With the data that I DO have, does this meet with reality? How likely is this?
7) And let’s say it’s true— worse case scenario— (he is a dick, he is mad at you, he does hate you) what do we need to do about it? Aren’t we adults and if an adult had an issue with me, it is not my responsibility to guess it out of them. I trust that if we are both adults, you will let me know when you need something from me. 
8) next move: don’t be alone with it. Name it. If you are with someone who knows you struggle like this no matter how many times they disprove it or reassure you — TELL THEM THAT YOU ARE STRUGGLING. Tell them that you are having these overwhelming feelings and thoughts that are consuming you and you just don’t want to be alone with them. It is still YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to pull yourself out, but pretending and stuffing it will make it worse. 

Make this a ritual when you catch yourself. Know your triggers— the morning, the phone, the look, etc."
psychotherapy,f6yoyp6,t3_dtsmcs,1573289879.0,"I think that you meet them where they are in their termination. If their approach is brief and direct, your response can also be (Thank you for letting me know, I wish you only the best). If there’s more of a narrative there, you can add more. I think the message needs to be “we’re good, I get it. And I’m here if you need me.”

If it is someone actually ending things for a clinical reason, that’s worth exploring at whatever depth they are comfortable so you can learn from that rupture."

microdosing,f3vfhd7,t3_di7z6w,1571175384.0,"Therapist here.  Your therapist needs to catch up with what our field is learning/publishing/doing. Johns Hopkins just opened a clinic to do research into psychedelic-assisted therapy. Sure, it’s still illegal and underground. But this therapist should know the history (these substances were a cornerstone for AA before Tim Leary, et al effed it up).  They can have and express their hesitations, but I think curiosity and inquiry would be better than some hard consult with a colleague (lame) and calling it bad."
psychotherapy,f2z643r,t3_depoc0,1570507692.0,"My approach with a client like this is as follows:

1) Don’t assume her parents are right about her not wanting to be there. Let her tell you that directly. Maybe she wants to defy them but is looking to see what you are all about. 

2) If you learn that she really doesn’t want to be there, maybe say “Am I right to think you don’t want to be here? What do you imagine your parents want out of this for you? “

3) I wouldn’t try too hard on the hobbies/ interest thing. I mean I get it but at 13 they can smell that coming 10 ft out. Better to treat them as much like an adult as you can. 

4) I like to say- “look, what do you think that we need to discuss to get your parents off your back?” Now this sounds bad- but, this will open the door for real discussion.

5) I think it is important to say that your conversations are confidential to the greatest extent they can be (basic duty to warn/ abuse) . I tell my teens that I won’t go blabbing to their parents about just anything. And if I need to discuss something with their parents, we (client and I) will fully discuss doing so and we will agree. And I won’t do it behind their back. We will sit down together. I have never had to break this deal. Now if there were a case where I would just have to— I would and I wouldn’t look back. I kid not be okay with the betrayal but it will be my ethical duty. But I have had down dicey situations and never had this backfired. 

6) Don’t assume too much about the diagnosis of autism until you meet her. 

I know my approach is a little risky but I like to lean in on these and see what we can build."

Denying the support on purpose kind of. I don’t know but anyway- thank you.

CPTSD,f2rsljo,t3_de2sob,1570376165.0,"I did some reading about this “humiliation.” While we may be using the word in a specific context, here is what I gathered. Humiliation is from the root word in Latin - humus, meaning earth or dirt. It is a wound to our deepest selves. Our “status claims” are called into question, often for CPTSD sufferers, by our own selves rather than the real judgment of others. 


I think one of the ways that I deal with this is more in the narcissistic/borderline ways. Rather than shrinking and shutting down, I tend to splash out, over insert and assert myself, to try to fill the void I feel in this humiliation.  I am sitting in social situations hustling (a Brene Brown favorite) to combat this “status” challenge. A challenge that no one is actually making. Does that make sense?

Also, the aftermath of this is when I get home, my spouse, who has watched me “hustle” and it is cringey, has to watch me retreat into a shell on the inside and offering him only fake desperation to leave me alone to recalibrate. I leave him alone and on the outside all evening. 

Edit: add’l thought"
psychotherapy,f2qr0fo,t3_ddywo5,1570365814.0,"Sounds like you should avoid both of those. For someone to balk at CBT is, to me, weird. Like come on— this is the most basic modality that provides an easy entry into therapy for anyone at any stage. Sure there are lots of others that are wonderful and needed. But to throw out CBT is dumb. 

In my group practice, we are all self-employed, so I don’t know if, in your case, you would be employed by the practice or not. If you are, then you are constrained to their “this is how we do it” demands. If not, then you can do whatever you like. But you’ll still want to enjoy the atmosphere and camaraderie of your peers. 

Our group practice has a wonderful vibe. Friendly, supportive, fun. We have monthly lunch time meetings covering different aspects of the work,  consult group to discuss tough cases, regular social events, etc. The group’s demographic is varied, we have PhD level, Master’s Level, interns and supervisors. But no one is anyone’s boss (maybe sort of with interns & supervisors). 

Look for that! You will want to love the culture of your practice. It will make a big impact. Keep looking!"
malementalhealth,f26pv8b,t3_dc68x9,1570019954.0,"Try something entirely different that gives you meaning and purpose. College isn’t for everyone. Screw that. Is it harder to get some jobs? Yes. But maybe you need to do something else at least temporarily. What about peace corps or the like— there are hundreds of programs around the world that take young people and put them in parts of the world to help. This changes people’s lives. Are you in the US? Do a work study program somewhere. Check out John C. Campbell Folk School In NC. It is this amazing school for people to do weekend or weeklong classes in every folk trade you can think of (woodworking, blacksmithing, beading, painting, wood turning, the list is exhaustive— there is something there for you.) Work study students go for 9 weeks- 5 working around the campus (it is beautiful and the people are lovely) and then 4 weeks taking any classes you want. Room and board included. The food is amazing. 

You don’t have to follow the same path as everyone else. Be you- find meaning. Ask yourself what brings you meaning — not just what you like to do. There are so many opportunities to wake up to who you are and where you can do good. 

Also read Jordan Peterson for inspiration."
