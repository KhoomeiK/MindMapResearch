I thought you were questioning her attire under the implied idea that what she picked to wear was entirely inappropriate and should have taken a bit of closer attention as a sort of “she should know better way” rather than the way you actually took it in terms of concern and responsible adults around her further pushing her under this concept of unable autistic child

And the dress? It’s just a casual red dress... look almost maybe velvety to me? It’s not snobby or overly formal, I don’t understand why this isn’t fine for a teenage girl to go to a proper setting in. Yes I can see the bow could be a bit much but again, she probably hasn’t had much say in what she wears up until now. Most likely she probably got a say in what she wore and liked this."

Plan to only shampoo twice a week or so, maybe three. However last night I did. Scrunched a ton while in there upside down and then wrapped hair in cotton T-shirt. After about 10 minutes I took my hair out, scrunched a ton more and applied some curl defining smoothie cream by Garnier. Then I used some unfortunately not CG approved L’Oreal mousse, wrapped it in a bun, and went to bed.

Other than getting a safe mousse and gel: what else should I look for?"
