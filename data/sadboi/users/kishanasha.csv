HealthAnxiety,fq64t1d,t3_gcukbl,1589124501.0,"It is trauma in my case. 
I was watching my father die from cancer last year. Since then I have fear of coming through this awful and slow way of dying.

I must say, I've had this fear before, but nothing like this. Almost every night I dream something related to cancer and it is kinda destroing my life. I cant enjoy anything anymore because all i can think of is whether I have something or not. This is a loop of thoughts    i cant escape. I'm trying to rationalize it to myself, but there is always this question ""what if"". 

It's driving me insane and it is ruining my relationship, friendships and career. 

I'm 27 F."

derealization,f9hvt3m,t1_f9htdap,1575322728.0,No problem :) if you dont mind i want to ask how did you feel on shrooms? did you go with a full dose or a micro dose? And how was dp/dr after that? Do you think simptoms increased/decreased/stayed the same?

derealization,f9hsru6,t3_e54f87,1575321024.0,"Similiar situation. I've had really traumatic year and weed in combination with not so good mental health gave me dp/dr. I still struggle. My advice is to take a break with weed and psychedelics in general, you dont need triggers right know. Few days ago i tried weed after long break and it just worsen things up so i guess i need to wait with drugs a little bit more. 
I know dp/dr is really frustrating but it will go away eventually."

I was hoping it will shut down my brain but it just gave me body high. Then I woke up the next day and continued hating myself. i havent been in this dark mental place since 2016.
Today i decided i need professional help."

Once I did this for 2 weeks in a row when I didnt have a job. Now I'm able to take 1 day for eating junk and doing all the drugs. :)"

But I'm also interested if this is bpd thing or more like  every person alive  thing?"
BPD,f96s55o,t3_e418x8,1575151037.0,"Sure, but I imagine it as a 2 different sides of 1 rope. On 1 side are obsessive positives, on the other side are obsessive negatives. You cant be on both in the same time. If you are on the obsessive positive side... well, you are great, you are interested in something obsessively and you're gonna investigate the shit out of it and this will make you happy. If these thoughts are positive and they are doing something good to you, well i dont see a reason why you should run away from them.

I looooove this about myself. I learned so much about life, and world and countries, people, movies, technology, drugs, health, dogs, photography, pottery, fitness and so on  ... Everything you can possibly imagine. And I have sooo much on my to-do list. And I feel okay with that, this is something that keeps me going, keeping me alive and motivated. 

... The other side is a bitch."
