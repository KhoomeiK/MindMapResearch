SuicideWatch,fcm9esl,t3_ehri9o,1577767801.0,"I can relate. But sometimes your parents love you so much, its just them caring for you"
SuicideWatch,faxiza2,t3_eaonjc,1576384602.0, No dont. You are going to hurt people that cares about you. Its not going to make anything you are going through any better.

SuicideWatch,fauaita,t3_eabg4j,1576346307.0,"I get how you are feeling because that is what I feel everyday and the thing about it is my parents dont believe me. I tried telling them but they just brushed it off. My friends also dont believe me because of the fact that Im only 12 and having suicidal thoughts. 
I cant kill myself but I have thought about it and even bought pills so I can eat and overdose and die but I just couldnt. I cant bear to see my family get hurt because of my choice but I know and dread that there will be a day where I break and decide that enough is enough and kill myself. 
I know there will be. Im numb now. 
Stay Strong;"

depression_help,fatoaaw,t3_eagvpi,1576340103.0,"I am in the same position as you, Im 12
Ok so, I tried talking to my parents, of course, they blamed me for always being on the phone and said that I brought my depression and anxiety on myself. Now, Im just basically living on my couch and bed. I totally give up living life to the fullest and I think Im going to kill myself probably 3 years from now. 
Maybe you can try talking to your parents or school counselor."
depression_help,fatmy7x,t3_eak773,1576339784.0,"Leave your ex alone. 
She deserves better. 
Cold hard truth. 
Sorry Bro."
SuicideWatch,fatmqvb,t3_eajb64,1576339716.0,"I hate the holidays now. 
Holidays for me now are cleaning up my siblings shit, chores and seeing my friends go out without me and my Whatsapp empty. 

Im only 12 but I feel so empty, so numb. I cant see any future, I will probably be dead even before I turn 15. I am really numb and I gave up on everything now."
SuicideWatch,fatm741,t3_eafpo4,1576339557.0,"I really want to say 'please dont do it' but I know it wont work so, I will just say.

SuicideWatch,fatle9w,t3_eajxf4,1576339358.0,"Nonono. Dude please don't!
You don't deserve to live like this, your mom is a bitch and she doesn't deserve you, please don't kill yourself because of your mom. 
You have achieved so much in life and you still have so many things you've never explored or seen. Please don't take your own life. You will hurt those people that cares about you. 
I hope you think about what we all wrote. Please think about it and I really hope you don't kill yourself. 
Stay Strong;"

AnxietyDepression,fash0ml,t3_eaa7qd,1576327359.0,"  Yes. Especially when its exam days and I want to study but because of depression, my energy is drained really quickly and I have no motivation to study. Anxiety then stresses about it and it becomes a hell of a mess. But I do try to at least revise as much as I can so I dont fail
But being the perfectionist, I do tend to have very high, unrealistic goals that I probably cant achieve due to my current state so yeah."
depression_help,fas6x5a,t1_fan7blz,1576324129.0,Nope. I have been out of school for some time now. Since I already graduated and moving to secondary next year. So when I tell my parents about my problems they blame it on the phone.
SuicideWatch,fan27dp,t1_f9lyyey,1576220743.0,I can relate and Im turning 13 next year but Im just so done already. I dont have the courage to kill myself yet but I do feel that I will kill myself when Im 18 or 19. Can anyone else relate?
SuicideWatch,fan1nky,t3_e8gjky,1576220121.0,It is not your fault that this happened to you and if your girl thinks that maybe you've became gay from the whole traumatising experience then thats her problem but she would need some therapy too since she saw what you went through.
AnxietyDepression,fan0ycd,t3_e9xh3i,1576219351.0,"Anxiety makes me irritated at every single thing and anxious. Depression makes me tired as heck, irritated at everyone and hopeless. I try to stay cool and try to appreciate everything. I go on walks and would jog sometimes."
AnxietyDepression,fan0crt,t3_e9qq2e,1576218723.0,"I can relate, for sure. But I just want everyone here to know that you're not alone and that you can get through this. ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
