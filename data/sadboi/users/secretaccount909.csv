Struggled a lot growing up with people ""being nice"" to me only to find out they thought I was broken or dumb. Really messed with my self confidence and took a long time for me to understand my personal value.

I am the way I am, love me or hate me based on me, not my diagnosis.

My last name is really *really* uncommon, under 200 results on ancestry(dot)com when you look for it, most are from when my grandparents immigrated. 

When I google her name the obituary from the funeral home was first, and the second result was the listing from the same funeral home of where they had her indexed. Even has her picture on the listing."

If they have been together a long time I think you should add her, she is family to him. A lot of stuff at funerals are for the living to mourn and small things like that change make everyone feel closer.

My s/o and I have been together for 8 years. There has been a few family members on his side that have passed and if he was included, so was I. The first inclusion would have been around the 5 year mark of our relationship.

This has made me feel closer to him and his family, it's not a crazy mentioned either just ""*Name* leaves behind *Boyfriends Name (My Name*) ..."" Which is pretty obvious that this is a girlfriend/spouse that is not a direct blood relation.

It's just not something to cause a rift about, this is a trying time where most try to hold close all that they love, this may just be a way for your brother to do that."

Reading this was kinda like a blast from the past. Hi, I used to be a shitty girlfriend and not be able to take care of myself

Yes me and my S/O argued all the time because of my issues, honestly I almost broke up with him because I don’t understand why I couldn’t take care of myself. 

I am now 2 years diagnosed as a high functioning autist. I was able to hold down a job because there is always rules, easy for me to follow because OCD kept me on top the habits. 

Home life always suffered though, couldn’t manage my life. Overwhelmed, anxious, not being able to focus, over focus, all kinds of feelings. Like honestly I don’t know how chocolate got on my forehead either but I can tell you that there was probably a hurricane in my brain because taste, especially sweet tastes, get me excited and overwhelmed. 

After therapy. Easier. Diagnosis helped a lot, know how to integrate things into home life better because it stopped being about what’s wrong with me. Became about how finding the resource and tools that would help me. 

Hey, I can also maintain a home now, yay. I feel like I do a lot better at work now too because my management skills got way better too. 

Wouldn’t have been able to come this far without my S/O, he’s been my stable ground for me to learn. 

Even though I love him so much, it’s grows bigger everyday because of how happy I am to be his partner and takes these steps forward with him."

If it's true you are spotting after 1/2 hour of not taking your pill you need to go talk to your doctor, yesterday.

OP you're holding onto what everyone else should be doing for you way to much. Start looking at what you can do for yourself and like seriously. Talk to your doctor.

Honestly the routine you have is my 'If I have children this will be really important' day dream. My parents were slobs and I never learned how to take care of myself properly.  


My s/o helped me learned cause hes a clean freak and I use the same routine as you expect I don't have to go to bed at 9:30 hehe.   


But in the evening I have a timer set on google home to tidy, it only takes me 20 minutes, now cleaning is never an issue. Wish this was bonding I had with my parents instead of feeling like my s/o had to 'clean me up'.

My parents got divorced when I was in grade 3, parents started their dating game when I was starting puberty.

We talk about dating like we are close friends, and people, not like its some super secret I should never know about.

Parents are people too, they got kinks and whatever. My parents raised me to never be ashamed to talk to them, I would hope they aren't ashamed to talk to me either."

My brother and I always had the older brother, younger sister quarrels, now that I'm older I appreciate that my parents tried to manage both of our wants instead of the other sibling getting the veto. 

I also really appreciate the time with both my parents. My dad was always goofy and would do bad jokes, and my mom made sure I learned how to treat animals with respect, like feeding geese grains instead of bread. 

Just like, so nice to think back on. Most the memories I have with my brother and my parents my brother was always calling me a baby, or that I liked baby stuff. I get it, he was older growing out of that stuff but it would put a damper on my enjoyment. I think my parents took the smart choice."
AmItheAsshole,f2xvige,t1_f2w1piw,1570483022.0,"I think you are NTA.  


My parents did this with my brother and I and we are biological. The thing was that it was a two way train thought.   


I didn't like rides and I liked animals, so when my brother was at school parents would take me to the petting zoo and what not, just like your are planning to do.  


I'm honestly happy it was like that because my brother would always hold on to how boring I was for being scared of rides.  


I generally got babysat by grandparents when he went and I think it was better for him to go on the big rides with both my parents instead of them having to switch because I was reluctant to even look at roller coasters.  


Only time this dynamic changed was sometimes parents would invite my grandparents, grandparents would take me to do boring stuff, while my parents did the rides and stuff with my brother.   


My brother is only 3 years older than me."

AmItheAsshole,f27cbxc,t1_f25wg0j,1570035053.0,"Honestly OP, I know it hurts because its so important to you, but sometimes names aren't the things people hold onto. When my s/o's grandma passed away he was at work, and I answered the call when she (edit: His Aunt) phoned us.

When I got home I said ""Hey I'm sorry to tell you, Gloria passed away today"" and his immediate response was ""Who's thats?"" and it was pretty awkward for me to be like... 'Uh, your grandma?'.

I would also say that I'm really tight with his family, and talk to them lots (more than he does) and I more so relate what I know about them to them, than their names. Like the uncle who is a firefighter, or the uncle who built his own house, I get people mixed up, I didn't grow up with them but I still care about them.

I suck for not knowing their names, for sure. I still love an appreciate them and try to get better at each gathering."
relationships,f22c73v,t1_f227x23,1569886229.0,"Op's girlfriend has feelings too, emotions are messy and confusing.  I feel bad for OP because he was clearly vulnerable and seems like his intentions were to just not be alone with these thoughts. 

  
It's not a *have to* situation, it's messy let's talk about feelings situation. She is allowed to have her own thoughts, and apparently needs some reassurance on her own feelings.  


Op needs room and understanding for what he is going through, his girlfriend also needs room to feel afraid or insecure. There is nothing wrong with any of the feelings going on, it's just difficult to navigate it so everyone is comfortable.  


Op doesn't *have to* do anything he's not comfortable with. Although, it would be a good idea to express all the feelings he has and not just the ones he's uncertain about.   


Really hope everything can turn around, if OP girl isn't feeling vulnerable she may be really excited to help OP discover some of these new things about himself.   


It's really not unreasonable to be afraid for anyone, it's a natural reaction. Working through emotions like that make really strong relationships, misunderstandings happen, doesn't mean anyone is in the wrong."

Advice,eypt4mu,t3_cy4pm9,1567310397.0,"You question kinda hits me in a weird spot, surprised there are not comments? 

My mom passed away 5 years ago and I really miss her. I think a lot about the things I wish I could do with her still. 

Going through all the stuff she kept it really showed me how much I grew away from her. I wish I understood, and really realized that she was my biggest fan while I grew up. 

You have to start healing yourself it sounds like though, you should probably go to anger management or get some therapy. Don’t let becoming a better and healthy person be put off until tomorrow.

Being able to make your mum even more proud as you recover I think would be really nice for both of you. 

Depending on her mental state she may be able to support you through some of your healing too.. So, maybe talk to her?

At the end of the day I really just wish I thanked my mom more too. You really should just say thank you to her every moment you can. 

There was a time in her life where everything you did was exciting for her, change the tables, let her know that all the little things she does that remind you of home, and her warmth, Thank her. 

Sorry about your dad OP, that sounds really hard to live with."
