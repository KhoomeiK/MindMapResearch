DCEUleaks,f38jehp,t1_f35l914,1570737045.0,"I agree, the pacing was good, and it does a fantastic job at building tension. I refer to it being slow as mainly the scenes where we really learn about Arthur's mom, her real subtle dialogue and Zazie Beets' (sorry if I misspelled) character arc. Also as a side note I really feel like the movie should have emphasized the political turmoil in Gotham, as there weren't a lot of scenes that built up the unrest among the joker fanboys, it pretty much goes straight from Arthur killing the people on the train to all the people wearing masks attacking the cops outside of the movie screening"
jobs,f35xt4o,t3_dft470,1570696691.0,"Currently in this situation myself. Had a complete bs job during the summer building cabinets, making piss poor money, and quit and moved back home with nothing lined up. Long story short, I've been out of money for 2 weeks and the other posters on this thread are right, it can really sting your motivation and lead you into depression. I'd say take some time off to regroup and gather yourself rather than quit, you'll thank yourself in the long run. Best of luck to you"
DCEUleaks,f34yr7x,t1_f34vyr1,1570664052.0,"If a Lex Luthor standalone is indeed next, I think they should at least incorporate Superman or Clark Kent because I feel like Lex Luthor relies more on Superman than Joker does Batman and that seems to be what the Joker movie pinpoints, instead of him just trying to go after batman, his main motive is pretty much chaos. But Lex Luthor wouldn't work well by himself imo because his ulterior motive is to save mankind from Superman, but then again, people said the same thing about Joker before it came out. Either way, I would love to see that movie"
DCEUleaks,f34yfu5,t1_f34vs3p,1570663822.0,"True, that makes sense, but if that IS the standard for DC Black, should it be made official, I think Bane or Ra's Al Ghul would be a good pick. Maybe even a Nightwing movie?"
DCEUleaks,f0v5pv9,t3_d6jmwf,1568965098.0,"I didn't watch the movie but I did read the script and watched a few of the leaked scenes and it's dark. Definitely a step up from the Nolan trilogy. The killing is pretty spontaneous and chilling, Joker showing absolutely zero remorse. Pretty dark stuff."
