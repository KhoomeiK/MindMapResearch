My psychiatrist increased my antidepressant (I was taking a tiny baby dose before) so that should help, maybe. we'll see lol. I am in and out of depression most of the year.

My boyfriend brought it to my attention tonight that all these things are happening because I'm depressed. I didn't really put it together, somehow. 
I have a psychiatrist too and I see him on the 1st. I guess we could increase my Wellbutrin, since I'm on the tiniest dosage. I'm scared to do that though because the last time I did that, I feel like I put on a little weight. But I was also trying another med at that time which definitely caused weight gain . So I don't know if the Wellbutrin did that or not. 

I may sound whiny, but I'm tired of working hard and having to push through things... Maybe that is the depression talking. I just feel like that's been my entire life. Pushing through to get to the other side and then there being even more stuff to push through after that.

I am disabled by it and can't do certain things on my own,but I am also finishing up my BA in psychology and I am applying to grad school to become a therapist. But I had issues before the onset of my Schizoaffective. Sure, there's always the potential for me to get worse. But it's just as likely that I'll be able to live a long and fulfilling life.

schizophrenia,flzljs7,t1_flxrsl1,1585626652.0,i'm trying to do stuff i like during the day in between coursework and housework but i've been pushing myself in school for so long i've kind of lost track of my hobbies... plus lack of motivation from my antipsychotic doesn't help either. it takes the joy out of just about everything
bipolar2,flvvp64,t3_frb4je,1585533220.0,"i read a really weird article the other day on psychologytoday and it just made me think like it's almost as if they let just anyone with a degree write articles for them... coz the article i read was about your hair growing back after struggling with an eating disorder and this lady said something like ""i've never seen an anorexic with good hair"" and i was just kind of like wtf? i mean is that really necessary to say? shouldn't you be inspiring hope?"
Psychosis,flvu7wj,t3_frdc09,1585532226.0,"my psychosis comes in a steady stream with upticks and bigger episodes in between. this is my last semester in undergrad and I am getting 4 As and 1 B+, which I plan on bumping up to another A on this upcoming exam. i talked to my psychiatrist about my schooling and he said ""oh you're going for an AA? good for you"" and i said ""no, BA"" and he looked shocked and said ""congratulations!"" and then I started talking about my upcoming grad school interviews and he continued to look astounded... i think psychiatrists aren't always used to having patients/clients who are high functioning or high-ish functioning and they have this heuristic in their heads that psychotic/severely mentally ill = low functioning. which is definitely not always the case. I have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type, a pretty severe mental illness, but i drive, i go to university, i maintain good grades and blah blah blah all that, but i do have limitations, such as i can';t go outside on my own except for my route to school, i get panic attacks if i am left alone for too long, i can't socialize with anyone but my boyfriend for more than 3 hours (i like to keep it to 1 hour, but 3 hours MAX), i have a really hard time making and keeping friendships, and various eating disorder related behaviors. but that doesn't mean i can't do normal people stuff or achieve things, you know? i still have dreams and aspirations"

schizophrenia,fllzohp,t3_fpjnz9,1585271221.0,"well when my doctor sent me the paperwork that said my diagnosis on it i just kind of sat there quietly thinking about it... i accepted it right away since i had been in treatment for bipolar for about a year and a half already, which included antipsychotics. i still get delusional and paranoid a lot and it takes someone explaining to me why my delusions and paranoia aren't based in reality for me to move on. it's an ongoing process, it's not just suddenly i snap out of it and everything is fine for the rest of time."
