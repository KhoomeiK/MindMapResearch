zoloft,fdjb3nk,t3_elkbqm,1578463866.0,Yeah same here. I told my doctor it wasn’t helping at all but he keeps insisting to keep doing it. he kept saying that it was the safest drug to prescribe I think that’s why he’s consistent about it. Still doesn’t help. You should try to talk to your doctor maybe you can get something else to help you out or something on top of that.

I got this out of body feeling like everything was way too focused and that I wasn’t just part of a room but all of it. Sucks feeling trapped. I hella couldn’t wait to get out of the restaurant.

zoloft,fcvp3k1,t1_fcvo38f,1578006917.0,Omg same here! I have been thinking that I’m going crazy or something but it gives me reassurance that it’s the medication.
