All we know for sure is that he is the incarnation of unpredictability. Most other super villains are so afraid of him that they don’t even want to appear on his radar, and the few villains who DO underestimate him...lets just say that why won’t be making that mistake again. Or any other mistake, for that matter. We don’t even know if the Joker is actually insane, or if he is just pure evil. 

I’m not sure if you’ve read any of his stories but read some of his classic stories. Wikipedia him. He is very interesting. The fact that on the surface he seems so frail and easily beaten yet he ALWAYS comes out relatively unscathed is perplexing, yet part of who he is and what he is capable of. Batman has that exact same uncanny ability. 

Joker is arguably the greatest villain of all time in ALL of fiction...second perhaps only to Darth Vader."

But if you are going through *THOUSANDS* of back issues, it can cause a slight headache. No big deal though, digging through back issues is fun so that weighs out any aggravations! Lol"
comicbookcollecting,fqmc6h6,t1_fqlow20,1589475027.0,"Off the top of my head, the series dates and volume numbers don’t always line up between the two(for example, on the Key Collector app a series may be listed as “vol 3, 2013” but the same series on MyComicShop.com may be listed as “volume 2, 2012”). Key Collector also doesn’t put the key issues in numerical order at times, so if you are looking for let’s say “issue 1”, it may be between issue numbers 12 and 13. With Key Collector, legacy numbering can bounce between volumes also(example of this is Fantastic Four. In the mid 500’s, the series is split between volume 1 and 3, back to vol 1, then to volume 4). If you are looking for a specific variant cover on MyComicShop.com, they don’t have everything scanned or listed(I don’t expect them to), but it may be hard to figure out what volume a variant book is listed on there without the scan/listing because as I said before, the volume and tear numbers don’t always match up between sites...regardless of what is on the inside book cover.

If I come across this again with anything else specific, I’ll be sure to edit this and list it. I have searched/compared literal thousands of books on the Key Collector app and MyComicShop.com, over the last couple months...that’s how I have noticed it.

Edit: the Key Collector app has Moon Knight vol 7 as starting in 2018 while MyComicShop.com has vol 7 as starting in 2017. Interestingly, the Key Collector app has issues 188 and 189 as being published in January 2017...while MyComicShop.com has said issues as being published in January 2018."
