Stupid.  You can put optics on an M2 machine gun and do everything that M82 can  do mounted without sacrificing the ability to go full auto so you can be  effective if vehicle is moving or you need area fire or volume of fire.   People have used optics mounted M2 since at least Vietnam. It’s not a  novel concept.  But using a sniper rifle on a vehicle mount is beyond  stupid. If the vehicle is moving you are ineffective. If the vehicle is  stopped - well then you can get just set up with the bipod on the hood  and be just as stable.""
