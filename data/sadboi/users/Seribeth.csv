Not gonna discount there probably are a lot of BPD diagnosed folks out there who aren't that self aware and are a nightmare to be around.   


But what about those of us who are in recovery? I've sat almost a year of intensive therapy. I still have my flaws, sure, but things are nowhere near as bad as they used to be at the height of this illness.   


Yet I still suffer PTSD as an after effect of living with a complete abusive narcissist. I've had to vent about this very recently in the BPD group because I feel that's the only safe place to do so without receiving stigma and having someone validate what I went through and how I could be feeling as a result of that.   


I totally get the straight up advice of ""leave him/her, they'll never change"" and ""just don't get involved with people with BPD, they'll fuck you over"", but for crying out loud, some situations and people do change. People can't be constantly painted with the same brush all of the time. And I believe it says a lot about people who can't forgive and forget to be honest. Who choose to paint everyone the same colour."

Sometimes they just don't care. They only care about how they feel and what they see, no matter how hard we try to convince them.    


Those people are 100% toxic to us. The irony is we don't want to lose them due to the nature of BPD, but we have to for our own long term emotional wellbeing.

However, I have to disagree a little. Maybe two years ago I'd call you a psycho and have a tantrum about how it's really empathy for others. I have sat DBT since and I'm still in one on one therapy today. I wouldn't say I'm there 100% of the time, but I'm nowhere near as blindsided and consumed with my own emotions as I used to be. 

Yet still hurt for people. Or be ecstatically happy for them; whatever the situation calls for. I guess an example would be the Australian bushfires happening at the moment. The country is in so much pain and has lost so much. What emotional beneficial gain would I have from being able to feel that same level of distress for them? Like... it's one of those where I sometimes have to talk to myself and be like ""... it isn't YOUR house burning down, wtf. Get a grip"". 

You could argue we incorporate and take that pain on board to further fuel our own sense of hurt about other situations, but again I dont believe I'm there all of the time now. I'm pretty good at mulling my emotions over and deciding what is legit, what isn't, and what I'm being a brat about."

Picking out what \*your\* morals and principles are in life should hopefully help. I learned briefly in DBT that we can often be easily emotionally lead to living our lives around other peoples morals and ideals which is never really going to end well. This is just one area in life where we can emotionally derail, so it helps to figure out what's important to you whilst learning how to accept and respect others morals and beliefs."

So for example, I was triggered a few days ago and spiralled downhill massively, embarking on self destructive behaviours that I eventually realised would make others worry and feel upset. I apologised and accepted I had behaved destructively. However in a separate situation I feel I am repeatedly mistreated and triggered by someone who I can't just ignore, cut out and walk away from.

I might have BPD, but I also have a lot more self respect than he will ever give me credit for. 

If he triggers me, which is a lot as he also likes to blame me and play on my guilt for having post natal depression, then he finds it impossible to remain calm and to say 'Woah hang on, this is an over reaction, I just meant x, y and z'. Instead he calls me a 'using whore' and a 'despicable cunt'.

After some years of this, it almost feels like my stomach is now trained to just not care. I get hunger pangs but they're nowhere near as painful as they used to be  and at the height of my 'self punishment' I convinced myself that hunger pains were a good thing.

I certainly fell down a rabbit hole within the first year of diagnosis, half of me felt relieved because as you mentioned, suddenly life began to make more sense.  But there were also the accompanying thoughts of 'so... my personality is broken? I'M broken?'   


You are not. And there is suitable treatment that is very effective providing you're willing to work hard at learning to regulate your emotions.   


Also, I don't discount serial killers having BPD... but I'm fairly sure most are on the ASPD spectrum (anti-social personality) if you're going by basic 'textbook' definition. I like to think we feel too deeply to be capable of committing such atrocities!"

I always found the 'check-in's helpful to be honest.

My advice is: don't run before you can walk. Take your therapy and new relationship slow and steady. Give yourself plenty of breathing space to assess your emotions when you need to. 

Remember 'Facts before Thoughts'. I learned this in therapy recently and it does help a lot. Do your thoughts and feelings fit the facts? It helps to work out what you feel you should be feeling rather than your mind running away with every emotion possible."
BPD,f1yy4cs,t3_db39dh,1569827670.0,"For me, I see it as breaking the wheel. I was abused by my BPD mother. I went through a period of time where I had one hell of a break down, received the diagnosis myself, and for about a year afterwards fell off the sanity wagon as I struggled to come to terms with what happened to me - but also what was still happening to me at that point. I was also in an abusive romantic relationship at the time which completely broke down over that year. There were different contributing factors for the relationship failing, but it was my BPD that made things so intense.   


Two years later I have started therapy and can clearly see my faults and where much of my behaviour at the time was totally unacceptable. But it has been the longest and hardest two years of my life, having to rewire my brain and learn what should be normal social skills again for a person of my age (33).   


But... I have four children. I owe it to them to get better and try to be the mother they need me to be. I've already parented differently from my own mother based on knowing the hurt I went through with her and not wanting to put that on my own children, but putting therapy skills to use and just being as honest with them as I can be about my diagnosis and overall health has helped massively.  


The relationship that broke down? He still believes I'm very broken and apparently looking for a villain. Someone to point the finger at and blame for my past behaviour. I've lost count of how many different ways I can try to say ""I can apologise and accept responsibility for my behaviour. But I can't and won't do it for yours, and you hurt me a lot too. You reacted disgracefully to me at the time and wouldn't let me go so I could help myself."" Apparently me wanting to end the relationship at the time was just another method of control and manipulation. 

&#x200B;

The last argument we got into - only a couple of days ago - he was apparently 'trauma bonded' and has been through a lot with his own therapy (which is more like counselling rather than intensive therapy). The situation was still all about him and his reluctance to see that he contributed to my ill health at the time and is now actively spreading stigma of BPD because he literally can't look at himself. Pulling up stigma of BPD for people who have done wrong is an easy 'get out of jail free' card for not having to look at their own bad behaviour and it unfortunately happens far too often.   


We have a child together and this really hurts. I don't know how to get through to that level of narcissism. It's something he has to see on his own, if he can, and until then I just feel for our child more than anyone. But it could be a very long time before he's able to see his faults and I have to try and make the best of things and accept he can no longer be an active part of my life.   


I'm an artist and raise BPD awareness with every piece I create and post on social media. I'm open about my diagnosis and take much of the stigma on the chin. I believe by being open and fighting against the stigma, making more people aware of DBT and of recovering borderline's, can only help to better inform in the long run. At least this is my hope - one of my dreams actually - because I know a lot of people with this condition now and they are some of the BEST people I know. We deserve better."

So if a friend has upset you, write down why and just sit and think on it a little before reacting. My train of thought with a situation like this generally goes ""would 'normal' people feel pissed by this?"" We should still trust our instincts despite having dysregulated emotions. Having BPD just makes it a little harder, but not impossible.   


Also, rely  on your support network with the issue. Tell them and see what they think.

I'd been assessed for bipolar but was told it wasn't that as I was too happy, ha! Moods were far too rapidly changing for bipolar.

It was as I was trying to describe things to my partner at the time that I had an epiphany. I told him it felt like I had two personalities almost. It was the word 'personality' that made me think of borderline personality so I went and read up on it.

The info I got back hit me like a ton of bricks, having hit all 9 of the criteria for diagnosis at some point over the last 10 years. I saw a CPN for immediate support who agreed BPD was very likely, then it was formally diagnosed by a perinatal psychiatrist a few months later as I'd also become pregnant (worst timing ever!)

This was Jan 2017. I'm now receiving DBT and CAT therapy and doing pretty well with recovery. I had to wait a long time for it mostly due to the pregnancy and then being hit with severe post-natal depression after. They like you to be in a reasonably stable and self aware place before starting therapy as its incredibly intensive. 

I wouldn't worry too much about receiving the full diagnosis. I think what's important is your health team recognise it's cluster B and they're likely wanting to monitor you further before giving it a label maybe."

(I've been lucky enough to not be judged by any health professional that has worked with me so far. The fact I feel 'lucky' over that though shouts volumes)."
BPD,f0c3rkr,t3_d4cxxv,1568535346.0,"Going through a very difficult time at the moment with regards to actively being stigmatized by someone I barely know for no valid reason (other than having BPD). They're hurting a lot of people around them - not just me - but it obviously takes me more time to bring the severity of my emotions down. 

Skills:   


* Opposite action. I felt angry so changed locations and did some drawing and singing. Singing is really good stress relief for me.  

* Distress tolerance. I see this as opposite action as well, to be honest. Just surrounded myself with particular smells and sounds that comfort me. 

Along with skillful avoidance and self care, this is my daily set of skills I use at the moment. I want to learn more around interpersonal effectiveness."
BPD,f078928,t1_f0722g6,1568455063.0,Much prefer this suggestion for now. Doesn't seem necessary to have two DBT groups running but this one could do with a kick up the bum in terms of activity for sure - for those of us actively practicing our DBT skills.
BPD,f03ourx,t1_f03oox6,1568363926.0,Maybe we should make one!
BPD,f03n6gq,t3_d3jls3,1568361550.0,"I can't help but I'm following as I'd like this too. I started DBT over a month ago and my group is wonderful and supportive - we have our own Whatsapp group and everything :D But I'd love to find a place on Reddit where I can talk about my DBT experiences and how I put the skills into use. Bounce feedback off other DBT'ers, etc."

Casefile,ezoqa5d,t3_curcto,1568026609.0,"Yeah... listening to Belanglo now and it's insane how these people aren't reported missing or looked into for weeks. They're backpackers during a time when mobile phones weren't being used widespread, but it's like police didn't trust the families when they all said these kids were responsible and often checked in at home at least a couple of times a week to let them know they were safe.   


Quite often my irritation is down to lack of police action, although in one episode (Case 35: Operation Mayan) an officer was fired due to not following the book when it came to investigating and arresting the killer, instead following his instincts. I understand WHY these laws are in place, primarily to prevent misjustice, but I don't believe following the book works every single time either. And at the end of the day, he caught the right person AND helped solve an additional murder separate to the one he was investigating!"
TombRaider,eznstk8,t3_d1mwgg,1568010976.0,Good question! This is why they should make a couple more installments! :D
BPD,ezns27h,t3_d1jqhq,1568010631.0,"I have diagnosed BPD and PMDD, and yes, the week running up to my period is Hell â„¢. The very real feelings of suicidal ideation are terrifying, along with the usual low patience threshold and bursting into tears sporadically. I often advise women with BPD to also track their cycles as it should make things easier with regards to separating and figuring out certain symptoms. I'll be receiving another round of hormone treatment at gynaecology again soon and if it helps, a full hysterectomy in on the cards."
thoseconspiracyguys,eznoibv,t3_d1blh0,1568009068.0,"No, but Casefile podcast also covers him and it's, err, more detailed I guess. After hearing I'm kinda glad TCG didn't get into the nitty gritty's!"
Watercolor,ezevmhi,t1_ezagi71,1567869410.0,Keep trying :) Watercolour can be a devil of a medium to try and tame!
BPD4BPD,ezcy39u,t3_d0mspu,1567842209.0,"Oh yeah, seen it all before. Even had it thrown at me during and after a relationship with a sociopath - and I think it's because he just hated women for the most.   


It's just opinion. The writer probably got hurt by someone with BPD before and that was it. Boom."
BPD,ezcwzz3,t3_d0lbdz,1567841732.0,Everyday in one way or another.
TombRaider,ez8s1xe,t1_ez8rxuj,1567756351.0,Haha xD Exactly!
BPD,eyn4avz,t3_cxoc3f,1567230776.0,Yep. I went down this path last year. Only good enough for intimacy. Not for understanding or supporting.
BPD,eybdeik,t1_eybc8o4,1566981784.0,"I think she realised I was a naive and mouldable child. My dad split when I was 7 and I felt I became alone and vulnerable as a result (I had a great relationship with him up until he left.) Mum saw it as someone to manipulate and keep on her side maybe? Because despite the abuse, I was a fiercely loyal daughter right up until my late 20's. I'm possibly not doing a great job of explaining this because there were so many other factors going on that contributed to this behaviour as well (including alcoholism and drug abuse) but it often felt like any opinion or decision I made that didn't suit her was incorrect. 

But basically as a result - yes. I have very little belief in myself and my decisions. Couple it with being on the receiving end of domestic abuse and violence from two past partners and yeah. It's common for people with BPD to have identity disturbances, but I literally feel lost and unsure about everything all of the time."
BPD,eyb46a4,t1_eyb3b8r,1566975602.0,"I firmly believe my mum was a cause to me developing BPD. I think I was manipulated from a young age and she used emotional and psychological bullying to 'keep me in check'. Sometimes physical abuse too. We haven't spoken in over a year and in that time I've been doing some 'research'. Getting back in touch with family members I haven't seen or spoken to in years (because she had issues with them, so she'd pull her kids out of the family unit too) to ask them about her behaviour and what they think. So far I'm learning that she's always been a destructive and narcissistic whirlwind.   


She would blow hot and cold on me all of the time, including over decisions being made, and yeah - it got to a point where I no longer trust myself. No longer trust my instincts with certain situations, etc."
BPD,eyazepc,t3_cwa646,1566972824.0,"Yeah I've been here. For me I wonder if it's my mind regressing to be honest - it throws me back to growing up and my narc mother encouraging me to make decisions, then telling me I'm wrong before the decision was finally made, or disapproving of it afterwards."
drawing,ey7jiic,t1_ey6cmg1,1566885956.0,"It's a legit question :) And no worries, I did also use a solvent for blending so I guess it's a little tricky to tell what medium was used at first."

BPD,ey237qm,t1_ey235bl,1566722212.0,Yeah I know it's going to feel hard and raw. I'm so pleased it's helping you :)
BPD,ey221tr,t1_ey0xoa6,1566720714.0,I start CAT soon. I'm not looking forward to it. I have so much built up confusement and trauma to get out there. Do you find it's helping you?
BPD,ey2205c,t1_ey0bnzo,1566720656.0,"This was my upbringing. Dad split when I was 7. She never had a positive word to say about him and I blamed him a lot for abandonment issues. I looked up to mum like she was some kind of wonder woman for raising me and my brother and working her way up the career ladder.   


And then after 10 years of picking up the pieces of her failed relationships in her 40's, 10 years of my children and I being her world when she wasn't in a relationship and then dropped the moment she was, 10 years of nothing being her fault... the penny finally dropped."

abusiverelationships,exx53q4,t3_cuowx5,1566630401.0,"In my experience, no they do not change. I'd say you have a duty to yourself and your children to leave as soon as you can before things become worse. I imagine your trust in him has been shattered and staying together so he can continue to abuse you will not fix that, will it? Putting space and time between you and him will help your self esteem and to take stock of what you have and what you would like. It'll also teach the children that his behaviour toward you is not acceptable and leaving is the repercussions of it. I'd be worried what the stress and anxiety is also doing to your pregnancy (I hope it's all healthy and well, by the way!)  


Maybe suggest some time/space and see how he takes it. The mere suggestion. If he gets angry, abusive, doesn't even want to understand how and why you feel the way you do - you'll have your answer I suppose."
Casefile,exx3907,t3_cucx4g,1566629413.0,"I'm working my way through all of them, but listened to the Amy Allwine case yesterday and damn - that is some crazy shit. Suspenseful and twisted throughout."
raisedbynarcissists,exhd0wm,t3_csut1o,1566301556.0,"""It was my job to set your body's boundaries"". Wt-actual-f.

 Well done you for rising above it and walking away!"
BPD,ex1jzcj,t3_cr0jtn,1565947742.0,"I'd attribute this to your diagnosis of SPD personally. I came out of a relationship some time ago with someone who had SPD and I'm fairly sure this was him too. He wouldn't admit to or talk about his thoughts and feelings in this respect, but I know people with SPD actively avoid and feel disconnected with everything around them, yet crave social adequacy. I feel people with BPD are more sociable and actively seek out interactions to satiate that need for attention and praise.   


Dissociation can be problematic for both disorders. I won't discount that people with BPD can have long spells of dissociating, but I don't know many who do. It's mostly a defense mechanism for when life becomes too stressful or traumatic and can be just as rapid cycling as any other emotion someone with BPD can feel.  


My ex partner was definitely a daydreamer but was also anti-social, had slight agoraphobia and arguably had traits of a sociopath too. I feel people with BPD are more sociable and although they can display many behaviours of narcissism, it's almost impossible to not care or feel for too long - in my experience!"
wow,ex1isym,t3_cr0pzb,1565946693.0,Blizz really should add more stuff like this in with expansions.
BPD,ewr7nlv,t3_cpcm9k,1565697549.0,I do this too. Prefer to be alone to ride it out. I do risk feeling even more isolated as a result but I'd rather that than be OTT with other people.
BPD,ewr7hph,t1_ewp6g8j,1565697386.0,Yeah. Not being able to trust your feelings and emotions is exactly it. It's fucking exhausting having to second guess yourself all the time.
BPD,ewr7fix,t3_cpf00y,1565697325.0,"I hear this entirely. Especially wishing you could live a day without the disorder, just to feel a speck of normality."
Graffiti,ewr706f,t3_cpinuj,1565696894.0,Wow. I'd definitely class this as more of a mural. But either way it's amazing.
drawing,eweswmn,t3_cnondx,1565336320.0,Well done :) I enjoy seeing depictions of mental health art.
BPD,evxps0n,t3_cls7ko,1564901892.0,"Yes BPD is a legitimate disorder. You must meet at least five of the nine criteria for diagnosis, and although there is no cure, there are treatments to deal with many of the symptoms, usually tied to therapy rather than medication - but meds can help too.   


I also have diagnosed PMDD and although I can understand how you made the connection between the two being similar with regards to symptoms, it \*is\* different. You'll need to be very on the ball with tracking your menstrual cycle, along with keeping a mood diary for the times when you aren't due on your period. Unfortunately some women who suffer PMDD can begin to feel their symptoms as early as two weeks before they start menstruating, so there is overlap of mood and hormones that can be SO tricky to dissect.   


My BPD triggers usually revolve around fear and paranoia, and rarely jump into psychosis. If I \*do\* develop psychosis or can't stop crying in a certain day, that's usually PMDD. You have to really listen to your body and mind, and obviously getting professional medical help is essential. You \*cannot\* self diagnose these two conditions really."
BPD,evxorx9,t3_clk50o,1564900619.0,Thank you for the reminder <3
abusiverelationships,evv7r6c,t3_cl8sc3,1564823995.0,"I've been in two abusive relationships. One of which I question was even a relationship, because it only ever seemed to work and  be ticking along/happy when it was on his terms. But both times I got out due to their intent to be in control and to constantly criticize me. One was even physically abusive, even when pregnant with his child. The other... I just don't think I did anything right in his eyes? I don't really know. I had so much awful things going on in life separate to that relationship - and he did very little to help or understand. I knew there wouldn't be any future."
