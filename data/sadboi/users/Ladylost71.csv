Don't know where to start really.
What made you start cutting...
Have you tried the distraction techniques...
Using an elastic band round the arm and twang it...
Or ice..hold ice on you..
Not saying these will work, but anything is worth a try..
Headphones and loud music..
You're on the right path if you're using health services..cbt, and such.

Sh is an addiction as well. 
There is no easy fix, you have to want to stop.
Use family members if you can for distraction. I found once it wasn't a big taboo secret and everyone knew, that it became less of a mindfuck in itself for me. Just the fact that I could talk to people if I felt that way helped me not worry about it so much.
If that makes sense.
Sorry I can't help more. Like I said, not an easy fix.
But good luck on your journey.
Take care and stay safe ❤"
depression,fmfyzab,t3_fv1bt7,1586037795.0,"Be careful it is an addiction like any other.
Your body releases natural endorphins that react with the body's opiate receptors, that helps with pain relief.

It's not something you're just going to grow out of. It's an addiction just like any other. 
I'm definitely over 18 lol. 
So no you're not alone..there is a sub for adult sh. 
I've been sh on and off for over 25 yrs, I've never fully managed to stop. I can go for months though without. Not saying it's not a struggle, because it is sometimes. But I've just accepted it,  that's what I am, and I don't worry too much about relapse, and in a strange way it makes me need it less. Don't know Why, maybe it's just acceptance, that and telling certain people about it. Like my kids know( all grown adults with their own lives) my parents know, older generation just don't get it really, my parents are in their 70s, and bless them they deal with it without judgement or anything. I'm very lucky for my family to support me like they do. I've currently been clean 5 months.  So, don't know what else to say really, but yes older people still struggle with it. Maybe we just don't discuss it as much. 
But I felt exactly the same before I found this sub,  that I must be one of only a few. I think the younger end are far more willing to discuss it openly. I hid it for a really long time. I mean really hid it, gave stupid excuses for long sleeves all the time, went to great lengths to hide it. I mean I still wear long sleeves, but if I'm doing something and sleeve rolls up I don't panic anymore. 
People just look shocked, disgusted even, and be like eugh what's that what happened. My answer these days....
Ask a stupid question 
Get a stupid answer.
With a nice big smile of course. 
Because you can't not know looking at it.

I would ask for a different doctor for an opinion.
Sometimes I think they up the meds cos it's easier for them. And like I say, he says he feels loads better and not depressed.

Self harm is an addiction, when you cut you release endorphins, it makes you feel relief. Feel better for a while, reminds us we can still feel something, right.

But yes the urges are normal just like with any other addiction, it's your go to thing when all else fails. 
Do you use a therapist or anything. Have you got anyone on hand to call when you get urges,

There has to be someone somewhere, studying just that I should imagine, emotional sensitivity and chosen mechanisms for coping. Apparently it's all about changing the way we perceive things.

It's harder now they've grown up and left. Because I feel like what's the point. No purpose in life. I don't even work. But I keep going. 
And your maths yea I got noticeably depressed in between child 3 and 4. 
You're right about people not wanting to stay around depression though. My partner put up with a lot. Affected him a lot as well. We split 12 months ago. It's been hard but I feel better for not having to think too much about being fake happy so as not to cause stress, and that sounds really selfish but I had to put me first.

And styro is when it looks white inside. 
Stay safe and take care stranger ❤"

It doesn't help when you feel like that and your partner doesn't support you.
Sorry can't say much to help..but really hope for your own peace of mind you find a way through this.

depression,ewtj5wm,t1_ewtioet,1565746408.0,"Even so. You were 5 months ago and she's 2 months gone...its good that you're panicking...means that you've at least had a good think about it lol. And you'll think twice about using protection next time..
(Once again sorry to come across as nagging)
You should just chill out over it now. It's not yours . And the period thing. She's had some since if she's 2 months gone. 

Always carry condoms 
Better safe than sorry 😂"
selfharm,ewthoob,t3_cq262a,1565745422.0,"Of course there's a point to your post. It's obviously upset you that you have sh'ed. We are capable of relapsing. And that's quite normal. What's done is done...it is what it is. All you can do is try. Just be careful and make sure to look after your cuts so they don't get infected. 
I'm sorry you feel so bad about things.
I'd send a hug but I don't know how to lol.
Just keep your chin up
Stay safe and take care stranger ❤"
depression,ewtgiar,t3_cq1vgu,1565744645.0,"It can't be yours. Not after that long. She would be 5 months gone. 
Believe...ive had 4. 
You should use protection anyhow. It's not just for pregnancy either, just in case of stds as well. 
Have these conversations with my son's too. 
Hope you don't feel like I'm nagging lol. 
Just be careful. 
Take care ❤"
