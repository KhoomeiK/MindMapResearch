“Kill them with kindness” does not work with these people. Keep your distance and don’t go out of your way to give a compliment unless it’s how you TRULY feel!

Empower yourself by documenting incidents, practicing self care, and standing up for yourself in the most professional way possible! Recently, I quit a job bc of a person who was wildly unprofessional and a straight up bully, but I only quit because she was my ONLY coworker. 

I had to work closely with her everyday! I had no other coworkers to form relationships with - it was hell! I have a history of not being assertive so it felt damn good asserting myself with this bully however, I still dealt with anxiety.  I found I was spending more time standing up for myself than learning my job (she was my trainer and a terribly inefficient one at that). 

A little over a month into the job, I decided to cut my losses and quit. Needless to say, I will never consider working for a small company again."

Most minorities have to work, pay rent/bills, worry about housing and food insecurity, and take care of their family members! I myself attended school while homeless. But go ahead and continue rubbing in the fact that you live in a rich area of NY, attended Harvard and swim ten laps before work.....

Here in NY, a common question is “are you disabled” and “are you a veteran” then of course the typical race and ethnicity BS. From what I have understood, companies get paid for hiring disabled employees but there’s a catch to that - they can also use your self-disclosure to deny you. They of course, wouldn’t say that’s why you weren’t considered for the job.

I never mention my disability and I probably wouldn’t ever disclose the fact that I’m gay - if this were the case.  Sometimes I struggle with even disclosing my race and ethnicity (White Race/Hispanic) but oblige for the sake of statistical data.

jobs,fk0ag5e,t3_fa2ewb,1583749659.0,"Bad experience: I applied to a patient registrar position through a temp agency.  The recruiter ghosted me for weeks after telling me I am qualified and would be interviewing with a hospital - one I’ve always wanted to work here for in NYC. I emailed her to check on the status of my application and never received a response.

Weeks later, she sends me an email “congratulations! You got the interview! Please respond immediately. Time sensitive.” I had already started a new job but decided to entertain this because it’s a well known hospital. ($15 an hour for temp-grossly underpaid in comparison to their permanent employees) 

Well I scheduled the interview and left my new job two hours early to interview with this hospital.  I drove over an hour in the rain, parked my car in valet and made it at the exact time my interview was scheduled for.  When I arrived to this MASSIVE hospital, I looked at my email and realized the recruiter never provided me with the floor the interview would be taking place. I called her - no response. No one in the lobby knew who the hell my interviewers were when I showed them their names.  I didn’t even know the department as it wasn’t provided by the recruiter.

I decided to leave. I wasn’t walking into this interview late and I told the recruiter this in a voicemail. I retrieved my car from valet and paid $22 for parking less than half an hour. 

When my phone service finally returned (no service in this massive hospital), a message came in from the recruiter. She texted me 15 minutes after I had contacted her to tell me the interview was taking place on the 23rd floor and gave me the number to call my interviewer. By this time, I was already in my car crying while driving back home. 

A waste of time and money and I got NO apology. Just a robotic voice telling me the interviewer is willing to interview me next Monday because they were running late. I declined and said the location was not a good fit for me. Recruiter claims my chances of ever working at this hospital are not ruined, but I’m afraid she may be wrong."
