But I don't don't think a mode like that would be as easy to implement as you hope it would be.

Still, I would like for Nintendo to offer developers the option to introduce some sort of a ""High Power"" mode that they could chose to implement in their games when a Switch is connected to wall power.

In fact, I think that is what the Mortal Kombat devs had to do to hit 60 fps in the first place. 

But, I don't see devs being happy about the fact that they now have to optimize their games for a completely new mode. Their work is not really easy, and fixing problems and bugs for two modes must be challenging enough as is.

That was actually the reason I went for the Lite. It is not only cheaper and smaller, but the main reason I wanted a big Switch was to be able to play party games with my friends.

Guitar,f21614y,t1_f214vo7,1569868362.0,"You know what? 

Maybe what you can do is get an acoustic archtop that you like, that already uses a piezo pickup system.

And then add an electric pickups to that. You might have to change to electric guitar strings though."
Guitar,f214vo7,t1_f212r63,1569867939.0,"Well, you can just put acoustic strings on an electric guitar without having to modify it.

However, they won't work right. The electric pickups won't pick up the sound of the acoustic strings correctly. 
Look it up on youtube, I know I've seen a video that tries it out.

I think what you are looking for is an electric guitar that has a piezo system as well. That way you get the electric guitar sound, plus the acoustic style sound from the piezo.

I think, that Ibanez has some like that. I know that some Les Pauls have the piezo system. I think that there are some PRS that have them as well. I think that the Slash tobacco burst Les Paul from the mid 2000s had that system exactly.

As to string gauge and height, there is really not much to say. Basically, the gauge you use will help you determine the height that you can use comfortably. And you can get both styles of strings in the gauge that you want, but they may be a bit harder to find."

You can try to get a 9V power supply and see if that helps. If not, I would probably return it. 

A pic of how you are connecting your pedal would be helpful. 

I had a Boss DS-2 that had a remote out jack. Once, I connected my guitar there, and was baffled as to why it wouldn't turn on. I figured it out, plugged the guitar into the correct jack and it worked instantly. Maybe you are doing something similar?"
Guitar,f210fhz,t1_f20zxsp,1569866289.0,"So if you want to learn pinch harmonics and tapping, practice Crazy Train by Ozzy Osbourne for example. Listen to the studio version, and then listen to Zakk Wylde's live version and understand their differences. Zakk uses pinch harmonics a lot, so learning the song will force you to learn how to use them in the context of a song. 

The solo also uses tapping, which you will have to practice to be able to play."
Guitar,f20zxsp,t3_db9t0x,1569866110.0,"Honestly, I would just continue to keep learning new songs.

Don't just try to learn a riff here, and a solo there. Try to get the whole song down, and practice being able to play it completely and correctly.

Learning new songs will force you to practice different styles as you need to. Plus, there is a great sense of achievement when you are finally able to play an entire song correctly.

That will also force you to apply music theory to the guitar. 

Also, don't just rely on tabs or youtube videos to learn. They help at first, but I find that they limit your learning capabilities when you become dependant on them. Learn how to use your ears for learning.

So, learn new songs, learn them to their entirety. Practice them. And good luck!"
Guitar,f20y8cf,t3_dbacvn,1569865518.0,"I would go Katana. I like the 12 inch speaker, plus Boss know what they are doing when it comes to guitar tone.

Marshalls are great for tube amps, but their lower end offering always leave me wanting more."
Guitar,f20xh8n,t3_dbat5x,1569865259.0,"A lot to talk about here. The main difference between them are the strings. They both use metal strings, but they are made up of different metals. 

Electric guitar strings are often made with a steel core and nickel coat, and they are often a lighter gauge. Most people use either 9s or 10s, which refer to the high e string gauge. 

Acoustic guitar strings are normally made with a steel core as well, but with a phosphor bronze alloy for a coat, and they are normally a heavier gauge. Normal acoustic strings are 11s or 12s. 

As to using acoustic guitar strings on electric guitars, you can. But they won't work correctly due to the differences in pickup technologies.

Electric guitar pickups use magnets to work. The movement of the metal strings in the magnetic field of the pickups create a small voltage that becomes your sound. 

Acoustic guitar pickups are different. They are normally piezo pickups, which use the actual vibrations of the string to pick up sound. Some acoustic guitars even use a microphone inside the guitar. So they don't need the metal on the strings to work.

Other differences in set up are that electric guitars often have a lower action, or string height. Plus, electric guitars often have hardware than can be easily tweaked into setting your guitar exactly as you want it. Acoustic guitars are often harder to set up because of the nature of their hardware.

Hope this helps!"

Guitar,f20sd8o,t3_dbe9m3,1569863461.0,"The way I keep inspired is by listening to new music. Let me explain:

I used to play a lot of Metallica as a teenager, but I feel out of love after playing only Metallica and metal for a few years.

Then I got really into Led Zeppelin, and that inspired me to pick up my guitar and learn Zeppelin stuff. Now, I can play a lot of Zeppelin songs, which are always fun, but I got a bit tired of only playing Zeppelin as well.

Then I got into Sabbath, then into jazz, then into Black Keys, then into Graveyard, then into Hendrix, and so on.

The key is to always keep moving.

So, listen to new music, learn it, rinse and repeat. That also has the added benefit that learning different styles will force you to practice different aspects of guitar playing.

After a while, you'll notice that you can just hear something being played, and play it almost immediately. And that is very useful when writting music, which is what keeps me going nowadays.

Good luck!"
Guitar,f20qu3h,t1_f20nf7x,1569862902.0,"I'll have to agree and also disagree here.

I bought a 12 string a year ago and I love it! In my case, it doesn't sit around gathering dust all the time, but I definitely don't play it as much as my six string.

guitarpedals,f20nzwq,t1_f20m6ie,1569861923.0,"Also consider getting an EQ pedal. It seems that you might just want to ""fit"" better with the other guitarist. An EQ pedal is the way to do it."
Guitar,f20mq0y,t1_f20looe,1569861484.0,"I hear you man.

I wanted to get an attenuator too, but they are impossible to find in Mexico. At least I haven't been able to find one."
Guitar,f20mhj6,t1_f20igvi,1569861403.0,I've considered it. Thanks for the suggestion!
guitarpedals,f20m6ie,t3_db310f,1569861300.0,"I completely understand your problem. What you need is a very low gain OD. I use a MXR Modified O.D. for that. It's very versatile, and can do low gain really well.

Another option is a Fulltone Fulldrive. I like that they can be tweaked into a lot of different sounds, and they are quite cheap on the used market.

I tried the Soul Food, but never actually liked it. It wasn't warm enough for me. I haven't tried any other Klon style pedal, but I've heard that the Ryra Klone is great. The MXR Sugar Drive is another inexpensive option."
guitarpedals,f20l6ja,t3_db3nwz,1569860962.0,"I use the Way Huge Havalina Fuzz. I loved it when I used my Supro, not so much with my Vox."
guitarpedals,f20kamz,t3_db5da4,1569860666.0,"The FTSW stands for Foot Switch. They control different parameters on your amp. I really don't know what the foot switch does on the Champion 100, but you can look it up on your manual.

The PreOut and PwrIn jacks are your FX loop. Amplifiers have two sections, the preamp and the power amp. The preamp is where you get your tone, it includes your volume, gain, and EQ knobs. The power amp is what actually makes the sound louder, is what drives the speaker. 

What an FX loop does, is that it allows you to plug effects between your preamp and your power amp. So you can get some distortion from your pre amp, and add some delay and reverb after that. 

So the PreOut is what comes out of the preamp, and your PwrIn is what you plug into the power amp.

A relatively ""normal"" signal chain would be: Guitar - Boost/OD/Distortion pedals - Preamp - FX Loop (Modulation/Delay/Reverb pedals) - Power Amp.

As for what the extra jacks in your pedals are, you really have to consult the manuals for them. They could be tap tempos, external expression controls, stereo jacks, etc. 

Hope this helps!"
guitarpedals,f20gihg,t3_db6b37,1569859419.0,"I don't know about metal. But for classic rock I use a Catalinbread DLS (which are a bit pricey, even used), and a Fulldrive 2 (10th anniversary edition). They get the tones I need at low volumes.

If I can crank my amp, I would just use that. 

Also, I like modulation. I use the EHX Good Vibes, and my Supro's tremolo section is always on, but it's very subtle. 

When I played metal as a teenager, I used my modelling amp's ""rectifier"" setting. I would probably get a Mesa Flux Drive if I ever wanted to play metal again. Another option would be a Friedman BE-OD. The Boss MT-2, and MXR Fullbore Metal don't do it for me.

I don't use delay or reverb that much. But I do have a Boss DD-7 that has proven very useful. And I payed only $80 for it used at my local store. Great deal!"
guitarpedals,f20f30u,t1_f206ezh,1569858915.0,"I've never tried the Dark Side, but on all the demos I've heard on youtube, the distortion is way too strong for Gilmour. But again, I've never tried one so...."
Guitar,f20e3g3,t1_f20dhrv,1569858581.0,"I use Bias FX sometimes. Cranking the headphones does help with the inspiration thing sometimes, but there's still that missing feel of tube amps. 

Thanks for the suggestion!"
Guitar,f20do2l,t1_f20d8df,1569858439.0,"I've seen them at stores, but I've never considered them. I might get one!"
