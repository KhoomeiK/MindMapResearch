So. If I had full control of it, I would just try not to dream anything at all."

I played The Sims for more than 2 hours which is nice because I used to be able to do so for hours some months ago but lately I wasn’t in the mood to play for more than 5 minutes. Also it was the first day I didn’t have a mental breakdown in like one month!!!! And I didn’t think about giving it all up once! I didn’t go to the gym and I was supposed to but that’s fine, I still can go tomorrow :]"

AskReddit,f2iweof,t3_ddh8vm,1570263698.0,"My former uncle (or my aunt’s ex husband) and I both have arachnophobia. I have this memory from when I was 4 and I was at my aunt and uncle’s with my mom. They used to live in the country in a small house and on this specific memory, we were all in the kitchen. They were talking and I was playing near the door that was half open, until this huge spider came in. Like, it was the size of a cat or something and I remember it being red-ish. Something like that must exist only in Australia and although I’m in the southern hemisphere, I live far, far away from Australia. So, everyone got away from the spider, and my uncle, because he started panicking, set fire to it and it ran away. I remember that I was crying and that was when my arachnophobia came to be. 

When I ask my mom, my aunt and my uncle, none of them seem to remember anything like this and let’s be honest, that would be a pretty memorable thing to experience. And I ask my uncle why he has arachnophobia, he doesn’t know how, he only knows it started suddenly when he was already an adult. Weird."

Now I know this is somewhat common, but I like to feel the texture of my hair with my finger when it’s twirled around it, and I keep caressing it...? It’s oddly soothing. I was doing it while reading this thread and couldn’t think of a weird habit of mine and then “Oh, I’m doing it right now!” lmao."
