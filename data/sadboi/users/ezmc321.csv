LifeProTips,fiid094,t1_ficpum4,1582419865.0,"A modification of technique if you end up not liking the visualization of breath:

Try to feel sensations of the breath leaving/coming into your nose in as much detail as you can without straining. This object is intentionally very hard to discern details of, at first, but this will train your sense of clarity like building a muscle. When the mind wanders (it will) just gently bring it back and congratulate yourself on catching it (positive feedback trains the subconscious process of monitoring for distractions)

If you want to try a more body based approach: imagine your attention is scanning all the parts of your body in as much detail as possible. Try to locate sensations there, even if those sensations are just that your finger is ""there"". Move around methodically untill you've covered all the areas. It's ok if an area feels ""blank""Try - just notice it's blank and move on, or hang out there to see if you can find a sense of something. Learn it slow, but experiment occasionally seeing what it feels like to sense the body by moving around attention quickly.

You can do either one of these in your daily life- just take a few seconds to check your breathing or feel your body. Doing so often in your daily life will train you to sustain meditation throughout your day."

General premise he's suggesting is that starting out in concentration or vipassana practises creates a meditator/observer that must be eventually taken care of. And that a way around that is to start from the nondual side and go into vipassana/concentration techniques.

Loch Kelly's book ""way of effortless mindfulness"" also covers this.

In my own experience, I find my metta and vipassana practice is much ""better"" when it starts with nondual glimpses. I've gotten *this close* to jhana using metta, when K was not sitting regularly, simply by doing self-inquiry. 

To me, it seems like TMI and other similar frameworks can induce a lot of striving that ultimately has to be addressed.

Psychedelics are way different when you're meditating a lot. I think a lot of meditators start meditating, look back on their psychedelic experiences as *less than* their new meditative experiences, and then don't revisit in with their newfound powers of concentration.

Edit: forgot to add, low dose vaporized dmt has a strong flavor of do-nothing/bare awareness/non-dual flavor to it. I find high doses completely unproductive and basically just visual fireworks.

Double edit: most non-microdose amounts of psychedelics are like.. slightly annoying to meditate with because there's so much distracting input in the peripheral awareness, even if you're locked into your object of meditation. The higher the dose the harder it feels to stay locked in."

The conclusion of ""lowered her ego defenses"" didn't resonate with me. It seems more likely to me that taking psychedelics in an environment most people would find challenging is more of a reestablishing-control-after-a-traumatic-experience kind of deal.

Her experience the first time is precisely why you don't ""seek out"" drugs at an event."

With that said, it's a really common opinion, so maybe I'm in the wrong here? I just know I feel most romantic relationships are unhealthy and I wouldn't want to be in them."

Skiing at Alta/Bird is some of the most technical terrain around, biking is amazing, and the desert is really accessable. I live in the avenues and literally hop on the BST to bobsled from my house.

Only downside skiing in either LCC/BCC on a weekend pow day is *crazy* traffic. If you can find a way to ski mid week it's wayyy better, but that's not everyone's priority. I ski tour to get around that, and it's an incredible city for backcountry touring- one of the only places you can get up early enough to ski before work."

Look more into Ingram's comparisons of different awakening models. Lot's of discussions about the problems with what he calls ""psychological perfection models"".
Kenneth Folk, for instance, has added several stages above what Daniel Ingram calls ""technical fourth path"" and explained them in detail.

Many monks and meditation teachers have been awakened to a pretty standard degree, but there is a general reticence to discuss it publicly because of the variety of problems this causes.

There are teachers, for instance, that say insight is not enough for ethical behavior. There's an idea of ""wake up, grow up, show up"", where growing up refers to healing psychologically and maturing and is to be done in addition to insight practice.

It's fine if you don't believe in awakening, but I haven't seen many ""serious meditators"" on r/secularbuddhism... The comments the other day on ""how much do you meditate?"" Seemed to average 30mins a day. This is definitely not considered enough to make progress in insight."
