HistoryMemes,fqx60rn,t3_gld7iv,1589726587.0,IfI remember correctly Hitler didn't always hate jews. So it could be possible that he wouldn't even hate jews.
PlayStationSolutions,fqx5e64,t3_glgdv5,1589726188.0,Sounds like you may have shut it down in a wrong way.
hearthstone,fqrbrr0,t1_fqqrhj3,1589581304.0,You mean on Hearthstone? That it's not just some bot? What an odd thing to ask. Why would a bot send you a friend request? Or am I confused.
HistoryMemes,fqpdxm9,t3_gk2uj4,1589543792.0,Our friend Kim as well!

Rainbow6,fpzlyvt,t1_fpyqctz,1589020070.0,New house is only gonna be in casual though
RainbowSixSiegePS4,fpzlrqy,t3_ggczfg,1589019989.0,Hey just a btw when the game lags a lot it isn't always ddos. I have had actual ddos like once this season. Other times it has been server issues.
teenagers,fpyvjnq,t3_gg8xcz,1589009642.0,Well... depends on the school.
ps4friends,fpwjoyn,t3_gfy2y7,1588964642.0,I mostly play siege. PSN: Juusto3_3

PlayStationSolutions,fpgyqk6,t3_gd6a0m,1588611893.0,Most things aren't cross platform compatible. I've never heard of that cabela thing so it's unlikely the folks at Sony remembered it.

RainbowSixSiegePS4,fpds5yr,t1_fpdhbot,1588533142.0,Did you seriously come on the ps4 subreddit to shit on consoles? Dude.
RainbowSixSiegePS4,fpdb4eg,t3_gcte6d,1588523501.0,"Google it. It's quite easy and gets more results than asking here. After you've done that you should ask here. Anyhow, it's usually a server issue but if it's not you should see ubi support for help."
HistoryMemes,fpcz4dp,t1_fpcw5cn,1588516289.0,No. The special ops agents excecuted 5 NK regular navy guys not civilians. The navy fellas didn't wish to commit suicide with the special ops so the special ops shot them.
SiegeAcademy,fpcxxxo,t3_gcl0f2,1588515513.0,"It seems like you are putting a lot of effort on learning things and getting better. I just want to remind you that Rainbow is a really really hard game. You might fall back down from gold but you should always remember that in rainbow you cannot become a good in a week or a month. It'll probably take atleast half a year before you get to plat. From there on it takes even longer. Now of course if you are good at fps games it might not take you as long and vice versa. 
Main thing I want you to remember is to never give up cus this game takes time and with time there usually are results."
Rainbow6,fp6r26s,t1_fp6qqnx,1588357120.0,Well there are competetive people on console for sure. Me and all my friends for example.

SuicideWatch,fp6oi8u,t3_g5ejp3,1588355861.0,I'm kinda proud since to me people really can tell anything and I'm fine with it. I've learned to not care about anything people say or do. It helped me get through some bullying. I still want to help people though.
PlayStationSolutions,fp6g7gu,t3_gbl2r8,1588351797.0,Yikes pulling the plug wasn't the best idea... you should have forced it to shut down by holding down the powerbutton for 10 seconds.
im14andthisisdeep,fp2gkqq,t1_fp2et6m,1588261393.0,I'm honestly not sure if you are trolling or not. Of course he didn't get rich by helping but now that he is rich he can help.

PlayStationSolutions,foujy4r,t1_fouj366,1588085445.0,Could also be something that will just pass with time. Some delay bug maybe. Maybe check on it in a few days etc.
PlayStationSolutions,foujpts,t1_fouj366,1588085326.0,"Hmm... they've been having some trouble with the console version ownership. It should be all clear now though. You should ask support they should know everything about payment related issues. Anyhow, if you get it working we should play sometime. 7D2D is a great game. My PSN: Juusto3_3"
