BipolarReddit,fft0o18,t3_ev2lcn,1580200797.0,"Hi! Not a professional, but it sounds like you know you should be happy, chemically you aren't. When I'm like this I usually up my meds, but they dont work the greatest if I smoke or drink. If therapy is how you usually do things maybe try one of those online ones, I think there are free ones! Worse case there are suicide hotlines, and I bet they would listen to you and how your feeling exactly at the moment you need it! Good luck to you!"
BipolarReddit,ffszi7s,t1_ffsz5ra,1580199181.0,"I believe you can definitely learn from the past! That's what I've done, for the most part. My symptoms reoccur and as ive gotten older, I know myself better. Therapy has helped a little, the techniques ive learned. I don't regularly go to therapy, only when big changes are going on in life, just in case a break down is likely. This is something I know about myself. Usually I can catch them, but this current time I didn't and it has really sucked. And that is OK! Its part of the illness. I hope the best for you!"
BipolarReddit,ffsdrsr,t1_ffs9ru7,1580179270.0,"It helped that my boss was so understanding. I'm very lucky.  It was hard to do. Im starting to feel more comfortable that I did it, I want to enjoy life and not be drained. Thank you for your support!"

bipolar,fdijpc1,t3_elf0sh,1578444433.0,Just started this last night. 10 min later projectile vomit...so far tonight ive had everything down for at least a half hour. Feeling ok. Good luck!
bipolar,fdijg53,t3_elk9q0,1578444271.0,"When I was younger my mom would often think each medicine would have the same side effects.  I was on something when I was younger that if I had any alcohol I would projectile vomit. Now, numerous medications later, I can drink a little, but if I do it often, I lose my stability. Currently trying to recover from that. Feels like I'm starting my life all over from step one."
