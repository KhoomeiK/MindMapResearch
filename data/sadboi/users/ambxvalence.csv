youre not gonna give chemotherapy to someone because they have diabetes, youre not gonna put a cast on someone who has a migrane. diagnoses serve to find the proper treatment.

'me telling you that you have to do it yourself, does not mean im saying things are easy or to just get over it. what i am saying and trying to show you, is that you DO have a choice. you can choose to make the right steps towards your recovery, you can choose to fight this everyday. it is understandable if you dont, but you do have that power. you are the only one that is able to fight this, no one is going to do it for you.'
