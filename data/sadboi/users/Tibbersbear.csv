I was able to stay on my regular medication (Zoloft) during pregnancy and I can still breastfeed on it. I was seeing a therapist before getting pregnant and had continued seeing them until around November (they moved). 

I am trying to be gentle on myself. It's so hard when I feel like I'm not good enough for anyone. I love this baby more than anything in the world. I never knew I could love someone so much! I just worry about being enough for him or doing good by him. My relationship with my mom wasn't a very good one growing up. So I just get scared that I won't be a good mom for him. 

Luckily my husband is super supportive and he's done this before (he has a daughter) and he knows how to help me. I'm so grateful for him."

BPDmemes,fr5fhkq,t1_fr5aca9,1589907705.0,"I feel like when I was pregnant it was more erratic at times, especially during the beginning. I'd be super happy, super irritable, and then super sad all within a few hours. The hormones at the beginning go nuts so it was pretty comparable to pms. Normally my swings aren't too erratic. I could go days and feel good. No major swings. It could be spread out between hours during the day. 

Example, normally I could wake up, be in a bad mood... then a few hours later be in a great mood. Then get irritable and be pissy for an hour or two. Then feel guilty for being upset and get sad... Then be perfectly fine the rest of the day. 

During PMS it's all over the place all day. In the beginning of pregnancy the same. Then it got better. Since I had a really traumatic pregnancy the first time, this pregnancy I was suicidal for the first few months. I was really depressed about everything. Then it got better. My moods were very stable. I'd go days feeling happy, or sad, or irritable. No swings. 

Now postpartum, it's relatively up and down throughout the day. I'm really happy, or I feel really sad. I feel more worthless most of the time than angry. I get irritable with others sometimes. But my swings are mostly non existent. 

I haven't had any splits in a long time. Mostly because of my meds and therapy and a good toolbox of coping skills. But this is the best way I can describe how I experience it."
Showerthoughts,fr53uu3,t1_fr50ux2,1589902027.0,"Seriously! I just had a baby, so a lot of my family and friends have bought me things from Amazon. My mom told me she bought about six small things off the registry and they shipped at the same time. Three came in one box, one by itself, and two in separate plastic bubble envelopes. Plus they all were either packaged with those big bubble protective bags, covered in bubble wrap, shrink wrapped, and packaged in a box or bag itself. 

Why??? They weren't breakable things. Some socks, soft toys, and bibs. They seriously could have been put into one box. I get that some stuff comes from different fulfillment centers....but imho clothing items don't need serious protection like that....

I, at least, recycle what I can. But there's areas that don't have recycling. My parents live in a rural area and they have to take their recycling to a recycling center an hour away. They don't have pick up... When I lived there I would take it for them. Every two weeks we'd fill my dad's truck and I'd drive it to the center. They don't do it now because they don't have the time.

breakingmom,fr4wpjq,t3_gmin23,1589898314.0,"I started to do things for myself a few years ago without caring. My stepdaughter gets upset sometimes because I have a special stash of little Debbies. Or gets mad because I'm ""hogging"" the TV.

 I've explained that there are a lot of things *she* gets just to *herself* (partly because I don't want it) and her father and I deserve to have some things to ourselves. She's finally accepted that. She also used to cry or give some bad attitude because to her it was ""so unfair!"" Luckily now she's old enough to understand that sometimes mom deserves something to herself. 

I remember growing up my parents had some stuff they did, or bought, that was only for them. Anytime we went to the mall, they'd get Starbucks. Only them. My dad had special snacks we weren't allowed, my mom got a few hours to watch her favorite shows in the morning or evening. But it wasn't until I was a teenager that they began doing that, because my uncle and aunt told them they *needed* to have some stuff for themselves. Before that they shared everything with us kids. And they were **stressed**. 

So you do things for yourself! Let them kiddos cry and throw fits. They'll get the point, and they'll accept it sooner or later. It's good for your emotional well-being. Be selfish. Being a parent is the most selfless thing someone can do. So it's okay.

She lives in Louisiana so in the summer it get super hot. She kept complaining about her electric bill being high despite her not being home most of the time. It was because when she did go to her house she turned to a/c back on and it took it forever to cool her house down. It would usually stay on for a few hours trying to cool the whole house down. 

When I was watching her house while she was out of country I kept the a/c on auto. She came back to a lower bill and was convinced I had done something my father and uncle refused to do.

Same with window units. I had a house that had two window units. One in the main room and one near my my bedroom.

Oxy, hydros, some type of narcotic pain killers. He was a really good friend of my parents and he brought it up causally to them. Just about how some of his pills had been going missing. My mom suggested maybe it was the woman he was seeing. 

That woman accused me. I guess she caught wind that he was getting suspicious. 

Some weekends I'd have to go to the house to babysit early in the morning. Like 5am. My mom would drop me off, I'd nap on the couch until kids woke up. Well the lady had spent the night. I'd never met her, never saw her. The guy usually didn't have girls stay over when his kids were home. I knew he'd been seeing someone for awhile, just never saw her. 

Well, this day she had spent the night, got ready for work, and left shortly after I got there. I was dozing on the couch. I just thought it was one of the kids that got up and was lightly sleeping waiting for them to come ask me for breakfast. When I saw it was a lady leaving I just didn't think anything of it. I knew he was dating someone. It was okay. Didn't surprise me. 

I guess she put some of the pills in my purse I left on the kitchen counter. She then told the guy I babysat for that she saw me in the kitchen that morning putting something in my purse. He told my parents, my parents checked my purse, found the sandwich bag with two pills in it. I got in fucking huge trouble. I was 16 and supposed to get my license that spring. My parents told me that I wouldn't. They said I'd babysit for him for free (he disagreed with that and continued to pay me but I had to put it *all* in the bank instead of 50% so no spending money). I was to go to school, go babysit, come home. They called me names and we're awful about the whole thing.

Well, a month later, he had to borrow the lady's car because his was in the shop. She stayed at his house and he took her car to work. He found two bottles that had first gone missing, empty, under the seat. All because he dropped his cellphone. 

He was never harsh to me about the whole thing. He had even said that he still trusted me, that teens will be teens. His kids were always safe and they loved me. My parents never really apologized for how awful they were about it. He freaked out on the lady though. My mom actually went to pick up his kids (they were the same ages as my brother and sister and we're good friends too) and he told her what he planned to do.

I've dealt with idiotic comments that I'm a white girl and can't claim to be Latina by my black and Hispanic friends. I've also dealt with the ignorance that comes with not knowing the difference between Hispanics and Latinos. I've literally been told that I call myself Latina because it sounds ""fancy"".

But apparently I'm not really Latina because I don't speak Spanish and I was raised here. I'm just a dumb white girl. ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌  being a chick doesn't help either. 

My dad has had trouble with the blatant racism plenty of times. He was born and partially raised in Panama. He moved to the states at a young age. He spent most of his life in Alabama so he has a thick southern accent. But he speaks Spanish. He has an olive complexion (like me and my siblings do) and people have mistaken him as Mexican, Italian (he has a big nose), Pakistani (black hair, thick beard), Middle Eastern, God the list goes on. 

Also, since he looks Mexican, and he was born in Panama on a US military base to a US soldier (so on US soil making him a US citizen) he's had problems with jobs reporting him to INS. Especially in Texas. He's a US citizen. It's just like if you were a child of a US military member who was born on base in Germany. But since Panama was given back to the Panamanians in the 90's (I think late 90's not sure) it's forgotten for a lot of people. Some people aren't even aware of it. He's had such a rough time before because of it. Employers will say his birth certificate is faked. He's a border jumper. It's ridiculous."
TrueAskReddit,fprs2zg,t3_geymha,1588860943.0,"Communication. With your kid, your spouse, everyone in your life. Everyone wants to help you or give you unsolicited advice. If you communicate boundaries it's almost always a fight to keep them. Your mom may get offended that you don't want her to post pictures on social media without your permission. You father in law may get pissy if you tell him not to buy your kid a certain toy. Forget your reasons. *They* want to do it, so why should they listen to *you*. 

I've always stood my ground because in the end it's **my** freaking kid. I don't care if Nana wants to buy kiddo a huge ass toy that they don't need. It won't fit in my house, they won't play with it often, or they already have something similar. I couldn't care less if Pop wants to tag his friend Nancy in our photos. I don't fucking know Nancy or her friends. So I don't want my kid's photo going around the internet. 

In the years I've been married to my husband and been the sole caretaker of my stepdaughter, my in laws (especially my mother-in-law) have boundary stomped. I felt almost helpless because she's not truly my kid. But now that I have my son I'm trying to give less of a fuck to their feelings. These are my kids and if I can I will protect them from certain things and stand my ground. They can't really make boundaries of their own, so I do it for them. It causes some tension, sometimes, but when I tell them that I want my children to be safe, or that I'm teaching my children not to be expectant of certain things, they just leave it. We all want to be happy and that's all that fucking matters. Fighting about letting you buy my kid a certain toy is only making things tense and upsetting. If I say no...just leave it and move on.

Also, education. Being you kid's advocate when it comes to school. We've moved...*a lot* and we've had great, amazing, wonderful teachers. But we've also had ones who just don't seem to care. If your kid comes to you about a teacher, a subject, a class, that they feel like they don't understand. Or if their grades are really bad and nothing is being done about it, reach out. If the teacher seems like they really don't care, talk to someone else about it. School is important (of course) and if you don't recognize the signs early on it could be harmful. 

This all comes back to communication. Teachers have your kid more often than you and usually good teachers will want to help your kiddo. Ask questions on how to help at home if kiddo is struggling. Ask how they're doing in school periodically. Ask if there is anything more you can do if they are struggling. If you can't get the answers from teacher, there's always someone else. Counselors, principals.

And lastly, communication with your kiddo. They're kids. They're learning all the time. My husband and I call them **sponges** because they're literally absorbing *everything* 24/7. This is probably the hardest part of parenting. Communicating with your kid. Communicating about emotions especially. Teaching them how it's not okay to scream and throw a sippy cup when they want juice instead of water. Not yelling at them when they give you attitude because you told them to pick up their room. Not telling them that they're being bratty for ignoring you when you ask for something nicely 4 or 5 times and they finally do it but with an attitude. It's so so hard. Don't be afraid to apologize and explain why you went off the handle. I've found that apologizing for yelling after I calm down has really made a difference in my relationship with my stepdaughter. My parents never did that. 

And communicating boundaries and keeping up with them is super important with your kid. If you told them ""no TV until after chores"" everyday they'll try to get on the TV before chores. You'll get so tired of telling them, and sometimes you just won't want to say anything to them. Sometimes you'll forget or won't notice they haven't done what you asked and they're on the couch playing the Switch. If you catch them and tell them...once again...they start to realize ""okay I can't get on this because mom told me to do dishes...I'll go do that so I don't have to hear it."" My husband is really bad at keeping up with that. I was gone for two weeks and now I'm having to constantly get on my stepdaughter to do certain things because her dad just let her get away with not doing them. 

Phew...I think that's all I really have to say about it all....omg this got longer than I thought."

breakingmom,fprmkr4,t1_fpqfnss,1588857695.0,I could DM you about the house I grew up in. It's an old farm house that was built in the 1940's. Probably not as interesting as the brothel. Lol but we're completely sure that the owner's spirit was there for a long time and may still be in the barns because my mom got the house blessed back in 2012 after my baby brother was born.

breakingmom,fppi5un,t1_fpp082p,1588802715.0,"Similar thing apparently happened when I was a little kid. My mom told me I would talk about a ""Greg"" and that he was like ""Casper the Friendly Ghost"" but not nice. My mom banned him from our home and when we moved she told him to either stay or go away. He was not welcome to follow us. 

She's gotten every house we lived in after that blessed. I used to think it was a normal thing to do until I told my friends and they thought I was crazy."
breakingmom,fpphmk6,t3_geogqr,1588802433.0,"Omg...I'm not religious, but I've had experiences with ghosts/spirits/what have you... I'd try to get a priest to bless the house. I know with this damn virus it can be hard, but I'd try to just get someone in. I've never tried sage like several people are suggesting. The holy water may help. 

I'd ask your twins if you could ""speak"" to Paul and ask him to leave. That he isn't alive. He needs to move on. But only do this in confidence and maybe with a member of a clergy to help pray for him? Idk my mom's friend had something in her home and that's what they did when a priest wasn't available at the time.

I just hope it's nothing evil...that's always my fear. I've encountered many different things, and have been able to will it away...but evil stays I feel.... I don't think Paul is. Just be careful. Sending you some positive vibes and hope."
breakingmom,fppe344,t3_geiotm,1588800599.0,"Wow, how insensitive. My mom was told it was perverted to feed from the breast by her mother, so she didn't with me. Your body makes it for your baby?? So why not feed your baby with your boob juice?? She did with my other siblings and wishes she did with me. I'd be breastfeeding if I didn't get a kidney injury after my delivery and my body was under so much stress I literally couldn't make anything. I tried after coming home but it was just too mentally draining and physically demanding on my body. 

Plus, second hand toys are the bomb, no matter what type. I love the wooden ones, they're cute and just nostalgic. You're not a wannabe hippie. It's just what you like. Eff her dumb opinions. My mom used to be like that but came around, because if it makes you happy that's all that should matter. I'd just tell her that. ""If it makes me happy why should you be so judgmental.""

AskReddit,fpnpziq,t3_geddif,1588769992.0,"Once back when my husband and I were dating, his friend came into his room, through his window, while we were having sex. 

We were all in highschool still. This was after a half day at school. We all had plans to go to the mall. My husband's friends lived probably about a ten to fifteen minute walk from him. Husband drove us from school, dropped friends off at their house to change. Told them to text or call when they were ready to go or meet at his house. Husband and I went to his house. We're changing out of our school clothes, of course teen hormones lead to sexy time. We're thinking it'll be awhile before the friends text us or call us. 

Thing was friends had texted my husband. They got changed and decided to walk to his house. It was pretty common for them to just walk in the front door, but my husband had accidentally locked it. Soooo...what does my husband's friend do? What he usually does and comes in through my husband's window. Yea. One friend opened the window, we all stopped stared and my husband yelled at him to GTFO. 

Embarrassing but also hilarious. The car ride to the mall was a bit awkward until we started to joke around about it. Needless to say both of them would check the back door first unless they were absolutely sure that no one was in the room getting it."

AskReddit,fpmau5y,t3_gdzb3i,1588729108.0,"For wearing a barrette of a skullanimal (boy that aged me) bat on a bow. Forget that the cheerleaders or other girls could have bows with glitzy crap on them. Mine was just black with a skull bat and the vice principal freaked out. She literally grabbed it out of my hair, because she had told me once that morning that it ""wasn't allowed"". Sent me to iss and wrote me up for ""refusing to abide by dress code"". All because it was...a skull... animal. Nothing in our handbooks said anything about that being against dress code. Several students had jackets with morbid skulls on them and that was fine (I even did...an A7X one). But the cutesy skull bat? Hell nah. 

I told my mom what happened and we looked through the student handbook and scoured the dress code rules (it's the south...there were a lot). My bow fit the acceptable criteria. Many other kids would wear bows bigger than my two inch one. Never got in trouble. 

The vice principal wasn't put on suspension or anything...she just got a slap on the wrist for touching me. She was horrible...The handbook was reviewed and the teachers had to have a in service day to refresh and review the handbooks quarterly. Wasn't the only incident where staff assumed the rules and wrongly punished students. If she hadn't touched me the handbook probably wouldn't have been reviewed and the students would still be discriminated against. My mom don't fuck with teachers who touch her kid for no real reason."

With her we tagged a bunch of people's cars with those window markers. We wrote silly things like, ""I like the smell of my farts"" or we'd draw goofy pictures on the windows. We did it late one Thursday night since our only class was cancelled the next day. I think we did over 100 cars between the four of us (two of our other friends were in it too).

We also planked all over campus and took pictures because three of our other friends were competing with us for who could do the most hilarious one. 

We would ride our bikes around campus and there was this hill that we'd go down on screaming like we were out of control and scare so many people walking by. 

There was a time when we would talk to random people in a weird voice and try to convince them it was our actual voice. 

Our friends ran around campus with water guns and we hunted each other down. There were like twelve of us at one point doing it. 

Our cafeteria had an icecream bar and we'd have ice cream scooping competitions and see who could get theirs the highest. 

That first year was so much fun. I never really did much in highschool out of fear that my parents would get mad. They were kinda strict at that time...(but only with me...my brother got away with so much...I mean wtf dude.)
