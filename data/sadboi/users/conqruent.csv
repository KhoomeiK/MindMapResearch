I know it's really hard and it sounds like you have a lot of anger, but please try to work on forgiving your parents. It isn't easy to raise children, and even the parents with the best of intentions do things to fuck up. It's reasonable and valid to feel the way you do, but until you move past your resentment, you'll never be able to focus on yourself and giving yourself the compassion and encouragement that you deserved in childhood."

It's cool as hell that you still do activities like draw, even if you feel shitty at it. Try to see it as a way of coping instead of something that has to be good or bad.
Everyone's job is important! You have a valuable role in society and I appreciate you continuing to function even though it's hard. 
I know this can be hard to believe, but LOTS of people don't have friends. There is nothing wrong with you, your circle of people is probably just a lot harder to find because they probably have introverted tendencies like you.
Your girlfriend does not see you as a burden, and I'm sure she'd want you to open up so she can better understand you. It can be a struggle but you don't need to feel like you can't talk to anyone"
