*Also have you thought of ride-sharing if you're car is ""new"" enough? Hopefully you live near a decent city. I think you could make way more money camping out near local cities/airports than working at a grocery store."
jobs,exi8vk5,t3_ct0wvq,1566323400.0,"Hmmm try youtube tutorials as well? I've never done admin ass. work, but I'm using any type of youtube training to say I have those skills lol."
jobs,exi8din,t1_exi2lh4,1566323115.0,"and forget retail, have you tried temp companies yet? You can easily be promoted going that route."
jobs,exi88wa,t1_exi2lh4,1566323041.0,"I've removed my college degree when applying to those types of stop-gap jobs; they do think you're overqualified most times. Even if you specifically\* have not had a job EVER, maybe keep any internship experience you've had on it. Make up working at a movie theatre when you were a young teen. It's sad that you have to mock up your resume in these ways, but if it's for these types of gigs... I think it's worth a try."
movies,ewrzagm,t1_ewrykgf,1565716955.0,I think it's coming out on DVD soon and you should watch it. Hopefully you have a fantastic sound system at home... score made all the stakes higher and kept the movie going at a perfect pace. One of the most perfectly suited scores I've seen/heard in a long time!
BipolarReddit,ewryysf,t3_cpnp4q,1565716760.0,"I was so embarrassed. A full grown adult. I think the first time I was around 23, then maybe 25 and now 30ish. Every single time I have to kinda whisper it quickly and look away from my Doc."
BipolarReddit,ewryoyp,t3_cpo6gv,1565716598.0,"haha.... right now it's a 30:70 ratio at this point. People push me away though recently. For  once it's not me, I'm just meeting unavailable people sigh."
BipolarReddit,ewryifn,t1_ewozzb2,1565716488.0,This is my hobby too. I haven't done a thing with it really. Ugh
BipolarReddit,ewryfy0,t1_ewoqqvb,1565716446.0,"Jesus. I envy this! Ever think about donating it all? Reselling on Ebay/Amason? What job are you holding down to make all this money lol? You def. sound more high-functioning and financially solvent than the usual beeper. Whenever you get these urges, you should instead fly away somewhere and relax on a beach."
BipolarReddit,ewry6n7,t1_ewnzkwp,1565716292.0,OH no. Do you feel comfortable explaining why you felt it was cursed? Things happened? Or felt bad juju wearing it?
BipolarReddit,ewry4ra,t1_ewp3bsu,1565716258.0,"That's another weakness I have. Bags. I don't go designer routes. I buy bags and backpacks, overnights too. I have a purse that I love. Bought it 5 years ago and never used! I bought 3 makeup travel pouches in like one week. This past week actually. I do plan on returning. But I have to feel set up you know?"
movies,ewrufkc,t3_cptci8,1565713994.0,"The score was everything. I didn't think DP was even that bad, but the score elevated it to like an 8/10 standalone film. (I think people are just overwhelmed with the magnificence of Avengers IW/EG that they refused to even give this a chance). Anyways when I found out HZ was behind it, it was the best surprise."
BipolarReddit,ewnm1v8,t3_cmyxlp,1565582318.0,"I did this and it ruined my relationship probably permanently. I'm so broken hearted about losing my best friend. He was kind of a childhood sweetheart. He's seen me at my worst, but he didn't quite understand it. But he let me go through with it. He says I broke his heart to this day. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree with your therapist. You didn't get physical and that's really all that matters. Delete the apps and maybe sort out what you need during times of mania. Is it attention? Is it ""strange sex""? Maybe a vacation could help? New scenery to cull that need for temptation you know? And most importantly, what is within you that needs to be healed? The more you heal that, the less you may act out during manic episodes. Maybe you'll be like the rest of us and spend couple hundred on stupid shit instead."
BipolarReddit,ewnlmwy,t3_coz16q,1565581947.0,I think it's a natural reaction to this insane world we've cultivated. Big hugs. I'm right there with you.
muacjdiscussion,epzpeja,t3_bwf7hf,1559670109.0,"I purchased a lot of makeup to get started, but I want to give up before even learning because I don't have (beautiful) blue/green/hazel eyes. I feel like most of the vivid, cut-crease, gradient, etc. eye-looks only look good on people with ""pretty eyes."" Deeply dark brown and hooded ain't it."
muacjdiscussion,epzoihi,t1_epxz3zw,1559669631.0,"omfg...this happened to me too! He was walking in front of my desk too so he wasn't that close. I was so embarrassed he could see them from that far away, but as I grew up mine weren't even that bad compared to some friends of mine. Still having a ""hairy nose"" haunted me. It wasn't even hair as we all learn years later! I got picked on a lot back then. I have no idea what makes boys such bullies at that age only to come back 5-10 years later and be all up in your shit on social media/in person (yeah it happened)."

Mattress,epp011g,t1_epn9o6a,1559359075.0,"omfg. I literally have the money from a settlement, but am going to have to leave my job bc of the pain. I need that money just in case. Is there any other brand you recc 2K LESS that would be the next best thing (or do they do financing before I call and embarrass myself)? After researching a lot here, I know that bed-in-box aren't the best...but that's my budget right now $300-1K with financing options. (I will be saving for this Majestic Bed now though). Thanks so much for sharing this info. It definitely looks like my dream bed when I move out. Yeesh at that price tag, but I get it."
Mattress,epis5w0,t1_epciblq,1559242646.0,"I got a few google results putting in Majestic Beds. Is it this actually Majestic Mattress? [https://www.majestic-mattress.com/product/kensington/](https://www.majestic-mattress.com/product/kensington/)

HBONow,ep7flmm,t3_brukfp,1559081203.0,"Every single time I've paid for HBO it's been cornshit compared to Netflix streaming. Fuck even Hulu is better! Who the fuck is watching Tag right now? Seriously lol. I tried to watch Book of Eli months ago. MONTHS ago. It's taken me to get through it and not because it's a terrible movie. Tried watching Maze Runner (""Movies leaving this month"") same thing. Definitely not purchasing a subscription anymore. Most acclaimed (LOL) content with the worst streaming power ever. Such greed."
