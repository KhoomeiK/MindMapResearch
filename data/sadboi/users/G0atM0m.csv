Advice,f1icgmi,t3_d9akc8,1569508801.0,"Hey hun, I hope all these comments and messages are reaching you. Even if you feel lile no one cares, those who understand that call do.

My last attempt was May 2016. Back then, my purse has been stolen and my ENTIRE life was in it. My phone, my keys to a stupid '02 Ford Taurus, and my wallet with everything down to my SSN card. It was stolen next to a bag with a $2,000 laptop and a bunch of other techie stuff (stated by owner of said bag) in it, but the cops said mine was taken because ""it was small enough to hide under a shirt."" I was renting a room with people who hated living with me, a guy I was seeing never saw past his own hormones and lust. He ended up threatening to choke me out during a very confusing conversation and that's what broke me. I had stopped talking to my family and I was totally alone, he had made me believe he'd be different. With my roommates, I hated that I put myself in a situation that I needed to depend on others and that they hated me for it. I felt like no one needed me and that I had truly become a burden to everyone around me. ""So what's the point?""

When I  broke, I ended up in the ICU for three days, I remember my blood getting drawn every 2 hours and almost having to be put on dialysis. I had a huge ringing in my ears and I felt groggy. But I was so scared; I knew in that moment that I didn't want to die; I just wanted the pain to stop. I didn't want to hurt any more and I thought ending my life would make it stop for good. I pulled through and after a few days in and then a few days out of the hospital recovering, I was okay. Not fully mentally, but I was ALIVE.

I still have times that my brain will resort to ""I want to die"" as an unhealthy coping mechanism. Some days, it's hard to look past. But now I know that I have the power to change my life and how I look at it, even when I felt like I had no control over anything. When i felt ugly, I put some makeup on. Or, if I felt like my hair looked bad, I'd look up some YouTube videos on how to style it differently. Just finding something small that makes you creative rather than harmful really helps, especially since YOU have control over that. So, find something you can really get in to, even if it's just reading or watching a video. Anything to take you out of that negitive mindset. You already did the best thing by reaching out to someone. It makes me wish I had Reddit when I was younger. Shine bright, little one. ‚ù§

All the best,

Your friendly neighborhood Goat Mom."

relationships,ezhxt75,t1_ezhkhkm,1567918248.0,"After dating a liar, I think I can say he said this as a way to make you ""believe"" him. 

He knew he was caught; he felt his guilt and the sins were crawling up his back. But rather than come clean, in an attempt to save face, he makes himself into the ""hero"" of his own story and that this ""common"" thing they have that he knows if he mentions it, you can't say anything to argue. Anything you would have said would have been used to gaslight you. Why? Because he knows you're a decent person who empathized with him in the past, so he can now use that experience to not only manipulate you, but others because people will ""pity"" or ""feel sorry"" for him long enough to let him do what he wants and for you or anyone else to stop asking questions. 

OP, I truly wish the best for you and I hope you can truly move on from this and him; you deserve better."

She really sounds like she has taken the diagnosis hard. Did y'all ever talk about having kids? I know when I was diagnosed, it was like I was told I could never have MY family. As a female who wants children, that diagnosis is heavy. 

Also, do research on PCOS. Trust me. If you can even begin to understand what's she going through, even on a just a basic level, that will help immensely.

But back onto the mental health part of it, maybe talk to her? She's probably depressed on top of everything. Having PCOS messes with you, man. You also need to realize that she knows she's gained weight and she knows y'all aren't having sex, so she probably already started to feel bad about that as well. 

Bottom line though, y'all are married and you need to just be open. Open the conversation, letting her know you'll say things that will/may upset her and that she is free to share her thoughts as well, regardless of your feelings to what she said. If you can't have that conversation, then you shouldn't be married, no offense."

memes,essu7jv,t1_esskso4,1562257760.0,"Hello!

I'm sorry you're feeling that way! Not seeing your friends every day at school can be really sad; you spent the majority of your life with them 5 out of 7 days in a week, so when you don't have that consistency any more it can really bum you out.

Since this is the summer after you graduated (as someone who is now 7 years graduated), I would really recommend taking a trip with your friends. Those memories will last a lifetime and I promise you wouldn't trade them for the world. And, hey, summer is just starting! People can't have everything planned out just yet. üòÑ 

My favorite thing to do was go to the lake with everyone. We'd go to the closest grocery store and load up on ice, food, sunscreen, and drinks then head to the lake. However, there's plenty of things going on for the summer so I'd recommend looking around to see what events you would all like to go to or if you're looking free, a place you'd all like to meet up and hang out. That way, before September rolls around and the friends who are going to college and those who are working still have a chance to see all of you and have fun.

I hope you have a great day. üòä"
memes,esstc9r,t1_esscugz,1562257391.0,"Hey, I'm sorry you're having a tough time at school. I really hope it gets better for you soon and that you can find someone who will acknowledge and listen to you.

As someone who relates to your comment that is now out of school, you won't know most of these people 5 years after you graduate. I know that thought may be kinda scary or even upsetting; however, once you're in the real world you have no limits to the amount of people you'll meet or the friends you'll make. I graduated back in 2012, everyone at my school knew my name (don't know if it was because I was funny or fun to laugh at, but anyway). Now 7 years later, I don't know any of those people. Even my ""best friend"" from 5th grade now has her own life with a kid, we play Snapchat games with each other. That's it. But they also don't know who I am any more; I now have people in my life that encourage me to be myself and love who I am, so I no longer filter myself or hold back like I did back then. Most of these people I hold dear I didn't know 3 years ago, let alone back in 2012. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is even though your friends may seem unattentive, they may have their own things going on, or are just oblivious, one day you will look back and, yes, be a little sad when you think about now. But those experiences will lead you to bigger and better things or people, if you let them. I hope that this message helped a little bit. 

Please have a wonderful day! üòÑ"
