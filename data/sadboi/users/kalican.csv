bettafish,fglc27i,t1_fglbrxx,1580890189.0,Don’t adopt an animal if you can’t afford to properly care for it. Simple as that. Dogs can “survive” in a cage for years without seeing the outdoors if you feed them but yet if you do that animal control will come and take your dog from you. Just because there’s no such laws for fish yet doesn’t mean that you can inflict misery on a living being for your amusement. Betta fish need a 5 gallon minimum tank with proper water PH and plenty of places to hide for them to feel happy and secure. If you can’t afford the $150 set up then buy a pet rock and look at that.
