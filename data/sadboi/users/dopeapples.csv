Existentialism,fp8e66c,t3_gbxv8y,1588390047.0,"Please forgive any mistakes or casualness, I'm sleepy but have thoughts about this, and this post resonates with me. Also, I am not a lurker of this sub, so I am not aware of the practices here, please excuse any offensive behavior. Also sorry long read. 

TDLR: The French stole it from the east, look there for some really juicy and truthy 'existentialism.' 

First of all, imo, Camus sucks. His whole solution to existential dread/nihilism is being 'defiant', 'rebellious', basically stick a middle finger to the empty and silent world and do what you want. Sounds more like teenage angst than truth finding or well-being building. So let's forget about Camus. His use of the story of Sisyphus is the best he's gonna do and he didn't even write it. I think out of those guys, Kierkegaard did a pretty good job. 

""Human beings are defined by their actions, not their circumstances. (i.e. Existence precedes essence.) Life is devoid of inherent meaning, but gains meaning when we decide to prescribe our own personal meaning to it, or to rebel against this meaninglessness by continuing to live on anyway.""

So existence preceding essence doesn't exactly mean humans are defined by actions and not circumstance. To my understanding it means that there is no 'god-given', 'universal' *reason* or *meaning* to a human. You are born an existing human. What your 'essence' is, is up to you, or maybe society, or your circumstances. I'm doing really bad philosophy here but in casual and personal terms to me this premise means that what is really 'real' or true is that you exist, and everything else is a made up human or environment creation. You exist, full stop. Everything else is up for debate on if it is 'inherent'. I agree with this premise if you look at it from one perspective, and I don't from another....but that's up to you to decide. Moving on.

Life is devoid of inherent meaning. This is the meaty part. So first I feel like it's important to really get what this means. I think it's easiest when you think about how you're going to die pretty soon in the grand scheme of things, and your existence is really, really, extremely tiny and inconsequential compared to the existence of the entire universe. And the universe seemingly has nothing to say about this. The universe or god doesn't say Hey, no, the point is to be good! To be kind! To be moral! No, no one is saying that. This is what it means to me for life to be devoid of inherent meaning. What started the universe? Why did it start? **Why do we exist?** No one other than another human being has answered this question, and ofc it is not philosophically sound to just take someone's word for it. 

So there seems to be no 'inherent' 'deep down at the bottom' meaning to anything, to existence. The universe is 'silent' to put it the french way. But I digress. 

I also am completely disillusioned with French existentialism. Know where the real 'existentialism' is? Look in the east. Buddhism, Zen, Daoism, ancient Chinese philosophy, ancient Japanese philosophy, even parts of Hinduism. These are, to me, the real 'existentialist' practices/theory. Now, ***I am nowhere near an expert on this,*** but from my limited knowledge, mindfulness practices and theory take this one thing that we know to be true, existence, and runs with it. French existentialism got that part right (and guess what---there is so much evidence out there that shows they got most of their core ideas from the east in the first place--look it up). Existence is our starting spot, the one thing we are sure of (maybe lol), so it makes sense that in order to learn more about it, we must observe it. 

Sit with existence (mediate). Observe it. Sit and sit and just exist. Isolate this feeling, feel and observe your existence, your body, your body in space, the emotions that come up. This is what is is to be human, to exist, you can observe it and maybe learn from it. Everything else might be made up, a social construct, a survival pattern. But to **exist**, to just exist, is tangible and undeniable (I mean you can think you don't exist but that is a different conversation). 

So yeah, I think if you want to get at that sweet sweet philosophical intuition, that truth, you need to look into eastern theories. 

Many, many, many before us have found through observing existence, through mediating and mindfulness, you encounter something. A current, an energy, a flow, a feeling. Many modern westerners call this Love. Taoists call it chi. And, apparently, the more you mediate, the more you tune into this flow, and the more 'at peace' you feel. The better you feel. The better choices you make. Maybe this 'Love' or chi or something is the meaning of existence we have been looking for. Then again, the concept of 'meaning' really disintegrates when you look into epistemology/metaphysics, and especially when you look into eastern theories. So maybe meaning isn't what we thought it is, and maybe meaning has more to do with language and less to do with existence. Maybe there is no answer to why we exist. Maybe that's the wrong direction to go in. It seems like a good idea to move away from poetic waxing about existence, from thinking about it, to just observing it. Assume nothing except existence, and go from there. 

I say Kierkegaard did a pretty good job because of his 'leap of faith' sentiment that intuitively fits with the surrendering to life many practitioners recommend. Just let go, don't worry so much, don't think to much, just take a leap of faith. This is similar to mindful practices. Quieting your thoughts and just doing. Lay back into the great tapestry that is existence that is chi that is Love, allow your inherent existence to take the lead. 

Idk man, the eastern ways of the meaning of life just seems a lot more truthy to me than French existentialism. More scientific and less emotional and literary. More observation, more focus on learning. The French were a bunch of novelists! lol
