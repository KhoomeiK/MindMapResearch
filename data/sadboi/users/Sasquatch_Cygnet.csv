AskReddit,fitlv17,t3_f9kd1v,1582723780.0,"I was living in shared private accommodation for uni  a couple of years ago. Two guys, three of us girls. I dont really speak to the guys but the girls are lovely.  One night it's just me and one other guy. I'm doing homework in my bedroom in my pjs in bed. There's a knock at the door and I say come in. 

He asks me what I'm doing and I tell him. He sits on the side of the bed and looks through my homework and finds some excuse to brush his hand against me. I shift away slightly. 

Then he lays down across my legs and puts a porno on his phone and his hand down his trousers. I'm shocked and go tense. Tell him with a laugh that he should probably go to his own bedroom if hes going to do that. Please note that I laugh as I say this because primarily, I'm shocked and cant believe this is happening, and I also dont want to upset anybody because I'm a social wreck. 

I push him off me and continue to gently, but seriously repeat. ""You need to go do that somewhere else. I need you to go."" 

He sits up and tells me he needs company because hes lonely and his mum died when he was young. He asked for oral sex.  I tell him that I'm sorry about that but he cant do that in my room and I'm not going to do anything with him as I have  a boyfriend. 

Suddenly his whole demeanor changed. He tensed up and he had this dark expression. He picked up a pair of scissors off of my night stand and started pacing the bedroom while playing with the scissors. 

He did this for a few laps of the bedroom before standing still, staring at me and saying, ""I've never been rejected before. What do I do now?"" Still playing with the scissors.  He stood staring at me and playing with the scissors for what seemed like an eternity. I was sure he was going to rape and stab me. The only way I can describe it was like being trapped in a room with a tiger. 

We started at eachother in silence. I wet the bed. Then his face softened, his shoulders relaxed and he headed for the door, murmuring, ""this never happened"". 

This is the the most scared I have ever been and (touch wood) the worst experience I'll have."

mentalhealth,fg37sdh,t1_fg37iyp,1580473637.0,Definitely! An inability to form relationships may well be contributing to your depression. The best thing is to lay out all of your concerns to psychiatrist and they will help you focus on what is the most important to deal with first.

Could you have had some sort of trauma related to women? Or been affected by someone else's views on women while you were growing up? These are just rhetorical as I'm just a lay person. 

I hope you find some help with this issue because I can only imagine that it interferes with your ability to form relationships with women and everyone deserves to be happy and healthy. 

All the best OP."
