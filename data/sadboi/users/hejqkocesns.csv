I feel like people tend to be patient with me too. I think I might have aspergers and people are still nice enough to me.

I think how the romantic interaction between men and women also work in womens favour with SA. Like it's usually the man looking for a romantic relationship from a woman or pursuing her first. That's how it is traditionally. A woman doesn't need to be confident. Women want a man to be confident though. I think a lot of women wouldn't give a timid/shy/awkward man the time of day.

A woman with SA could find dates off tinder or something easy. If they're just average looking, even if they're awkward/shy on a first date, a lot of men might not mind too much if you tell them.  So many men are desperate/not picky and they don't have high expectations."
