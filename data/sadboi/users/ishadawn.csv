BPD,flktgqu,t3_fp51l3,1585247370.0,I do. For me personally I think that the dissociation that usually helps me cope kicks in overtime when something really horrible happens. I've had numerous times where I've taken over because someone close to me died or attempted to and it's like all the feelings get compartmentalized and the panic and sadness dont get to me. My way of getting  through things is going numb. I dont have control of it it just happens. Like my mind decides that something's aren't safe for my sanity and leaves behind a numb person at a funeral wondering what's wrong with them. Its weird

I knew something was wrong but I was so tired I went home and just went to bed. Luckily I lived with my grandparents so when they checked in on me and found my bed soaked with blood they rushed me  to the hospital. I remember the scary out of control feeling when I passed out. My mother said tons of people came in to work on me. I thought I might die but after all the blood loss I wasn't afraid. Maybe I didn't get how close I was to dying I was. It was surreal
