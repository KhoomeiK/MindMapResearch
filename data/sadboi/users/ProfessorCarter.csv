internetparents,fp3nnrq,t3_gb1w3u,1588282514.0,"Hey, I'm 33F and I've dated my share of guys, had a couple long term boyfriends and lived with two of them. Some guys are lazy and messy and are not likely to change. I've dated a couple guys who were cleaner than me. Most messy guys didn't change. They didn't see the problem with lazy filth, and as they say, ""you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink.""

My wonderful fiancé and I are roughly equally messy, but we have talked about our expectations of each other, pet peeves, and our preferences about how certain tasks are done. We clean the apartment together every few days. We rotate who does which chores based on what we feel like doing. 

There are men who will expect you to do everything. I personally know a lot of them. Their mothers were expected to do everything for them and the guys weren't expected to be a full adult capable of cooking, cleaning, taking care of themselves. And your guy came from a wealthy family, so there's almost no chance he has any history of doing his own housekeeping. 

You BOTH live there, you both wear clothes, you both need to eat, so you both need to make it happen. Let me make it clear that he's not ""helping"" you- these tasks are not your responsibility because you're the woman and he's just helping out. This is HIS work that you've been doing. A partnership is a team and you're both perfectly capable of doing these tasks. 

I'd approach him gently at first. It may be that it never occurred to him that he had to do these things because he's never had to. If he plays dumb or resists, put your foot down. Don't be afraid to walk away. I dated a guy for 1.5 years who couldn't even make mac and cheese. It didn't matter to me that I'd already put so much time into the relationship. I wasn't going to keep throwing my energy into a black hole.

Also, if he wants to be treated like a child, he better not expect to get fucked like an adult."

AskWomen,fooc08u,t3_g8d3f2,1587936308.0,"Met him working together in a crazy hipster bar when we were both 21. We actually remember the first time we saw each other because our connection was instantaneous. He walked across the room and we locked eyes, smiled, then looked away as he kept walking. But we both looked back again at the same time and caught each others' eyes again. Smile. 
Ended up hooking up a few times, but he was more interested than I was. We decided to just be friends after hurting each other's feelings repeatedly. Life went on, a few years passed, we dated other people. 

We both got out of four-year relationships at the same time, but hadn't seen each other in that time. Ended up running into each other at a music festival where he was playing drums and I was attending. We talked long into the night, and made out in my tent. I asked him out a couple days later, really only intending to get a hook up buddy. We started out hooking up, but quickly felt very comfortable with each other since by this point we'd known each other for almost 10 years. We were together from then on.

We're 33 now and have been partners for six years. I'm still very attracted to him. I swear his pheromones literally jump off him and draw me to him. I can't explain it but there's a strong chemical reaction going on when we're around each other. We don't have sex very often, but we're very affectionate. 

I've lived alone for years, and I generally like being alone. I always thought soulmates were made up. I still believe everyone has at least 7 great matches in the world somewhere- it just depends on who you find. I thought I would never find someone I could be around all the time. I'm still wary of marriage, but we think we'll do it someday. We jokingly refer to each other as husband and wife sometimes. We still make sure we get plenty of alone time- they'll never change- but he makes my life happier."

UnsentLetters,fl1uz0v,t3_flwtn3,1584736852.0,"OP, I've dated a man like your husband. He and I were together for 4 years. It took several months before he called me his girlfriend in public, and even then he almost never displayed public affection. Even when we were alone, I'd reach to hold his hand and he'd pull it away. One time I sat on his lap and he pushed me off (not forcefully, but the rejection killed me inside.) He just wasn't an affectionate man. I got tired of being rejected (not what he meant, but that’s how it felt) and we split up. We talked about it several times in our 4 years, and his answer was always that physical affection ""just isn't who he is"". He wasn't changing that. I tried to change- tried to see it as more noble or dignified or mature. But it made me feel small and foolish instead. I had all these feelings just leaking out of me with love, and suppressing them for his sake made me feel worse and more alone. 

Since you’re married, I’d recommend counseling for you both. Maybe then he’ll see it as a real issue & try to address it. 

I’m now with a very affectionate man who asks me to come snuggle, rubs my feet, and tells me he misses me. It’s wonderful. We’ve been together 6 years and I still get excited when his name pops up on my phone.

I had frequent dislocations for ~20 years, then this last times it got stuck and I couldn't put it back in socket by myself. The muscles started seizing and it was excruciating. I had to be driven to the ER and wait for tests and x-rays. It was out of socket for 3.5 hours. Finally they sedated me with ketamine (wild fucking trip) while they put it back in. I wish I'd gotten my shoulder taken care of before that traumatic injury. I can't imagine if I'd been driving or swimming or somewhere alone where I couldn't get help when it happened. It's a liability. I say get it done sooner rather than later.

The surgery only took an hour. The first week after hurt real real bad, I won't lie. It's a long recovery- they're telling me 5-6 months to regain full mobility. But with some weight training, I should be better than ever by this time next year."

I want to protect my staff and guests, but I know most of my staff doesn't have health insurance and it's expensive to go to the doctor. This is the scary thing about this epidemic. Though, in my state of Michigan, many insurance companies have dropped copays for COVID19 testing so it's free. 

I also have an issue with a server who regularly gets overheated when we're busy. She's gotten migraines before, but the overheating & nausea just started a couple months ago. It's frustrating bc it always happens when we're busiest, and I end up having to send her home, leaving us short staffed at peak hours. I'm at my wit's end. Can I tell her she needs to see a doctor to get it checked out, if this is impacting her work? Can I let her go over a medical issue she refuses to treat? It seems like a tricky grey area.

I'm thinking of implementing a limit to call outs, like 3 in one month. I know people have bad luck, and I try to be as understanding as possible. Hell, I've left the restaurant to pick up employees with flat tires or they ran out of gas. But when it becomes frequent, it impacts the business."

I couldn't afford to live like this when I was younger. I wish I could go back and tell my younger self how much better it gets and that I'll never have to deal with roommates again. I sleep in as late or as early as I want.  I stock the fridge with my favorite foods and no one eats them when I'm gone. I smoke my own weed freely in my apartment. 

I also started anxiety therapy and it's doing WONDERS for me, which is not something I ever thought I'd say. (I was skeptical about therapy until my best friend pretty much insisted I go.)

I like being 33. It's all still very exciting and not at all as dull as I thought adulthood would be. I didn't have kids and I'm not married, so my stress is low. I travel and work lots of hours at a job I like. I finally have savings, which makes me feel more steady and secure. I like that feeling and I rarely got it in my 20s. 

It sounds to me like you're going through a depressive episode. I went through one after I severely injured myself. It feels like there's no point. I felt really quiet inside. I wasn't sad, but I kinda gave up. That's why I saw a therapist. I'm glad I had him to talk to and guide me through my thinking. Spoiler: Not everything you think is real. 

My non-professional advice is to indulge yourself for a while. Eat whatever you want, stay in bed for a whole day (not several), feel numb or sad or hopeless. Buy yourself a little something new, especially if it's nonsensical- just something that makes you feel cozy or good in any way. I bought myself a new pillow. I ate a lot of fried chicken and mashed potatoes. Then I talked to someone and got real actual help. I won't need therapy forever, just a little while until I process some things. I think you'll feel better if you sit face to face with a pro."

Restaurant_Managers,fj5nqlq,t3_fbntdf,1583037456.0,"I’m the General Manager. I respond publicly to any valid  online complaints, then follow up with a private message to ask for clarification of an issue, or to get contact info for serious matters. 

I don't respond to complaints about our portion sizes or menu prices. We're an upscale causal restaurant that is well within a reasonable price range (medium size college town; entrees range $11-24) and many of our guests leave with to go boxes with their extra food, so I know our portions are reasonable. 

I answer complaints about takeout our delivery service/packaging, poor service, and anything that isn't just someone being picky. I recently had to do a lot of damage control after a server was caught augmenting credit card tips in the system. (That turned into a police issue!) Three ladies blew up our Facebook with complaints after calling and talking to my assistant manager while I was out, and he didn't make them feel like he was taking it seriously. That's when they blew up FB. Try to nip issues quickly to avoid this! If my asst manager had taken a different tone, they wouldn't have written reviews!

For this super serious issue, I publicly responded thanking them for bringing the issue to our attention and that the GM (me) and the owner had been notified and are investigating. (This gives you time to do due diligence and get the story from your staff's side or look into records to ensure the story is accurate.) I made sure to publicly state that I'd be following up with a private message to get contact info so that we can resolve this matter. 
Then I sent private messages to each guest right away. You don't want to publicly promise something then not follow up. I sent my apologies for the issue, and gave them my cell number to call or text. I only did that because credit card fraud is a HUGE liability and I wanted to speak with them ASAP so I could make sure they felt adequately heard. Most times, a guest just wants to rant to somebody and feel like they're being taken seriously. In this case, they were absolutely right. (They were also very kind about the whole thing.) If the issue were less serious, I'd ask for their phone number so I can contact them the next day and ask what would be a convenient time. 

Valid complaints get a refund. Really bad complaints get a refund and/or a gift card. I try to do gift cards instead of refunds because it gets them to come back and have a different experience to wash away the bad one, then spend more. Plus they feel like they're ""getting"" something with a gift card. Standard card is $25. 

If the complaint strikes me as a money grab, or doesn't warrant a refund (e.g. next day complaint that takeout was cold when they were late picking it up), I make sure they feel heard and I always thank them for bringing it to my attention. I apologize and gush how important it is that management gets feedback. Sometimes I say I'll bring it to the kitchens attention. Then I say ""unfortunately company policy doesn't allow me to..."" if they push for money. This can usually placate them. I NEVER give cash refunds unless it's the same day and I know for a fact they were the ones who paid and I know exactly what happened.

I check our Facebook, Insta, Google business, OpenTable, GrubHub, and UberEats reviews. I only respond to negative reviews that are really bad. If someone says they didn't like their appetizer, or that their entree didn't taste like the one their grandmother used to make in Lebanon (real complaint), I shrug those off. You can't please everyone. But, I don't want a bad reputation for service, health, or security."

- They have a rewards program!

Cons:
- Their joints are lighter but just as expensive as other places. My usual dispensary sells 1 gram joints for $10-15. Lume's joints cost the same but they're only .7 grams. One of the several I purchased burned really unevenly, but the others were okay.
- Overall a bit expensive, but they have sales sometimes.

Worth checking out."

Kale sauteed with a little oil & a splash of water to steam it. Then I add chopped tomatoes and cooked white beans/Great Northern beans. I add a little salt and some seasoning and let it cook for a few minutes till it's simmering and all the flavors have mixed. 
Sometimes I'll do a side of bacon or thick sliced ham for an extra protein boost."

Thoughtful things:
Bring him some fresh socks
Snacks
Magazines or crosswords if it's an extended stay

Good luck!"
