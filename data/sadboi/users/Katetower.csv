I'd use your husband returning as a good ending point of her being there. I'd ask her if there is anything you can do to help her transition out of your place. Tell her a date she absolutely has to move out. Set a firm date you both agree on.  It isn't your responsibility to figure out how she makes her way in life. 

I had a similar thing happen to me when I let a friend move in to my house after her house burning down. I didn't mind helping her get back on her feet  but she really didn't try that hard to get her life back together and move out.. I gave her adequate time, set a date for her to move and it worked out. She got off her butt and looked for a better job and got another place."

Just because that girl is a cunt doesn't mean much. She is one person.  I know you have a different perspective but I can tell what I've experienced. I am going to tell you exactly what my experience has been. I personally have never heard anything that negative about Indians. 

Here is an honest sum total of the stereotype things I've heard said about Indians in my 50 years of life. People don't like the smell when they cook a lot of curry. It is difficulty to understand them sometimes due to accents. The caste systems sucks in India. The only truly negative stereotype I've heard is India is unsanitary.  That is the exact only things I've heard. That is it. That is the only things I've heard. 

Mostly people I've dealt with have no negative views they have expressed to me about Indians. 

I am in the medical field where there are a great number of Indian doctors and they are well respected and even stereotyped positively for being super intelligent. 

The internet is not an accurate picture of what the greater whole of people are thinking. It might seem like it but it will give you a skewed view of reality if you think people irl are all thinking what people say and act like on the internet.

I hope this doesn't make you mad. I am really trying to get you to see another perspective."
