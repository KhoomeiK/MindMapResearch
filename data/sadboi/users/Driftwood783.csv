AnxietyDepression,f7h0vju,t1_f7gqi3n,1573728133.0,"Exactly! Sometimes I wish I could transfer my anxious feelings to a person, if only for a few seconds. Just so they would understand how badly it affects me."
AnxietyDepression,f7frkqn,t1_f7f6w1f,1573685276.0,It's just because of all the anxiety in my head. If I just had some more self confidence then I wouldn't even need all these motivational talks in the first place. I would just work hard regardless of the outcome. But my thinking habits are just wrong because whenever things don't work out for a while then I'm always in doubt and that's the problem. I'm just too counterproductive to get my life to a proper order.
depression,f6uyz3z,t1_f6rtjqt,1573172213.0,Glad I could help :)
AnxietyDepression,f6uyvv7,t3_dt218z,1573172146.0,"Lol this advice might sound very basic but it helps for me.  


I often remind myself to just breathe, and to take things one step at a time, try to find yourself a peaceful & relaxing environment if you can, and just take a few minutes to calm yourself."
bipolar,f6rqtib,t3_dsib3p,1573116237.0,Accurate lol

Perseverance that's what's life is all about. Hang in there brother!"
AnxietyDepression,f34nbu0,t3_dfmwt3,1570656858.0,"Reading this simply made me smile and laugh a bit.. I'm so sorry but you almost sound like me if I were ever to reach an age of 62 and have kids myself. 

The fact that you actually already came such a long way is very remarkable to me. Like it even inspires me in a sense. You're still alive and kicking & trying out new things, you haven't become bitter about it all which is especially hard in our current era. Reading your story already lets me know you're a beautiful soul & you deserve to be loved.

Just don't be to hard on yourself. Life can really throw us off, and it really isn't easy at times. But remember even the darkest nights will end, I'm sure you will find your spark once again. Best of luck :)"
AnxietyDepression,f34jgu1,t1_f330101,1570655361.0,"Thanks for sharing your story. 

And yes I'm highly going to consider my options.   
Seeking out personal help was never really one my strongest sides.  
In the past I just got told to deal with my feelings but they were never really clear about the ""how"" part..

Therefore I think therapy would be a good start for me, I mean I simply don't see how I would last another few years like this.. Things have to change."

I was more aiming to things like poor social skills, shyness & negative attitude etc. Don't get me wrong I think it's great being an introvert as long as you keep yourself in check and realize that your energy levels are limited throughout the day."
AnxietyDepression,f1vsjn3,t1_f18e4vr,1569775264.0,"Thanks for sharing your story and the advice,  I will definitely look into it."

I mean it's never really certain when the storm will pass. All I can say is storms don't last forever..   
Don't think you're life is at an end, it probably hasn't even started yet.  

Stay strong, and I'm sure good things will come your way."

AnxietyDepression,f0drz96,t3_d4fjqe,1568557901.0,"Your brain is probably overactive at night. Try to shut off your phone/screens like 30mins/1hour before you sleep, this might help. Also doing a bit of exercise throughout the day makes falling asleep at night a bit easier. Final tip is try to go to bed & wake up at set times.. This might help your body get into a proper sleep rhythm.  But if all of the above don't seem to work or you just struggle to relax at night, seeing a doctor might help you."

Existentialism,f00hb89,t1_eyx76da,1568301819.0,Thank you for this message. You are a genuinely good person. The post almost made me cry a bit.. It´s just that I get so overwhelmed at times. Life can be such a struggle.. but it´s like nobody ever talks about their difficulties.. Makes me me feel alone a lot. It´s like the negativity always outweighs the positive things in my life. I really try to become a more stable version of myself but I still have such a long way to go..
AnxietyDepression,ey971d3,t3_cvz6fk,1566936671.0,"Boy can I relate so much.. I still remember all those uneased, cringy and anxious moments at school. Feeling like you're never good enough or you belong nowhere.. I wish I could say things get better, nowadays I just look for enough distraction & keep my appearance high like all of that doesn't bother me but it still hurts till this day. 

Just wanted to let you know that you're not alone in this.. Sometimes all it takes is meeting the right person, someone who you can really trust and talk things through with. 

But from the positive perspective you sound like nice person, also good looks really add up to your charisma.  
You shouldn't worry too much about making some friends, you'll be fine. Sometimes all it takes is a little bit of time."

AnxietyDepression,ex1nmwa,t3_cr2aoj,1565950931.0,"Same here, second year in college I feel stressed out, anxious and shackled everyday. I often regret my decisions, but then again hindsight is 20/20.. Sometimes you just got to keep on moving with the cards you've been dealt. 

I mean you can always ask for a new hand, but only if you're willing to sacrifice something for it. 

I don't really know what to say to you, but honestly life is a struggle.. Hang in there bud. In the meantime try to look for something that really inspires you. If you find something that you really like doing then the work that comes with it won't feel like such a heavy burden, but more like manageable tasks. And when you're more able to manage it all then life could become much more worthwhile."

 I really love this part <3.   
*""We are not single beings in this universe. We are fonts of energy and wisdom.""* 

Your words sound very wise, almost as if you've been enlightened yourself. 

It's true that changing yourself begins with changing your environment. Last few years I've read about the process of reaping and sowing. And even though it's not an easy job because the soil on which I'm standing isn't very fertile and doesn't display great signs of growth, I feel like it's time to ditch the old seeds and try to give birth to something new."
Existentialism,ewn54rh,t1_ewmmxrl,1565568809.0,"Please do, I greatly appreciate all input & help towards this topic. 


As for the frequency part, it's difficult to explain but I'll try my best. 

If I were to give an example, it sometimes feels like my brain is working like an overclocked CPU that isn't getting enough cooling. I feel like I'm just experiencing way more thoughts per minute than the average human being, besides that my mind is very chaotic at times, it receives a lot of input & besides that it also creates a lot of input by itself. It's like multiple threads are running at once.. Therefore if I were to be sitting in class I could be thinking about everything else beside the topic at hand.. Because at that moment every thought I experience makes the things that are happening around me seem very insignificant. 

It's not that it makes me any smarter person or anything, it's quite the contrary I find it extremely hard to grasp certain topics as well as reading certain texts. Sometimes I have to read something like 6 times before I actually understood what it said because my mind was never present the 5 times before, it just spaced out. Thinking about other stuff."

Existentialism,ewln7du,t1_ewkmytn,1565530433.0,"Thanks for sharing this podcast.. I felt like it was explaining my current situation very well..

Especially the part that we live in a age where we have endless possibilities to choose from.. And that the awareness of this fact might be very overwhelming (the state of dread).. Because we can only choose so much.

I guess at the end of the day it all depends on how you take things into perspective that kind of define the way you feel inside, and how you deal with it all.."
Existentialism,ewljjyb,t1_ewkvllw,1565526840.0,"I can relate a lot to this..

Especially the part about racing thoughts.. That really struck a chord with me. I myself was a deep thinker from a young age too, I still am. There are days where I feel like I am more inside my head than I am present. This already caused  problems for me at the start of high school. I wasn't doing well at all. Most of the times my head wasn't at the place it should be.. Therefore my grades dropped, until the point where I was doing so bad in school that teachers & parents found that bolder measurements had to be made. In the course of the second year I got diagnosed with mental problems, therefore they put me on all kinds of meds.. I guess the medication was the only reason why I was able to finish high school in the first place, because it kept me present. But pretty much two years after graduating I dropped off all of the meds.. I felt like that stuff was messing with my head way too much, the side effects were terrible as I often experienced nausea and migraine attacks.. I just didn't want to live on like that..

And so in the following years  I've tried to re-establish my thinking patterns & my way of living so that I would be a less chaotic person, and could live on without the necessity of medication.

And even though thinks were working out for a while, it's like I'm falling into my old chaotic & destructive habits again.."
Existentialism,ewlhdyk,t1_ewkn2a2,1565524322.0,"Yeah I'd like to call it ""living on the subconscious level"", and I feel like life would be much more manageable for me if I could just switch back to that.. Bc I hate the fact that I'm stuck in this current thought pattern. But my overactive brain doesn't really wants to give me any slack.."
Existentialism,ewlgpjp,t1_ewkw4rx,1565523458.0,"You have every right to think that way, I mean I'm very sorry to upset you with this.

I know this all might sound like a stupid ramble about reality and everything.. But I just wanted to express the way I feel at times.. I know there are people out there who have it so much worse than me, I don't want you to think that I feel special in any way.. It's just that stuff like this is on my mind constantly and it's making it incredibly hard to live."
AnxietyDepression,ewk04kd,t1_ewajaa4,1565474659.0,"Thank you for your replying to my post, it really means a lot.. 

I’ve highly considered therapy as an option but I’m not sure if it would be of any help.. Because I doubt they would really listen to what I’d had to say.. Besides I’m currently only rolling with a basic insurance bundle and I don’t even think my insurance would cover the costs of therapy.. It's all very unclearly explained on the websites.. And without insurance I just wouldn’t be able to cover all the costs since it’s too expensive..

As for reading books, I will definitely look into that. I’ve heard books can do wonders to you. And It’s true that I don’t really read a lot anymore, so it wouldn’t harm me to read a bit more. 

And well my support system.. As far as friends go, I don’t have a lot of them, and for the ones I do have very few are down to discuss topics like (hardships of life etc. the struggles, problems at work/home etc.) makes me feel like they don’t experience the struggle as much as I do.. Therefore it’s really hard to stir up conversation.. Especially with my younger brother.. We used to be so close.. But nowadays we can never really have a proper conversation anymore.. He’s never home, always away with friends (some of my old friends as well), smoking joints, drinking or going out.. I guess that’s their way of dealing with problems.. 

I felt like that wasn’t going to solve anything for me so I left most of those people.. 

So yeah nowadays I spend most nights just alone by myself, and even though that didn’t used to be such a big problem in the past.. Lately it just feels really empty.."

depression,epk0ing,t1_ephm64b,1559264789.0,"""Life just isn't for everyone, sorry"" This one is very true, it's like you either adapt to the circumstances at hand or you don't..  It's pretty much the same in nature really. There are plenty of birds that die falling unable to clap out their wings when they leave their nest.. Or sheep that fall out of the herd and get eaten alive by the wolves.

It just sucks that humans are aware enough to see these events unfold before they actually take place."
