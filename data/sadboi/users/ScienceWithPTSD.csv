Entrepreneur,foroecg,t1_for0fh3,1588015671.0,"It's ok! Precisely. I want to be taken seriously by the scientific community, even with a label ""health coach"". My long-term dreams are to conduct my own research one day, and I want to pave the road to that. 

Yeah, CBT is a very good example of good branding. It's catchy and honest. 

Your point is strong. I do need to come up with a brand, that is both honest and appealing. A challenge!"
Entrepreneur,foqrg80,t1_foqohmx,1587999470.0,"Using a personal label is lying, whatever you sugar coat it. Wim Hof is doing exactly that. And I do not like that approach! I know it works, but that's the whole problem. Lying breaks the mind, quite literally. I am trying to heal people from lies, not sell them lies. 

I covered the legal part, as I already consulted what I can do and what I can't do. I can't call myself therapist, I can call myself a health coach."
Entrepreneur,foqamed,t1_foq5kdm,1587988549.0,"Thank you. This is a valuable advice. I already covered the legal part. 
I am calling it therapy here, because it is exactly that. And I want to be open about my service. 
Health coach is the hack. This is what I will be calling myself. 

I won't do what Wim Hof does, though. I do not like that. This is stealing.
I will keep transparent about my methods and where I got them. 
Holotropic breathing pre-dates Wim Hof, and it is amazing, I use it in my practice. 

I rely on science, and I do want to market myself as such. 
I am very picky about my clientele, so I really want to attract a very particular kind of customer who do not fall for marketing tricks like that.
I do plan to use subliminals in my videos, so I am not exactly against using marketing props, but lying is something I will not do. 
And Wim Hof is indeed lying, this is not his method, but stolen from the yogis, an ancient kundalini practice. I do it, too, and it helps a lot. For sure."

Hysteria was a word first used by Freud. And he meant it in the meaning of the effect trauma has on the mind and body. Later, the term evolved into ptsd. 

Zoning out a lot is dissociation and a typical symptom. 

Trouble with memory are quite common by dissociations, your mind gets divided and has trouble processing  memories. 

This roller-coaster is also quite common, having high spikes of energy, after that very down moods. Your brain get stuck in fight/flight/freeze/fawn. You can check the 4 fs by Pete Walker. 

We all need help. We are social animals, and this is how we survive,  by helping and supporting each other. This is how the mammal brain is wired, to be a pack, and to care for each member. Sometimes, there are dysfunction in the brain, though. It is very unfortunate, that your parents do not understand this basic law of human nature and fail to support you in your mental health. 

Best of luck!"

mentalhealth,ffqec5w,t3_eujdcj,1580132030.0,"It's not your fault, it's theirs. Childhood neglect is a serious issue. If someone needs to get blamed for it, it is for sure them. Parents are responsible for their children and the fact that they let you alone and unsupervised is a serious mistake. Their mistake, not yours.

And on top of that they are blaming you for their own mistake. This is childhood abuse, as well.

Your therapists is very wise to suggest you seek support online!

Awesome human being!"
therapy,ffpfdlj,t1_ffp6gie,1580093673.0,"Yes, it is a part of the problem, you are very right!

It's like: ""yes, I am know I am mature, but I am 15 and I really want to be 15""

I relate to when someone says ""You are very strong""... Ok, I want to be weak, though. I am very tired of being strong all the time. 

So... quite the pickle we have there, because it is what it is. You are forced to grow up, and it is very heart breaking. 

About deserving. Yeah, you deserve it for sure. The problem is that finding one is very hard, even when you are 18+, not to mention your age. 

About Stockholm Syndrome, it is very confusing. And being aware of it, doesn't automatically solve it either. I am on my guard all the time, and yet I sometimes slip... But every time I get better and better, the progress is not exactly linear, there are up and downs, but you can get out. 

My solution so far is to apply a more humanistic approach. We are all humans and thus animals, all animals have needs that can be used against them. According to Maslow there are survival needs such as need for safety, physiological needs, and growth needs such as love, belonging and self-expression needs. All those needs are important for the long run, though. If you are deprived of those, that can lead to dysfunction in the brain, which can be found now on scans. 

So, Stockholm syndrome seen through that lens, is basically a survival mechanism of the brain, children are unable to survive without grown up's help, so they develop a bond to please their abuser and they start to empathize with them. A compliment feels nice, because it does, it satisfies a certain need. Only to be taken by force later. This extremes in behavior are dangerous. 

So... finding some local support is a very wise decision and reaching here as well. The more you connect the better. Mingle to find allies. There are other people out there, who can understand what you are going through. Maybe, social workers in NGO? Have you thought about that? Or community centers? I really don't know the system that well..."

therapy,ffouvwl,t3_eu928t,1580082046.0,"Seems to me you are very aware of yourself. Keep fighting. It's not easy. 

As someone, who grew up in a toxic household, I understand your struggles. 

I hear you especially about people betraying you and snitching on you to your parents. We live in a society that glorifies parents and cannot accept that they can be very toxic and harmful. 

As to therapy, I am searching myself at the moment, it's not easy finding one. 

As a direction, you can check the sub r/CPTSD and r/raisedbynarcissists They can help you there. Just be wary of Stockholm Syndrome. I am strictly no contact with my ""parents""  now and there are many people, therapists as well, who try to persuade me to get in contact. Abused children are susceptible to Stockholm Syndrome. 

I am no therapist myself, but I am a teacher and I am quite savvy in navigating my mental health, don't hesitate to pm me, if you feel like it.

I am suicidal myself and I did see many therapists. Some of them were one of the causes... Some therapists are just terrible practitioners and sometimes even evil.

I would say, if you trust wholeheartedly your therapist and you have good proof to do that, go ahead.

If you like to talk about how much you trust your therapists, feel free to.

The truth is never ""just"" that simple. Aight?

Just of information, I am in the ""I wanna live""-phase, but the self-destruct button is always lurking in the background.

IWantToLearn,ffi3o84,t3_etq45g,1579964158.0,"Ugh... Quite the pickle. 

Don't get me started on education. Basically, the root of the problem. 

The carrot and stick system has primed us into external motivation locus. 

An alternative approach is the school of Montessori and Maslow. 

Brain re-wiring is hard. My solution is to focus on my current needs with the help of their theory and methods. The idea is a more organic growth, you let yourself immerse in the present moment, with the inner yearning to grow and explore the world free.

This is one of the reasons I chose this path. 
My childhood was a mess, I am that person too, I have been through a lot and the feeling that I am part of the solution and not the problem is quite rewarding. 
Though, to be honest, right now I am not sure how much am I helping, but I know for sure I am on the right path and I am doing a difference. 
Yeah... The wildfires sure came as a big wake up call for us all! 
And your reaction to it is spot on. 
 I wish more people will realize that their everyday struggles and wishes are quite selfish, compared to the bigger picture. 
There are forces bigger than ourselves, and everybody is there thinking they are the center of their pathetic little universe. I feel furious, thinking about those people.

And we pretty much need very basic things, empathy, respect  and care. Those things are so rare. And what you get in return? Best case stonewalling and ignore and worst case abusive treatment.
