zoloft,fr08woa,t1_fr05nhp,1589787409.0,Never even crossed my mind. I just read up on it and a lot of things resonate with me. Fucking hell its like reading about all the deep thoughts about myself that I despise so much I push away deep inside and lock away. Do you maybe know if this is caused by the meds or are the meds just amplifying it?
zoloft,fr08ole,t1_fr03jd6,1589787206.0,"Switching meds sounds terrifying. Tapering off of 100mg, only to go on new meds and go through the miserable first few weeks again. Plus I dont have an appointment with my psych till July and I have a prescription to last me till then :/ might just have to learn how to cope with it"

PenmanshipPorn,ew9jard,t1_ew9ao3l,1565226214.0,"I don’t really know how to answer the question on behalf of the cake owner, but in my opinion it’s probably cause some of the sentences written on the cake are more often said in english and feel more casual (in some parts of the country) rather than having it be written fully in Malay.

Also, how do I go about starting this process? Do I just walk in and ask to see a doctor and consult a general practitioner who hopefully will give a referral to psych? Or do I call and set an appointment first? 

And the appointments, what’s the general setting? Will I be sitting across from the doctor and just explaining my symptoms, or are there questions and verbal tests? And how much time should I be allocating for this? 

Sorry for all the questions. Thanks so much for your response"

orangeisthenewblack,ev5wb4w,t3_cii2m5,1564239525.0,"In her posts/comments she said a lot about how the show hurt her as it didn’t have a fixed schedule and she was basically in the dark for the whole seven seasons (most likely to avoid important storylines getting leaked) and how she couldn’t plan her life around it since she never knew if she was coming back. She also commented (under her post) about how the people who had to leave the show were just taken away from her and how awful they were treated. She also posted about how mean the other cast members were to her (the exceptions being Laura and Jessica). But in most of her posts there are a lot of weird ramblings that seemingly come out of nowhere. Damn, this sucks. Hope she’s doing ok"
