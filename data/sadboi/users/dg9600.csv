AnimalCrossing,flpyfaz,t1_flpwgsa,1585372590.0,That would be awesome if it‚Äôs not a bother! I want a bunch of white ones and I wanna know if I have to buy them like that or customize them! Thank you!
AnimalCrossing,flprntd,t3_fq6his,1585366918.0,Can you customize the lamp posts or do you have to buy them that color?

schizophrenia,fkfxmp6,t1_fkfxjm9,1584144971.0,I don‚Äôt know it hasn‚Äôt changed mine at all since I started taking it... I‚Äôd ask the doctor about it cause idk about all it‚Äôs side effects and stuff.
schizophrenia,fkfwmqd,t3_fi8ait,1584144298.0,"I‚Äôm on it and it helps me a lot, I take it with abilify and I don‚Äôt have any side effects or issues really."
schizophrenia,fkcn0wi,t3_fhphiz,1584056606.0,"Getting diagnosed and on meds is a good first step, and it may take awhile to get back into the groove of things, but you‚Äôre on the right track! It was really hard for me at first too but once I was on good meds for me it all got a lot easier."
schizophrenia,fg7lsmk,t3_excsov,1580595625.0,I knew I had it way before I was diagnosed because I googled the symptoms and I had them all. Nothing else described what was going on. But I didn‚Äôt tell anyone cause I hadn‚Äôt gone to the doctor so I wasn‚Äôt 100% sure. Definitely talk to your doctor about the fact that psychosis sounds like what you‚Äôre going through. Hope you can get help soon!
schizophrenia,fg2ozdr,t3_ewiu3f,1580450390.0,"Make sure he brings his meds, forgetting them for a day or two may be ok for some but for me it makes me flip out. And I‚Äôd say just make sure you check in with him often so he isn‚Äôt overwhelmed. Stake out some quieter areas at the convention or around there like a park of a coffee shop you can head to if he‚Äôs getting overwhelmed.

Also I‚Äôd ask your relative for exact reasons as to why not to travel with him. If he‚Äôs just paranoid he won‚Äôt have anything to say except he‚Äôs a creep or he‚Äôs schizophrenic. If he has real examples then it‚Äôs up to you if you wanna listen or not."
schizophrenia,fenuhfd,t3_eq1suq,1579290962.0,I take abilify and I only had that symptom for a month or so and then it went away. Maybe tell your doctor you‚Äôre going to stop taking it and want a different medication?
schizophrenia,fejhh86,t3_ephlmk,1579174452.0,Honestly you‚Äôve just got to keep trying and looking for a therapist who is right for you. It took me awhile to find one but I‚Äôve been with mine for about a year now and it‚Äôs been going good! It just takes some extra work in our end to get to where we need to be and that sucks but you can do it!
schizophrenia,f9so81e,t3_e6r3od,1575596538.0,As far as I know it‚Äôs just constant. For me it‚Äôs like being at a party all the time that you don‚Äôt wanna be at. Lots of talking and extra noise all the time. It‚Äôs way less on meds but I still have little tidbits most of the time.
kynseedrpg,f7qkr6p,t3_dxe9tl,1573965382.0,"I enjoy both games, but I've had more to do in Littlewood right now than in kynseed. There isn't much to do in Kynseed except buy shops... at least as far as I've gotten. In littlewood you build a whole town and theres much more obvious goals and things to do. It's totally up to you as both games are great, but my vote for now is Littlewood."
schizophrenia,f69u5hs,t3_dqubk9,1572747477.0,Definitely don't pressure yourself to move at your parent's pace! Do what you feel like doing and slowly you'll be able to do more and more. Hope tomorrow is better for you!

MakeNewFriendsHere,f426g95,t1_f424pgn,1571328029.0,I didn't know there was a heathers musical! I love that movie! Are you a movie person? I always feel so behind on movies lmao I haven't seen joker yet or the new spider man movies. I saw Into the Spiderverse though and that was amazing.

schizophrenia,f3t039f,t1_f3szkqh,1571113896.0,Then I don't really know of a good alternative... Maybe you could get a medical weed card and then it would go over okay for work? Sorry but my only advises go with going to the doctor.
schizophrenia,f3szgjy,t1_f3sz1vs,1571113342.0,"I don't know anything exactly, as I'm not a doctor. But I take abilify which can make you sleepy, but I just take it at night. You should really talk to a doctor about the different APs there are out there and figure out what will work best for you!"
schizophrenia,f3syuc6,t3_di2g10,1571112809.0,You should probably go to a psychiatrist and get on anti-psychotics.
schizophrenia,f3swmjz,t1_f3swc0z,1571111056.0,"Also if writing makes you feel better, do a journal type thing real quick if you want where you write everything you're thinking. Sometimes it helps me with spiraling thoughts, and I just throw it away afterwards cause it's always a little wild."
schizophrenia,f3sw7mh,t3_di20zl,1571110756.0,I think you should wake up whoever you trust most and tell them you're freaking out and seeing colors. If you don't want to do that sit with the lights on and try breathing in for four seconds and out for 8 over and over. That's what helps me when I get panicked. Just take things slow and try not to do anything that's gonna stress you out more. Hope you feel better soon!

relationship_advice,f3e0ggg,t3_dgpx4g,1570852811.0,I'd try to talk to her in person and just ask if the guess thing made her mad or if you did something to make her mad. If she says yes just apologize and say you didn't intend to upset her.
relationship_advice,f3e09s0,t3_dgpx8i,1570852622.0,"I would just ask her about why she doesn't seem interested in sex, and tell her that you don't mind it you're just curious. If she comes out and says it then she does but if she says she just isn't ready/doesn't want to be okay with that too."
schizophrenia,f3dla24,t3_dgn6s6,1570839921.0,Maybe you should see if he's willing to go to inpatient care for a bit? Or get him set up to go to therapy or talk to a psychiatrist for meds.
relationship_advice,f3a8bi0,t3_dg99k8,1570764343.0,"Honestly this may be hard, but I'd break up with her anyways. Her health is not your responsibility, she's a grown up who can take care of herself. It's not worth it if you're going to be unhappy."
