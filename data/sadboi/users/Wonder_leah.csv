HistoricalCostuming,fp4jlmh,t1_fp421yt,1588300478.0,I want to give a proper drawstring petticoat a go but in the end I used a small button on this one and Iâ€™ve got some thin twill tape coming that I could maybe use as the tape?
AnimalCrossing,fp1zej1,t3_gausu0,1588251779.0,Ah the shovel I think it just hates all of us XD
HistoricalCostuming,fp1z6t1,t1_fp1yla9,1588251637.0,However the fabric Iâ€™m using seems like it might easily come untied. Iâ€™m tempted to make the waistband shorter and just add a button
HistoricalCostuming,fp1xdbr,t1_fp0x1fu,1588250379.0,Would the ties run through the waistband? The waistband measures around 10 inches total wider than my waist so it seems like Iâ€™m meant to tie that at the back?
HistoricalCostuming,fp1x9tl,t1_fp0vr78,1588250311.0,So should I run the tape to tie it with through the waistband or use the waistbands extra length to tie? Someone else mentioned it coming undone with less grippy fabric and mines quite soft
HistoricalCostuming,fp0mcgl,t3_gamtiu,1588212171.0,"In addition if anyone knows the closure situation for this, that would also be appreciated. Iâ€™m currently assuming the waistband overlaps itself so I can add a button because the waistband is around 10 inches longer than my wait currently."

sewing,fozt57w,t1_fozsnxa,1588196408.0,Thank you all this is super helpful!! Now Iâ€™ve just gotta stop this guy making spiderwebs/birds nests underneath the fabric! Iâ€™ll probably buy a separate bobbin winder since the one in my machine had half of it snapped off so now doesnâ€™t hold the bobbin securely when winding

sewing,fozr1as,t1_fozq5fa,1588195364.0,I did try adjusting the tension either way while sewing (I was just sewing on the edge before washing) and it didnâ€™t seem to help or change mych
sewing,fozqevi,t1_fozq5fa,1588195053.0,My top tension is on 4 and I have no idea if I can adjust the bobbin tension. Could it be cause the bobbin winders a bit broken on my machine so it might not wind with even tension?

HistoricalCostuming,fot3eot,t1_fon42z8,1588043761.0,One last pick at the depths of your historical costuming knowledge? What material would you recommend for the petticoat worn underneath?

piercing,fm68hgd,t1_fm67zmt,1585788533.0,I had them pierced with titanium rings originally but had them changed to labrets as they hadnâ€™t healed after a year and a half. The piercer that changed them suggested plastic to eliminate any irritation caused by the metal? Do you think I should do the same as you then? Lockdown seems like the perfect time to take them out to heal as I can keep an eye on them easily?
piercing,fm688rq,t1_fm67w14,1585788386.0,They are not perpendicular to the skin they are maybe 10 to 20 degrees off perpendicular. I had them pieced with rings that I got changed to labrets and the piercer that changed them to the labrets suggest plastic to eliminate the chance of any allergic reactions? Should I take them out then and get them repierced?
piercing,fm66bh9,t3_ftbs1y,1585787214.0,Iâ€™d go to a piercer and get them to change it for you! Thatâ€™s what I did with mine and it barely hurt at all and they only charged like Â£8 for the jewellery and the fitting!
piercing,fm63i00,t3_ftboch,1585785500.0,(Continued) Iâ€™m beginning to think itâ€™s due to the angle of the piercings which is demonstrated by the red lines? Should I just take them out then get them re-pierced once they heal?
