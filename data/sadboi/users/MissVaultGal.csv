adhd_anxiety,fpk0gdl,t3_gdlyu9,1588685429.0,"I feel the same. :( I still work 5 days a week as well. Also, I feel stressed out even when I play Animal Crossing too. I've been playing the game since the GameCube days so I'm not sure what's happening. I'm starting to lose my mind over all this anxiety. Feels like a downward spiral is coming."
adhd_anxiety,fo7156v,t3_g5nwpw,1587570410.0,"I feel like you described me 100%. I used to be a musician too and would write and compose but I can't do anything anymore. Lots of people keep saying medication helps but my doctor wont prescribe me stimulants. Its agonizing.

I believe in you and know that there's always something good there, always something special. It just takes a certain environment and structure to let it come to the surface...I have been trying mindfulness but it doesn't help with getting things done--it helps with regulating my emotions but most of my negative emotions come from not being able to just DO things like everybody else. I freeze up. I'm actually going to quit my jobs to focus on finding a better environment that suits me. Maybe you could try finding a creative job, or just something that has to do with music? That's what I'm going to look for, in hopes that it will be less draining. You've got the experience, so go for it!

I personally think motivation is the key, but it feels nearly impossible for people like us to motivate ourselves. And as we get older there's no one around to cheer us on or make us feel like we're worth anything. As for the album, that is fucking amazing and you should be really proud of yourself. To get it out there, share it around! Social media sucks but to be honest it's so good for sharing ideas, and the people who know you work on music are always eager to hear anything that comes from you. I hope in time more people will hear your wonderful creations!

You haven't failed at life--the way our society is, the soul-crushing ideals and unbearable pressure it creates has failed you. I think as creatives, we have to have the courage to break those ideals and not give in to the pressure we feel. Maybe in getting past that barrier (and our own barrier that executive dysfunction causes) we'll be able to live a happy and fulfilling life. We all should have different lifestyles anyway, we're all different people. It's okay if you need something different! Keep on fighting. Asking for help is not easy, and fumbling through all the options to help yourself is even harder. It's so hard to find something that works but I believe it will come. Good luck ‚ù§"

The only time I really have to go have fun is after work late at night. I love to hook up with people because I enjoy the many different types of people out there, and it's a lot of fun to spend time with someone cute and new for a night. I usually see them again, I rarely have one-night stands. It makes me feel free, and I don't have time for commitment anyways and I'm definitely not ready. I have a lot of things to work on still and having casual relations helps me improve myself. :)

Edit: I am 21(F). I had the exact same thoughts as you when I was 18. I have definitely changed a lot since that age! So who knows, maybe you'll answer your own question in time?"

bipolar,f5ye7ms,t1_f5xk2f0,1572554816.0,"Speaking from personal experience, do not smoke or drink to manage your stress :( you'll eventually get to a level where you have to drink or smoke a certain (high) amount just to feel better. Your tolerance will build without you even realizing it. Smoking and drinking too much will affect your mannerisms without you realizing it as well. In the moment, it seems like it helps your stress but the more you do it, the worse your mood will be. Your mood will be unpredictable and there will be times you don't have access to a cigarette, weed, or alcohol, and you'll become an absolute asshole. 

Most importantly, you think you have control over your moods by using substances to level you out, but you don't. The substances have all control over you. I'm glad you realized you needed to take a step back! It's not worth it."
