I believe most nations will find a way to bridge the cognitive dissonance necessary for functioning through a collective trauma once it is over. Most nations will have days, rituals, tv specials addressing the timeline, the people, names and faces, vigils, statues, etc. I am not American, but I don't see why they won't also mourn in the future."

Then when Jesus was a baby, King Herod got antsy about a prophecy about a baby King of great power or whatever, so he starts killing every boy under two.
