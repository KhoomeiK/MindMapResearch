SuicideWatch,fn6bfug,t3_fztrhg,1586694425.0,"Depression isn't a weakness. Managing with and surviving in spite of it is actually a Herculean feat.

I would suggest a few things:

**Therapy and Medication first and foremost**

Seeing doctors and tackling the symptoms of the depression you experience should help create a divide between who you are and what the depression is. (For me, I thought I was lazy, but now I know symptoms that I experience are fatigue and lethargy, combine those with disinterest in things? See why I thought I was lazy for so long? But it was just symptoms of the depression)

Be forewarned, trying to find a therapist and a medication regiment can feel really disheartening at first, especially when you don't start feeling better straight away. Most medications take 6 weeks to start working, and therapists? Well, just remember, therapy is a relationship, and if you don't trust, respect, believe in, or feel comfortable around the therapist, it's okay to try a new one. Their feelings won't be hurt if you're not vibing and ask to see someone different. This is about you!

**The second thing I really reccommend, and if you're stubborn like me, perhaps try this first is PEER SUPPORT.**

Find a support group for people living with depression, a support group for single parents, a support group for survivors of abuse...any space where you can know you can show up and be honest no matter how you are feeling. A place where there are people who have gone through or who are going through similar struggles.

It can be super scary walking into a room full of people you don't know, but think of it this way, you live with depression everyday...it may be familiar, but it is much more frightening than a few self-selecting, also vulnerable strangers.


**Lastly, just keep fucking fighting.**


With a Mom so open in her management of and honesty about facing mental health challenges, your 4 yo will grow up with absolutely no stigma attached to mental health facets. They'll be able to, if the time ever comes, to ask for their own help without second thought, without any shame, doubt, or feeling weak.


You have nothing to be ashamed of. You are a strong, powerful survivor. You are going to get through this, and you are going to be okay. Just keep fucking fighting!"
SuicideWatch,fn69kl2,t3_fzu0jt,1586692623.0,"For some people with mental health struggles it can feel like they've been walking alone their whole lives, keeping secrets about what they're experiencing, while the mental health facet feeds them lies about who they are and what they do or do not deserve.

When a struggling person isolates, holds onto the secrets and believes in the lies for so long they become the lies, it can feel like they've reached a dead end.

But just over the guard rail, past the dead end sign, through the thick, dark woods is a neighborhood of people who are experiencing similar obstacles, and those people have no one to talk to, they have nowhere to turn.

It isn't until the person who has reached the ""dead end"" but hasn't given up, the person who sees the guard rail but steps over it and pushes forward into the vulnerable, and the unknown, the uncharted and the uncomfortable, that those future, alone and tormented others, can find a friendly ear, an understanding face, a friend in the trenches.

The dead end is an illusion the illness wants you to believe. Push past this moment, get more vulnerable and ask for more help. There are people out there who can help. And someday, when you make it through the dark woods, you'll be the one to help others who are staring at their own imagined dead ends.

And you can tell them, what I am telling you now. Your pain and your torment is molding you into someone who will be an expert helping others through in a way someone who has never hurt like this before will ever be able to.

Putting yourself out there, I think, when those who care about you use it as a blanket statment means ""Let potential mates see you and experience you the way I see you and experience you."" 

""Put yourself out there"" is a huge compliment, because the person saying it is pretty much insinuating that you are a catch, that there is nothing about yourself worth changing or working on, and that you are ripe for the picking.

So, that aside, who are you that's so great? What are the things that make you shine so brightly to those who tell you to ""put yourself out there?"" 

Maybe make a list if you're a list person. If you feel silly doing this, trust, millions of people do much sillier things than self-analyze in order to find love and share a relationship and their life with someone compatible and deserving.

If you are having trouble looking at yourself through this lens, ask those you trust what they think you have to offer. Then looking at the list, trusting the list and feeling confident in those attributes, and ultimately in yourself.

When it comes down to it, putting yourself out there means being confident in who you are. Pursuing the things you like to do, and exercising joy when you do them. 

Standing with your shoulders back, chest out, making casual, prolonged eye contact (see, not creepy) while smiling (also see, not creepy). 

Asking others about themselves, really listening to the response, and following up at a later date with reference to last meeting/conversation - try it with the cashier at your grocery, or your barista, or someone at work who you normally don't communicate with on a daily or weekly basis.

Putting yourself out there also means GETTING VULNERABLE (my least favorite thing to do). For you, maybe finding a bar you do like, and making it a special event or date place...I would suggest a speakeasy/cocktail lounge vibe. 

Maybe also try therapy. You gotta date yourself before you can date anyone else. Can I get an ""Amen?""

Sometimes, the thought and timing made me laugh.  Sometimes because of the irony and sometimes out of desperation.

What I learned, after years of this ""mantra,"" was that if everything was, in fact, meaningless, I could do whatever the fuck I wanted to do. No matter how much I hated myself (meaningless), no matter how ashamed being vulnerable felt (meaningless), and no matter how much other people judged me (meaningless) (also see, no one could ever judge me as hard as I judged myself).

I also learned, in hindsight, that the ""mantra"" wasn't mine. It was the depression's. And the depression wasn't mine either. It was something I had to learn to manage, and it was something I shared with 20% of the world's population.

The depression wants to keep you pressed down beneath its gray mass, but tease it apart  est you can, identify the specific symptoms you are experiencing and come up with one concrete way ( however big or small) you can combat that symptom with.

Similarly, do not look at you life as an absolute mess, rather, dissect it into the specific sections you want to improve, and create goals in each section...try breaking it down like this:

Physically
Mentally
Emotionally
Spiritually 
Socially
Occupationally
Financially
Creatively
Intellectually

Breaking apart the big things make them much more manageable.

Anyway, are you rigid in staying where you are? Maybe ut's time to spin the globe and drop your finger or down? I mean, if you don't kjow anyone where you currently are, what's stopping you from leaving and starting somewhere new?

You could probably get a postman job in a lot of places"
SuicideWatch,fe9we6p,t1_fe84jl0,1578942040.0,"While i was a very good liar for a long time, the ""I'm fine""s and ""Everything's great""s, i pushed a lot of really wonderful people away. During my liar years, I thought I had really great friends - but once I began asking for help, opening up truthfully, and getting vulnerable, I realized I had painted myself into a corner.

All my great friends couldn't handle the information I was supplying them with how could I go from 100 to 0 in a week or two?

The depression wants you lying, the depression wants you isolated. The depression wants you thinking that the people you pushed away want nothing to do with you anymore, but these are all lies the depression uses to keep us under its ruling finger.

I suggest reaching out to someone you haven't spoken with in awhile, just to touch base, and, if you're feeling courageous, apologize for the distance you feel you created. Blame the depression. You are allowed.

Say that you are trying ro get connected to the people and things that mean something to you.

Every time I have done this, I am fascinated to get a really kind response, and an update about what my long lost friend has been going through.

It may seem like you are too far gone, but tou might just be the person they need reaching out to them right now.

And that sir, will feel so purposeful."

What a useless piece of advice.

My Dad once said to me, ""just snap out of it."" 

I replied, ""if it were that simple don't you think i would have done that YEARS AGO?""

Some people, regardless of how much well-meaning they have, are actually so ill-equipped to be there for someone who is suicidally struggling it is laughable for the person struggling.

I hope you're able to laugh at this woman's advice.

Also, this is a great example as to how people with lived mental health experience should be the ones in positions to help those currently struggling.

Reach out whenever. Hugs and high fives💜"

Please be a little gentle with yourself, emphasize that bright-burning resilience you've got there! I am in awe.

Having the knowledge and experience that you have, while painful and excruciating, haunting and absolutely vile, it'll make you the perfect person to help other warriors who are trying to fight their way through it. 

(And helping others by validating their experiences by sharing your experiences, will also help to heal you.)

Please find resources in your area so you can go and talk to someone (who will most likely be someone else with lived experience), and ask them for help, and accept their help. You are worth more than the life you've this far suffered through.

You deserve love. You deserve safety. You deserve contentedness.

I'm telling you! There are future warriors who are going to need your help, but you have got to get some help for yourself first.

No shame, just absolute guts and courage, strength and resilience. I am rooting for you! I know you can do it."

When you can't take it one day at a time, you take it one hour at a time.

When you can't take it one hour at a time, take it one minute at a time.
