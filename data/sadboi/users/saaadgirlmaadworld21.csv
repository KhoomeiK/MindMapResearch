bipolar,exuxjqt,t1_exuwaix,1566589604.0,Hmm... A big symptom of bipolar is decreased need for sleep. It's like your permanently caffeinated. But I'm not sure everyone experiences that. I also experienced psychosis and paranoia. Maybe you have chronic depression. A psychiatrist would have all the answers for you
bipolar,exuum5e,t1_exut7mh,1566588557.0,Do you have long periods of sleepless nights when you're feeling on top of the world? A big reason why I started medication was because I was awake for weeks during manic episodes
