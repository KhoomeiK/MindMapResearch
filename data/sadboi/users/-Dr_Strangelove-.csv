If you leave them to their own devices then it can be a problem. But ask yourself this: after talking to a typical teenager, do you REALLY want that to be the person your child socializes with? Not me. 
As a parent OTHER parents are terrifying. 
They could be leftist commies or Trump voters. They could be carnivores or vegans. Or drug addicts or super religious crazies......
You never know who these people are , or what kind of kids they are raising. 

I talk to my kids a lot! And I do t particularly censor myself. Obviously nothing xxx but I watch the news with them and we bitch about trump and we bitch about pelosi and her obvious drinking problem. We talk about Iran and our history with them. I bring up maps and articles, we watch a few documentaries and we discuss.  My 6 year old could give you a run down on us/Irani politics that would make a cia analyst blush. 

I REALLY want my kids to be strong thinkers with powerful minds. I don’t see those traits coming from kids today, maybe some but not enough. 

My kids probably are a bit weird. Truth. But that’s because their minds haven’t been molded by what’s “cool or lame” by the kids at school.  My daughter thinks wearing different color socks is the coolest fashion statement known to mankind.  So we all wear different colored socks that SHE picks out each morning. I’m In the finance world and everyday I roll up to my trade desk with pink/brown, black/white, blue/gold or what ever the little lady deemed cool.  If she was in school some little asshole would have made fun of her and ruined the fun or her being creative and quirky.  Fuck that.  And if having them be homeschooled provides even a SINGLE additional special moment like that with my kids at the cost of them being “awkward” in the eyes of some “typically unique” kid..... I’m fine with that. My kids are little bad assess with quick wit and sharp minds.   

I am a huge proponent of homeschooling. But it takes work. Can’t just throw a few work books at them and expect them to learn and be ok.  They gotta be your wingman through lots of stuff. Take them to work, to the dmv, to your cpas office at taxtime.  Volunteer at soup Kitchens on holiday, make sure they say “ma’am and sir” to EVERYONE, especially those in low wage “crappy” jobs. The 45 year old Mcdonalds lady’s need the respect more than some ceo and it teaches your kids humility and courtesy.
Make sure they hold doors for the person behind them and say bless you when someone sneezes. Teach them to get an extra burger for the homeless man in the corner.    

Those little lessons that they can pick up from you as you go about your day will serve them better than socializing with a bunch of entitled kids at school. At least that’s my opinion."
AskReddit,fe5u7ou,t3_enw1hw,1578875044.0,"Pro: your kids will grow up into independent thinkers that don’t constantly seek approval from their peers. You guide what they learn and how they learn it.

I definitely agree that detainees are being kept far too long. Either let them in or send them home. But it shouldnt be taking so long. I have a relative that works at  BP detention center as a doctor and that They get into a never ending bureaucratic paper chase and they end up locked in there for months when it should take days. 

 As for their health, after that harsh journey I’m surprised it’s not a lot more people dying and not because of the treatment. I live in southern Arizona and it’s CRAZY CRAZY hot outside 9 months a year and there is ZERO shade.  Some of them are in deaths door when they arrive, and some are very old or very young.

Parenting,f9919it,t3_e47q9k,1575185665.0,"I completely understand your excitement! We have two young kids 1&5. She was a trooper and did the stay at home thing while I went to university and studied my ass off. I get a great job, but they sell the entire dept 8 months later.


We were super lucky that I got wife a job at the same firm I worked at but in a different dept. I took a few months to hand out with my kids and be a stay at home dad, which was amazing. Unfortunately we had to make it on one salary in a very expensive city so it’s been bert very tight money wise. Until now.


I just got a TERRIFIC job that I love. I make money at as well. Between the two of us we will make around 110k I in 2020. We both come from terrible backgrounds that were very poor. We have been together for 13 years and the most we have ever made combined in 45k a year. So this is huge for us. 


We landed free daycare which means 58% of our income will be left over at the end of each month. We can pay off our credit cards in less than a year. Get her teeth fixed. And finally get to hold my daughters hand as we walk through DisneyLand eating $14 cotton candy, and do so without having to worry. 
We won’t be rich compared to some, but for us this is like being millionaires. 


Op I am so happy for you! It feels so nice to have that wonderful feeling of achievement."

AmItheAsshole,f93httr,t3_e3f7tf,1575059423.0,"NAH. I see a young lady that is seeing a new woman “play house” with her father on a major family. Not that it makes it right, but that’s how she is feeling. Thanksgiving is a holiday that is probably heavily connected to her mother (assuming ofc) and it hurt her to see you get over it before she has.  


Same thing happened to me the first time my mom went on a date after my parents split.  I threw a brick through his back window when he dropped her off.  


Kids in mourning do wild things.  Stop being silly and call her up and be real.  I get you want to protect your new gf, but if you take the side of a new woman so quickly your daughter will feel very very hurt.   


Would you have pulled her tuition if she called her mother fat? No!  Maybe grounding, but you’re not pulling her college funding.   


You’re being MORE protective over this new lady than you would be over their own mother.  You have to see how that would just hurt terribly.  

You’re 56 and 43. I’m sure you guys can find a way to maturely dream with two hurt little girls without going nuclear."

 That being said, I don’t think they are being malicious. They are probably being overly helpful,  but in non helpful ways. If they are aware of her multiple diagnosis they might just be worried about her ability to cope which seems well founded. 
 She is going to have to figure out a way to cope with parental suggestions, critique and out right rudeness. If she stays this sensitive its going to be a very very long life.  Just try to keep in mind that she is admittedly mentally unsound and might not have the best frame of mind when it comes to deciding who is behaving correctly or not.  Don’t ban your family lightly based on things that might just be a manifestation of her illness. 

Best wishes and congrats on the baby!"

The little kid stuff I get. I have a 2 year old and a 5 year old. All I want is for them to stay my little babies for ever. They are great kids, but those moments where your children are cute and sweet and loving and not angry are so few that we tend to hold on to them a bit too tightly at times.  
Go easy on the folks over that one they just love you, more than you’ll understand until you have your own kids."
