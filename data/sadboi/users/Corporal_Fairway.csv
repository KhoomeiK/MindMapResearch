>I can play ANF over and over again and I dont know why.

Exact same thing here. Iit's just the most replayable and easiest-to-jump-into season for me. I find myself going back to it the most. It's probably due to it's shorter length, it's new cast so it's almost like starting on a clean slate, along with it being very action packed.

It could have been much better, that's a given fact. The original story actually sounded really cool but it was scrapped for ""not feeling like TWD"" according to one of the devs, I think. But for it's troubled development and limited budget, I think it turned out pretty damn well. ^Plus ^Eleanor ^is ^bae"
