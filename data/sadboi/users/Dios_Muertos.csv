schizophrenia,fqj5j9k,t1_fqhmpmu,1589405334.0,"I've actually had similar experiences, full on conversations with people on the tv and my mind still tries to find it till this day but i am able to shut it down.

Commiting suicide is an option you didn't commit suicide you took a drug insted you shouldn't feel bad for something you didn't do!
My psychosis told me that i hurt people close to me but then i learned that was one of my biggest fears not something i did.

Our minds are so powerful they project all of reality that we perceive imagine if your brain flicked one wrong switch and got messed up then in short your brain gets re-wired wrong then after awhile this is your reality now.
You also have to think that your brain allows you to get up and experience  life think about how easy it would be to get something wrong with it and mess up your perception.

I don't want to push ideas onto you but he might not exist moral of this: live your life
God may exist: live your life.

People get worried about all this but first just live your life it's all you may have so live it well be a good person out of choice not by what ""God"" said.

That's fair man understand completely! The LSD wasn't poisoned its a very powerful (one of the most) mind altering drugs and if we think about mind altering drugs imagine if it just never stopped this is a result of psychosis

Dude you have a whole life ahead of you don't worry about that untill later it's not worth the worry!

Just have a few questions!

How long have you had this for?

Are you on medication?

Does your family know?"
schizophrenia,fqhgz6u,t1_fqfitla,1589376793.0,"Sorry to hear that. 

Do you think it's convenient that you took something to make you hallucinate then developed hallucinations?

Here's a snippet of something on LSD overdosing ""With the average dose of LSD ranging between 40 to 500 micrograms (μg), overdose effects have been recorded at doses from 1,000 to 7,000 micrograms. Even the strongest users are unlikely to come in contact with such an amount of LSD"" 

""You may not die but you could overdose, experiencing such things as panic attacks, severe depression, seizures and erratic behavior.""

And this is explaining as overdosing not as in passing away that would take a lot more. Say for an example 5000 micrograms may be up to 50 tabs at once. 

In conclusion ""No reports have indicated that taking too much LSD can cause death""

If God exists there wouldn't be a alternate universe without him because he created everything.

A lot of people have theorys that this is also a vivid dream but we cannot know life  before passing through it ourselves. If this is a dream make it a good one while it lasts.

People could say Earth is a precursor to Hell just like it is to Heaven. Just because you didn't believe before means you will be condemned. Maybe this is your test to prove your worth.

Don't feel terrible they're still there aren't they? The only thing that has changed is your perception of them. They are still there.

Or is it Convenient to call it that because of how real everything feels.

Have you thought to question your own questioning? 

Insetad of jumping to conclusions. Did you think that you might not of passed away? 

I know it's hard to question things that seem like reality but on the other hand it could be a delusion. 

It's better to be confused, than stubborn with the wrong answer.

Hope any of that may have helped and just a disclaimer I'm a sceptic when it comes to god I don't know if he exists i just thought it might make more sense if i wrote like that so you could relate."

I've been using Lions mane come off taking Klonapin every week and also alcohol, normally start getting my psychosis more volitile after a week as to why i took a benzo. Started meditating also which has improved my headspace (You can do guided if hallucinations are too much) it has also reduced and almost cut my chest pains that are a result of my anxiety. Mindfulness meditation has also helped me through the past 5 years and have put me on a path to getting better. Excercise is also another huge benifit. Everyday is a step forward."
