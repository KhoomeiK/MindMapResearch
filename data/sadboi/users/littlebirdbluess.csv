Anxiety,fpel4ld,t3_gcs8l3,1588549651.0,"Story. Of. My. Life. Meds won't help with these thoughts, meds just help keep an okay level of anxiety to keep you functional. Therapy will help these thoughts. Finding where they stem from, what conditioned you to feel this way, and learning new behaviours to replace these. 

I frequently remind myself that I am not in control of the universe. Trying to prepare for something I can neither control nor predict is futile and just makes my life harder. Lol this doesn't like, stop those thoughts in their tracks and I am by no means cured from this, but it helps and, with guidance from my therapist, over time I will be able to replace the panic preparedness with a quick acknowledgement of the feeling and then presence in my present. It's hard work and takes a lot of effort, but dealing with anxiety means changing anxious behaviours. 

You are not alone! This is not weird. You are not odd. You can change the behaviour."
family,fpaw3l5,t3_gccres,1588456926.0,"This sounds like my family. I've been here. This may not be what you want to hear , but you cannot change your mom. You cannot change her behaviour. You cannot control how she behaves. 

You CAN be a positive role model for your sister. Research shows that even the most terrible trauma can be offset by a positive older figure. That's you. You can't make your mom stop yelling at her, but you can swoop in when it's over and do something fun or relaxing or just give her hug and tell her you're free if she needs you. When you move out, you can still be helpful by texting her and visiting when you can. 

DO NOT stay there because you feel guilty about leaving your sister. I know it sounds harsh but it is okay to put your needs first. You know what would hinder you being a positive helper for sister? You staying in that house and suffering from your own mental health issues. You cannot help others if you have nothing for yourself. 

Continue with your life and your plans and be there for sister through texts, mail packages, phone calls, visits, anything that brings a little joy. One day she'll grow up and leave, too, she won't be trapped there forever. 

With all this said, please so not mistake my advice as saying that's it's your job to bring happiness to sister. It's not.  You are just in a situation where you can help offset this terrible relationship she has with your mother a bit by bringing her some positivity and support when you can. 

I'm so serious, feel free to reach out if you need to vent. Seeing a situation that you have no control over is one of the hardest things in the world and it's even harder when you're alone. I'll say that now, at 28, I'm in therapy for reasons similar to this and one day you'll be on your own and will be able to get your own therapy and I highly recommend it. The only person you can help is you and by doing that, you can share a little help to your sister."
AskParents,fp9uxks,t3_gc8an6,1588435079.0,"First, you did the right thing for that family. Clearly the message was hears if you guys are seeing a reduction of these instances. So, go you. 

Unfortunately I don't believe there is any way to smooth the waters. Just keep riding it out, stay kind, and wait for her to come around.  Actively trying to clear your name will just make it worse and help her solidify her thought that it was you. 

It sucks to have your neighbor so pissed at you, that must be stressful and make living there just a liiiiiittle worse. Take solace in knowing that you helped that child and, in a way, that mom."

CancerFamilySupport,fnjopvo,t3_g222of,1587003503.0,"I'm so sorry this is happening, that's an actual nightmare. In times like this, I find it helpful to connect with someone through a phone call and try to get a bit better grasp on your world. Right now all you can think about is her and what the next few days will be like and the next few years if worst case happens and that's natural, but those thoughts are heavy and can drown you. Find a friend to call and recenter. **Sending hugs**"

There's absolutely a risk, but you've been quarantined and I assume they have been quarantined so the risk comes from everyone you will encounter along the way. Consider driving and using gloves at gas stations and wearing masks when you stop to eat and, I don't know, maybe even sleep in your car instead of a hotel.

Parenting,fl55kkt,t3_fmhmh9,1584828992.0,"There's no avoiding it but you can lessen the severity a bit by choosing your words carefully when telling them not to do something.

I'm telling myself that the people who are seriously ill and dying know they are seriously ill. There's no wondering if they are experiencing anxiety, they know they need help. I trust that I will also be able to determine when I need help."
AskParents,fl49dnd,t3_fmg2tg,1584808762.0,"This is happening a bit here in TX. It sucks, but this way you may have a daycare to even go back to after this.

One thing you could talk to them is sending activity ideas and projects to you via email on a weekly basis. If you're going to pay them, I think it's reasonable that they provide something to help you, too."

raisingkids,fkxeq58,t3_fl93wh,1584626496.0,"A parent could give them something weird to draw and then they draw and show each other and talk about what they made. 

They could play guessing games, like how many fingers do I have, or what am I hiding under the camera where you can't see. 

""Read"" books to each other. 

Matching games where they each have a matching set of color cards or shape cards or pictures and one holds up a card and the other finds a match and they take turns going first. 

Or a similar game but they each half of a picture and they have to find the matches together. 

Draw a picture of their friend in the computer and share, if they are around four or have a well developed vocabulary then they could even tell each other a story about they got in the computer. 

Watch each other make themselves a small snack. 

Help each other decide what shirt to wear that day. 

Make a costume with their families and then wear it on Skype and pretend to be whatever they are dressed up as.
