So recognize not all men are bad, but the men you've encountered are, but all the bad things they do is because of them, it's all on them, don't make them the favor of justifying their behaviour cause they're men. Be critical of bad people because they're bad people, not because of their traits, or social position or gender. Wish you the best and hope you can work through your situation, it is a burden when your own father isn't a good person but in the end that's his problem, not yours."

Makeup is self expression, you wanna look all cute and shit with Korean makeup? Go ahead. You wanna go alternative with dark lipstick and graphic liner? You can! You wanna look hydrated and put together with dewy foundation? You go! Just let everyone else do their thing. There's no ""right way"" to do makeup, it's just different trends."

Cause I think in this case, it's better to just rip the band-aid off lol this show was lost without GRRM's full perspective. They could've gotten 3 years and I bet people would still not be satisfied, hell, I'm starting to think GRRM is putting it off because he is afraid to disappoint people, it's a complex story."
