yoga,fm5e065,t3_ft6m0f,1585771162.0,"I just finished Home and had a great experience. I'd say I practice at an intermediate level but recently had a long break off of yoga. Home brought me back to my connection with yoga and helped me to become much more confident with flowing on my own. The 30 days gave me a new vocabulary to work with and explore during my practice. I highly recommend it. They were short sessions of yoga that felt easy to commit to.

I'll be keeping up with the comments here to see which I should do next!"
BipolarReddit,flptqz2,t3_fqbfq3,1585368574.0,"I was also recently diagnosed and something that both my therapist and psychiatrist told me has changed my outlook. It isn't really about the label of the diagnosis so much as it is the management. Bipolar is such a buzzword and has so many upsetting stigmas associated with it. If you can think about your diagnosis as the first step in the journey to managing your mood, you may end up with a sense of comfort. It took me so long to find out what the hell was different with me and why antidepressants didn't work. After finding out that I have a mood disorder, I was able to approach my cognitive behavioral therapy sessions with a LOT more clarity.

In saying that, you're allowed to feel scared and worried. I was too. Taking the time and more importantly wanting to educate yourself about this diagnosis may make things easier for you ‚ù§Ô∏è"

bipolar2,fkrkzr8,t3_fk8l3q,1584470919.0,"I switched from zoloft to Lamictal once I was finally diagnosed with bipolar and over the course of the first few months my once very thick, gorgeous curly hair thinned out to a sublte wave. I miss my thick hair and have been hoping for a solution. My nails are also super thin but I'm not sure if this is due to lamictal. I'm wondering if anybody has tried Biotin as a hair and nail supplement and noticed a change while on Lamictal?? Curious."

yoga,fk3p3gr,t1_fk3o1su,1583842251.0,"In one of my yoga classes, during savasana, the instructor had us turn our palms up if we were open to adjustments, but simply had us flip them face down if we preferred no adjustments. I wish it were that simple and quiet during the flow of class though. Hopefully your experience becomes less stressful ‚ù§Ô∏è"

BipolarReddit,f9gz0g7,t3_e4wx7o,1575306778.0,"Tell your therapist exactly what you want to get out your sessions, just like you said here. Also keep in mind that you don't need to stay with the same therapist. I went through multiple before I found the one that stuck. Keep your head up. She should open to hearing what you need out of therapy and what your goals are. Maybe at the start of your next session you can bring this up. Personally, my therapist will start the session by asking me about my previous week to get the conversation going, but we then steer towards the unpacking of trauma and such. Being open and honest will only help you here and being a licensed professional, your therapist should absolutely appreciate that."
