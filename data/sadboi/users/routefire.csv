IndiaInvestments,fr3c2yt,t3_gm7k7t,1589854203.0,"Conspiracy theory: FB wants to turn Whatsapp into a Wechat like super app. They need lots of regulatory approvals. I mean there are some hundred thousand UPI apps already and yet Whatsapp is still working on their UPI integration. Getting in bed with RIL ensures access to the very top.

This doesn't explain the investment by the PE firms, but they probably brought the cover story about how Jio is about to create another e-commerce giant. As every Indian shopper knows, this local seller model won't work without significant alterations. Small Indian businesses have pathetic standards of customer service, and are out to fuck the customer over every rupee. Jio will need something similar to Amazon's ""delivered by Amazon"" programme, where they will take responsibility of delivery and customer experience. If aggregators like Cloudtail are allowed to continue, Amazon will have scale and Jio won't. 

All that said I'm really curious about how RIL will play the e-commerce game. They're smart enough to understand the problems with their kirana model."

1) When you were setting up the phone, did you uncheck all kind of extra ""features"" that MIUI offers? If not, you may wish to reset the phone.

2) Use the Xiaomi debloater tool, removes most of their crapware.

3) For the 4-5  system apps (which can't be removed), you need to manually go to the settings for each app and turn off ""recommendations""."
