relationship_advice,fqlmclx,t3_gjh004,1589461618.0,"People on reddit are so weird, and as soon as one person comments something other people jump on it and post more intense and rude variations. If she is LYING FREQUENTLY, and you repeatedly tell her this is your one deal breaker, then that’s OK and you don’t need a fucking therapist or whatever. It’s perfectly reasonable to not want your partner to lie semi-frequently, even if it’s a white lie. People saying “yeah this happens all the time and your example is trash” are absurd. You even said it was something small. In isolation and in a different relationship where this is not literally the ONLY boundary, then yeah it’s something to brush off. But if it’s a repeating pattern of behavior that you have repeatedly and directly communicated is something you can’t accept - but she continues to do it anyway - then you have every right to be upset. 

People in the thread saying you need to decide whether this is actually a dealbreaker are right. I don’t have advice on how you specifically should approach that, cuz to me a dealbreaker means I end the relationship if it’s violated, especially if it happens consistently. Seems to me you’re torn between not having this pattern again in your life, and your love for this girl. I’m wishing you the best in that. My 2 cents would be to abort mission because this will probably continue (like someone else said she’s getting 0 consequences). 

Just want to let you know that no, you’re not crazy or stupid-naive or whatever people are saying. Yeah you’ve had trauma and it would be a great idea to get therapy/help for it, but that doesn’t mean this isn’t a perfectly reasonable boundary. 

Best of luck. Try and glean useful advice from this thread and although it might be tough, also try and ignore the weirdos who just see one comment and start throwing similar vitriolic shit your way. Wishing you a happy and fulfilling love life."
survivinginfidelity,fq64j46,t1_fq4ult9,1589124341.0,"I think one reason it hits so hard is that her emotions were real. The actress was cheated on in real life, and she talked about how she knew exactly how to “act” it out because she’s lived it herself. I’m sorry it’s a bit of a trigger, it’s not fair to you.

survivinginfidelity,fpnskem,t1_fpms00i,1588771671.0,"So you think the best course of action to maximize happiness is to get your DEPRESSED HUSBAND a job with the people who fucked his wife multiple times? He’s gonna shake their hands, look in their eyes and say “thank you.” Meanwhile everyone but him knows the truth. But don’t worry, he’ll be happy you got him a job! He’ll probably thank YOU too, and I’m sure your immoral ass will happily say you’re welcome and be overall glad you fucked other people, destroyed your marriage, and cucked your husband with his coworkers and boss that you brought into his life. 

You’re a terrible wife and a terrible person. Stop treating your best friend and the love of your life like a POS that you can fuck around on and be proud of it. Psycho."

We often don’t have people to look up to because there’s such a stigma that few people are open about it. I plan to be a physician, and it’s tough for a lot of us in higher level education (of course, it’s hard for all of us; I’m just speaking from my own experience) to handle so many things including coursework, clinical duties, exams, medical appointments, medication adjustments, sleep cycle disturbances, etc. Mark Vonnegut is the only openly bipolar physician that I’ve come across."

bigdickproblems,fjetrqn,t1_fjeocfa,1583278079.0,"It’s warm and wet. She can control the “ring feeling” around your dick with her lips. You can feel the tongue on the underside of your cock. It feels different depending on what part of her tongue she’s using and whether it’s flat or flexed. If she’s great at deepthroating she can lick part of your ballsack too, which feels insane when you cum. She can play with your balls too at the same time. I don’t think there’s a way to properly describe it, it needs experience to do it justice. The only better feeling (at least for me) is cumming balls deep in a pussy, but the two feel pretty different. 

Downsides: she might gag a lot (some people might be into this but I’m not). Teeth can be a massive problem depending on size of either your dick or her mouth. 

Note: if partner is male replace “she” with “he”"

Right now isn’t the time to make such a life altering decision. You’re not in the correct state of mind. I think we’ve all been there. 

Personally, I had to take time out of grad school when I was diagnosed. Came back after a year, then had to take ANOTHER year because my mind still wasn’t ready. It hurt and sucked and I felt like I could never get through this and wouldn’t hack it. Well. I’m back and I’m hacking it as best I can. 

Don’t do this to save future heartbreak. You’re hurting really bad now, so take care of yourself now. There are some times in our bipolar ass lives where you just need to take it one day at a time. 

You can get through this. Right now, just get time off to try and get your mind right (relatively speaking!). Have some stability and get your professional help. I promise that if my dumbass could do it, you can too."

medicalschool,fh3dfxm,t3_f0x1zx,1581267730.0,"Weird that people keep saying peds at their programs are malignant, and that it’s all institution dependent? I always thought they were pretty friendly and nice, and that’s one of the reasons I planned on doing it. On rotations, my group went to peds after surgery and we were shocked by how nice they were treating us. We were suspicious that they were being patronizing or that it was some sort of trick. Turns out, they were just being kind, and they know they’re the rotation after surgery so they made an effort to be extra nice lol. I noticed that at other institutions and from talking to friends at other schools who echoed the sentiment. Surprising to see so many people here saying otherwise! 

As for surgery, I think that had a lot more variety. I met some fuckin cool surgeons, some that were interested in teaching, one let me use the bovi in the OR, and two of them were goddamn geniuses and super humble. Then there was the one attending that was a straight up malicious asshole to students, a resident that notoriously goes out of his way to treat med students like shit (straight up told me he was gonna cut my throat in the OR when the attending was on the comp), and a scrub nurse that aggressively argued with me for 2 minutes about shit that my attending had just told me to do until he had to interrupt the operation to tell her to back off. She did end up apologizing though, which I was shocked by. 

Overall, I’m sure there’s institution-dependent variety. But I really do think the stereotypes have some substance to them. And it seems like no matter what institution you’re at, anesthesiology is and always will be chill as fuck."
medicalschool,fefayjm,t3_eotsc6,1579052318.0,"I do relatively regularly. I don’t during the last 10 or so days leading up to a shelf, or if I’m on a crazy rotation like surgery (would if I had a free weekend though)

I smoked a TON my first year and a half, smoked 0 during the 3 months before step and honestly yeah, my memory improved and I was sharper on a day to day basis. I probably could’ve done better during preclinicals if I didn’t smoke. I think for most people regular MJ use does cause mental fog that accumulates over time. 

I don’t really plan on stopping soon, but when I start residency will probably stop for a bit to make sure I become competent enough where I’d feel comfortable it wouldn’t affect my care of my patients and also do it rarely, only if I have 2 days off in a row so I can recover to 100% next day."
medicalschool,fdn6nev,t3_em9nme,1578578742.0,"Ok I just took mine a week ago. One thing to make sure of is KNOW how to treat/manage DIC, because that showed up 3x and I didn’t know what to do. I think the trick is “treat underlying disease” but nuances like what to transfer, what they need prior to surgery, etc (wish I knew the answers to these to help you out but I don’t). 

Also, there was a lot more breast stuff than I would’ve thought so review that. Maybe a breeze through that pathoma section could help. 

TTTS vs cord entanglement for mono/dichorionic and di/di respectively. 

A lot of stuff I thought was high yield didn’t show up. Only had one question on moles. None on developmental abnormalities (AIS, A1 reductase, etc). But my friends had a lot of high yields when they took it, since I missed it and had to make it up. So it may have just been my test. 

I think with it being tomorrow, just hit high yield concepts and also DIC cuz I was kicking myself afterward for not being able to answer those questions. If you have any questions for me just let me know. You got this."

The one who figured out the old Asian guys trick, and the one that “didn’t know” what knot he tied. Also the same one that scooped his daughter up at the end. 

The angry and aggressive one is the one that tied the knot. He’s the one that was arrested and bugging out “THEYRE GONNA KILL ME” when he was in prison, and the one who was having an affair. He’s the one that got in fights with the wife. And also the one that went to see Robert’s magic trick when the calm brother (that lives) said to just leave him alone.

bipolar,f9us47h,t3_e6sc72,1575656717.0,"I think that the potential, although sometimes stunted by our illness (and sometimes for prolonged periods of time), is still there. It’s difficult to get back to “normal” and tough to accept that we might not be as sharp/efficacious/whatever as we would have been without this shit, but I also think our minds expand in different ways and that through a combination of perseverance, tenacity, and medical treatment, we have more potential than we think we do. 

Those struggling, stay strong. Things might seem hopeless at some times, but that doesn’t mean we have to give up or resign ourselves to a less fulfilling life. It’s a more complicated and turbulent life trajectory, but I think we’re capable of so much more than we know, and that our experiences shape us into different people with different strengths that the adults from our childhood could never have predicted. 

Sorry for the rambling and run-on sentences. This just helped me when I was going through my really fuckin rough times. All we can do is keep on keeping on, accept that sometimes we’ll have to take it one day at a time, and hopefully realize that we have more potential than we ever knew."
