Whatcouldgowrong,fqz4lao,t1_fqxdomo,1589759811.0,"> You can’t blame your shitty hand that you’ve been dealt. Own it, and make the best out of it.

I completely agree with this. People have the power to change their life and shape their story more than they think. 

Everyone must take responsibility for their own life and their own actions at some point; you can’t blame your problems on your troubled past forever, for when you refuse to deal with those problems it is only you who is holding you back from being something greater. One must confront their problems and overcome them if they are to make something good of themselves."

I can attest to this. I remember being around 8 years old and one day there was a program going on. They brought us all into the cafeteria, where they had tons of grotesque images of blackened lungs, body parts rotted by cancer, etc. and essentially said “this is what drugs do to your body, don’t smoke cigarettes or do weed kiddos!” 

It was horrible, and we had to eat lunch after that.. but even that wasn’t very effective, most kids wouldn’t touch cigarettes but many, if not most, went to weed and alcohol in high school. I even saw kids do lines of cocaine in class a couple times!"
