alcoholism,ffm0ktm,t3_etjjqg,1580046688.0,Thanks guys this anxiety is crippling. I start a new job in a week and I can’t feel like this. I’m on 1mg of ativan 2 times a day as well as 600mg of gabapentin a day. I was gonna start 10mg of Prozac but that scared me too. I try deep breathing but have constant angst and fear with mixed in panic attacks. My mind just won’t slow down!

benzodiazepines,fb1cdtr,t3_eaqv1f,1576434878.0,Ok thank u this is a UA the treatment sends to a lab for like 50 people and I’m perscribed ativan but didn’t bring it home with me so I took a clonazopam
benzodiazepines,fb1auoz,t1_fb1aabc,1576434251.0,I know it doesn’t show in a quick cup but how about a reg UA? I took 4 MG on sat.
benzorecovery,f9815fq,t3_e43lj6,1575172703.0,"Ya I was given a 7 day taper with gabapentin and that was it. On top of the alcohol it’s been rough but I’m getting through it a day at a time. 
The emotional and mental part has been the hardest so far on top of the lethargy."
benzorecovery,f97ejxc,t1_f97dw6v,1575164498.0,I jumped of off at 6mg of clonazopam aday on that dose for over a year on top of alcohol.

benzorecovery,f9775ny,t1_f976zbo,1575160944.0,Thank you so much! I appreciate your kind words. Ya it was basically cold turkey just gabapentin to help and seize
benzorecovery,f96tplq,t3_e43lj6,1575151820.0,"Thank you and good for you too!!
Yes the mental and emotional part is definitely the hardest. I wasn’t on Clonazopam for long but at 6mg a day for a year plus the alcohol knocked me for a loop. I m just trying to be patient and trust the process. 
Thanks for responding"
benzorecovery,f96q74o,t3_e43lj6,1575149799.0,Thanks! I ve been completely clean for 2 months I’m just struggling with what I think are the after effects of getting sober. I’ve always struggled with anxiety but I think coming off the benzos and booze is doing a number on me. I did medically detox but the headaches to the fear and lack of motivation and fatigue are really really hard!
benzodiazepines,f87qbct,t1_f878070,1574340023.0,"Thanks so much!
Ya it’s hard especially the mental part of constant worry and anxiety. I was also drinking a lot as well so I think this is a double whammy."
benzodiazepines,f85x8xx,t3_dz7la4,1574285180.0,"Hey there,
Thank you for replying! I would but I can’t take any benzodiazepines while I’m in soberliving.
It’s been 32 days since last benzo. I feel like I worry about everything and everything and can’t stop thinking about things then I have all the physical stuff on top of the mentally 🤷‍♂️.
I am allowed gabapentin so they have me on that put there’s no way they will let me be on another benzo.
🙏🏻"
AnxietyDepression,f2tdzq1,t3_de4ogn,1570393775.0,"Hey there,
All I can say is I’m in the same boat. I don’t have all the answers iam trying to figure out them myself. I just got out of the hospital Bc I thought bad things. I’ve been on both sides of the fence . What worked in the past more than anything is seeing the RIGHT therapist that helps your way of thinking and a good psychiatrist that will really listen. I feel really helpless atm as well . I’m 38 and just lost everything. But I m trying to take my own advice and be patient and get the right help. 
Hang in there and get the help you need we can’t do this on our own.
God bless."
AnxietyDepression,f16b90r,t3_d6o57s,1569207403.0,"Thank you for your kind words. 
I don’t know where to go from here. I’m 38 and lost it all. Now since being a buisness owner I have no college degree and in a world of mess. Two days no alcohol and I’m having to pay out of pocket for a psychiatrist to help me get off these damn benzos my dr perscribed me. I just got back from CA to CT 3 days ago and not sure how I’m gonna get a job or anything. I got hit with a misdemeanor drug possession from over two years ago but havnt been convicted yet and it’s my first arrest. It sucks being a scared adult with no family  it my sister who’s my best friend but there’s not really room in the house for me. 
I just am going through so much loss and regret and fear of what is to come it’s hard to see a light out of this darkness. I’m trying AA again but they aren’t gonna pay my bills or rent ect. It’s easy for someone to say “a day at a time” but the anxiety is so powerful."
Anxiety,ezgoe96,t3_d0q8ly,1567899365.0,And yes I’m also really tired of people just not understanding anxiety. It’s very hard.
Anxiety,ezgnhqa,t3_d0q8ly,1567899027.0,"I completely have the same problem. I worry about my worry then have preservative thoughts on one subject like what I will do for work? Why havnt this person called me, what do I do?!!! 
The what if’s kill me and the anxiety is like a snowball effect. Iam currently out of work and moved a year ago from NY to CA. Just went through a divorce and lost everything. I am scared to death Bc I had a buisness now it’s gone and I don’t have a college degree. It’s scary as it is but my anxiety is making every moment pure hell. I’m trying to stay busy but no friends or family and not having a job is killing me. I don’t know what to do. I’m applying to jobs in my field back east but I get really far in the interview process and they just keep taking there time. 
I am 38 years old and lost a 13 year marriage and half a mill to her. I have nothing but enough for 6 more weeks of supporting myself. I am through the roof with my anxiety and thoughts. I go to therapy and iam on clonazopam but I’m tapering off that. I just told my story to relate. Anxiety is a bitch and when I’ve done best dealing with it is when I have goals and positive outlets. I just am in a dark spot and can’t do anymore that the steps I’m taking. If you want to talk I’m here and maybe we can help each other. 
Let’s both fight like non other💪🙏🏻👍"
benzorecovery,ezb1tcf,t3_d04rkf,1567811552.0,"Dude good for you!!! Get a support system. I am not psychologically addicted to Kpins but I’m on 6 mg a day and my dr isn’t helping me taper even tho I asked. I can only relate to getting a 2000mg a day addiction to icy and lost everything. I heard once connection is the opposite of addiction. This is so true. I’m in CA from NY and no job atm.
It’s such a struggle to go alone . So keep up the good work and be around the right people to support you.🙏🏻"
AnxietyDepression,ezb14ty,t1_ezat6e0,1567811207.0,I get it but I don’t have the means for detox and I’m not abusing my meds wich I knew nothing about when prescribed. My sponsor knows everything. I can’t help a dr. I told I was 11 months sober of alcohol perscibed me this crap. It’s hard to trust when you are honest . 🙏🏻
AnxietyDepression,ez19r8r,t3_czqqo8,1567646246.0,"I go to AA every day. It was hard relapsing after 11 months was judged. But it’s not about them it’s about me. I can’t help seeking outside help and having a Dr. perscribe what he said would help me. He knows I’m in recovery from alcohol, I’m just glad I sought advice bf the mental addiction kicked in. Still scared tho after a 2000mg a day addiction wich was 5 years ago then a two year alcohol problem. I’m just super depressed and anxious now. I lost everything due to my first addiction with pain meds starting from a fall at 33 years old now I’m alone all the way across the country."
AnxietyDepression,ez18j8n,t3_czqqo8,1567645959.0,Doing all I can.... my therapist is good but it’s hard to find a psychiatrist I pay outta pocket too. I asked to be reduced and he will only do one at a time and the Kpins he’s reducing so fast. I’m not a Dr. but makes no sense to lower a benzo fast but not agree to lower a stimulant at the same time . These were my starting doses.
AnxietyDepression,ez0fjw8,t3_czqqo8,1567635993.0,A half to a pint a day is a lot for me atm. I was at a handle a day 14 months ago until I recently lost my sobriety

He new from day one I drank bf now for the last month I’ve been drinking again about a pint a day to “ relieve “ what I feel what has been brought on by these perscribed meds. I’m so disappointed and scared. The drinking I know is very dangerous as well so I do my best not to go down the road and grab a quick fix . Idk I’m at a loss"
benzorecovery,ez0di9p,t3_cykll3,1567635161.0,"Hey there thanks for responding. I saw my psychiatrist he dropped me 6-5 mg I tried to show him the ashot Manuel but he was t listening.

I know it’s a horrid thing to do but iam unemployed atm and I have no friends or family as I justvmoved last year. I’m drinking about half to a pint a day not getting messed up butvspread out. I’m super scared. And I’m going to therapy but my psychiatrist just overprescribing me is so wrong. I asked for a reduction . 6mg kpin, 70 mg vyvanse and 2800mg of gabapentin.
I’m fucking lost"
AnxietyDepression,ez0cniy,t3_czqqo8,1567634817.0,Can anyone help

benzorecovery,ez06f8i,t3_cykll3,1567631804.0,Does this thread still show ?
benzorecovery,eyybmij,t3_cykll3,1567579040.0,Anyone is there anything I can do ? I saw my psychiatrist today and asked for a taper he then said 6 right to 5 once I showed him the Ashton manual and asked him about Valium . I didn’t even get a script I’m confused of what to do and scared. He did fill anything else either they are due on the 13 th he just said leave a message each day the next five days.
benzorecovery,eyybh2a,t1_eyusljj,1567578845.0,My psychiatrist went right from 6-5mg! I’m really freaking out . I showed him the Ashton manual and all wtf. !!!!
benzorecovery,eyxqv2z,t3_cykll3,1567560243.0,Wtf
benzorecovery,eywgvk0,t3_cykll3,1567529200.0,So I saw my Dr. all he did was drop the Kpins by 1 mg from 6-5 I showed him the Ashton Manuel and he rejected the Valium. Now I’m panicking.
benzorecovery,eyv0qan,t1_eyusljj,1567477291.0,I will talk to my psychiatrist about using the Ashton method tomorrow that also suggests using Valium while I taper. Luckly I started researching and came on here before it went any longer ! I can’t go through what I went through with the 2000mg icy habit I had years ago then the doc but me on 20 mg of subutex for a year . Then no taper was the longest worst thing ever almost killed me.
benzorecovery,eyuq4tm,t1_eyumh1y,1567469102.0,I’m going to my psychiatrist tomorrow. It’s rediculous that he put me on 6mg oh Kpins and that was mybstarting dose and 70mg of vyvanse then 2400mg of gabapentin. I feel so depressed and no motivation and very emotional. Either crazy anxiety and obsessive thinking on one thing or depression so unreal.
benzorecovery,eyujzms,t1_eytre1w,1567464206.0,I’m super depressed and dont want todo anything. Could this be the clonazopam on top of it iam not working and am in a new state so I don’t know anyone. It sucks to sleep till 2:00pm and stay up till 4.am I just have no motivation.
benzorecovery,eyuf9me,t3_cykll3,1567460592.0,Ya I’m already depressed as hell. I don’t know if it’s the Kpins or coming off the vyvanse

benzorecovery,eysvp67,t1_eysva6k,1567413323.0,So if I slow taper it shouldn’t be that bad since I’ve only been. On them for 5 months? I can’t miss work and can’t take any time off.

benzorecovery,eyso4yk,t3_cykll3,1567405578.0,"I need the gaba to offset the Kpins Bc it’s a anti seizure med and helps with the kpin withdraws.
I’m more worried about the kips atm Bc I haven’t been on them long and want off. I’ve been on 2400mg of gabapentin a day for 2 years."

benzorecovery,eysnlga,t3_cykll3,1567404930.0,So sine I have only been on them for about 5 months I may be able to do 1mg a week ?
benzorecovery,eysmyl9,t3_cykll3,1567404197.0,Thnx everyone I think I’m letting my head get to me . I went from 6down to 4 in 6 days so maybe I’m not fully physically dependent but I’m at about 5 mg now. I read a25% reduction every two weeks should be ok since I havnt be on them too long. I’m not psychologically addicted but I’m scared as hell. From anyone’s opinion should the withdrawal be horrible considering I have only been on them 4 1/2 months ?
Drugs,eyrwycb,t3_cy6qvf,1567380666.0,I don’t want scare tactics I’m already afraid of withdrawal. I havnt been on this amount but for 5 months. If it done right with my doc will it be horrible?

I’ve always had these tendencies but when I played sports in college or had a job I could cope. Now I’m starting to drink and that’s making it worse.
