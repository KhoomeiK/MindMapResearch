askgaybros,fr1yti5,t3_gm482t,1589828246.0,"I want to chime in here with some other advice. I'm someone where this happened, with my extended family. I blacked out at a family wedding and came to crying about me being gay to my aunt, and then blacked out and came to walking somewhere in the suburbs. It was horrifying and haunts me to look back on, I could have easily died. Everyone in my family was terrified that night because I apparently ran away. I was not able to contact them. This sounds bad because it is, but it's the low point in a long history of (( casual )) drinking. I wish that this was when I stopped, and I did for a bit, but it was not the last time I blacked out by a long shot. 

Heed this warning that this night gave you. Alcohol is an addictive substance that is largely supported by society. Your response to this indicates that you have issues with disclosure and inhibition, as I did. Alcohol is the perfect monster for this type of socially anxious person. I know it might sound wild, and I don't know your future really, but I can tell you in my own experience the way alcohol works is that every mistake becomes a new normal. I remember being horrified the first time I blacked out (not this time). This incident above was followed by abstinence, then 3 more years of binge drinking and occasional blackouts. It ruined my relationship I had over those years. Even then a year after that I blacked out after a nice night out with my friends, had the cops called to my neighborhood because I didn't know where I was. I was just down the street from my house, covered in my own vomit. My father had to see this. 

I'm not a weak willed person, I've done other drugs responsibly. I managed to smoke for a few years when I was younger and quit. Alcohol specifically has done much more damage both to my health, my relationships, and brought me closer to death than any other substance. The issue is that alcohol is both addictive in the psychological and physical sense AND is widely supported by society. My family and friends always drank and looked down on me when I wouldn't drink at literally every gathering. **Even after all of these things happening my family views me not drinking at gatherings as ""not having fun"" even if I'm having fun.** Listen to the red flag that this situation has created and control your drinking now. I've learned that I have severe social anxiety and I have also learned how to socialize and moderate my drinking. Hangovers certainly helped with this ngl, but you can absolutely get there as well."

That can be pretty offputting to put an sti in your profile page, especially if many people don't understand it. I **never** did that because point blank herpes is not something that defines me. I always just disclosed during chat. The only people who need to know are the people who are going to have sex with me. I only took meds when I had the first two outbreaks, the other couple of outbreaks were so small I didn't even bother. It did come with flu like symptoms though so I often knew it was coming. When I had an outbreak I usually didn't have sex the whole month and a bit to cover all my bases (pre-outbreak, during, and a bit after it heals). I've considered daily medication but in my case there's barely any point. I always use condoms anyway for every type of sex and I don't get outbreaks often or at all anymore. Honestly the condom thing is more a personal choice too, like the gay community really dislikes using condoms for oral and that's pushed me more towards it because I just don't want the headache of another sti!

Don't apologize for asking questions, I posted my comment because I wanted to answer any questions you have. I wish I had someone like myself when I initially got it, to tell me it would be fine. I recently had a really funny hookup where I was trying to explain it to this couple and they just told me to come over. It was really intimidating because they made it seem like we were just going to talk and I was going to Educate Them On Herpes. We had like an hour conversation about it and it ended with us hooking up for a few more hours."
Herpes,fqcqgf9,t3_ghx1xe,1589265608.0,"So I got herpes (HSV-1 gentially) about six years ago, when I first went into college. In the initial period after I got it I wasn't really dating at the time, and the reception was generally neutral to mixed. I was seeing someone casually at the time (to be more specific: I was seeing a dude who didn't make it official but we were a hookup that turned into spending all our afternoons together for months and I got herpes from another regular fwb, which was fine because again, we were not actually dating) and he was fine with it. The hookups after we parted ways were fine as well. Many people responded with not caring or some caution. Some dudes responded with ""oh I have herpes too!"" and some dudes of course dropped me. It was weird because nearly of all of these interactions were triggered by my desire to wear a condom rather than any actual inquiry on their part. It's disturbing, having herpes makes you realize how unsafe much of the gay community acts. People are taken aback when you suggest condoms for oral sex, even though that's **precisely how I got herpes in the first place!** My suggesting of wearing condoms literally would draw more reaction and ire than the herpes itself. It did hurt to have some dudes dip out after mentioning it but for the most part those dudes were the faceless ""ready to fuck two minutes ago"" high risk types of dudes you'd see on grindr. I was using all the regular apps (grindr, scruff, a4a)

I was extremely worried about how it would impact my dating life. I can personally attest that it has not impacted it much. After this period of hooking up again I quickly got into a two year on and off again relationship. Then a three year relationship followed that. Neither had herpes and neither contracted herpes, but I always used condoms in the second one out of fear. In terms of symptoms the primary was the worst, and the second outbreak was pretty bad too but less bad. The third was slightly better than that and so on. I used to get an annual outbreak around the same time of year. Then one year (I think the fourth?) I had a really stressful thing happen and I had a stress related outbreak months after my annual. That concerned me a lot, but I didn't have an outbreak at all in the following year. I have had many equally (and much more) stressful things happen in the following timespan but I have not had *any* outbreaks since. If you have any questions, let me know!"

My gay friends will be talking about relationship issues as them as individuals (philosophies on life or love) or with cultural contexts (families and values) but with my straight friends it's very ""bitches, amirite?"" where the issue is very clearly gendered but they view it as a personal relationship struggle.

Most of the people who enjoy it are the ones who *do* the deep throating and when you ask them why it's something along the lines of ""it's just enjoyable to take the whole thing"" which points more towards a mental kink type thing (people feeling kinky bc they're Doing The Porn Thing) rather than anything inherent about the act.

I would definitely suggest being open minded to the idea of relationships with women, like trying a first date for fun or something casual along those lines, if you wanted to explore it because romance is often an unexpected journey and you do have the element of sexual compatibility there. You might discover a whole new side to yourself that hasn't been explored or that you do enjoy romance with women and simply hadn't uncovered it prior to trying it.

It's also possible that you could have a strong romantic drive with men specifically and not women. I am suggesting trying casual dating with women because it often happens with gay men (myself included) where when we first realize we're gay we go through a ""oh but it's only sexual, i can't imagine myself with a man romantically"" process.

- feels kinda good in the sense that you can feel how it's additive to the experience of jerking off

- literally the moment i start bottoming I feel like I'm going to cum if a gentle breeze brushes over my dick.

I don't know if I've really had a prostate orgasm or not. I only recently got to this last stage after seven years of on and off bottoming, and I haven't been able to explore it due to corona and a sexless past relationship. I do vaguely think I know what prostate stimulation feels like and I can tell when it's being hit. I've had one instance of struck by lightning ""oh you hit it"" where a guy was using toys. I also had one partner who fingered me sometimes and it felt like he was jerking me off from the inside. I've used a lot of anal toys and prostate massagers and I think that's why I've experienced this progression in ability."

askgaybros,fpgohkn,t3_gd9ly9,1588606627.0,"Just flat out no. It's not normal to escalate a fight into violence and don't let him normalize that. There are plenty of people who can have arguments and disagreements without getting physical. Think about how you would respond if *a friend* acted in the way he had just acted. You would likely never speak to them again and avoid them because they clearly have violent tendencies. You're not flushing everything down the drain, you're reacting as anyone would to this type of a thing happening. If you caught him cheating you would also break up with him, which would suck but wouldn't nullify the past years of the relationship. 

Don't even bother with all of the rules that you gave him. You're worth more than this. This isn't even breaking into any of the other stuff (a fight over hair becoming this level). I will say that in this type of a situation when you leave is the most dangerous time and I highly recommend you read The Gift of Fear or just stay safe and keep your eyes peeled for him.

I was literally just in this situation. I was living with someone who I was dating for years and they suddenly got violent in a fight. They had never shown violent tendencies before but it was definitely emotionally abusive in retrospect. He blamed his temper on all of the fights we had and it was always when he was drunk. I thought I was going crazy and had such a low self-esteem, but I knew in the last few months that something was up. Things went from ""bad fights"" to ""I don't feel safe"". I moved out the next day when he wasn't there, but I remember in the moment thinking so distinctly ""none of this was worth it. i saw all the red flags. why did i wait. if i end here then i'll never see my family again."" and then i was just thinking about them."

Additionally there's really no reason to have to hide something like a pornhub account from your finacee if they're going to be the one person you're boning for the rest of your life. On top of that, even if it was something equivalent to a pornhub account, going out of one's way to hide something because it's embarrassing is revealing that you prefer to maintain appearances and lie rather than address any emotional situations. It's a red flag.

Think about it. You really think that hiding aspects of your sexuality with the one sexual partner you will have for the next 50 years is a good idea? Especially when you're actively in the process of deciding to get married?"

I mean kudo's to you OP for trying to work it out, but this is no small blip on the radar. You really need to take note of this as a behavior of her's and how she acts.

I basically just accept that I'm nervous and go anyway. Like 85% of dealing with anxiety is that, ""oh I'm nervous. WELP"" and then continuing on.

A great aspect of this is that going down each path teaches you so much more about yourself, the dangers you may face down a new one and how to identify them, and what paths you do or don't like. You bring all that with you and then you can get better at sorting out what paths to go down."

The person who cheats would break up if they didn't *want* to stay together. It's much easier to do that. There has to be a reason for the cheating, they need something that is not being provided in the relationship unless it's a mindless drunken mistake or something. Then there needs to be **communication issues where this need cannot be heard by the other partner** and this can be any number of things. Maybe the partner reacted negatively in the past to some form of open communication and the cheater is translating that to this issue as well. Maybe they are just bad at communicating. Maybe the other partner is not understanding it as it's being communicated. Either way, there is a need that is not being communicated. The partner needs this need met, and wants to stay together. They might not understand the consequence (or worse do not care) if they get caught. Often they do it fully expecting to not be caught.

I *was* sort of insulting them because again, the sub is unpopular opinion, not popular opinion. And they're not just stating an opinion they actively navigated to this specific sub, typed up the entire post, and submitted and then edited the post. It was a very active process on their part. 

I'm not even going to respond to the sex stuff because it's going to just get really tangential. Both of your replies to my comments did not really address what I was talking about, and continued your process of moving the goal posts. (Being against hookup culture = being against the constant spread of sti's) became (condoms aren't 100% effective, sex is not exactly the same as driving, sex is not needed, the world is overpopulated). This is a vague shotgun approach to changing the nature of what we're talking about, into something more hairy (semantics, opinion) to make your originally outlandish argument seem more nuanced and valid. I'm not gonna play ball with that."
