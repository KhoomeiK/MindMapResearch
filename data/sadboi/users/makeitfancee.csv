EDAnonymous,fbi4v2z,t1_fbi1l2u,1576890840.0,"Well... it turned into c/sp and lax abuse with only a couple of binges here and there. That went on for another couple of months. Then I really tried to restrict again. But I continued to c/sp. Then I was sent to the hospital(unrelated to ed) and that’s when the restriction came in full force. After that I was sent to a PRTF where I continued to restrict and lose weight. I eventually became underweight again. But once I left the PRTF I started the daily binging all over again. Gained ten pounds in a weeks time. This is where I am now. Although the binging has been shrinking in size somewhat. And I’ve only binged twice this week. I’m also currently in an ED PHP. 

So really, I don’t know what to tell you or how to stop it. But I’ll say this- maybe you should consider treatment if you’re not already getting it. The thing is though, that you kind of have to want to recover to get anywhere in treatment. I’m kind of stuck in the middle because I want to recover but I still want to restrict until I’m underweight again. So treatment isn’t going well."
