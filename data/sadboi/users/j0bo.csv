AmItheAsshole,fpmmf0k,t1_fi75qyi,1588736323.0,I can't believe you said this. You just said you wanted to punish your daughter by hurting her emotionally. That's a daughter who's  out of the house at her first opportunity. That's a daughter who never talks to her father again. And that is abusive. You should not be in charge of disciplining your children. I'm sure her heart is shattered and I know she's not ever going to forget this. All you've shown her is that your parenting style is mean-spirited and merciless.

Her brain isn't even fully developed and you add that stress. You didnt want kids and now you're getting your jollies by using them. Might as well be getting something out of them, right? I mean, they owe you. You could be a really bad mean guy, what's a little money to keep that at bay? Since they are objects your useless wife made you get and not people you chose to make."

No matter her reasoning, this is HER problem, not yours, and she is being awfully selfish by asking this of you. Maybe it's not time to meet them, or maybe it's time to step away from someone who needs to work on their own shit. I understand her fear, but again, that is her issue and she's trying to make you help her hide from it. Not your responsibility. She has to figure that out herself and decide what is most important. It has to be devastating, the prospect of losing your parents over religion, but it's the boat she's in, and she's going to have to choose whether or not to row. I think all you can do is continue to hold your ground. I hope she finds better ways to cope."

WelcomeToPlathville,fnyb457,t1_fai2cm7,1587358024.0,"I will say, when you have someone who makes you feel helpless and controlled among other things, it's hard to let your guard down even when they're being nice or unassuming. For one, it's like, I'm not going to let you skim over all the ways you've hurt me with this shitty bandaid. No. For two, they're controlling the narrative even through their kindness. They're still trying to control you and the situation and it feels sickening to step into the trap. You end up looking like a bitch, but when someone has hurt you deeply and cant even muster the courtesy to acknowledge it on a meaningful level... and then they do something ""nice"" for you to entrap you into either making fake peace or playing the villain so they can have a reason to hate you again... it makes you feel gross.

Maybe not anymore, but that, again, would be your doing. You need therapy, because the only issue your child is going to have with her adopted cousin is whatever you pass on to her. In fact, the girls would probably love having the same name, they'd think its cool. You have a big decision to make. Are you going to create an environment where two little girls are best friends who love each other? Or will your girl hate her cousin for the petty reasons her mother has created? All the ugliness you're feeling? You are manifesting it and it's going to become your reality when it's currently just your delusion. Again, GET THERAPY."

I do have one friend in the new city I moved to who attached to me immediately and doesn't let me get away with isolation all the time, which I hate when I'm ~in it~ but I'm actually extremely thankful because she has shown me that her friendship is unconditional. When you're younger you think finding unconditional love is going to be a lot easier than it actually is lol. I hope you have or find at least one person who makes you feel missed when you're down and out. It's something I think everyone needs whether you resist or welcome it. I still push back and I still isolate. We do what we have to do to get through it and the right friends will still be there despite us.
