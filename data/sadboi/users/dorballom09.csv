survivinginfidelity,fqpf45e,t3_gk1wwx,1589544749.0,"Get some medical help. You need to make a stance about your relationship with your parents. Some therapy will help you probably, close friends could also be of help but since you moved out, I guess you dont have anyone to get help near you. Just to talk your mind, getting your thoughts straight.

From my experience, fk your so called relationship with your parents. Your mental health comes first. Living in that sick-toxic environment or being in touch with those sick people will only help them but it will distroy you eventually. Its not like your parents are dying or poor people without money. They just want your attention. 

Your father is a broken man(sorrry but yeah) and your mother is a outright cheater. They are probably using you as some kind of glue to keep their long broken relation to keep a good appearance outside like, 'hey guys, look we are one good happy family, so treat us with respect' type bullshit. Its sick and you should not play any part in it. 

Your already damaged to some degree imo. If you dont live a healthy life from now on, your life is over. You should focus on yourself, get some good friends, a life partner maybe. Keep a limited contact with your family untill you have improved your mental health. The way I see it, if you keep getting involved with these guys and their never ending problems, you will get broken soon. Tell your parents properly that your done with their bullshit, you need some alone time to lead a healthy life, some distance is you deserve."
