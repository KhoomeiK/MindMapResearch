I sometimes have creeping doubts about me & my fianc√©‚Äôs compatibility, ESPECIALLY when we are in a season of more stress & arguing (ie. NOW!). I‚Äôve felt awkward about voicing these doubts because it seems like it‚Äôs kind of taboo to voice anything other than ‚ÄúI KNOW MY FIANC√â AND I ARE 100000% SUPPOSED TO BE TOGETHER‚Äù. Something I‚Äôve realized though is that when it‚Äôs a season of contentment and joy, the incompatibilities are still there but I perceive them as gifts instead of annoyances ‚Äî do you feel that way as well? A communication trick that has helped me during this time is recognizing some of the stories that I‚Äôm making up in my head and voicing them aloud, instead of stewing about it on my own thus leading to more disconnection and withdrawal. I try not to say ‚Äúyou always x and y‚Äù and instead I say, ‚Äúwhen you talk to me in that tone of voice, the story that I‚Äôm making up is you don‚Äôt care about me, etc.‚Äù What an excellent time to hone our communication skills and remember that marriage is constantly about choosing to love even when our partner isn‚Äôt likeable!

One advice given was to use conservative Christian language and say in a super level-headed way: ‚ÄúI appreciate your care and concern. Can you entrust me and my relationship to God and pray for me instead?‚Äù. I can see how that kind of a response would help ++ in a situation like this. There‚Äôs no use in hashing it out and sharing your views on this because you‚Äôre speaking completely different languages.

Enneagram,eurcjuh,t3_chbfto,1563992371.0,"I think if you‚Äôre serious about changing and wanting others to tell you to stop being abrasive, you need to gain some awareness into *when* and *how* you are abrasive. If I were you, I‚Äôd talk to a couple of safe people when everything is calm and ask for honest feedback re how you come off. I‚Äôd reflect on the honest feedback and that would be a really good starting point for change/self-reflection. 

Another piece is that I think for 1s, there‚Äôs a natural orientation towards what‚Äôs missing/what‚Äôs wrong/what‚Äôs not good enough. This is both a strength and a weakness. It‚Äôs hard for people who are in relationship with you to feel like they‚Äôre constantly not good enough or that there‚Äôs always something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with them. Maybe to balance out your natural orientation, try to practice gratitude everyday and notice what‚Äôs already good, lovely, and abundant in your existing relationships. 1s have a loud inner critic, so even practicing gratitude and noticing what‚Äôs already good, lovely, and abundant in *yourself* might be a fruitful place to start. As you become less of a critic towards yourself, you will naturally become less of a critic towards others. 

Another thing is try to offer more positive feedback, if you‚Äôre not already doing that. I read somewhere that healthy relationships have a ratio of 5:1 for positive interactions to negative interactions. I‚Äôm sure that the areas of improvement you bring up in your relationships are valid and dead on, but make sure to balance it out with positive interactions and positive feedback. Aim for five positive interactions/feedback for every criticism/complaint. Once you voice the criticism/compliant, give yourself time before you bring it up again instead of bringing it up every interaction which can come off as abrasive and pushy.

Hope this helps! We‚Äôre all on the journey."
