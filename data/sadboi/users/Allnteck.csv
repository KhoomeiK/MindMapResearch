iamatotalpieceofshit,fqusc0o,t1_fqupd49,1589663833.0,"this comment highlights the problem with them posting this. people online eat this up; all of the comments are ‚Äúadorable, haha!‚Äù... since they get so many likes and attention from making this content, they‚Äôre bound to anger their dog more and continue to be cruel to it. I want to own a golden someday and it‚Äôs heartbreaking to see people treat such kind creatures like toys"
iamatotalpieceofshit,fqurzpr,t1_fqull6z,1589663694.0,"you‚Äôre right, unfortunately there isn‚Äôt enough evidence to say for sure that it‚Äôs abuse or the dog being mistreated. in my experience though, it‚Äôd take a lot of mistrust for a golden to show their teeth like that. it breaks my heart to see a dog so scared..."
