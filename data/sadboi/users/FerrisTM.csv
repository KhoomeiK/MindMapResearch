ParallelUniverse,fow5jvc,t1_fovdlyp,1588113412.0,"I have to partially rescind what I initially said about it sounding a bit like psychosis, because the details that you provided make it sound like another animal entirely. I can relate to that feeling of being in the wrong universe, of having memories you shouldn't, of having puzzle pieces in your head missing or just out of grasp. I have memories that I shouldn't from lives I've never lived, which I never talk about because no one believes that stuff, anyway. I believe things about who I really am that doesn't vibe with how most people perceive the world. 

Now, I have to be careful with going down those rabbit holes because I also am aware that I have a major mental illness that can really mess with my head and my concept of reality. When I am in a psychotic episode, I experience similar feelings to deja-vu and an impending sense of wrongness, of not belonging in the life or even the reality that I am living in. I often become possessed by an intense desire to ""go home,"" whatever that really means for me. 

That being said, I firmly believe that there is more in this world than most people care to see, but it's there if you decide to peel back the curtain and take a peek. There are branches of physics that I've taken a great interest in that support the notion of parallel universes, and while theory isn't proof, it's the best we have right now. Something that really bothers me about my mental illnesses is that it's hard to know which parts of me are correct and which are bonkers. Am I wrong to believe that there is more to life than meets the eye just because my experiences don't match up with the majority's? The bothersome part of schizophrenia--to me--is the puzzling fact that so many of us have such similar ""delusions."" For instance, many of us believe that we are being watched, or have discovered aliens, or are in the wrong universe altogether, etc. Seems kind of weird to me, but I'm not a doctor.

Anyway, all of that is a very long-winded and possibly incoherent way of saying that I hear what you're saying and I honestly believe that there could be something very real to what you are experiencing. It has some things in common with psychosis, but other aspects--like the knowledge of that building and the familiarity you had there--is not something I think fits under that category. Psychosis can be very  powerful, but I don't know...I don't think that you being from a different universe is impossible. I just don't. The truth is that I don't think I'm from here, either, and I believe I can pin-point approximately where I split off from my true reality, but that's a different subject, so I'll stop here. Feel free to DM me if you want to talk more, or just reply to this in the comments. Either way, I'll see it."

As someone with this illness, it can be difficult to express myself when I'm having delusional thoughts because of a number of reasons, including a fear of being judged or sent to a hospital again. However, if your SO trusts you as much as you trust him, there's a good chance that he will be able to open up to you in bits and pieces or at least tell you when something is wrong. That's what I do when I don't feel up to telling my partner exactly what is on my mind: I let them know that I am not 100% without necessarily going into the details of why. I think they've accepted that I can't always be that open.

Another thing that your SO can do is talk to his psychiatrist or therapist or both directly, which he might choose to do if he fears worrying you or something (that's a problem for me when it comes to being honest about how I'm doing.) I find it can be enormously helpful to talk to a mental health professional regularly, because they can track how I'm doing and pick up on things that the laymen around me might not quite notice."

I attribute some of my weirdness to being on the autism spectrum and not necessarily knowing what to do all the time, but at the same time I have a growing ability to empathize with my fellow human that I feel deeply within me always. I dress how I dress, speak how I feel like speaking, and if people like it or don't like it, I suppose that's fine by me. I've been fortunate enough to make a lot of friends in residential treatment and hospital settings, and I've managed to stay in touch with them alright over the last few months and years. I am enormously grateful for them, because without them my life would be a monumentally more lonely existence.

There is a part of me that longs to be a vagabond, to leave everything I have behind and travel the country or even the world with nothing more than what I can carry with me on by back and my bike. I want to know what living feels like, because I feel inhibited from it in some ways that even now I can't quite put my finger on. Nevertheless, I have had a colorful life packed into my twenty-five short years, and I wouldn't trade it for anything even though there are plenty of times when I feel like I would. 

I try not to judge others and to treat everyone kindly because we are all people and, most of the time, everyone is doing the best they can with what they've got. I treat myself more cruelly than I would ever treat another human being.

schizophrenia,fm9rwvd,t1_fm9ficv,1585875192.0,"I'm glad that anything I said could be of help! For me, it is very obvious when I need a medication change, because the medication simply won't be working. My symptoms will still be leaking through, and if that is the case, then it's time for a talk with my psychiatrist to report that what I'm taking isn't doing its job. The solution to that is either a medication increase or a new medication altogether, which can be daunting, but it's for the best.

As for recognizing any of this...how is your SO's insight? Does he agree that he is mentally ill? If not, then it unfortunately might be up to you to spot the signs that he is slipping. However, if he's on board with treatment, it may be a lot easier to keep things on track. If he complains about hearing voices, seeing things that aren't there, or being uncertain as to what is real, these are big signs that he could be heading for another break. Littler ones might include him seeming quieter, more withdrawn, or getting preoccupied with ""odd"" hobbies or thoughts. He also might stop taking care of himself--that's a thing for a lot of people with this illness.

I hope that helps!"
schizoaffective,fm9qny8,t1_fm9iirb,1585874393.0,Ha! I hadn't thought of that. And I didn't even know that there was a remindmebot...this is good news for me!
schizophrenia,fm95wau,t3_ftst5z,1585862308.0,"I have been with my current partner for going on three years. During that time, I have spent more time in the hospital or in residential programs away from home than I have with them. While this experience may not necessarily be typical, if there was one thing I could advise of a SO of someone with schizophrenia, it would be to have patience.

As you already known, you may have to see some ugly things in your partner, and occasionally, you might be scared. However, it is important to know that, more likely than not, your SO is just as scared, and even if you fear for your safety, they are not likely to do anything that would hurt you. I'm sure you already know this and trust your partner, but there is a stereotype out there of schizophrenics being violent people, and that simply isn't true. A diagnosis won't change who your loved one was before. I just wanted to say that.

Anyway, back to more relevant matters. For me, it is admittedly very difficult for anyone to get through the psychosis when I am really going off the rails. The delusions can be very strong, and they have driven me to do some pretty bizarre things! They are also sticky, by which I mean that even though I am medicated and in a relatively good place right now, I still secretly believe some things that most people would find unusual. The important thing is that I can identify this in myself, and chances are that with medication, your SO will be able to do the same thing once things in his head start to fall back into place. Where you come in is with a fact-checker attitude that he can rely on when he isn't sure what's real. I can count on my partner to give me reality checks when I can tell something might not be right in my head, and that is invaluable to me. 

Is your partner forgetful? If so, kindly remind him to take his medication, or ask if that would be something he would have any interest in being assisted with. It can be annoying, but I will admit that someone looking out for me in that way is helpful. 

I wish I could give you better advice for how to cut through the psychosis. I think that the number one thing you can do is be there with open arms and a loving, supportive heart...even when I am at my worst and my most paranoid and distrustful, that tends to eventually crack me and that, in conjunction with a medication change or hospital visit, will put me right again.

I hope anything I said is of use to you. You're a good person for sticking by your SO through all of this. I know that it couldn't have been easy...but it will get better. It could take a little time, but if your partner is as invested in his recovery as you are in helping him, you have nothing to worry about."
schizophrenia,fm93wa4,t3_ftmtsw,1585861231.0,"It is a common misconception by people who are not familiar with psychiatric medications that they will ""change who you are"" or become addictive. These are so common possibly because to a certain extent, there is truth to them...but they are also harmfully false. Let me explain.

Without medication, my life is a living nightmare. More than it is with it, at any rate. I am confused, terrified, paranoid, moody, etc. I believe things that often drive me to suicide. Without medication, which alters my mood and keeps me more grounded in reality, I am a complete train wreck. 

Most psychiatric medications used to treat schizophrenia are not addictive in the traditional sense of the word. You may find that you *need* them to function, but you will not necessarily go through withdrawals if you taper off them slowly with the help and oversight of a trusted psychiatrist. If you stop them suddenly, your symptoms are likely to return in a barrage and no one wants that, so if you do choose medication, try to stick with it unless you're going to replace it with something else. 

Your mother is right to be concerned; there are a lot of medications out there and a lot of side-effects that go with them. It can be a long and puzzling journey to find out which ones are best for you. But if your symptoms become more intolerable than said side-effects (which may or may not even be a thing for you...everybody is different) then there is no harm in giving medication a shot. I have a seizure disorder that I was against taking medication for initially, and I coped with the seizures the best I could without it for a long time. However, after my psychiatrist introduced medication into my life and I saw how things could be with it, I never looked back. Mental illness is no different, and there is no shame in giving medication a try. I hope that you at least consider it, because you *can* quit with relatively little trouble if you decide that it just isn't for you."

Whatever you do, don't roll over and let the side-effects of your medication become unbearable because you feel that you have no right to say anything. If you're anything like me, it can be hard--almost impossible--to do something that might be perceived as bothering anyone else. In a case like this, it doesn't matter. Your health and comfort matters, and it is okay to complain over and over again until they listen. Abilify is not the only medication out there that can be used to treat schizophrenia--not by a long shot. If you advocate for yourself and they listen, you can try some other drug that will hopefully not give you such awful side-effects. 

On another note...I just wanted to say that I'm sorry that you're dealing with this illness so young. My first symptoms started coming through at thirteen, so I know how scary and hopeless it might seem to have to live with this diagnosis. In some ways, it actually does get better, because you learn how to manage the illness better, meet people who understand, and get a better sense of who you are as a human being despite the illness. I'm twenty-five now and am still working on the first and last bits, but I'm way better off than I was before I was diagnosed. At least in the sense that now I know that I can't trust every thought and feeling that comes into my mind.

So, it's best just to be honest.

My second thought is that it's sort of up to you whether or not you believe therapy would be helpful despite not having any major issues to tackle, but if it were me...I might keep going, just so I have a safeguard. I don't know what having schizoaffective is like for you, but for me, the next big issue is always just around the corner, so it's always a good idea for me to have someone there to help me out instead of having to go through the process of finding a new therapist and making an appointment every time the other shoe drops."

I am on the autism spectrum on top of having schizoaffective, and it's easy to let hopelessness get the better of me when my limitations seem endless.

schizoaffective,fklpndy,t1_fklefji,1584311820.0,"I've always been a little forgetful, but since the schizoaffective disorder really started taking off, it's become a problem instead of a quirk. I have a hard time remembering to do basic things sometimes, but when I'm not properly medicated (though the meds definitely make me a little foggy, too) it's like I'm living in a dream and nothing is real. Time slips by without me being able to notice it. Unfortunately, I spend most of my life like this, apparently, because the more recently something happened, the less likely I am to remember it. Which I know sounds completely backwards, but my theory is that my short-term memory is impaired, while my long-term memories are more or less intact. Thus, the memories that were stored before I became sick are all okay, while those that came afterwards are harder for me to drag out of the mist. 

I know that I'm not the only one who experiences this, either. I've done lots of chatting with others with my same diagnoses, as well as research on the illness itself, and have discovered that the memory issues are really, really common, almost to a frustrating degree. If you continue to browse this forum for any amount of time, you'll find people asking if the memory problems are normal, or feeling hopeless because they just aren't as sharp as they used to be. My school performance in college plummeted and has not recovered thanks to my ability to learn properly being compromised, and...well, I digress. The point is that the poor memory your loved one is experiencing COULD be from medication, but it's also really common for schizoaffective people to be confused in that way."
schizoaffective,fkl9w1b,t3_fj634i,1584301678.0,"Firstly, let me just say that I'm glad that you finally have an answer and can move forward with finding ways to cope properly instead of feeling at the mercy of an illness that you don't understand/have a name for. Now, in answer to your questions:

1. I was diagnosed when I was maybe 21 or so? Maybe earlier? It's hard for me to recall, as my illnesses really damage my memory. I've had symptoms since childhood, however, though things didn't really start to go south until I was thirteen. I can go into more detail as to how that looked for me if you are interested. The biggest challenges that being schizoaffective have presented for me are all fairly obvious: I am either depressed, manic, psychotic, or a mixture of the three, and it keeps me from staying in school and maintaining a job. Sometimes, at my worst, I can't even take care of myself and end up in the hospital. I've spent most of the last two or three years away from home in some sort of hospital or program or whatever in an attempt to get everything under control, but I'm still struggling. For me, the illness seems to get worse with age, but this is not true for everyone.
2. Since schizoaffective is a combination of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder or depression, feel free to check out the resources provided on those subreddits--they're actually really useful. I like to read self-help books, and there's even a *Schizophrenia for Dummies* book, so there are TONS of resources out there. However, it's a little harder to find things to read about schizoaffective in and of itself rather than the illnesses that it is composed of, so if you need me to go and find exactly what I've read because you aren't having any luck, just let me know and I can be more specific. 
3. I wish that people would understand how difficult in general this illness is. Which is a really general thing to say, and I realize that, but my situation is a little tough because I come off as a relatively normal, well-adjusted person. That's great and all, but it also makes people not take me as seriously when I am struggling unless I've hit crisis mode, in which case all airs of being ordinary fly out the window and I can't hide what's going on inside my head anymore. 
4. The most helpful my family/friends can be is simply understanding, even when we both know that they can't understand exactly what it's like to be hearing voices and feeling like you are likely going to be abducted by aliens. It annoys me when they ask if I've been taking my medication, but I know that I have a history of forgetting, so I must reluctantly admit that that helps, too. Basically, knowing that there are people by my side who care about me and want to help is the only thing keeping me on this Earth (I'm in a depressive spell at the moment), and that just has to be enough. My partner and mom are also aiding me in signing up for SSI, so things like that are nice as well.
5. Writing, listening to music, and playing music are the only things that I can do anymore. I try to get out of the house at least once a day, but it's not always a good idea for me to go out alone, especially when I'm feeling like this--I might get confused and wander off, or get into trouble and do something impulsive, etc. I am a ghostwriter by profession, though I haven't had any work to do for a while and am essentially, for all intents and purposes, unemployed. 

This is one of the longest replies I've posted in a while, and I apologize for that. I hope that you glean something from what I have written, and don't hesitate to reply or message me directly for more details. I have put my family through hell from having this illness and a few others, and the least I can do is try to help someone else's."
schizoaffective,fkkp4zw,t1_fkkecrv,1584288980.0,"Pretty much the same thing happens to me, too. I guess the psych ward doesn't really do THAT much to keep me safe, though sometimes I do need that supervision and sense of being contained. Talking to my doctor about upping my meds is basically what I'm planning on doing; I wrote him an email yesterday and I hope I hear back soon before things get too wonky. I'm unemployed and working on disability, so I can just hang low until I hear back."

schizoaffective,fkit2eg,t3_fi9kse,1584227962.0,"Thank you for bringing this up, because the same thing is kind of happening to me. I was already falling into a depressive episode, but now it feels a little more psychosis-y due to the fact that everyone is acting like the world is ending. It's like one of my weird fantasies (I've wanted to be around for the apocalypse for a long time, and I can't really explain properly why) has come to life, and that makes everything feel very surreal to me. I realize that what I am experiencing is different from what you're talking about, but COVID-19 is messing a little with my sense of reality and routine, too."
schizoaffective,fdlvyq9,t1_fdej0rk,1578533810.0,"I'm so glad to hear that you're hanging in there, and that you were even happy for a few minutes before the paranoia kicked back up. I can definitely relate to that feeling of blaming yourself for thinking ""crazy"" thoughts. I've come to learn that that comes from being somewhat lucid while you simultaneously battle psychosis, or at least that's what's going on when it happens with me. It's the worst, this dichotomy that exists when the brain fights itself to identify the true reality. For instance, for me the ""crazy"" thoughts can leak in while I'm in a ""normal"" headspace, like the fact that I simultaneously believe that I am an alien trapped in a human body and believe that I have a mental illness that makes me think things like that. I guess what I mean is that I'm aware that I have delusions, but that doesn't necessarily make it easier to not believe in them. Does that make sense? I feel like I'm not being that articulate right now. Anyway, I totally get what you mean by shaming yourself for thinking like someone that the neurotypical community would deem ""crazy."" It feels like you're doing something wrong somehow when you have these thoughts that you can't control, even though it isn't your fault.

It's not your fault, either, that your family can't truly understand what is going on for you. Even if you are the best at explaining your symptoms in the world, it won't make people who have never faced hallucinations and delusions understand them any better, because at best they can imagine what you are describing, which is definitely not the same as going through such experiences themselves. While the imagination can be powerful (as we know) it just isn't the same for neurotypical people who aren't experiencing these issues, so try not to blame yourself when they can't wrap their minds around what you are describing. Really, it is their jobs to be as supportive as they can, even if they can't fully comprehend what you mean, so any negative feedback you are getting is 100% on them, not you. I'm glad that your family is doing the best they can, though. That's all we can really expect.

Sorry my responses are so long! Despite being in a treatment program (it's for an eating disorder, so that's not too helpful for depression or psychosis) and having friends here, it gets lonely sometimes, especially not having any other schizoaffective people here. Or people who have similar symptoms."
sex,fdebmsu,t3_ekl6zx,1578335480.0,"I know what you mean by this. I much prefer cuddling with my partner to having sex right now, though admittedly that's largely because of trauma on my end (not with them, but in a past relationship.) I'm working on it so that I can better satisfy my partner's wants and needs--I don't like to be touched, but am able to and enjoy touching them--but I'm definitely partial to just holding them in my arms afterwards and talking/laughing/falling asleep."
schizoaffective,fdeb0l9,t3_ekwthf,1578335094.0,"I haven't had this experience, but I do know that the feeling of bugs on or underneath the skin (including the scalp) is a thing that some people with psychotic disorders hallucinate about, so believing that you have lice doesn't seem too far off the mark for someone with schizoaffective disorder. Maybe to be positive that it's a delusion, gather up the courage to get it checked out? Although, if your doctor didn't mention anything, maybe you don't have any. I can't pretend to be a lice expert. How's your hygiene? I struggle, myself...I recently started showering twice a week for my partner, which is a step up for me. But my hair/scalp is still relatively healthy, I think. Do you have a profession that might lead you to be exposed to lice? Idk, all things to consider when trying to ground yourself and gather the facts about whether or not something could be real or a delusion."
schizoaffective,fdc8r0j,t1_fcub7rr,1578269318.0,"First of all, sorry that I'm a few days late in responding. I can't remember if I mentioned in my comment that I'm in a treatment program right now, but that takes up a lot of my time, and I don't always have downtime to spend on Reddit (unfortunately.) 

Anyway, from the outside looking in, it's really, really encouraging to hear how much you've thought everything through that I said, pretty much long before I said it. That tells me that even though you feel scared and uncertain, a part of you is grounded and able to make rational deductions and decisions (most of the time), which is very encouraging, even if you do end up with a schizoaffective diagnosis. Based on what you have shared here and shared with me, I can offer my nonprofessional opinion on the matter and say that you might have it, especially with the mood symptoms that you described, which actually *do* fit the diagnosis. I think that you have probably done plenty of research on schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in your search for answers, so you likely already know this, but there are two subtypes of schizoaffective disorder: the bipolar subtype and the depressive subtype. If you were already diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but you also are experiencing all of these other symptoms apart from your mood swings, you may have the bipolar subtype of schizoaffective disorder. The main differentiating factor between bipolar with psychotic features and schizoaffective disorder is that the psychosis can (and most often is) be unrelated to a mood swing, and that sounds, to me, like what you are experiencing. 

I want to validate your fear of yourself, because that is a very real thing and I can relate to it so much. When you feel like you aren't in control of your own brain and you don't know what's coming next, how are you supposed to feel safe from your own hallucinations, delusions, and mood swings? It's impossible. I'm so sorry that this is your reality right now, and I want you to know that you are doing everything right in reaching out and insisting that people listen and give you the help and care that you deserve and need. I'm responding to this three days late, so I don't know if you've chosen to drive yourself down to the hospital by now, but if you have, I think that you're doing the right thing. You can and will find a way to pay off the bill, and your mental health will always be more important than money (though I will acknowledge that the two can be quite connected.)

Finally, I'm sad to hear that your family isn't being receptive about what's going on with you. I don't know your specific situation or what your family members are usually like, but for me...well. Let's just say that I have put my family through a lot, and some of the things I have thrown their way haven't always been easy to believe or swallow. But because they love me and I have medical professionals on my side to validate me and my experiences, they have come around every single time. They don't necessarily believe everything that I believe, and they don't necessarily know everything that I have been through or that happens to me, but I am slowly coming to be at peace with that. I'm not suggesting that you have to, exactly, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that it can get a little better, and you might not always feel as invalidated as you do now.

Anyway, this comment is super long, so I'll wrap it up. I just know how it feels to be trapped in a that terrible space between diagnoses where the world seems like it's falling apart and turning inside out and the people who you need to listen are only kind of listening and only half doing their jobs. I hope that you can get the care you need, and soon, and that you have been able to get some sleep in over the last few days. As we all know, sleep is so important, and insomnia really messes me up, too. I believe in your ability to get through this. Try to take it one hour at a time, one minute at a time, one second. And do whatever you can to stay grounded. Good luck! I'm here if you still want/need to talk."
schizoaffective,fcso9iu,t3_ehmasd,1577920955.0,"All. The. Fucking. Time. And I have lots of reasons why it seems like I'm not sick, and even why not everyone else who is diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder/schizophrenia is, either, but I just have to remind myself that I am off my rocker, or at least that's what I need to believe to be ""safe."" It's been a little while since I last had a psychotic break, but when I'm really struggling with believing that I'm even ill (other than the crippling depression) I just think of the worst one I've ever had, and that grounds me okay. I feel you, though."
schizoaffective,fcsnuz9,t3_ehw63z,1577920669.0,"First of all, I'm sorry that you're experiencing these things. It sounds as though this is an extremely stressful time for you, and, for me, stress only serves to make my symptoms worse. It must be very frustrating to have a medical team who you feel is not listening to you properly or taking you seriously, though I do agree with your psychologist on the level that if you do not have insurance, you should do your utmost to avoid being hospitalized, because it is quite expensive. However, as it sounds like you are quite distressed by your hallucinations and are feeling unsafe, hospitalization might wind up being a good call, just so you can get to a place where you are feeling stable and clear-headed again. I usually leave it as a last resort because it's not necessarily a pleasant experience, but you know what is right for you...until you don't. 

As for whether or not you truly are schizoaffective/have schizophrenia, that's for a psychiatrist to decide. Self-diagnosis can be very tempting, but even medical professionals are not qualified to diagnose themselves with illnesses, mental or otherwise: doctors still have to see doctors. If the professionals in your life are ignoring you or you feel like the diagnosis you have isn't all-encompassing or just plain doesn't fit, it is completely within your rights and power to get a second, third, fourth opinion. Just try to be open-minded about what you are told, because it might not always be something you agree with or want to hear. 

I already suspected that I had schizoaffective disorder when I was diagnosed because I had so many of the symptoms, and I had for such a long time. My former diagnosis was bipolar disorder, but I never quite identified with it because it always felt like it left certain questions unanswered and symptoms unaddressed. Once my psychiatrist identified that I was slipping in and out of psychosis apart from my mood swings, I was diagnosed as schizoaffective. In some ways, it was a relief to be correct/to finally have a name for what I was going through, but it was also extremely disappointing and disheartening because it meant that I had two of the most difficult mental illnesses to treat all rolled into one, and who wants that? Anyway, the point of me sharing that is that if you do end up having schizophrenia, be prepared to be a schizophrenic, if that makes sense. To have that label put on you and associate that term with yourself *means* something, or at least it does to me. You have to be careful who you tell, because people judge us. They might think we're dangerous, or just plain crazy, and that doesn't feel very good. Do your best to have people around you who you can talk to while you go through this, because even though it's been years for me, I still have trouble accepting that this is my life some days.

Anyway, I wish you luck, and, again, I'm sorry that you're struggling. It does get better with the proper medication and care, so don't stop searching for answers, even if you don't find them here."
DimensionJumping,fciwvnt,t1_fch8wpg,1577671751.0,"Not necessarily, no. There are a lot of interesting branches of quantum mechanics that suggest that something like jumping isn't as far-fetched as it might sound like to someone from the outside looking in. If your skepticism comes from a place of interest, I would highly recommend you do some research to delve into the matter just to see what it's all about. As for the two cup method...I will admit that I'm pretty skeptical, myself, of the effectiveness of it, though some people will claim that they've had lots of luck with it. I guess it depends on how much faith you put in testimonials. Anyway, the gist is that you slowly pour water from one cup into another while placing your intent to jump energetically within that water. You then consume the water. The thinking behind this traces back to Law of Attraction-type philosophies, and the finding that humans can make an impact on the molecular shape of water based on the different ""energies"" they put in. I don't know how I feel about the Law of Attraction, personally (by which I mean that I have a hard time taking it 100% seriously, which might sound funny coming from someone who believes that it is possible to jump), but there is at least some scientific evidence behind the water thing, so I guess that the two cup method is theoretically possible, too, even if I don't have that much faith in it, myself. I hope that answers your question a little."

schizoaffective,fblp1dk,t3_ed0542,1576966612.0,"I'm 24 and on my eight leave of absence from university. I am currently in my fourth stay in eating disorder treatment, and three days before I came to this place, I spent four months in a residential/PHP/IOP program for my schizoa in a facility I had been to two three times prior. I can't stay out of some program or hospital for more than a few months at a time, and the most complicated and long-running job I've ever had was as a courtesy clerk/checker at the VONS in my hometown, which lasted for a few months before the ""stress"" ran me into the hospital. I have been more or less unemployed for years, though I do get part-time work as a ghostwriter. I make very little money (usually none at all), am not on SSI yet, and survive off of my parents' insurance and income. I do not currently live with them, but I live with my partner and their mom, who essentially take care of me. My life completely lacks in personal purpose and direction, and the only reason I have made it to this age is because I don't want to cause my loved ones pain by achieving peace through ending my life. I began truly having symptoms when I was 14, though I have had some hallucinations throughout my life. I have so much to be grateful for, and yet I find myself struggling with the motivation and desire to keep on trucking through this difficult existence with this (these, really, since schizoa is not my only issue) disorders that I hate. 

All of this was a very long-winded way of saying that I feel your pain, and if you ever want to talk writing, I'm not going anywhere. I have to sit on a couch for most of the day, anyway, so I would much rather have a new writing buddy than nap all the time."

I'm in the midst of a very persistent depression, and have been in a residential program for it for the last few months. However, they do not treat eating disorders at this place, and I've kind of gone nuts with that. For my ED, it's a free for all, and I kind of want to see how bad I can get. I have no idea why, except that I want my outside to loo like my inside: dead. I love the appearance of more bones etc. that come with restricting and purging, and I like being sick in some ways. However, I'm starting to lose things as a result of my actions. I just came clean with my family about what I've been doing, and it turns out that it was getting pretty obvious to them based on the amount of weight I have apparently lost. I've lost my partner's trust again, and they are constantly on my case now when I visit home about whether or not I've been eating right (which I have not.) I'm also starting to face consequences here at my program, because they explicitly told me that if I act on ED behaviors, I will be kicked out of the housing to avoid triggering others. I am in a trauma subsection of the program here, and I have already been removed from that as a result of what I've been doing.  

I know that I'm rambling a bit, and I guess my point is that yes, I do know how it feels to not want to get better despite, in my case, facing a lot of negative consequences. I just keep telling myself that I'll get a *little* thinner and then I'll consider getting better, as long as it doesn't involve gaining much weight. Ugh.

For instance, I remember during my first year in college, I underwent something very difficult and, because I didn't handle it the way my friends wanted me to, they ditched me. I felt extremely isolated and alone, especially when they wrote an email to me saying that they worried and wanted to talk or something, but it was obvious that they were just trying to make themselves feel better about what they'd done. I wrote a scathing email back and did not speak to them for a long time.

I thought this was how things went down for years, but when I revisit the memory, I have to wonder if things really unfolded the way I thought they did. I actually got so interested in this that I looked up the email waaaaaaay deep in my UCSC email inbox and you know what? That email looked pretty fucking genuine and my response was that of a raving lunatic.

However, that said, when I'm not well or on the proper medication, I start to believe that I am being stalked by shadow people from another universe who are manipulating my ""family"" and ""friends."" Even though I wouldn't describe myself as currently psychotic, I still hold the lingering belief that is kind of like the opposite of yours: that my brain acts as a kind of radio that intercepts peoples thoughts and conversation from this or other realities. I think this because of the voices I hear within my head. I know that they're not my own thoughts because I can picture the people and they aren't in my voice. I can know logically that all of this is most likely part of my illness, but it's still hard to dismiss those thoughts altogether."

schizoaffective,f3rvjg8,t1_f3rujb2,1571092599.0,"I know, it's really bizarre. I am a sweaty person, especially when it's hot out or I'm working out, which I need to up the frequency of, but I do on a regular basis. Even after that, I typically don't shower until the evening, if I do at all (I know, gross) and no one notices."
schizoaffective,f3ru2py,t3_dhwan9,1571091876.0,"This is definitely something I struggle with on a daily basis. I shower roughly once a week unless my partner is around to ""make"" me shower more frequently. I've been told that you would never know that I don't shower much because I don't smell bad; people are usually surprised to learn how much I dislike showering and how I tend to avoid it for as long as reasonably possible."

You must feel really alone, and that's so hard when you're already struggling with such a dangerous disorder. I'm in a similar place right now. I've relapsed (still in denial about it a little, took some effort to write that) and I've been restricting and purging typically multiple times a day, but no one has noticed so far. I'm half glad that I'm still free to lose weight and half dying inside, wishing that someone would see what I'm doing and try to stop me. But like you said, I know that I have to want recovery for myself, and I'm just not there right now. I hate having to hide this from everyone and pretend that I'm fine. I feel like such a phony."

More important than anything is how YOU feel in what you are wearing, not what other people say about it. On days when you feel like you are not looking your best and you are still wearing that dress...that's so brave. I really admire the courage you have to wear something you love even when you feel ugly, because chances are you look a hundred times better than what your brain is telling you. Don't lose that."

schizoaffective,erwifgn,t3_c4a6c2,1561344569.0,"I have an identical problem. I visited an alternate universe last night in my sleep, and discovered that I am unintentionally ruining my other self's life with the pull that our existences exert on each other. I feel really badly about it, but there's nothing I know how to do about it right now. It felt like so much more than a dream. I can tell the difference between a dream and something like this... anyone could. I feel strongly about that. 

&#x200B;

I'm in a place right now where I also know that this is delusional thinking and I'm ashamed of that. I know that I can't talk about what I am or what I experienced last night to anyone, because no one would believe me, and I would literally be punished for opening up. I hate this, this feeling of being a stranger in one's own reality and having no way to get back home."
