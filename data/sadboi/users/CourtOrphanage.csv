It was like the ""I'm still hungry, so I'll eat some of that since it's there"" pizza. I was always puzzled that ""Canadian Bacon"" was never bacon I was used to, but like ham, and I always just assumed that the cooks were making a mistake, for like 10 years, lol. 

I did really like this BBQ pizza that the local chain Italian place had. It had BBQ sauce basically as the base replacing the tomato sauce, grilled chicken, grilled onions, and standard cheese topping. My familly thought that I was crazy. I totally get if other people do not like that shit, but boy I loved it!

So yeah, if people don't like pineapple pizza, who cares haha, you are the one eating it. 

&#x200B;

If you like pineapple pizza... Here is a good food to try. It's called a Jibarito. I had my first one last summer at a first Fridays event when I was living in Las Vegas. A good'ol food truck.

It is a fried Plantain, which was nice, warm and flaky with a nice seasoning salt. The plantain was smashed to the size of a piece of bread and there are two of them. Then they make a nice sandwich with lettuce and tomato, onion, grilled chicken, and the most delicious chipotle mayo. Yummy... The sandwich was warm and slightly sweet from the plantain."

I for one need the additional probiotics a few times a week. I choose kombucha because I'm unable to find organic, full-fat, plain kefir.

Acidophilus is a great source of probiotics to. That you can get plain/unflavored.

But yeah, Kombucha healed my gut pretty quick. I became regular (at the time not carnivore, only gluten free due to celiac...) And my poop smelled different for a few days when drinking it. My stomach felt better and due to my gut starting to heal, my depression got even better, my anxiety got slightly better and my headaches from inflammation due to leaking got got better.

I do think that commercial kombucha since then has gone down the tube. More sugar, almost 2.5-4x more depending on the brand as well as less probiotics in my opinion."

I remember being 4 years old and having the same recurring dreams about my biological mother breaking up with me (which was concept 4 year old me understood, it wasn't romantic or anything, i just thought that was what break ups were) for years to come. For years..."
Parenting,fd0hzkw,t1_fd0fpiz,1578119082.0,"You are correct partially, this may also be different in your state. I'm in Colorado. Normally an APR case (Allocation of Parental Responsibility) address CS and visitation under JV code. They usually do visitation first and CS after. 
However, in my case, which is in Colorado, I was the respondent to the APR case and was pro se momentarily for our Initial Status Conference. Her lawyer knew I was pro se and disregarded my many emails to negotiate a paternity agreement for a JDF 1506 Motion. Her lawyers wanted to establish financials and disregarded the more traditional process of going about an APR case. Which as a pro se litigant, they can do. 
So I filed a CS Case in DHS, to get paternity established on my own. Which gives DHS rights to establish CS before visitation and splits my case in two essentially. 

My lawyer now, is consolidating the DHS case and the JV (visitation) into one JV case now."

For example, Dallas Tx.... Agencies that collect child support, are reimbursed $12 for every $1 collected in child support. They also have some of the lowest custody rates for dads. Why is that? I'll give a theory... You can't collect child support, if parents have 50/50 custody.

Parenting,fd0fcyt,t1_fd09xqd,1578118004.0,"Look, I knew an addict I met in rehab years ago. I kept in touch with him after we got out of rehab. I met his son, daughter, and wife and spent some time with him and his family, dinners and family outings. I didn't know though that he had a history of DV.
One night he relapsed and took off for two weeks, drained the bank accounts, solicited their 16 year old neighbor for sex and returned home valentines day night and beat his wife in a methed out binge. She texted me pictures a few minutes after he beat her up and asked me to come over and call the police. He broke her nose, busted her jaw and left a knot on her head the size of an orange. He had texted her threatening her a few nights prior. 
I showed up, police came, they took statements and pictures and tried to take her to the hospital. He turned himself in about 3 days later, and his parents bailed him out. He had to stay away from her until court which was roughly a month. There were a few times he came by her house but the police couldn't catch him in the act so nothing was done. 
However, the wife was a recovering addict as well who obviously didn't have the best taste in men. 
Closer to the court date, she wanted him back, and I was called to testify. She tried sleeping with me (sending me explicit texts) and rationalizing that he normally wasn't like that, it was the drugs (he broke his ex's rib apparently) and that she needed him for the sake of the family. She tried to get me to not show up to the court date. Nope. I don't mess with that. I'm going.

Anywho, she didn't show up to the court date, there was pretty overwhelming evidence that he beat the tar out of her. The judge called her name in the court room, looked around the court for about 15 seconds and dismissed the case. I was shocked. He walked out of court, and she was waiting for him in the car.

She's dead now. That's all I know. I fully expected him to go to jail. But they nonchalantly let him go and didn't to the ""states picking up the charges against him if she didn't show up"" type stuff you see elsewhere. This was Denver County...
DV stuff is a crapshoot. I've seen dudes get DV cases for having low blood sugar and slamming a door, while others do way more and nothing happens. 

The Deluth Model is what police officers are trained in. Legally if there is ever a domestic dispute, they must remove one of the parties from the premises and take them to jail, which is usually the male. Usually they will slap charges on him, because well, it costs them money to do all that. It's really sad to read about...

My judge didn't give a fuck... All he saw was a groveling puppy dog eyed white girl vs. an irritated, pre-aliented, desperate brown guy sitting in front of him."
Parenting,fd0bvtq,t1_fd07oux,1578116626.0,I assume she would read these when she was older anyways. Like 18 or 20. I wouldn't expose her to something like that if I kept my rights. My goal wouldn't be to plead my case on me vs. her mother or try and sway her. Actions speak for themselves anyways. She can come to her own conclusions. It just might take awhile.

What is it you suspect that I did or are lying about in regards to my story to illicit where I am currently at in my court battle? I haven't been denying visitation, we are still establishing that. The delay in time is because of me being on probation+not knowing I could file for visitation earlier+ and lack of $ in obtaining legal counsel. I tried seeing the child, and co-parenting with my ex before this court case was opened. She gave me the run around. Now, we are in court. We will establish visitation. 

I can send you a copy of the supnoa of her filing the restraining order. In it she states ""CourtOrphanage has never been verbally or physically abusive towards me"" on one of the questions on initial form she filed. So what is it that is making me a scumbag other than me trying to rationalize with her and her family being misconstrued as harassment? 

Please, in your 30+ years of expertise, and legal savant-ness enlighten me. Pro-tip she has BDP and severe daddy issues. Maybe you can have a brain blast and remember people you've seen in your experience and do some social algebra on what my ex could be going through.

Once paternity was established, DHS called two days later asking foe CS. My response was ""don't you have to establish visitation to accurately asses CS payments?"" The response from the DHS case worker was ""We don't handle visitation. That is handled in the courts."" I replied ""I haven't even met my daughter yet.""

First off… She begged me for a child about a month into our relationship. She also was very adamant on running off and getting married. We only dated about 3 months. These were huge red flags, but I continued dating her against my better judgment. It turns out that she has BPD which is hard to suss out when you are being love bombed in such a short period of time, and you are thinking with your pecker…

Now, I have correspondence documented fully from that time period. I have all of our text transcripts, where she is constantly asking to have a child because “I have baby fever” and “grandma \*\*\*\* thinks we should have a baby. I don’t want her to die without meeting our baby.” and many sentiments about eloping. Not only that I have many text messages (all in transcripts) to two of my close friends during that time period asking for advice on what to do about her trying to coerce me into inseminating her during intercourse. All of these transcripts have been given to my lawyer and they will be called as witnesses. 

Second, please do some digging on Title IV D and IV E funding. I understand that you and I pay a % as a fee to DHS. However, counties are reimbursed by the Federal Government for collecting child support. A close friend of mine, named Michael Combs, is making a documentary on this issue called “Cash & Prizes: Why Marriage Is Ending In The West.” Please visit his YouTube Channel if you would like to learn more and can watch his interviews with Warren Farrell, family court lawyers, DHS workers, and fathers. I’ve also spoken to some of these lawyers personally and have had them explain many aspects of my case to me ad nauseum. I cannot afford these lawyers for myself, however. 

As far as the harassment piece goes. These were family member that I knew. I worked for my exes grandmother and have been to her home a handful of times before. Now, this can be a difference of opinion, but going to someone’s home and asking to speak with them about the situation isn’t harassment. The grandmother and I had a cordial conversation about the matter. It wasn’t until my ex showed up, got pissed that we were talking, then filed for a TPO a week later on the grounds that I was “stalking” and “harassing” her family. It’s all about how you look at it. 

Now getting a restraining order is not hard. My ex filed for a TPO. I have the original subpoena with me. She used buzz words like “scared” and “harassed” and “stalk” which is a good start. During our court date I said my piece to the judge. The judge asked my ex why she wanted a TPO. Her response, I shit you was not “I, uh, just like, need a break.” The judge stated that “things happen” and “relationships are tense when babies are involved, and break ups happen” then granted the TPO as a “cooling off period.” It’s not hard to get slapped with a TPO. The problem is, I sent her an email (which is discussed in my other posts) a few weeks later (which I didn’t know I wasn’t allowed to do) and got put on probation for Violation of A Civil Protection Order for one year. Being on probation added about 7 months to the TPO. 

In addition to this, at the time, my lawyer J\*\*\* Goddamn Sullivan ( I was broke) advised me that I could do nothing during probation or the TPO in regards to my child until I was off probation. I was under the impression that I legally couldn’t do anything until off probation. Little did I know, I could have filed much, much sooner and start the process of parental rights, and visitation, despite being on probation. 

As far as 16 Months goes, my daughter was 8 months old when I started trying to speak with my ex about the child. 

As far as cooperating with her goes. Did you even read the post? She got pregnant, then pulled the chute. I understand that this makes me look like a nefarious asshole who must have done-goofed-up really hard or have been a super crappy as a boyfriend. I did everything I could to try and cooperated and come to an agreement. My IG messages are chalked full of me trying to find a balance and compromise with something that worked for me and her. She shat on it every time. If you would like the screenshots, or the JSON code of our IG chat history, I’d be happy to send you redacted versions of our transcripts. 

I’ve spoken with her stepmother, who stated that she was privy to my ex’s sentiments to use me as a sperm donor. I have transcripts of that, as well as phone recordings of her stating that (I record every phone call, it’s legal in my state.) Her stepmother, also stated that my ex, has alienated her father as well. My ex didn’t see her father from age 13 to 19. At 19, she came back around a handful of times. Christmas of 2018, my ex brought the baby over, stood by the tree and grabbed her gifts and left without saying anything after about 15 minutes. There is a pattern of disfunction following her and her mother.

I know this looks super shitty and that I must be guilty. Honestly, my ex is a really unhealthy person who has BPD and is extremely good a manipulating people, who hates taking responsibility. Her mother enables her and has an Oedipal complex who will do anything for her if it means that my ex won’t leave her mother the way her father did, for a woman that was 20 years younger. 

I’m not perfect. I have a past. I was a drug addict for 4 years (pain pills, benzo’s, weed, booze). I did a yearlong rehab program and was homeless for about 2 years. My adoptive family and I haven’t spoken in ages due to how bad my addiction was.

I’ve been sober 5 years and 4 months on the 12th of this month. I’m 25 now. I have no degree. I struggled with severe depression and anxiety for years. All of which I confided in my ex about. But when shit hit the fan, I didn’t know that all the things I shared with her about myself, would be weaponized as if it was relevant now.
