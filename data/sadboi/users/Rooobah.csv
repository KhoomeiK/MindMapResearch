I informed myself on it on Google to the point that i knew i shouldn't be in Google anymore because it was hurting me. Hocd is a ocd and ocd is an anxiety disorders. Anxiety feeds on fear. First stop googling uf you are doing it. Second, please seek professional help from a therapist and medication, they are awesome and they do work. And, take this from me, it is 100% possible for you to heal and leave this behind for good! That's happy news! Smile!

Get some help from a professional therapist. They're awesome. Not perfect. But very very helpful. I've been in your place about three years ago. It's gone now! Poof! Gone! Over time.

But over time i understood that I'm very different from a gay guy. I love women's body. I'm aroused by them. They are fucking awesome, just as men. But i let go of my fear, i trued to stop checking. ""So what if I'm gay?"" Was what i said to myself and it did scare the shit out of me. But eventually it didn't. and My hocd was severe.
I didn't take medication to overcome it though. 
There was a point that i felt like i couldn't stand being in public, there were men and women , both truggers, but i did go to public, shaking, feeling nasuea , sry for my english. Feeling like throwing up un the subway because there were too many attractive men there, fear hada holdof me back then. I'm going on a second date with a wonderful guy tonight. I'm happy.

I took Google's advice, i mean other people sharing stories. You see, ocd is all fear. And fear is the most terrible human emotion. The only power hocd has over you is your fear of it. You need to sit with it. Feel sick. But go through it. Reach the root of your fear. Are you religious? Are you afraid of hell? Do you feel like you can't have a wonderful life if you're bisexual or gay? Do you feel ashamed? Are you afraid what your loved ones will think?
You can't let your fear control you. You are in control. You don't have to do this alone. There is help. See a therapist. Medication could help you, look at it as a little boost, a little help. Just laugh at the fear. It's gonna go away. It's just a feeling and it's gonna go away pretty soon. I assure you. I'm an example."

Talk about it with someone. Straight men have gay experiences all the time. It's not that shameful. Talk about it with a therapist. Know that it's just a fear.
