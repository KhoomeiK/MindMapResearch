Chang_Gang,fqg3a82,t3_gi4hh3,1589337062.0,"Uchiha was one of the main characters that got me hooked on GTA RP. I first met him when he was speaking with Mother, I was dying laughing. Cyr himself turned out to keep me even more hooked. He's hilarious and so chilled out (other than when he rages but I still love it). Being part of his community is also so enjoyable and has zero toxicity. Thanks again, as always, for being such a nice part of my day."

Things are going well in terms of being compliant. Have 100% stuck to my planned meals, but had a Chipotle 'Whole30' bowl one day and felt fine after eating it (chipotle was a weird weakness of mine but I always felt like shit after eating it... clearly there were some ingredients in their burritos that don't work for me, excited to find out what it probably was during re-intro). One thing I'm not doing perfectly is eating three meals at scheduled times each day. I usually wake up late and miss breakfast. The first week I had boiled eggs ready to go, so that was easy. I think it really diminished my appetite as well, because a lot of nights I'd just not be hungry, but would make myself eat the prepared food anyway.  About a week and a half in, I started craving again and getting restless about my food choices. Today was better. Just made a mexican chicken soup with lots of green veggies.

I don't notice a huge, stark change yet. However, my energy is coming back a bit. In the first week I had a couple of very tired days. I also notice my stomach is less restless, so that's positive. My skin has been ok in the past with minor breakouts every once in a while. But yesterday I got two new pimples!! I don't quite understand why, but maybe it's part of a detox of sorts?

Either way, I still trust in whole30 and really think it's a wonderful thing for me to do for myself. Doesn't have to be some hugely stark difference all at once. I'm proud of myself for finally sticking to a meal plan after so long of telling myself I would!"
whole30,flc5inz,t3_fn0wqs,1585020446.0,"I'm almost half-way through R1. The first week was easy, but the past few days have been a bit more 'annoying'. I'll see sweets/baked goods at the store and I'll get p-o'd cause I think about how yummy it would be. But I'm sticking through of course!  I hope cravings start to subside again in the last two weeks of this. Trying to always have delicious fruit on hand, that helps. Also ready with compliant snacks just in case I really need something to take my mind off of other foods."
whole30,fl66rpx,t3_fkql4x,1584856338.0,"I'm at R1, about 1.5 weeks through. I found at the end of my first week I had a much lower appetite, which is something I welcome mostly, but it was strange feeling like I needed to make myself eat even though I didn't really feel like it. I'd usually have boiled eggs for breakfast every day, but dinnertime I had to make an effort to put food in my body even though I had delicious meals planned out. I just didn't feel hungry. However I did have a couple of days during this where I was quite tired during the day.

 Now, about 5 days later my appetite seems to be returning to something a bit more normal. I've always had a hard time with breakfast because I'm always rushing in the morning but I try to eat something most days during Whole30. Anyway, this is all good because before this I was binging and getting food for delivery a lot, so I don't mind it at all. It's just interesting to witness that shift of no control over appetite, to a very natural lack of obsession over eating. It's getting a bit harder at a week and a half but I'm confident that I can stick with it."
whole30,fktcygl,t3_fk0v96,1584514414.0,"Almost at R1D7, a week in. Things are going well. It seems weird that I'm already having a drastic change in appetite. After my first meal of the day I hardly have any appetite even though I'm prepared with delicious compliant food at my fingertips. I don't want my food to go to waste so I make an effort to eat each meal that I have planned. I was very tired the past two days, not sure if that's normal but I seem to rembeber reading that it is. I think I will be able to complete the 30 days despite the chaos. I am able to find ingredients still. Luckily we can't have pasta, because that's totally gone from every store ðŸ˜‹. Excited to see more benefits as time goes by!"
whole30,fkd7vm1,t3_fhcdy2,1584070646.0,"R1D2. Things are going well. The meal planning I did for this first week has worked out wonderfully so far. It's so easy to grab my next meal and not have to stress about it. Been having berries every day for dessert and made some delicious homemade apple sauce.  I also have carrots and Primal Kitchen dressing to dip them in just in case I'm still hungry after my meals. Things are looking like they will go well this month as long as I meal plan each week! Haven't noticed significant changes since its only day two, but psychologically I'm feeling much better than I have been just because I'm proving to myself that I can make changes when I really persevere."

swtor,fhwuw3y,t3_f3u27t,1581931448.0,"Mine is really simple and not fleshed out at all, but i have an outline of a basic story that helps me guide all my decisions for my two main characters.

They are twin sisters whose parents died or disappeared in some sort of disaster, and they were separated at an early age. 

One sister, Johanaa was taken in by the Jedi and became a Jedi Counsular. She is pragmatic most of the time and believes in balance, acceptance, and redemption for those who fall to the dark side. She likes to avoid violence and conflict wherever possible and to solve conflict by communicating instead. If she were to ever see her sister again, she would be heartbroken to see what she's become and would do everything she could to save her. She carries this out in in how she treats everyone, even Sith and those who seem irredeemable. This is probably why she has become so close to Arcann, who must make her think about her sister.

The other sister, Anikxa, was sold into slavery and eventually became a Sith Inquisitor. She is filled with rage at her treatment after the turmoil of losing her parents. She blames her sister and believes that she was abandoned by her. She has no care for the Empire or Republic and wants destruction for both. She only cares about amassing more and more power, and will only spare people if she believes they can be of use to her. She demands complete subservience from all she meets as she intends to rule over everything one day. Unfortunately, she is so far gone and consumed by rage that if she met her sister again one day there is .001% chance she would spare her sister either. She'd go mad with rage and they'd have to fight to the death.

At first it was just TSH, but since that was high they did additional tests and when I was called I was told that T3 and T4 were in normal range. I asked them to send me the results so that I could see for myself. I'll be getting those in the mail soon.

I can't imagine I have Hashimoto's, but I don't really fully understand the science behind it. Would I have more issues with my immune system? I don't get sick very often (other than the other annoying hypo-like symptoms)."
