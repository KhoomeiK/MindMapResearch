BPD,ffwveog,t1_ffvv3l7,1580311900.0,I would be very upset. He shouldn't be commenting on anyone's looks except yours but I think it's pretty innocent on his part since he told you he said it to her. I wouldn't be too worried about his verbiage. Pretty and beautiful can be interchangeable to some people. I think he needs to take your feelings into consideration. I would ask him too how he would feel if the roles were reversed and you called some guy handsome or good looking. I bet he wouldn't appreciate it.

He accuses me of not being willing to work on our problems as a result. Because what happens is I will take time to calm down, and then expect things to be normal/okay once my tantrum (idk what else to call it) subsides. He wants to talk about the issue at hand and revisit the situation, but I dont because I know I'll get upset/hurt/mad all over again.  I know most the issues we have are ""me"" issues and don't really have to do with him or anything he's done wrong. But he doesn't get it at all. He wants me to calmly discuss things but I just can't. I've tried and my voice starts shaking and then I cry and get into negative thought loops.

Do you feel like over time your relationships have gotten better in the sense that you don't blow up anymore and walk away?"

AskReddit,f8sl61h,t1_f8shwt3,1574783380.0,"I don't think love is neccesarily a ""feeling"". Love is sacrifice and working through problems because you care for the other person (as long as things aren't abusive then yeah I wouldn't attempt trying to work through that). 

Communication is everything. But it isn't necessarily bad to date casually either and it sounds like that might fit you best since you aren't looking to settle down but it's good to make that clear from the beginning. And it's quite possible you just haven't found the right person yet. 

Do you feel like you're looking more for sparks and attraction? I have a close friend who is like this. She gets extremely bored and restless when the relationship gets too comfortable or the other person falls in love with her.
