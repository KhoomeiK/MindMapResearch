hoggit,fqm9igo,t1_fqm93w5,1589473773.0,Oh I forgot to mention that your phone needs to have a magnetometer and gyroscope in it. Most new phones these days have them both but you need them so they can relay the phone position to the computer. Just take your time setting up the mapping and messing with the settings and you'll get it üëç
hoggit,fqm8pk9,t1_fqm4aba,1589473392.0,Mine was too. You really gotta fine tune the mapping and mess with the pitch yaw and roll axis settings. It took me like 2 hours to get it right

hoggit,fqm8gza,t1_fqm3s6y,1589473280.0,Yeah I was getting a bunch of drift at first but I managed to mostly rid myself of it by spending a good amount of time messing with the mapping. I still drift a little but not enough to really bother me
