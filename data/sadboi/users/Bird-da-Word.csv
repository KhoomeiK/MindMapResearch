Then if that betrayal wasn't enough, your partner cheats on you...  And not just any partner I might add...your first and only...  That must hit especially hard.

Quite literally, one of the basic human needs is attention.  In one of the all time most famous psychology experiments conducted (Harlow's monkey experiment - I urge you to look this up!!) monkeys were given a choice of a wire monkey and food or a stuffed animal monkey with no food.  Literally all of them chose the stuffed animal monkey without food.  Because we, as primates, as animals, crave attention from our parents.  Our family.  We would quite literally go without food for a while than be starved of attention.  And from what it sounds like you were starved from attention for years and years now.  Unbeknownst to your parents, they failed to realize that they never paid enough attention to you, something you growing up so desperately craved.  Your dad to truly listen to how your day was without immediately diverting his full attention to your brother.  Your mum to actually question you concerningly when she noticed your self harm.  Things like that.  And lacking that - anyone would feel empty and depressed!  It literally all makes perfect sense.  I'm so, so sorry you've been deprived of something so essential to human development and want you to know that there is a reason why you feel the way you do :)"
SuicideWatch,fl88ck0,t1_fl86n0u,1584918010.0,"Haha you're pretty smart yourself - currently getting to it, actually.  Quick story - I was bullied for 10+ years as well.  Beaten up, called ugly daily, everything.  I say this in no way to compare my situation to yours (I couldn't possibly) but just to let you know that I have some experience here - I too know what it's like to hate myself with all of my heart.  

I want you to try something my friend.  While it's a gradual process, it made me go from suicide attempts and cutting and true feelings of worthlessness to loving myself (over the years) and never wanting to lay a finger on me again.  

Talk to your inner self.

I know how stupid it sounds.  How dumb.  How embarrassing.  How childish.  But it fucking works.  Our brains are extremely neuroplastic - what that means is that our synaptic connections can be made - and also unmade - and then remade - all over again.  I want you to talk to your inner self.  Whenever you get one of those thoughts, saying that you are worthless, ugly, fat, dumb, useless, etc.  Which I'm sure will occur pretty often.  Say ""Of course I feel ugly.  Of course I feel fat.  Of course I hate myself.  Of course.  Of course.  Of course.  There's a reason why I feel this way.""  And then go through the reasons why you feel that way, remembering all the bullying, abuse, rape, everything.  

But then, I want you to say, ""I love you.  I care about you.  I appreciate you.  Of course I feel this way, but listen to what I'm saying now.""  You are quite literally remaking the synaptic connections within your brain.  In other words, you are quite literally removing all those old stones that comprised your sculpture and replacing them with new ones.  New ones saying, ""I love you,  I care about you.  I appreciate you.""  Each and every time you experience one of these negative emotions, so I'm sure it will become a big part of your day.

This form of therapy will take time.  It will not resolve all of your issues.  But over time, if consistent, you will quite literally notice a reduction in the frequency of those negative thoughts and an uptick in the positive ones.

After all, there was a reason why, my friend, you never fit in with that incel crowd.  Why you felt pressured to pretend to hate women.  You've just never been allowed to express - or even to see - that good side of you.  Use that as a foundation, and build yourself up from there :)"
depression,fl86i2c,t1_fl85zq7,1584916894.0,"Thanks for this!  It really does lend some new light into your situation here.  What you have said absolutely makes sense, and I'm glad you haven't done it too recently.  One thing I you said two comments prior that stuck out to me was that you don't talk to your family much because none of the really respect you.  Could you elaborate more on that for me just so I can understand better?"
SuicideWatch,fl8646a,t1_fl853lu,1584916664.0,"Actually, neither, haha.  I am certainly not telling you that you need to start loving yourself.  Why?  Because I'm sure that so many people have *tried* to tell you that over the years.  And with the amount of abuse you've sustained, of course it would come of as next to useless to you!  But I'm also not telling you that you need to die.  Rather, I'm saying I 100% understand why you *want* to die, given everything I've read so far, and while I get it - it still saddens me nonetheless to see you in this much pain.  

You know, one interesting thing my therapist told me years ago was that we each have an inner self.  An inner person.  An inner child.  And without knowing it, we communicate to our inner self.  All the time.  For instance, when you say you hate your looks and weight a dozen times a day like you mentioned above, you are really talking to your inner self.  And in doing so, you try to put as much space as possible between you and your inner self.  In other words, you try to put as much space between you, and the sculpture of the woman (representing your inner self) as possible.  And do you know why you do this?  Because your inner self is comprised of all those stones.  All those hurtful/traumatic/scarring/terrible things people did/said to you over the years.  All of them.  So of course you want no part of a person who represents all those things.  Disgusting, fat, ugly, weak, clumsy, dumb, slow, immature, violated, damaged goods, waste, undeserving, worthless, useless...  All of them.  Who in their right mind wouldn't distance themselves from that?  

Are you with me so far my friend?  :)"
depression,fl84y3i,t1_fl83cwm,1584915963.0,"Don't worry - I'll definitely be staying far away from any and all cliches or dumb suggestions.  As someone who self-harmed for many years, I know that those don't work.  But what I am curious about, my friend, is the reason for your self harm.  A lot of people self harm because they hate themselves, and feel like they deserve to be punished.  Or some people self harm because they feel so empty, they need to feel something, at long last, regardless of whether it's painful or not.  Or some other people self harm to escape, however briefly and momentarily, something going on in their lives.  So with that being said, can I ask why you, yourself, resort to self harm?"
SuicideWatch,fl84nal,t1_fl82ybz,1584915784.0,"*I think if it was just the constant childhood abuse, I'd make it. I think if it was just the bullying, I'd make it.

If it was just the social anxiety and awkwardness, I'd make it. If it was just the self-harm, I'd make it.*

You know, this part of a post of yours hit me pretty hard.  I'm beginning to understand just why you had five attempts.  Why you hate yourself so much.  Because - you were never given the chance to love yourself.  Everything you did at school - you were nitpicked, analyzed, and put in the spotlight for.  That is - if you weren't being picked last, or trampled over, or forgotten.  And at home, with the abuse there too.  And therapists who only have seemed to throw cliches your way.  Medications that have not worked.  Attempts that have failed.  And all the while you must feel like you're still stuck with yourself, and only yourself, as you will never find anyone else in this world.  My friend, I am so, so sorry.  Of course you want to die!  Of course you would have nightmares about never getting a girl!  Of course...of course you self-harm!  Of course you despise yourself!  Remember that stone sculpture example I said in the beginning?  That sculpture of the woman is comprised of a thousand different words that say ""Disgusting, fat, ugly, weak, clumsy, dumb, slow, immature, violated, damaged goods, waste, undeserving, worthless, useless...""  It could go on and on.  And the thing is - that sculpture is not complete.  It grows.  And continues to grow.  With each and every new insult slung your way, it continues to grow.  And I'm sure that a lot (if not all) of the bullies have moved on by now.  But what hasn't moved on my friend - is yourself.  You, yourself, have become your own worst bully.  You continue to bully yourself because that's literally all you were taught to do!  At school - and at home!  You literally know no other life.  It's all that has been relentlessly and cruelly drilled into you - for so long.  And as that statue gets bigger and bigger (as your insecurities and self-hate continue to grow) you distance yourself further and further away from it.  In other words, you distance yourself further and further away from your inner self.  Because you can not stand the person whom you are. 

I'm sorry, my friend, for everything.  And most of all, I'm sorry for my most recent comment.  Of course you didn't know what to say!  You've said it all already!  And I should have picked up on how much that means to you, how much it hurts you, and I'm sorry that I didn't right away.

depression,fl82g96,t1_fl81zu5,1584914490.0,"Got it!  Sounds to me it's like just the last straw - the very thing that pushes you over the edge.  And it's a steep drop down.  Usually when this anger arises you are dealing with so much already.  Battling so much - or so little - in your mind.  Trying with all your might to muster up some energy just to fake it a little bit longer.  And then it's completely understandable why something that seems so trivial to anyone else - would just be that last straw that pushes you to the edge, unleashing all that anger.  Because you've had it pent up all throughout the day :(  

I'm sorry to hear that the questions you've received have not helped, either.  While people may mean well, often times the effect their questions had was definitely not intended.

You also said, in a few of your recent posts, that you get random flashes of anger, although it seems like you can do an excellent job concealing it when around others.

Trying to debate you on the incel topic.  Trying to prove you wrong.  Trying to convince you that you don't have to die.  You must be so damn sick of it by now my friend.  I know I sure as hell would be lol.

You know, I wonder if being involuntarily celibate feels safe to you.  Let me explain.  At school, you were mercilessly bullied, for years, it seems.  At home, which is supposed to the one safe haven in the world, you also suffered abuse there, too.  I don't know who raped you, but I can't even begin to imagine just how violating, disgusting, and shattering an act of that nature must be to endure.  And the trauma from that, having to relive it over and over in your mind, must have made no place feel safe.  But on here, with other incels, they were the first group who accepted you for you are.  They didn't try, like we said above, to debate you, convince you, sway you, shake you.  No - they welcomed you in - probably giving you the first safe refuge you'd ever had in your life.  For once, you realized, you were not all alone.  And I can absolutely see why anyone who has been through the horrors you've had to endure would absolutely accept such an invitation.

I know I and many others have taken solace in this approach before.  I read a bit through your post history and it seems like you have endured this for so, so long now.  This boringness, emptiness, mundaneness, everything.  Can you remember a time when you had motivation, when the glass was more filled up, etc?"

And I'm actually only all too familiar with the incel mindset.  Believe it or not, I considered myself ""incel"" for several years.  Mostly because I was bullied for years and years and called ugly all throughout my life.  So at the very least I won't debate you on the incel topic, and I'm sorry that you are not at ease with your appearance :(  It's something that so many people downplay, but it plays an enormous part in our feelings of self worth and self esteem.

SuicideWatch,fl7vq0d,t1_fl7uud1,1584910403.0,"You know, I get the feeling that this girl here, is made out of stones.  Let me explain.

Each time you suffered family abuse, certain types of stones were added to the sculpture.  When you were raped, certain types of stones were added to the sculpture.  When you tried to better yourself through years of therapy, medication, and working out, certain types of stones were added to the sculpture.  And each time your family abused you, certain types of stones were added to the sculpture.  

So what we have, then, in the end, is a sculpture comprised of a thousand different small stones, forming the shape of a girl.  And each stone has something written on it - whether it says ""Disgusting,"" ""Worthless,"" ""Failure,"" ""Violated,"" or a hundred other names.  You, of course would know better than I.  And so you won't even go near the sculpture now, as you can't bare the sight of seeing the writing on those stones.  And I don't blame you for that.  At all - with what you've lived through...

Well, the thing is, there is a difference between suicidal thoughts and suicidal intent.  What you are describing here is suicidal thoughts, where you actively picture you harming and killing yourself, but elsewhere have no explicit desire or intentions to do so.  What this usually means is that our body is speaking to us in metaphor - in which it is trying to kill off a certain aspect - a certain part - of ourselves.  In other words, it is telling us that something needs to change - no matter how small, or inconsequential, it may appear to be upon first glance.  The fact that they occur so frequently and robustly signals to me that something seriously is wrong within your life - although it doesn't sound like you can quite pinpoint that right now - which is the source of your stress and your feelings of undeserving.

When you mentioned the hair on your head not acting normally and ripping it out, it hit me hard.

But true love in the sense that she listened with all her heart and truly cared.  And you crave that.  You got addicted to that.  How could you not?  Because for the first time in your life you had experienced what it felt like to have a properly-nurturing family.  In that girl.  Of course it's fucking hard.

A hug.  Something so simple, and something so small, as a damn hug.  From one of your parents.  Perhaps a brother or sister.  Someone.  Anyone.  And your friend there, the girl who left you, she gave you the next best thing - someone that truly showed an interest.  Which is why it hit you so hard when she left you, because you went back to nothing.  And that must have made you want to die all over again, I'd imagine.  My friend, I'm so sorry you've had to endure so little attention over the years.  It's no wonder you always have felt worthless and useless, despite so many saying how attractive, sociable, and funny you are.  It all makes perfect sense, and I'm so sorry about that..."

Where one feels comfortable saying things that he/she would not dare even mention to others such as friends and whatnot.  But my friend, you never had that.  You never had a brother or sister by the sound of it whom you were extremely close to.  You never had parents who you felt comfortable around to open up with.  You never had family who paid much attention to you.  Separated by all those years from your brother and sister - and even more form your parents - you must have felt like the odd one out in the family I'd imagine.  Always.  Always since you were a kid.  Which is why you felt the need to fake it.  To pretend that you belonged.  To pretend that you felt loved.  So it's no wonder you constantly seek attention!  I'm sure your whole life you thought you were just an attention-seeking whore, and you hated yourself for that.  But you said it yourself!  Your brother and sister call you what...once every two months??  If you're lucky?  That's it!  And your parents, so far removed in their old age, don't seem to be paying too much attention to you either!  I don't blame you for always feeling ignored, never truly heard, never truly loved.  I wonder if sometimes you wonder if you were a mistake...  That must hit hard. ...  The point to all this my friend, is that there is a reason why you seek so much attention, there's a reason why you feel so lonely, there's a reason why you always feel ignored, because those small groups at school can in no way make up for what you've lacked at home all these years.  And I'm so, so sorry for all of it.  How does it feel to hear all this?"

SuicideWatch,fkrgbch,t1_fkrfm19,1584468305.0,"So basically ERP therapy (Exposure and Response Prevention) intentionally exposes you to the perceived threat by your mind, and then trains you not to react.  For instance, let's say I was afraid of touching a toilet handle.  If I were to touch it, then I would have to go through an entire ritual of washing and cleaning my hands and body.  However, in ERP, a therapist carefully guides you as you touch that toilet seat - confronting that fear head on - and then doesn't allow you to do your normal rituals.  And in that safe and controlled environment, you will see that nothing bad happens.  Instead of reacting, you are trained to let the compulsive thought (the need to touch that toilet seat) flow through you, like a cloud.  Let it just linger there, in the back of your mind, until you get bored of it, and it dissipates.  That is the essence of the therapy and the goal of it - to become bored of the thought - to the point where you can merely laugh it off.

ACT on the other hand teaches you to apply ERP when needed.  For instance, say I happen to simply look at the toilet handle.  The mere glance is probably enough to cause me some anxiety, at the very least.  And then I'll ruminate for a while about it, and how hard everything is all the time.  ACT teaches you to avoid that rumination, that dwelling on the toilet handle, and instead directly apply ERP, where you let the thought of the dirty toilet handle simply linger in the back of your mind, until you are bored of it.

My friend, I highly recommend that you find yourself another therapist - or at the very least, do some research on ERP and ACT.  I've suffered from OCD for many years, and the only reliable way to address it is through these two therapies.  I just hate to see you suffer so much to the point where you want to die.  But I understand why you say this, and just want to let you know that there do exist other manners of treatment out there :)"
SuicideWatch,fkrfmcj,t1_fkrew9v,1584467904.0,"This kind of reminds me of a classic quote that I heard once - The happiest people we know are actually the most sad :(  And I don't judge you, one bit, for losing interest in your family.  I feel like you might be a bit worried about people's reactions to you saying that?  But then again, maybe you're in so much pain by now that you are already past that point.  So I know it's rather personal, and if you don't want to tell me it's completely fine, but can I inquire just what it is about your family that you don't like?  

And I just want to let you know how sorry I am that you have had to fake it all these years.  You must be constantly exhausted - I'd imagine returning back to your room at the end of the day must be such a relief in a way - where you can just exhale and let it all out?"

Yet despite that, you still seek out attention all the time.  So let me ask you this then, my friend.  Do your parents give you a lot of attention at home?  Because earlier you told me that you don't feel comfortable opening up to them as they wouldn't understand.

Also, you said that you being sociable and funny is in large parts a mask you wear in order to fake it.  My other question would then be - why fake it?  What are you hiding / hiding from?  :)"

And like you've said, you've tried so much, so so much, and been unable to alter your circumstances - or your destiny - even the slightest bit.  No wonder you hate yourself - if I had to feel lonely, worthless, and unloved on a daily basis I would do the same!

SuicideWatch,fkpdapz,t1_fkpagpx,1584407396.0,"You know, my therapist once told me that we all have an ""inner child"" inside of us.  An inner voice.  Someone we talk to, whether it be consciously or not.  And at first, I'll be honest - I didn't believe him.  I actually laughed at how stupid it sounded in the moment.  But, as time went on, and I progressed with my therapy, I realized just how true those words are...

My friend, this demon, is your inner child.  He is there for you when you are sad.  You guys fight.  Then hug and make up.  Talk and communicate back and forth with each other.  And when you try to socialize he tells you to revert to loneliness because you are just going to end up bothering others.  And when you want to feel happy, he likewise pulls you back...just like when you want to feel loved.  Know that this is completely normal to have an inner voice like this, but the fact that you expressed it as a ""demon"" instead of a ""child"" shows me the overall negative effect he has on you.  

So naturally my friend, I have a few more questions for you haha.  The thing about inner voices, is that they cannot just make up random stuff about you.  For example, mine used to call me dumb and worthless, because people called me dumb and worthless.  Yours makes you return to loneliness, because people told you that your presence bothered them at one point, correct?  Similarly, yours says that you are not destined for happiness or love, because you've been depressed for so long and unable to find love, as seen with what happened with your girl there, correct?

On one hand, you don't have to hurt anymore, and on the other, you won't be causing any others unnecessary pain.  For being a burden.  For making them frustrated as you push them away when they are only trying to help.  Instead, you will temporarily cause them a brief stint of pain by your disappearance, and then they will move on, better off without you in your mind.

I don't blame you for wanting for thinking that this is the best route my friend.  But I am a little curious.  Curious to know in what ways do you feel yourself hurting others?  And along similar lines, in what way were you damaged?  Only trying to get to know your situation a little bit better :)"
SuicideWatch,fk7qpug,t3_fgqqdy,1583941808.0,"Listen my friend, you fucked up.  There's no denying that.  Like you said, you had no excuse for your behavior towards your younger brother all those years.  But you know what else there's no denying?  That right now, you are truly sorry.  Truly remorseful.  Truly apologetic.  How do I know?  Because you feel as if a simple apology won't cut it.  The only way - in your mind - the only way to truly show your brother that you are sorry is by killing yourself - as then he will be able to comprehend just how bad you felt for all those years.

And you know what?  I don't blame you for wanting to die.  I don't blame you for thinking the best option would be to kill yourself.  At all.  But I want to talk with you for a little while.  No judgment whatsoever :)  I gather that you are secretly hoping that other people will tell you to kill yourself?"
SuicideWatch,fk2hvm5,t3_fg4umr,1583801414.0,"I don’t blame you for missing that feeling.  Let me explain.  When you are in combat, it is your life - or theirs.  And in that moment, when you kill the enemy, you know that you are going to survive for another moment, at the very least.  And then another.  And another.  And another.  And not only that, you proved yourself to be dominant over the enemy.  You killed someone who was trying - with all their might that they could muster - to kill you.  You won.  And anybody would get a rush of euphoria after living through the jaws of death.  Anyone.

But I’m sure you’re afraid that if you tell anyone, they’ll paint you as a monster.  As someone who enjoys killing in cold blood.  As someone evil.  But they can’t understand.  They can’t understand just what it’s like to be inches from death...only then to become death itself.  Only those who have been in combat could ever possibly hope to know what that’s like...

So thank you so much for reaching out today my friend.  It must have taken a lot of guts to share this part of yourself, not knowing the kind of reaction you would receive here.  Just know that I think that your feelings here are totally warranted and valid, and hope that this brings you a little bit of ease :)"
SuicideWatch,fjhk1nq,t3_fdcb4b,1583349632.0,"I bet hearing that broke you into pieces.  A thousand little pieces.  You pictured your dad at work, listening in as his coworkers compliment each other about their kids.  And you pictured your dad there, just watching, with that grim face, unable to participate in the discussion...  Feeling like you had let down your parents - this much - would make anyone question if they even belong in this world.  And if one had been depressed for years, already feeling like a burden, such as yourself, I can absolutely see why you were pushed to the edge.  I can absolutely see why you want your last day to be tomorrow.  And I don't blame you.  At all.

But I'd love to talk for a while my friend.  To walk back the path with you, as we, together, retrace your steps, figuring out just what it is, and why, that you hate so much about yourself.  It pains me to know that you are suffering this much, and have been, for so long.  So let's talk for a little while :)  

Why do you hate yourself more than anyone?"
SuicideWatch,fjgjgxa,t3_fda598,1583328363.0,"I'm sorry to hear about his passing - and your current struggles, too, my friend.  I know at first glance it may seem like he was incredibly strong for having the courage to successfully kill himself.  But the reality is, he was neither stronger - nor weaker - than all those who have attempted unsuccessfully - and those who never attempted at all.  Some will say he was incredibly strong for overcoming the survival instinct to kill himself, while others will say that he was too weak to open up.

Me?  I won't say either of those things.  The only common denominator I see here is the fact that he was suffering - just like yourself.  He was in tremendous pain - and you are as well my friend.  So talk to me for a little while.  When you say you have failed at everything, can you give me some examples of what ""everything"" means? :)"
SuicideWatch,fjduwpl,t1_fjdodmb,1583259732.0,"And I'm sure that it feels like a relief, in some sort of weird way.  Where you do not have to worry about your sarcasm and cynicism, trying to resist it, trying to control it, the whole nine yards.  Let me ask you this...how's that going for you?  Not having to think about how you talk to people or the way the message carries over?"
SuicideWatch,fjdezgz,t1_fjckvvn,1583251861.0,"And that's the funny thing.  Because we can even identify that it would be helpful to open up, yet we still resist it even though we know it will be to our benefit?  Why?  Well, there's so, so many reasons.  And I would never fault you for having that hesitancy - I know I certainly maintained it for many years myself.  

I'd imagine that it must feel like it's chipping away at you however?  Always feeling compelled to deploy your sarcasm and cynicism so as to avoid opening up.  I'm sure one part of your body is screaming ""let me be free"" while the other one always wins out in the end.  Let me ask you this...what would the good and bad be of opening up?  As in, can you list of a few examples for each?"
SuicideWatch,fjbh1mk,t1_fjbgez0,1583193103.0,"And you know what?  I don't blame you.  I don't blame you for not wanting to bring a child into the world.  I don't blame you for thinking you may not live long enough to care for said child.  And I certainly don't blame you for wanting to end your life?  From what it sounds like to me, you've been through such a roller-coaster ride of life that only people in their 60s and above have experienced.  And you're in your 20s.  Goddamn.  

So you know what?  Talk to me.  Tell me first about your teenage depression.  I promise not to dismiss it :)  

Why did you originally try to kill yourself all those years ago?"
SuicideWatch,fjbgld5,t1_fjbclts,1583192816.0,"You know, in my mind, I just picture a soda bottle being shaken over...and over...and over...   And then when it's finally been shaken enough over the years, you toss a few mentos in....  I think you get the idea...

You've held out for so long, and been so incredibly strong powering through the first few years, but now the mentos have been added, and you're ready to burst.  So let's see if we can stabilize this hand that's doing the shaking, shall we?  :)

When you say there are things that you can't deal with in your usual way...what are those things?"
SuicideWatch,fjb9y2b,t1_fjb9ct6,1583189334.0,"Of course you feel that way.  You wouldn't want to leave any loose ends here, after all.  You're a trooper for even being this dedicated and showing up to your restaurant on a day like today, after all.  Truly, I must give you credit.  

In your original posting my friend, you said that you couldn't do ""it"" anymore.  If you don't mind me asking, what exactly did you mean by ""it""?"
SuicideWatch,fjb8wfo,t1_fjb7ald,1583188836.0,"Nah haha you're good.  And I'm sure that the fact of you being not able to break out of it probably also reaffirms the fact that people don't change - thereby making you even more depressed.  However, when you say you not really open up...you did in this post.  I just want to point that out for a second...to show you that you are capable of doing so.  

And let's focus on this topic a little bit, ""opening up as a weakness to be avoided.""  Let's take your words here as they are, and say that if one opens up, then they are weak.  Let me ask you this?  What would be wrong with being weak - in this context?  (I know it may seem like a dumb question, but give yourself a second or two to think)"
SuicideWatch,fjb3uwe,t1_fjaatyo,1583185952.0,"Okay!  That I can absolutely understand and relate to..  So if we go with the first case scenario, my next question would accordingly be what are you protecting yourself from?  In other words, why deploy the sarcasm and cynicism so as not to open up?

And if we go with the second case scenario, do you mean to say that because you open up too much, that's why you are so sarcastic and everything?  Sorry, I'm just trying to make sure I've got things straight here :)"
SuicideWatch,fjb0trs,t3_fcj72o,1583184287.0,"I don't know how you work...what....12 hours?  16?  20?  That double shift, with this weight on your mind.  Or perhaps, perhaps there is no longer any weight at all.  Just a calm, easy peacefulness in the pit of your stomach.  After all, the prospect of not having to cry yourself to sleep tonight might feel absolutely wonderful, I'd imagine.  I know you're busy, so if you can't find time to respond - that's fine.  But I am curious to hear your story and learn why you cry yourself to sleep every night in the first place :)"
