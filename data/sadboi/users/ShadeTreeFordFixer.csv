SuicideWatch,et9sjs5,t3_calbtd,1562604435.0,"Sometimes it takes being closer to death than you’ve ever been to understand how badly you want to live. In 2014 I attempted suicide (via ingestion of pills, like you) and by chance, lived - barely. It’s been five years, and I now have a decently paying job, I am married, own two vehicles, have a son and my own little hole in the wall to call Home. Truly, life gets better. The thing they don’t tell you, though, is that you have to get up, get out, and fight for it. Glad you lived OP"

mentalhealth,es3qbsg,t3_c5pphf,1561568344.0,"I know it’s been said 800,000 times, but with time, it gets better. Every house needs a rock-bottom foundation; When you’re as low as you can get, literally the only way you can go is up. 
In 2014, I hit rock bottom. Lost my job, couldn’t pay bills, girlfriend left, Dad was dead, and I had nothing. After being affronted by depression for years and years, I finally let it win. I took a lethal concoction of every pill and tablet I had in the house, which totaled over 70. I sent my estranged Mother a message for the first time in two or so years, and from that she gathered something was wrong, and sent police and ambulances to my residence. I spent the next month on the third floor (psychiatric unit) of the local hospital, staying to myself in my room, pretending like I was getting better. I only wanted to die, and I was going to try until it worked. After being released, I took more pills, went into a stupor for a couple days, vomited it all out, and continued living. I don’t remember why, but I decided to try to give this living thing another shot, despite life throwing every unsavory thing at me, like homelessness, unemployability, and friendlessness. Skip to today, June 26, 5 years later: I have a good full-time job, a WIFE of a year, a beautiful Son, my own apartment, two vehicles that I own outright, and yes, debilitating depression and sucidality. The ugly truth is that you will never be cured of it; you can only learn to live with it, and even let it motivate you. If I’m not working hard, or chasing my kid, or wrenching on my truck, I can feel it slipping in. You just have to use it to your advantage."
