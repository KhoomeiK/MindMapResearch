When in all reality it’s probably both of our faults. It usually starts with either my feelings get hurt, or I’m mad."

Like I am not going to be able to perform or well orgasm, and it takes so long I feel like it makes it a hassle for him. Not that he’s really said anything."
sex,foqi1t2,t1_foqg14s,1587994042.0,I thought about that but I’ve tried with my eyes closed as well
sex,foqf7x2,t1_foqemxg,1587992132.0,I do enjoy it even if I don’t orgasm. I have told him. The only thing I haven’t said is that I noticed that he doesn’t seem to try as often.

Personally it also makes me feel unattractive at times because he doesn’t initiate often. I also feel like maybe he doesn’t care about me as much as I do him because of it."

TwoXSex,fnhbrsv,t3_g0qnd3,1586959335.0,"I have had several threesomes. Three with a couple, I was the third. And one with a guy I was dating and one of his female friends. My current boyfriend has expressed interest in one. But I have insecurities about doing it because I love him, and it’s new love. I didn’t love the other guy I dated so it wasn’t an issue. I’m not really afraid he will leave me, but I’m afraid that I will get jealous during it, or he will want to do it all the time. Or maybe I am just not enough for him. His sex drive is lower than mine so the fact he wants this makes me feel like maybe he is not that happy having sex with me. Or I’m not that attractive to him. So in my experience yes there’s probably gonna be some insecurities. Especially if you care or love the person. I think you definitely need to feel secure in your relationship before you do it though."

dating,fcjhanc,t3_ehh4gy,1577687568.0,"Can you be around your ex without having to deal with unresolved or ongoing feelings? Could you potentially be hurt again? Could this delay yourself from moving forward? I can’t tell you what you should do. But I would ask myself these questions before making a decision. She’s probably having mixed feelings, that’s why she’s sending mixed signals. Isn’t usually a good sign in my experience."
mentalhealth,fcjgimc,t3_ehgt0w,1577686756.0,"Been through similar. My advice is to be really easy on yourself, and get some therapy from a qualified therapist. As hard as it is to go through, it’s worth the healing you can achieve. I wish I had dealt with my trauma a lot sooner in life. I’m 45, and this happened as a teen. I didn’t truly deal with all (or most) of it til probably my thirties. I’m not a Dr but sounds like you maybe suffering from some PTSD from this trauma as well. Things do get better, you can heal. Your a strong person and you can survive this. My PM’s are always open."
datingoverthirty,fcjfnsm,t3_ehg0w5,1577685873.0,"I’m also older, 45. Out of a 13 year relationship just over a year. Personally I would just go with it and enjoy whatever it may bring,if it makes you happy, life’s short, find happiness where you can get it, as it’s often fleeting. I have felt like you do, I had to change my mindset to dating, because I was setting myself up to get hurt, by expectations if nothing else. It’s made things easier and I’m happier. I understand not wanting to get hurt, but nothing is ever really guaranteed. Our long term relationships surely weren’t. They say life is a journey not a destination. Can’t this relationship just be a journey without a set destination? You know what is best for you.
