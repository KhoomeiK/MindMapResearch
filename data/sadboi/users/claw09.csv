The mask ends up giving a false sense of security against transmission so people don't take the more important precautions of staying away form other people and proper hygiene.

Medical professionals don't have this issue because they know how to properly use a mask.

KatarinaMains,fpvuzgp,t3_gfktb4,1588952317.0,"I highly disagree with your math here. Katarina's damage is something that compounds onto itself. Her whole kit is built around damage. I know it looks like it's just a 44 damage nerf, but it's not. It's 44 damage off of an AOE dagger that she will land on several people sometimes. A well placed Q-E-W combo is 2 daggers hopefully onto 3 people. That 44x6=264. Throughout a short team fight, you might hit 3 or 4 daggers (no resets included) . Let's be pessimistic and round up to only 400 damage. Since her kit is a reset based kit, not getting a kill with that 400 damage means not getting the rest of your kills.

Another issue with Katarina's compounding interest-style kit is her healing. Since she enjoys being in the middle of a fight, we've gravitated to items that let us heal from the damage we deal. Auto-attacking champions supplement this with lifesteal. We use gunblade, Deaths Dance, and conquerer. Not much to choose from, but it works well enough. If you went the Gunblade, DD, Conq build, you were healing ALOT. But most of that healing was from 2 sources of damage, your daggers and your ult. So nerfing Katrina's damage, also nerfs her healing, which nerfs her ability to stay alive long enough to get a reset, which in turn also nerfs her damage.

It's a compounding problem. This is the reason I think RIOT has been so slow to put out a nerf for Kat. They know that this style of nerf is a huge problem, but if they nerf her E CD, then you have a quality of life problem on a mechanics-based champion, which might be just as bad.

Idk how they are going to fine-tune this nerf, but I just wanted to say that it's extremely deceptive to assume that this is just a 44 damage nerf.

While I'm here, can anyone explain to me why people actually build DD instead of a tanky AP item? If you have Gunblade, the AP will from the AP item will supplement your healing from gunblade and also provide residences."

AskReddit,fjhwlav,t3_fdbdik,1583356397.0,"My brother, dad, and I were at our old house (still owned) doing some renovation. My dad asked my brother and I to start cleaning the pool. When we went to the pool, the gate was locked. Now, we could've gone uphill, went inside, back downstairs, back outside to open the gate from the other side like a normal person, but my genius brain, in the interest of saving us the trip, decided to ask my brother to just climb over the fence. I asked him because I'm overweight and he has better control over his lower bodyweight. That was such a dumb decision.
We knew the layout and it didn't seem like a risky idea. On the other side of the fence was a platform only 3 feet up from the top of the fence. I thought he would just hop over and then hop down. Obviously, I was stupidly wrong. I thought that because of his lighter weight, he'd be fine and that the fence would hold him. But as he was at the highest point of the fence, the wood cracked and gave way.
He fell down in the wrong direction and instead of falling 3 feet onto dirt, he fell a good 5 feet onto concrete pavement. Luckily he landed in a way such that his hands absorbed most of the force and a random piece of gravel took out a small chunk of his upper lip. We ran him to hospital, he got stitched up, and was fine in a day and was cosmetically back to normal in only 2 months. I felt so guilty for a while since I told him to climb the fence when I could've just walked around. 
The scary part, and what might have killed him was what separated the dirt platform and the concrete pavement he landed on. I now I'm not describing the layout well, but basically, there were cinderblocks making up the wall of the dirt platform, and he missed by only an inch or 2. Just knowing that he was an inch away from having either his head split and face scraped like that made me sick."

Science has been honest for a while. As long as you know how to source information, it's not hard to find credible studies.

Go to long-established scientific journals, read up on what a good scientific process is, and how to interpret the results of a study within the scope of a study.

Morally, you aren't just forcing people to pay your bills, you're sharing the cost of unforseen risk to your society with your society. That's a long-running part of society.

1) Weight matters. It's the reason the stereotypical bouncer is 7 feet tall and 300lbs. Not only can presence stop most fights from happening, but F=ma. And the easiest way to double F is by doubling m. Also, never underestimate a low center-of-mass. A short and fat, even if weak, person can still flip you just because that's how physics works.

2) drunk people can't fight. They are off-balance, can't think quickly, and can't react quickly. They can't punch fast, which going back to F=ma is the a part, and they can't dodge. A person in a drunken rage might be scary, but it is still a *drunken* rage."

MurderedByWords,fg04f1i,t1_fg03oep,1580399973.0,"That's fine if you want to fight poverty, but your argument still does not follow from your premises. It's absolutely true that lower rates of poverty are connected to lower rates of violence. People aren't disagreeing with you because they think poverty is bad; they are disagreeing because your argument conclusion does not follow from the points you make. Gun regulation is a much more accurate predictor of how many gun-related homicides, suicides, and mass killings occur, not poverty. Even in areas with high rates of poverty, crime will go up, but if there is proper gun regulation, than gun-related violence won't go up."

MurderedByWords,ffzn0ng,t1_ffze4s8,1580386539.0,"That's not the point at all. Without including all of the regulations surrounding guns, you could easily walk away with the conclusion that more guns = less problems. Which isn't true at all. The correlation isn't causation and that needs to be emphasized to have an educated discussion on gun control."
ARG,ffyvh0h,t3_evwwt6,1580356159.0,"This is what I messaged the account:

Seems like the American National Emblem. The original Latin Phrase was E Pluribus Unum, but this has been swapped for Nullus Evadit. Nullus Evadit translates to ""No one Escapes."" Also, the American Emblem had 13 stars in the top circle, representing the 13 original colonies. This one only contains one star. This American Emblem also only has one read, but this one seems to combined with the duel-headed bird Emblem of Russia.

Are you showing us the national Emblem for Warstead? Is this a future (or past) were Russia and America are one nation?

I'll edit when I get a response.

Also, when you download the image, the reddit username is not tagged with it."

MurderedByWords,ffyth2r,t1_ffyomh1,1580354724.0,"If you're going to reference gun ownership in European countries, then it's important to cite HOW they own guns too. Gun advocates love to cite Sweden's 50% gun ownership rate, but conveniently forget to mention that firearms are illegal to carry unless for a specific, legal purpose, such as hunting. If the gun is not in use, it must be kept unloaded in a secure and supervised location. This is much more restrictive than the the US where, in Georgia, you can conceal a fully loaded weapon into any place public area and any location that hasn't specified that guns aren't allowed.
In France, you can't carry a weapon in public, unless you've applied for a 1-year license, which is rarely given out.
In Germany, firearm permits are usually only given out to security professionals. They have a small firearm's license that is easily accessible, but only allows non-lethal gas guns and glare guns.

You can't bring up high ownership of guns in Europe without mentioning the high amount of regulations associated with them."

Cooking,ffqoz5k,t3_eucjra,1580140251.0,"Depending on the restaurant you wait at, ask a line cook or chef if they can spare a moment to teach you timing. Home cooking usually assumes time as a luxury you can afford. Restaurant cooks do not have that luxury, so they've learned to cook without it.

Timing is what can make a simple 2 eggs, bacon, and pancake breakfast from taking 30 minutes to make down to 10."
