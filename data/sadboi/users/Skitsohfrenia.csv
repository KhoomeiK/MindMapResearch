schizophrenia,finjacs,t3_f8p86h,1582564364.0,"In my opinion it's because schizophrenia is associated with an inability to function (same with autism.) You can't offer anything substantial to society because you're schizophrenic, so you must have SOMETHING you're good at, right? Maybe it's art because that's considered the easiest and lowest form of contribution, maybe it's art because no one can understand your illness and therefore it's abstract and creative. It's definitely a stereotype for a reason."
schizophrenia,fg4b7ab,t3_ewj8jr,1580500044.0,"I am having a good day. I hope you're also having a good day/night.

I'm no professional but I think what you're describing is depersonalization. I'm like this nearly constantly, myself. I have a little list tucked away that reminds me who I am and what I'm like to other people. I also ask others about myself a lot. It helps me with remembering myself sometimes but doesn't help with the odd disconnection feeling I have. 

I also always feel like I'm narcissistic when I'm asking others about myself, but it's just that I feel like I have no self identity and need to be reminded what I'm like, lol..."
schizophrenia,fe1cjko,t3_eni43x,1578825050.0,"Hey, it's okay. You can be upset about this. Hell, you have a right to be upset. Don't beat yourself up over being angry at something that has taken the lives of so many. Certainly don't give up. There's always a good life out there for you, even if it's not what you thought at first. I read countless success stories from everyone on this subreddit. I'm nearly middle aged and just learning to drive because this shit struck me in highschool. Lol. 

The definition of ambition is to keep striving for better, even when you're struck down. You can do it and I love you. This goes for anyone reading this too. Take it easy."
schizophrenia,fdeb67u,t3_ekw2y5,1578335191.0,"OCD has a terrible streak of getting misdiagnosed as schizophrenia! It's because the intense anxiety and fear caused by the disorder is often irrational or unfounded, which mimicks delusional behavior. I'm really glad you were able to figure that out about yourself, it's a difficult journey you're on! Best wishes!"
schizophrenia,fd7curz,t1_fd74hsd,1578202500.0,"The 54321 method goes like this. You need to find:

5 things you can see  
4 things you can feel  
3 things you can hear  
2 things you can smell  
1 thing you can taste

It's not important to get everything, for example, if you can't find 3 things to hear. What's important is that you focus on what you find. It can help you find your way back to everything and might help your depersonalization."
schizophrenia,fd73jcq,t3_ek7kur,1578198981.0,"Yeah, me too. It's pretty common with psychotic and dissociative disorders. It's called depersonalization, iirc.

Grounding yourself using the 54321 technique might help, if you ever feel the need."
schizophrenia,fd72cik,t3_ek75bt,1578198568.0,"Anti-psychotics, as the name implies, are supposed to combat psychosis (hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thought & speech.) When you take an antipsychotic, it regulates the amount of dopamine in your brain, which is thought to be responsible for psychosis when there's too much. If it's been 2 months, and you don't experience any changes, I'd talk to a professional about trying a different medicine. Best of luck!"
schizophrenia,fczxz1l,t3_ejn9ob,1578110554.0,"As my flair on here suggests, I have quite a few diagnoses myself. I'm not comfortable sharing them all at once, but what matters here is that I have a developmental disorder, schizophrenia, and a dissociative disorder. I also have a few physical disabilities, although they aren't as debilitating. So I'm pretty awful at taking care of myself, remembering people who are important to me and other important things, I'm a little bit on the slow side, and I often have a disconnect with reality and myself. 

My support system is my boyfriend and his family. His family, although they help me through the worst of it, they tend to make me feel as though I'm a freeloader, I take advantage of everyone, I'm lazy and unmotivated (lol), I'm unable to do things for myself, etc. My boyfriend doesn't make me feel this way, but whenever I do something silly, whether it's because of the developmental disorder or because of the schizophrenia, he kind of treats me like a child, or a pet. I still don't fully know how to prevent this from happening altogether, I feel like it's sadly one of the outcomes of being mentally/physically disabled, and it is very frustrating. 

The best advice I can give you is to advocate for yourself. Even if it makes others upset, be vocal that you can make your own decisions, and if you don't ask for help outright, or look like you're dying, then you don't need help. I hope things get better for you!"

If you have any concerns about your disorder, or if you notice new symptoms or changes, you should speak to a professional as soon as you can. Best wishes."
schizophrenia,fcp6aeg,t3_eicitv,1577851871.0,"Yeah, I get the same thing. You can try the counting method, where you count to x, and then get up and do what you need to do. I usually count to 20, and then I get up and do things. Idk why this helps."
schizophrenia,fcp4oeq,t3_ei949z,1577850362.0,"Hi, I have had STPD and now schizophrenia. Most cases of STPD don't turn into schizophrenia. In my opinion I still have STPD, I just also have schizophrenia now, which overshadows and overlaps the other. With STPD, I didn't really have hallucinations, anything I did have was very minor. What was mostly wrong was that I talked strange around other people, I had unconventional beliefs and I was delusional. I felt extremely disconnected from others, which led to secondary depression.

The process of schizophrenia was very different to me. Whereas you may be schizotypal for many years without change, and it mostly affects your thought process and ego, schizophrenia develops suddenly or over time, and it affects your perception of the world and reality. Over time I no longer would care for my hygiene, I would become extremely disorganized, odd things that I would say to others now turned into odd behaviors, accusations, etc. My hallucinations and delusions ramped up, making them increasingly difficult to cope with, and more visible to my friends and family. It's a lot more intense and thorough than STPD is, and the process for me was slow and hard, and very inconsistent. I had very easy days and very hard days.

When I later relayed this to my psychiatrist (who wasn't the same person who diagnosed me with STPD, but I still trusted them,) they were concerned that I had developed schizophrenia. This would be the person who would later diagnose me.

If you're ever concerned about your disorder, or you notice changes or new symptoms, bring this up with a professional as soon as you can. I hope this helped you. Best wishes."
schizophrenia,fcp2236,t1_fcoie3j,1577848079.0,"Don't quote me on this, but I think it's reflective of how the person sees themselves, consciously or subconsciously. If you think more negatively of yourself, your environment, others around you, you're more likely to have hateful voices. If you think more positively, well, they're more friendly. It's all about your perception."
straightedge,fcp1abr,t3_ee9qhh,1577847409.0,"I'm really not someone who limits who I chill with. My fiance smokes weed and drinks occasionally, so do my friends, and so have my exs. I see being SxE as my personal choice, and their personal choice is to be intoxicated, to be blunt. I don't got a problem with that. I have even cooked meals for them after they come in my house w/ the munchies, lol. I guess it's really about what you're comfortable with and who you're comfortable with. I can see it being very tiring and worrisome dating someone who is extremely irresponsible with their drug & alcohol use, though. Best of luck to those of you finding love out there."
