AskWomenOver30,fqya7gk,t3_glad0a,1589745290.0,"NTA. Seriously, you are a saint for what you put up with here. I got stressed out just reading about your experience with this person. It’s pretty disturbing, but there are people who do things like this. Sometimes the person was never sick, or they were sick but it wasn’t serious or life-threatening and they exaggerated their symptoms for an extended period of time. It gets messy when they seek out or attract people with co-dependency issues (not saying this is you at all, just a general note) because those people want to help and find so much value in helping. In your case it seems like he may have sought you out because you grew up together. Your support might have given him credibility in the eyes of others, if that makes sense. Regardless, I am so sorry you had to go through that. As someone who has multiple chronic illnesses, it drives me nuts to read about stories like this. These people make it so much harder for people who are actually sick to be taken seriously and listened to, especially if they struggle with invisible illnesses."

AskWomenOver30,fqv5xu6,t3_gkwlaq,1589670524.0,"The week of my 28th birthday I was in and out of the hospital with (yet another) fever and chest infection. I broke up with my boyfriend after he was verbally abusive. I had to move on a whim because my neighbors were being investigated for multiple drug charges (and other much more serious things, I suspect). And to top it all off- my best friend lost her job and spontaneously decided to move across the country. It was awful. Then, 28 proceeded to *suck.* I had worsening respiratory/autoimmune health issues that forced me to leave the career I’d spent my entire life working towards. My body fought hard to function at the most basic level while my friends got married, bought houses, got promoted, and had kids. They were never sympathetic or empathetic about my situation; it was just as if I had died. Since I couldn’t go out and party or share in the same milestones, I didn’t exist anymore. I was made to feel guilty for seeking the smallest bit of emotional support even though I’d always been there for them. When they disappeared, I learned to truly rely on myself and focus on that relationship. I did a ton of research on the types of jobs that would be manageable with my health issues and then I submitted applications. Nothing. I did more research, prayed on it, and decided to go back to school to change my career entirely. 

I’m turning 30 in exactly 3 months and life is so much better now. My health is the best it has been in years since I’ve been able to rest and limit exposures. I got into the #1 program in the country for my new career field and will start in August. I am in consideration for a scholarship that would make it free. The program is online so my weak lungs and immune system will not be at risk as a vaccine is developed for COVID-19. I was able to purchase a condo along with a family member because it was exponentially cheaper than renting in my new area where all of my doctors are, and we agreed to put it in their name in case I have another major medical emergency and can’t afford to make payments. It’s nothing fancy but it’s in a safe and beautiful area. I lost the bad friends and focused on my family which is small but mighty. I’ve taken a break from dating and I’ve accepted that I may never be able to have the relationship/marriage/family I wanted because of my health issues - and I am okay with that. I am at peace. 

There will be plenty of people lining up to tell you that you *should* have X, Y, and Z by 30. I am here to tell you that you are still so, so young and life is just beginning. I honestly feel that way about life in general. Any age is young and full of potential with the right attitude and mindset. When I lost everything at 28, I stopped listening to the people who needed to force everything into a perfect little timeline because life doesn’t work like that. Even the people who *seem* to have it are dealing with their own issues behind closed doors. 

You will find your way. You will recover. The worst days will teach you what you are capable of, even when you’d rather be without that lesson. Focus on you and what makes you happy, including (and especially) the small stuff. Cultivating gratitude during the lowest point of my life made everything seem like a blessing and a gift. My dog’s smile, a sunny day, a sweet gesture from a stranger. You deserve to feel everything you are feeling- good, bad and ugly. But remember to hold on to the stuff that makes you believe in the magical potential of what can be. Hold on to the good with everything you have, and know that you are never alone. ♥️"

MarriedAtFirstSight,fqfj7j7,t3_gi8uji,1589325865.0,"Please forgive my short novel haha but I was just thinking about this the other day! I came to the same number and I couldn’t believe it...I did the math a few times because I really thought that number was higher. If I had to guess, I think that one of the major problems is that they’re working with self-report data. Every item and unit of analysis, no matter how detailed and seemingly sophisticated, relies on each participant’s subjective evaluation of themselves and others. The main example that comes to mind is that some people applying for the show might *think* they’re ready for marriage, but they’re really just sick of dating. These two things are not the same! So some contestants (like Mindy) come on to fully invest because they’re ready for that level of commitment, no matter the obstacles involved along the way. Then there’s someone like Zach, who clearly (IMHO) saw this as dating with a few legal strings attached. He wasn’t going to move in, he wasn’t going to be vulnerable, and he wasn’t even going to be exclusive! There are lots of factors that influence the likelihood of the couple staying together (in past seasons I think of compatibility with career goals/finances, beliefs about gender roles, communication styles, etc.) but I think it starts with each person’s emotional maturity and level of seriousness about the commitment they’ve signed up for. I know that I do not envy the experts — there seems to be a lot of people who say what sounds nice instead of just saying the truth. With that kind of deception (intentional or not), some couples end up doomed from the start."

With a pit in my stomach, I immediately tried to justify my previous partners: “Oh, well, one was a serious boyfriend of four years. The other was my first relationship after I graduated from college...and we only slept together like two times.” Once again, utterly ridiculous and unnecessary mental gymnastics for something a man would never be expected to explain. He treated me like I was less worthy — *less of a human being* — because I had been with TWO partners in my life! And you know what happened next? When I asked him how many partners he had been with, assuming he would say 0, he said 11! Apparently he was a virgin until 24 and in ONE year (the year before we met) he slept with 11 women. Women he barely knew. One night stands. All. Casual. Sex. Of course there is nothing wrong with that, but do you think he felt any shame at all upon telling me that? NOPE. But yes, men of the world, please tell me once more how everything applies to everyone in the same way and double standards are a myth. 😒"

This will help your therapist assess if they are the best fit for you in reaching those goals - and therapist fit makes all the difference!

AskWomenOver30,fljuofr,t1_fljcw0t,1585227050.0,"This. Getting married in your twenties is so often romanticized when in reality it’s a hot mess.

I’m about to turn 30 and I am so excited to date after taking a little break these past few years to focus on myself and my career.

thebachelor,flh7m1g,t3_fos90j,1585157564.0,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Not just for your selfless and heroic work as a nurse, but for speaking up here. I’m from the DC metro area but my mom recently moved down to Florida after retiring. We got into the biggest fight of our lives when she refused to stay home because “no one else was” and “it wasn’t a problem in Florida yet.” I have an MPH and have worked with EIS officers in my career. Not to get too political, but the accuracy and legitimacy of surveillance data is directly tied to government support (or, as we’re seeing in this administration, interference). The surveillance data and general responses to this pandemic will be noted in history for how they directly contributed to its spread. None of it is accurate because we have lost our public health infrastructure to respond to this exact kind of crisis. Entire committees that would have prepared us for this pandemic have been removed. States and LHDs (once again, my apologies for getting political - but *especially* those who currently have Republican leadership under this administration, like Florida) are actively misleading their constituents. It’s not a conspiracy, it’s simple psychology. Our current POTUS wants business to resume as usual, but as we are right now that would lead to the preventable deaths of millions of people. If he can label people hysterics who simply want to point out the science, he thinks things will magically go back to how they were. They will not, I assure you, and his words will infect communities right before the virus does. He does not understand infectious disease epidemiology and he has largely systematically silenced those who do. I’m sorry to get so political, but I cannot be silent anymore. Florida’s response to this has been devastating, and their communities are the most vulnerable (the sheer number of travelers passing through, older adult population, etc.). We. Have. To. Stay. Home. It is not up for debate. 

My mom is only listening to me now because after attending a bunch of events in her community, guess what? She developed symptoms of COVID-19. My mom is nearly 70 years old. She went to the doctor on her third day of symptoms after I flipped out at her (she initially refused, citing the “hysteria” rhetoric) but surprise, surprise they had no tests. She’s still adjusting to Florida so she doesn’t have an established PCP. The rando doctor she went to told her it was nothing serious (?????) even though he couldn’t tell her if she was positive. Even when she was having trouble breathing, and could have been given a breathing treatment, he did nothing. I told her to do some research since she has nothing else to do and find a legitimate PCP since that guy was a quack. Thankfully, she did, and in another piece of good news: her community is now part of a massive testing rollout (that came with a huge press briefing and the attendance of the governor....interesting flex there). She was tested yesterday and will get her results back by Friday (though that sounds a little fast to me). She is on her 13th day of quarantining in total. Even though I would love to see her, I’ve been advising her from here because I have asthma, a history of bronchitis, and I’m immune compromised. I know that I would not survive this if I got it, but I would do anything to help and protect my mom and her community (mostly 65+), even if it meant driving down to block her from leaving her house and risking my life in the process. Please, please WAKE UP and think before you speak if you want to defend anyone who diminishes the seriousness of this while health professionals are advising otherwise and people are losing their lives in really horrific ways. 

I care about every single person here and I would be devastated if something happened to you, your loved ones, or a single soul in your community because one of these BN people thought their platform on Instagram was more important than the pleas of health professionals who are risking their lives to keep us alive. They are not an authority on this subject. They have no place making claims about it. Please listen to those who are and encourage others to do the same. Stay safe everyone. 

OP, God bless you and your husband. Thinking of you both and sending so much love your way."

birthcontrol,fkuoqh1,t3_fk5l6f,1584553336.0,"I had a similar experience about 2 years ago when I tried to get the copper IUD. I have health issues that make nearly every other form of birth control impossible to use without serious complications, and the doctor flat out refused to do the procedure. She said she doesn't give them to patients who haven't finished having kids (??). Since I hadn't, in her words, ""even had my first,"" she said it would be irresponsible to pursue it. I remember feeling so dumbfounded that I didn't even know what to say."

I have an old Minolta that I used back in high school 10 years ago, but I’ve recently been eyeing a Canon EOS M50 after receiving recommendations from a few friends. I’d love any feedback or thoughts on this model or those comparable to it. Thank you!"
