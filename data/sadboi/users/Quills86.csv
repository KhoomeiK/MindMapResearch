Wollte dir nur nen Rat geben, weil ich selbst auch dazu tendiere, mich manchmal selbst zu belügen, wenn ich mich einer unangenehmen Situation stellen muss. Und ich kann auch ein bisschen nachvollziehen, weshalb dich die Droge damals gefunden hat, da ich selber eine starke Depression hab und zusätzlich noch Ads. Gewisse Drogen fühlen sich da extrem gut an (Keta vor allem) weshalb ich vor ein paar Jahren ganz bewusst entschieden hab, nur zu besonderen Anlässen zu konsumieren, bzw an zwei Tagen im Jahr.

Ich schreib dir jetzt nicht ""mach nen Entzug"", denn es ist dein Leid und dein Leben. Ich kenn deine Gründe nicht wirklich, weshalb du irgendwann mal die Entscheidung getroffen hast ""das ist jetzt die Droge, die mich für eine lange Zeit begleiten wird.""

I'm still thankful for that tbh, because now I don't care much, if I'm reaching legend again. Games from Rank 5 to legend became much less stressful now."
depression,ez62ci5,t1_ez5y16k,1567708345.0,"I know exactly what you mean. It's like someone takes control over you and your life. It helps though to do simple things again and I'm not so scared anymore. I had panic attacks and couldn't go outside, that stopped luckily. But I don't want to take them my whole life. That's what scares me the most. That I can't function without them.

Thanks for reading my comment. It's maybe weird to say, but your story and your answer made me happy today. Didn't feel alone :)"
hearthstone,ez5xhpy,t1_ez5w7py,1567706476.0,"I just tried it out. Had so much fun and the list felt very consistent. But I will for sure read your guide. Even though, I played tons of Rogue in the past and have around 700 wins with the class, I'm not so familiar with Tempo Rogue. Mostly played prenerf Kingsbane in wild, Tess and Mill Rogue.
Your guide will help for sure :) thanks for it and for this cool list."
depression,ez5vfoj,t3_czzcgj,1567705723.0,"Hey, I'm suffering from ptsd as well. I really appreciate it, that you told us a bit from your past, it helped me to read that, because I can relate to it.
My mum was never really stable in her emotions, she couldn't show love and my dad left the country and returned to his homeland, when I was a kid. My stepfather was simply terrible, when I was a teen. Very strict and sometimes abusive. A lot more stuff happened, when I was a child and a teen, which really made me sick over the years.

I never had much contact to my real father because of my mum. I didn't want to upset her. Recently I got the news that he died four years ago and that really hit me hard. Last resort for me were antidepressants, I was too deep in my depression and it became more than serious.

They kind of help me, I can finally eat and sleep again, but I never was a real fan of this kind of solution.

Don't know, why I wrote all this, your text really opened something. I hope that you will feel happy one day, don't forget that there are people who feel similar. Don't believe that you are alone. I could feel your pain.
English isn't my first language, sorry for some misunderstanding maybe.
I wish you the best!"
hearthstone,ez5roct,t1_ez5j8ci,1567703814.0,Wow! That's great! Especially because you did it as an underdog. Rogue seems to be very underrepresented atm. Gz
hearthstone,ez5rkkt,t1_ez4rycg,1567703745.0,Thank you!
hearthstone,ez4qzaf,t1_ez4p8pq,1567690877.0,Mind sharing your list as well?
hearthstone,ez4qat4,t1_ez46ttt,1567690603.0,"I agree. I still play Control Warrior from time to time, if I want to play a deck, which doesn't rely on randomly generated cards to win the game. Control Warrior is a fair deck imo, which doesn't need to highroll to win. Yes, Booms Hero Power and the Assembly can be random too, but it's still not the same like in Mage or Shaman for example. That ""created by"" Bloodlust or the random Mind Control from a Puzzlebox are often the reason, why Mage or Shaman win in the end. Control Warrior doesn't need that, it's just a strong deck overall.

But the nerf still hurts. It's kinda huge, that you can't use the hero power in the same turn. People who are still complaining, that the nerf wasn't a real nerf, never ever played Control Warrior themselves. I'm tired of all the salty tears."
CompetitiveHS,eyywzf1,t1_eyywcnk,1567604107.0,"First of all, it was a deck, I played against. It's not my invention. Second it's not that difficult to emptying the hand against slower opponents. Third it's for sure not an hyper competitive deck, but it gives Anka a place. I'm full aware of all your points, but I had some success with it today and that's why I wanted to share it. Didn't know, that we are only allowed to post possible tier1 or tier2 decks here. The deck is actually quiet fun because of the Burgle aspect, at least for me and if someone hit rank 5 already, he doesn't maybe care much about the Winrate of a deck."
CompetitiveHS,eyytill,t3_czia3q,1567601365.0,"I played against a very interesting Mechathun Quest Rogue yesterday and directly was in love with his deck. Everyone already knows about the interaction between Anka and Mechathun, but the main issue is to survive as a Rogue.
Why not try to play Mechathun and having fun at the same time with stealing some random stuff, which can maybe help to survive long enough?

Healing is included as well in form of good old Ziliax and Khartout Defender, which also gets reduced by Anka. Instead of Myra's, Octosari is included, which also benefits from Anka and doesn't always fatigue you on the spot when played. For more card draw we have Harisson and Plague of Madness.

Sadly my opponent was a douche, who emoted a lot. That's why I didn't add him and asked for the list. I tried to rebuild the deck from my memory and ended up with a build, which somehow works for me. But tbh, I only played two games on rank 5 with it today against slower decks. I'm sure, this deck will still struggle a lot against Aggro. The other small downside of this Mechathun Version is, that the outcome of the Burgle Cards can't be predicted. They could sometimes maybe be unplayable. 

But if you are facing a lot of Control Warrior and Quest Priests right now, this might be the list to try, if you like Burgle Rogue with an actual wincondition besides Tess.

Faced two slow decks, like Priest and Mage, but still. This deck can actually work, even though the Burgle Cards are unpredictable."

hearthstone,eyyp83h,t3_cz6p7h,1567597529.0,"I saw a very cool deck yesterday. The Rogue played the Quest and tons of minions, which allowed her to survive (Khartut Defender, Ziliax etc.)

Then ofc a good amount of burgle cards to finish the quest. She played Octosari instead of Myra's which as well got reduced by Anka.

The key factor of the deck was, that it was very minion heavy. Sadly my opponent was a douchebag who emoted a lot. I saw Mechathun coming after he or she played Anka, but I wanted to see all the other cards as well and that's why I sit through the already lost game. Didn't add my opponent, even though I really loved his deck and wanted to have the exact list, but his emotes discouraged me to send a friend request."
hearthstone,eyyoox9,t3_czhhj1,1567596999.0,"Both decks are strong but have clear counter. I wouldn't dust them, just try to counter decks you are facing a lot at certain ranks with a cheap aggro deck.
Don't de Tier 1 or Tier 2 decks, only to craft another meta deck. Just try out some cheap budget Aggro decks, like Aggro Warrior or Zoo to counter decks, you are facing a lot.

It's always a bad idea to fully de good decks, only because you don't like them atm."
hearthstone,eyyntbx,t1_eyx73m0,1567596092.0,"One of the fastest decks right now should be Aggro Warrior. I guess it's pretty cheap as well, if you don't include Grom. Games take like 6 minutes average. And it's not a bad deck either.

Old Beast Hunter with Dire Frenzy should still be a good deck as well, even though nobody is playing it right now. Zul'jin isn't needed, but ofc great in that deck. Without the Hero it's a nice budget more aggressive midrange deck. I would give it at least a try, if I would be a Hunter player. 

Then there is ofc still Token Druid, which is cheap as well, but I'm not sure about the powerlevel right now. Might be too weak in this meta."
hearthstone,eyymvs7,t3_cz4dko,1567595076.0,"I played yesterday against a Quest Warrior and I'm not an aggro player at all. I mostly play Combo or Control decks. Even though I played a very slow deck against him, he didn't win. It was close at the end and I was impressed of his cool and original deck, but it really showed how bad the Warrior Quest actually is. It can maybe work in an hyper aggressive build but still.

The Paladin quest is the most fun for me. I'm happy that it's a strong quest at the same time."
CompetitiveHS,eywibl6,t1_eyw30fa,1567530156.0,Good luck and hopefully you won't face many Warrior!
