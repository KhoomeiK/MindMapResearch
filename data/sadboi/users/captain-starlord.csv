Agender
Third gender

There are also gender identities like bigender or two spirit which I think fall under the same umbrella but don't quote me on that.

Not all trans people are non-binary and not all non-binary are trans. I personally am genderqueer and use/identify with the transgender adjective, mostly because I want to do some medical transition.

Existence of Non-binary peoples is also related to why ""gender confirmation surgery"" is more accurate and PC than ""sex reassignment surgery"" - having surgery to confirm gender, not flipping a switch between male and female or vice versa.

First, I'm so happy and excited for you! This is a big step and I know it can be terrifying. What helped me was having a letter. (I actually posted it to Facebook) I had come out to a couple extremely close friends one on one, but my big coming out was a letter on Facebook. 

I'd write out what you want to say, and be clear if you're up for questions at this point. I wasn't ready to be bombarded with questions at the time (two years ago yesterday) but I'm willing and able now. 

 If you're at a sleepover you could maybe have a video or a website up you could use to explore together. Maybe find an article or interview on a celebrity that has come out with the same identity. 

Just a couple ideas on breaking the ice or directing the conversation towards your very serious, VERY BIG AND EXCITING! moment. 

I was at my best friend's house, she helped me edit the letter and after it was posted she took me into the kitchen and reminded me it's a celebration to come out, and we did a shot together. Idk if you're of age, but even having martinellis or something would make the moment more special and remind everyone and yourself this is a happy moment. 

Good luck my dear, and you got this.

I had IEPs and 504s the whole way through high school. 

As an adult the trickiest thing for me is asking for accomodations and then having to point out I have hearing aids. Even now that I have short hair people don't always notice. There are some situations where I do point it out on purpose so people stop mumbling at me. 

I cover the front desk at work, and I had a woman come in for a job interview. I was getting her set up and she noticed I had hearing aids, and mentioned she left hers in the car. She was nervous it would be a discrimination issue. I told her it absolutely wouldn't be and she went and for them for the interview.

I'll do a written rundown here, but Sexplanations with Dr. Lindsay (sp) Doe will be an insanely helpful guide. Does rundowns of different acts including what gives pleasure to women, covers protection extensively, as well as just talking about sex in general to break down the taboos and educate people! 

My rundown/sex talk: (I'll focus on giving to the girl rather than receiving)

Foreplay is often desired and typically consists of kissing, biting, touching/grabbing (hair, breasts, butt) clit play, fingering, maybe oral if you're both into it.

Foreplay is key because as the woman gets turned on, her vagina will self lubricate (where ""wet pussy"" comes from) and relax/expand somewhat to make insertion more comfortable. Vaginas are insanely elastic, from holding a tampon in to birthing a baby and back again - so let it do its thing. Breaking the hymen is a misleading term, since that almost implies it covers the vagina. It's a muscular band around the rim of the vagina. 

Pleasure/sensitive centers- usually nipples, clit, and g-spot. Not all boobs have sensation (glares at my boobs) but they are veeeerrrrryy fun to play with. Clit is located on the outside of the body, between the labia(lip or flap of skin) and  just above the vagina. Rub it, lick it, whatever feels good for her and you're off to the races. G-spot is inside the vagina, imagine putting your middle and ring finger in, palm up, then make Spiderman hand, that's gonna get ya preeeeetty close. Not all ladies have it and certain positions work better for your penis to be hitting that sweet spot.

3 most basic positions are doggy style, missionary, and cowgirl. You may have a preference of those 3 from your m/m experiences, if you're still comfortable with it I'd start there. Doggy or cowgirl are better for g spot success. As you get more adventurous hooooooo boy you can experiment.

Protection and birth control is EXTREMELY KEY because you are bringing the baby making bits together now. (I had to change my approach when I started a relationship with a man) Lube is also your friend, oil based is nice but usually fucks with condoms. 

Only other thing is just finding a partner you can learn and communicate with!

Feel free to pm me if you have specific/awkward/whatever questions. Like I said, I've had sex with women before and I also have a vagina. :)"
TooAfraidToAsk,f0hbc67,t3_d4wbxq,1568617476.0,"I'd do whatever makes you feel safest; ""traditional"" life jackets (type I or II) are the safest and rated for most water types and situations (rough vs calm water, unconscious swimmer, etc) but are also the most unsightly and bulky. Probably avoid these bc of the embarrassment factor you mentioned. 

Type III can be jackets, vests, or even a coat, so has that safety factor without being obvious or bulky, but may still be too obvious depending on the type or your comfort level. 

Type V are inflatable or special use type jackets. There are inflatable ones that you wear like a vest and inflate into one of the first three types. OR!

Non-binary also tends to be an umbrella term for anyone who is gender non-conforming, but it is also an identification in the LGBTQ world with its own flag and everything.

It's really up to you how you want to identify or classify yourself. There are trans men who don't ""fully transition"" or transition at all. If you're feeling genderfluid but mostly prefer the masc side that works too. 

Gender non-conforming is another term that might fit what you're after since I saw your other comment about not really feeling non-binary.

There are also ways to non-medically transition. I personally wear GC2B binders which helps with the flatter chest, and I'd wear a suit rather than a formal dress for a special event, or shirt and tie instead of a skirt for business events. Day to day I generally dress pretty androgynous with t-shirts and jeans or colorful leggings.

Using it as a term for someone who has transitioned is potentially hurtful as it is still othering them, denying them their actual gender identity, and could even out them. 

A person who undergoes ""reassignment surgery"" - or more accurately, gender affirmation surgery - to be a man should be (and is) considered a man, not a woman who had surgery to become a man (making them a transexual woman)

Binary folks/general public would consider there to be two gender categories, men and women. We don't even need to say trans men or trans women. But using transexual makes it a little murkier- since it uses assigned at birth genders instead of preferred/actual genders.

Words like transexual and related variations (transvestite, tranny, etc) are also be approaching that level of avoidance but not as much as it should.  

A word like Queer is in a weird overlap of some people reclaiming it (like myself) but the generations that were oppressed/demeaned by that word are still around and hate the usage.

This is all my own opinion but I've been in or seen discussions on this and similar topics."

NonBinary,ey6owiy,t1_ey6lsqk,1566860589.0,"Yes. I had emailed to ask about it when I learned about the process in WA for amending birth certificates. I think there just has to be a legal document showing the preferred gender. And Im pretty sure it does allow for M/F/X

I wasn't born in Utah so idk about birth certificate changes or legal process for changing gender markers here.

Edit: found an article regarding the IDs. https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/utah-among-growing-number-states-issuing-gender-neutral-ids-n984326
Requires birth certificate or passport to update gender on ID, but as passport doesn't do an X option, it would have to be your birth certificate. I'm fortunate in that Washington only requires a notarized request form for the change."

I'm genderqueer myself, and consider myself trans. My preferred name is a shortened form of my legal name so it gets out eventually. I did have one partner that wanted and almost insisted on calling me by my full name. That was definitely weird and one of many reasons she's an ex now."

If it's a matter of reclamation (i.e. I personally identify as queer/genderqueer) then it's more of an empowerment thing. Taking back and re-establishing those terms as ours.

If you plan on getting one, you could get that going before you change everything over. (I believe there were some special policies for trans individuals, like 5 year passpt instead of 10 yrs so the pic is more accurate. Idk if you are/plan to do hrt.)

I haven't yet received my new certificate so can't get my license updated yet (I'm in UT) so I don't know how traveling goes. I don't believe the tickets have gender listed on them - all TSA is really checking for is that the name matches on both, and that you're the person in the picture.

These are federal (!!!) protections that grant rights to those with illness or disability - and sounds like your situation falls under this category. Part of these federal acts say that if a reasonable accommodation can be made that doesn't affect the function of the job (i.e. allowing extra breaks or a stool to lean on at the counter) the employer must allow it. I've not dealt with a union before, but I'd imagine your union reps would know about these accomodation protections and how to get them for you.

trans,ewn5c9h,t3_cp46os,1565568969.0,"Binders should be pretty snug but not to the point of constricting breathing. If there's gaps in the armhole type thing it may be worth sizing down. I can't quite tell from the picture if it's too loose or not. They will also stretch out a little bit so if things already shift around as you wear it, it's going to get worse. 

It looks like a gc2b binder to me - if it is, they're pretty good about troubleshooting sizing issues and exchanges and things.

genderqueer,ewm38jq,t3_coyln9,1565542187.0,"Another term to consider might be gender fluid. Tends to imply you exist on the gender spectrum somewhere but not necessarily at male end or female end. I also define queer as whatever you want it to be - kind of an all encompassing ""other"" that doesn't fit into the male/female/trans labels. 

I struggled with using bi myself as I identify as genderqueer - since in my head I defined it as hetero+homo aka same gender and opposite gender. I didn't really have a gender, so same/opposite didn't work in my head haha. 

I  used pan for a while, until I happened upon omnisexual. A lot of the definition/differentiation between pan and omni is related to partner gender preference, and that gender is part of the attraction where pan it's not (attraction to all genders without regard for gender)

genderqueer,ewk7vka,t3_comraw,1565477773.0,"I'm not strictly in the same situation, but have a couple ideas! I'm AFAB and identify as genderqueer, I tend to operate masc of center in public. 

As far as large breasts go, I completely feel that issue(38G myself). If you don't mind wearing a binder during intimate times, those would definitely flatten you out. GC2B has a collection of skin tones of multiple colors so it could blend in if you want, or get something fun like purple or blue!

Now this is something that depends on whether you're a top or bottom, and what you two are comfortable with intimacy wise. But a strap on might help you feel empowered and more on the male end of the spectrum during intimacy. There's all different kinds, so it may be something to explore together to see what you're comfortable with. 

This might be super basic but you could also try a ""want, will, won't"" list. There's a YouTube video that explains it a bit, (""how to get the sex you want"" by sexplanations.)and it helped me when I was in a relationship with a woman that had sexual trauma. The host of sexplanations - Dr Doe - is fantastic and the whole channel is full of info.

I have a bit of gender dysphoria related to my vagina, so with male partners and penis in vagina sex, it's a matter of communication of what I'm comfortable with and what feels good. (I.e. I can't have my limbs this certain way, this position doesn't work for me, etc)

Feel free to ask me any follow up! It was (and is) a long journey to being comfortable enough with my body to enjoy intimate moments, so anything I can do I will."
