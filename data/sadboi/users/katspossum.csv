fuckeatingdisorders,fgtzlnf,t3_f0ddxu,1581111359.0,"Obviously I can‚Äôt actually see you but from my own experience, when I went through a binge eating fruit phase of half recovery/half trying to still appease my ED by eating natural sugar, I experienced a TON of bloating, which would make me look like I had a double chin. Most likely, the amount of fiber you‚Äôre consuming makes you feel like you‚Äôre gaining a lot of weight because it is causing you to retain water and bloat. 
If you want to eat fruit, eat the damn fruit. Your bloating will subside with consistent eating. Bloating will continue if you binge and restrict. 
Also if you want the fruit and you don‚Äôt eat it, you‚Äôre going to eventually binge either on fruit or some other sugary food. So may as well eat the fruit until you just don‚Äôt want as much anymore. Trust me, your body will know when to stop, even if it takes what seems like a long time.
If you are only eating fruit because you‚Äôre craving something sugary and are thus trying to restrict by not allowing yourself to have something like chocolate, then have the chocolate. The fruit may not be satisfying you the way the chocolate would, so you just keep eating it trying to find that satisfaction that never comes.
Whatever you do, just eat. You‚Äôre going to be okay."

If it helps you in any way, just know that this post had an impact on me. I struggle with suicidal thoughts, but I never want to make another person feel the way that you do. Imagining my boyfriend writing this post breaks my heart. This opened my eyes to that, and I will try to keep this post in my mind when I am at my lowest points. I am so sorry for your loss."
EDAnonymous,f5un0xf,t1_f5ujwvw,1572476122.0,"Exactly. I definitely enjoy food more while restricting, and I am constantly sleeping now as well. Please let me know if you find that the antidepressant helps you. I am desperate."

fuckeatingdisorders,f5aksnp,t3_dncmws,1572109292.0,"If you are truly not losing weight anymore from eating so little calories, it is because your body has gone into starvation mode where now it will hold onto all of the food you intake because you are literally starving. As scary as it is, you have to increase your caloric intake to an amount that is still a deficit but won‚Äôt cause your body to starve in order to get out of your plateau. This will also avoid binges."

fuckeatingdisorders,f4dd8qq,t3_dkbe7p,1571541044.0,"I know this feeling.. i felt it today. Only mine was with peanut butter and I‚Äôve done it twice this week. I force myself to throw up but not everything comes out, and then I fast and exercise a lot to try and compensate. I‚Äôve tried laxatives before to purge, but I am so scared of laxative dependency that I‚Äôve stopped doing that. I know your feelings of frustration and guilt. It sucks."
fuckeatingdisorders,f4c2zpc,t3_djsvud,1571522777.0,"I have struggled since puberty with the way that I look. I have never been diagnosed but what I have dealt with is similar to what body dysmoprhia is described as. It‚Äôs an obsession and what I see in the mirror dictates my mood. I was also raped multiple times by a family member throughout my childhood that I suffer PTSD from, and I had been through a lot with my parents being addicted to meth during the latter years of my childhood, and these things made me feel like I had no control of my life. The summer that my eating disorder started I was the most insecure I have ever been in life, in all aspects, not just my appearance. I think it developed out of feeling the need to have control over something, and that if I could be skinny then I would be pretty and all of my problems would suddenly go away. Not the case, unfortunately. Have been in ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù since last October, I am at a normal weight but I still struggle with relapses of both restricting and purging. Hoping that I can be whatever ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is someday"
EDAnonymous,f3o8r4l,t1_f3o2ts0,1571011349.0,"Insane how similar what I am going through is to what you are. I hope we get better and start normalizing the amount of food we eat and feel satisfied mentally. It worries me to let go of calorie counting apps even when it‚Äôs during a surplus because I‚Äôm so scared of losing control, and ending up overweight. However, I‚Äôm sure that would probably not happen and I would eventually just eat like a normal person"
EDAnonymous,f3d07na,t1_f3b7s2m,1570830284.0,Please. Eat.
