There are a few clinics in there with sliding scales and such. A lot of city hospitals also have sort of income based services where they treat you as outpatient at their hospitals and clinics on a sliding scale as well. There are a number of online places for behavior health but I've never tried any. What worked for me was finding someone who was willing to work with me.

You've just gone from the health insurance to no health insurance route. It's tough. Doctors aren't going to treat you the same and things are going to be expensive, time consuming, and frustrating as hell. You're going to get the run around, put on hold forever, you're going to have to call a million times. All these affordable clinics take time, so expect to make your appointments a few weeks to months in advanced and it will be packed when you get there. But it's not impossible.

It was really brave and scary what you did and I hope you're even a little proud of how far you've come."
