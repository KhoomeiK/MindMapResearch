She said that psychopaths/sociophats are scary and dangerous. A therapist!? I ddidn't like her  saying that. The videos with Shane has  billions views, and she said that so nonchanantly, like psychopaths are all dangerous and you should avoid them.

I agree with you. People with this diagnosis are not the devil incarnate, some do crimes and negative things to others, but not everyone. I judge the single person, if they do bad things then I avoid them but not just bc one is a psychopath then I avoid them altogether, depends on how they behave towards me."

But now this new person im seeing, i suspect hes one. Since i only fall in love with them and not normal people, this new one has to be one too (or he has traits). He also has a vacant empty gaze most of the time like no one is there. Ive noticed a lot of narcissists have the same gaze (my father for example). 

We like what is familiar. I saw a youtube video about this. If i find it ill link here. The person talked abt toxic relationships. She said ""You Meet this person and think they are perfect, it seems like ive known them all my life. Yes, because Its your father!"". Meaning that you probably are attracted to them bc they remind you of toxic caregivers and family dynamics.

I watched videos and read things on reddit. 

One thing, don't always challenge the thoughts. You are not your thoughts, but what you choose to do, and your actions.

Allow the thoughts to come and go, practice mindfulness which you can do in a few minutes. Notice the emotions and other thoughts that arise (like feeling tense or saying to yourself ""i shouldnt have this thought"").

Dont indulge in these thoughts they are not real and wont happen.

Try guided meditation and relaxation (i recommend michael sealy on youtube). 

If too intense, try therapy and medication (a med changed my life for the best!)."
BPD,fkkm2qq,t3_fiymrl,1584287087.0,"I used to do that in high school (age 15/16 mostly). Especially when listening to music. I created a fantasy world and I was the hero. I interacted with characters, found love, saved the world. I don't do that anymore bc I recognize it was maladaptive and didn't give me anything. 

I stopped doing that as I grew older, I think bc I started to be more involved in my own real life, started dong things that I liked (jobs, found friends etc). 

One thing you could do is to write those scenarios down and maybe start by writing stories. The positive thing is that you have great imagination, you can use that to write or even paint. You probably have vivid images when you fantasize, why not using that to paint something or creating something IRL? 

I'm not good at drawing/painting but I would do that. Materialize your fantasies into the real world. 

Also meditation and especially yoga helped me a lot. They got me out of my mind. Especially yoga is good, so you start to focus on your body and not on your fantasies. You get out of your mind. Or with mindfulness."

You are right i should move on. He said hes not over the previous relationship and i understand that. But then why he decided to write me and ask me out??

He was with this person 7 years, said ended badly. She only liked certain posts not everything. Also he said they opened the couple but this other person seems non existant. Like why not get back with them instead? He never mentions them to others so they were a secret. A friend that knows him told me that he said his ex cheated on him. Im kinda suspicios too, but maybe im overreacting. I mean, i too am in good terms with my ex.

And I'm afraid about the poly thing. What if we are together (in a distant future), and he wants to open the couple? He did that in his previous relationship he said, before it ended. I never tried being with multiple partners, but I think my jealousy could be an issue. I'm afraid that this scenario will become real, then what?

I would say work on these issues in therapy. Work on your abandonent fears, don't stop dating because of these but at the same time don't put the other person on a pedestal. Focus on yourself and find distractions in your hobbies, passions. Try things to do that don't involve the other person. This way you don't put him at the center of your life. Don't forget about yourself, that you are important and this is your life, you should be the priority.

Also talking to your person about your fears and worries could help, if you feel like he will listen and understand. But if you two just started seeing each other, maybe not."
