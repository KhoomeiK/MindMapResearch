When you break ground you might not even get to finish the plant before it gets cancelled for one reason or another.

Even if they manage to get built and stay running cheap power from natural gas may make running  the reactor at a loss. The federal government needs to take over nuclear in the United State's building them on federal land and using new Navy personnel would be a good start in killing fossil fuels while at the same time adding a certain level of protection that the plant could operate until the end of its designs life time."

BipolarReddit,fr3uvox,t3_glsm4s,1589866933.0,"I have had about 60 treatments, i would have more but the hospital stopped doing elective procedures unless it is an emergency. 

&#x200B;

The breaking point for me was:

I was severly depressed, so much so that i wasnt eating and it was hard to eat. i was also only able to drink water without feeling worse. In 5 weeks i ate maybe a total of 2k calories. i lost about 35 lbs, went from low 210s to the mid 70s.

I was pretty much non-functional. Working was hard as fuck. I ran a small department of around 20 people. I had to make a list of shit i needed to do and force myself to get through it. I was either at work for 10+ hours or left shortly after my boss left \~5 hours. I had no energy (not eating + depression) other people noticed and it was pretty common for the people that i knew to offer to buy me food.

My daughter was born about 3 months before and I told myself that my goal was to see her turn 18. This hasnt stopped some of my behaviors unfortunately.

I started to self-harm.

I tried to commit suicide.

I was going on almost a year of depression that was only getting worse.

Meds wernt working.

The suicide attempt resulted in a trip to the ER where they gave me the choice of volunteering to be a 3 day hold or being forced to. I volunteered because you can lose some of your civil rights over the long term.

I failed or stop showing up to most of my classes (at-least it was for a 2nd bachelors). I was unable to focus or concentrate, everything felt like a fog.

I had pretty good insurance so i was able to get pre-authorized to stay just over 4 weeks in the hospital while i did ECT. The hospital normally only required 2 weeks but i lived 8 hours away and it was the closest hospital and one of the best in the country. I got treatments 3 days a week. They did treatments around 5 am then took you back to your room to sleep, which is fucking impossible when they mainline you with caffeine. The hospital and the staff were helpful too since they filled half your day with different types of therapeutic activities.

&#x200B;

My second stay and round of treatments was about a year or later. The things out lined above were starting to reoccur so i new it was time to go again. This time it was just over a 2 week stay. the experience was a little different because they didnt have enough rooms (ECT patients got their own rooms) in the ward for lower risk patients for the first 3 days. 

&#x200B;

I quit my job, it wasnt a rash decision. When my wife finished graduate school we were gonna find jobs in our home town and move back. Which we did. My insurance was pretty shitty and barely covered regular visits. There was a hospital doing ECT about 30 minutes away but they had just started doing it. We decided to get jobs near the first hospital. I got a job that payed slightly more and had way better insurance. I did probably a dozen treatments. I then quit that job because i decided i wanted to go a different direction with my life and started trade school.

&#x200B;

I had to go on my wifes insurance which didnt use the same hospital system. There was another hospital that is pretty good and in the same area so it wasnt a big deal to switch. Ive only done 9 treatments through them because of COVID.

If you are married i strongly recommend letting your spouse or significant other be involved in the treatments and everything that surrounds them. You will need the help and support of other people.

**The Results:**

It helped a lot. My depression lifted enough that meds were actually helping.

I wasnt suicidal

i started eating again and was able to function normally

I felt ""normal"" for the first time in a long time but over time meds started to lose their effect and compliance was also becoming harder.

Memory loss is a real issue. I have only done bi-frontal which has the lowest effect on memory. I still lost a lot of memory and i know it, I know i know something but just cant recall it or the memory is completely or atleast partially gone. ( i have faked it a few times to avoid arguing with my wife)

Some of my normal functionality was gone. I basically forgot or couldnt do some tasks.

&#x200B;

Their is a lot more to it and i am happy to answer questions but ive covered most of the high points of my experience (i think). It is not an easy choice but for me it was the right one."

A huge problem with nuclear is the power stations are a huge investment and  take years get approved and years to build. If oil/gas/coal is cheap enough the power stations may get canceled mid build. I really think the US government should build and run nuclear powers stations even if its at a loss. The US navy  has a perfect record at running reactors and would be the perfect fit for running power stations. It would help kill off oil/gas/coal but there is also a vested interest by those in power to keep oil/gas/coal up and running.

It had a positive void coefficient meaning that if the water boiled in the core or was absent it would actually increase the energy output. reactors in the ""western world"" typically had a negative void coefficient meaning that you basically without water they would decrease energy output. Which doesn't mean a melt down is impossible but makes it less likely and gives you more time to shut the reactor down safely. some designs have an electromagnet holding up a massive weight with control rods attached. If power was lost the control rods would fall and shut down the reactor."

I talked to my union dispatcher today and for my particular rank/status I probably wont see any work until July or August. Our union has somewhere around 500 people on the bench waiting for work. Our union is also helping and encouraging us to help one another through debt counseling and a food pantry.

The only silver lining is that unemployment is paying out more than i would make if i was working. I am able to stash away enough money each week so that if/when unemployment runs out i will have several more months worth of cash saved up."
askscience,fq8wnzd,t3_gh3a0a,1589177734.0,"Plate tectonics and erosion reshape the earth's surface constantly. Their only exist a few small regions on earth where material older than 300my (I think) exists. The moon, mercury, venus and mars all do not have plate tectonics like the earth does. Water may be a requirement of plate tectonics. With the exception of venus their is no real atmosphere to speak of. The density of air on the surface of mars is less than 1% of earth's. (IMO making mars kinda a boring planet to study). Venus while like plate tectonics has some kind of mechanism that we have discovered yet that reshapes the surface every few hundred million years. Its surface pressure is 92 times the density of earths.


All the planets are unique. Earth has all the right conditions for global resurfacing. Venus has some wierd shit going on that we should be putting more time into studying. Mars is just kinda meh any manned exploration of mars will be just like building a space station on its surface."
askscience,fq8vi7c,t3_gh083r,1589176727.0,"More advanced submarines such as missile subs and hunter killer subs have coatings that absorb sonar quite well. They also go through extensive measures to insure that the sub doesn't emit sound that could be detected. Passive coolant flow in their reactors is one such measure. Crew behavior is another one. Parts also wear over time. I cant remember exactly which sub it was (Soviet I think) but the could detect it based on rhythmic  noise emitted from a worn bearing.

Also advanced detection of submarines in most nations is gonna probably fall under ""born secret"". Meaning the government will come in and take any and all research related to it. For all we know the technology  exists that has no problem tracking even advanced subs."

HIV is actually a pretty delicate virus when outside a cell. Its protein coat isn't really made to be outside its host. Just about anything can kill it. Sunlight, most disinfects, soap, sanitizer, even low heat. So transmission is pretty hard difficult for the virus. Sexual contact (really and blood to body transmission. Sex causes micro tears) and blood are its main carriers so it derives some protection by not leaving the human body or its specific fluids.

I hate what blizzard has done to most of their games. They're all basically single player games where you encounter other people. Everyone can deck themselves out in epic gear without saying a single word to anyone else.  PvP is a joke and Overwatch has felt pretty hollow since they have forced 2-2-2 in quick play and competitive. OW forcing 2-2-2 doesnt create a balanced team, it just results in people queing as healers and tanks and just using damage abilities and not healing or tanking.

&#x200B;

Maybe Im a bit nostalgic but I liked the MMO Dark Age of Camelot. All of the classes could bring something to the table in both PvP and Pve. Eight man groups were great, a healer, tank and a support class such as a minstrel and you could fill the rest of the group with whatever. The game was a fucking grind though doing goblins and trees for 100+ hours to get from 40 to 50 sucked. The grind did result in two things that are missing in blizzards games - You learned to use your class and its all of its abilities and you found out that reputation was important. If you wanted any sort of help or guild/group you couldn't go around with this 12yo shit of calling everyone fags, retarded or stupid copy pasta and all the other bullshit.

askscience,fp8ster,t3_gb9s4r,1588401823.0,"Nothing really other than the lack of political will. Bill Clinton effectively killed nuclear power plants and the possibility of reprocessing spent fuel. With the right reactor and adjacent reprocessing facilities we could effectively use up almost all the energy in nuclear fuel an literally through what's left into a landfill. Currently we use a once through cycle and it only extracts something like 5% of the energy in the fuel.

The nuclear proliferation concerns in the US are fucking stupid. The left in America has basically relied on the stupidly of most Americans both left and right to kill nuclear power. The US has no problems with nuclear security for fuck sake we have found that storing nuclear waste in parking lots is actually a pretty safe place and allows for better security and the ability to monitor the waste much easier than burying it. The plutonium in the waste is pretty hard to turn into a nuclear weapon (ignoring dirty bombs) because it contains significant quantities of plutonium 240. Pu-240 emits enough neutrons that creating a critical mass is a pretty hard obstacle to overcome the only way to do it would result in a bomb that is impractical to build and use. With the right reactor design tou can burn up all the uranium and plutonium in a fuel load.

Pandoras promise is a pretty good documentary on nuclear power. In the us the only major reactor accidents are SL-1 and three mile island. SL-1 killed its 3 operators and TMI killed no one. Fear mongering, not science is the reason nuclear fuel is crippled in the US and most of that blame falls on the actions of the political left.


Down vote me and hate me all you want cause I know most redditors that do are gonna he to fucking stupid to face reality and on this particular issue have are worse than the Republicans in their denial of science.

I will also add that a 1 cubic centimeter 
cube that is reactor fuel has more usable energy than 50000 barrels of oil. It weighs 19 grams, a full load of fuel in a breeder reactor a typical reactor load is 100,000,000 grams or 263 million barrels of oil worth of energy."
worldnews,fp84yj8,t1_fp7ifvq,1588383630.0,"6.5 is not identical in any of the dimensions as the 223. 300BO is based off of a modified 223 case and 6.5 grendel is based off of a 7.62x39 case.

&#x200B;

6.5 grendel (7.62x39 parent case):  Rim (bottom most part of the case) diameter: 11.2mm

223 rem (300 BO parent case): base diameter 9.6mm

only way to change rim diameter would be to mill it down, no way to increase it.

&#x200B;

Googling the dimensions for all 4 cartridges will yield images with critical measurements for all 4 cases. if you chamber a 300BO into a 223 rifle best case scenario youve ruined only part of the rifle, worst case is severe injury and possible death. 223, 300BO and 6.5Gren will not chamber into a 7.62x39 rifle.  7.63x39 and 6.5 gren will not chamber into 233 and 300BO. 233 will not chamber into 300bo and 6.5gren will not chamber into 7.62x39.

**Assuming factory loading and a rifles with an 18 inch barrela. In reality the 300bo is made to shoot from short barrels as short as 6.5"" and a 6.5 Grendel  24"" or longer. The other 2 fall in between. Then:**

Internal ballistics (from the chamber to the end of the barrel) wise - all 4 cartridges different. Each cartridge requires a different kind and amount of powder.

Exterior ballistics (from the barrel to the target) are going to be different, with the 6.5 beating out the other 3 for max a range and a supersonic loading of 300bo could be made to mimic 7.62x39. 6.5 will travel the furthest and be the most accurate, followed by 223, then 300bo and 7.62x39.

Terminal ballistics are tricky. if you assume that similar bullets are used and 300 meters is the distance to the target. Using full metal jacket bullets the 223 will do the most damage with the other 3 most likely traveling right through the target. If you used a hollow points then the 6.5 would most likely cause the most damage followed by 223, the 300bo and 7.62x39 would be similar, possibly the 300bo preforming better than 7.62x39 since it is a more accurate cartridge."
