No. It's not. She has another pet there, and for all I know, her child is observing this behavior, and will most likely mimic it. Would you rather this child grow up abusing animals thinking it's ok to slap and punch them at your discretion, or would you rather the dogs get to a safe place, and someone else in the family teach them better? Again, this kid is not my concern, and whatever the law does concerning where this child is placed, is not my business. My business is taking those animals out of harms way."

relationship_advice,fa1btap,t3_e7hqeq,1575767821.0,"Listen OP. As someone who literally just got out of a mentally and emotionally abusive relationship, I feel as though this man isn't, and will never be, right for you. He is manipulative, and turning his destructive behavior around on you. He sees you in a emotional state, and uses this to his advantage. I'm not telling you what to do, but in my personal opinion, he is not, and probably will never be willing to change. If he's 55, and he's still acting like a child, then I'm afraid it is a choice of his own to be demeaning and cruel. You might feel lost and upset if you leave him, but you and your mental health should come before anyone. You will eventually feel a huge weight lifted off your shoulders. I hope you feel better, OP. Just stay strong, and put yourself first."
