uofmn,fr1qdty,t1_fqtnus7,1589824168.0,i looked at BBE hasnt denied a student in 3 years because of GPA. it really just depends on what program you go for
uofmn,fqnzn6q,t3_gjvavd,1589504572.0,i doubt the department will stray from aleks. i know they've been asked to many times and they continue to stand with the program
uofmn,fqghh0q,t1_fqgh5zh,1589346387.0,"i’ve been told that you only need a tech gpa above 3.0 for certain programs like comp sci, chemE and BME. my friend in mechE said that for most programs a 3.0 tech gpa is good"
depression,fqgfbcw,t3_gibavz,1589344810.0,College gives me a purpose and adds structure to my life. I work hard in class and it makes me feel smart and better about myself. I've found that without school I feel unproductive and worse about myself
Sororities,fqgexvq,t3_gine3m,1589344539.0,"just out of curiosity, what school do you go to?"
uofmn,fqgdl81,t3_ginzj7,1589343584.0,i've had pretty decent stem professors. I had a great calc 2 prof and my PHYS1301 1 professor was fine. my MATH 2374 professor kind of sucked but he wasn't horrible. I think a lot of STEM professors have lower ratings because people are less inclined to highly rate a professor who's class is more difficult.
uofmn,fqdxw7j,t3_ghwkmo,1589298493.0,"Most grad students live in Uptown which is a little far from campus and so you wont really get the undergrad feeling of living on campus. It's a nice area and you'd be next to the lakes which I think is great. Marcy Holmes is pretty cheap but the neighborhood sees a lot of crime, we had 3 attempted kidnappings in the neighborhood just this past year. also a majority of the sororities are on the edge of Marcy Holmes and campus so if you were to live in Marcy I'd recommend getting a place at least 5-6 blocks from campus if you dont want to be around the undergrads."
uofmn,fqdx2pp,t3_gi9rez,1589298093.0,"practice your integrals and u-subs, you want to know those really well because calc 2 starts out running from that. On my tests there were like a few multiple choice problems but they weren't really conceptual but more like ""how would you find this"" and it basically is asking how to set up a problem. Just practice practice practice and you should be alright, also take advantage of the math lab (if its open lol) and check out professor leonard on youtube"
uofmn,fqdwchw,t1_fqcb4iv,1589297733.0,did you really live in centen if you didn't spend a majority of your flexdine at the c-store?
uofmn,fqdw4zy,t3_ghxbim,1589297630.0,I didn't live in a single but I did live in an expanded single in centen (a little larger single but it houses 2 people) and I honestly think living in a single gives you the best of both worlds. I loved having a roommate and we lived really well together but I  sometimes wish I had my own room just to be alone for a little bit. My hall got along pretty well and we all became friends pretty fast. I would recommend centennial just because you'd be with a building full of people who are all in singles as well. I didn't even know pio had singles so I'm assuming they all aren't in their own hall which would be harder because most people stick to their own in double halls. I knew almost everyone in my hall and I was friends with about half of them but I noticed most of my peers in double rooms in other dorms only were friends with a couple people. You do have to make some effort initially but everyone is also making an effort to make friends during welcome week so its not a huge deal.

Sororities,fpimw9d,t3_gdk6yc,1588644236.0,i was super nervous about rushing/being in a sorority because i'm bisexual and i was afraid most girls would judge me for it but a huge chunk of people in my sorority are apart of the LGBT+ community! i have not once had a bad incident with someone in my chapter being disrespectful.

uofmn,foul5ll,t1_fouki3z,1588086057.0,I'm a current freshman and the only classes I could take at CC next year are Linear Alg and Chemistry. I think some engineers could get away w taking an engineering class at a community college but I'm in BBE which isn't really a program anywhere else.
uofmn,foukaw3,t1_foujab3,1588085628.0,Yeah I was speaking for the incoming freshmen. I'm in engineering and a semester at CC would delay my graduation :/
uofmn,fouj6it,t3_g96vnp,1588085045.0,"honestly, just take some gen eds at a community college (make sure they transfer) if fall 2020 is online. it’ll save u a whole bunch of money and you won’t be behind."
AskReddit,fnwr22n,t3_g3w1uu,1587323767.0,"My sophomore year of high school, my principal went on the loudspeaker on 9/11 to recognize the importance of the day and have a moment of silence. My principal was a large southern man who was in terrible health and during the moment of silence, he forgot to turn off the microphone. This caused for his loud heavy breathing to play on the loud speaker across our entire high school. It was terrible but everyone was trying so hard to not laugh."
uofmn,fmbala8,t3_ftzfnd,1585922373.0,"calc 2 is like the worst class to happen to me, i never did any better than an 80% on the weekly quizzes. i wouldnt sweat it, its a tough class and now its online."

college,fly89pz,t1_flxz3b5,1585597368.0,"that's the thing, our professor has literally given us all the PERFECT opportunity to cheat on this exam. no proctors at all and an extra 2 hours has been given to us to complete the test. he said he's gonna try and make the test a little harder so there wont be a huge advantage for it being open note but i have no clue how he'd right a test question that would make computational engines useless."
college,flxmt51,t1_flxmhwx,1585585926.0,OP is concerned about her grade being trashed because of skewed class averages. OP has talked to 6 people in the class and they all said they will most likely be using these problem solving processors to check answers before submitting
college,flxmga2,t1_flxm915,1585585736.0,it absolutely matters because in a difficult class like multivariable calc the gradelines of the course are dependent on the exam score averages. if i dont cheat and get a B but the class average is an A because everyone else cheats then im in trouble.
college,flxm585,t1_flxm2qi,1585585570.0,im basically wondering if i should contribute to the problem and cheat or dont
college,flxlypj,t1_flxlvo0,1585585473.0,if others cheat the class average will be skewed and the curve wont be as generous

relationships,fle3qj6,t1_fle2c4m,1585077029.0,he posted on his finsta about me a little but a majority of the stuff was on his reddit and im pretty sure very few of his friends follow that. i think he wanted to feel like the victim in the situation bc he was hurt too. who knows.
relationships,fle1oj8,t1_fldzyr1,1585075920.0,i mean he apologized a bunch and obsessively posted about how cheating on me and leaving me was the biggest regret he’s ever had. but he was almost flipping the situation on himself and making himself the victim. i used to see this breakup as how it made me stronger and it did in a way but it also really fucked me up emotionally. i constantly think people secretly dont like me and im always afraid of my friends one day getting sick of me and leaving.
relationships,fle0xks,t1_fldxtnu,1585075511.0,i went to a therapist like 7 months after the breakup bc it kinda caused a string of bad events but it wasnt really for me and i stopped going after 4 months. i talked to my boyfriend about how it was affecting me in the past but im afraid to talk abt how i currently feel. i can talk to him abt almost anything but im afraid he’d be upset w me for still talking abt an ex from years ago

MDMA,f6hg22e,t1_f62y84g,1572846829.0,im not sure how i felt abt it. at some parts it was really really great and i felt bliss but then in a second i'd feel nauseous and too fucked up. it was really inconsistent so i get why its called rolling lol. the rave was a cool environment but because the molly and the surroundings were so unfamiliar it was a lot to take in. but we left the rave and just hung out at home. the drive home was rlly satisfying and relaxing. at home we could just talk and smoke a little.i don't regret rolling i overall had a pretty positive experience.
MDMA,f4vskp3,t1_f4vpakh,1571847188.0,yes his dealer tested it in front of him and the dealer is very trustworthy. i havent had much traumatic stuff happen to me. shrooms kinda did something similar where i felt like i was being honest to myself. the rave we're going to has a quiet area we can go to and i've been seeing my boyfriend for almost a year so im comfortable opening up to him. im really just worried about any sort of comedown depression

Summer classes are more difficult and require a lot more commitment and time than full term classes. I never took a physics course but the bio and calc classes I took were fine. profs are hit or miss so make sure you get a good one and use RMP
