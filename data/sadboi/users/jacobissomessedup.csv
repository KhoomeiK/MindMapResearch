Makeup,fm0wqo3,t3_frdn9j,1585667680.0,"So if they’re red I put green concealer or color corrector on first and if they’re purple I put on an orange concealer or color corrector first. DONT use the foundation or concealer you normally use on your face because it most likely won’t match. You’ll want to put on a concealer over the blended color corrector. I recommend Jeffree stars, elf camo concealer, tarte shape tape, or juvias place. Don’t layer it just put enough on to make it look natural then it won’t get on your clothes. After hat set it with a translucent setting powder. Any work. If you really wanna make it look real you can get a tiny tiny tiny amount of blush so your arm doesn’t have an unnaturally even color. You can even go in with eyeliner or brow products to draw on the hairs of your arm so you can see your hairs again but this is totally optional. I have used this technique for covering scars when preforming the half time show at my school and it works great. My scars don’t show up on the 4K photos and I feel confident AF."

Makeup,fm0v9um,t3_fs1l7x,1585666856.0,If you put the darker (crews contour) color a little higher than your actual crease it will give the illusion that your eyes aren’t as hooded. Nikki tutorials uses this method for her hooded eyes:)
Makeup,fm0v3le,t1_fm0uyd8,1585666757.0,Thanks for the info :) I just found an article on their website that says they clean the warehouse often so it could be extended up to 12 days for shipping and they’re only allowing a few ppl to work.
