Once I work down to 175lb I plan on shooting for my ideal BMI if it‚Äôs not already hit and/or find a better ideal weight to work to! 

Setting a final weight goal is all fine and dandy but it‚Äôs going to be a while before u see it unless u lose the weight in an unhealthy manner! Setting goals as u go will stop u from trying to give up and helps keeping up the same energy seeing quicker achievements!"

A lot of colleges have childcare and programs in place to have it for free. Ur also the asshole because I get ur sister. I had a baby at 18 I worked when the baby was 4 months because my parents wanted me to establish a schedule and bond with my baby before heading off to work. I‚Äôm 24 now and starting college in august. So what that my schedule worked a little backwards I still got shit done! 

Life doesn‚Äôt happen the same for everyone. Sometimes people timelines changed. This is ur sisters timeline let her continue it and support the fact that she actually wants a degree to help their future!"
findareddit,ff02oyy,t3_eqzibs,1579464520.0,A lot of subs about the mental illness is thrilled to hear from spouses of those suffering! I follow a page for PTSD and ask questions and talk to people to help my fianc√© more nobody tells me that I‚Äôm not welcome there because I don‚Äôt have ptsd their just happy I‚Äôm trying and willing to talk to me as a spouse going through it without judging me for getting overwhelmed with it
AmItheAsshole,ff00q23,t1_ff008ue,1579463950.0,It is. But u shouldn‚Äôt have to stay with someone because they have a mental Illness! Everyone has a right to leave someone when they become to much to handle. If she ends up getting diagnosed with kleptomania and OP thinks that the breaking point then they have every right to leave that relationship. She needs to learn how to help herself before she expects others to put her needs before theirs.
AmItheAsshole,fezxoxx,t1_fexopqr,1579463054.0,"My fianc√© definitely has kleptomania but that does not mean he can take anything he wants without consequences. Stealing is still illegal. If someone who is psychopathic decides to go out an hurt someone they don‚Äôt magically let assault charges go! 

If you have a mental illness seek help and find coping skills that help!"

If ur interested enough in law to become a lawyer than go for it! It‚Äôs worth a shot AND who knows u may influence others with dyslexia!"
