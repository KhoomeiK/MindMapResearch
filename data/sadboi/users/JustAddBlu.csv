I'm wondering how I can use a mic with this camera, maybe an external recorder? Does it work like that, plugging a shotgun mic into my phone or an external recorder?"

Range/Speed: Speed is only an issue if I'm riding in traffic, which I might be. Range is important. 

  
Terrain: Sidewalks and paved roads. Mostly all flat, maybe some uphills. 

Weight and size: Not an issue

Price range: Around $700

Special features: Fast charger? It would be good to have lights and a good remote."

u_getnexar,ff28b95,t3_eiwc4j,1579496730.0,"Not funny, didn't laugh. Your joke is so bad I would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up re-telling me the joke. To be honest this is a horrid attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me. Not a chuckle, not a hehe, not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus. Science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but I didn't even feel the slightest twitch. 0/10 this joke is so bad I cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all. The amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on Earth. Get a personality and learn how to make jokes, read a book. I'm not saying this to be funny I genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy. You've single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet. I'm so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny. Honestly if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff. You're lucky I still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise I would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again. We should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary of becoming such an absolute comedic failure. Im disappointed, hurt, and outright offended that my precious time has been wasted in my brain understanding that joke. In the time that took I was planning on helping kids who have been orphaned, but because of that you've wasted my time explaining the obscene integrity of your terrible attempt at comedy. Now those kids are suffering without meals and there's nobody to blame but you. I hope you're happy with what you have done and I truly hope you can move on and learn from this piss poor attempt.

2) There is a whole lot of items on this one scroll page. Might make loading really long or confusing to find ""just what I need"" on the site.

# FAQ
 
## What does this mean?
 
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
 
## Why did you do this?
 
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
 
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
 
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
 
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
 
## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
 
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
 
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
 
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right."
