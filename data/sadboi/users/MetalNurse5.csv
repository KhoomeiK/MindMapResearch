Guess what, I can't do injections and maintain a 6 foot distance! I cried while digging out scrubs packed away from a recent move in my carport that I haven't worn in 7 yrs because I have no access to proper PPE. I was never afraid of going into an isolation room while working as a CNA or in school. I've been exposed to it all but had the proper equipment to protect myself, not to mention immediate access to soap and water. Today I had the clothes I went to my office in and 2 sets of scrubs. I get to do it again in 2 days and I have to drive 45 minutes away from my office this time. My exposure risk is lower than my counterparts who work in the hospital but even with that, I work with the severely mentally ill, many older and with multiple other health conditions not to mention low income. I'm fucking terrified. And I make almost less than half of that 40 an hr. Yes, please pay me additional so I can go buy fucking hand sanitizer! Pay me more so that if I get sick I can still have a home! So that I can feed my children if I get sick and can't work!

I've only seen this work in favor of the pt one time. The info the pt provided to me surrounding at home readings vs what I was getting in the office on a monthly basis didn't match and allowed me to better educate the pt on the best time to take his bp med. One month later and his bp was much better controlled. This also plays up the importance of the Dr. educating the pt while in their office. I spent 2 yrs as a pharmacy tech and I can assure you that counseling doesn't necessarily happen there either! Some meds need to be taken in the am while others are better suited for pm use. Leads to better med compliance as well I think if unpleasant side effects can be avoided by taking the med properly, i.e. for the love of god if you are only taking lasix once daily, don't take it at bedtime!"

Using a hyaluronic serum as my base for moisturizing has helped tremendously and then building from there with the right facial oil. I generally avoid creams because they end up causing breakouts for me. Currently using The Ordinary's borage seed oil and I'm enjoying it. Hydrating the skin properly will make a world of difference before applying your makeup. I also avoid anything matte or for acne prone skin when it comes to foundation and powders. Way to drying and thats when I saw the flaking. If you really like the coverage of your current fountain, you could try adding a drop of facial oil in.
