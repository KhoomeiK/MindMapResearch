Parenting,fovoulk,t1_fovo0lz,1588104967.0,"It’s not funny when they tell me they want to poop in my mouth. That’s disgusting. Sure we joke about farts when we blame each other who did it, but it’s not funny when they think it’s funny to poop on each other or to poop in the shower and rub it on the walls."
Parenting,fovnmkw,t1_fovn2i1,1588104368.0,Yes we have had a conversation with their dad about it.. He has agreed to be careful with what they joke about at his house. It hasn’t really been working. He knows we try and nip that in the bud but he wants to be “the cool parent” and be more of a friend than a parent when he has them.  I’m hoping over time they will just realize he’s got an immature mentality and that stuff really isn’t funny.

And I would keep the remotes in my room unless they are using them. I had a tv growing up that only played tv so they could each watch what they wanted during the designated times. I obviously wouldn’t want them watching it in the middle of the night so it would be avoid."
lgbt,fmp5cwt,t1_fmof2yu,1586274733.0,It’s hard to do those things at an older age when you’ve been told not to for so long. Good for you for trying to step out of the box and make yourself happy!
lgbt,fmnzqcz,t3_fw6yy3,1586240287.0,Can’t wait to show my four year old son this. He loves “girly” things but is afraid of getting made fun of. When I show him it’s okay for boys to paint their nails using this picture hopefully he’ll understand it’s okay to be himself and we love him regardless.

venting,fluik3z,t3_fr8sjn,1585503307.0,Hard not to. Sometimes sharing makes you feel better but if it falls in the wrong hands it can be harmful instead of helpful. Sorry that happened to you but keep your head up.

glutenfree,fk2p4gw,t3_fg5keh,1583805928.0,"As a preschool teacher (and someone who has celiac) I’m honestly appalled that this happened at your kids school. I have lists everywhere with allergies of all kids. I understand mistakes happen, but it should only happen once. I wouldn’t be caught dead making a mistake like that more than one time. It doesn’t hurt to modify any craft or activity for a medical reason. A teacher should be accommodating everyone regardless. 
I hope things get better."
venting,fiw5sel,t3_fa5dwk,1582775885.0,I think you have every right to tell her how you feel slightly uncomfortable with her hanging out with those friends. Especially if she has made you ghost your friends in the past. It doesn’t matter how long she’s known them you are entitled to feel how you feel about the situation. If she doesn’t agree with it then that can depict how the relationship might go with other topics too

parentsofmultiples,fi5xsrm,t3_f6kglt,1582173098.0,"My twins are 4 yo and share a room and we LOVE our Hatch rest machine. We live in a place where the garage gets picked up at 6:45 am 3X a week and it would wake our kids up instantly. We bought the Hatch originally for the white noise option and we love that feature. 

My son also wakes up earlier than my daughter and he use to wake her up as soon as he got up. We got them into a routine where they cannot get out of bed in the morning until the light comes on the Hatch to tell them it’s time to get up. This way my daughter gets more rest but then they also know when he’s time to get up for school. I would recommend it 100% for I’ve seen great results with my kids."
parentsofmultiples,fi5dpeu,t1_fi572sm,1582160785.0,We do this too with our 4 yo B/G twins. Underwear is all in the same drawer. Daughter on the right and son on the left. Socks on the middle of one drawer with pjs split on the side of the socks in the middle. Everything else is hung up. Works great for us right now 😊

parentsofmultiples,fhusg3l,t3_f4rbxt,1581889705.0,Our B/G twins are 4 about to be 5. We are going to split them to right before they go to kindergarten. They are REALLY dependent on each other but nighttime has been a big issue lately. My son is a night owl and super early raiser whereas my daughter falls asleep within seconds and can sleep in for a very long time. He’s been keeping her up and waking her up so we thought we’d move them apart when they start kindergarten so sleep can be a focus before school. Good luck!
venting,fewc4hk,t3_eqr8r4,1579408210.0,"Coming from a position where my partner has kids, I can understand why he would like some room for discipline even if they aren’t his kids. I do feel like I should have some sort of say in what happens in my house even if the kids are not mine.

However,

If he wants to be in a position where he wants to discipline the kids then he needs to understand sacrificing for those kids too. That means that yes sometimes he may not get some sleep because of loud kids. That’s what happens when you come into a parent role. 

I agree with you points mentioned about staying out of trouble. They are having fun, connecting with each other, and not causing problems, so let the kids be kids. 

Good luck!"
lgbt,fen1pdv,t1_fem95q4,1579275005.0,I can absolutely see me doing this and it totally working! Thanks for the idea. I think the more they have to explain themselves the easier it is for them to understand how silly they sound caring what my child wears!
lgbt,fem2vq0,t1_fem0ivo,1579237950.0,"I appreciate your response. I think the approach you mentioned is a great idea. If they see we are okay with it then their words won’t mean anything. 
He has better style than me anyway so if I direct it that way I think it will work out. As long as he knows he’s loved I think it’ll be okay. I’m just sad people aren’t as open minded as they could be. 
Thank you again!"

Things were going well so she stopped going to therapy, which I didn’t agree with, but she did anyway. Part of the issue is she isn’t truthful with both therapists and doctors.

My kids they don’t act like that and I’m more than happy calling them out in the middle of a store for acting up then I am an employee doing their job.. people assume anything anymore and sometimes they are far from the truth. Others need to lighten up! If you discipline your kids enough you wouldn’t be as grumpy.
