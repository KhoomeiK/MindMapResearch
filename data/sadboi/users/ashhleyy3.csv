Sure we joke about farts when we blame each other who did it, but it‚Äôs not funny when they think it‚Äôs funny to poop on each other or to poop in the shower and rub it on the walls."
Parenting,fovnmkw,t1_fovn2i1,1588104368.0,Yes we have had a conversation with their dad about it.. He has agreed to be careful with what they joke about at his house. It hasn‚Äôt really been working. He knows we try and nip that in the bud but he wants to be ‚Äúthe cool parent‚Äù and be more of a friend than a parent when he has them.  I‚Äôm hoping over time they will just realize he‚Äôs got an immature mentality and that stuff really isn‚Äôt funny.

venting,fluik3z,t3_fr8sjn,1585503307.0,Hard not to. Sometimes sharing makes you feel better but if it falls in the wrong hands it can be harmful instead of helpful. Sorry that happened to you but keep your head up.

I have lists everywhere with allergies of all kids. I understand mistakes happen, but it should only happen once. I wouldn‚Äôt be caught dead making a mistake like that more than one time. It doesn‚Äôt hurt to modify any craft or activity for a medical reason. A teacher should be accommodating everyone regardless. 
I hope things get better."
venting,fiw5sel,t3_fa5dwk,1582775885.0,I think you have every right to tell her how you feel slightly uncomfortable with her hanging out with those friends. Especially if she has made you ghost your friends in the past. It doesn‚Äôt matter how long she‚Äôs known them you are entitled to feel how you feel about the situation. If she doesn‚Äôt agree with it then that can depict how the relationship might go with other topics too

parentsofmultiples,fi5xsrm,t3_f6kglt,1582173098.0,"My twins are 4 yo and share a room and we LOVE our Hatch rest machine. We live in a place where the garage gets picked up at 6:45 am 3X a week and it would wake our kids up instantly. We bought the Hatch originally for the white noise option and we love that feature. 

My son also wakes up earlier than my daughter and he use to wake her up as soon as he got up. We got them into a routine where they cannot get out of bed in the morning until the light comes on the Hatch to tell them it‚Äôs time to get up. This way my daughter gets more rest but then they also know when he‚Äôs time to get up for school. I would recommend it 100% for I‚Äôve seen great results with my kids."

parentsofmultiples,fhusg3l,t3_f4rbxt,1581889705.0,Our B/G twins are 4 about to be 5. We are going to split them to right before they go to kindergarten. They are REALLY dependent on each other but nighttime has been a big issue lately. My son is a night owl and super early raiser whereas my daughter falls asleep within seconds and can sleep in for a very long time. He‚Äôs been keeping her up and waking her up so we thought we‚Äôd move them apart when they start kindergarten so sleep can be a focus before school. Good luck!
venting,fewc4hk,t3_eqr8r4,1579408210.0,"Coming from a position where my partner has kids, I can understand why he would like some room for discipline even if they aren‚Äôt his kids. I do feel like I should have some sort of say in what happens in my house even if the kids are not mine.

However,

If he wants to be in a position where he wants to discipline the kids then he needs to understand sacrificing for those kids too. That means that yes sometimes he may not get some sleep because of loud kids. That‚Äôs what happens when you come into a parent role. 

I agree with you points mentioned about staying out of trouble. They are having fun, connecting with each other, and not causing problems, so let the kids be kids. 

Good luck!"

He has better style than me anyway so if I direct it that way I think it will work out. As long as he knows he‚Äôs loved I think it‚Äôll be okay. I‚Äôm just sad people aren‚Äôt as open minded as they could be.
