CanadaCoronavirus,fnzn6nt,t3_g4t8w8,1587397239.0,"I know that you have good intentions, but ""lifestyle"" issues are so multifaceted that there is very little way to legislate them away without severely infringing rights and/or having significant negative impacts. The reasons that people smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, and are overweight or otherwise unhealthy are complicated. What is an ""appropriate"" amount of alcohol that someone should be able to drink? How much exercise must someone do to qualify for a benefit? Who decides what is considered overweight? Why should a child be disadvantaged because of the environment they were raised in that led to their unhealthy lifestyle? The amount of money and resources (human and material) it would take to monitor these things, verify their accuracy, and then distribute benefits and/or penalties would likely be much higher than any societal benefit we would see. 

Plus, we do have many carrots and sticks in place already (both intentional and not). We limit the ways in which people can use tobacco, alcohol, and other substances that are known to cause harm. We focus on educating people about the ways in which these things cause harm, and provide free and/or subsidized programs to help people change their habits. 

When it comes down to it, it is not a governments role to dictate your every decision, and I would not want to live in a place where it is. Instead, we focus on making opportunities available for those who want to and are ready to make changes. I agree that there is room for improvement - tobacco replacement therapies should be free, access to rehab should be increased, access to healthy food should be improved, there should be more physical activity in school, and mental health services should be accessible and free. But everything comes at a cost. And not just a literal monetary cost, but an opportunity cost.

I saw a pelvic floor PT (for non pregnancy related pelvic floor tightness) and the PT told me that its really common for women to have tight but weak pelvic floors. She said most women do not need to do a ton of kegels, but instead recommended doing reverse kegels. Doing these should be a good indicator of whether your pelvic floor is tight or not. If you start lying down on your back with your knees bent (this is the easiest position to control your PF) try to do a gentle kegel, and then let it go. Imagine your pelvic floor like a trampoline, where a kegel is pulling it upwards toward your belly button, and releasing it is pushing it down to your feet. If its hard to release it, thats a sign that your PF is tight. You can use your breath and visualization to try to encourage the release. Once you are able to do it in the lying down position, you can progress to trying other positions. You should notice that as it gets easier to release it, your kegels become more distinct. 

I hope that makes sense!"

So sure, I‚Äôm not officially anemic, but that‚Äôs not ideal either. 

Unfortunately, I think the main value comes from the fact that naturopaths spend so much time with you and are able to get to know all aspects of your health versus a rushed 10-15 minutes focusing on a specific issue. 

Definitely a good idea to do your research and find out what kind of naturopath - are they totally anti allopathic medicine? Are they anti-vax or anti-medication?

Tip 1: use salicylic acid on your pits every day before putting deo on. I use stridex pads. The salicylic acid exfoliates and helps kill bacteria on your skin which can cause you to smell. Sometimes just doing this is enough to stop the smells 

Tip 2: using a mask on your pits. Every once in awhile I do a mask with Aztec healing clay on my pits and it helps my natural odor be way less offensive."

Sometimes I wish people cared more about what others thought of them and maybe just felt a bit more shame. In this case, maybe a lot more shame. I feel bad for their kids..."

As a 30 year old, there is no way in hell. But all my jeans are tight so there's no way that would be comfy. I do feel like jeans are probably pretty good at regulating temperature though!"

hsp,fjnsv4r,t3_fe67y8,1583513797.0,"I can definitely relate to this! I‚Äôve bounced around jobs a lot, and have been unhappy in all of them for one reason or another. I think because even small emotions can feel so overwhelming for me, a minor negative aspect of a job can totally overtake all of the positives. One thing that has helped me is keeping a list of all the benefits of my job and referring to it often. For example, in my current job I have a ton of flexibility, can work from home, am not micromanaged, don‚Äôt really have a dress code, and don‚Äôt have to attend a lot of meetings. Focusing on these things makes me realize that the fact that I have a very difficult time communicating with my boss, which can sometimes be so overwhelmingly frustrating, is just one part. No job is going to be perfect on all fronts. Letting go of perfectionism is easier said than done though! It‚Äôs a practice, for sure. 

The other thing I‚Äôve really noticed is that I take on the responsibility of managing other people‚Äôs emotions and reactions, which at best is exhausting and at worst is codependent and can become abusive.  I can‚Äôt do anything about the fact that my boss is an emotional robot. What I can do is not let that dictate how I communicate with her. I think as hsp‚Äôs we can hold ourselves to a very high moral and ethical standard, especially when it comes to processing other people‚Äôs emotions, and it doesn‚Äôt feel good when other people don‚Äôt do the same. Similar to my earlier point, I remind myself regularly that it is not my job to try to figure other people out all the time. If my boss has an issue with my work, it is literally her job to tell me that, so why waste my valuable energy trying to decipher her passive aggressiveness and lack of direction? If I‚Äôm picking up that someone is annoyed, maybe it has nothing to do with me and instead they‚Äôre just having a shitty day, or have something very difficult going on in their life. Again, I remind myself often that I can only be responsible for myself. 

Stay strong! The workplace needs more hsps!"

hsp,fj7ut9m,t3_fbycj0,1583098773.0,I find journaling helpful! Or even just speaking out loud to yourself. Writing ‚Äú I‚Äôm angry about....‚Äù followed by ‚Äúand that‚Äôs ok ‚Äú or ‚Äúand it will pass‚Äù. It feels very cathartic and helps recognizing and validating your feelings
PMDD,fj5chrp,t3_fbi1se,1583029418.0,"One exercise I‚Äôve found helpful is to write out the thoughts I‚Äôm having followed by ‚Äúand that‚Äôs okay‚Äù. And saying them out loud too. 

So I‚Äôll literally write out: today, I hate myself. And that‚Äôs ok. I feel like no one likes me, and that‚Äôs ok, etc. 

It seems silly, but it has a weird effect. I‚Äôve talked to my therapist about it and I can‚Äôt remember exactly how she described it but she basically said when you have these intrusive thoughts and a part of your brain is trying to reject them because they feel irrational or untrue, all it does it make you think it over and over and over. If you think and say, it‚Äôs ok that I‚Äôm having this specific thought, it‚Äôs a way of addressing it as a thought, not necessarily something that is true. I‚Äôve found it so helpful particularly in dealing with the guilt I often feel as a result of intrusive thoughts."
