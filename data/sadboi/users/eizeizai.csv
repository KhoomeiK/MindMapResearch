Always get partnered up with MM mains so i end up playing Martis (which is a hero im not an expert at). Im not pretty good at ML but damn my teammates in rank are the worst.

AskReddit,fbunw59,t3_eeczow,1577117549.0,"That I was molested when I was a kid. I live in the Philippines and we used to go to Batangas, my mom's hometown. We would stay there in summer I think and I would stay over at my cousin's house (I think she is my cousin, my mom's side has a very big family tree).

 I was a child at the time, maybe 7-10 not sure. My vagina used to hurt whenever I peed, sometimes and her father (i think it was her father but im not sure because they looked quite old) would ask to check my vagina. I'm not really quite comfortable with revealing the details but this unknowingly traumatised me growing up. I noticed that this event was one of the reasons I was always defensive and always had my walls up around older men (besides my trusted relatives) and I would sometimes become rude towards them. 

I've only told this to my best friend and I don't feel comfortable telling this to my family. It's not like telling them would make everything better and I dont really confide in them that much. I'm now 15 and want to forget and move on from that event as soon as possible and try to become a much better person."
