Dadylions and maregolds go crazy! Throw some bird seed in there too. 10 years I’ve had this uro and never fed a bug. Kept her lean and is definitely not fed daily. So they can take some neglect when times get busy. Get it hot on a stable rock pile, keep it dry (easy in almost any central heating home). And get a open sandwich Tupperware and place it on the far end of the cage with some slate leading to it. As the uro poops put them in the lidless Tupperware with a layer of paper towel down. Eventually most lizard can be “potty trained” where generally they like to poo away from their basking and feeding areas and usually in the same spot.

Now all my thermostats are mounted on the sides of the cage stack, but also switched to over head heat emitters. Also the cats hug the cages when the elements are on full steam during the day.

Fertility testing is some high stakes and high anxiety results for people struggling to create a family.

EverythingScience,flzmze1,t1_flw5s4v,1585627735.0,"I prefer PCR over molecular. Our system pit a number of vendors against each other for flu testing in point of care and flu testing in lab. The menu of test options on cephied without needing to get another device is a huge value in space deprived lab testing spaces. Just about every major system has a cephied instrument and they are very straight forward to validate with strong vendor support. Many Abbott products have limited menus and configurations, meaning you often end up needing multiple instruments to manage patient care.

Plus I am reluctant about any sort of point of care device when it’s a critical result. I’ve managed point of care programs and they are rife with compliance issues. The ID now is a great device for triage, but EXPENSIVE, which is true for all point of care. So Abbott going to be awesome for the drive through testing and as hospitals specialize to become respiratory issues only locations and divert non respiratory conditions to other hospitals. But when the wave dies down I expect to see a lot of doc offices with these devices, probably won’t have a CLIA license, and no clue why competency matters for patient care; that will not want to give up the on site testing. I see a lot of labs having to hunt down rogue offices and confiscate them or risk deficiencies with the in house lab testing.

It’s neat to see how quickly the medical community can mobilize when the barriers for innovation are down. but as a lab person who audits, 2022 is going to be an experience to audit any multi clinic clients."
