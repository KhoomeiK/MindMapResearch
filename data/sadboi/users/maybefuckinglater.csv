morbidquestions,fqwon2z,t3_gl5i0c,1589712215.0,"Hmm,

So this one time after I took a shower my heart started beating. I couldnâ€™t sleep and I felt like pacing. My anxiety was through the roof. Then I couldnâ€™t stop crying. I kept hearing voices telling me I was worthless and to kill myself. It was the first time I ever hallucinated. I started to believe the voices. So I had to plan my death. It was really hard trying to sleep that night.

Thatâ€™s just auditory hallucinations. Iâ€™m bipolar, so I havenâ€™t really talked about feelings of grandiosity yet or mania. Those moments I literally feel like a god. I start speaking faster. My ideas are coming out of everywhere. I feel like I can be the next bill gates. I donâ€™t really make sense to people. Then when I say Iâ€™m getting a bunch of ideas most of them arenâ€™t safe at all. Last time I decided I was going to be homeless and live off the land because I didnâ€™t want to be a burden to anyone.

My advice is to think about could you have any other mental problems and see if any other medication will work better for you that you will feel more comfortable with. I canâ€™t say I stopped having these thoughts but I believe it has made a change getting switched to a better medicine. Also maybe a therapist can work too if you need to vent."
