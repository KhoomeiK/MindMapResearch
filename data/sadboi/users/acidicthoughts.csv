BipolarReddit,f9fhhl5,t3_e46j0g,1575272000.0,I’m sorry you have to go through this. Being misunderstood is one of the worst feelings ever. you can vent on here...most of us can understand some things.
BipolarReddit,f9fhf4b,t3_e4shle,1575271914.0,we all want to be loved. why don’t you trust yourself?
BipolarReddit,f9emceq,t3_e4hrrm,1575246464.0,"wow, he sounds great. thank you for sharing it’s a question i always come back to. I hope he can be what you need...especially during the tough times."
BipolarReddit,f994fgz,t1_f97tz4r,1575186908.0,yeah that’s definitely racing thoughts. you can’t keep up with it and it’s so loud. it’s like your brain is moving so fast you’re trying to catch it?
BipolarReddit,f97e4po,t1_f96xbwd,1575164314.0,thanks. I am doing ok. I take seroquel now and it helps with sleeping so much. I see a therapist weekly and have a good support system especially during crisis. how are you doing?
BipolarReddit,f96whf2,t3_e3wqoy,1575153680.0,"I had the worst experience with all of the SSRIs. i tried every single one. prozac, celexa, lexapro, zoloft, ecitalopram, etc. and they either did not work at all or they triggered episodes or increased my suicidal thoughts/actions. When i was seen by a group of psych residents and told them this, they immediately wanted to diagnose me with bipolar (before i was diagnosed) based purely on the fact that the SSRIs did this to me. pretty wild"
BipolarReddit,f96w7p7,t3_e41e6n,1575153500.0,"hi, also have ptsd as well as bipolar. driving is the hardest time for me when i get ptsd flare ups. it’s a simple task that we do every day and an easy time for our minds to slip out of the present. you are not alone in this at all. I’ve almost gotten in accidents and ran red lights, etc. totally valid to be terrified because it is dangerous. have you ever tried any grounding exercises?"
BipolarReddit,f96vzjl,t3_e3zlwz,1575153348.0,sounds like your personal jukebox needs some new tunes? listen to jungle by tash sultana
BipolarReddit,f96vsuu,t3_e3skz3,1575153222.0,"wow. thank you for sharing, this is super encouraging to hear about good educated people who are willing and so able to help people."
BipolarReddit,f96oqx5,t3_e3w3ue,1575149004.0,when you say mental noise do you mean racing thoughts? i think it’s normal to have your mind constantly thinking and associating. sometimes in mania I get loud racing thoughts. I will sometimes just cover my ears with my hands and close my eyes and it helps sometimes. sometimes there is nothing you can do but endure it...I’m sorry you have to go through it.
BipolarReddit,f94sn4s,t1_f94k6qx,1575101389.0,hahaha I love it !!! I always want to climb trees in the middle of the night! I love climbing trees in general though :)
BipolarReddit,f94ck18,t1_f93ft1f,1575084014.0,"wow !!! I am shocked that you had a good experience with the police. in my experience, the police aren’t necessarily educated enough to know exactly what to do or say. I think it is a mix for sure, me stigmatizing myself and others. Thank you for sharing :)"
BipolarReddit,f94canr,t1_f92zser,1575083783.0,"thank you for sharing :) you gave me new perspective and inspired me. I actually did a rotation in school
in the psych unit that I was actually in as a patient a year prior to being a student there. I did just exactly that: spent hours listening and hearing people’s stories. it was a beautiful and healing thing for me. that’s all we’re really seeking is to be seen and heard. it’s such a simple and important gift we can give people."
BipolarReddit,f94bzky,t1_f93w916,1575083509.0,would love to hear more :)
BipolarReddit,f928n1h,t3_e36eqq,1575017944.0,self diagnosing is dangerous. I hope you have someone to help you through the process of a possible diagnosis
BipolarReddit,f928kho,t3_e2y75q,1575017839.0,thankful for people who can be a safe place for me when I need extra help. thankful for access to a therapist who knows me and a psychiatrist who helps me as well. what’re you thankful for?
BipolarReddit,f92804p,t3_e36ftw,1575017000.0,"thank you for sharing. this sounds like mania to me. something that helps me is to know that each episode can be different and that is ok. you sound very self aware and like you know yourself, even if you are asking who you are. I think you might know more of your “self” than you realize."
BipolarReddit,f927v7u,t3_e35r3s,1575016796.0,thank you for your honesty. I respect you so much for honoring how you feel and I am so sorry. Your existence is valid and I hope the fog gets lifted soon
BipolarReddit,f927p99,t3_e31uj8,1575016556.0,"ugh !! this is so ridiculous... it just clearly shows how people (even your family don’t understand anything about mental illness, especially bipolar). meds DO NOT make you have unipolar happiness!! this makes me so mad. in fact, most meds have their own list of side effects that we have to subject ourselves to...they don’t fix everything and they are hard to take most of the time. I’m glad you advocated for yourself because yes, you are allowed to have different moods at any time because you are human. gosh I feel the frustration!"
BipolarReddit,f8odgz1,t3_dzktro,1574674917.0,"medicine scared me before I started. it felt like such a huge decision, and I wanted it to be something I decided on my own. without the pressure of anyone who loves me. deciding to subject myself to medication titled “antipsychotics” was enough to scare me alone. something that helped me was telling myself that it is worth a try if you are willing to. my therapist encouraged me to be a “good scientist” and take it for at least 6 months...thinking that would be long enough to see it effect me in different seasons. I have been on it for almost a year now and it is much less scary now that I know I am still me."
BipolarReddit,f8oda38,t3_dzqd74,1574674608.0,thank you for sharing I really felt connected to this
BipolarReddit,f8od1sp,t3_dykgu2,1574674231.0,I agree completely. I think there are people out there who don’t know how to respond to mental illness in general. people say stupid and unrealistic cliches because they don’t know what else to say and it can be really invalidating and frustrating
BipolarReddit,f8ocu07,t3_e1biox,1574673879.0,"i think it’s important to know that whatever you are feeling is ok no matter if it’s a part of an episode or not. I went through some similar feelings...judging if it was manic or depressive and the most helpful thing I have learned is not to judge the feeling and its nature, but to accept and honor it no matter what it may be indicating."
BipolarReddit,f8ocqjo,t3_e19o79,1574673724.0,I hear you. and all of what you said is valid. there are people who don’t deserve to be in our inner circles. we learn to trust the ones who have earned our trust and respect our boundaries. it is ok to not be ok
bipolar,f8o0q3y,t3_e11rik,1574658512.0,"this same thing happened to me after a painful break up, my family and I went to hawaii. I thought hawaii would heal me, maybe even change me. but a beautiful place doesn’t change our states of ascending and descending. we don’t get to decide unfortunately. I know this feeling, and I think the best thing you can do is to accept and honor your feelings
no matter where they live (in depression or not). having expectations for yourself on vacation is very normal and really hard to reach."
bipolar,f8o0g23,t3_e17h0z,1574658248.0,"it is difficult accepting, and it’s strong. you are powerful and you are seeking help, and that is important to be closer to healing. sleeping is really difficult for me too...lying alone with your head and in silence especially. try to remember that even the smallest feats are important and deserve recognition. asking for help is so strong"
bipolar,f8nrq7i,t1_f8fgq40,1574651240.0,thank you !! sounds cool
bipolar,f8dm270,t1_f8dbyat,1574497748.0,thank you !! i will check it out
bipolar,f8d6d3b,t3_dzt17d,1574479626.0,"both are difficult things to hold onto. i think emptiness and lack of any feelings is worse for me. I start to feel like a robot after a while...invalid and unworthy of being a human with feelings, etc etc etc"
bipolar,f8d64w2,t3_dzxsht,1574479425.0,the painful truth is that people can’t understand suicidal ideation until they have felt it. people love to say it is selfish and simplify the concept as if it can be simple. you are not alone and the best thing someone told me with my SI was that it is ok to feel it. and it is ok to have the desires...you are not “bad” for harboring these feelings. your feelings are completely valid and I hear you
bipolar,f8d5jsg,t3_dzk8lt,1574478915.0,This must be the place (naive melody) David Byrne :)
bipolar,f8awle9,t3_dzhkil,1574415838.0,it’s ok to feel whatever you are feeling right now. lean on the people you have and allow them to hold you. a hurting heart is full of love
bipolar,f8awgzz,t3_dzwe7c,1574415643.0,"birds have so much meaning for me. something about wings evokes such freedom. a value I’m almost always reaching for. we may never reach full freedom, but we can feel “free” and that is enough sometimes."
bipolar,f8aw4df,t3_dzhx10,1574415092.0,"thank you for sharing, one of the kindest things I can do for myself here in a low is honor the feelings I am having. i think we so often fight with the lows because these feelings are characterized by society as “bad”. when in reality, whatever we feel is ok. our feelings are our truth, even if we don’t feel like we are our “self”. what is the self?"
BipolarReddit,f7x6mtz,t3_dxthpa,1574047716.0,“crazy” is such an arbitrary word. people use and abuse it all the time. I purposely stopped using the word for anything because of the hurtful and imprecise nature. having mental illness does not mean one is “crazy”. needing help in this realm is ok.
BipolarReddit,f7x67qg,t3_dxp3lc,1574047385.0,I can relate to this on a deep level. just never heard it articulated so well. withdrawals from this class of medication are much more intense than almost any other in my opinion. I hope you can get some soon and be helped
BipolarReddit,f6bbx8n,t3_bptdyy,1572771621.0,"I think this post is important. it can be invalidating in any mental illness realm when language around the symptoms is so arbitrary. I also think it is important to note that yes, the DSM has strict criteria for an official diagnosis of mania/bipolar (and self diagnosing isn’t any more validating either) AND every human is completely individualized. so much so that each and every person living with bipolar will experience their swings so differently. it is not our job to tell people what is and isn’t real to them...we can only hope that they will do their research and use clear language around their person’s experiences."

NoStupidQuestions,f1g6fpi,t3_d9ce2k,1569460920.0,I try using voice texting on the notes app. it’s not always accurate but if you’re sleepy and don’t want to open your eyes and fully wake up you can open notes and use this to say what your dream is. worth a shot

NoStupidQuestions,f1dtow4,t3_d8pkci,1569399014.0,"yes !!!!!!! thank you. if only perfume didn’t exist, gross"
bipolar,f1dtdsy,t3_d8zytl,1569398574.0,thank you for sharing. do you have a safe person? and have you shared this with them? the most important thing you can do sometimes is tell someone. someone safe and who you trust. all of your feelings are so valid. feeling afraid is completely valid and ok. you are ok and you are allowed to feel what you do. only you really know how much you need help. trust yourself to nudge you forward to whatever it is you need.
BipolarReddit,f1drhzj,t3_d8vbem,1569396061.0,"of course. I tell people I see them hoping someone will see me too. giving others what i hope to some day be given is all I can do. it’s truly terrifying to feel like we have to hide our mental illnesses from the world we live in. we have such a long way to go here on this planet...yes mental health/illness has become more present and important in our society. but not even close to where we ought to be. I’m truly ashamed of this world and the shame they bring to people who need help and DESERVE the right to be present in a space where everyone else gets to be. we shouldn’t have to earn the power to be. we are an army of hurting/learning humans and we have a fucking voice !!! 

screaming from the U.S."
BipolarReddit,f1dj99u,t1_f1cxo5n,1569386090.0,"wow, go you for seeking work elsewhere. you don’t ever deserve to be treated differently than anyone else. you have rights and power all within you. they don’t deserve to have you on their team!!"
BipolarReddit,f1dj2tx,t3_d8vbem,1569385909.0,"wow, this is absolutely ridiculous. I cannot believe the level of ignorance within every part of this story. how ironic inside of a psychology world that STUDIES this very thing. do they believe anyone with bipolar/mental illness is a threat to the public? and you didn’t do anything wrong. you sought out confidential validation and help in that colleague “turns” you in. I am so sorry and have so much compassion for you. it’s like we are treated like criminals or animals. and people wonder why we don’t share or speak up about these issues. 

Privacy is something I value and hold so tight to. I didn’t know they could access your records so easily? what about HIPPA? this sounds wrong and illegal. you should be protected from this. I am a nurse and when accessing mental health records in the psychiatric units at the hospital, there is a lock on every patient’s chart. unless you are on their treatment team, you have to “break the glass” in order to access their information. the hospital watches closely to see if anyone is unnecessarily looking in a psychiatric patient’s chart. I am very curious to know how they have this power over you? 

Once again, i am so sorry. I wish you would seek work elsewhere with people who support you and care for you. it’s not worth being punished. you are human and you have rights. you have power in your diagnosis. I see you. I hope you find peace and freedom."

BipolarReddit,f0941b1,t1_f07grtm,1568493547.0,thank you for sharing. it’s like “normalcy” is so fucking boring. i can’t handle being in that space without feeling outside of myself. i dream of existing in a world where my illness is accepted and I am free.
BipolarReddit,f05vz0w,t1_f05tyl9,1568421336.0,yes I completely agree. i walk around and look at people i pass by and feel so disconnected from them. i feel like i’m an outsider and people know that when they’re in my presence / when they feel my energy.

lateralus for me is a pulling toward and away from the spiral. an experience with both swinging on the spiral and spiraling out simultaneously -and “still be human” is to reach another level of spirituality.
parabola then inviting us to hold on, stay inside. to be held by our own bodies, licking our wounds...reminding ourselves pain is an illusion. reaching a higher space again that seems impossible to touch here on earth."
