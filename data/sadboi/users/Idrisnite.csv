ASPDwomen,fqqzzou,t1_fqqvy47,1589575055.0,"I still take Mirtazapine, so it definitely lightened. Pretty sure I'm mostly just ""pandemic suffering"" like everyone else now. Dopamine chasing is my biggest hurdle currently. I just don't turn to drugs anymore.
Yeah loss of control is fucking terrible, especially with ASPD since many ppl with it, navigate their lives by controlling others at least to an extent. And having trouble foreseeing consequences is also a big ASPD symptom, something I have too. Even when I know the consequences, I can just not worry/care about it. Sometimes you just gotta get hit with them enough times to learn from it I guess. 
But don't believe that you need to continue working the lie that you feel forced to live. There are other solutions, you just haven't found them yet. Stay open-minded and actively solve the puzzle that is your life. Journal about it if you have to. Therapy definitely helps but it's a shame that most people can't go to IRL therapy sessions, me included. Fuck this stupid pandemic."
ASPDwomen,fqqgihk,t3_gkb0fv,1589565122.0,"Yeah I can relate to this. I've been on zoloft too, it didn't do much for me after 2 months so I dropped it without consequences too. Now I'm on Mirtazapine mostly for depression and stabilizing insomnia. I believe you can definitely have depression and ASPD. I believe I might have ASPD too and my depression is diagnosed. Depression definitely came from extreme boredom/frustration and feeling trapped in life due to certain new circumstances I was in (moving back to my home country).  


Without Mirtazapine, I was extremely visibly  irritated by family/""friends"" who insisted on having conversations with me and including me in their lives assuming I cared about them. I didn't have much to do so I was terribly moody.  


The Mirtazapine made me more calm, patient and tolerant of my surroundings. It helped me find ways to lessen the boredom through healthier means (unlike drugs and sex). But one thing stayed constant: I don't give a shit about anyone or what they have to say. I think that is something specific to ASPD. 

It's certainly possible to have depression come from situations that have nothing to do with someone emotionally hurting you / breaking your heart / abandoning you. If you don't like where your life is heading and you're not sure how to fix it, you will be more prone to depression regardless of having ASPD."

changemyview,fp0w8nw,t3_gaicru,1588218336.0,"I've heard a gender fluid acquaintance at a past job I worked at once describe gender fluidity like this: he feels completely trans some days, sometimes lasting weeks or longer than a month, and some days he feels cisgender again. He at first thought he couldn't make up his mind, thought he was crazy but eventually he realized his mind just shifted on its own periodically. He never felt comfortable dressing like a woman when he ""felt female"" because his physical body was clearly male and he knew how crazy it would look if he didn't ""stick to presenting as a transgender woman"". So he did small things like let his hair loose, wear ""girly"" jewelry, shave his face bare, slightly tighter clothes, just to feel more like his female self when the feeling hit him. But he still never urged anyone in his life to refer to him as ""she"" during those phases because it's too confusing for people to keep up. This changed my perspective on gender fluidity. It can happen to someone and it's out of their control. Gender expression is based on what feels comfortable for the person. That doesn't have to be stereotypical stuff but often is because let's face it. MOST women prefer feminine looking things. And vice versa. It's not sexist to say that."

ASPDwomen,fok8lam,t3_g7x081,1587837421.0,"I've walked in the streets at night, sometimes until morning, countless times in my life, in the apparent dangerous areas of my country. There were times where I was followed, cat called, and approached by men, homeless ones too. I also took rides from strangers many times.  I've even fallen asleep in bushes when I was a teen.  I never felt particularly scared in those situations. I imagine that fear feels like rapid heart beat and panic about worst case scenarios. I never had that physiological reaction. But I knew I was taking risks and was alert and aware of my surroundings .I did imagine worst case scenarios to figure out what I'd do to get myself out of them. I made plans and tried to prepare myself emotionally. I made sure to notice people and their intentions before they noticed me and tried to ""act tough"" when I needed to.

I went to Venezuela on a business trip with my mom 7 years ago, I was 16 at the time and things went south and we had to travel through a very dangerous neighborhood by foot to get to our destination before it got too dark. It was getting dark. We saw dead bodies on the streets we were walking on. My heart rate was normal. I realized it was my first time seeing dead bodies in real life outside of a funeral setting but I was matter-of-fact about it. Took it as a sign that gun owners were around so I was extra alert. Tried to keep my mom calm, she was in full panic mode. The only thing on my mind was getting to where we needed to go. Once we were safe, I was relieved but still not in disbelief or shock or anything. I thought I'd feel more adrenaline from that.

edit: i did feel extremely annoyed at my mom for freaking out because I felt like that put us at more risk if the wrong people saw us. I told her to shut up multiple times."
