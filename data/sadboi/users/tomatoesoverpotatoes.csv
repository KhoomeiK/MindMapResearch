socialism,fj6scv2,t3_fb1jkw,1583079115.0,"I have a question - 

When they say ALL period products, this includes tampons and sanitary napkins that are provided by large conglomerates like P&G. If they were to become free, the government would bear the entire cost of these products. Is that fiscally sensible? 

As a woman, I'm naturally 100% supportive of access to free period products and believe that it is an absolute necessity. But would it not make sense instead for the government to find, let's say one brand or one manufacturer and have them produce free products at a fraction of the cost for the govt to bear, and then supply that for free instead?

The point is not just access, it is also challenging the monopoly and power that these large enterprises in the field of sanitation hold. Now instead of people picking up that tab, the Government will. 

Wouldn't it make more sense for the govt to provide and alternative free brand (that is not controlled by profit mongers) that enters the market and poses as a competitor to free reigning conglomerates while also simultaneously providing women with the option to choose? 

Of course the quality needs to be of a certain level and there need to be strict norms followed, but wouldn't that be a more doable idea? 

Perhaps I have this bill wrong, but I think while also encouraging women to get what they deserve for free, we need to prevent companies profiting off of this - something that the bill seemingly won't do."

I mean, if he was giving up actual responsibilities, which he is in terms of building relationships and PR, but I mean more like responsibilities to the state, it would be problematic. 

He's trying to dissociate from a body that has quite frankly become obsolete and take on financial responsibility and not be dependent on the crown's money. 

It was bound to happen at some point. I'm surprised it took this long."

india,fag2oy1,t3_e8tyev,1576038416.0,"Apparently a US commission is seeking sanctions against Amit Shah for the passing of the CAB (LOL when did US become the patron saint of inclusion? Remember the outright Muslim ban there?) 
Anyway, these sanctions are currently imposed on other authoritarian figures like DPRK's Kim and Putin in Russia. At the very least, people all over the world are aware of what is happening. And they know it is vile, and exclusionary. 

But more than their support, we need the support of our fellow brethren. All of us who are 'apolitical' and do not want to engage in the larger debate - we need to show them that is is only the beginning. 

I ask myself sometimes, how did people let the Holocaust happen? Did people not see the evil? Did they not rise against fascism? And now, decades later  - I see how. I see how irrationality becomes part of rational justification. I see the normalization of ostracization. I see how they've slowly created an Us Vs Them leading to the othering of an entire community. This is how it happens. It spreads it roots slowly, indoctrinating minds, exposing people to propaanda. And before you know it, you become part of the wave. 

What are we becoming?"

I am sorry that all you feel is darkness right now. I wish I could pull you out of it. I just want you to ask yourself one question - 

What do you need right now? 

It doesn't have to be a deep answer. Just a very simple thing. What do you need? What do you need to feel better? Not the illusion of feeling better - actually feeling better. 

Tell me, what do you need? 

And if you feel like you can't figure it out right now, we'll work through the thoughts together."

Thanks a bunch :) 

Just a quick follow up - is there anyway I can make all the unique IDs the same size? 

Rn it's 1711, 1712,.....171123

Is there anyway to insert 0s before the digits to equalize the size? I tried the trick that some of the others mentioned - 04.0f - but it keeps telling me that the option is not allowed"
stata,f6sac0n,t1_f6s9d3f,1573130451.0,"Okay, so what I have as town_id are 3 digit numbers. Eg. 171, 172
Multiple observations have the same town id. 

When I tried creating a unique Id using the code you asked me to try, my unique Id was just a replication of the town_id variable, only in string format. 

I tried it another way where I did 

gen unique_id = string(town_id) + string(_n) 

So I defn have unique IDs, but there's no numeric consistency. 

How do I design it such that, let's say the 6 observations corresponding to town_id 171 would be 171001, 171002, ...171006 
And then the ones with town_id 172 would begin again from 1?
