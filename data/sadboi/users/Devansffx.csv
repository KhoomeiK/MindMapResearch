I offer to him all my wants, desires, lusts etc, into his control. I can trust he will take care of me. He will tease and do some denial but when he's heard enough of my begging, he is accommodating.

As for keeping the peace, F THAT!! If that was so important they would have invested in him when he was younger. Never value ""peace"" in the family at the expense of the mental health of someone you claim to love.

It might help to identify what those needs are. Is there a way for those needs to be met in your monogamous relationship? If not, what are your options? Polyamory has worked for a lot of people. But it isn't for everyone. With good communication (needed for all relationships, really) you might find something that's works that is outside that mono paradigm we grow up with.

She expressed the desire to stay with you so that is a starting point. Don't put her in a position to like to you. Assume she will do it again if things don't change. What next?"
