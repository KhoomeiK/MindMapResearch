sonos,fpw5qwb,t3_gfta1h,1588957728.0,"+1 on the idea of buying used Sonos speakers if you want to make a 5.1 system or whatever. It's a brand that a lot of people like to make upgrades with (meaning they'll sell off their initial purchases), and because it just sits there and isn't handled or anything on a daily basis it's usually in like-new condition even when used. So I bought a Beam brand-new (they had just come out so you couldn't find them used) but then found two Play:1s used on CL for the surround sound. Also got a third used Play:1 for my bedroom. I later upgraded that one to a new Sonos One so I could use Airplay from my phone with it, and guess what I did? Sold the Play:1 to someone else."

AskVegans,fgrdk5c,t1_fgrcb2m,1581044191.0,">Also, meat is the common culprit for pet food recallsâ€¦Regular cat food can just as easily make your cat sick.

But I'm not talking about a one-off event of contaminated meat that might give make my cats sick. Obviously any commercially made food is subject to occasional issues â€“ in the US we've seen recalls of spinach and romaine lettuce due to E. coli contamination from a particular processor. (And I do feed them one of the higher-quality brands, not just Purina crap from the supermarket.) I'm talking about the long-term effects of feeding a non-meat diet to an obligate carnivore and how that can affect them.  

And the only vegan cat food options I've seen are two brands that are made and sold in the UK and the EU, respectively. I don't know if they'd ship to the US and even if they did, I think it would be way too expensive for me to feed two cats on expensive imported food. 

Also, my cats are on a prescription food anyway, which isn't available in those two vegan brands. So, it's back to the meat for them."
AskVegans,fgqtdo0,t3_ezz7md,1581031082.0,"I feed my cats wet food because being vegan is a choice I can make for myself, but my cats don't get to make a choice about their diet, and I know they need to have meat for their health.

So basically I've just accepted that that's the only meat I will ever buy and I'm doing it to make sure that the creatures in my care live a healthy life, so I don't really think about it anymore (except to feel slightly grossed out when I get meat juice on my hands and have to go wash up)."
