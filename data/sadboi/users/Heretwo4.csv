X4Foundations,foiv8r6,t3_g7mt27,1587798148.0,Yes please! Also wondering this.
X4Foundations,focb7b2,t3_g6pc00,1587669261.0,"What an excellent idea! Is this mod available somewhere for people to track or be notified on release? 

Would it be so hard to have a notification config menu to let us minimize or maximize the amount of news coverage we want? That way you can go all out and let the user parse out the noise as they wish. At least in X3 modded config menus were relatively painless to program. 

Regardless, looking forward to this mod coming out."
