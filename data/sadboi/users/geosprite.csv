muacjdiscussion,fquzf4v,t3_gkh174,1589666896.0,Fenty Gloss Bomb in the original color. Idk why but I love gloss and I was out
AmItheAsshole,fq07zhg,t3_gg6z20,1589028621.0,NTA - he wants to fuck you and he was being creepy. He’ll most likely hit you up again for some awkward conversation after he puts a lot of thought into it
piercing,fp4kpvd,t3_g4clnf,1588301182.0,Double on the same side!
piercing,fp4j2dw,t3_gax6dr,1588300143.0,Love it!
PiercingAdvice,fp11vyw,t3_g76zlg,1588222190.0,"I had three nostril piercings at one point (two on one side and one on the other side). I honestly knew a piercer who had three on each side so 6 in total. I think it depends on the nose, for myself I’d like to keep it at two piercings. I’m also not factoring a septum in"
piercing,fnvvx1j,t1_fns97za,1587306023.0,Thank you!
piercing,fnq81v1,t1_fnpg6ua,1587159468.0,Do it. It’s super fun. One on each side is cool too
piercing,fnq80kq,t1_fnpwtul,1587159449.0,That’s true lol
piercing,fnq7zg9,t1_fnq6y1u,1587159432.0,Mucho gracias
piercing,fnq7yjd,t1_fnq3xcy,1587159418.0,Thank you!
piercing,fnpsn41,t1_fnpf3em,1587151261.0,Yea the higher one I’ve had forever basically ahah. So it stays but I just wasn’t sure because I see so many that are straight across but if it doesn’t look odd that makes me feel better tbh
piercing,fnpsj3j,t1_fnpg6ua,1587151202.0,Thank you! I might be overly critical of it tbh
piercing,fnpshk3,t1_fnpmp12,1587151180.0,I’ve thought too that it was unique. Honestly it looks different with every type of jewelery- when I wear a hoop in the back they look even
piercing,fnpeixb,t1_fnpe7nt,1587144110.0,Aw well shucks!
piercing,fnpe1z6,t3_g367jy,1587143876.0,"For background: I previously had double nostrils (one on each side) and impulsivity got the better of me and I decided to double up with the above photos. I feel like they’re angled down too much as opposed to straight across and front on it almost looks like I have a high nostril. 
I’ve had the front piercing since October and is pretty well healed but still bleeds from time to time. Does anyone else have angled piercings like this or am I overreacting? Lol"
relationship_advice,fnembsu,t1_fnb45cn,1586891922.0,Absolutely. I wish someone would have told me about her so I wouldn’t have wasted my time
relationship_advice,fnem2vy,t1_fnel27g,1586891794.0,I think I’m going to I’m just waiting on a good time and good way
relationship_advice,fne1ypq,t1_fndss1u,1586881634.0,Thank you
relationship_advice,fndsjs2,t1_fnbsigz,1586876678.0,I do have her email but it’s a student email through our university. I felt like that may look a little desperate
relationship_advice,fnb9hu2,t1_fnb97dm,1586811569.0,I’m really not. I’m hurt by the things he said to me but I really feel like someone needs to know. It’s a shame his friends all know but won’t tell her
relationship_advice,fnb85ai,t1_fnb45cn,1586810894.0,I would but my issue is that many times people don’t believe things and seeing as I don’t have her phone number I’d need to do this over social media like FB. I’m also afraid of him getting the messages again
relationship_advice,fnb81zq,t1_fnb4kfn,1586810847.0,I guess I’m just unsure how to tell her. A friend of mine had suggested just sending a screenshot of some texts with his number at the top and not saying anything? I’ve never been in this position before and I feel very awkward and also I don’t necessarily want her to kno who I am
FacebookCringe,flt6fir,t3_fqzm9w,1585460762.0,Idk that’s kinda actual factual imo
AmItheAsshole,fl5hu55,t1_fl5fpfx,1584837071.0,I was also thinking anonymous account. Thanks!
AmItheAsshole,fl5fhqp,t1_fl5dov0,1584835500.0,Noted from experience. Would your use your personal account or create a new one? I can see advantages to both of these scenarios....
offmychest,fjhl3qm,t1_fjhk0df,1583350217.0,He is I just didn’t make the shift for this post
Vent,fhw2ko3,t3_f4z2u2,1581905072.0,"That sounds like a fucking gourmet cake I would have eaten it for sure. Happy birthday though, even if people do suck."
AmItheAsshole,fhnkpc4,t1_fhngvtm,1581728099.0,I agree too
AmItheAsshole,fhnkogo,t1_fhnhlqi,1581728086.0,True
AmItheAsshole,fhnkn7n,t1_fhnh357,1581728068.0,Lol don’t have feelings it’s just annoying 🙃
AmItheAsshole,fhnklyp,t1_fhniek2,1581728050.0,I have other things I’m focused on she was just the confusing part because I actually have to work with her a lot and being friends with her is more convenient than not if you catch me. However I’m just working on cutting her off and yea I agree
AmItheAsshole,fhnkhne,t1_fhnjbsy,1581727986.0,That made me laugh lol
AmItheAsshole,ff1ax9o,t1_ff1ablv,1579476937.0,Because it’s a recent relationship that I’m guessing is over and tbh “friend” was most civil word I was willing to use for him rn
AmItheAsshole,ff1a01s,t1_ff19b8d,1579476712.0,Was literally asking if I would be the a** here. I wasn’t asking if me calling him a friend was shady or if our relationship was toxic
AmItheAsshole,ff190t7,t1_ff18psa,1579476430.0,Yea I’m just debating on when to do it. I’m actually debating ghosting him. I’ve left him on read for about 3 hrs now
AmItheAsshole,ff18hrc,t1_ff181e8,1579476291.0,This happened yesterday and my friend lives in the apartment building over but they utilize the same lot so I’ve been back and his car is still there. It’s absolutely his car as his car has some differentiations on it. Also LOL I’m thinking more on the lines of he’s visiting an old flame 😕
piercing,fcloq9v,t3_ehntin,1577752788.0,Why not both? But I vote nostril because they look amazing on everyone and also you have a nice face for a nose hoop or even stud imo
piercing,fbajkjc,t3_ec97aq,1576679847.0,Double nostril!
piercing,f8jh4k0,t1_f8iebzv,1574600229.0,"I’m thinking of doing this! And you should, double piercings are trendy and fun iml"
piercing,f8h4tdr,t1_f8h3afn,1574569490.0,Something I would consider!
piercing,f8h4r74,t1_f8h3bkc,1574569465.0,Aw thank you! I do have a liking for the paired not gonna lie
piercing,f8gztto,t3_e0nbo6,1574567504.0,It looks perfect on you!
piercing,f8gzq8n,t1_f8gy3ng,1574567464.0,Thank you! Yea I’m kind of torn on both but you’re right that one side is more unique
piercing,f7mtj9g,t3_dwx4nf,1573873266.0,I have one and out of all of my cartilage piercings it healed the best and I have a lot. It pinches but otherwise it’s fine
piercing,f7dbz3p,t3_dvgk8a,1573612801.0,Do you have two on each side? Also I really love the setup it suits you well. I used to have one on each side but traded it for a double on the same side and I miss my symmetry lol
piercing,f7dbrw5,t3_dvic8j,1573612654.0,I love that conch piece! But I think a Tragus would work really well
AmItheAsshole,f6yecz9,t3_dtlm9z,1573276622.0,"NTA- I feel like you’ve answered our own questions here. You’re not the ass hole, it’s perfectly normal for you to not be comfortable with your gf being a stripper. It’s also perfectly fine for her to want to be one. If you’re not ok with it you two should break up."
piercing,f6xh5i5,t3_dthx7k,1573249475.0,"Medusa most definitely. While I agree that a vertical labret would look great as well, I think a Medusa would compliment your septum and nostrils really beautifully!"
piercing,f6svhyp,t3_dsvnwp,1573140340.0,I just got mine done a few weeks ago as well and I love it. Definitely one of my fave piercings. You totally rock it by the way!
AmItheAsshole,f6kc080,t3_drm2ww,1572909787.0,NTA - You take extra steps to dispose of them. Has he ever had a gf? It sounds like he’s really immature and doesn’t know what a period is lmao. I get not wanting a problem but I don’t see that there is one- tell him to stop going through the trash
bipolar,f6gz8q5,t3_dr969u,1572833429.0,Man this is like real. No one ever thinks about memory loss but it’s really a thing especially when going from mania to lows. I forget so much shit and people remind me of it and it’s like “oh yea....”
piercing,f4op40f,t3_dl5lo4,1571705131.0,Do it! I had double nostrils on each side and just recently took them out and replaced it with a double on the same side. I miss it and want them back!
HairDye,f1c3cdu,t1_f1c22tj,1569348969.0,Oh yeah. Sorry I had a dyslexic moment
HairDye,f1beo8j,t3_d8mce5,1569332656.0,"Your hair Is pretty light. I would honestly say it’s around a level 2/3. Definitely light enough for pastels! I can’t really give you advice on hair color that won’t stain though, because it all will, I’m guessing a light pink/ purple would fade the easiest though? I just know blues and greens are pretty impossible to get rid of"
piercing,f13wguf,t3_d7n2oh,1569166400.0,Love it. The dainty Medusa piercing is adorable too
piercing,eytmwwk,t3_cyp6ts,1567440655.0,I think a double nostril would look fabulous tbh!

piercing,eu19ffz,t3_ce7a5n,1563363072.0,Much better. You can see the other one was too low. Looks amazing!
femalehairadvice,etcvv21,t1_etcryev,1562693722.0,"Noted! I think you actually commented on my post and gave me some advice tho, like actual advice not creepy advice haha"
femalehairadvice,etcrj8m,t3_cb2uo3,1562691136.0,"Just posted first time asking for advice and got similar DMs. I responded kindly but thought it was awkward and weird and it’s also making me feel better that this is apparently a trend? Tbh I just thought it was some dude thinking I’d look better shaved down. Lol, either way I deleted my posted >.<"
femalehairadvice,etc1ifx,t1_etbrj31,1562671968.0,That looks really cute and is something like what I’m considering  lol
femalehairadvice,etay6lp,t1_etaotei,1562632208.0,You’re too kind! Definitely thinking of a good chop but bangs are actually my one stipulation as they’re too high maintained lol
AmItheAsshole,eskltxt,t1_esirphe,1562068179.0,"I’m not sure. I’ve thought of both scenarios tbh, but either way there was definitely parts to the story that were flat out untrue in the case that *any* of it had validity."
AmItheAsshole,esjj4ed,t1_esigjn9,1562034270.0,"Well the thing of it is that this happened months ago. Probably about 3 or so, I’ve just slowly cut contact and stopped responding, stopped sharing personal details, etc, no engagement. It’s just recently that she’s been kind of thrusting herself at me and texting/commenting on social media a lot and I keep ignoring or giving minimal responses."
AmItheAsshole,esjiyrs,t1_esif270,1562034171.0,"She’s 26. She also has a lot of health issues that her being pregnant would be highly risky for her. Actually probably impossible. She’s also on an IUD so, I kind of feel like pregnancy was pretty uncommon at that point"

drugstoreMUA,ep8c18l,t1_ep87vvr,1559092972.0,I’m glad you found something! I love the L’Oréal truematch blushes and face powders and have gone through a similar issue of trying to find a bronzer shade so I kno the struggle! Lmao
drugstoreMUA,ep7gi06,t3_bu5zzg,1559081516.0,Have you tried using L’Oréal true match pressed powders in cool tones? I get a darker one and it works like a bronzer. Also no sheen
