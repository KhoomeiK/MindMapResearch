DebateAnAtheist,f10g5t5,t3_d7d0gt,1569112051.0,"Im a theist.  I have read that some atheists believe that if God is all knowing,and knows everything. God knew that Adam and Eve will commit the sin of eating the forbidden fruit.  A loving God flooded the earth,killed everyone in the time of noah.  So how is God all knowing? All love? If he intentionally knew they would sin.  Does that sound like a loving God?

Atheists ask these type of question,i dont blame them for not believing in God."

The ex is showing she is crazy. If he starts acting crazy after you show him the texts,then the ex might be speaking the truth.   If you show him the text and he reacts calmy,then the text is probably a lie."

bipolar,evdtrgd,t3_cjfa73,1564447265.0,"Rationalizing is a difficult skill.  Best way i can describe it is like this.  Since you are aware that you have anger issues.  Monitor your anger every single time now.  When the anger comes up it makes you think different things.   I will give you an example of what happened to me.

One day my anger started to build,i didnt even realize i was angry.  I was sitting in a parking lot.  Some guy in another car said to me,""You shouldnt be sitting there"".  I felt like snapping on that guy.  I thought he was being a dick, being an asshole,being a  diva But before i said anything i watched his behaviour.  He was acting calm,smiling a bit.  I realized after that he wasnt being a dick,he was being sensitive and was watching out for me on my best interest.

This is my best tip. When you get angry,dont trust your judgment,but watch that persons behaviour.  Behaviour doesnt lie.  You know how a person behaves when angry.  Try and learn how to judge someone by their behaviour,not by what they say.  People lie,behaviour doesnt.

I dont trust my judgment when angry.  I watch their behaviour to see what is going on.  Took me years to figure out this skill. Hopefully you can do what i was able to do."
bipolar,evdhdx9,t3_cjfa73,1564438286.0,"I know its extremely hard,but if possible.  Think before you speak.  If you dont have nothing nice to say,say nothing at all.  Anger clouds your judgment,you think the people are offending you,but are not.  Its just the illness talking.

If something offensive happens,keep your mouth shut and think really hard. Did this person really offend me or not? I try and see from that persons perspective to see if that person offended me or not.

When people offend me,i take a moment to think about the situation and see if they actually offended me.  Sometimes i take a day to rethink that moment,and by then the anger passed.  I keep my mouth shut a lot.
 
I know the anger is killing you from the inside.  But you need to realize that its the illness, it take a big person to control their anger.  If you can learn to manage it,that will be a big step."

I was surprised myself at what religious people believe about their God.  How corrupt the books are.  How religious figures pick and choose verses that sound good to the ear.  They talk about the easy stuff,but cant talk about the hard stuff. The original translation is lost ,so people dont know whats orginial anymore.

I dont promote religion anymore because the books are corrupted.  I still believe in the divine books, but i dont talk about religion in public."
religion,euw3hhm,t3_cho11f,1564069523.0,"My faith is weird.  I follow judaism because of the torah, not because of what a rabbi said or any person said.  

Once reading the torah i realized that jesus wasnt the messiah.  There are so many prophecies about the messiah that when he comes,there will be no denial of him because of the prophecies written in the torah.  

I left christianity because of this.  The torah,bible,quran are all divinely inspiried.  But because of our sin and pride. The jews,christians,and muslims cant accept the fact that its from the same God.  

There are so many flaws in the torah,quran,bible that ita understandble why atheists dont believe these books are divine.

Thats why the messiah has to come and resolve these issues.

Jeremiah 8:8 talks about how the scribes changed the word of God.  This makes alot of sense. People have been healed in the name of jesus,allah, hashem . Religious people are really ignorant in the fact that god heals in all religions and they never thought and realized that their own divine books are corrupted. That the torah,bible,quran were from the same God.   But satan changed the worlds in the books to split the religions.  Satan deceived adam and eve.  He deceived the world by corrupting the holy books.  In the bible their is a prophecy where satan deceived the world.  But it said the world,not the non christians. That includes christians also. But still people are stubborn that their god is the right god. Their is only one God. Who he is. Why he heals in all religions.  We dont know.

The messiah needs to come and address these issues."
