SuicideWatch,fov4oih,t1_fov2uas,1588095329.0,"For the first one I’d say that if at any point In time in the future you decide it’s too hard you still have the same choice you do now so you can make the final call then and die after finding out if it was or wasn’t too much. However, if you kill yourself now you don’t get to know if it wasn’t too hard to stick around with him, because you just die and you have the same outcome without the possibility of benefiting your friend by sticking around. Because I mean you can recall your decision to stick around at any point. For the second one, I’d say that there are two types of ways we help someone. Actively and passively, we do the second by not even trying or knowing that we do it. In friendships or relationships with other people we often passively help them. They keep us around because they feel like they benefit from talking to us, having someone to talk to, feeling less alone, being able to be more honest with someone etc, or simply having someone else around you find semi comforting. There are some signs that you are passively helping him quite a bit enough for him to care if you were to die. Just some food for thought tbh"

BPD just requires that you learn the skills to realize the things our brains do so you can cope and change it :) I’ve been there with the therapist thing too, but going to therapy was super helpful it was definitely the help I always needed.

latebloomerlesbians,fof3a9e,t3_g6xk04,1587724475.0,Look into demi sexuality it’s when you are sexually aroused only after strong emotional connection you can be demisexual and bi maybe that explains why you were able to be aroused at that point in your relationship. I recommend watching YouTube vids on it or looking on reddit. I am demisexual and pan. I am mainly aroused by feminine people however I need emotional connection of some sort to feel sexual attraction. I am aroused by female bodies the most and the easiest however I do occasionally feel sexual attraction towards feminine men whom I have a strong emotional connection with.
latebloomerlesbians,fof2o1f,t3_g6wwot,1587723824.0,You could be biromantic and lesbian. Biromanic is the ability to feel romantic love towards both genders or more etc. You can indeed be biromantic and lesbian which would explain the romantic feelings but lack of sexual attraction.

Were you trying to release a feeling? Were you trying to bury a feeling? It sounds like you hav had very poor emotional regulation skills (which sometimes need to be learned) and things got out of hand. For the cats sake, you can take care of other cats in the future but I think you need to uncover why you really did it and learn the skills to prevent it from happening ever again. I choked my dog a few times when I was a kid, because I also self harmed and didn’t have emotional regulation skills. It was a disgusting feeling but it happened a few times before I was able to control that anger. And even longer before I was able to not hurt myself. You owe the Cat to really address the issue that lead to its death. Of course a therapist would be the best option because they are able to help us with things we can’t see our selfs, please try your best to do that or get a therapy book if u really really can’t talk to a therapist."

Fibromyalgia,fmqy9k9,t3_fuqzzf,1586309677.0,"So the things i can recommend that help comfort me is lots of pillows while in bed. A pillow under my knees for back support or on my side a pillow in between my legs. A heavy blanket or weighted blanket helps distract from my nerve pain. Applying bio freeze a gel that makes your skin feel tingly helps distract From the pain a lot as well. Heating packs or heating blankets are a god send and if she has hot flashes having a hand fan or putting a fan on a chair by her bed helps a lot as well. I now use medical CBD marijuana so i only get pain relief no high but I know a low dose of CBD oil helps like a gabapentin pill would for nerve pain ( for me a gabapentin pill reduces my nerve pain quite a bit but not quite enough) I recommend getting the highest dose CBD oil you can and blue bird the website has CBD Isolate which is basically just pure hemp so it doesn’t show on a drug test because it doesn’t contain anything other than CBD ( hemp). I know also for me that when others make me feel loved it often helps my mental state as I feel alone in my struggle with the pain when im experiencing a flare up of pain.

Edit: CBD Oil is expensive however if you can afford it and get her functional again shed possibly be able to work and make money to afford more than just a few bottles. And depending on her tolerance she may only need a few drops.

Edit: Lightly stretching helps my body to not feel as achy or stiff, I stretch when i get up because im stiff and then i feel semi normal again. I also put my legs against a wall up in the air on my bed with my but against the wall and it reduces my leg pain and any swelling. 

As for the depression, I highly recommend just making sure that she has clean clothes and meals throughout the day. When im in pain i cant clean my own clothes and can barely cook cometimes so i wont eat and it makes me feel more sick and depressed. Basic things like talking with them, or sitting outside with them, watching a documentary they are interested in or aa funny movie can help distract them."

depression,fi0ky0y,t3_f5kmc2,1582039345.0,"This reminds me of when I gave my friends like a three day notice I was going to have a small birthday party that weekend and only one person I invited came. The other girl was a girl from my grandmas church who lived around the corner in a bad family dynamic who I thought would be cool to go over and invite a day before or that day or something. I actually ended up having a lot of fun but I was really devastated the day before as each of my friends told me they couldn’t come. 
Even tho only one person from school came it still had a very nice outcome as I enjoyed showing them how to make jewelry lol and I got to keep all the nail polish I was going to give the other girls lmao XD 

The lesson in this odd rant about a memory Is Treat yo self Lmao

Oh edit: none of them even knew when my birthday was anyways lmao I really didn’t have good friends"
emotionalsupport,fi0ilk7,t3_f5qbyr,1582037827.0,"I would tell her that you love and support her no matter what. And that she can talk to you about anything if she needs to and if not you’ll just be here to love and comfort her because it’s okay to be sad.
Edit: she may already know this but I’ve found telling them really helps"

NonBinaryTalk,fhwkxlg,t3_f47eap,1581919197.0,"Hey, I’m Gloria. I’m 19 as well. Ooph it’s a long story how I came to figure it out. Basically my bf got taken away from me by his abusive controlling mother our junior year summer, then went to an Asian country for a month. We were able to Skype occasionally and message over the computer until one week he stayed at his grandmas with no internet. He finally texts me a week or two later. They realized That they were a trans girl. This freaked me out because 1. I had gone from being with them every day to not seeing them for almost three months and not having really any communication for about 2 of those months. It was like they just disappeared then came back a different person (I had abandonment and serious change adverse issues ) I was scared that she had changed too much and we weren’t going to make it as well as my family would disown me. 

They found out, I was semi emotionally abused for a month or two now they love me regardless soooOo. But anyways I didn’t understand at the time how she could feel like a girl because I didn’t feel like anything and was born afab so I didn’t understand really, I was just terrified as well. 

The funny thing is before she told me I had mentioned how nice it would be if I had a dick lmao XD. 

Anyways I knew I’d love her regardless and decided to ignore my family and stay with her because In all actuality I loved her so much, I was just so so so scared that my head wasn’t working. 

A few weeks later while we were talking about gender she encouraged me to look into mine because the way I talked about it. And here I am lol. We are still together a year and a half ? ? Later, very proud to call her my beautiful gf :3 
This was my first and only relationship as well so very freaking complicated"
demisexuality,fhwas6l,t3_f4z2mu,1581910773.0,"Oh I made sex jokes a lot lmao so I was a little bit more wild than my friends I just like a good joke what can I say. I felt isolated for a lotttt of other reasons, but my friends all told me they thought I’d be the first one to have sex which kinda made me angery at the time because just because I was crazy doesn’t mean I want to like uknow with someone
Edit: my friends were not the crush hook up talking type"
SuicideWatch,fhqk5j2,t1_fhpec3v,1581805640.0,People with Aspd to my understanding I could be wrong can in fact feel those emotions but to a much lesser degree and often feel anger more/ don’t empathize easily as well from what I’ve seen people with aspd say and whatnot
