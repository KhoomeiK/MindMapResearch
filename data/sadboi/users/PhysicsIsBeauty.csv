schizophrenia,fo4n5e4,t1_fo403f3,1587507463.0,"I can only speak from my experience. Only a doctor can tell you if it is a symptom. 

In my case, I know it is one of the building blocks of my delusions. There are many others of course, but that's where it starts.

Once a small number of believable delusions are established, there is a snowball effect. Notice how each statement is not that much crazier than the previous one:

- I believe people speak with me indirectly
- I believe people can predict my decisions
- I believe people can predict my thoughts
- I believe people can read my thoughts
- I believe people can control my thoughts
- I believe people think my thoughts

To me, the critical step was from statement 3 to 4. That jump was the tipping point for me to fall into all sorts of delusional thinking. It's not hard to believe that people control your thoughts, if you already believe they can read them."
schizophrenia,fo3x7rz,t3_g5e6cx,1587494476.0,"I now have classes at home. So I took the liberty to record them. I realized something that actually chocked me.

**Most of what I perceive during a conversation is not what is actually happening.**

Remember suggesting to the professor some software to be used in class. From the way I remember it, he was mad, fed up with me, losing his patience. I felt like he hated me. I could tell from his tone of voice. 

Upon revisiting the video I recorded, I noticed that  nothing was happening. It was just a professor with a montone voice asking for further details and saying he was gonna look into it. 

It was the first class, *we had never met before*, in fact, until now, he never saw my face or even heard my voice, since I always write in chat instead of participating in the videoconference . 

It's one of those things you never consider as a possibility until you literally see it happening. 

And this is how I found out how my psychosis truly works. My perception of other people's emotions is distorted during a conversation. I then overthink what happened, resulting in untrue beliefs about the world. Things like ""everyone hates me"", ""they are plotting to destroy me"" or ""they are sending me a message""."

I feel the same.

But does it matter though? I think that being the best shouldn't be the objective."

> radiation¬†is the emission or transmission of¬†energy¬†in the form of¬†waves¬†or¬†particles¬†through space or through a material medium

So, anything that waves(like sound) or anything small that travels through space (like electrons) is radiation.

 I've actually seen  a lot of terminology in common when studying ultrasounds and radiation physics. For example, the term radiation dose exists in both fields. 

Certain radiation types, like high energy photons (photons are ""particles of light"") can rip off electrons from your atoms/molecules and proteins. These electrons go on to collide with even more atoms/molecules, ripping off more electrons on the way.

Having a bunch of electrons bouncing around in your tissue is not good. They will damage your DNA, potentially causing cancer.

To top it all off, the molecules that lose their electron rarely are happy about it, so they also reek havok on your cells.

Examples of radiation:

- visible light (not dangerous in most situations)
- UV radiation(light, but with more energy per particle, so it can damage cells)
- ultrasound waves 
- normal sound waves
- protons 
- helium atoms 
- gamma rays (also light, but very very energetic)

Simplest way to create radiation: turn on a lamp.

portugal,fkk29bw,t1_fkgzcwa,1584270481.0,">quem tem mais probabilidade de se insurgir contra a quarentena √© precisamente a malta da minha idade e mais novos.

N√£o tenho visto isso, de todo. A rotina dos meus av√≥s nao muda, continuam a ir ao caf√©, riem-se da situa√ß√£o e menosprezam qualquer tipo de cautela - confundem atitudes de precau√ß√£o com cobardice.

Em contrapartida, n√£o conhe√ßo ningu√©m da minha gera√ß√£o(~25 anos) que n√£o esteja a tomar precau√ß√µes. Sei de uma colega que iniciou quarentena muito antes de qualquer medida governamental, para salvaguardar a sa√∫de dos pais/av√≥s.

N√£o pretendo inferir nada, at√© porque o grupo de pessoas que conhe√ßo √© uma amostra muito pequena da popula√ß√£o. 

No entanto, discordo com a tentativa (talvez n√£o intencional) de criar divis√µes entre gera√ß√µes. Creio que agora √© altura de manter cabe√ßa fria e responder, dentro dos poss√≠veis, como um povo unido."
