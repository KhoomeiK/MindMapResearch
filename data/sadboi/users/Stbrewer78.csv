 There was this church that several of my friends attended in Washington state. They taught some type of “freedom from generational curses” studies that people had to commit to for 4 months. After they completed they were then encouraged to change their old name and chose a name that had a special meaning.

BipolarReddit,fr3igzr,t3_gmcna6,1589858118.0,"Yes. I also have people tell me all the time they have never known anyone that’s gone through more loss and tragedy than I have. I was get tired of hearing it but I do know that I have had an extraordinary amount of pain in my life so I know what they’re saying is valid.

 Please don’t take this as condemnation because it’s not but I do believe that we can self sabotage the good things in our life by or negative thinking. 
 Every thought that you have has an actual chemical reaction in your brain. Thoughts send out energy and vibration. It is through vibration and energy that all things we see are created. Your brain begins to learn to think the way that it’s been trained to. It is extremely pliable. Your thoughts restructure your wiring in the brain. It takes effort and time to change your natural reaction from negative to positive. But the awesome thing is that after working about 5 weeks, your brain picks up the work and it responds positively as it’s new natural reaction. 

 I used to be the most negative person there is. I mean, I could not see the good things in life if I had tried. The strange thing is it took God allowing me to walk through losing my marriage, my children, my home, and both of my parents in a short amount of time for me to realize to appreciate life. It is completely up to me if I’m gonna have a thankful, grateful life and a happy one or if  I’m going to be miserable and negative, hating life. 

 I want to live it well and live it in a way that shows God I am thankful for all He has done for me. 
  
 Allow yourself to embrace the good things that you deserve. Do not believe the lie that whispers, “you aren’t good enough, you don’t deserve good things.” You do and I pray you feel Gods love for you do that you can love yourself!"
BipolarReddit,fr3hddn,t1_fr3ergc,1589857447.0,"Yes!!! I’ve had horrible anxiety like I haven’t had since my late 20’s. I almost had a panic attack and it’s been 14 years since my last one.

BipolarReddit,fr3gqdu,t3_gmfavt,1589857065.0,"I had the same thing happen to me August 2018. I was sexually assaulted by a stranger ( who was stalking me, unbeknownst to me). That triggered me and I had a full Mania induced psychotic break. It literally took me over a year to start finding stability again. I had to move 2000 miles away so I could be back with my family and support system. Moving meant losing my job that I loved and I also had 2 semesters left to finish my psychology degree ( I’m a Chemical dependency counselor). 
   I think you are finally turning the corner here. You’ve had some time to accept what occurred and make adjustments. 

I know it’s hard but try not to allow fear effect or impact a welcomed shift and an answer to prayer. Fear can often be the root of self sabotage so we have to remember to yank that up from the root. Replace fearful thoughts with positive affirmations and in time, your brain literally learns to respond positively rather than fearfully. Our brains are so incredible and pliable. We can truly change our “wiring” by training our thoughts.

You deserve all of the good things that others have. You truly do. Do not short change yourself. This isn’t an easy road, you’ve done the best you can with a difficult situation, you will be stronger now because of that. So... go enjoy the goodness God has for you!"
BipolarReddit,fr3f0z7,t3_gmcc0n,1589856009.0,"I had my first psychotic “break” 2 years ago when I was 40 years old. It was shocking to me that I had bipolar as well but it does help me fill in the puzzle pieces that I never seemed able to find. 

 You’ll grow so much as you accept this as just a part of life but know it doesn’t define your identity.

 I think that if you don’t give your boyfriend the space, freedom, and trust that is needed now, you risk losing him for good. If you are struggling now imagine not knowing where he is and not being able to communicate anymore either. 
 
 He is your boyfriend but he’s not your counselor. I have learned that I can’t expect my man to be my counselor, if I put that burden on him, since it’s not his to bear, it’s exhausting. I don’t want to exhaust my man. I want to add to his life and build him up, not have unrealistic expectations that he can’t meet.

 It took me 38 years and lots of mistakes to realize that no one else is responsible for my happiness. If I’m not happy, then I need to do self inventory on where *I* need to change things. My worth doesn’t come from anywhere and anyone else besides my God and myself. 

 Write a plan on paper and do not deviate from it. If you guys have agreed to only talk 2 days a week for 6 weeks, than stick to the plan on paper. I think he will also appreciate you for this sign of growth. It’s respectful and it’s thinking of his needs, just as he has though of snd considered yours."
BipolarReddit,fr3e0nd,t3_gmazt2,1589855380.0,"That’s not bipolar, that’s her being selfish ( IMO). 
It’s not a marriage if she can do whatever she wants, when she wants and not even live with you. It’s a case of that old, “ wants her cake and wants to eat it too.” 

A marriage is a union that requires BOTH partners to give, not just 50% each, but 100%. She cannot help the instability of highs and lows, I know it’s not her fault she is bipolar but it’s not your cross to completely carry for her either. 

I believe in marriage and believe in fighting for them. But you can’t be in a marriage alone. That’s what she’s asking. It’s not okay to play around with your heart and emotions. I think that you should be very firm with her and let her know that if she leaves again, you will move on and not look back.

Sometimes people will yank you around by our hearts until we refuse to allow it. If she loves you, she will listen to you and realize she has to be here for you as well. If she wants to play games, let her do it. Just not with you anymore. 

Sometimes it’s behavior we allow that keeps breaking our own hearts. You deserve a fully invested partner, nothing less!"
BipolarReddit,fr3cmqg,t1_fr2zvpq,1589854536.0,"Yes. That’s exactly what I want to ask my psych. 

 I think it’s made me moody. I know this may sound like an anomaly because I have bipolar, but I’m not moody in general. I have consistent highs, consistent lows, and prolonged consistent stability ( until this lamictal). I went without any meds for 5.5 years and had stability (no mania or depression) right before 2018.
I am not the bipolar that is mad one minute and laughing the next, then homicidal, etc. I don’t get angry very easy, someone has to try very hard go get me angry. I’ve just gone through so much loss and trauma in the last decade that it’s helped me put things into perspective. Life is too short to not smile and laugh and enjoy as much of it as we can.

I think one reason that I wasn’t diagnosed until age 40 is because of not being moody. I didn’t realize bipolar also presents itself uniquely as individual beings."

 I could not See - I was blind and “disappearing” into this scary nothingness. It was the most alone, dark, and tormenting feeling of “nothing.” Absent of light and laughter and colors and other people. 

I was begging God to take me out of that place of “nothing” and as soon as I started praying aloud, I wasnslowly “pixelating” back into existence. There were 100 thoughts all at once passing my mind and I could see ( all at once yet also separate ) this history of ancestors before me almost as if it was information stored in Gods data bank as His formula for creating me. It’s so hard to articulate it in words but the “disappearing” feeling and the “nothingness” were terrifying. 

 I came out of it wondering if I experienced a tiny fraction of eternity separated from God because all existence ceased. I don’t know but I know that I’ve clung to my faith much tighter and have no doubt that absent my faith, I would’ve had a complete mental breakdown over that experience.

If a person believes in God, they also believe He is the Creator ( at least the Christian God - Hebrew God). If He created humans, than He created DMT as the physical avenue for people to experience Him while on earth.

 We are VERY much alike. I have had a pretty remarkable amount of trauma occur to me- beginning in my childhood. I also had intense- overwhelming fear issues as a child ( still do at times - for instance, I’m still scared of the dark). I also have had a counselor ( I actually am a Substance Abuse counselor myself  ) assert that I have had more trauma ( probably sexual in nature) that I blocked out because I have years that I have zero memory plus memories that, like you, I still don’t understand and there’s clearly a missing puzzle piece. 

I wasn’t diagnosed with PTSD until I was full on attacked and sexually assaulted by a stranger ( that had been stalking me, unbeknownst to me) the summer of 2018. That experience “triggered” such horrible PTSD that I literally couldn’t eat nor sleep for 3.5 days and then after those 3.5 days, I had a full on “psychotic break.” In fact, I was initially arrested until it was apparent it was a medical/mental health crisis ( my magnesium, potassium and sodium levels were dangerously low and electrolyte imbalance can create severe mental confusion ). 
I still had to quit my job at a college and move back “home” ( which was across the country) because my breakdown after the attack was so bad that I needed to be with my family. That’s how I received the PTSD diagnosis. I truly had no idea that I had PTSD. I’ve dealt with such severe anxiety at one point in my 20’s that I became agoraphobic. I also deal with panic attacks and bipolar depression ( didn’t know I had bipolar or ADHD until the same diagnosis in 2018). It was nice to finally have names of why I am the way that I am. I suspected bipolar for a long while but basically was so afraid of the diagnosis that I ran away from it- until I had no choice after the court was involved ( judge required I receive mental health evaluation and then treatment - trauma classes - in order for my legal case to end). 

 I attended trauma classes for 2 months and that helped me IMMENSELY! I don’t know if you would be interested in classes like that but they were a life changer for me. I never have understood myself ( until now) and felt like I was just failing at “adulting.” I tried so hard to be “normal” but didn’t seem to know how. Now I understand why?"

He asked if I was okay, which I thought was a little odd but then he came and knocked asking it again. So I said, “Yes, I told you I’m okay.

Another night, I was plucking my eyebrows and kind of blinked, almost like I felt like I was coming to and I’d been in there 2.5 hours plucking my eyebrows! It’s like I’m experiencing a time warp.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fr0hlz7,t1_fqybi3i,1589795959.0,I’m so glad you realize it’s not failing. an opiate addiction is one of the hardest addictions to break. I’m proud of you and OP for seeking help. You are brave and I’m so glad you both have a new chance at really living!
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fr0hdwa,t3_glfnmv,1589795726.0,"I’m not on it but I wanted to tell you to not be hard on yourself, it’s not easy to end an addiction and you’ve made amazing progress. Even if you have to stay on it for *years*, it’s not a sign of failing. It’s a sign that you’ve sought help! It takes great strength to do that!

As for how you ended up with another strip, I don’t know but God has done amazing things for people so maybe it was Him letting you know that He loves you and sees your effort in this journey."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fr0gqmy,t3_gle0tp,1589795063.0,"I had an ex that was actually diagnosed with *narcissistic personality disorder.* He actually did exactly what U maybe did (??) did to you. He even admitted it later on.
It’s called *gas lighting.* You may want to google the term and read about it. 

Your friend could be totally innocent. I never imagined adults dud things like this just to make you feel crazy but ones that aren’t well ( unless it’s a harmless joke) do.

Edited to add another thought.

Does anyone in your apartment take Ambien? When I took it, I would get up and cook and rearrange my furniture while on it, then wake up the next day assuming I was in bed asleep after taking it. Lol
I had one friend that would call people after taking it but had no memory and another friend who actually was driving on it! She ran over the neighbors mailbox, left her car in the neighbors yard and went back to bed. 

You can do some weird stuff on Ambien."

I  “have the feeling” Im gonna take a shower, later on in the shower, I realize , “hey wait! I had a feeling I was going to do this. “

 It reminds me of the time i went to a dyslexic psychic. She told me everything I did last week."

 Anyway, your brain can actually start a “dream” before you fall asleep. It happens when your brain and body are tired so I’m seriously guessing that’s what you had. You really did see all of that and had you actually been asleep, it would’ve been a dream. 
I’ve had the opposite of this happen- I’ve had my brain wake up before my body woke up. So I woke up but I couldn’t move and I couldn’t speak but I was wide awake and could see ( it’s called sleep paralysis). 
I’ll try to look up the word for what happened to you."

BipolarReddit,fr0b4zn,t1_fqzyu3p,1589789491.0,"Oh wow. I am so sorry. That breaks my heart for you.

 I’m a Christian. I was married to a pastor for 13 years. My illness didn’t manifest until our 7th year of marriage. My ex refused to let me seek help for it because he was so embarrassed, concerned what our church people would think, and tried rebuking demons out of me ( as did his father).
 I’ve been so disappointed in the Christian church by how they treat mental illness and addiction. 

I hope you know that Christians don’t always represent Christ ( although that’s what they are supposed to do). He is loving, inclusive, and accepts you as you are.

 None of us want this. It’s extremely difficult to manage and keep under control. 

 I also have lupus. It’s also very difficult to live with ( chronic pain - non stop) but mental illness is a lot harder in my opinion.

 I wish we all had the support and love we deserve. I’m glad we at least have places like this so we can remember we aren’t alone."
