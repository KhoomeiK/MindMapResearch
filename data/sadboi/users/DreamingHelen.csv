AskReddit,f0hhx73,t1_f0flsvl,1568622307.0,I’m married to a clown so I’ve had sex with a clown lots of times. We’re also both burlesque performers. He performs clown burlesque. Clowns are sexy and sex is clowny!
AskReddit,f0hhsiq,t1_f0gtbu2,1568622207.0,People probably already said this but I don’t really understand how Reddit works so I’m just gonna day this again: Fetlife.
AreYouTheOne,f03hthi,t1_f00vcrt,1568355859.0,Why should Remy and Paige be together? Paige didn’t want to be w Remy. What?
AreYouTheOne,f02sr01,t1_f01vyjf,1568337414.0,Aw. I didn’t know that happened. Danny DEFINITELY deserves to be treasured! Where do y’all get this info?

AreYouTheOne,f018y52,t1_f007fad,1568311834.0,Ew.
AreYouTheOne,f018s0u,t3_d31viw,1568311777.0,"Ok, I’ll admit that Danny deserved The Best. Like maybe on the level of Basit, but Basit is like 11/10 in my eyes, whereas Danny was just a Very Nice Guy Who Deserves Nice Things. 

However, I don’t really have much of an issue w Kai! Like, he’s a slut, ok, who cares? It just doesn’t bother me to be in a relationship w a slut; maybe what Kai needs is somebody who accepts him the way he is and doesn’t demand stuff of him that he never wanted to agree to in the first place. 

Like fucking NOUR was way out of line to treat Everybody the way she did. If I had been in Kai’s position, I probably would have ignored her too! Like, why is he gonna go out of his way to stop having fun, only to be yelled at by somebody he doesn’t even match with? No fucking thanks. 

It does bother me a bit that he allowed somebody else to be yelled at when he could have intervened but also, wtf was he even supposed to say? He wasn’t sorry for what he did and honestly had nothing to be sorry for. He wasn’t tied to Nour, he told her he was pursuing them both. 

Kai did nothing wrong."

What season is she on?"
AreYouTheOne,ezzhfg1,t1_ezzhb0t,1568286983.0,It’s just so bad! Almost none of these people are people that anybody should be in a relationship with.

AreYouTheOne,ezzdzd4,t3_d31viw,1568285327.0,Danny is cute af but I like Kai fine and think they could be good for each other!
AreYouTheOne,ezzdse3,t3_d2z8f5,1568285230.0,I dunno but Basit was my absolute fav and Jonathan was the WORRRRST. I’m glad Basit liked him in the end but good GOD they deserve better than that idiot.
Fibromyalgia,ezqud24,t1_ezqlkve,1568064062.0,"I use a walker. It’s really helpful, especially if I’m going somewhere without reliable/comfortable/available seating, because then I know I’ll have somewhere to sit."

SuicideWatch,ezo1mmj,t3_d1fx4w,1568015055.0,"I completely relate to this. One way I’ve found to balance it is to spend time in service to others. Personally I find volunteering with animals pretty fulfilling. Is there a shelter nearby where you could walk dogs? This would give you exercise and let them get out of their kennels for a bit. It’s nice. Plus dogs are great. OR, you could volunteer with the cats and just literally sit around petting cats and feel fulfilled at the same time."

blackmirror,esbk3sk,t3_bwznoy,1561796378.0,Can somebody please tell me what Danny gives Theo at the end? She gives him the VR piece and says she’ll want it back in the morning. He gives her something and says ditto. What did he give her?
