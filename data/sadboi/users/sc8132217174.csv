sandiego,fphd7wz,t3_gdenio,1588619195.0,"My husband bought around 5 years ago with VA and zero down.  When it came time for him to sell, our realtor made a spreadsheet of all offers including if it was VA, FHA, or traditional.  VA meant likely paying a bit more on the termite report and covering some closing costs that the buyer isn't allowed to pay for.  We understood for VA buyers that there isn't a need to put anything down for unless it's the 2nd time borrowing, in which case money down decreases the lending fee.  

Agree with others saying to write a letter.  For my husband's house I wrote some half truths about raising a family, deployments, and letting the dog run around in the backyard (we don't have a dog...).  When we chose a buyer, we were a bit less emotional and just went for the money, but the letters demonstrated a greater interest.  Our agent is a fierce woman who got him a house despite a lower offer when buying, and tons of offers bidding against each other when selling.  I think she just really enjoys winning."
AskReddit,fpfu5sh,t1_fpftfq4,1588583617.0,I want to say 10 or 11 when i graduated from college. My first job paid a sad 13 with no benefits working in a bio lab.  Minimum wage has been going up annually so it’s a bit difficult for me to keep up with.  Companies are also required to give at least three sick days now. But this is California so more worker friendly.
AskReddit,fpftpgv,t1_fpfs55q,1588583126.0,"Almost all highschools have football teams and if there is a football team there is likely a cheerleading squad. Sports are expensive. Whether buying equipment, going to camps, or travelling to away games. So the kids arent necessarily popular but are usually not poor. Typically outgoing types join sports as well. Perhaps the sports even contribute to their outgoing personalities by giving them frequent socialization. The cheerleaders undergo extensive dance and gymnastics training in addition to competitions and games. So also expensive and lots of socialization."

Which I get.  But anyone caring for geriatric pts trying to keep them out of the hospital has been at the end of the line.  Maybe now that will change since we're seeing u07.1 charts. 

Slip up on the schools, you’re correct they’re closed. Main point was that there are many per diem clinicians being caught without supplies, as they cannot pull the high order limits on their own, aren’t necessarily connected to a provider, and other outlets have shut out “public” purchases. So you get your clinician without easy access to PPE splitting time between settings, causing these outbreaks we're seeing."

weddingplanning,fovhwvl,t1_fot3hdy,1588101603.0,">e has always been set for 10/10/2020 and we were going to have about 100 people there. I’m tired of people asking if I’m moving it or what we’re doing or “how’s planning going?!” I don’t want to subject the elderly or autoimmune guests to having to choose on whether to come to my wedding or feel 100% safe by missing out and staying home. I think you hit the nail on the head talking about the uncertainty. We have no idea what the world will look like in October and that’s freaking me out most. I don’t want to plan and then have us hit the end of summer and suddenly we’re limiting sizes of gatherings again and we had false hope all summer, you know? At this point we’re seriously considering just doing something with the two of us and celebrating with only very immediate family (12 people) sometime in the future when we know everyone feels more comfortable. It’s such a bummer, I really just am so sad thinking about everything that has happened with this virus

Same date, same plan!  We started planning 2 years ago, we've already celebrated our wedding anniversary, and were just wanting something to officially tell friends and family we're legally married.  We were going to go all out and have a huge party & ceremony.  Now I'm trying to gamble on the CDC, city, or state banning weddings this far in advance so I can recuperate some of the 10k spent on deposits (probably taking an L on this).  No interest in continuing on with the wedding at some unknown, postponed date.  Also don't want to book any remaining vendors when I'm 100% sure I won't be risking my family's health or asking them to take time/fly in/pay for hotels after a financially devastating year.  

We've decided to just fly our super close friends and family (14 people) to Hawaii for a week when this is finally over.  We'll have a small ceremony on the beach, drink Mai-Tais, snorkel, relax."

Day 1 was good, then E turned down the future discussion while taking her to get naked and be touched in front of strangers.  She was outwardly annoyed at not having sex on day 1.  I wouldn't be very pleasant or intimate at that point either. Then of course having dating apps on the phone, twisting words (a ""can you delete it?"" turns to ""you made me delete it""), and crying/leaving without an adult conversation.  Was it that hard to show the app and say ""I know we've been online only, but I've been taking this seriously. This app is just for networking, see?"" Next day, telling the friends about the lack of intimacy and fighting right before meeting for the first time.  That would make me feel ganged up on.  Then going to a party with ex's.  Maybe not terrible, if anything else had gone well.  It just seems like a barrage of difficult situations with nothing to inspire closeness.  I'm honestly so surprised at the consensus that Stephanie is in the wrong.  She travelled, despite her health, to be put in really unfamiliar and unkind circumstances.  For sure some things were bad timing or poor execution, but I don't see her as controlling Erika, just standing her ground on infidelity and consent."

I can’t compare to cheaper options since I’ve never had those, but I appreciate the forgiving nature of my rice cooker. Whether I’m using a cup, my finger (only to make my mother in law happy), or eyeballing - it comes out delicious. No mushy rice, no dry rice.  Good on day 1, good for fried rice on day 3.

SuicideWatch,fntiuw1,t3_g3sz2y,1587242539.0,"It isn’t your fault that guidelines were released so late!  I’m so sorry that you were put in that situation.  Everyone has been trying to work with what they have and stay ahead of the game, but it’s hard when we’re dealing with something so new.  I believe the first case up in Washington was in a nursing home, so after that I saw tons of nursing homes shut down to per diems real fast. It was up to the administration to see/predict that there could be contamination and to take precautions. It’s not like they didn’t know that you and other clinicians work elsewhere.  You taking the blame for those above isn’t okay.

But if you still have guilt, then hopefully you can channel that energy in a way that makes you feel you’ve made amends. You already make a huge difference on a day to day basis, but you can strive to improve patient outcomes and experiences even more than you might have before. You can also channel some energy in to improving regulatory standards so that this never happens to another nurse. I’m sure there are programs who would appreciate your support."

In general, the importance of this on job training without significant barriers also shouldn’t be ignored. Schools that not only tell kids they aren’t smart enough, but also isolate subject matter from work, just disregards a significant portion of the population that is motivated to be a contributing part of the workforce.  That’s really where the military comes in.  You learn your job and you get to work at it for money.  Certainty and the stability of a paycheck every 1/15th. BAH matching cost of living.

The only reason I can see finishing is so that you can get in to something else (college/trade school). Same thing with college. I think there are a ton of jobs that don't require transcripts, so you write the degree on your resume and you've got it."

We're already prepping for new Medicare rules in 2020 that I personally feel are going to cause an unsafe drop in utilization just to maximize reimbursement rates. Meanwhile, we're watching to see how all of this plays out, set to take effect at the same time. Having a safe, cheap, quick ride from the bar was great. Ordering food when you're sick was great too. I know so many people who are sad at the loss of extra cash. But patient care is also likely going to be impacted when there are staffing shortages.  We've built more than just taxis on the framework of our new mobile world."
me_irl,ezyj2tk,t1_ezwm856,1568269031.0,"The Walmarts in San Diego have now locked up everything in glass cages and they put certain departments behind individual cash registers. This means if I want false eyelashes and a diuretic for my night out, I have to ask an employee to unlock the 2 dollar eyelashes, go to the makeup register to check out before leaving the area, stand in line while some lady in a mobility scooter complains she needs something from a case and was there first, watch the Walmart employee break down and yell at her, pay (not with Apple pay), go to the medicine aisle, ask an employee to unlock the case, tell him what I want, explain what it is when he asks, go to the mobile check out at the front (because I didn't want to interact with anyone this entire shopping trip after dealing with people all day at work), get approval for purchasing something for 18 and older/show my ID, pay (still only Walmart pay or card), show the guy at the door my receipt, tell the kids outside I don't have cash to buy their candy, finally stop interacting with strangers. 

Target, meanwhile, has redone their stores to feel more open and aesthetically pleasing with minimal interaction.  It's almost refreshing to go. For like an extra twenty cents per item. I really feel terrible, it's just another tax on the poor to have to deal with all that other nonsense."

Anyway, couldn't he have mitigated some of this by offering up some food or a monetary gift too? I know it annoyed me when I paid for some friends of our family to eat Korean BBQ and they didn't even try anything. It's like 40 a person and you agreed to come, so why waste my money? That's probably no where near the annoyance her family would feel, given it's even harder for them to provide meat to a guest. But I bet a 20 note would have made them less interested in his empty plate.

gadgets,ez88blh,t1_ez78qyn,1567736647.0,"We did our lights, thermostat, front door, Roomba, and garage door. The door was necessary because I lock myself out while getting the mail and am sometimes home alone for days/weeks/months. The garage was necessary because I apparently forget to close it and the neighbors get upset. The thermostat we got a rebate off our power bill. Plus it's nice to turn it on/off remotely. The lights are entirely because we're sometimes too lazy to go turn them on/off and like the colors.  Roomba I can start and stop at work. And get alerts when it inevitably gets stuck behind the couch or eats a charger I left hanging in the living room.  

 Would never suggest anyone needs this stuff to survive, but I like it."
MurderedByWords,ez80iyz,t1_ez79h9l,1567731365.0,"There are tons of factors but a big one is the lack of centralized bargaining.  No one is advocating for lower pricing. We also have a ton of Administrators because of the complexity of dealing with so many payors. And a majority of private plans (we have almost an even split between private plans and government, with private making up slightly more) are employer provided, so the patient has no direct way of complaining about cost or interacting with the true price. Plus everything is fragmented so your primary care is usually not related to your hospital or home health, hospice, anything.  The exception being care organizations like Kaiser. Lots of room for markup throughout the system. Any plans that try to bargain down rates, maybe the providers just tell them to go elsewhere. Like Medicaid plans. No one really wants their low reimbursements and would rather take those Gucci Medicare patients."

I told him to throw it away, I'm not going to use a bobby pin with earwax on it.  A few weeks later I looked at a bobby pin in the bathroom, sitting on the counter. Also earwax.
