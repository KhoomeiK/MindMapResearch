I don't know you at all. I only know your music. Magical Thinking grew on me really fast, and the whole story it tells, since I started hearing the lyrics more. For perspective: I don't often listen to lyrics. But in this I heard the whole story, since I think it resonates with something I'm going through now. I had taken a vacation with my girlfriend for a few days on our spring break, and on the last day a few hours before the flight back, everything in our state began shutting down for the virus. Students were restricted from returning to their dorms, and the stress began setting in. Two days after we got back, my girlfriend had to go home. We weren't on the best terms because of how stressed we were with how we were getting affected by the shutdowns. Since then, I have remained in a dorm, alone, and she's been at her house, a 4.5 hour drive across the state. We have no way of really seeing each other. Anyway, because of all the circumstances hitting at once on top of the distance between us, we're going through some difficult challenges. It hasn't really been the same ever since everything shut down. And a lot of this album sits very tightly with me, because it sounds very similar to what I am experiencing in my relationship. I just wanted to thank you for creating this work of art. I really wish that I could get to know you as a person and talk. I feel like you'd have a lot of wisdom. I hope that everything in NYC settles down and I can go see your show there safely. 

Thanks again. 
Warm regards,
Jake"

relationship_advice,flltmsq,t1_flls9gf,1585267495.0,"I understand ya there. I think the change in behavior comes from the fact that a) I have nothing to do anymore, life has slowed down a lot. Whereas she has friends at uni, but doesn't really hang out with them outside of study time. Back at her home, she hangs out with her friends there. And b) distance. We've delt before, over holidays and what not. But between the sudden changes, and likelihood we won't see each other again for half a year, It's a new battle that we're dealing with. I've reacted poorly, for sure. I'm not really doing well mentally and I need to find better ways to cope. But it's still something completely different than what were used to.

I see what you're saying in terms of the broader scope of things. I see myself to be an old soul, so I have already gone through drastic changes and at this point am confident with my plans for the future. I have an idea in the back of my head of what I like and don't like in people, and that hasn't changed. Don't think it will, since it aligns with what my values and morals have always been. My interests have changed, but not my moral compass. I can tell you this girl certainly has potential to be apart of my future, and she feels the same way.

At least, if there are problems, if she is changing, she needs to tell me. I can't read hints properly. On several occasions we've been worried we weren't good enough for each other, as we found out, *after* communicating our feelings."

Meanwhile, I am the same way, except I can't go back home because the virus is very bad where I live. So I'm stuck in a dorm, completely alone, with the only human contact I have being GrubHub drivers. I don't have many friends I connect with online. They all moved out by this point since they're in-state. I feel that it's a little more than the usual clingies and low self esteemies.

I'm fighting the anxiety what feels like most of the time, but in the meantime while I work different parts of that (as I've told her) I need to feel secure. 

I don't ask her to tell me everything she's doing. I never asked for her location on snap or anything. I haven't ever previously asked her to send me her messages. While her getting defensive about it is understandable (I can see it from her shoes, my mom was exactly the same way with me as I am with my gf now) it only makes me even more nervous. Like literally just conversations with guys. I even did the same thing for her, since I was raised mostly by mom so I wasn't one of the Bois, and I have a lot of female friends which makes her uncomfortable. I showed her every conversation I've had in the past months with someone of the opposite sex. I've also been trying to give myself more to do and quit obsessing over my phone, since that contributes to my anxiety with this situation as well. I've communicated that to her.

I was making poor judgement out of fear (I have diagnosed social and general anxiety) and took a hard look at myself. It's not that she doesn't respect me, it's that I've never brought things up that are important to me as much as I should have, like how I feel I'm ignored and all. I know she appreciates a lot about me and when I'm swirling in fear from ambiguity I jump to conclusions. I also know that if I continue doing this she will lose respect for me and feel she's wasting her time, since she doesn't feel good enough. 

Tl;dr I will try to prevent myself from obsessing over my phone when I'm in ambiguity and do something (thanks quarantine), while she is going to try to let me know what she's doing rather than just taking off. 

I trust her a lot and I don't think it's in her morals to betray me unless I make her feel worthless. Thanks all for your perspective, it helped me evaluate the situation better and more accurately communicate how I felt."

personalfinance,fbw1dtx,t1_fbvzu2d,1577139130.0,"Totally! What you're saying makes sense, and I would hard limit the biggest categories, and invest the excess. I've caught myself spending the excess before since it was too easily accessible. For me, I understand the graphs a lot more easily. Looking at data makes it easier to understand and gets to my head better than words. 
I actually just thought of using a tool to put my expenses into a spreadsheet, then do my own analysis of my spending in R, so that might work too"
personalfinance,fbvyr6a,t1_fbvxful,1577138031.0,"Well, realistically, I could say that I don't have to spend a dime and I'd save faster. I could do this, but I do live 10 minutes of a bus ride from a city, and go out often with friends. The spending will happen, and I think categorizing what I actually spend on will help me be more aware of what I'm spending on. For example, if my spending was mostly in food, I can stop myself from getting a speciality roll from the sushi place and save myself 50% at the restaurant by opting for a classic roll, and I can completely eliminate my late night on-campus pizza by buying cereal supplies, which will make 3-4 meals for the price of one late night pizza. TLDR I'm very flexible with my spending and can adjust it accordingly, but I know it's not going to be possible for me to cut it all together given my circumstances. 

With 3, this is basically my Robinhood investment account. It takes 3 days to withdraw uninvested funds for spending. 

As for 2, when calculating anything I always round up but I've never done 10% overcompensation. That's a good idea for me to do, I will start doing that."

CommercialAV,fa0aefu,t1_fa08g8g,1575751590.0,It's a loud distorted high mid freq whine. NOT static or white noise. I say screaming because it is comparable to a female screaming.
audioengineering,fa043mn,t3_e4yx3o,1575748683.0,"Question about commercial audio system issue:

I have a Crown 135MA that likely stopped working recently. It was here from the restaurant who had it earlier, and we've been using it for the 3 months we've been here. I'm not sure of how long the previous company was here for, I think it was a few years.

The issue is that when the amp is turned on there is a very loud scream. Not really white noise or static. Unplugging the inputs does not solve the problem, and I'm thinking it's power related because the output volumes do nothing to control it. The issue came up suddenly without loud music or anything in the middle of a shift."

MarioKartTour,f98a899,t3_dfdfc1,1575175811.0,"That and the timing of items. Right as I was in 1st approaching the finish, I had two suddenly appear behind me, a red shell coming towards me, a bullet(whatever it's called), and a blue shell. All at once. I don't feel like they're attacking each other with items. It feels like they collectively make an effort to attack me.

It's very frustrating because it feels like the computer is determining your outcome and driving you towards NOT placing first (the characters celebrate when placing last? Lol?), rather than your ability to drive past people and time items correctly."
