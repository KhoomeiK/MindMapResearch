depression,exkpwbf,t1_exkp6rg,1566396154.0,"yeah and to just immediately disregard people that open up about it is also kind of questionable so it‚Äôs hard to really put the ‚Äúfakes‚Äù and the ‚Äúreal ones‚Äù apart.

i hate that being depressed is almost an aesthetic now to some people. i‚Äôve also talked to some kids that have said hey feel left out because they ‚Äúaren‚Äôt depressed‚Äù when all their friends are. it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous."
depression,exkegpv,t3_ctek8m,1566386616.0,"i don‚Äôt usually read this long a post but for some reason i decided to. and i feel you. being cheery as to not make people around me uncomfortable, having your problems belittled when you let anything slip out. the repetitive words of the countless therapists and counsellors. 

the feeling that i‚Äôm pathetic for being frightened of every little thing. 

i‚Äôm tired of seeming happy. and i don‚Äôt quite believe any of us really are. we all just keep going, trying to grasp onto the fact that maybe it does get better, maybe i‚Äôll be ok.

go to therapy, take your meds, be in a some sort of consistent system you feel a part of and maybe, maybe we can fix you. 

no one‚Äôs happy. that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre a whinny little bitch. you don‚Äôt need your misery validated by others. it‚Äôs real if it‚Äôs real to you. none of us experience anything the same.

sorry i went on a whole rant. i don‚Äôt expect you to read this. i have a habit of thinking whilst writing so i don‚Äôt even know if any of this made sense at all.

with all that aside i do hope the best for you friend."
socialanxiety,exkanua,t3_ctemwe,1566381787.0,"i wouldn‚Äôt say i beat it quite yet but i‚Äôve been doing really well and things that worked for me were to obviously focus on myself and my thoughts more than others and if i start panicking i look around the room and identify each object as specifically as i can: small beige clock, reading 10:55.52, looking a little crooked... of course this will distract you from convos if you‚Äôre in any. when in a convo i also picture sketching the persons face which distracts me from the emotional and social element."
