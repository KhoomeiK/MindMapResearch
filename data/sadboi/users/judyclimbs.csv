Frugal,fr165y6,t1_fqzi9hi,1589813995.0,You are welcome and to your point I think some items have a shipping fee no matter what. If that’s the case I just skip ordering online and I add it to my future in-person trip.
Frugal,fqzxlou,t1_fqzws68,1589777966.0,I’ll be curious to see if that ends up being the case. It’s the same company my bank uses so unless they have a lower quality product they reserve for Costco (which they might)  the quality should be the same. I’ll know in a few weeks.

I like Orgain (chocolate) and I order it from Costco in multiples when they have it on sale. It mixes easily and works as a standalone shake too. 
For liquids use water or any plant or animal milk with the chocolate or probably any fruit juice with vanilla protein powder. 

My shake this am was: half an organic gala apple, couple of pieces of broccoli (stalk and flower) chunk of red cabbage, handful of baby spinach, protein powder, water, big splash of almond milk  I use a nutribullet blender. Makes one serving and it’s easy to clean. Make the drink and consume immediately or prep it the night before in the blender cup with or without the liquid. If you need carbs you can put instant oats. Most whole vitamins can also be dropped into the cup and will blend well. 

I always strive for a color and nutritional balance in my drinks and I rotate what I put in all the time. Only once or twice have I made undrinkable combos. Lol Basically avoid super pungent veg and you’ll be fine. I think nutribullet has recipes on its site if you are nervous about winging it or google blender drink recipes. Carrots, bananas, peeled citrus, celery, cooked sweet potato and similar work well. 

If you need calories you can use calorie dense  foods as additives such as nut butters and/or use whole milk. 

Hope this helps."

As to eating I find blended drinks are easier to get down. Any assortment of fruit and veg, protein powder if you have it or yogurt. Water, almond milk, cow milk etc for the liquid. For whatever reason I find a squirt of lemon or lime juice balances everything out nicely.

Also, I think you are more likely to be injured in a car accident than climbing within your ability. I don’t have a source for that, it just seems right. So unless you are truly on home lockdown and not going to work or the store or wherever, you are probably just as safe, or not, climbing if you aren’t stupid about it. Now, that said, I watched an obviously new outdoor climber take the same unsafe lead fall three times at a sport crag last week. I was just about to suggest he stop doing that when he had his belayer lower him. Somebody somewhere said, “You can’t fix stupid.”
Oh and a last point, living is inherently risky and nobody is getting out alive. I know the point is to not overwhelm medical, ems and SAR personnel but you are going to start having suicide clusters pretty soon if things don’t normalize. Mark my words.

I could see if we were dealing with Ebola or something ghastly like that but the fear mongering associated with this crisis is extreme. Yes, I’ve seen the legit numbers on the worldwide spreadsheets and believe them, but numbers alone don’t tell the whole story. You have to compare apples to apples. 

Also, here are a few fun facts: 23k people on average die annually falling off trains in India. Can’t name my source there but I saw it on a video two years ago that I streamed on Netflix. 59k (mostly under age 15) died in 2015 primarily in Africa and Asia from rabies infection-a horrible way to go. That number is from the CDC and you can read Rabid: A Cultural History of the World’s Most Diabolical Virus to learn more about rabies. My point is: people in developing nations die like flies and we in the developed world don’t know or don’t care. We get a virus here with low CFR for most populations and we drive ourselves to the brink of financial and social collapse in a matter of weeks. I simply don’t understand what is happening.
