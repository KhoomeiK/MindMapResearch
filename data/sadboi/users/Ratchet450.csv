PanicAttack,fo1u75t,t1_fo1ttie,1587441597.0,Yea my reflux is terrible even when I try to do good and take medicine. I'll have a hard time breathing from it and my asthma and then wam panic attack. I used to have attacks where my whole body shakes violently. Like a whole body muscle spasm. But those have seemed to calmed down. But now I have bumps in my mouth that i cant get to go away and those make my anxiety go up. Always something lol ðŸ˜ª
PanicAttack,fo1t4id,t3_g57imt,1587440896.0,Me as well! Had all the cardio work and they think it is muscle tension like really really tight causing the pains. I would also get I'll call them explosions like start in 1 spot and radiated. Those triggered massive panic attacks because I would freak out. Turned out it was caused by bad acid relfux somehow. I'm still working on overcoming the mental side of it.
WalgreensStores,fmb9vrl,t1_fmb962l,1585921929.0,So I guess it really depends on the situation. For me I'm helping other stores because the leadership had self quarantined. But as it gets worse the more nervous I get even though I'm trying to follow guidelines. (Coughing customers drive me nuts) my home store even with a stay at home order is busy and has many of the high risk individuals. I'm young ect but have asthma and scarring on my lungs so that adds to my anxiety.
WalgreensStores,fm9zy8r,t1_fm9zmhj,1585880450.0,Thank you. The reason I was wondering is I know quite a few people are taking 2-3 weeks. But with projections and such I wouldnt want to get to the point where I take leave then end up coming back in the worst part of this lol I'm not saying I will take it because I am helping my store but if people keep acting like they will never get it and come to the store I will look at my options.
WalgreensStores,fldcrj8,t1_fldaftf,1585061829.0,Cant wait to try it tomorrow!
WalgreensStores,fld80zl,t1_fld7z36,1585058794.0,I like that idea! I'm going to make it into a game too.
millionairemakers,fl2qzyd,t3_fm4msu,1584757700.0,School loan will be gone 0.0
PanicAttack,fjypnqe,t3_fff5gh,1583701890.0,"Sure sounds like one to me. Many changes in how you normally are can cause panic attack to those prone. So like for me, I saw some floaties in my eyes, like the strange effect you get if you get blinded by the sun, that change cause my hr to spike and then started shaking/ spasming aka panic attack. I had one quite often with acid reflux. (Still do occasionally) feel chest tightness hr spikes and here we go! Same with just feeling off and when I have something fall asleep like my hand. Acceptance therapy helps with that. It teaches about accepting feelings as you have them. So for me my chest is tight right now because of acid reflux. I'm accepting it and it is not triggering a panic attack. After your surgery you might feel high and just go, o I feel high right now, so glad my surgery is over and just chill instead of it triggering a panic attack."
Anxiety,fi2qo8x,t3_f62g92,1582086353.0,You could try some good books. My favorite and a popular one on this sub is DARE technique for anxiety and panic. It helped curb my anxiety a ton.
PanicAttack,fhnf6cs,t1_fhjrqes,1581725875.0,That's the book I used too. I also have really bad acid reflux. That book was a live saver literally
PanicAttack,fha45qr,t3_f1ye71,1581396702.0,"Yup that's a panic attack! I have had many many but one that reminds me of yours is this. I was working on a school project in google docs. It was a semester long project and we had like 80 pages of stats and graphs and all sorts of stuff. It was getting close to the time for the presentation and I was writing a few more lines for my part and I copied and pasted, by accident I had highlighted the whole document and bam everything was gone. All 80 pages 3 months of group worth gone and I started freaking out and had the same symptoms as you. By the end it turned out they could bring it back but I remember it so vividly. Just try to remember panic attacks feel crazy but cant hurt you :) I had one that made my muscles all over spasm. And another that actually made half my body not work. They have some crazy symptoms!"
PanicAttack,ffqnrks,t1_ffqnous,1580139420.0,Thank you :) I will order the book today!
PanicAttack,ffqb4tx,t3_eul24k,1580128913.0,Same for me 0.0 woke up at 4am today first panic attack in like 2 years. Had them in college 6 years ago as well and thought I conquered them. One thing I am finding through talking to others is to not let your job eat you alive. The company will be there after you go someplace else. I struggle with that because I want my coworkers to respect me and to fit in but I am under a ton of stress and maybe I need to take a step back.
PanicAttack,ffq2xxr,t1_ffq2oq8,1580117496.0,Thank you trying this now
Anxiety,fffhe3c,t3_etbvvw,1579884004.0,Gratssssss!!! Never let anyone tell you your late for anything. It took me awhile to get my license too becuase of anxiety and I would think badly at myself and now longer to get a full time job. I now look at it as ok we all have our own time tables :)
Anxiety,fffh6j4,t3_et1xah,1579883873.0,I also get anxious when it's too quiet ðŸ˜‚
Anxiety,ff2pcst,t1_ff27net,1579517719.0,"Yea ekg they ended up giving me xanex. I had a panic attack that I actually couldn't move my body, half my mouth my hands it was the scariest thing. Turned out they said it was a panic attack but I didnt a heart stress test and saw a cardiologist and had a holter monitor as well. They kept saying anxiety and took me awhile before I stopped checking my pulse reading and slowly got back to normal ish."
Anxiety,ff267ef,t1_ff1n8e4,1579494943.0,I had that as well. I would stay at the local hospital and read a book or walk around there to feel safe. I started constantly checking my pulse a ton. Blood pressure ect. I stopped exercising and it got really bad especially mentally. I found that anxiety allows us to sense sensations that others do not. Like I started noticing my pulse in other parts of my body and thought it was something really bad. Acceptance thearapy really helped me. It taught me to accept the feelings and to even bring it on in some circumstances. It reduces the fear and I was able to get out of the hole I was in. I would check my pulse and if it was high bam panic. I used the DARE panic book as well. It really helps
millionairemakers,fer0xxv,t3_eq81a8,1579348370.0,Ooo
PanicAttack,fduqdcq,t1_fdr1nf0,1578737326.0,Hi me hows it going? Lol I had the same thing and used that book to great effect. My panic attacks are less intense now and it helped alot about going after the panic and accepting them and my heart. Took some time but it helped me immensely.
PanicAttack,fdj0zcr,t3_elkiuj,1578455673.0,"Shaking us to try and reduce the cortisol in your system from the panic attacks. I had them every night for almost a year and for mine it got really intense and violent muscle spasms all over. I also focused on my heart rate and obsessed about it to much. I would also find a doctor to talk to, to get some advice about then especially if they start happening more. If I could treat my panic attacks again I would have looked for treatment earlier before they were really bad."
PanicAttack,fdj0jlv,t3_elk17p,1578455364.0,For me acid reflux. Anything I eat causes it to some extent which would make my chest tight and cause panic. After I learned and understood it was reflux it does not trigger me like it did. I think learning about your trigger and realizing whatever it is wont hurt you will help you overcome panic.
PanicAttack,fdj0br7,t3_ele6fl,1578455214.0,"Also something to keep in mind is he might be really tired the next day. Panic attacks take alot out of you so if he is grouchy or tired, try not to take it personal."
Anxiety,fdgayaz,t1_fdg7vjm,1578387841.0,Thank you :)
Anxiety,fdfv9na,t3_el48hx,1578371135.0,I had to cope through that at my college. I knew where every restroom was and got to every class early to put my stuff down to claim a seat and go use the restroom. I had a fear of that as well and I would not drink anything until I was safely going home. That's how I coped but there must be another way.
PanicAttack,fdftszb,t3_el0qk5,1578370032.0,Something I have found that helps is I use an acupressure mat I bought on Amazon every night. I just lay on it and it takes alot of the anxiety out until I'm ready to go to sleep. It helps me keep my mind off of trying to get to sleep too.
PanicAttack,fdftffn,t1_fdehkrf,1578369756.0,If you have any questions let me know :)
PanicAttack,fdft7zt,t1_fdeh1oi,1578369611.0,Good to know I'm not alone thank you! I have slowly learned to accept it and not focus on it as much. I tell myself it means my Heart is extra strong lol I even have started going to a gym recently. Slowly work in progress but I used to be afraid to even go up stairs since my heart would beat fast!
PanicAttack,fdfsyvf,t1_fddu9j9,1578369434.0,Maybe try some therapy books? Amazon has some good ones that can help. I used the DARE book that really helped me and one called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in 7 weeks that I found helpful.
PanicAttack,fdfsnlb,t3_el3jg6,1578369215.0,"My family didnt have any history of it and what the doctor told me and I felt this way that after every test it would not be enough. I call the feelings ""impending doom"" feelings. What I found was my panic attacks made my muscles so tight I was not only getting neck and back and head pains but my legs were actually spasming too. I could feel my heart , blood going up my neck. It freaked me out so much. Turned out anxiety can make you focus on things that other people never notice. Any questions let me know. Sorry about rambling! But if the doctor says its panic attacks I would try a counselor or read the DARE book at the start."
Anxiety,fdfrtxs,t3_el2581,1578368650.0,Gratsssss!!! One thing I have found with anxiety and panic is that we really are in this together. There is no set time to do things in life. I felt bad about getting my first job at 25(I'm 26 now)  but now I realize we just are having to conquer things others dont even think about.
PanicAttack,fdfrlcg,t3_eky7xw,1578368491.0,"I developed them at guess what age 24 Male as well.  I'm 26 now and for me the first year I had them daily and it  got worse because I didnt know it was panic attacks. I would focus on feelings and such, freak out panic and repeat. It got worse and worse and was the worst year of my life by far. I started going to therapy and he taught me acceptance therapy. How to accept the feelings and panic. I used the book DARE for anxiety and panic which is talked about on this sub pretty often. When you start leaning into the panic instead of away it turns down the intensity and frequency of the attacks. For me I had them like 5-6 times a day which involved shaking all over too for almost a year before I bought into what my therapist and that book was really telling me. I have had maybe 3 in the last year total and they were a 2/10 in intensity where before they were 10/10. If any questions let me know! I consider myself a professional panicker now lol"
PanicAttack,fddclul,t3_ekns5m,1578305784.0,I recommend the book DARE for anxiety and panic. It teaches about acceptance therapy and it is talked about often on this sub. As someone who went through a year with 4-6 panic attacks a day when I tried to avoid them it made me dread them and have  impending doom feeling. Like a 10/10 terrible feeling. When I started therapy for it and read that book I started going towards the panic and through therapy started going towards the panic feeling instead of away and even later on triggering my panic attacks whenever I felt one coming on. I would trigger one before driving to get it out of my system. I now have the attacks maybe once a month instead of multiple times daily and I can trigger one right now and start shaking if I want to. If I resist its 10/10 dread and scared feelings and it is terrible. By going towards it and triggering the attacks as I feel it coming on it became a 2/10 in the terror/intensity department becuase I was no longer resisting the attacks.  Any questions let me know! I'm passionate about panic attacks since it was the worst year I ever had to figure out how to overcome.
PanicAttack,fddc249,t3_ekptii,1578304946.0,It took time but with therapy for me it got better. My attacks would have my whole body spasming. Even my chest muscles. I would be in so much pain and soreness. I would use pain creams
PanicAttack,fddbwj3,t3_ekk6dp,1578304708.0,You got this!!
Anxiety,fddbrd8,t3_ekcam9,1578304491.0,Me too now my doctor says its ashma and acid reflux. Which both triggered panic attacks. I am slowly learning to accept that feeling with therapy and it is making it less likely I have a panic attack from it now. I do have an inhaler in my pocket just in case. Managed to transition from the stronger panic medicine always in my pocket to an inhaler.
PanicAttack,fcje2xa,t3_ehfmhv,1577684361.0,It's ok to vent! We all need to vent here at some point or another. I actually had one of my first panic attacks playing a game. I was playing rocket league and maybe because my heart rate was up so much for so long? I had panic out of nowhere.
PanicAttack,fc7k839,t3_egme5t,1577510093.0,I always wished I tried therapy first but my doctor wanted me to go on anxiety medicine. Now the medication helps me for sure but CBT helped me as well. If you can I would try to find a doctor that can do that treatment and give it a shot. It took some time but it was really effective in reducing my panic attacks and anxiety.
PanicAttack,fc77mp6,t3_egg007,1577499692.0,Exposure helps you get exposed to the symptoms to learn to accept them and in the long run you wont notice them or of you do you will say what ever or like me I went as far as to trigger my panic attacks when ever one was coming on. It makes them significantly less scary and intense. I used the book DARE for anxiety and panic and had a doctor help me with exposure therapy.
PanicAttack,fbn9mos,t3_edzio7,1576994586.0,Sounds similar to what I had except I would feel like I was on fire. I am impressed that you can work out! It took me a year of therapy to be able to work out again because I would always check my pulse and panic. Have you had any therapy for panic? That really helped me.
PanicAttack,fbdfvh8,t1_fbd8pj4,1576760862.0,I'm 26 and developed reflux and it triggerd really bad panic attacks. Through therapy I get the feelings now but dont react to it that much. I can trigger a panic attack any time if I start panicking. I would ask your doctor if there is anyone close to you who helps overcome panic and see if they can also help the reflux. I haven't overcome that part but the choking feeling I feel it doesnt trigger panic now. If you have any questions let me know!
PanicAttack,fbcwgiz,t3_eckwaz,1576736278.0,I had so much pain from the shaking/spasms. I would use all sorts of pain rubs and lotions. I would get pains in my head which would cause more panic and make my muscles tighter and repeat. I even had my neck x rayed and the doctor said it was the tightest muscles he had ever seen. I ended up going to physical therapy which helped immensely to loosen up the muscles. Acceptance therapy really helped me to not fear my panic attacks as much and since I wasn't fighting back the intensity of them went down from like 10/10s to like a 5/10
PanicAttack,fbcvjdg,t3_eclk8s,1576735321.0,Have you tried any therapy? I learned acceptance therapy and over time would even trigger my panic attacks. I would beat them to the punch so to speak. I start having one. Eyes dilating heart rate sky rockets and body starts shaking. I starting shaking myself and saying bring it on panic is that all you got! And that was what I learned with my doctor and it really helped. I used a book called DARE for anxiety and panic.
PanicAttack,fbcvb75,t3_ecmfym,1576735090.0,Do you have acid reflux at all or ashma? I know those both effected me and triggered my panic attacks. I had to find a doctor and learn to accept my heart rate increasing. It has helped me a ton
WalgreensStores,fano9sn,t1_fano3o5,1576246481.0,Thank you for letting me know! Ours has been down about 12 days so far. Its just frustrating becuase of so many photo orders we have to ring up at a different one.
WalgreensStores,fanne9s,t1_fann6hs,1576245801.0,Did they fix it the same day? or had to wait for parts
PanicAttack,f9y1udq,t3_e7cg3g,1575722039.0,Breathing is automatic no matter what we try to do :)
Anxiety,f9tvbsc,t1_f9t6cyy,1575639404.0,From what my therapist said it is the most effective treatment out right now. It helped me for sure. It taught me to go after the panic and made them much less scary.
Anxiety,f9t5l1v,t3_e6to0h,1575609540.0,Depends on the dose and frequency. Like I took          .25mg 1 or 2 times a day for panic. And after a couple months it stopped being effective for me so I could either go up but I found exposure therapy and worked back down.
Anxiety,f9t5dye,t3_e6r9p7,1575609352.0,I had one a year ago where I couldn't move at all like literally paralyzed. Was rushed to hospital and it turned out to be panic. It can cause some crazy symptoms!
Anxiety,f9t578b,t3_e6q907,1575609178.0,"I was going to day the same thing. I think a mindfulness app or book would really help with that. (I used headspace) and it really helps you to accept thoughts, processes ect then you stop noticing them."
PanicAttack,f9t4znd,t3_e6s86s,1575608979.0,"Hi like 2 years ago I started getting panic attacks and would get 3-5 a day. Would shake all over so many symptoms was really bad. It was hurting my mental health tremendously and I couldn't excersize for fear of my heart. I started exposure therapy and was also reading a really good book called DARE for anxiety and panic. I slowly changed my attitude from fear of the panic attack to bring it on. So I started shaking myself when I felt one coming on. I would trigger it and be like come on body is that all you got!! Through the therapy and bringing it on I went from daily attacks to once a month to about maybe 3 the last year. But once you get the fear of it out a 10/10 attack becomes a 3/10. I dont have my panic medicine in my pocket anymore and I don't check my pulse as often as I did. I credit going after the panic for helping so so much. Like right now if I felt one coming on instead of fighting it I start shaking my arms and go let's do this! And it helps it be less scary, intense and goes away quicker. :)"
Anxiety,f9n2oaj,t3_e5zco5,1575475694.0,I had this and then a strange thing made me overcome it. I bought a nintendo switch and it came broken. So I called and ended up having to call them multiple times over the next weeks because they kept forgetting to send me a new one. By the end of it I didnt have as much fear of phone calls lol
PanicAttack,f989xq7,t3_e47vtw,1575175710.0,Sounds like a similar thing I went through except I didnt have one but kept triggering symptoms. It really wears on you as you know.  I highly recommend reading the book DARE for anxiety and panic and seeing if you can find a doctor who specializes in panic. I worked with one and it was a God send for sure. I was in the worst place of my life mentally and was so tight I would get muscle spasms and pain all the time. Which compounded it. I think the acceptance therapy and going after what you fear would really help you. Any questions let me know!
PanicAttack,f98922g,t3_e44798,1575175396.0,I have learned that people with anxiety can focus on things that other people might never ever pay attention to. I focused on my heart and it beating and could not stop. It literally was driving me insane. I thought something was wrong so go to the doctor freak out get muscle tension and pain and repeat. I went to a therapist who did acceptance therapy with me. I used a book called DARE for panic attacks and anxiety and it really helped. Once I transitioned to my heart beating is actually telling me it is strong and started my first full time job I was able to get out of the loop.
PanicAttack,f988851,t3_e485ut,1575175107.0,The book DARE for panic and anxiety would help :) I used it and therapy to help me overcome the same exact thing as you. I focused on it and it snowballed then developed tons of muscle tightness because I was tense all the time so it led to more pain. I actually went to physical therapy and that helped me as well. Through all of this I learned to accept it and I stopped noticing my heart. It can be done and you can do it!!! I didnt think I could and those were the lowest times in my live but did make it through. Any questions let me know.
PanicAttack,f6y6wjd,t3_dti6ng,1573269529.0,"GAD(generalized anxiety disorder) is known to change its shape sometimes. I had it and got really bad ocd, for like 2 years then now no ocd but panic attacks the last year what I found is we can focus on things and experience it in a new way like I never noticed my finger and now I can feel the blood in it all the time. Those sensations freaked me out and caused panic attacks. Heart rate ect. I had to use therapy, medication and a few books. DARE- book for anxiety and panic was the best one. And fight through those attacks to get better. I had about 5 attacks a day at my worst. But now I'm about once or twice a month. And they are like 2/10 in intensity compared to the 10/10 ones I used to get."
Anxiety,f6qunmh,t1_f6obimx,1573086359.0,Yea for sure. I caused lots of my own side effects and it actually caused some of my panic attacks lol because I  freaked out about it.
PanicAttack,f6qufn9,t3_dsordf,1573086196.0,Mental help sounds like it could be really helpful for you! I had a counselor help me through my panic attacks and I couldn't have done it without him. Maybe see if they recommend anxiety medicine? I tried to not take it but I'm much calmer now that I am on it.
PanicAttack,f6o030k,t1_f6nzoik,1573004397.0,Occasionally it does. I use a book called DARE for anxiety and Panic. I highly recommend it.
Anxiety,f6nz2w5,t3_ds6k1d,1573003664.0,"I had it really bad as well. Through therapy I  was taught acceptance of my pulse , heartbeat and challenged to do pushups and take the stairs. Took me awhile but about a year through it I dont check my pulse anymore with a machine. I do with my hand still though. I try to challenge my heart to see how high it can go and bring it on! I have to use this to keep overcoming my fear."
PanicAttack,f6nylr2,t3_ds5958,1573003319.0,I think it could be. I have something similar. It happens most of the time for me at night when I'm trying to get to sleep or if I have an off day and have nothing to do. I have bad ear ringing and then my heart starts to pound fast and I get this feeling of something is wrong and it triggers a panic attack. I try to put some music on or try to say bring it on! Since I have gotten through it before.
Anxiety,f6m35q7,t3_dru1p0,1572965896.0,Just make sure you talk to your doctor about any side effects. They are common when starting anxiety medicine so dont freak out. I had headaches and stopped after a week then went on a different medicine and still had them and stuck with it and my anxiety is so much less I am glad I did. They go away after your body gets used to the medicine
PanicAttack,f6bay8k,t1_f69sxs0,1572771206.0,I'm on sertraline and got through the early side effects and will most likely take it for as long as I can. I used to get this impending doom feeling (hard to describe) but that has gone away on the medicine. My biggest side effect was headaches. Thet went away after like a month on the medicine maybe 2 months. I took xanax as my panic emergency medicine and it helped with therapy getting over it but I could tell the low dose wasnt working for me any more and I stopped using it since it is a powerful drug.
PanicAttack,f69rpzx,t3_dqthli,1572746208.0,"I had/have it and did the tests ER ect. What it ended up being for me is acid reflux and really bad muscle tightness. I mean so bad that my hamstrings were spasming and freaking me out. I thought blood clots... but that tightness led to some really bad neck head and chest pain. I had an mri and the doctor told me my muscles were so tight in my neck from panic and stress you couldn't even see some kind of bulge that everyone has. I basically went to therapy for it did tons of stretching, heat and the like seemed to help."
PanicAttack,f5joxja,t3_dnw1vd,1572235019.0,"I had exactly this. Night time then 3 am then panic attack then whole body shakes / spasms everywhere. I actually got tested for different nerve things and it turned out it was my panic attack. I had (still kind of) heart anxiety but turned out to be acid reflux. Anyway I would notice my heart and I would have a panic attack. Legs started shaking then everything violently. Only after therapy , reading the DARE anxiety and panic book and leaning into my panic attacks did I start to overcome it. I would trigger the spasms my self like start shaking my legs and beat the panic to the punch so to speak and it helped me overcome them."
Anxiety,f3q9wo7,t1_f3p0s4f,1571071736.0,Mine was excersize. I stopped because I feared my heart rate. Didnt do any thing. Stairs scared me but I finally got a gym membership and even started getting my heart rate up :D
Anxiety,f3q9pfs,t1_f3pbgw5,1571071659.0,I was too took like 5 before I found one :/. The Dare anxiety and panic book might help you. Helps you bring it on and makes a 10 panic like a 5.
Anxiety,f3m8djj,t1_f3m6b8u,1570984566.0,Maybe can get a regular anxiety medicine like sertraline?
Anxiety,f3m61bh,t1_f3ld7vu,1570983586.0,Same. I needed .25 small dose xanax and therapy to get through my panic. It was when the .25 wasn't having the same effect that I knew I had to get off it.
Anxiety,f3m522g,t3_dh8msr,1570983172.0,That's amazing! So glad you did it!!!!!
PanicAttack,f3m4v9e,t3_dh3y76,1570983091.0,Me either:0
Anxiety,f1sipot,t3_danz9p,1569729425.0,So glad to hear!!!! :D
Anxiety,f1ocixc,t3_daal8l,1569640862.0,My first thought is maybe find a video on YouTube that can explain it well for them. Now you have me really thinking about how to explain it to someone that doesnt have it. It's a lot harder than I thought. I have it and panic attacks but to describe it I would say my brain is worried and it causes physical symptoms like shaking short breath. And can get so bad its debilitating.
Anxiety,f1ckqp1,t3_d8rq3k,1569359623.0,I had the same thing and I know it will sound crazy but I bought a nintendo switch and it came broke so I had to call. No one was helpful and I had to keep calling and calling. They didn't ship me the correct one and forgot the games so more calls. 3 weeks later I no longer feared phone calls lol all becuase of that
PanicAttack,f1a5stb,t3_d8d9tg,1569285836.0,"If it's really bad. I have lots of shaking. And end up resting, I put anxiety calming music on like youtube, I use a good amount of pain creams because I would be so sore. And lots of rest."
Anxiety,ezhlaa2,t3_d14huw,1567912022.0,I second this. Even when no one is around I have one in my ear and one out lol
PanicAttack,eyjk3r3,t3_cx40h1,1567120961.0,You could work through the DARE panic and anxiety book. It really helped me with panic. I did have a good counselor but I felt like that book helped me a ton.
PanicAttack,eyfebw0,t1_eyfcvm7,1567047497.0,"I had holter, stress test and all normal, had a pulse monitor in my pocket with my panic medicine, yea I get exactly that strange air stale hot flash, then it escalates and I spasm all over 0.0 I'm 26 m now and have had them for about 1.5yrs dang I cant believe it's been that long lol I used therapy from a panic anxiety doctor and a book (DARE anxiety panic book) to help get through it. I actually had an attack like that 2 days ago and it was my first one in like 8 months. I got up and said I'm ok and started doing pushups and telling the panic to bring it on!"
PanicAttack,eyfc2e9,t3_cwspsr,1567046518.0,"Yes exactly this I would check my pulse.. freak out blood pressure and led to bad health anxiety and panic attacks, I stopped exercising because was afraid of my heart. And likewise I would wake up at night heart rate would go up I would check it would go up more freak out get a panic attack lots of body spasms and not fun stuff..took a lot of therapy to mostly get over it. Hope it helps to know you are not the only one! Any questions let me know:)"
PanicAttack,ey4t7ob,t1_exvt2r8,1566806781.0,Its 4 am where I am right now and am having one. Doing push ups and saying bring it on to the panic. Will see how it goes. Ears ringing and heart rate is up significantly. Chest tight.
PanicAttack,exvty14,t1_exvt2r8,1566606576.0,"I bought it on Amazon but maybe a local book store would have it? It talks about challenging the panic. I was waking up with it almost every night for 2-3months. I would pet a dog, take panic medicine, wake up my mom. Then learned how to challenge it. Bring it on attitude"
PanicAttack,exvg2el,t3_cuk5wh,1566599114.0,"I had the exact thing same symptoms time , medication, holter monitor ect. I did stress test too. I did cortisol test and it did spike at like 3am. Do you get ringing in your ears at all? I used the DARE book for anxiety and panic and therapy with a panic doctor to help me get through it l, accept it. I still have my panic medication on hand but I haven't used one in many months now."
PanicAttack,exvf58e,t3_cufuds,1566598530.0,Maybe a sleep study would help? They record all sorts of metrics on you over a night time some even allow you to be at your house. I did one at a location for my panic attacks. I didnt have anything wrong but they did say I have terrible sleep habits...
PanicAttack,exveuj0,t3_cuicnc,1566598339.0,"Sounds similar to my panic attacks. Are you on any anxiety medicine? That helped me get to feel better. That and some therapy. The strange feelings, loss of motivation , heart pounding is exactly what I had and still to some extent have."
PanicAttack,evu1k9b,t1_evs2ea0,1564783385.0,Yea that's what I feel too! I actually took CBD and thought I was having a reaction and had a panic attack lol. Most likely it wasnt anything but I felt like I was allergic or something.
PanicAttack,evnt70b,t3_cka1dq,1564631798.0,"I recommend the DARE panic book and seeing a person who specializes in panic if you can. I had a doctor who wanted me to trigger a panic attack in his office. It was an excersize but I said no that's crazy. Finally I tried it and with that book I learned to trigger the panic attacks myself. And have a bring it on attitude. Mine involves a ton of shaking, / muscle spasms. So I would feel one come on and start at a 1 or 2 and then I would trigger it and shake and would tell myself this is fun or bring it on or random things like that. Over time I became less scared of them and the frequency dropped dramatically. I had them 5-7 times a day for at least a month and now maybe 1 a month. But if I feel it coming on, chest tightness, fever, shaking ect. I try to invite the panic. (Which is what I learned at the doctor.)"
PanicAttack,evkqdc3,t3_ck2u9k,1564585038.0,I had one and went to the emergency room. I couldn't move well and half of my mouth wouldnt work. It had something to do with my breathing and they called it an autonomic nervous system hickup. Told me it was rare and I should feel special...... I tried to deep breath too fast.
PanicAttack,evihfpa,t1_evgs022,1564542706.0,Your welcome! You too. Palpitations still trigger my panic but I try to ignore those or say my heart is really excited today. Lol I started eating healthy ish to try and take some of that fear out of it. My doctors kept saying anxiety and you should get over it but it turned out my body actually had fought off lyme disease. Part of my wonders if that caused some of my symptoms. I did have a rare panic attack that made it so I couldn't move my body half my mouth. It was literally paralyzing and the doctor at the hospital thought it was cool because it was so rare <.< lol
PanicAttack,evfbt9k,t1_eve98z4,1564492933.0,Basically for me cortisol is supposed to spike at 6am to help you wake up but mine was spiking at 3am causing a panic attack. Now I thought it was a gland or something wrong but this was after graduating college and I was doing nothing looking for a job. Developed really bad acid reflux overnight. No idea why. And I started worring about my heart and had chest pressure which I still have. Did lots of heart tests and the such and they kept telling me its anxiety but I didnt believe them. I actually struggled to just walk up stairs becuase I could feel my heart and freak out. The panic doctor wanted me to trigger it. Basically it would come on and I would freak out get light headed ect. And it would get to a 10/10 my body would spasm and shake all over. Not fun.. then when I was learning how to trigger it myself. I would feel one come on and I would start shaking myself and squeezing my chest for tightness and saying bring it on! Is that all you got! Lol this feels great. Stuff like that. And it became a 6/10 in intensity. That was the worst year of my life by far. I would have an attack like 6 times a day or more. I have had maybe 2 in the last month. And I'll be like o good buddy panic your back. It's been awhile. I have missed you. Lol if you have any questions let me know. I have read quite a few books and learned a ton trying to survive through that.
PanicAttack,eve8aj7,t1_eve7vrk,1564458543.0,"Well I read that cortisol spikes at a certain time at night and raises until you wake up. I did a cortisol test and the level in my system at 3am was supposed to be what I have at 6am. So i would wake at 3am from the cortisol and have a panic attack, shaking, heart palpitations, scary stuff. I did go to the hospital once becuase I couldn't move my hands or half my mouth. It turned out to be a rare panic symptom. Also acid reflux triggers mine. I got over them by reading the book DARE for panic attacks. It makes them significantly less scary but I also needed a counselor to help me. He taught me to trigger them myself. It helped me be more in charge when one was coming on."
PanicAttack,eve7h58,t3_cjlzf4,1564457820.0,"Is there a time it normally happens? I have gotten through it but had them every night for a couple months. I also had ear ringing, body shaking and spasms."
PanicAttack,eumv69m,t3_cgjh1f,1563920800.0,I would get it checked out they might say its anxiety palpitations. I get it all the time (26m) and it triggered the start of my panic attacks like 1.5 years ago. It still freaks me out sometimes but thearapy has helped and getting my first job has kept my mind of it pretty much.
PanicAttack,eumuq3l,t3_cgl0q6,1563920645.0,I have not had dejavu with mine but the face feeling tingling sounds like panic. Heart rate and headaches are what I get with mine. I'm trying to think if I had any deja vu
PanicAttack,etuzt4h,t3_cdmyxe,1563223317.0,"For me I would say 45min - 1 hr. I used to have days were it would be lots of panic attacks during the day and it felt like it would last 10 hrs. Medication, getting my first job ,and about 8 months of CBT therapy has helped me get over the worst of it."
PanicAttack,et8yi9z,t3_caeou4,1562576849.0,"I had those exact moments. I called it the devils claws lol. I went to the ER because of the slurred speech thing. Have you read the DARE anxiety and panic book? It really helped me get through it. Also a huge help for me was going to physical therapy. They worked on my muscles and helped loosen them up from all the spasms. I cant recommend it enough. Also if it feels like your legs are ""gurgling"" it's actually the hamstring spasming. I fought it so much mentally it almost took me down but got through it. You can too!  If you have any questions let me know:)"
PanicAttack,es810jp,t1_es4ru8i,1561685276.0,Yea that's what I have too. Had one today actually. I have acid reflux and asthma. Having an inhaler with me seems to help.
PanicAttack,es2y9on,t3_c5o03o,1561546740.0,Sounds like one to me. I have breathing/chest pains and it triggered panic attacks. I got them from having bad anxiety. Do they start when you notice something and get worse?
PanicAttack,erzf3mb,t3_c4rr0b,1561433871.0,"Palpitations. Its gotten better but before a palpitation was instant panic attack. Heart rate up, chest pressure, scared and tingles all over. O and lots of shaking and or spasms. Acid reflux caused the same thing."
PanicAttack,erysu1m,t3_c4tmy6,1561416535.0,When I felt one coming on I went and grabbed a drink and honestly chugged it down and tried to breadth. Also the DARE technique helped.
