depression,fbf54l1,t3_eczhm3,1576801799.0,"As you are in therapy, i suggest first and foremost discussing it there, whether it's a group or facilitator. 

From what you've written, it sounds as though your family is actively hindering your treatment by dismissing and minimizing its significance. I would even guess that they are a source or trigger for many of your mental health struggles. 

If you feel bold enough, you might counter frame it. ""It would ruin MY Christmas to not be able to support my friend."" Your wants and needs are valid, and your friend sounds like they are a more significant part of your support network than your blood family. 

Whatever you choose, though, it's okay! You don't need to compromise your mental and emotional health for anyone, as long as you are practicing the best methods of self care that you are able to at any given moment. You can't always please your family, but you also can't always endure their scorn. Either way, you are still important and loved, even if it's just by a bunch of strangers on the internet."

borderlands3,f50k2rq,t1_f5078om,1571928632.0,"That is certainly one perspective. But there are other reports of loot drop imbalance in multiplayer. Admittedly i didn't really understand your first statement in regards to variance. That said, while you may not have had the same experience, and while you may have a specific way of thinking about a situation, those don't really permit empirical statements. The game still has bugs and glitches, and while it's possible that you are correct, that it's just chance, it's also possible that luck and loot chance gets applied alphabetically by username, some classes have higher base luck, or some equally bizarre situation. 

You'll believe what you'll believe, but I'm actively trying to gather information. Again, thanks for your input."

borderlands3,f502lba,t1_f4z2ixz,1571920725.0,"Variance would be sometimes person A gets a legendary, sometimes person B, and sometimes person C, assuming a BALANCED variance. But what is happening is person C gets legendary, persons A and B get white, green, and blue. Every time. 

You can have mechanically imbalanced variance, and again, I'm simply asking if others have experienced this. The statistical likelihood that it has just been ""bad luck"" over the course of almost 30 levels for two of us, and ""exceptionally good luck"" for only one specific party member, the same party member regardless of whether they are 'player two' or 'player three', is so improbable that it leads us to question the mechanics."

We all share to keep the group up to snuff with decent gear though, which helps us survive to get more legendaries, and we can grind the rest for cash. 

I was just curious if anyone else experienced this. It seems odd that the loot drops are that consistently imbalanced, regardless of game mode."
