I am sorry you had to go through that,  I definitely feel more motivated by reading this, thank you for your encouraging words, I wrote this post last night and just woke up to your comment, you're making it feel a little less impossible for me!

I hope you are doing well during these crazy times, and thank you again!"
EdAnonymousAdults,fompsbw,t1_fomp15x,1587899395.0,"I literally have no idea, if I only knew! Maybe to feel less alone somehow?"
EdAnonymousAdults,fompkmj,t1_folt403,1587899150.0,"Haha I can totally relate! I am sorry that you relapsed though, just know that you're not alone in this! I hope you are safe and well! Thanks for making me feel a little more sane"
EdAnonymousAdults,fomoxxp,t1_folkff6,1587898448.0,"Thanks for the sweet reply! I honestly didn't expect so many people to relate, it's making me feel a bit more sane! I hope you are safe and well!"
EdAnonymousAdults,fomosej,t1_fomhrhs,1587898274.0,"Wow, that didn't even cross my mind, it's crazy to realize that my brain doesn't even think of that possibility!   
Thank god I don't really watch runways, who knows how many hours I would spend on that! Thanks for the reply and making me a feel a little less crazy, I hope you are safe and well!"
EdAnonymousAdults,fol6la1,t3_g7y7sb,1587855888.0,"omg! I thought I was alone in this! For me its not so much once a month, I sort of plan my ""cheat days"" together with for example my girlfriend coming over for the weekend, or upcoming events that would require me having to go to a restaurant anyways which I think kind of stems from trying to keep suspicions low. I guess my way of thinking is if I'm going to allow myself to indulge in all this food, might as well do it in front of as many people as possible to get them off my back and show ""LOOK I CAN EAT NORMALLY"".  


I also often feel like this makes my eating disorder less valid because I can do this, but then again, I feel like the reason behind this is ultimately ""protecting"" my eating disorder because the lower I keep the suspicions, and comments, the more I can continue in my behaviors I guess?   


Maybe this ""normal"" unhealthy eating day of yours stems from a similar idea?"
EdAnonymousAdults,fnf44is,t3_g16w7o,1586901055.0,"Yeah same here, I sometimes even watch competitive eaters eat the entire mcdonalds menu or every domino's pizza on the menu lol no idea why though, it only makes me crave it all more!"
EatingDisorders,fljz33x,t3_fpb1yc,1585230323.0,"Hypoglycemia can be a serious side effect. I suggest if you look up the symptoms and if you feel like that could be the case you maybe contact a doctor, it can be really dangerous! I suggest eating some fruit if you are feeling this way, (same goes for the fainting). Berries for example are pretty low in calories and the sugar in them will help get up your sugar levels, which I  suspect are the issue in your case.. Ofcourse I am by no means a doctor! These are just my thoughts, based on my experiences, please be careful! Take care of yourself x"
EatingDisorders,flarrxx,t3_fnnjn3,1584989816.0,"Same here too, I've had an ed for 9 years and am now 23, I too in the past 2 years have been not really actively in recovery but have been doing in general a lot better at not engaging with these thoughts and behaviors. However over these 2 years I had gained some weight, and for some reason I thought it was a good idea to try and lose some of that weight ""the healthy way"". I thought for sure by now after 2 years of doing okay I would be able to do that. 2 months and an insane amount of weight loss later here we are back in the same boat as when I was a teenager, and I feel ridiculous. I guess we both have to accept that after all these years we will have to completely give up our ed, and it doesn't have to be a part of our identity anymore.. wish you all the best"
