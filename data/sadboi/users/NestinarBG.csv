Advice,foxwdny,t1_foxhgq0,1588158546.0,"Yeah, it is is, but IMO a normal 13 year old wouldn't have sex at all. At that age she should have known how babies are made, STDs and she is generally too young for this stuff. I'm sorry, but I can't have sympathy in this situation. Obviously her parents should have done a way better job at raising her too, the mum seems nuts to me, but still - what one does to themselves, no one else can do to them"

&#x200B;

1. DUST DUST DUST - If you want to display your PC like that, I would look into bying some transparent plastic (or even glass if you are handy) and making a cover for all this. Wipe your table today and look at it tomorrow - there will be dust again, so imagine what's gonna happen all over your parts when there are people passing by and fans blowing dust everywhere..  


&#x200B;

2. Does the positioning on the left fan not irk you? x) Show off that Corsair logo properly!  


&#x200B;

3. Why is your SSD upside down..? I have a CM Trooper SE case, where I have 4 plates for SSDs to be installed in plain view when looking at the case from the side of the glass panel. When I bought my SSD, it turned out that in order to mount it on one of these plates, I'd have to have it upside down.. Na-ah. Not happening, so now it's in the back with my HDD.

&#x200B;

4. Cable management - Oh boy.. Give you an idea if the cables are troublesome   
a) Drill pairs of small holes in the wood and use zip ties to bind them in an organised way.   
b) Drill holes large enough for the cables and have them go around the back."

depression,fnj377z,t3_g22e9z,1586991107.0,"I feel you, man. I used to be exactly as you are a few years back, always the odd one out, an outsider, depressed and sad all the time. Over a year ago I went into some deep ass depression when I was -really- considering ending it all as well, I was quite close a few times, because there was a high bridge next to my place and it was known that many people had died there for these exact reasons. The only thing that stopped me was a small tattoo I have on my wrist, which says ""family"". Every time I thought about cutting myself or jumping, I'd look at it and it was the only thing that stopped me, because the pain would end for you, but we are social beings and the pain of the people, who loved you will stay and torment them, because they will wonder what they did wrong to take you to such extremes. Don't do it, it's not worth it. I don't know if you've watched Game of Thrones, but there is a quote from it that I really like.. DEATH IS SO FINAL, WHILE LIFE IS FULL OF POSSIBILITIES. Remember that and repeat it to yourself, you will see it's true. Most of my friends are also people I met online, but that does not mean they are not your IRL friends. They are real people, who care about you and you can talk to them about that stuff. It helps to have a listener. I'm saying all this from experience, perhaps consider therapy and medication as well. It helped me a great deal, because when you go to speak to your therapist and they ask you what is bothering you and you start trying to put it into words, you realize that most of the time it sounds ridiculous and little by little you will learn to feel better about yourself. Trust me, friend, you are not alone. I'm here if you need someone to vent to, I will listen and try to help you."

AmItheAsshole,fnbnsb4,t3_g0ti6u,1586818849.0,"YTA. Your GF seems to actually have a plan for her future and there is a saying that goes ""Don't save what you have left after spending, spend what you have after saving"". If she is able to live comfortably with 500 a month in the UK (judging by the fact that the currency is in pounds), then why should she not save what she has left? The fact that she is a highschool dropout, but is currently studying to make up is in itself proof that she is very far from stupid. I've lived in the UK for 3 years and while I had to pay rent, I could still save 500-700 a month when I got about 1200 altogether.   


What the fuck does ""I work and I can't save"" mean?? Do you think you'd be able to save more if you don't work? What even is working for?? To earn money! Money that you don't need to spend on booze and leisure, but you could SAVE, so you can ensure a better future for yourself. But nah, you brits are just utter shit at saving money, because hey, lager.  


(Void last sentence if you are not british)

A wedding is for the future, your best friend is happy and is building a family.

I'm not any kind of wedding person, I bloody hate weddings, but I would choose the wedding over the funeral for sure, because this is an important moment in your friend's life and he would probably appreciate it greatly if you were there for him. I get it, GF's dad died, it's shit and no one can do anything about it. But it's no reason to treat you like shit, then give you the silent treatment.
