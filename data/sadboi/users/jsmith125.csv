jeffreestarcosmetics,f4jrfdr,t1_f4j75e6,1571624890.0,Thank you! I'm not the best at makeup by any means and love critique on my own face. So when I see someone else asking I just try to give the best advice I can without trying to come off any negative way. Learning is key and honest advice is helpful if taken in the right direction. And everything isn't going to be flawless all the time. I have messed up makeup so much some days I just wipe it all off and go bareface. But the advice I have been given and what I've learned from hours of videos and tutorials has definitely helped guide me in the right direction. Just trying to extend the same to anyone who is seeking it :)
jeffreestarcosmetics,f4jqqa4,t1_f4jf5hm,1571624519.0,"Thanks for the response and not being upset with me lol. You never know how people on Reddit will react. And I could tell photo quality wasn't the best and as someone who wears glasses too, I know they can distort things in pictures and in real life, especially makeup. Lighting too. And I didn't bring up the foundation tone because lighting makes a huge difference and pictures can distort color so much depending on lighting, angle, shadows, megapixels, ECT. Honestly my foundation has started not matching because it's my summer shade but I don't want to waste 30$ foundation! And I also don't show much of my skin so I get where you are coming from 100%. Like you said, you're learning! And that's great. Definitely better to teach yourself than pay someone else and feel helpless when you want to do your own makeup! :) and no matter how much you learn there is always something new to learn with makeup lol. 

You said you used four colors from the pallette, and because of the color scheme. Maybe just brighter blues to combat the darkness of black next time? But I also see your hair is a great shade of navy blue which leads me to believe that's the shade of blue you were using in your color scheme for the reception. Really, it all boils down to personal preference and comfortability. And it's absolutely okay to go for different looks!! Practice and experience make (close to) perfect (cause there is no such thing!). If I were you I would keep posting and keep doing your makeup and experimenting. You definitely have more confidence than me, I'm too scared to post any of my makeup looks lol. Again congrats and I am totally jealous you have the Blue Bloods palette! I can't bring myself to spend that much on a pallette but when the Shane Dawson one drops I'm gonna say to hell with it and get it."
BadMUAs,f4jmqtb,t3_dkppuo,1571622365.0,I actually think this is really pretty and well done for the right event/outfit/setting. Y'all are harsh on here

If I'm wrong please show me but if not.... Give her a break. We've all been there more than once I'm sure. I still have my shitty eyeshadow days.
jeffreestarcosmetics,f4j2q4d,t3_dkm4nl,1571612405.0,"I'm gonna get downvoted to hell for this but I want to give honest advice since that is what you're asking for. 

The color selection is pretty, however with the given picture (unsure if it is the glasses or just picture quality) it looks very blurry/muddy. I can't exactly tell what shades are used as they kind of looked all mixed together. But I would definitely not take the eyeshadow all the way up to your brow, especially in a blue tone. With your warm skin it kind of drains the color around your eyes. Maybe a cut crease or a smokey eye with a pop of blue in the inner corners? And then right under your brows a nice neutral transition shade, close to your skin tone. If you want something a bit more dramatic pop a highlighter on your brow bone after this. But with black and blue color scheme (personally) I would draw the attention to your eyes and not bring the shadow up so much. A liner might look nice with this too and if you're up for it, a winged liner. I like watching RawKristiBeauty for eyeshadow how-to's, she does a great cut crease and has tons of videos to give examples. Chrisspy has a great winged liner tutorial video that helped me tons with my wings. 

Secondly it would help to fill in your brows. Take this with a grain of salt, some people do their brows with their makeup and others don't. I have been both. In my experience however I've found that having your brows done while wearing a full face brings the look together much better. If it's just simple mascara and gloss it's not necessary at all. But for your look even brushing some shadow through them that matches your brows would change this look 100%. I'm still figuring out the brows thing myself, and even with the holy grail (Anastasia Dipbrow) I struggle most days getting them to look even, filled in, and not super heavy after doing so. Definitely something that takes time to learn. 

Lastly the lip color. It's a great color on you, but it kind of clashes with the color scheme you're going for. If it was a nude eyeshadow, Coral would be great, it's definitely suitable on you. But with such dramatic eyes I would go with a nude brown or pinky shade, or maybe just some shimmery gloss to keep the focus on your eyes. I always try to keep one rule of thumb when I'm doing my makeup - only one thing needs to be dramatic unless you're going for a super dramatic over the top look. So, make the eyes your statement on your face and keep the lips simple, or vice versa. It draws attention to one place instead of having it all over the place and being overwhelming. My favorite is completely natural looking makeup with a super bold lip. But now I'm getting off topic haha.

Anyways, please don't take any of this as bashing what you've done, I am whole-heartedly just trying to give you some good advice so you feel more prepared for your wedding reception. I hope it helps, and wish you the best of luck. Congratulations by the way!! If you wanna ask me anything else or need clarification on anything feel free. If you're packing Blue Blood tho you definitely already have great quality taste in makeup to work with. Best wishes!!"

beauty,exzf5fq,t1_exyd675,1566665131.0,"I just started using primer again after being lazy with my makeup for awhile. It definitely does help. The primer gives a better base for the makeup to stick to; some primers fill pores, smooth skin, moisturize, or brighten. All of these things can help the foundation look better on the skin and stay on longer. 

I have huge pores on my nose so my favorite primer for my T zone is Benefit Porefessional primer. It's great. For the rest of my face I use Elf Poreless Putty Primer. My foundation lasts longer and I sweat a lot during work. Products work differently on everyone though so you have to find something that works for you. Sometimes a nice moisturizer is all some people use for primer. 

Hope this helps!"

Man feels obligated/sees nothing wrong with going on a trip/business thing/out of town ALONE with the woman.

I know my dad is proud of me, and always has been, but he didn't always use his words when I was younger. This really impacted me."
MentalHealthSupport,es75tgv,t1_es742hz,1561664399.0,"Okay good. Read your other comment too. Just try to come to terms with the fact you are human and will make mistakes. Probably forever, no matter how old you get. I've accepted this so every ""fuck up"" I have now is just me having to accept a mistake and lesson learned. You can't be perfect. You can only be the best at being you. Sorry if I sound like a dumb motivational poster, but it is true. Don't be so hard on yourself please. :)"
MentalHealthSupport,es6zxch,t3_c67bwf,1561660962.0,"I hope this comment finds you. You definitely are seeing things much worse than they are, but that isn't a fault. You're very ill (which you have stated) so feeling like you are is natural in your state. I'm sorry things seem so bad. Maybe we can try a new perspective on things? 

Your ex. First off, from my perspective, she used you. Which still sucks, but, she wasn't the best person in the world to begin with. Cheating on you definitely takes the cake, and hopefully shows you that the ""caring"" person who was there for you didn't really care at all. I'm sorry you had to experience that but at least you know what to avoid in the future. You are already a better person than her and shouldn't dwell on what transpired between you two. Be thankful you can look forward to finding someone who will love you endlessly. 

The money scam. This is all just fucked, but, at least you haven't been doxxed, threatened, or stalked by this person. I understand being paranoid about them having your info but honestly if they were going to use it against you they would have already done so. It's definitely a loss and a lesson learned, but that's about it. Nothing to major to stress yourself out about. I understand being broke and sick and in need, but this could have been much much worse. 

I just want you to see that these things aren't purely black and white and as terrible as you believe. I know it's hard to see now but I hope in the coming days you are able to accept it more easily. I hope you get to feeling better and understand that life only gives us what we were made to handle."

She's financially covering her own ass and that baby when you find out it isn't yours. Absolutely no other reason to take half of the money. There isn't any more tip toeing around this and trying to be nice about it. She's doing things behind your back out of response to you questioning her. Get out while you still can.

I mentioned it because now I don't qualify for BPD diagnosis but an now diagnosed bipolar and cycle through episodes off my meds. Not sure what changed in me but glad to not still feel like I used to. Seen a lot of people on here question their true diagnosis, and it can be hard sometimes to pin down the illness."
BorderlinePDisorder,eqzdrzq,t3_c00kz5,1560398317.0,"I use to have BPD, don't anymore. Reason is you have to qualify for a certain number of the symptoms of BPD to be diagnosed with it. I think there are like 10 and you have to show at least 7 (I think, don't see me if I'm wrong). Anyways, look up the criteria for BPD. The reason you have to have spany to be considered BPD is because other mental health problems (bipolar, schizo, PTSD) can look like bpd"
