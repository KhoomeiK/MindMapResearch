People with this problem who are depressed understand it, a lot of people don’t (and there’s also depressed people who shower daily). To explain... picking out clean clothes, washing my hair, getting dressed and back into bed is HARD and completely overwhelming. You just don’t care that much about yourself and what energy you have is used up with things like eating and household things. 

I’m at 1-2 days at the moment. Will probably aim for daily in summer if I can handle it."

I always knew I’d have children and wanted to be a mother. I was in deep, deep love. She was a dream come true and I’m still with her Dad and we have 2 more - one at 25, the other 27.  I’m now 40 and I know it’s cliche, but she is my best friend and I am hers. I’m just as in love with her now as I was when I first laid eyes on her. 

So I truly wouldn’t change a thing."
AmItheAsshole,f35yihw,t1_f3502n9,1570697882.0,"I completely agree with this. Sorry OP but I also think YTA, you didn’t even give the poor kid (your only nephew) a chance past 4 whole hours? What? He must’ve been so scared, his Mum would’ve been spiraling for a long time, then she just left him with a stranger, and now he’ll be around even more strangers while he’s in the system. 

Your sister is obviously so unwell that she left her child with you in such a way. The delivery might not have been perfection but she is in a very hard place, she’s not really rational but is responsible and with it enough to check herself in. I know this is ‘not your problem’ but you could’ve at least given it more time than 4 hours to evaluate the situation and how you COULD help your only sister. 

What’s done is done, I hope she gets him back and this doesn’t alter their relationship. I will also admit that I have severe MH issues and diagnosis’s so my judgement might be clouded. I just really feel sorry for her and now her child..."

I understand it’s not possible every single night, but I wanted the majority of meals together. No distractions, just us. 

Unfortunately it’s now maybe once a week, sometimes 2. He didnt end up enforcing it really and gets impatient when the kids talk, lag, and don’t eat quickly enough. He gets up to leave or clean up before I/ we have finished and I find that *incredibley* rude and disrespectful. So he only comes to the table once a week. (We are not together anymore, but live under the same roof, this disrespect isn’t new). I eat with the kids a lot, sometimes two of them or one. And I find it incredibly respectful to enjoy the meal I have cooked for them showing table manners. It’s just important to me..."
