It'd be a first for someone to be directly listening to the namesake of their Stand while not acknowledging the fact that they're identical (although they still make *other* musical references). At times, Araki just has the characters explicitly give original explanations for why a Stand is called the way it is (e.g. Jolyne naming her Stand ""Stone Free"" after her desire to be *""free from this 'stone ocean'""* instead of the Jimi Hendrix song; nobody questioning where ""Foo Fighters"" got their name from).

My bad if I misunderstood. I agree that playing with his food wasn't the smartest thing to do, but Dabi is arrogant and was also really mad in that moment, so he probably didn't think strategically.

No, you're right; I wasn't really clear with my point. But I guess I'm more critical with Dabi because he doesn't have enough skill or achievements to back up his arrogance, and, well, his actions directly led to the death of Twice (who was one of my favourite characters).

> As unpopular an opinion as it is on this sub, I actually like Dabi as a character. I think it's fitting of him to bring Hawks into the PLF despite not trusting him since he apparently follows Stain's ideals and we already knew that he doesn't take kindly to villains (as seen when he destroyed those street thugs). I always assumed he only joined the League to use them as a stepping stone and I never thought he truly cared about any of them, so his actions so far haven't surprised me one bit. He has his own agenda, whatever that is, and won't hesitate to throw his own comrades under the bus to reach his goals, and I love that because it's such a drastic contrast compared to the rest of the League.

Even so, until we learn what his true endgame is, I can't see Dabi's actions as being anything but detrimental to both the League and his own apparent desire to ""fulfill Stain's will"".

I'd be fine with Dabi being a rude ass to the rest of the League if he actually showed more that he took some accountability for his mistakes (not just Twice's death, but stuff like the High-End incident inadvertently bringing *more* support to Endeavour as the new #1 hero) and at least *pretended* to value them beyond merely being a powerful workforce. Dabi could've never gotten as far as he did without Shigaraki's help.

> I actually think Horikoshi wants fans to find Dabi as antagonistic and unsympathetic as possible. We still know so little about him that I don't mind the Touya plotline being the major thing about his character right now, just like I don't mind the way Compress is right now; I'll wait until their respective arcs are fully explored before making up my mind on them.

That's fine, but until then, it doesn't give us much to latch on to as a character. It's like how the Boss from Part 5 of *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* was intentionally designed to be as mysterious and enigmatic as possible, but >!once we get his reveal (as shortlived as his appearance towards the end of the Part is, his personality is barely different to any other generic Big Bad.!< So the execution falls flat (at least for me).

Compress, despite arguably having even less of an explored backstory than Dabi, has at least shown more personality and endearing traits than Dabi ever did.

> But at the end of the day, it's a matter of personal taste and I understand why others may not like Dabi, especially with the way a lot of fans treat him. It's just that if I see criticism that I feel is undeserved, I will correct it.

That is understandable.

What's inconsistent about Tusk's portrayal?"
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fqprnl5,t1_fqpqovs,1589552692.0,"OK then. Although I never said Hawks could get away; just that it would've benefited Dabi to be more cautious given how his expectations had already been exceeded once before. But I admit that I could've made my point clearer.

And sorry, the ""fuck Dabi"" comment is just me venting because I'm still annoyed at Dabi bringing Hawks into the League/PLF while stating that he never trusted him from the start, directly leading to Twice's death. Plus, like many others have said, I'm kinda disappointed that the Touya Todoroki plotline is pretty much the only thing Dabi's character has going for him at the moment, given his relationship with the other League members are pretty lacking in substance."
ContraPoints,fqpr9sj,t1_fqpp402,1589552484.0,Good for you. lol
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fqpqph6,t1_fqppg7r,1589552177.0,"He believes in his own hype too much lol

The only Pro Hero he's ever actually killed was Snatch, and that was mostly thanks to Compress coming in clutch at the end (since sand doesn't burn). But nonetheless, Dabi got all the credit."
CharacterRant,fqpqkw8,t3_gjthc2,1589552108.0,"It's my favourite *Spider-Man* /movie. The only things I didn't really like about it were that Peni Parker and Spider-Ham felt superfluous as characters, like they were only added to round out the whole ""alternate universe Spideys"" group."
CharacterRant,fqpqhol,t1_fqn5rla,1589552060.0,"> Also Miles is Afro-Latino and that already makes him better than Peter.

lolwut"
CharacterRant,fqpq77z,t1_fqpl9md,1589551901.0,I do agree with that; I'm not a fan of *Super* myself. But I know it's popular in some circles if only it's just more *DB* material and it gave us a few good new characters.
