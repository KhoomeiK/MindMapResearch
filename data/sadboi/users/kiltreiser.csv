""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.

""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""

Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken.

""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.

Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.

TEFL,ezizacz,t3_d18c5o,1567935895.0,Bears zero resemblance to my experience teaching high school there. But then again SCMP is a somewhat less than reliable news source.

taiwan,ez873tw,t1_ez7s1xb,1567735792.0,"Yeah, if Taiwan gains recognition it will be as an independent nation, not as the delusional remnants of a bunch of cowards who ran away from a fight and instead terrorised, tortured, and robbed a neighbouring population for decades."
AskReddit,eyy4jx1,t3_cz6fi1,1567571169.0,"Cram schools. I live and teach in Taiwan, and pretty much every kid goes to some kind of cram school after their regular school from Grade 1 up to 9 or later. They'll often finish school around 5 then go to the cram school around 6 or 7 and stay there as late as 9 or 10. Then be expected to get enough sleep for school the next day. Every single study out there looking at time spent in school versus academic achievement can tall you that this is way too much. It's actively harming their education while depriving them of their childhoods and causing insane amounts of stress, anxiety, and depression.   


But the people who run these schools? Yeah, they're making money hand over fist. And they've convinced the populace that it's the only way for your kid to do well. I taught at one for 5 years and I will never, ever be part of that system again. Instead I now actively recommend that my students tell their parents they're sick of it."
Teachers,eyxuou9,t1_eyxuh5c,1567563004.0,"The ESL department has a fair amount of autonomy, and that's likely to increase in the coming years as Taiwan moves to becoming officially bilingual. I think there is a possibility that change can be made within the department if not the school. But yeah, I definitely make sure my own classes are  nothing like what was being discussed."
Teachers,eyxsr0j,t1_eyxnmpu,1567561605.0,"Thing is, this isn't an international school or anything. It's a private high school, and it's Taiwan. Technically the government is trying to move forward from the dark ages of corporal punishment and all that. Realistically there's still an element of 'anything goes'. This is a really good job, and other schools are likely to have the same issues. If I can get my licence and get to a decent international school or government school I'm sure it will be a little better. I totally get where you're coming from (and mostly considered it because of the other teacher with the vendetta against me), but I'd really rather at least try to fix the problem than jump ship."
