""I'm depressed,"" for garden variety sadness
""I'm OCD,"" for people who are neat

I also only tell people I really trust about my BP2. I don't want someone's prejudices to color their understanding of me. Most people's understanding of it comes from some unstable BP person in their life who was unwilling to change or try treatment.

Coronavirus,fkz3hid,t1_fkyxo2s,1584661950.0,"What are we doing, Karen? Basically staying in!?!?! I was out today on essential business and there were so many boomers (80 percent of the people). Like, we're basically doing this (freezing the economy) for you (you know, the demographic this is SLAUGHTERING) and you don't even take it seriously. One Boomer dude was very rude to me for wearing a face mask... that I already owned pre-pandemic (so hold the phone on that hoarding lecture). Face masks help you not spread your germs to others. Even the CDC admits that. COVID-19 has an incubation of 8 days average, so even though I feel fine, I could be a carrier. I was literally wearing a mask to avoid killing that dude. Boomers (defined as people like you, NOT EVERYONE IN YOUR DEMOGRAPHIC, who hate on millenials and refuse to have empathy or even acknowledge established facts and trends about how we have a worse quality of life than you did) are astoundingly selfish and stupid.

Good Baby Boomers:
Listen to their children when they talk about how this economy dooms us to a lower quality of life. 
Listen to scientific evidence about pandemics, climate change, economic trends, etc.
Encourage and work toward change with us.
Appreciate our attempts to not kill them and STAY HOME. 

You: probably do the opposite of all of those things. Do your kids talk to you anymore, Karen?"
