EDH,fqvkew7,t1_fqssdog,1589679170.0,"Yup! So in my cube specifically we draft five packs.

The first pack is the legendary pack containing 5 legends per pack (more or less depending).

The next three packs containing 20 cards each from the main cube set.

And then the last pack is the mana pack containing 15 mana fixing cards. 

Then each player builds 60 card EDH deck around the Legend they decide to build around and then break into pods of four.

Color identity still applies but I’ve added custom cards to help make the draft experience more fun (I.e. a card that lets you add blue to the color identity of the commander you build around).

The cube has been extremely fun and functional so far. Each time we drafted, everyone’s deck got to do what they wanted and because players can only build decks from the cards they draft, deck building creativity shines here."

I'm trying to figure out just how many Tims I may need to make the deck work without having to use a \[\[Quicksilver Elemental\]\] (though tha card is just too good in this deck not to include). I was thinking of maybe including 5 Tims and 5 Untap cards, and fill some slots for abilities that give death touch, as well as infect as a secondary win condition. I also think a fun way to kill off your opponents is by using \[\[Tree of Perdition\]\]s ability to make an opponents life total 4, and then using \[\[Spikeshot Elder\]\]s ability to deal the lethal blow. But if you have any other feedback for this direction let me know! I will try to update this post with a list as soon as I get close to finishing. :)"

EDH,fmumwml,t1_fmulrc7,1586394557.0,"Yeah good points. However I feel like white provides so many other powerful token generators and some at lower costs that it seems like it could work out great here.

The problem I have with my Brudiclad deck right now is that it’s often times too slow. Either all the copy effects cost too much or he’s easily removed. 

Akim only makes one token on each turn but they’re fliers and making all of your tokens into an aerial assault (tokens, gold and all) seem like a good back up plan. And even though their activated ability costs 6 mana, giving all tokens double strike seems kind of gross as a finisher.

Now being able to turn all of your tokens into huge flying threats (maybe you create a copy of a powerful angel) and then giving them double strike just seems very good.

Personally I love Brudiclad and his effect is so unique but I often times feel behind because the deck takes so much mana to do anything in the early game.

If you have a decklist you can share that kind of solves this issue that would be a huge help. :)"

magicTCG,fmi63ct,t3_fvfyxp,1586103184.0,"Just from scanning the comments.

Players: We want white ramp!
Wizards: Here ya go!
Players: Not good enough.

Do you think you’re entitled to get exactly what you want?

It’s a turn 3 ramp spell in white.
Has evasion so it most likely will always connect.
And the bounce effects works really nice to get additional card advantage using a card like Mentor of the Meek.

It may only ramp in terms of catching up to those who ramp harder, but when white has access to the most powerful and versatile removal, this is just fine and feels very white. Don’t like it? Don’t play it. 

Mono red has a similar issue with ramp being “too slow.” Runaway Steamkin is a great example that takes you casting three red spells to generate mana. And that card sees play in mono red decks.

Just my two cents but seeing people complaining about not getting there way is just so exhausting that this needed to be said."
magicTCG,fmgod8v,t3_fv5inw,1586053627.0,"I’ve seen a lot of comments mentioning how this isn’t the “ramp” card they were expecting.

And though Gavin did mention these hints were taken out of context, I kind of find it hard to believe that he’d hint at white ramp as a way to piss more players off with a white card advantage card instead.

Not saying anyone is pissed, because this is a card mono white desperately needed. But I’m not convinced this is the card Gavin was referring to as “ramping Plains from your library”.

Three white decks, one in green and one with access to blue makes it a pretty safe bet that this card lives in mardu. But with jeskai being even worse off with access to ramp than mardu (I’m looking at you urborg/cabal coffers), my HOPE is that the cycling deck will contain the Plains ramp card. 

Wishful thinking, and I’ve been disappointed before; but I don’t believe Gavin to jerk players around THAT much. Especially being he’s focused on commander for the entire year."
EDH,fmgne5x,t1_fmgmpkd,1586052930.0,"Yeah that was my thought too.

I own my own Brudiclad deck and the deck can be very powerful. The name of the game, though, is to win with Brudiclads ability the turn he comes into play. Amassing a bunch of treasure tokens and token copies of big creatures and BAM brudiclad gives you a very powerful army. 

My favorite thing to make a token copy of in that deck is wurmcoil engine, as all the toke copies will have the same death triggers and each create two additional tokens each which will help you keep from being completely wiped out.

That said, both can be good but you need to build the decks appropriately and also to the play style that you find the most fun. If you’re looking to play superfriends, the Kykar list could be a good start.

EDH,evtovx7,t3_cl8mxg,1564775081.0,"I can see it from both sides.

Here is my POV:

The face commanders don’t scream “yes! I want to build this!” Building around mechanics is a neat idea but the ones they chose may have some difficult without redundancy. Madness and populate for instance are very linear and not quite broken in terms of power level. That said, I disagree with the hate coming from that perspective. 

EDH was INTENDED for casual play and we got casual friendly face commanders. They’re very simple in design and to be honest, that’s a good thing. This product is meant to bring new players into the format not scare them away in confusion. Though us veteran players value this product to fuel our need to brew and add more to the card pool, it’s not just for us.

If we look at C17, the face of the tribes were also kind of lack luster – minus the fact that eminence is a broken mechanic. But what was more interesting were the additional commanders. Hell, Mairsil, the Pretender is my favorite legendary creature of all time.  Even C18 (though a bust) gave us cool cards like Xantcha and Varina (both nonface cards).

My point: the hate on the product is too early but I can see where veteran players might be disappointed as these cards represent a lot of what we have seen in the past and our need to brew comes from creatively designed cards."
