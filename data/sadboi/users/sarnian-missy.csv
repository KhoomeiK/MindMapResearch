Well done on recognising the specific things you're feeling, I've found that regularly checking in with yourself about those feelings helps to recognise if they are becoming a problem. In my experience, spreading these feelings and emotions among more people has made them easier to control if they flare up.

For me the BP lows override the BPD highs so I'll just sink into depression for months, but I'm now finding the manic episodes easier to control because I recognise them faster.

There is also a chance of him wanting to be open further down the road. Do some research on polyamory and Ethical non monogamy. Learning about it will help you decide if it's something you could do or not but it will also teach you about how to communicate and navigate your insecurities. 

The poly thing aside. If he doesn't want a relationship but you do, that's an incompatibility that needs addressing before you get hurt. Our BPD brains don't handle rejection well and most knowledgeable poly people would understand the need for reassurance or setting boundaries."

I've been actively poly on and off for decades and I've been exposed to every emotion between jealousy, fear and elation. It's hard work but every single person in my network is comfortable because we are able to openly discuss our fears and have them heard. 

Figure out what you want from this situationship before you ask him for a chat. Give him a couple of days to think about what he wants. Make notes (Trust me, make notes) and have a look at poly communication. Poly.land was like my bible when I first explored this lifestyle. He may of course want completely different things and it's then your choice as a ""couple"" to see if they're negotiable.

Jumping to another fp isn't healthy (and I'm sorry I can't explain how to do this) but cultivating meaningful, not dependent, relationships with multiple people spreads the load when you need someone and introduces you to even more people who may become future friends.

Your relationship with your FP may not be over if you're both able to communicate honestly about how you feel and if you're both receptive to understanding why it happened and how to prevent it in the future. Which is why I'd also recommend researching healthy FP relationship boundaries.

I will tell restaurants that I have an intolerance to shellfish as I personally don't want to put them through the hassle of allergy procedures. 

Eating Prawns makes me ill but I'm eating takeaway rice I've picked them out of, (which my cats adore me for) Muscles need an ER visit, oysters and scampi just need an antihistamine. I've stopped testing things since the lobster incident when my hands doubled in size with an itchy rash just from handling it. I also keep 2 different antihistamines with me as peanuts aren't great for me either."

My shoulders need a rest day or two but I'm definitely adding those exercises in. Thank you."

I'm still getting a slight twinge sometimes but my form has improved. I managed a very slow and painless descent tonight after a successful first attempt at lifting into a chopper."
BPD,fiv1ens,t3_fa00l6,1582752066.0,"Not sure if this would work for others but I try to have a few FPs who fulfil different needs for me. 

One loves horror films, one is my partner, one is a chat about anything bestie with lots of common interests, there's my sister, my gym buddy, the one who understands my BPD. Any friend I spend a few hours with can also be my FP for that short period. 

I learned to love my own solitude and I found that I now make time to do the things I want to do without needing someone else to do it with."
BDSMcommunity,fisd693,t1_firweah,1582682573.0,"I'm always hesitant to use ""should"" and I completely agree that it is good practice to negotiate extended aftercare for both parties. Even if it's not wanted, it still needs stating to avoid ambiguity."
BDSMcommunity,firus0k,t1_firt1jv,1582671596.0,"This. 

Part of aftercare ""should"" include checking in over the next few hours and days. This is especially true after a first scene where neither of you know how you or the other will react as the chemicals in your body return to normal. 

""Should"" - Not everyone wants to be checked on. I'm personally ok without it after over 2 years into my dynamic but would consider it a red flag if a new partner didn't get in contact or return my messages for that long. 

As a Top, I absolutely check on play partners the next day because I need to know that they're ok."
AmItheAsshole,fipus3i,t1_finhpa5,1582622460.0,Poly comments always get down voted on posts like this because people are afraid of lifestyles they don't understand. 🤷🏻‍♀️ I won't lose any sleep over it.
depression,fipunge,t1_fioeznc,1582622266.0,Be open to their advice and guidance and give it all the effort you can. Anyone can be helped but nobody can fix it for us.
depression,fio9yop,t3_f8xtrs,1582579168.0,Well done. Asking for help is a hard step. I'm proud of you.
AmItheAsshole,fing8c3,t1_fimznd9,1582562814.0,Which conclusion please?
