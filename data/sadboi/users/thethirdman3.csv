Foofighters,fne4z1n,t1_fne44c9,1586883149.0,No need to be a dick man. Just trying to encourage some friendly discussion about it. What else do we have to do? Agree about the single though.
Foofighters,fndfqsx,t1_fndfh5w,1586868912.0,"Technically you‚Äôre right. But speculation would have it that the album or at the very least a single would be out by now. Things were starting to roll (Press hearing the album, mag articles about Dave and the album, tour announcement, Dave publicly announcing that the album was finished, etc.) but then this pandemic happened and it‚Äôs been radio silence from the Foo camp (except for news about the tour postponement). I‚Äôm not complaining, I understand the circumstances why they would have to delay their album if that is indeed the case here. I‚Äôm just speculating that the whole album cycle has been delayed."
Foofighters,fndc4wt,t1_fndby5l,1586866119.0,Totally agree with you. No album is gonna turn any sort of profit in this climate.
Foofighters,fndb5dd,t1_fndav21,1586865269.0,It very well could have been a standalone thing. I just would‚Äôve thought they would release at least a single before the Van Tour. And I believe Dave has said the album is finished as of maybe a month and a half ago?

He‚Äôs moved on and made some really great albums since the split and has really ventured into new territories (Boarding House Reach being the best example of that).

jackwhite,ffk2s1h,t3_eu18mv,1580014034.0,"It sounded like you and your dad had an awesome bond. Especially through the music of JW. Some of my best memories I‚Äôve made have been with my dad at some badass rock shows. So it deeply saddens me to hear your story and my heart hurts for you. But you‚Äôre an absolute fucking beast for going solo to his shows. That shits not easy, I‚Äôve done it a lot.

But for me, ever since I‚Äôve discovered Jack, my outlook on the world we live in has vastly changed. On more than just a musical perspective as well. I‚Äôm a musician, who moved to Nashville (of course), to pursue music. Jack no doubt is a huge part of my identity as a musician, and as a person. The way he runs Third Man and basically catapulted the vinyl renaissance, still astounds me. I think it‚Äôs the first time a musician has crossed into the Management/Manufacturing realm and really succeeded, and with a physical product in an increasingly intangible world to boot.

Sorry for the rant but yeah. Jack holds some of my fondest memories. Seeing him in venues like Radio City Music Hall, Madison Square Garden, Ryman Auditorium, Bridgestone Arena, and even the Blue Room at TMR, have been landmark moments in my life. Along with literally EVERYTHING the man has written. 

Thanks for sharing your story. I really enjoyed it. :)"
