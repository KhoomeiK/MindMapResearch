*Maybe*

Maybe you're just a clingy person. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, unless you aren't self aware about it and don't reign in your emotions.

I am *wildly* attached to my girlfriend, it's been several months, approaching half a year, and that attachment hasn't faded a bit. I'm in the same boat you are and have been since the start as far as it goes for wanting to be near her 24/7.

But it's fun to be that attached! It's fun to be clingy and it's fun to have that strong of feelings for somebody. 

It's only unhealthy if it keeps you from doing anything else, or if it's negatively affecting your relationship. 

I always control myself and I never let these feelings fully ""out,"" because I respect that she needs space and she needs time apart from me. Which I'm totally fine with, because I know whether I want it or not, *I* need the same amount of space too. Sometimes needs aren't fun, like eating vegetables when you were a kid, or getting exercise in when you don't feel like it. It doesn't feel good, so it's hard to see that it's good for you. 

That said, it's important that you maintain hobbies and friendships you've had outside your relationships prior to this. It can be hard, but you have to make yourself focus on these things and eventually you'll feel a little less crazy.

I don't think she's the one, chief. 

If the idea of a future spent with girl you're currently dating doesn't make you super excited and isn't something you think about and work towards regularly, I don't think she's the one for you. 

On another note, you bring up your girlfriend's problems in a way that suggests you'll likely end up resenting her for them later on. This is *not* a stab at you and is totally understandable, just an observation. 

Most highschool based relationships fail and that's the sad fact of the matter. It won't be the end of her world or yours, and if it ends, then you both will inevitably move on. 

I don't think it's cool, however, to keep this a secret. You need to be upfront with her. Did her worst fears come true? Yes. But also, you've spent a large portion of your life with this person. You owe her and your relationship you've had with her respect, and the best way to pay respects to both is to come clean. Wouldn't you want that if you were in her shoes?

It's gonna be difficult and it's gonna hurt. I would like to say, however, that I'm not telling you to end things with your girlfriend. Just pointing out a few things.

HOWEVER

Crushes are a common occurrence in relationships. You could've tasted something new, and been temporarily derailed from the bigger picture. If what you have with your girlfriend is special, and something you want to build upon for the future, don't let a two week crush mess that up for you.

You think you people would've learned to use a different tactic by now. You're going to have to rise above that if you want to rally more support."
relationship_advice,etsrrlq,t3_cdacef,1563153703.0,"You're human. It's perfectly natural to be attracted physically to other girls, and I *guarantee* she is physically attracted to other guys.

You can't be the thought police. Especially with 100% natural, *entirely unavoidable* urges. What you do with those urges determines what kind of person you are. You can have these thoughts, admit you have them, and move right along. It's perfectly normal, you are just like everyone else. Please don't beat yourself up over it and *please* ignore everyone telling you to ""just end it now."" That's entirely ridiculous."

And keep in mind, 2 years *until maybe* you can get a good salary. You aren't guaranteed a job, and you have a lot of debt that $8 could be going towards paying off instead of another drink, which seems to be a bit of an issue. 

Sounds like you guys have a lot of discussion to do. Not attacking you or anything, but I sense heavily there is more to this story than your side."
relationship_advice,etsqhpy,t3_cdao22,1563152686.0,"She's going to stress about you when you're stressed. That's her thing. As a girlfriend who loves you, she's going to worry and she's going to be anxious about you dealing with problems. 

*It's okay for someone to worry about you.*

It means they love you and they're going to regardless of whether or not you want them to or not. It's okay to not want them to worry! I get that. But it's part of the process.

HOWEVER.

If she's making it about *her* stress and deflects the attention that's supposed to be in your problems to *her* stress and feelings about your problems, that's a red flag. It's one thing to stress and worry for your loved ones. Its another to try to steal the spotlight from them when they're under pressure."

He didn't say ""gO bAcK tO yOuR oWn CoUnTrY."" He's telling them to go fix their own Homeland before coming here and telling us how to ""fix"" ours.

It isn't racist at all and you people are ridiculous."

I followed that during basic, being a relatively big fella, and lost a little over 30 pounds. Not only that, but it taught me how to eat, and since graduation I've lost 20 *more* pounds. 

It's very effective!"
