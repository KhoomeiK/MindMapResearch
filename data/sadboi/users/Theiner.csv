depression,ewnxjwl,t3_cp1ajy,1565595318.0,"I feel this too! I still have the motivation to meet people and I have different groups of friends, but Im still the disposable one / last option in each group.

Trying for relationships is even more jarring. Ive had some dates that seemingly go well but then suddenly after just a day Ive been dropped. 

I always feel like I have to put in so much effort just to maintain friends/relationships. I end up exhausted then shut myself for a while.

I dont have any solutions. Ive just been pretending to ignore that lonely feeling but when Im alone, I keep asking myself whats wrong with me?? 

Im already 29. I keep hoping Ill turn it all around but part of me.. is just.. in the dark"
