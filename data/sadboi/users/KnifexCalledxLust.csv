However, when I went to college, I did not follow through with continuing these services. I ended up dropping out of college within the first yeae because I just could not cope on my own. I really regret it. 

Don't let other people make you feel unworthy. If those services help you, focus on that. Your well being is the most important thing. Best of luck in college!"
UnresolvedMysteries,fdv1beg,t3_en1gr1,1578741955.0,"Celina Mays- 12 year old girl disappears almost 2 weeks before she is due to give birth in 1996. This one drives me insane because every theory has a hole. A 12 year old who is that heavily pregnant can't just vanish on her own and stay hidden this long. Can she? Why wait till she due to give birth to murder her? If she died giving birth, where is her body? What happened to the baby? There are so many questions."
UnresolvedMysteries,fduzbq9,t1_fdtjzdo,1578741309.0,"I flop flop back and forth about the stepmom. I don't think she killed him because her day was pretty well documented and I don't know I just can't see her doing it. But I do wonder what more she knows. Over the years, the stepmom has been just weird (like that hit she had placed on her husband, Kyron's dad) and the whole thing with her friend. Something doesn't add up about her."
UnresolvedMysteries,fdueglt,t1_fdua4l8,1578731886.0,"/u/PM_ME_YOUR_DALEKS I have always liked the brother angle as well. I'm not an expert but if the true crime shows taught me anything, if you are innocent then there is nonreason to lie. The brother's stories have more holes than swiss cheese and none of them benefit his sister. I think it is very telling that he claimed to have been on the phone with her as she supposedly went to help. By making her death look heroic, it would take away the shame of her 'questionable'  actions. Not that I find them questionable but her family certainly didn't approve of her drinking or hooking up with females. Which I think was the brother's motive; shame and anger over his sister's actions."
toddlers,fdsfhue,t3_ems3m3,1578701570.0,"My oldest was like that! Slept through the night by 9 months. He used to take 4 hour naps. It was freakin awesome! 

Then I had my second who I swears thrives on as little sleep as possible. He's 3. He woke up today at 6.50 and despite how exhausted he looked all day, he is still going and it is 7 pm.  He did not sleep through the night till 2 and half. 

Brag now while you can! I certainly did lol."
Parenting,fdjwraz,t3_elnd8u,1578489981.0,"Ugh, both of mine. 

I stay home with my 3 year old and man, it is awesome. He tells me all the time how much he loves, I'm the best mommy ever and tells me all nice positive things. Sometimes when I do routine mundane things (like vacuuming or picking up a toy), he cheers me on. 

My oldest just like to hug me just because. He told me the other day that he thinks we should open a bookstore. We are both huge readers and I always wanted to own a bookstore so that was music to my ears. These kids are legit my best friends."
toddlers,fd8o2gv,t1_fd88sny,1578220762.0,"It was my dad's one job. My husband even warned him our toddler does that. With our oldest, he can at least be prepped on what is right and wrong. Although lately, my mom has been letting him doing things I am not too sure about. 

My husband's family is big on oh let the kids play together someone is always watching. It is super weird to me."
thingsmykidsaid,fd7if7m,t3_ek27dx,1578205035.0,"When I was heavily pregnant with my second, I wore a lot of sweat pants. I don't typically wear sweat pants but you know comfort is huge when you are heavily pregnant. I was feeling self conscious about the sweat pants one morning before taking my then 6 year old to school. He stops at the front door, looks at me and goes, ""you just look like a guy right now, mommy.""

I almost changed right then and there. Lol"
toddlers,fd4jnha,t3_ek136w,1578168122.0,"My parents are kind of the opposite. My dad is ok with short short term helping out with my two kids. My mom would love for them to be over all weekend every weekend. However, seeing my mom being a grandma makes me wonder how the hell she raised two kids of her own. She makes terrible decisions. 

My toddler is also high energy. He does not sit and play with toys nor is he easy going. Given the chance, he will run off. In fact, one time my husband came over to my parents's home to help my dad with something. My dad's one job was to watch our toddler. He did not. My husband found our toddler on the other side of the neighborhood. So yea. The toddler is not allowed in their care alone."
AskReddit,fd2gzpm,t1_fd2fg43,1578147076.0,"My husband and I went one year to see the ball drop in New York. A woman legit pissed herself and it was like a ripple effect. The entire crowd shifted away from her, which was impressive because there was no room to move. It was utterly disgusting. I can see why people wear diapers though because the next time I was able to find and use a bathroom was at 2 am. I was in a lot of pain from holding in for so long. 

The crowds were terrible. Right as the ball was dropping, some asshole lifted his girlfriend up so she could see better. But in doing so, they blocked the view for other people. It was certainly a once in a lifetime only type thing."
YouOnLifetime,fd0z0pd,t3_ejnlz5,1578125698.0,"I've always been a paranoid kind of person. So if you were to stalk me via social media, it'd be pretty hard. I try to leave as little clues as possible. If I post pictures of me somewhere, I always post them way after I have left. I never understood the people who'd tag where they were or posted pictures of where they were. I don't need someone knowing where I am. 

You'd be surprised by how easy it is to find out people's personal info based on the stuff they posted online."
toddlers,fckhcxn,t3_ehj8rz,1577725356.0,"When my oldest was little, I started writing down things he'd say. I continued this with my second. My toddler is by far the weirdest of the two. 

'I want to eat your butt.' 'I love your butt.' - often said in public. He has a weird fascination with my butt. Idk how to make it stop. It's weird.

'I need to say hi to my spiders (my hands).'

'I want to have a poop party.' 

'Why is that person looking at me!?' - often said when we are in a small crowd. 

I am pretty introverted so I typically die whenever something comes out of his mouth.

Edit: spelling mistakes"

Parenting,fcgrtih,t3_eh6pga,1577643439.0,"My first child was the result of my birth control failing. I don't regret having him even if his sperm donor checked out on us. My oldest literally saved me. I didn't have my second until 6 years later when I was married. 

I wish I had been able to have kids with only one person. I wish I had been able to have them closer in age. I wish I could have more. I am still trying to find acceptance. But my kids are the most important thing to me and that's ultimately what I need to focus on."
SAHP,fcfik9q,t3_eh5opp,1577630367.0,"I have the opposite problem. My 3 yr old is like a caged animal if he stays in the house too long. I personally find myself becoming too lazy if we stay home too long. We go out a lot but mostly to parks or playgrounds, the library, the mall. I keep an eye out for free or cheap events because we don't have a lot of money. Mom groups have never worked out for me. It sucks going out alone but we have a lot of fun even if it just us. My kids love a good adventure. 

My husband, however, would prefer it if we were home more. He complains about how much gas I waste or how the house looks messy (it's slightly messy but I like a little creative chaos). It drives me insane.

Edit to add a few things. 

Everything falls on me as well. It sucks. I never get a break. I hide in the bathroom for a small break. I wish I could give better advice other than embrace the small moments you do get to yourself. 

I often took my toddler to the park because he could just run wild and watching him was easy. I didn't have to worry about too much. Keep an eye on facebook for free or low cost events in your area. Check the library. Check out your local parks and playgrounds. Check out the play place at the mall or at a fast food place. Take walks. I keep my car stocked with clothes, towels and plastic bags so my kid can jump in puddles or can wade in the creek. There are so many cool things you can find. Good luck!"
Parenting,fccj5k0,t3_egsxcc,1577598996.0,"I had my first child at 21. Prior to having him, I was a pretty depressed person. I'm talking self harming and all. I could barely take care of myself and next thing I know I gotta take care of a baby alone. I totally feel like I fucked up my son's younger years simply because I was still learning to take care of myself. 

It's been 10 years since and I have had a second child. I still have no clue what I am doing half the time. But at the end of the day, if all our needs are met and everyone is relatively happy, then I think I did alright."

I have two kids of my own now and I promised myself that I would never be the mother she was. I tell my kids every chance I get that I love them. I hug them and cuddle them. I listen to them even if the topic doesn't interest me. I do all the things she never did with me. I don't want them to ever feel an ounce of what I did. 

I wish you all the luck and happiness. ‚ù§"
