NTA: Think about it this way maybe it will help. 

You don’t want kids,family, marriage etc. IF you take this responsibility, unfortunately at some point,  consciously or not , you will start to unload your sadness or feelings of regret on the child. Everything you “could” have done if he wasn’t here. That slowly turns into unhappiness, frustration then hatred. You will always see the child as a negative in your life. At no fault of his own. Eventually both of you would hate each other as he becomes a young adult. 

There is nothing wrong with saying no, specially if  you have your own life plan that doesn’t include another person. Be there for him emotionally if he ever needs a cool uncle to hang out with once a month or whatever. Maybe take him on a trip one day just to chill and be buddy’s not a parent figure. My uncle did that for me and i always thanked him for that. 

As a father myself, I’m telling you, don’t do what won’t make you happy."
