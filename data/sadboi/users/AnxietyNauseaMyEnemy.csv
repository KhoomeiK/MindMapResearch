Anxiety,ez57mim,t3_czqtqt,1567696605.0,"That physical symptoms are my main problem and reason why I avoid a lot of things. Especially nausea and vomiting is brutal. My stomach instantly responds to stress and it is impossible to stop that. After vomiting I feel fine, like 'Nothing wrong can happen now'. But still have diarrhae. This shit destroyed my life."
Anxiety,eyqece5,t1_eyppumj,1567339738.0,"I am glad that you are making progress. Keep doing that!

Do I understand correctly, that you don't drink milk at all? Is this not negative for your body, for example your bones?

Of course vomiting is not good. I try not to vomit, but it is getting that bad, that I have to. There is nothing I can do about it, because I can't stop thinking about it, when my stomach is on 100%-nausea-mode. At this time I am scared about throwing up in public. So the panic gets even worse. Then I vomit at home and everything is ""fine"".

Sometimes when I get nauseous in public, because I ate something, I panic too. Looking out for places where I could vomit (a bin, or an empty street). But the problem is. I really don't want to vomit, because it is in public. You say ""Who cares?"", but in my opinion there are a lot of people who care. For me it is embarrassing. Nobody laughed at me because I did vomit, but still it is so uncomfortable. Putting that ""Who cares?"" in my mind is not that easy.

I need to take a look at the book ""DARE"". But I am not speaking english that good for reading a book, I guess."
Anxiety,eyqdp0k,t1_eyphx02,1567338927.0,"I feel depressed when I have to vomit or can't do something I want to, because of my nausea, vomiting and fear of that. But on ""normal"" days I feel fine and happy imo. I think an antiemetic med would be better, since my problem is situational and not 24/7. But antiemetics are not really working for me.

My stomach is doing what it wants. :D"
Anxiety,eyqdi8r,t1_eyowtoh,1567338687.0,"Do you maybe have GERD? Because I don't feel like I have too much acid. I only vomit when I eat something before. I don't vomit when I have an empty stomach. Just gagging.

Avoiding dairy seems to be helpful. Didn't know that before. But I am only drinking a glass of milk every day. Not sure if that is already that much. I mean the body needs a bit of dairy, doesn't it?"
Anxiety,eyov2pe,t1_eyotson,1567283834.0,"I also took travel sickness medications. Dimenhydrinate (Vomex) to be precise. That made me tired, but didn't affect my stomach. I am glad that it helps you. If you are not scared about medications, you can ask your doctor for Propranolol. Maybe it will helps your stomach when you have anxiety. Too much adrenaline can cause nausea and vomiting. Propranolol stops the adrenaline. I read about a lot of people (also in reddit), that they use it for performance anxiety and they feel perfect physically, when they take Propranolol. Unfortunately, it didn't help my nausea. But everyone is different."
