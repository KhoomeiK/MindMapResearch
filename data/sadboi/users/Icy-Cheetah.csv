Otherwise all they can offer is sympathy, because that's the normal thing to do when a friend feels sad.

Good you are still hoping for true love in this fake world."
SuicideWatch,fqhsavr,t1_fqfqig6,1589383472.0,"Only love that exists in this world is self-love, all other kinds are just show-off.

It's nearly impossible, but the lesser you expect from others the better.

Similarly don't be bent by others wishes (near and dear ones,I mean specifically) if the thing is not acceptable to you. You might end up feeling wronged and empty, then
the person to whose wishes you agreed won't give a Fuck."
