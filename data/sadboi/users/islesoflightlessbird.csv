1) kyle pretends that kim is sober when it's so obvious that she's not. she's a true enabler for the sake of a storyline.


2) kyle (SOMEHOW!) always makes kims addictions about her. it's frustrating to watch so i can't imagine how frustrating kim feels. 


3) it's heartbreaking to see her lack of insight/empathy towards kim. i think it's safe to assume that their childhood was traumatic in ways we will never hear about, and we all manage trauma differently. so kyle needs to drop the substance abuse judgement and realize that their childhood was not one in the same ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
