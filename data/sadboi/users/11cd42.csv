IDmydog,f74vlmy,t1_f7233g0,1573408663.0,"Graduate of Animal Sciences, huh. Anyone can claim they're a dog trainer just like I can claim I'm a nutritionist, and lack proper credentials to give good information.

You basically just reduced my dog to a set of breed characteristics that 1) may or may not even be her breed; 2) may not be a concern if she was properly socialized. By your logic, pitbulls should not even be allowed as domestic animals, given that they have heightened incidences where they exhibit violence towards humans. You can quote Fox News as many times as you want but unless you've met my dog or are living with my dog, you know nothing about her behaviour. Period. You can have a PhD for all I care and still know less about my dog if all the info you have is 4 pictures and the fact that I'm a first-time owner. 

And to assume I would allow my dog into a dog park if I've observed any aggressive tendencies in her in the past 2 months is simply wrong and malicious of you.  

You then change the argument to be about imported dogs bringing diseases and destroying native dog populations. What are you on about? My dog has been examined in Korea by a licensed vet, examined at the border by an animal officer - both documents I have on hand which lead me to believe that the organization is reputable. What evidence do you have that it's not? Oh right, nothing. Furthermore she was examined again by a licensed vet where I live and everything was verified on my end as well (sidenote: I do not live in the States, which is another one of your baseless assumptions). She's had her full medical certificate provided to me, plus lab work done at my vet to check for parasites.
Please check yourself to make sure you have all the facts before spreading misinformation. By definition you ARE fear-mongering.

I would like to also point out that cats are very solitary creatures and I would be very careful in housing a dog with it, let alone 4. It is highly irresponsible that you have a solitary animal by nature housed together with 4 pack animals. It must be so stressed. Here is a good article that talks about cat behaviour: 

Crowell-Davis, S. L., Curtis, T. M., & Knowles, R. J. (2004). Social organization in the cat: a modern understanding.¬†Journal of feline medicine and surgery,¬†6(1), 19-28.

Also domestic cats getting killed by their canine counterparts is an occurrence that is more frequent than you think:

I hope you were able to deduce with your graduate brain that my last point was just a parody of essentially the overall effect of your comments. Jfc, I hope I never come across a gatekeeper like you ever again in the dog owner community."
IDmydog,f721ysc,t1_f6zvf5d,1573352226.0,"Thanks for your input, I'm sorry for your loss of a dear friend. And yes, while it's only been 2 months, my partner and I are making sure to monitor her closely. So far she has not exhibited any troubling behaviour (no separation anxiety, no destructive behaviour, friendly to all dogs, and very eager to please). We've been able to teach her complex tricks like bang, jump, etc. and she's such a quick learner. Had her first vet appointment last month and the vet was surprised and said that she is the most well-behaved dog she's seen in a while. I am considering obedience classes though because I would love to have an opportunity to bond with Mimi more. :)"
IDmydog,f71zrdk,t1_f7067tz,1573351244.0,"The rescue that she comes from is reputable and the executive director has spent years and years rescuing dogs from Korea. She personally interacts with these dogs one by one before she decides which dog is a good fit. At the end of the day, it was just a recommendation. My dog was not forced on me by the charity, I would like to make that point extremely clear.  

She has had her history fully provided to me with 100% transparency and any point of contention has been communicated to me prior to adoption. Furthermore, as I am the owner, I am the one who's able to observe her behaviour on a day-to-day basis which is already more information than you have to identify any issues that may arise. This comment is so extreme and fear-mongering I can't even begin to address how uncomfortable it made me. 

I hope you don't approach all new dog owners this way and I certainly hope the dog owner community doesn't attempt to infantilize and shame first-time dog-owners the way you do."
IDmydog,f6z48i2,t1_f6z3fp4,1573308485.0,"Thank you. :) She has honestly been the gentlest dog and we tell everyone that we lucked out! Especially given that she was a rescue.

AmItheAsshole,f2ywkhp,t3_delta8,1570500153.0,"YTA. As someone who was fiscally manipulated into pursuing the career my parents had wanted for me because of their perceived ""financial stability"" of the job, I can say without a doubt that it ruined my early twenties. I had no sense of agency or control over my life (they were first generation immigrants so I was burdened with the pressure of living out the life they had wanted) and had zero motivation to do well in school because I wasn't doing it for myself, but for the parents I resented. Not to mention every bad grade I received I began internalizing and attributed it to my own incompetence. I went from a straight A student in highschool with a decent amount of confidence to a low C student with non-existent self-esteem. Today, with the help of my boyfriend's family, I am able to pursue a second degree and go down the career path I had wanted all along for myself. I got A+'s in all my classes last semester and it was a sad hoorah moment that told me that it wasn't me who was stupid and lazy like I had been convinced into believing all along, but the nature of the degree I was pressured into by my parents. Had they been supportive instead of bashing me and doubting my motives, many months of therapy would have been saved and I would not have contemplated going NC back in 2017. Honestly, I'm still currently working on undoing all the damage this has had on my mental health and my relationship with my parents. OP, please listen to what your daughter has to say with an open mind and don't make the same mistakes my parents did. I promise your daughter will be grateful down the line for the positive support she received at such a critical time in her life. While you are completely not obligated to finance her tuition, it is up to you on whether or not you want to risk your relationship with her."
