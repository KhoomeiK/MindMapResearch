If only one spouse smokes, the couple is 75-91% more likely to end their marriage in divorce.

Has nothing to do with mental illness. 

Y’all, don’t sweat the stats. Just do what’s right for you. There no such thing as being doomed. There are only the choices we make and our partner makes. 

We can’t control the outcomes. And that’s ok. 

I’m divorced. I wouldn’t trade in my first marriage for anything... also I wouldn’t have stayed for much less either ;-) Had nothing to do with BP.


My BPSO is an amazing man, with a really debilitating illness. If he continues to choose to “walk it off”, things won’t end well for him. I hope he chooses to reach out for help. I love him deeply and would go to hell and back for him. But I also know that my emotional and physical safety from him is a completely different thing in entirety.

Bipolar Disorder: A Guide for Patients and Families (A Johns Hopkins Press Health Book) https://www.amazon.com/dp/1421412063/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apip_dmWMkSr5WvOTz

Loving Someone with Bipolar Disorder: Understanding and Helping Your Partner (The New Harbinger Loving Someone Series) https://www.amazon.com/dp/1608822192/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apip_cdE9rRWCa2OD7

BipolarSOs,fqjd54n,t3_gj7zpz,1589408264.0,"I hear you. I’m a 38 year old child of a schizophrenic/borderline mom, and some kind of emotionally stunted depressive dad. I was walking on eggshells my entire childhood while also playing therapist and best friend to my mom. My dad is now my regular therapy client. 

It’s exhausting. And it feels like you want to be parented but they’re just not capable. I’d tell you that it gets better but it kind of doesn’t. They won’t do the things you wish they would. My dad refused to dance with me at my wedding and didn’t prepare any remarks for the reception. My mom couldn’t even be invited due to paranoia etc. It hurt. And over the years they’ve gotten more tolerable (and I of course love them) but they aren’t particularly any better with me. However I feel a whole lot better. I’m sometimes disappointed but it doesn’t define me or the way I see myself anymore.

What makes it better is your mindset. 

For years I thought it was a cop out to say that someone loves you in their own way. I thought it was an excuse to be a crappy parent. But now I’m almost 40 and I truly see that they’re doing the best they know how. I’d wish them to be smarter (sane-r?) and more able to help guide me but that’s not what they are capable of. 

Find good people in your life to help be those sounding boards. Find a father figure in an older uncle or cousin (NOT I repeat, NOT in a romantic love interest... that never goes well). And find a support systems in good, responsible friends or a church. You need to find the nurturing you need in places that it’s healthy and available to you.

But also find comfort and acceptance in your own strength. Some of us are meant to go it alone. And that’s not a bad thing. 

You’re strong, insightful, mature, loving, nurturing... and you were made that way for a reason. Any other person might not have made it through growing up in your situation. 

One day you’ll be on a forum telling someone else that it’s ok... you’ll be ok. 💛"

Just give them a little grace and don’t take it personally. When your kid is suffering it makes everything else in life stop - there is no such thing as propriety or giving them space. There’s only saving their life. And layer on that the genetic component. Did I make you broken? Did I give you defective genes? I have to fix it. I have to make it better. It’s my responsibility.  

What you’ll have to do with them is build healthy boundaries. 

For their sake (and yours) you need to demonstrate a sense of responsibility for your health. Unfortunately you can’t be the typical young adult, you do have to eat right, exercise, take meds, sleep right, go to therapy etc. 

For your sake, they will have to learn to trust you and be a fall back if you need help. They have to give you the space to do it on your own and accept that you may make mistakes... or more likely, the equilibrium may break by no fault of yours. I think this comes from education on how BP works and surrendering to the idea that there is only so much either of you can do to prevent an episode. They have to let the guilt and control go.

I would suggest you do a few things....

1) family counseling with someone familiar with BP - the goal would be to allow everyone to express and process how their feeling and create trust, forgiveness, and acceptance of the situation. Here is a great place to set clear boundaries.

2) set up a bipolar treatment contract. Usually this is for spouses but in this case I think it’s doubly good to do it with them. They’re invested in your health and are willing to step in. A lot of people don’t have that kind of support. Also, you don’t have to leave potential partners to figure this out. Now once you settle down and are ready to get married, it should shift to your partner.

3) talk to them. They are worried so just check in. I know it’s annoying. But you’re blessed to have your parents to annoy you. It may not feel like it now but one day they won’t be there. And you’ll miss their nagging, meddling, and parent crap.

So it starts recreating the reality and making it sound more like what it would expect to see.

None of this is you. Maybe if he were neurotypical you’d still have some of the disagreements because couples do disagree. But the way he goes about it. The way it’s hurts so specifically as it relates to your self worth... that’s the BP. Telling him he should word things so it’s clear that they’re your fault. Motivating him to defend himself against a non existent attack from you. Reminding him that he is awesome and everything that people tell him isn’t ok is just their jealously.

Headline: IT'S OFFICIAL: Kanye West is a billionaire 💰💰

Person: Love to see it.

Me: All this money. Can’t buy a friend to help him through his mental illness. This is why money and fame aren’t enough. I just hope he doesn’t end up like Whitney...

Person: I can't speak to any mental illness that he hasn't shared but he has his health and his family. Can't beat that.

Me: Definitely. He’s been open about it but also has gotten into various situations over the years where it seems there wasn’t anyone there looking out for him. That’s really my point. We can give accolades but real support is lacking. That’s all.

Person: I'm a real supporter. I'm a customer lol. But I don't know his personal life aside from that he has shared.

Translation: So long as he makes money no one is going to seriously look as his mental illness. They’ll laugh, joke, and buy his records. But no one wants to take on the work of helping an icon not become a statistic. 🤷🏽‍♀️

Ironically before my SO has his manic breakdown - we used to debate Kanye. He hated him and I always argued that the man is sick and needs support around him that won’t take advantage of his illness and milk it for PR and money, but actually lead him toward help and show him he can be loved outside of his mania."

BipolarReddit,fpf7z2x,t3_gd37n8,1588563986.0,"It’s not mutually exclusive. That is to say, emotional abuse can be because of character or because of illness. It’s a reason for it but not an excuse. That said, many people put up with emotional abuse from partners who are ill because they feel like it’s not the persons true intention and don’t want to unfairly punish them. But ultimately it is abusive behavior. No different that having a parent with Alzheimer’s insult you constantly when they aren’t themselves. In that situation people tend to think of it as a sad situation and rarely blame the person unless they were abusive before the diagnosis. 

The thing you have to ask yourself is “how do I do my best to live my life and treat people the way I truly believe they deserve to be treated?” If your taking medication, going to the doctor, working with you partner on treatment a plan, tracking your moods, getting exercise, have a good diet, don’t drink/do drugs... then you’ve done everything you can and no one has the right to try to shame you for your illness.

bipolar,fpbbq7c,t3_gcgxak,1588466406.0,"You’re right, nothing can ‘bring’ you happiness. You have to chose it. Everyday. It takes work to manage intrusive thoughts. You have to change the story you’re telling yourself and remember that you are not your illness. 

Some things you can do right now...

1) Resolve to manage your BP and it’s symptoms. We feel the most helpless when we don’t see a way to change the outcome of our situation. That means you need to take tangible steps to manage it. Put in place tools to make sure you’re taking meds, checking in with you doctor, and getting regular therapy. I also like to make sure my therapist has a clear understanding of what goals I have for therapy. It’s not just to vent but to also improve my thought life, gain coping skills, and create a tangible change in my behavior. Each of those are achievable and measurable and should be discussed aloud with your therapist.

2) Pray. Even if you’re not religious. Even if you’re an atheist. Prayer is not just a spiritual concept. The act of saying the things you want for yourself (to let go of guilt, find supportive people, do better everyday) speaks directly to your unconscious mind and gives it prompts to change your conscious behavior. I do believe in God and just as I hear my prayers, so does He. It’s remarkable how even some of the smallest things I’ve prayed about were handled within a day or two of prayer. It’s not going to make you magically skinny or rich or even take away the BP overnight but you’d be surprised how much it helps both physically and emotionally.

3) Do something. I mean things like take a shower, go for a walk, do burpees in your living room, learn a new dance. Movement get blood going, focuses attention, and improves mood by releasing endorphins. The sadder and more self loathing you get, the more you’ll want to just sit or sleep. Which actually makes you feel more down. Get out of the spiral and move.

4) Recognize some of this is BP thinking and some of it is reality. I say that in the sense that you’ll need to be able to have a thought, acknowledge it, and then choose whether you need to dismiss it and move on or if you need to act on it. If there are people you’ve hurt, and you haven’t made amends... you need to act on it. If you’ve already done that and you’re just ruminating, you need to release it. If you’re unemployed because of something you did, and now that we’re in quarantine you can’t look for a job. Then you have to let that sh*t go. Yes you made a mistake but in step 1 above you’re already doing things to help prevent it from happening in the future. Stuff happens. Accept that and you’ll learn to cope with absolute worst that life has to throw at you. I was laid off twice in two years by two different companies. It wasn’t even anything I had done, just the circumstances. I felt awful but I had to decide to not wallow. No medicine can do that for you. You have to do it for yourself. That’s why therapy and prayer are so helpful. They give you a means to release the negativity.

5) Accept that you were made for a purpose. All your flaws and weaknesses and all. Who you are on the inside has little to do with what you are on the outside, unless you let it. You were born uniquely equipped to handle the things that life has and will throw at you. But just because you’re equipped doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll reach you potential. That’s completely up to you. Choose now if you want to be all the wonderful things you were born to be. Or give up and lose. You cannot win and give up at the same time.

I believe you can do anything you put your mind to so long as you recognize it’ll take work to get it done. But you have to believe in yourself as well. And you have to be willing to fight that uphill battle to earn it. 

I’m praying for you. That you have clarity, comfort, and peace. That all the moments of the past you are frightened and ashamed of leave your minds eye and float away as distant memories. That you develop great coping mechanisms and a network of people around you who love you, accept you, and will protect you from the last by helping tryout find your bright future.

I’d challenge you to have an open mind and discuss with them why you don’t agree. If you still don’t agree with their assessments I’d suggest not changing anything for a few weeks and getting second opinions. Be sure to talk with a psychiatrist that knows bipolar well and has had many bipolar patients. Also speak to a therapist who had done the same. You can set up 30 minute consultations (usually free) with a new therapist and just tell them your predicament and ask how they would handle it. My concern is you have an illness that changes your perception of people’s motivations and can cause you to make more impulsive choices. So while you have every right to disagree with your course of treatment, we also want to ensure that it’s not the disease driving the push back.

BipolarSOs,fpak9nr,t3_gbt155,1588449908.0,"Depends on the person, if they’re medicated, if they’re properly medicated, etc.

Medication is intended to suppress the frequency and intensity of episodes. Some meds for some people almost eliminate episodes. For others it just makes them more mild and shorter duration. Hence the variance in timing when medicated.

Unmedicated episodes can last months (research has shown upwards of eight months to a year). As someone mentioned, rapid cycling or ultra rapid cycling (which many debate if it’s even possible to have) could be hours or days.

One suggestion, read the book “loving someone with bipolar” it has exercises where you both sit down and identify triggers and symptoms. If your symptom checklist is longer than “crap she’s overly excited about this” maybe you’ll be less inclined to suspect mania every time. Also it’ll give you tools to manage those symptoms when you do see them - which can help with any anxiety you may be experiencing when you suspect an episode may be coming."
BipolarSOs,fowpv8s,t3_g9zks6,1588124655.0,"It requires forgiveness. Which is a skill that very few people are taught. True forgiveness releases you from the trauma and lets in light where previously only the hurt and anger from the experience has lived. It’s a process that’s both mental and spiritual. And ultimately has nothing to do with the reason or excuse for why the person violated you the way that they did. It’s actually completely divorced from them - and all about you. Once you get there, it’s almost like a light switch in terms of how you feel about it. But that isn’t the end of the process. The next step is to unlearn all of the defense mechanisms you’ve built to defend yourself from being hurt by others. That can be a super long process but essentially starts with “am I acting out of fear or faith?”. 

Anyway the first part of the process is where the feeling of trust can come back, the second is where the acts of trust return. You can act like you trust now but really it won’t be genuine and will cause you more stress and pain - you have to get to the forgiveness first then it becomes second nature. 

In any case, I personally believe in forgiving everyone. However the depth of the actions afterward - ie keeping them in my life, is reserved for the ones who value my trust and love. 

Best of luck!"
BipolarSOs,foond08,t3_g8mqmh,1587942449.0,"I honestly don’t know that there is anything you can or should do if he’s refusing treatment. It’s not your responsibility to not trigger his unmanaged BP. That’s like a diabetic telling you to monitor their sugar when they refuse check their blood and take insulin. 

He’s got to do his part. It’s not fair to burn you out because he isn’t willing to face his diagnosis. This isn’t lack of insight - he knows something is wrong he’s just decided to be a doctor and name it himself. That’s denial. And if he loves you, he’ll do what he needs to overcome that. 

Don’t make this your problem. You cannot trigger a chemical imbalance in his brain. It doesn’t matter what look you have on your face. That’s just him trying to reconcile how he feels with whatever data is handy. He is going to feel that way no matter what until he begins to treat it.

Whatever you do, please don’t forget you’re not the cause or the cure. You can help, you can facilitate, but you cannot fix. So use that energy to take care of yourself. 💛"
BipolarSOs,folyr27,t1_folv75i,1587873746.0,"Yeah this is a part of the risk taking behaviors. BP can cause an inability to understand and more importantly internalize the implications of their actions. 

There was a story here where a guy took his young son to a barbershop, told him to sit tight, then went out on a drinking bender. I think he ended up getting into trouble and arrested that evening - with the kid still at the shop. Seemed completely rational and fine to him at the time.

BipolarSOs,fnng1s6,t1_fnkf0wi,1587091535.0,"I think it’s a few things....

They’re experiencing some very extreme emotional changes. We see a lot that folks who don’t have it controlled well often take these feelings out on the person closest to them. I think when you start to feel unhappy, often the first thought is “is it my partner?” We’re all conditioned to think our partners should make us happy. (Don’t get me wrong, some people do realize that you have to be happy on your own. But in general most of us do carry that expectation.) And culturally the idea of dropping “toxic” relationships is reinforced in even the most benign dating conversations. (I had a friend site being told, direct but politely, her breath was bad as toxic and dumped the guy)

This is also mixed with a tendency for them to experience paranoia and distrust. This tends to look like emotional and physical cheating accusations. Again it’s like “my partner” is the problem, the reason I feel this way.

Layer that with increased sex drive (which ironically shows up often when they’re being a-holes, so partners are less interested). Or...

Depressive feelings of self loathing, and a fear of making everyone else miserable. 

And decreased inhibition (increased risk taking). I mean how many times have you had a fleeting thought of running off with someone or selling your things and moving to Tahiti (House Hunters International really makes this one relevant)? Well now they have the thought and nothing, in their minds, to hold them back.

Idk, it just makes sense to me. I could be full of it lol."

BipolarReddit,fniixw9,t3_g1xdso,1586980793.0,I use the faithful counseling app - I like that I can just out thoughts in the chat and we can discuss them between telephone and video sessions as needed (and limited!). It really helps when I’m feeling like I need higher maintenance support.
BipolarReddit,fniirhm,t3_g1yfne,1586980706.0,"I don’t know if the chance is small that this is BP related anxiety and suspicion. As an SO, I was accused of emotionally cheating and there were zero guys I spent time with outside of my partner (and there are lots of similar stories on the SO sub). 

That said, if you think your partner is a loving, respectable person whom you can trust. Just ask point blank. And if you’re uncomfortable with her maintaining a plutonic relationship with a guy she’s previously been intimate with, then ask her to stop. It’s a completely reasonable ask. And a completely reasonable deal breaker. However, if you’re spending time obsessing, assuming she’s lying, or feel like she’s going behind your back - it might be time to assess if that’s coming from you. As a partner, those types of accusations hurt the worst when you’re faithful to someone who often times you have to worry may be doing just the same thing due to manic behavior. It really adds insult to injury. 

So tread lightly. If this is someone you really love, be vulnerable and give the benefit of the doubt. If you get hurt, so be it. But don’t be the one doing the hurting. You can’t control what other people did but you can control yourself. 

Best of luck."
BipolarSOs,fnihysw,t1_fnidnca,1586980312.0,"I say this with complete understanding... did you get them tested for BRCA’s?

I’m drawing the parallel to say that BP can be really intense, it can also be really mild. With treatment it can be managed and symptoms all but eradicated or it could be really volatile and ultimately take the persons life. Same as breast cancer. 

Genetics aren’t your fault or your partners fault. We all have something lying dormant that just needs the right partner for it to show up in our kids. Please don’t kick yourself over that. If you focus on the fear of it, that’s bound to show up in how you interact with your kids, how you view their behavior, and ultimately give them a sense of being broken or at least fearful of it. 

Give them love and support just as if any other potential mutation or defect were there. They’re still yours, they’re still wonderfully made, and they couldn’t have been anyone other than who they are.

You really did have your own truth that wasn’t just you deciding to be sucky, it was out of your control. 

Anyway, I just hope you don’t live in the shame of it. We’ve all done shameful things (most people won’t even admit it until they run for office or something and it gets dug up). We’re human. You’re human. Coming from someone hurt by this illness, it’s ok. You are ok. 

Learn from it, stay on top of it as if it were diabetes or an auto immune disease, and move forward.
