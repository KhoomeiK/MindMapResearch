As for your sleep schedule.. again, be gentle with yourself while you work on it and take it slow. Work on adjusting your fall asleep time an hour earlier every week, or something of that nature that works best for you. Small steps, big gains!"

But I still continued to smoke regularly, and definitely more often for numbing/coping vs enjoying myself. Last year I completely stopped for 3 or 4 months. I felt so good mentally. Then I started up again thinking it wouldn’t be a big deal, and I noticed how much it could trigger my depression, and honestly some psychosis. I’ve since come to terms with the fact that it’s just not the best for me. I do still smoke, but very little. Some days I don’t at all but otherwise I primarily only smoke to help me fall asleep at night. Or I’ll grab some for days that I physically need it to deal with headaches and nausea. I don’t know how much you use but i really believe it might be keeping you in a negative thought loop.

I also don’t know if it’s a bipolar thing, I’ve only recently been diagnosed (though I’ve wondered for a long time) so I’m not gonna act like an expert. But I’m also diagnosed depressive disorder, anxiety and ADHD. so for me, I’ve mostly contributed it to anxiety and ADHD. It’s like, if I don’t have somewhere I need to be, I don’t know where to go or why I should. I’ll even stay home hungry as hell because it’s just so much to leave and make decisions or go to a store. Most the time, I’m happy I did it afterwards.
I get nauseated often for a variety of reasons, but I’m learning that sometimes my body reacts with nausea when I’m anxious and makes me wanna avoid whatever. So tell that nausea (and anxiety?) to chill out and go enjoy yourself. Getting out, and being around others, can do a lot for mood improvement. And even if you decide you hate it, you can always go back home or try else where... but with being able to say you gave it a shot."

I was taking 10mg methylfolate for awhile and it seemed to improve things slightly. I hadn’t had those levels checked again after taking that supplement, and I’ve fallen off of taking them (mostly due to taking other meds/supplements — I guess I can only maintain so many at a time haha) but perhaps that could be something to look into? I also have low zinc, vitamin D & ferritin. You say your iron is ok so I think it’d be good to look into the others.

I’ve had partners tell me that they noticed my breathing would pause while I slept. I also notice I’ll “forget” to breathe during the day, some of it is definitely anxiety but not all. My father snores loudly and has been diagnosed with sleep apnea and has a CPAP. I’m on the fence about looking into a sleep study for myself, and felt like I couldn’t have sleep apnea because I don’t snore. But I never really feel rested, and I take adderall and still feel like i could pass out in the early afternoon. I did come across some article once that talked about central sleep apnea which doesn’t have snoring as a symptom. 

Also might I add that I agree with others to work on cutting out gluten. It’s hard (I fckn love bread!!) but feeling better is worth it. Plus gluten can cause issues with absorption of B vitamins!

Walking sounds too easy to really help, but it’s one of the best options that is both free and accessible! Either listen to something that helps calm you or makes you happy, or take in the beauty of life around you.

On another note, reading your post I can’t help but want to remind you of how strong you are! You constantly feel like relapsing but you don’t, and that takes immense amounts of strength!

So I replaced the bottom with some soil and put it back in the pot and thoroughly watered it. I feel like it took a bit for it to be happy again. Mine is in plastic pot but maybe yours needs more water being in terra cotta? Also consider vents or drafts. On occasion I still get a yellow leaf but not a lot like before!

adhdwomen,fdflvcd,t3_el2k5b,1578364716.0,"I was a high honor student all the way through to grade 12. School was easy for me for the most part... I mean, it was structured for me. Helps that I was pretty shy and quiet, and that my grades were how I got praise from my parents (I was 1 of 3 bad at sports but the 1 who did the best with school). Anything that I had to do or work on outside of school got harder as I lost the structured environment.
I only did like 2 years of college, still did good but definitely more challenging as the structure was a lot less. I changed my major just about every semester though, so I really only ever did basic gen ed classes. Never got a degree and it’s been like 6 years or so now since I stopped trying to make college happen haha. 

Because I did so well in school and was quiet, no one really worried about me being adhd; but lots of the symptoms were always there. I don’t think grades make a big enough difference with diagnosing, people are too different and adhd presents differently for everyone. Plus, why can’t folks with adhd just naturally be smart or good at learning?? My first therapist also told me I’m not adhd due to doing well with school.

Advice? Take care of yourself. Sleep is HUGE for me. As well as eating well and being hydrated. Physical activity is also really helpful. And if you’re able to, seek treatment! (And continue if you don’t get the help you need, at 18 my first therapist wrote me off so fast but my psychiatrist now has been amazing)

Aside from all that usual annoying-but-true advice: **self-compassion**. Seriously, that’s been a game changer for me. It’s not always easy, but it’s SO important and helpful.

My psychiatrist started me on dextroamphetamine and it was very clearly not right for me. My anxiety skyrocketed, I was so easily irritable and impatient. My friend’s dogs’ pacing made me lose my mind. I hyperfocused a lot more easily, but not on anything good lol such as it made my skinpicking worse, I had scabs up and down my arms 10x more than ever before. It made me feel insane. The bad stuff went away after I stopped taking it, I saw my psychiatrist again and he switched me to adderall.. nothing like that has happened again. 
My point is, you’ll know if it’s harming you more than it’s helping you. Trust yourself and speak up about your experiences, and try the next thing. It’s better to take the risk of a short term bad experience, than to never try to find what helps improve your life.
