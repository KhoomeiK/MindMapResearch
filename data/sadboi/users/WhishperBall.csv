AnxietyDepression,f910dzm,t3_e32f6q,1574980198.0,"Anxiety is part of fear, let's go into this together, this helped me I m sure it can help you if you pay attention now. Thinking creates fear, you either think about the past or future. And now the fear comes up when you think about it. Its an automatic response. It is from the past to the present. So as you are sitting now and you think about something that triggers the physiological response we call anxiety suddenly fearr is there now. You start having the effects of fear(anxiety), pupils dilated, you are ready to run or fight so the stress hormone is released to prepare the body). That's all the physical response happening from the psychological activation. Psychological or psychology is basicly thinking. What makes you you is what you thought, and what you think is an image memories the past that you think it's you. You're job, embaraments, fears, etc all that make up you (the self). So you are the thinker trying to stop anxiety  so you think anxiety us different from you. But by fighting it you think you are going to get over it. Wrong because you are activating the brain cells that elicit the stress hormone based on your psychology. So fear needs to be dealt with observation and understanding the mechanism of thinking which makes you.

You have to realize you are the prison, the trap. Not only intellectually which you logically recognize but also actually to find out what is thinking? And who is you? (the thinker) 
The root cause of this is ME(thinker) who is trying to be better, happy, not depressed, not anxious. But the fact is I'm depressed, anxious etc. We don't face the fact of it so we run away from it by the idea of becoming better or not depressed.
We are always thinking, then what is thinking in itself? If you find that out actually then there is a release of tension and energy. Then it's finished.
If you want to be free from something you must understand it totally with youe heart. Check out j krishnamurti on YouTube. It's a miracle if you really listen!!

But society is the self and the self is society. Therefore the anxiety, depression caused by society is the self. The controller who is anxious is trying to control anxiety itself. But there is only anxiety which is caused by the unutural ways of society and there is no controller.
The controller is a trick of thinking. Thinking is happening on its own. Its clear that we are society, culture the world. If we don't change, if the self(ego) is not seen and dropped which is the controller then we will be in constant effort and conflict with the world. That means we perpetuate society as it is by our actions and moving further away from nature.
The more you move away from nature the more problems arise. We are not meant to work for 8 hours under so much stress, under authority, trying to maintain social status and a social identity. We are not meant to be enclosed all day in factories, work work endlessly. Where is the rest? We don't rest at all in our heads, observe this right now, we are always thinking of our identity..."

To see exactly what you are, or or they only putting you models in your head with you questioning those models.. QUESTION THEM question cause it might be wrong!! The greatest thinkers of our time have questioned everything. Don't accept find out for yourself, this,. If you are different from anxiety, or are you that?
Go into it otherwise you will be a psychologist for the sake of getting money and you will not actually help the patient at all. You will only partially help them to get some money and that's the end of it.

psychologystudents,eqp3uit,t1_eqotfjd,1560195590.0,"Which are caused by thinking which is the past and the response of memories that create the self. And that self is shaped by the environment, parents, society tradition, school, gossips, bullying, thinking. All that create a center and from there all our action takes place, then from the self the depression, anxiety and various mental disorders are perpetuated cause it creates a lifestyle according to its past. There are various brunches and symptoms that psychologists try to deal with. But the root cause is never been looked at, cause we think by more thinking and more self improvement that can be ended.
It's obvious if you look at yourself since you are about to be a psychologist, that there is a division within the self. Which is the thinker and thoughts, me and---- my depression(as seperate). This duality exists as me being the subject of that. There is a division between the subject and object. The fighter of anxiety(me) who says I will fight it or do something about it. As though the fighter is different from that which he fights.
So the fighter fights itself, anxiety depression are being treated as illness and are  further being pushed away from the self(me) and we fight that. Which is the self perpetuating it's own past, giving strength to anxiety, depression etc.
Whereas if the self which is thinking is understood, realized then its over. Total psychological inaction which is the best action. Pls look at this this is very serious it can help many people and it can bring total revolution in psychology. If you understand this: check j krishnamurti he is saying something fundamentally real and truth I have seen it for myself and it makes sense.
The observer is the observed, the thinker is thought, the Depressed is depression. Check out the YouTube videos pls, it can help many people but you have to observe this for yourself. To find it out as an amazing discovery. It releases an energy and a tension which is unreal.
Pls really for the sake of humanity observe this, find this out. We need people that don't just accept the old methods of psychology. What if they are wrong?! We have to question our past otherwise we might perpetuate a fundamental ilussion which is a total mistake, the thinker and thought, me and - - - anxiety. Total psychological inaction which is the self stopping all movement all thinking!!! Then the self images, comparison, the past, the fight, effort, conflict between me and my depression.. All that comes to an end. Then the physiology comes back to normal.
Pls my friend check it out for the sake of the sufferers. Pls I have gone through this and I see this as a shattering truth. The observer is the observed, the thinker is thought."

Then don't use an alarm ever, let the body sleep it knows better, it's the inteligence of the body that wants you to sleep more. An alarm destroys that inteligence.
Yoga, going in nature, eating vegan or vegetarian food, cutting inflammatory foods like meats and dairy. Sun exposure, movement and actually listening to the body, when it's tired to rest.

A psychologist tells you what to do, krishnamurti tells you observe for yourself then you will realize psychologists don't know much either.
Psychologists are told what to do, read a great deal, but they don't actually observe themselves. It is a profession with high suicide rate and some psychologists have done crazy mental shitt.
When you think you know and are an authority of the patient then you make him into a child, disabled man, and they label you. They don't tell you let's go into this together, find out the root cause in this.

How can I do something when I don't have space inwardly.
I have been there before, what helped me is to observe the thoughts and give up, let go of trying to do something. Give up entirely any effort, give up motivation, give up the very same elements that are holding you back. Then nothing is holding you back.

If you could observe and contemplate why you think that, don't seek a cause or try to find an answer. Just ask yourself why do I feel that everything is meaningless, is it because I'm trying to fill this meaninglessness with meaning?
Isn't life on its own its own meaning, we humans try to fill the emptiness of our meaninglessness with some meaning. But again that meaning comes as a reaction to fill the void.
Then it stops to be meaningless. The self, ego(you) are trying to find meaning. Give up trying to give life a meaning, you can't, you may think you can but its like a replica of a lovely flower trying to mimick the actual flower.
Then you see life as a whole and the actual meaning is seeing the meaninglesssness of becoming someone, success, power, ambition. Those are the replicas, the egoic elements of the self that try to give meaning to life.
Life is it's own meaning, which is love,nature compassion, care for humanity.
