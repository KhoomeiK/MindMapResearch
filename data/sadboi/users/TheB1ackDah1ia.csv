bipolar2,f5kv4re,t1_f5kurbd,1572270375.0,"I break down and cry at work a lot lol. I just almost always work by myself so nobody sees.

I'm afraid of going and upsetting my parents. Or my boss. Or anybody really. Maybe I feel I'm not worth it? Idk I'm just scared. It'll be the first time I'm hospitalized.

Thats what I think I need though. A break from all the pain in my life. I have vices like sex and drugs but they are only quick fixes."

I'm doing my laundry for the first time in a month. I'm trying to get my mind healthier.

She chose to break up, and I can't let her choice break me down."
BreakUps,f454m5e,t3_djgoi8,1571365950.0,Yo I feel this on a personal level. Thanks for making me feel less alone.

bipolar2,f3ok73s,t1_f3oimuk,1571020142.0,"I understand. I always say an unlovable monster in my head.

Now that I'm high and outside of my head I am thinking I'm faking this. But I just don't see how I could be. This shit doesn't go through normal people's minds. It can't possibly."
bipolar2,f3ogf70,t1_f3ogabm,1571017229.0,"Yeah it's nothing like that, but more so like you said. That I don't deserve love. That the few people in my life would be happier without me in it. That I deserve to be punished for the things I've done. Be it self harm, not eating or taking a bath for days, etc."
bipolar2,f3ob3vc,t1_f3oasxe,1571013172.0,"I sometimes feel bugs crawling on me even when they aren't there, and like today all I can think of is how my ex probably fucking hates me and that she wants me to just leave her alone while she told me multiple times when i saw her for a second that she loves me.

But I can't shake it. That she must be putting pity on me, and she doesn't really believe that. She is just telling me what I want to hear.

Or that I would be doing my father a favor in killing myself, because I wouldn't have to financially depend on him any more, which I know isn't true. He would be heart broken. But the thing inside my head tells me how he would feel some relief not having to have such a fuck up for a son."
bipolar2,f3o9djg,t1_f3o98at,1571011838.0,"I've self medicated for like months now, and now after going through a break up it's almost making my depression worse.

When I'm sober I'm having uncontrollable crying fits, and when I'm high my paranoia gets worse and all I can think of is the shitty things ive done in my life."
bipolar2,f3o8y2s,t1_f3o8owa,1571011500.0,I wish I didn't have it. It's been screaming at me all day of the shitty things I've done and how I am so not worth what little life I have.

I used to have things like that too. More so lately I've just been telling myself how worthless my life is. That my ex might feel like it's necessary to go to my funeral, but that's all it is. A necessity. That she, nor my parents, or my brother would really care. In fact, maybe it will bring them a little peace."
bipolar,f3m3gjm,t1_f3m318o,1570982485.0,"I've felt that since I started reading about bipolar. If this is how I will be for the rest of my life, is it even worth it?"

bipolar,f3lwgwn,t3_dh4zfc,1570980231.0,"A fantastic film. From moment one I was crying at how much pain he was in, and his only source of outlet was an uncontrollable laughter he looked in pain with.

It was kind of eye opening to me how little I take care of myself mentally. How I push myself down. I want to get healthier."
bipolar2,f3lun7m,t3_dhbsp6,1570979771.0,"I haven't been clinically diagnosed yet either, but my mom has dealt with bipolar 2 and PTSD most of her life, and I exhibit the markers for bipolar 2.

I'm going to talk to my therapist about medication when I see him this week, but yeah, I'm in the same boat. I keep telling myself that I must be faking the emotions I am, and I just need to stop it, you know? But I can't, no matter what I do."
bipolar2,f3h72wh,t1_f3h3cou,1570919781.0,"I've stayed away from alcohol for most of my life because I could tell that it would just worsen the shit that's already in my head.

bipolar2,f3gz8u9,t1_f3gxfib,1570916817.0,"Yeah, it was a really really difficult time yesterday. Thankfully my job I am pretty much alone all day, so I was able to let myself go emotionally. I cried uncontrollably a lot yesterday.

I've felt a lot of catharsis coming on this group more.

I have a therapy appointment this coming Friday, but I might look to have something more permanent than when I schedule it. I didn't schedule one at all last week because I was too depressed.

Thank you for being here."

SuicideWatch,f3fs6rb,t3_d92gf2,1570901786.0,I feel this even to this day with my best friend who died in a car crash a few years ago. I feel so guilty for being alive with all this pain in my head while he was going to culinary school and doing something with his life.
bipolar,f3fr5ip,t3_dgxcpj,1570901337.0,"I'm sorry. I was in that same position yesterday. Take little steps. Sit up for a while. Try and make yourself go downstairs.

Sometimes if I'm really depressed and want to be in darkness I try to force myself outside and lay in the grass and take a nap. At least if I need to lay down, I'm feeling nature.

It's a real hard thing to get through, and I'm sorry you're there."

I guess I always just thought my brain was broken."
bipolar2,f3fa2jw,t3_dgg6my,1570893224.0,"An update on me today: I actually got some sleep last night, and I feel more clear headed. And my mom gave me a little bit of weed so I feel more outside of my head, able to process the things going on with me.

I made a therapy appointment for next Friday, where I will mention feeling markers for bipolar. I already told him about my mom.

I'm trying to continue to take care of myself. I ate something this morning. My laundry feels daunting. I've let it pile up almost a month now."
bipolar2,f3f9pqb,t1_f3bsmhd,1570892953.0,"There are a few times I've tried to reach out to God, and it made me angry when I still felt as much pain as I do.

My dad told me he reads a passage from the Big Book that AA uses, and it helps him to keep himself for mindful.

I think I will try some form of mediation. I used to do Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which was mine, but after a close friend died I got reallllyyyy depressed and stopped going."

I've lurked on this sub for a while, but lately I've felt like I can't speak to anybody irl, the only one was my girlfriend and now that she's gone it feels like I'm really alone."

bipolar2,f3clyr4,t1_f3br9om,1570825566.0,"Also my ex and I talk, and her doggo and I formed a great bond which I think is why I'm so hurt right now. It went from having them here all the time to now just being alone in my head.

I was really manic yesterday and obsessively texted her, which she got upset at me for. I feel like every step of the way I'm two moves from losing the person I care about most in this world from my life."
bipolar2,f3cle2n,t1_f3br9om,1570825379.0,"We have cats, but I don't really feel close to them. I'm going to adopt a doggo when I can show my mom that I'm financially stable in some way, as well as cleaning my room up I've neglected for so long.

I think the worst part is telling myself how me going away would make it easier for everybody else. How my parents would be better off without me around."
bipolar2,f3cl35g,t1_f3bu2p0,1570825281.0,I'm scared to go on medication. That I'm not going to ever be okay unless I'm medicated. I'm afraid I won't be able to live without it.
