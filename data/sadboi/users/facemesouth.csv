I’m not part of the anti-Beau club-I think he would probably act the way he does with or without TV but obviously could be wrong.

Of all of them, I do think Schena has gotten the worst “edits.” She owns that she falls too fast, buys too much for people, tries too hard with friends, but she’s also going through some substantial life stuff that they’re not showing AND had a show in Vegas that was barely mentioned?! That seems shady.

I liked Dayna but now that she’s made two really weird guy choices I just can’t. Maybe her taste in ladies is better?

I also think Ariana has been drug through the ringer and they chose to air it all-which seems like maybe good tv but bad mental health.

Don’t care at all about the cauchis and if they didn’t show back up I don’t think many would care? 

I hate to say that I don’t see Katie and Schwartz lasting unless he gets serious help but he won’t. I wish she’d have a session with Stassi’s little bro, let him analyze what she needs to fix, and then go on to a new show hosted by queen Ariana where she assists in placing women or minorities or LGBTQ in jobs in either beauty/consulting/or, my favorite idea is still the Ariana as the leader of an apprentice type show for bartenders.
