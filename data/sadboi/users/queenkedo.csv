I grew up in Sweden and when the flood wave hit Thailand me and my mum went to the Red Cross and wanted to help them collect. It was just before New Years and we were standing outside a super market collecting. People were going in to but fire works and would put 20-50kr in the collection tin. 

One of homeless guys in my home town went to recycle bottles (in Sweden you get money back for recycling bottles), bought himself some food and then proceeded to give me the rest of his money. This was above 500kr. 

It blew my 11year old mind and is affecting me to this day.
