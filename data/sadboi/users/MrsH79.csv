Stepmom,fp3b5hs,t3_gamala,1588276250.0,"It‚Äôs a difficult situation for you, but I am speaking through past experiences. Your partner has to say STOP NO MORE! You can be direct without being aggressive or unkind. The trouble is ever time BM acts out in anyway, I her mind there‚Äôs no repercussions. She has no right to attack you in anyway and it‚Äôll get worse as time goes on. I am not saying my experiences will become yours, but for resentment set in and I now harbour so much hatred towards my H. It‚Äôs heartbreaking as I/you have done nothing too warrant the emotional turmoil. I tried to rationalise with BM with you cannot rationalise with stupid and also with a woman that is insanely jealous of you. I am now able too look at it from a different angle, I detest her, to a point where I would love too slap her and shake her, but as I‚Äôm a girls girl, I also feel a little pity and empathy for her (that drives me insane) but it shows who the more grounded of the two of us is. I feel very sorry for my SKs their grasp on healthy relationships is very warped, they lack empathy, compassion and basic social skills, but it‚Äôs clear why. I also feel that my H is accountable there, as rather than parenting correctly and setting boundaries he‚Äôs tried to please everyone and keep the peace, sometimes confrontation done correctly is a healthy approach, burying your head in the sand does NOT work. Remember you‚Äôre not alone, hundreds of thousands of SPs are and have gone through this, you need to address it ASAP or it will effect you‚Äôre mental well being. This woman is unhinged! Approach it gently but firmly with your partner but stop rolling over, it‚Äôll destroy you emotionally and nothing or no one is worth that. I sound cynical but it‚Äôs reality. I truly hope that my H and I are able too work it out, but there‚Äôs a long way to go. Take care x"

My marriage has now ended, in week three, granted there were other issues but BM and SKs were relentless, your partner should not allow this, he should be laying down SOLID boundaries, which sadly she is crossing. On my end BM was relentless, constantly abusing me and I constantly fought my corner, sadly alone. My H and I are now communicating and I only hope it‚Äôs not too late, but for me letting go of the resentment I feel is difficult. I‚Äôm currently having weekly Skype therapy sessions to combat the emotional distress ghat I‚Äôve endured, my SKs are awful and mixing that with BM deranged behaviour was destructive.

stepparents,fnfr650,t3_g1dhfx,1586913751.0,"I‚Äôve written past posts of my journey as a step parent, my H ex partner (they were never married) is a complete nightmare. Initially she seemed comfortable with me being around her kids, but as time progressed I started to see the other side. My H did tell me that she was unreasonable but what he didn‚Äôt mention was how spiteful she truly was. It started with sporadic texts aimed at me and not warranted, it then became constant, for 7 weekends in a row she would text and ring me (drunk, wine drinker) asking me the most stupid questions and the vile things she said where questionable! I struggled to understand why a woman who was married with kids with current H invested so much time in me! I now understand, she is incredibly jealous of me, I noticed how she started to copy my parenting methods, I thought to myself develop an identity of your own! I represented everything she isn‚Äôt. Fast forward two years into my relationship we got married, what was supposed to be a happy time was turned into a nightmare, attacks on social media from her and her H and their whole family, texts, calls and the clincher the day after our wedding she sent the police to our home with false allegations! This was my breaking point, this was a year ago and now as I write this my H and I are now separating, I cannot move forward, I did for a long time resent my SKs, especially the eldest, I‚Äôve now moved past ghat but the anger I feel towards BM isn‚Äôt natural. I also hold my H accountable as I feel he‚Äôs spineless in regards too her! In my opinion BM not all (as I‚Äôm a BM with an ex) are problematic!

Explain that you feel extremely worried about his mental well-being, explain that you feel there is serious previous abuse, the GP is able to make an emergency referral with mental health crisis team, from there an evaluation will be carried out. Remember that these professionals are trained too see and spot signs of mental disorders. However if you feel that it needs emergency intervention, contact the mental health services in your area/district, express that you‚Äôre worried, express that you feel that he could potentially cause himself or others physical harm, emphasising that he gets pleasure from both emotional and physical pain. As hard as it be mindful that he is a child and that whatever has created this behaviour is deep rooted. Whatever the cause it is deep rooted.

I also made the suggestion for my BK as I feel it‚Äôs important for them to see bio parents co-existing, however on my H side the dynamics are vastly different..BM is a living nightmare and my SS are horrible at the best of times, I would never be able to sit at a meal in my own home with her. Ultimately you need to chat with your partner and work out a solution that fits for all..I always try and place my BK emotions above my own, but with SK it‚Äôs a different dynamic completely"
stepparents,f7m0wr1,t3_dwutu1,1573852087.0,"Reading this was incredibly refreshing and heart warming, I am a step parent and have a horrific relationship with my SS, it wasn‚Äôt always that way, it is primarily down to their BM..I only hope in time that the situation improves"
Stepmom,f7hzmvx,t3_du1fwm,1573750362.0,"Thank you both, my husband has made the choice to cut all contact, not a choice that I gave, I‚Äôm hoping he has realised the severity of the impact on both us as a couple and as individuals. In time I hope he can salvage a relationship with his BK, but for now self care and time to heal are a must...Living in hope x"
Stepmom,f784xoc,t1_f77tuj1,1573485332.0,"Thank you, as time progresses it worsens. Things are going from bad to worse, yesterday evening I discovered that my  H has started to self harm, I‚Äôve noticed severe decline in a few things and I now fear, that in the near future he will attempt suicide. In fairness he has made an appointment with the mental health team, hoping he follows through. I sometimes live in constant fear of losing him, it‚Äôs a vicious cycle and in truth it‚Äôs heartbreaking to watch, my H is an amazingly wonderful, kind gentle man and his heart is pure, there is no malice in him..Thank you for your kind words, hoping things will improve...."
Stepmom,f72oa8w,t1_f72l1to,1573371348.0,"Thank you for your reply, there are a multitude of issues, with the exception of what I‚Äôve explained, my H has turned to alcohol, he uses it as an emotional crutch, in truth he is an alcoholic (functioning) he has a good job and works very hard, but his alcoholism is a massive issue. He does not seem to have the strength to set boundaries, he is a ‚Äòpeople pleaser‚Äô and I am most definitely not. His children consider their step father as their father, the dynamics are complex, I have told my husband gently this morning that it is now choice time. It should never have come to this but I cannot continue. In regards to setting boundaries with BM, it can never happen, she is displaced, I feel she has some form of personality disorder, undiagnosed, she is pure spite, I dislike her on a level that I never thought imaginable. I truly feel breaking free is the right option, protect my own sanity, H will never make the changes, I try to support him, but it won‚Äôt happen. Thank you for taking time to reply, very kind as I feel very isolated"

stepparents,f6zki3m,t3_dtx06y,1573317870.0,"You are definitely not alone, the dynamics within our so called non existent ‚Äòblended family‚Äô are horrific! I am ready to leave my marriage, I stay because I love my husband dearly...It‚Äôs hard work dealing with an unhinged BM and her H and the rest of her family, I get it from all angles. The issues with SK are more than often caused because of those dynamics! In truth I do not think I will ever grow to love my SK and liking them is far reach, I associate them with negativity, it‚Äôs a vicious cycle"
