UnsolvedMysteries,fqcwjsn,t1_fqctch9,1589271376.0,"You're right, I definitely think that this has something to do with the Ambien and wine. I'm wondering about the toxicology report now."
UnsolvedMysteries,fqcwc90,t1_fqcli7y,1589271166.0,"With this in mind, I'm thinking maybe she stopped the car while driving, like maybe an animal (or person) was in the road and she exited the car to check it out? Cue to someone injuring her and drowning her in the river."

Youniqueamua,fphvdtn,t3_gdhfb0,1588628505.0,"Is there anything that says how much money they have to ""earn"" by selling product? I know it's a ridiculous amount but I'm curious as to how much these huns drop on their own product to go up a level."

bipolar,fo52hr8,t3_g5cr5g,1587516097.0,"Definitely a common thing amongst us. Especially during this quarantine, the isolation is so loud. You always have friends here, feel free to DM me, any of you, if you need someone. You're not alone."

askwomenadvice,fo4zicl,t3_g5p50y,1587514319.0,"Are you missing her, or the thought of her and the memories? It sounds more like the latter to me. I know especially in this time, it's easy to be lonely and remember only what made you happy and the good times you shared with her. Try to remember the hard times and the reason you two split as well. It's been 3 years since you've been apart, she may not be the same woman you loved. It's okay to miss what you had and reminisce, but you guys are no longer together for a reason."

Rape is traumatic for the victim whether they fight back or freeze, whether or not they are violently raped or threatened/harmed/etc in other ways. It is a heinous crime and should not have different subcategories. Rape is rape, and it's traumatic and horrifying."
AnimalCrossing,fntyj98,t1_fntxcht,1587251048.0,Correct. I bought 250 NMTs and used them all up looking for villagers.
AnimalCrossing,fnty4y2,t1_fntqrrx,1587250830.0,"Basically when no one exits conversations while the countdown timer appears, although you who pressed minus will leave, everyone still on that island will get reset, their progress won't be saved, it will be as if they had just arrived and nothing happened which is why this is not recommened"

Nothing bad with time travel for me so far, but you just can't participate in holidays (like bunny day on April 1st) until it's actually that day irl because it has to verify via internet. And as always, time travelling backwards will spoil turnips."

BPD,fk5kao6,t3_fgckt6,1583882252.0,"Oh my god, the last part absolutely. I actively avoid and get ridiculously upset and stressed at any discomfort or frustrations. I will quit video games, try to get out of confrontation, don't do work unless I'm asked, etc. I hate it."
BPD,fk5k35s,t1_fk22wrd,1583882131.0,Definitely agree. I've noticed my whole thing isn't abandonment but rather betrayal. It hurts so much worse.
