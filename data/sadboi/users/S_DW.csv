nursing,fpuroh4,t3_gfo2sr,1588921435.0,"Don‚Äôt give up! Time will pass by anyways so keep going. I am actually taking the same path as you. I am an LVN and I will be applying to LVN-RN bridge programs at a community college in the fall/winter. I do feel down at times because I cannot afford an overpriced private/accelerated program. 

I have had the study material to prepare for taking the TEAS test that‚Äôs required for the RN program for a month and I cannot seem to open it to begin studying so you are not alone. Especially disinterested these times are hard to focus but please keep going. Take an academic break if you have to, but keep going, we need you!! Thank you and happy nurses week to you! xo"

Maybe ask if you can stay overnight? They may decide to keep you depending on how you feel after you come out from recovery."

hysterectomy,f6labb3,t3_drs70k,1572934838.0,I had an LAVH on 10/31. Most women that I personally know that had this procedure and was successful went home the same day.  I at first did not want to stay overnight but my Dr. insisted she keep me to monitor for pain.   As much as I hated the idea I agreed to stay.  My surgery went well with no issues and let me tell you I am so very glad I stayed as I got so much rest. I don‚Äôt think I would of gotten that kind of rest nor comfort if I hadn‚Äôt stayed.  I wanted to stay another night just to retain such good sleep (anesthesia was heavy on me lol).   Overall I‚Äôm glad I stayed.  Was discharged the next day in the afternoon.

No issues peeing at all except I have to wait a little while longer to ensure the bladder is completely empty.   I was going to try a laxative but I think I‚Äôll be patient and keep taking the prescribed stool softeners.   I don‚Äôt want to over do it.  Thank you.
hysterectomy,f69lpt9,t1_f692yj8,1572743664.0,Thank you very much!!

Thanks"
