>""All they have are some good-looking electric cars that sell below cost""

>Tesla doesn't have unique technology, they are using the same lithium-ion technology as everybody else

>Every other manufacturer will introduce a 300+ mile electric car on the market (there will be no advantage)

 > zero-emission credits as a source of revenues (in the U.S.) and in Europe (deal with FCA) will dry too

 >Other manufacturers are forced to produce a certain amount of EVs, so they will do it, even at a loss, and then recoup the cost on conventional models (this is a major factor behind the rising prices on crossovers/SUVs and full-size pickups). For Tesla, it's a lot of EV competition.

>Another problem is too many employees at the plants (in particular at the Tesla Factory -Â currently closed)
