chemistryhelp,fqhm5ix,t1_fqexi0l,1589379799.0,"As a chemist myself, I really don‚Äôt see a way this could work at all. And as for your theory, pH is literally directly related to the concentration of hydrogen atoms in solution. It doesn‚Äôt matter how they got into solution, once they are there, it has the effect of lowering the pH. Total alkalinity is a measure of the concentration of all alkaline substances in the water. Since hydrochloride acid is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate and will not contribute to total alkalinity, but it will contribute to total hydrogen (therefore lowering the pH). 

On top of this, another common method of raising pH of pool water is to pump air into the water. The more you can increase its surface to air ratio, the faster the pH will climb. But turning the pumps off would have the exact opposite effect. You‚Äôre decreasing the surface area that water can contact air. 

The only thing I can think of is if they were continuously feeding acid into the circulation loop, so turning the pumps off would stop the flow of water through the system, therefore stopping the addition of the acid, but then adding HCl to the water anyway basically makes that step pointless. I honestly think there is something you guys are missing. Or some misunderstanding. Or even a bit of a practical joke. But I simply cannot think of a single way that this could possibly increase pH or alkalinity. Believe me, I‚Äôd love to know how if it is true!"

dating,fpu5wg7,t3_gf739g,1588905354.0,"I‚Äôve felt that spark only two times. The first time ended in disaster. Our first date was going to be a short (30 min- 1 hr) coffee date. 8 hours later, they kicked us out cause they wanted to close. The way he so openly teased me, but didn‚Äôt mind me teasing back. The friendly banter. I‚Äôm an INCREDIBLY socially anxious and shy person, so this was totally not normal for me. It quite literally ended up being the perfect relationship. For both of us. But after a couple months he got scared of his feelings for me and decided running away from them would be the best choice. But not just that, he actively cut me out of his life, even going as far as getting mad at mutual friends if they mentioned me. Long story though. 

The second was just a couple of years ago. My depression and anxiety had been getting worse and I had been failing or dropping basically every class I attempted. I‚Äôd be lucky to go to the first few classes, then stop going. But this class was different. It was such a shitty lecture theatre (super small seats really close together). I ended up noticing him a few seats down. Literally took my breath away. Butterflies in my stomach, the whole nine yards. His smile just melted me. The sparkle of his beautiful blue eyes was just perfect. Next day we sat in the same seats, a few empty seats between us. The prof often got us to discuss questions in pairs, so I was excited cause he was the only person near me and basically guaranteed to be my partner. Until some jerk decided to sit next to me. However, part way through the lecture, she suddenly got up and walked out. Left her stuff there and everything. So me and this perfect guy got to chat! He was such a sweetheart. So kind. Funny. Just such a genuinely awesome person. Next day, he came and sat with me and we sat together for the rest of the year. And believe me, for the first time ever, I went to the majority of lectures (I couldn‚Äôt wait to see to him every day). He‚Äôd even walk me to the library every day after class even though he needed to go in the opposite direction. He gave me his number so we could text about the class and everything. We were partners on our group project too. For the first time in 3 years, I did very well in a class. And it‚Äôs thanks to him, haha. And 2 years later, I STILL get butterflies every time I think about him. We still chat once in a while. He will text me out of the blue and see how I‚Äôve been doing. He checked in when COVID got bad. Actually went out of his way to find my new cell number. I really wish I had asked him out. But it‚Äôs difficult enough a task for someone as shy and anxious as I am, let alone being gay on top of it AND not knowing his sexuality. I know I will always regret it and remember him as ‚Äúthe one who got away‚Äù üòû. But he was such a sweetheart. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to ruin things.

chemistryhelp,fochcjh,t3_g6mbek,1587671339.0,"So, van‚Äôt Hoff doesn‚Äôt directly relate to concentration. It‚Äôs the relation of the number of moles of total solute that dissociate into a number of ions. It technically has nothing to do with the amount of solvent because it gives a ratio completely related to the solute and is constant for a given material (the van‚Äôt Hoff factor for NaCl is always 1.9). So the equation for a dissociation (salt in water, simple acids, etc), is;

i = 1 + a(n - 1)

i is the van‚Äôt Hoff factor, a is the fraction of moles of solute that dissociates, and n is the number of ions each molecule dissociates into (2 for NaCl because Na^+ and Cl^- ). It is commonly combined with the equation for an association to give a more simplified equation that is simply;

i = (measured conc)/(theoretical conc)

So, basically what you can do is use the van‚Äôt Hoff factor you have of 1.052 and calculate the ratio of how much solute actually dissociates to total solute, but you will need another relationship to figure out concentration. For example, if you know how much the solutions boiling point was elevated, and you know the eboullioscopic constant of water (0.512), you can calculate the molality of the solution, and then convert that to molarity. 

Hope that helps. Let me know if you need something cleared up, or if this wasn‚Äôt quite what you were looking for."

You‚Äôre carrying away the vapour, allowing more water to evaporate. Evaporation is an endothermic process, requiring input of energy. As more water evaporates, it takes more energy from the hot liquid, cooling it down faster)."

The problem is that in the extremely rare cases that we can find tissues that haven‚Äôt fossilized, they are so degraded that the DNA has essentially fallen apart into tiny chunks.

And because water is polar, the chloride ions have no desire to come back together as elemental chlorine (which would have a charge of 0 and be non-polar). On the other hand, mercury as a metal is happy sharing its electrons between each other and has no reason to split, so it remains as Hg2^2+ . Unfortunately it sorta comes down to experience.

Of course it‚Äôs a fine line. Obviously getting fired for not working well, even if you feel you were, is not necessarily wrongful termination.

Whatisthis,fnjzzco,t3_fysu1d,1587011130.0,"Ok. I definitely should have thought about this so I was sorta right in saying I‚Äôd feel stupid. But I finally figured out what it is.  

This is a laser intracavity etalon. What it‚Äôs used for is to tune a laser to a specific wavelength of light. It does this using a phenomenon called Brewster‚Äôs angle. Basically, when light goes through a dielectric material (I will come back to this in a bit), if it passes through the material at just the right angle, a specific wavelength of light will exit, polarized, and with no loss to reflection. Basically all other light gets refracted or reflected off, and the wavelength you want makes it completely through. The metal panel thing is to stop light that comes off the prism so you aren‚Äôt just ‚Äúspraying‚Äù laser everywhere, which can be dangerous. This would be mounted to the end of a laser facing out. The prism‚Äôs angle can be adjusted so that the angle the laser hits it changes, which selects for a different wavelength because each wavelength of light has its own unique Brewster‚Äôs angle. This is what clued me into what it was. I noticed all of the adjustment screws. As for the canister? Well one of the problems with this type of etalon is that the prism needs to be a dielectric material. So the prisms are made out of materials like barium borate. These materials need are highly hygroscopic and thus highly sensitive to humidity in the air. If the air is too moist, or temperature gets too low, condensation can form on the prism which permanently damages the crystal. That canister would have been had a  layer of a desiccant like silica, or calcium carbonate, or calcium chloride at the bottom and when the etalon was not in use, it‚Äôs placed into that canister and sealed so that the prism stays in a low moisture environment. This one would select for wavelengths in the UV range."

As for the ICP, do you have a particular brand or model of ICP-OES? And any features that need to be included like the graphite furnace? Also, it is kind of more a standard practice to call the technique ICP-OES. Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy, rather than Atomic Emission Spectroscopy. One of the big reasons is that the acronym AES is already in use for the technique called Auger Electron Spectroscopy. If you‚Äôre doing this for a school project, you might as well know what it‚Äôs currently called. I looked up the cost of an Agilent 5110 SVDV and it‚Äôs about $108,000 USD. It‚Äôs an overkill instrument for sure, but ICP is an expensive instrument to buy, and super expensive to run as well. If you‚Äôre needing total costs, the cost of running an ICP instrument is significant enough that you should definitely include cost of liquid argon. Just the dewars alone cost a couple thousand dollars, and if your gas supply company doesn‚Äôt rent them, you‚Äôd have to buy at least two of them so that one can be filled while the other is in use. Then the cost of the argon is VERY expensive (up to $6 per cubic metre, and one dewar will hold about 160 cubic metres of argon, which would last on average one week depending on how much you use it, but will constantly be depleting whether you‚Äôre using it or not.)

OrganicChemistry,fmo4w91,t1_fmnnjh5,1586245488.0,"But it does look like it‚Äôs touching the bottom. What you‚Äôre effectively doing is measuring the temperature of the hot plate. Not so much the water bath (which is what you want to be measuring). Now since you‚Äôve got ice in it, I‚Äôm guessing the hot plate is off? Is this just a really exothermic reaction, or what exactly are you doing here??"
chemistryhelp,fmduqak,t1_fmca09v,1585978577.0,"No no, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether the temperature is higher or lower. Delta t is ALWAYS the final temperature minus initial temperature. If the final temp is lower than initial, you just end up with a negative value. 

How exactly does that answer not make sense? It is literally well within a measurable temperature range. 
However, it IS incorrect, I‚Äôm just curious what exactly your reasoning behind that thought process is. I found my mistake though, and your answer is actually correct. And I also see what went on with your equation as well. Delta t is always final minus initial. But because the initial temp was higher than the final temp AND you swapped them AND you didn‚Äôt include the negative sign out front, the two mistakes cancelled out. That won‚Äôt always happen however, even in other situations where the water is getting colder and the copper is getting warmer. The reason the negative sign is in the front is because if your copper sample is gaining energy from its surroundings, Q(copper) = -Q(surroundings) indicating the flow of energy towards copper. Obviously if it were the other way around, the negative would be on the other side. In many cases you will get the same answer doing it the way you had, and it may even seem pedantic, but it definitely is not good practice and I can definitely assure you from years of tutoring and TA‚Äôing, there DEFINITELY will come a time where having those two terms swapped will introduce a sign error and mess up the answer.

Now, the reason the temperature change is so small is, again, due to the high heat capacity of waters. It‚Äôs able to hold a lot of energy and expend it with little change on the temperature. Think about what happens if you add one single ice cube to a drink that‚Äôs at room temperature. The ice cube just melts and you‚Äôre still left with a room temperature drink. You need to add a handful of ice in order to make an appreciable change in the temperature. And still you‚Äôve only dropped the temperature down to maybe 10-15 C. Plus you‚Äôve got a lot of water compared to the amount of copper (more water, more energy). Because of the much lower temperature of the copper, the same affect can be seen with a smaller sample."
chemistryhelp,fmd34ub,t1_fmasb56,1585958278.0,"Actually, it does, even for non-metals.  For example, in a molecule like methane (CH4), hydrogen has a 1+ oxidation state and a charge of 1+ as an ion (its oxidation state is always 1+ and it‚Äôs charge is always 1+). Likewise, carbon has a 4- oxidation state, and a charge of 4- as an ion (this one is not always the same however). Oxidation number will always be the charge of each element as if they were individual ions (keeping charge balanced in the molecule). 

Another example would be CO2. Oxygen as an ion always has a charge of 2-, and it‚Äôs oxidation state is always 2-, however, this time, carbon‚Äôs oxidation state is +4 and its charge is also +4. 

I purposefully didn‚Äôt word it like this originally, but oxidation number is LITERALLY the elements charge by definition. Oxidation states are just a measure of the number of electrons an element has."
chemistryhelp,fmc20ke,t3_fu7r8y,1585937419.0,"Ok. So a couple things. First, I think you got a bit ahead of yourself at the beginning. Rather than jumping straight in, think about calorimetry in broader terms; the exchange of energy. So copper is gaining energy, and both the water and calorimeter are losing energy (assuming the water and calorimeter were in thermal equilibrium). In this case, you would have the following;

Q[Cu] = -(Q[W] + Q[Cal])

In your equation, you missed the negative sign.


Next, what is the condition for the 0th law of thermodynamics? At equilibrium, all of the temperatures will be the same. So therefore, your FINAL temperatures of EVERYTHING will be the same. You got this correct for delta(T) for copper, but you got it backwards for water and calorimeter. Remember, delta T is final minus initial. Therefore, your equation should have looked like this (left variables unlabelled for clarity, but based on above, it should be clear what I‚Äôm talking about);

mC(x - Ti)[Cu] = -(mC(x - Ti)[W] + C(x - Ti)[Cal])


Therefore we have;

(15.9g)(0.385J/gC)(x-(-20C)=-[(85.0g)(4.184J/gC)(x-22C)+(1.8J/C)(x-22C)]


After simplifying we have;

6.125J/C(x)+122.5J =-357.44J/C(x)-7884.48J

Rearranging to get like terms on the same side;

363.565J/C(x) = -7701.55J

And solving;

x = -0.0472C to correct number of sig-figs taking initial temperatures as constants. This makes more sense because water has a very high heat capacity, and copper has a high thermal conductivity, so it just sucks that heat right up. Now I just hope I didn‚Äôt make a stupid mistake somewhere, lol. Hope this helps!

Also, TMS isn‚Äôt really added to solvents anymore or used as a standard. Modern NMR instruments get better calibration by locking into and referencing the solvent peak (especially because the TMS shift has been found to be slightly temperature and concentration dependant), that is why it asks you what solvent you used. It‚Äôs also fairly volatile and doesn‚Äôt last very long in NMR solvents. Plus, it‚Äôs usually only added at a concentration of 1% anyway, so it shouldn‚Äôt be this intense.

chemistryhelp,flyw1b6,t3_frxlz8,1585610253.0,"I believe it would be inner-sphere. My reasoning is that first, given the slow speed, it makes more sense that the transfer of electrons would take place via the inner-sphere mechanism, which is much slower than outer-sphere due to the necessity of coordinating the interaction of two separate complexes and a bridging molecule and transfer through that bridge, rather than the direct transfer between metals. Also since the en ligand, being bidentate, is relatively larger than a monodentate ligand, the inner metal centres can‚Äôt interact directly as easily. Outer-sphere transfers also tend to happen quite quick. Also, complexes of [Co(en)3] are commonly in the form of chloride salts, so in solution, chloride ions make very good electron bridges for inner-sphere electron transfer. 

Cool fact (and small world I guess). Henry Taube was the man who discovered the inner-sphere mechanism of electron transfer and he won the Nobel prize for it. I actually go to the university that Taube received his BSc and MSc from. And to this day, he remains the ONLY Saskatchewan born Nobel prize winner.

Also, you‚Äôll need a rubber bulb for those serological pipettes (in the two metal canisters). You‚Äôll need something to actually draw liquid into the pipette, so rubber bulbs (a bit smaller than a tennis ball) are used. 

-you‚Äôve grabbed two variac‚Äôs (the big knobs by the bottles on the back right).

If you can find any heating mantles, you might wanna grab them. They‚Äôll be white, canvas, cup shaped things with a cable coming out. It plugs into the variac and heats up round bottom flasks. 

-is see if you can grab round bottom flasks of various sizes, and cork rings (if they have RB‚Äôs, they‚Äôll have either rubber donuts or cork rings that are used to keep RB‚Äôs from rolling around). 

-condensers! Especially reflux condensers (the cooled ones where water runs through the coil), and Liebig condensers (the simple straight ones). Also the tubing. You may need to get a pump to circulate water through them, or attaching a hose barb to a water source.

Stop taking people out simply because they swiped right or left too many times. It makes me wonder how many really awesome people I‚Äôm missing out on simply because Tinder‚Äôs stupid algorithm. Tinder used to be awesome. But it sucks now. It‚Äôs all about making money and they could not give a single fuck about whether you actually find someone or not.
chemistryhelp,fkm73fy,t1_fkkavh0,1584322414.0,"The acid is acetic acid (CH3COOH). This is a bit more tricky than what you think. Without knowing much about either solution, it‚Äôs difficult to get a very accurate estimation of pH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so the amount of acid that contributes to the pH is dependant on its pKa as well as presence of any other sources of protons. Also, if the soy milk reacts with the acid, that will affect the pH. There are just too many variables to make an estimate with such a small amount of information."
whatisthisthing,fkdcvtw,t1_fkd8ub8,1584074534.0,I have a friend who has something like this in their house! So. Fucking. Cool.
AskReddit,fkco4jk,t1_fkaiu2z,1584057300.0,Awe you‚Äôre an asshole. Now it‚Äôs stuck in my head üò≠
aww,fk6jknt,t1_fk5v5un,1583904114.0,YES!! SAME!!!!
chemicalreactiongifs,fk5m5m6,t1_fk4ppdq,1583883348.0,"Thank you! Haha as a chemist, I literally feel like banging my head against the wall trying to explain that something is safe. Good ol‚Äô Dunning-Kruger..."
chemistry,fk2k2rd,t1_fk2jglh,1583802771.0,"I‚Äôm dying üòÇ!!! Tosses it‚Äôs toys! Haha I actually didn‚Äôt think about that, lol. I‚Äôve definitely worked with columns like that where if you do much as think about air in the lines it‚Äôll shit the bed. Haha but pouring in definitely would mix up enough bubbles to cause problems if your degasser isn‚Äôt in top shape, and your column is a whiny bitch. 

Hahaha, and to be fair, you‚Äôd be shocked at some of the common sense that slips past people. Even I‚Äôve done stupid shit where I‚Äôve wanted to jump off the nearest bridge because of how simple the solution was compared to how difficult I was making it, lol."
chemistry,fk2ij21,t1_fk1rsrm,1583801814.0,"Hmm yeah, I can see it now. That would be hella frustrating. Although you do realize you can just top up the bottles before they empty completely without removing the lines, right? You don‚Äôt even have to stop running or ramp down or anything. No air gets into the lines, and you don‚Äôt even lose time running samples. I used to keep a 4 L bottle with my prepared eluent beside the HPLC and when there was about 100 mL or so left, I‚Äôd top it back up. Then you just prepare more once you fill the reservoir bottles the last time.  

Haha but man you made it sound worse than that üòÇ. I seriously thought you were making meth or something, lol."
chemistryhelp,fk2hh9b,t3_fg2c69,1583801164.0,"Your best bet is going to be spreading it out thinly in a Pyrex baking dish and putting it in the oven at no higher than 200 C. It‚Äôs fairly important you don‚Äôt try to speed things up by cranking the heat. That‚Äôs how you‚Äôre gunna blow yourself up. Potassium nitrate‚Äôs melting point is around 335 C, so you won‚Äôt be anywhere near the melting point. I suggest storing it with silica gel packets. While KNO3 isn‚Äôt THAT hygroscopic, it still will absorb moisture from the air."
chemistry,fk1fo1h,t1_fk1f61x,1583778719.0,"YES!! Haha I may or may not be a pyromaniac, lol. Which may or may not be a good thing considering I work with pyrophorics. 

But OMG THAT VIDEO WAS MAGICAL üòç! I would give anything to see 20,000 lbs of sodium being dumped into a lake! Although I‚Äôm pretty sure it would be less than legal these days..."
chemistry,fk1f3gn,t1_fk1eri6,1583778384.0,I think I just found that same video!! I actually haven‚Äôt seen it yet so I‚Äôm about to watch it!!
chemistry,fk1ek07,t1_fk1ecm2,1583778067.0,"I‚Äôm gunna look for the video, but there was a guy who threw a couple kg block of sodium into a pool, lol. I‚Äôll post the link if I find it. 

And yeah, this was basically Chernobyl all over again. Just a whole bunch of stupid mistakes that added up to one extremely dumb teacher."
chemistry,fk1e1zx,t1_fk1dcum,1583777773.0,"Oh totally! What I meant is essentially a large piece on the surface would cause a similar effect on the glass as a smaller piece submerged. If that made sense, lol ü§î. But there totally is a size that I‚Äôm just not going to go larger than for obvious reasons üòÇ. It might be hella cool, but I certainly like having all of my fingers, lol."
