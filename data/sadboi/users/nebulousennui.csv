He texted the other day asking for pictures of our kid, I asked husband because I was feeling guilty, he said no. I was down, but ultimately he was right. 

Your wife needs therapy. Parental abandonment is a hard thing to face, and it was only a couple years ago I was able to come to terms with cutting my dad out almost a decade ago. Your wife isn't an AH for wanting a dad. She's a bit of an AH for calling you one. But try not to take it to heart. There's a good chance that all she wants is a dad. It sucks massively to not have that, especially in situations like these. I think a good therapist is a great place to start to try to heal some of those wounds.

JUSTNOMIL,fhjp1zu,t1_fhjjj6k,1581651730.0,"Yeah, I'm learning a lot of people have. Druggie Diva's family might suck, but my friends overall understand. I do have one friend who has told me to tell her I love her cause she's the only mom I'll have, but I know it's because she doesn't want me left with any possible regrets, and does actually respect my choices. She's my friend, not Druggie Diva's, and so she's more concerned with making sure I'm going to be okay. 

There really isn't anything to say though, so I thanked her and plan to keep up NC until the bitter end."
JUSTNOMIL,fhjj6q0,t1_fhjib8l,1581647526.0,"Thanks. I know it's up to me to do the heavy lifting, but it's nice to know people care. Druggie Diva's family is mostly comprised of terrible people, I'm a little tired of shouldering the blame for her problems. 

My new psychiatrist found a good med combo for me though. He decided to put me on something for PTSD and its helped a lot. At least there is that."
JUSTNOMIL,fhjht67,t1_fhjhip8,1581646561.0,"Thank you. I miss when we were kids, because she listened then. Adulthood sucks. I don't want to go back to being a kid, but I'm not any happier with what adulthood has had to offer."
ChronicPain,fhjc6gi,t1_fhj9wx1,1581642556.0,People can be terrible sometimes. I'm sorry that happened to you.
ChronicPain,fhiytxh,t3_f3dr3s,1581634607.0,"This is why I won't apply for one. As it is I've already had a woman with a very full cart hit me for walking with a cane, and then sneered at me me I stared at her. Normally I'm confrontational but her expression was so ugly it killed a part of me.

ETA autocorrect sucks"
JUSTNOMIL,fhdzyay,t1_fhdzsf9,1581509249.0,"Thank you. She really didn't. I've been having bursts of strong emotion, like crying and asking why she couldn't love me, but I'm mostly just apathetic. She knew what she was doing thr whole time, she knew the risks, and I'm not her keeper. I'm too old to even begin to take that mantle up again."
JUSTNOMIL,fhdo5er,t1_fhdnvq3,1581493527.0,Thank you. I'm working on it.
JUSTNOMIL,fhdkzij,t1_fhdksq6,1581489904.0,Thank you. I appreciate that.
JUSTNOMIL,fhdij38,t1_fhdie6s,1581487448.0,Thank you. I think what I miss is the chance to have a mom. But I knew a long time ago I wasn't ever going to get that.
JUSTNOMIL,fhdgxlm,t1_fhdgbhs,1581485981.0,"I feel like it's my fault, even though it had nothing to do with me. I only ever wished she would get better. And it's a bitter pill to swallow knowing that any reconciliation she'd want would be for her benefit."
JUSTNOMIL,fhdfnjz,t1_fhdemh2,1581484882.0,"That sounds hard too. I'm sorry. 

And thank you."
JUSTNOMIL,fhddg5q,t1_fhdd8vm,1581483135.0,"Thank you. I'm doing my best. Currently recovering from pneumonia so timing kind of sucks, but I'm just going to do my best to keep on keeping on. Luckily I have school to keep me busy right now, and my friends are super supportive."
MadOver30,fhcw44x,t1_fhcrwy2,1581472093.0,"That's my issue, helpful as it is I'd like it to be my choice. I understand people get so sick they can't consent, but that doesn't mean it's an ideal situation."
AskReddit,fhagsjf,t1_fhaawol,1581409830.0,"I don't know why, but you reminded me of my friend and her siblings, who once got into a fight over who was cumming in the toilet and not flushing. Spoiler; it wasn't the lone brother. It was dear old stepdad. Allegedly. 

Though hearing my friends brother exclaim he used a tissue like a normal person was the absolute height of hilarity."
AmItheAsshole,fha07uh,t3_f1v41u,1581393791.0,"NTA. It kind of pisses me off schools still do things like this. Granted I'm as old as the hills now, but back when I was in elementary school I had a medical exemption for snacks, as I have type 1 diabetes, and I was supposed to eat one during last recess. Well I was the cool kid to hang out with then, because the kids who didn't want to play would just hang out with me in exchange for snacks lol. Well this one teacher got all uppity and threatened all kinds of stuff if I didn't throw my food away, despite all of us saying that I needed it. She accused us of lying, of course, and made me go into the classroom to throw it out. Unbeknownst to me the other kids went and told our teacher, who made sure that other one didn't bother me again. 

But ffs its food/water. I get not wanting kids to abuse privileges, but that policy is going to make someone sick."
mentalillness,fh8ehgg,t1_fh81ljh,1581358024.0,Oh I know. I wish others knew that too though.
mentalillness,fh6o0kn,t3_f1boly,1581302191.0,"That I don't choose to go manic, that I don't choose to be depressed, that I don't choose to have panic attacks and flashbacks, and yes I need my meds to manage all this."
BipolarReddit,fgut496,t3_f0g3m8,1581128823.0,I let my loved ones keep me informed of what I need to know. They're pretty good judges of what they should/shouldn't pass on.
AmItheAsshole,fgrvy52,t1_fgrvwcr,1581059634.0,Its one of the more hilarious euphemisms I've run across lol

Still weird though. OP you're NTA. That's a weird thing to get upset about."

AskReddit,fgoax73,t3_ezfc4m,1580964262.0,"Yeah well I don't like me either so welcome to the club.

And then they get mad at me for disparaging myself. Like lol wut."
JUSTNOMIL,fgo7f2d,t3_ezbaag,1580961630.0,"Your husband has a job to support you, not her. I do understand feeling upset, it's been over a year since we cut contact with my in laws and my husband is still greatly bothered. Honestly he's probably never had to stand up to her before, and it can be a shock. But he did the right thing."
AskReddit,fgkbyyv,t3_eynu3k,1580862022.0,"This is dumb but money I spend on myself. I'm so used to going without that I have panic attacks when I need something. Like the recent issue with a hoodie and some long sleeve shirts I just had. Its dumb because there isn't a reason to suffer, but I'm so used to having nothing/giving up my comforts for others that I struggle to put myself first. I'd rather spend it on household expenses, or save it for ""just in case"" than spend it on me."
AskReddit,fgkaiuu,t3_eyskct,1580861074.0,"Afternoons spent playing Summer Games on the Commodore 64 with my dad. He is a massive asshole, but he never once felt that video games, sci fi, and fantasy were just for guys."
