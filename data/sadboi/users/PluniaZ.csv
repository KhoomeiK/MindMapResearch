Christianity,fk7gfn4,t1_fk7clqu,1583935923.0,Catholics call it an ecumenical council.
Christianity,fk75btn,t3_fgv9yb,1583928143.0,"Vatican II was an ecumenical council of the Catholic Church called at the Vatican in Rome from 1962-1965 to continue the work of the First Vatican Council 70 years earlier, which had been stopped due to the Italian invasion of the last vestiges of the Papal States in 1870.

Vatican II continued Vatican I's work on ecclesiology (the nature and structure of the Church), and was also expanded to address topics that were of concern to the Church and society at large in light of the tumultuous events that had overtaken the world in recent times (two world wars, the end of the old conservative ruling structures, decolonization, the Cold War, etc.).

You can find all the documents of Vatican II here: http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/index.htm

Some people criticize the council because they care deeply about the Catholic religion and don't want to see it change. This is a natural reaction and has happened in response to many other ecumenical councils in the past (e.g., there was a massive, enduring movement to bury the Council of Chalcedon in the fifth century). But over time the Holy Spirit shines the light of wisdom on Jesus' people and gathers us into unity."

In contrast, the historical origin of Christianity consisted of scattered groups of people across the ancient Mediterranean who disagreed vehemently with each other about relatively minor details (e.g., circumcision, did Jesus have a physical body, what day to celebrate Easter), but all agreed that Jesus rose from the dead.

So you can be a Christian and believe the historical origin claims of most other religions to the extent they are based on physical observation (i.e., you can believe that Moses wrote the Torah and Mohammed wrote the Qur'an), but you can't be a member of another religion and accept the historical physically observable claims of Christianity (that Jesus rose from the dead).

All his transgressions which he has committed will not be remembered against him; because of his righteousness which he has practiced, he will live. Do I have any pleasure in the death of the wicked,” declares the Lord God, “rather than that he should turn from his ways and live? (Ezekiel 18:21-23)

theology,fhpsshz,t3_f4drtf,1581794682.0,"Transubstantiation in the Middle Ages was expressed in modes of thought (Aristotelianism and Platonism) that by the time of the Reformation were becoming increasingly outmoded. The Renaissance had opened Europe to types of learning that were considered by many (even in the heart of Catholic Italy) to be superior to the decadent scholasticism of Paris universities asking how many angels were dancing on a pinhead. This is a caricature but it captures how many of the learned class felt at the time. And the trend in society over the next several centuries was away from scholasticism and Aristotelianism and toward the rationalism and empiricism of the Enlightenment.

But many Catholic scholars dug in their heels and relied excessively on the language of scholasticism to express the meaning of transubstantiation. ""Substance"" has a special meaning in Aristotelianism, referring to the essential characteristics of an object that cannot change without the object changing into something else. So a Catholic would say in the case of the Eucharistic bread that its substance changes into the substance of Jesus while it's appearance remains unchanged. In the new Europe of the 16th and 17th centuries, such a distinction was considered nonsensical, and all subsequent generations of philosophers and scientists have largely abandoned this Aristotelian approach to thinking about things.

As a Catholic today, I believe a lot of the Aristotelian jargon can interfere with conveying what we mean by transubstantiation. All it really means is that the bread and wine are Jesus even though to all outward observation they look like bread and wine. As for how this can be, it is simply a mystery.

On top of this, we are all naturally skeptical of miraculous claims, and the idea of eating another person is naturally revolting. But with the discarding of the rational systems that had defended this doctrine in the Middle Ages, non-Catholics after the Reformation had little reason to adhere to the doctrine."
