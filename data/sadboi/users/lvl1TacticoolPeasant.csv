For a long time I couldn't fight back against the intrusive self destructive thoughts and would break down, now, it only ever gets to be annoying. I practiced jumping this big fucking hurdle in my life by checking my thoughts in with people if they'd have these conversations with me. I used to share my disturbing thoughts without a filter, it would lead to friendships breaking and a lot of confusion and misunderstanding from everyone around me, but now that i have plenty of practice with it, it's something better for me in my life. Now I have real world feedback, I know what reoccuring thoughts aren't true or beneficial now and can move on with my life. So it's better to at least try to express it than to break down another time and go nowhere."

schizophrenia,eys8qbr,t3_cyeg1a,1567390407.0,"In my experience being on meds has its pros and cons, and being off meds both have their pros and cons. I'll explain, but it'll take a while to pull all the pieces together in a cohesive way and will sound like rambling for a bit, but it all matters. I'll start:
During my first psychotic episode which wasn't anything horrifying at all, I had a profound 'spiritual awakening' experience as any new waver would call it, just all of a sudden out of the blue and hit me like a ton of bricks, and for four days straight it was the most awe inspiring and beautifully profound experience I could have ever possibly imagine having, nothing in my life tops it thus far.

For four days straight on from the point I had this episode I felt interconnected with a divine presence that I only just recognized was actually with me always even though I didn't recognize it ever before, the presence poured out love in infinite abundance to me and everything I was doing the presence was happy with me, the presence drowned out all negativity that entered and o ccured to me as I communicated with it, the experience gave me infinite depth to my emotions and answers to all my questions, wanted to protect me and to have me explore everything I was curious about with sort of like a childlike whimsy, like he wouldn't give me the answers straight, he'd make me think almost just to peak my maximum enjoyment and fulfillment of coming to any understanding I was curious about. I came to a place in my mind where I was in awe, crying tears of joy over often thought as mundane natural occurances that go by mostly unnoticed because of the scale of time we all experience, such as being aware of the dirt rocks and trees having souls that have objectives and purpose and aspirations of their own on a scale I can't comprehend anymore. Everything was always too subtle to really notice before this experience, but after that I really believe its all there. I felt a connection to everything like in an array of patterns dancing majestically with eachother  Experiencing that made me quite dysfunctional in keeping myself fed most of the time, and I couldn't communicate with others about anything I was going through because I was struck with such dumbfounding awe and bliss, I just couldn't talk any sense which made me actually very uncomfortable and sad even more so, but i'd jump between being in awe/bliss and feeling increasingly depressed for others not able to understand all this and by others because I was dysfunctional, family and friends thought i had lost it completely which made me sad and there was nothing I could do about it, for four days I accepted everything that happened in my own way, couldn't possibly be able to be bothered with focusing on regular stuff anymore. After four days things got bad because I wasn't taking care of myself in most ways one should, and the state of mind became more of a curse as I became paranoid about the real state of the world, I would desperately cry, bawling my eyes out about the rights animals have and dont recieve, becoming paranoid about ideologies of hatred that are present everywhere in life, and going through this was overstimulating the neurological synapses and erroded my mental capabilities. I was devestated when my mom took me to the hospital and the hospital security forced a sedative injection on me. I stayed in hospital for six months on risperidone and sequel, no one listened to me about my amazing experiences with divine entities and spiritual awakening all that much, I still wasn't able to pull all the pieces together to back then to articulate it all as I can now, it took a few years and switching meds to make me basically put it all behind me. The doctors saved me from being out of control with no capability to sustain a normal healthy or very long life, but I also believe that if I were to go off my antipsychotic injections indefinitely that I would be able to handle my emotions surrounding all this divine energy and cosmic connectedness."
schizophrenia,eys2vs0,t3_cycapj,1567385502.0,"Sometimes I have delusions in psychosis about Muslim extremists destroying our society and nuking the west and whoever else they hate, same with drug cartels and other totalitarian regimes in the world. In psychosis I become terrified of these types of people are getting closer day by day to taking majority of control over our societies and running amok witg drug and human trafficking torturing and killing anyone that opposes them.

When I was younger, just as islamophobia was fresh on everyones mind, I had my first acute psychosis. Also around that time  I was exposed to footage on the internet of Muslim people doing beheadings, lighting people on fire, people being led running with blindfolds on and  getting shot in the head into a body of water one by one, and that all really affected me. I believe still that there's good in religions of the world wherever a congregation can agree that the extreme shit stated in their religious books should be interpreted with care by  skilled theologists who can understand and interpret what the cultures were going through when their books were first taken seriously. I believe there's a God that loves everything about all his creations, I believe he is struck with incomprehensible woe when we take what God says and use it to hurt each other in any way shape or form. That all said, I moreover blame what i've been exposed to by the media about the middle east for delusions like this. Extremists are scary"

It's so weird how they've cheated us on that notion. They don't govern, they insist on hoarding everyone's wealth and build off the backs of the many other people that are powerless against their overarching regimes. Every circumstance we face as human beings they figure is another method to acquire every last moursel of what little we have in comparison to these political people. All our the fruits of our work, and our freedoms, all accumulated for themselves to enjoy, just taking it from us.  Funds that we have given them over the years the majority of to be left untouched for generations because they hoard vast amounts of it that couldn't possibly be spent in even 1000 years, they won't circulate it, they won't even let us catch a faint glimpse of a thought on how that wealth could be used, they simply have it all, and that's all they care about while the world burns around them, they don't care about the future, they don't care about the universe they live in. Awfully, woefully shortsighted.

We could be putting energy back into our power grids, exploring space, educating people the world over about literally anything and everything, advancing all kinds of technologies, we could all aspire to be a sentient species with pride in ourselves and accomplishments, but these dicks in government wanna guard their fucking shekels and play chess with peoples lives instead. Disgraceful!"

Sometimes getting stoned got so bad I would panic from paranoia  then black out, come to a few minutes later potentially getting into dangerous situations, like attacking strangers on the street without me being aware of how the hell i ended up in the situation.

 Mental health professionals aren't conspiring to control your life, they will however have security subdue you give you a benzo or maybe tranquilizer you if you're being a danger to yourself or anyone else around you, and  confine you to a high observation room until you're calm and can be be assessed and given treatment to become well again.  Most people who accept the help early will manage significant improvement from an acute psychotic breakdown, but the ones who stick to their delusions and oppose being treated and feel their doctors are oppressing them don't turn out as great as they'd figure. By missing doses of their medication as frequently as possible and denying mental health services, they just subject themselves to preventable mental anguish, its fucking stupid.

Also imagine how your loved ones and caregivers must feel about you suffering needlessly. Its got to be hard on them when you don't accept perfectly fine treatment because you're hung up on conspiracy theories"
