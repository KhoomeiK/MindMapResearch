TheAmityAffliction,fiuijjr,t3_f9we0i,1582742062.0,"Yeah the lyrics. I feel that their first ep has more lyrical content than ELYOYLT. It's much worse than pre 2016 era. I loved lyrics back then. Now it's kind of ""burn alive oh yee ye burn alive it's true yea yee ye ye yeeaaah"" or ""all i do is sink all i do is sink ooooo all i do is sink""
To the guy who answered the post above me. Joel has had kids back in 2011, wife and depression. I'm not judging his life but in this spectrum nothing has changed as far as i know. ELYOYLT lyrics just feel shallow compared to Youngbloods ect. It's like 4 verses stretched into 3 minute song. 
Personally i think he could do better but i guess we'll never know why it's that way. Maybe he is happy with the way it is now? If he is happy then I'm happy with this album.

Overall good album 7/10, did not expect this sound."

A wallet just laying on the pillow that was on the floor. Nothing stolen, in perfect condition with all the things.
