EatingDisorders,fo99xzm,t3_g5ym0c,1587614016.0,"Were you significantly underweight or restricting? When I was recovering from AN, I developed severe bulimia and even after I thought I had gained all the weight I needed to be weight restored, I would still binge epically at night, on sweet things usually that I don’t even like or crave normally. O would purge until early morning, cry, regret it, hate myself, tell myself I would stop, and then do it all again tomorrow.) I tried a million techniques. However, Once I got to my pre-ED weight, I stopped. The need to binge at night went away significantly. By also telling people around me about my struggle and trying to eat three meals a day (regardless how big) I’ve managed to not night binge for months, which I always thought was impossible. If you’ve heard of set-point theory or All In, those theories can help explain or provide comfort about this topic. Stephanie Buttermore is a great person for explaining her earlier YouTube videos on All In explain extreme hunger and her process shows getting back in touch with hunger cues and your body. Amanda Sevilla also was talking about it in her last two YouTube videos.
No idea if this helps you or sounds related to what you’re going through, but watching these women talk about food intake and the damage of restricting helped me view my relationship with food and my body better anyway. Stay safe, sending virtual support to you!

EatingDisorders,fm12vg1,t3_fs8n9q,1585670983.0,"I’m really struggling with how much food we have in the house because we’re shopping less frequently (not hoarding tho) and usually I buy food every couple days to avoid the situation, or mitigate potential damage should I start bingeing. It’s making me insane and actually putting me off food altogether. I’m scared at how wack my schedule is and how little/ bad I’m eating (like I had three bowls of Cheerios today and some green juice???) I guess it’s related. 
I’m really trying to have a list for about five days worth of food when I go to the store, and plan my meals (even though this makes me feel trapped, it’s better than the alternative) and then just go in and out as quick as possible without really looking at anyone else’s cart. 
I also try call someone at meal time so I’m distracted and they can check I’m eating and remind me if it’s not enough or whatever. Don’t know if this helps you (I find just reading about people with similar stories is enough sometimes, even if the advice doesn’t suit me)
Stay safe x"
