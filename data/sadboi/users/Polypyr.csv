Option, show some interest in wanting to learn about mental disorders with him, go slow and look for in depth information on things such as splitting. 
Other option, practice some mindfulness, tell him you'd like to talk to him, unfortunately this may put him on edge and likely a little emotionally charged, when you tell him he'll be slightly more receptive because it turns his anxiety into relief because as we all know ""oh this talk isn't about me"" is personally de-escalating, tell him and give him the opportunity to work with you to address it....."

We're all just looking to be loved and the fact you didn't understand your actions at the time doesn't make them excusable, but it doesn't mean there is anyone to blame either. I'm sorry you feel like you do but someone** I assure thinks about you, just don't try to find it in yourself to be more open to others, just let it happen."

You find your own way! just remember not to impose on others! or your going to hurt yourself like every time you impose on your FP and they are either accepting of your loss of faith in yourself or see it as you attacking them but they never see that it's normally a little of both at once, we don't mean to, we just feel emotional strain)  or moral compass in this context"
infp,ezg0cia,t1_ezg0662,1567888418.0,Well I figured not in and of itself of course not. I just was implying the aspect that viewing it and rejecting it seems to come more intrinsically to some then others.
