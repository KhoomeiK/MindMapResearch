I don't have a GP, so I'll do some searching for mental health clinics. 

As for my parents, I'll definitely try. They were always one to be a bit dismissive. Calling off my breakdowns as being desperate for attention, and that because I'm not constantly freaking out I don't have a problem. Which is wrong, it is very constant and prevalent in my life it just doesn't always manifest as breaking down. It's panic & indecisiveness when making decisions, it's always worrying people don't like me, it's a lack of motivation in a lot of what I do, it's complete self hatred whenever I make a mistake and it's then when I breakdown. It's self hatred and constantly seeking validation not to make myself feel better, but to actively try and make the real world match up with how I perceive myself, with everyone hating me. But I don't want people to hate me, its weird it's conflicting and it tears me apart when I start to spiral off into my own thoughts.

I'm going to make sure they understand I need help without getting too nitty in the details since I don't like talking about it to them. It'll be hard, but necessary."
AskReddit,famdntr,t3_e9r8kb,1576201356.0,"Alright so I'm not exactly very... experienced. I'm pretty shy, I'm only 19, and don't think about sex almost ever. I usually not realize the few times I've been flirted, either because it was the last thing on my mind and didn't want to, or it literally flew over my head. 

However, I did hook up once, and for me at least it was pretty out there. We met because she was visiting from Boston (I go to college in NYC). Me, her, and a pretty big group of our friends were hanging out in the school lounge watching movies. We chatted all night, and I even flirted a bit myself which I didn't really do before. I kinda thought it was gonna stop there after the movies. But she wanted to stay longer and make out after our friends left. 

We couldn't go back to my dorm room and she didn't have a dorm so we just stayed there and made out which was already kinda out there for me making out in public. Now to note, it was late so we were confident that no one would walk in cuz no one went there after 2, but keep in mind literally the front and back of the lounge is all windows so I was nervous at first, eventually though I was just enjoying the konent. But then she unbuttoned her pants, caught me completely off guard, but one thing lead to another and it was a whole night of making out, fingering, and a surprising amount of chatting. One of our friends even walked into the lounge, luckily the couch we were on blocked his view (we did keep our clothes on, we werent stupid). We cracked jokes, flirted, touched each other.. a lot,  and just had an amazing night.

She gave me a boatload of confidence in myself, and we're still very good friends afterwards! No hookup will top that night. 

TL DR: First hookup was on a couch in the middle of a school's lounge late at night. The couch blocked the view from the only enterance but it was essentially in public. Had the time of my goddamn life tho."

college,f9vvcof,t1_f9vv9yc,1575680756.0,"I'm taking a leave of absence but I'm extremely scared. I still need to actually get into another school to transfer. 

There is, a lot of shit I need to get over mentally, over my semester leave of absence and the summer before i go back to school. My self confidence is non existent, I'm constantly anxious when thinking or talking about school, and I need to deal with self deprecation and self harm tendencies I've had since I was a kid. It's taken me way too long to realize that what I am is not normal for anyone. I wanted to think I force myself to be ""normal,"" go to school, bite the bullet, get good grades, be social. 

The only thing I've gotten out of it is more harm to myself, constant stream of breakdowns, and I make everyone around me feel awful because of it. And I don't want to do the self-diagnosis stuff, but I really do think I have some form depression or anxiety that needs to be dealt with by the aid of a therapist (I went to the system they have at my school but all they did was put me in an echo chamber with no help, and when I did have a session with a psychiatrist near the end of the spring semester he just prescribed me antidepressants on the first session and stated ""I don't want you being depressed anymore"", and even then he never spoke to me again over the summer).

But taking this leave is scarier just because I don't know what I'm gonna do during and after it. It really does feel my world is at an end but I'm only 19 it shouldn't be. these bad grades are gonna plague me for the rest of my academic career, all because I pushed myself into a field I didn't like anymore, and because I didn't acknowledge I needed a break. 

And I've ruined my life because of it"

college,f8nklk0,t3_e15cqt,1574646295.0,"There's a few reason I went to the school I first went to. Now that I've learned a few things I'm going to leave it but here's why I went:

Cheaper schools got a really bad rep in my high school, prestige meant a lot to a lot of people there and going to one of the cheaper options was deemed ""just a backup"" if anyone didn't get into anywhere else. Where I got accepted to I got a scholarship, it was still hella expensive but I wanted to go to a school with 1) a good reputation & program 2) what I thought was a good community and 3)  I saw private schools as my only option because of my environment.

However I now know that's bullshit. The school I'm currently at and going to transfer out of not only has an awful program for my old major (professors were awful and it was extremely competitive, also I've come to realize I don't want to do this as a profession anymore) it has an awful school environment (everyone is either depressed, loud or on the brink of a mental breakdown) and I feel like in all I was lied to coming here. I've also been dealing with some mental health issues, and this school has not been helping in terms of any kind of support. The environment has broken me down and I've been more depressed and horrible in my life. This school encourages just working your ass off and doing nothing else. Clubs are all just close knit friend groups, events are poorly conducted, and there's no where to just hang out on campus besides the library (which is always filled with graduate students because there's nowhere else got them to go) or outside (and you know after half way through the year no one wants to do that due to the sheer cold). Nothing feels like it was when I visited or even inquired to other current students, I feel betrayed and this school as straight up broken me.

But I'm kinda happy it did, only because I know I want to get, The FUCK, outta here. 

So I'm currently in the process of switching majors, and switching schools to that backup school. I've visited the campus a few times now and rigorously researched their program and environment and it is infinitely better than where I currently am. People are lively but still work, having a wonderful ""Work hard, play hard"" mentality, the school's a lot bigger so there's more people to meet and it's so much more active. Clubs are actually fun and due to the bigger school size they actually feel more inviting which was a pleasant surprise.

Not only am I going to spend a lot less money going here, I'm still going to go to a solid school with good people. I've already made a few friends there and I'm feeling excited to be going there! So yeah. I should've rethought my ideas of what qualifies a good school, prestige and cost means nothing if you're going to feel like shit there and the program is actual garbage."

Now I've gotten closer to death than I have ever before, one time even making full plans to OD after seeing my friends one last time. But I needed alcohol in order to die from the sleeping pills which I wasn't able to steal. 

Now I finally told my parents about some parts of my mental state and my failure as a human being and now my sister and mother finally convinced me and my dad to stop school for a bit, change majors and transfer.

But my grades aren't good enough to reliably transfer into the school everyone sees as a backup (Rutgers). So can't stay at my current school because it'll kill me, I can't not be in school because then I'm worthless and ruined my parents and my own life, and I can't transfer because eim a fucking retard.

Die
Apply to other schools and from there

DODPRDT,f679d6e,t1_f62rbsc,1572717633.0,"Like honestly just throwing this in, and maybe having some ways of shuffling waxadred into your deck (like with shadows, togg’s scheme or other means) just is your late game. a lot of control decks can deal with a full board of 7/5’s for very long. I’m assuming it works the same way shadows do as in you draw a card after you’ve summoned it. If you wanna get real crazy: Anka -> Myra’s Unstable Element -> Waxadred -> Scheme/Shadows. The only thing holding you back at that point would be fatigue, but if you act fast enough that won’t be an issue. 

But if you’re talking about something more stable: Waxadred with Shadows and Candlebreath is already enough, and galakrond/dragon rogue would be able to hold up fine with invoke and lackeys until Waxadred becomes available."

customhearthstone,f46spy6,t3_djoa7u,1571412992.0,"I’m gonna just make my best shot to as how much this card is worth and how much it should be costed (this is also just me rambling about card design so take it with a grain of salt)

Well the best card to compare this spell to is flamestrike, as it’s deal 4 to all enemy minions, which is important to note as it doesn’t affect your board in the way that excavated evil or even holy-nova would. So let’s say the total value of this card is about 5-6 mana (let’s just say 5.5)

Next we need to determine how much mana having a lackey on board is worth. The two cards that care about this are weaponized wasp and heistbarron toggwaggle but let’s use weaponized wasp. Dealing 3 damage is worth about 2 mana, but we gotta take into account that the minion is also understated: so the minion is worth 2.5 mana and the effect is worth 2 mana which makes sense because you need to play another card just to get a lackey in the first place. So 4.5 mana worth of value on a 3 mana card means lackeys are worth about 1.5 mana (which also makes sense because they’re powerful one drops.) 

So having a lackey on board is worth about 1.5 mana, and dealing 3 to all enemy minions is worth about 5.5 mana, the card should be valued at about 4 mana. So your card is a bit under costed for what it’s worth. 

Another thing is that priest usually doesn’t have direct ways of manipulating JUST the enemies board. They have ways of interacting with the entire board at once (whether it be a neutral effect like mass hysteria or an effect like holy nova) So you could just change the text to “deal 3 to all minions” like with excavated evil and have the “downside” be controlling a lackey, or make this cost 4"
