No veo por qué inmediatamente se desprende que hay que aumentar el precio. Eso es lo que no me trago, que el aumento es para bancar el incremento en producción.

Pero igual no estaba hablando de eso.

> I understand your point but it's unfortunately a bit close minded

Yo, I'm acknowledging all other cases and have already said that for those uses, if it works for them, fine. But somehow it is close minded pointing out that if I, as the administrator, decide to weigh in the risks of postponing updates unitl I decide it is a good time for my system envorinment then I should be able to do so. It is my device, my risk. I'm not talking about a corporate network, this is windows 10 for end users, is it not?

> Would you rather Windows suddenly disables any form of download or internet connection features as a measure to prevent people from being at risk?

The dichotomy is fallacious. I'd rather the OS warn and let me choose, before shutting down services. That's the whole point of what I've been saying. The analogy you propose is better suited for, say, a change in the TCP/IP protocols or an upgrade in encryption certificates. In those cases, yes, lose the service until the pc is able to bring the connections up to spec again. But don't download shit or force a shutdown until I say I am done.

It's an awesome tale that includes topics on language, polyamory, death, war, and adventure all mixed in.
