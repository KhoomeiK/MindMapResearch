bipolar,fr18e88,t3_gm34fd,1589815185.0,"I tried mood tracking and it was able to pinpoint my diagnosis! I tried journaling, its super simple. Just get yourself a small little pocket journal. ( Try to get something brightly colored, its harder to lose. ) What I do, is whenever I remember to, I make a small entry, it looks sorta like this:

Month/Day/Time

\*here I write any notes for future me, like what I did that day, or anything that might influence my moods: food, level of sleep, etc.\*

D: (Stands for depression, I rate it on a scale of 1-10. 1 might be feeling kinda weird, 10 is suicidal. feel free to use other numbers or another way to rate it.)

A: (Anxiety. This kinda catches hypomania when I don't recognize it. I rate it the same way.)

H: (hypomania/mania. Again, I rate it the same way.)

Feel free to add other emotions you want to track. I put stupidly optimistic stickers on the back of my journal. It's actually quite beneficial for tracking how you think you'll feel at a certain time, once you start noticing patterns that is. I affectionately dubbed my journal ""My Crazy Journal"". You should look into this, or some other form of mood tracking, its fun and beneficial."
