If you feel like it, do not hesitate to seek medical help. Try to get good quality sleep (I know it can be hard).

But if you just want to talk, drop me a line.

Thinking of you."

Also, I was absent for a couple of weeks after my brother committed suicide in 2012 (it was during my M.A. thesis) and I got a massive support from my lecturers (one of them hugged me when I returned to uni). Also, I was allowed to have two additional years to finish off my studies."
