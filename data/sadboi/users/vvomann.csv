antidepressants,fq1ig3e,t3_ggh212,1589045937.0,"I took lexapro (10mg) for 3 months and felt a huge difference. I felt like I could finally do life again and I wasn’t stuck inside my head anymore. I decided to wean off them bc of the sexual side effects and I gained a few pounds. I also did not want to be on them long term. 

Even though I weaned off by cutting my dose lore and lower the withdrawal symptoms were very real and very intense. Nausea, lightheadedness, irritability, etc.. I don’t feel as happy anymore, the anxiety is back, and I’m in my head a lot. But I won’t lie, it is familiar. 

This was also during a period I was laid off (I don’t mind the break from work though, I wanted to quit anyways) and without distractions a lot of personal pain and trauma from my upbringing are coming up and I am choosing to work through all these thoughts, acknowledge , give them attention, and make peace. I’m ultimately on a journey of self-love and acceptance. 

This is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do but I have to trust that I’m going to get through and and be stronger for it. It’s hard to explain my pain to others, even to my partner, but this pain is mine and I choose to love my entire story."

AskReddit,fnny3rf,t3_g2vph8,1587105392.0,"I reach like a weird looped thinking. I want to kill myself because nothing matters and it’s just so painful to be alive. But if nothing matters than this pain isn’t as real and I need to just stay put. Stay still. Go to sleep. Do whatever to get through those really really bad moments. I try and thinking about looking back at my life when I’m 90 and thinking of those really dark moments and I try and shift my perspective to realize that maybe the pain I’m feeling is more my mental illness rather than the reality and that things like failed classes, messy spaces, a job I don’t enjoy don’t define me. My failures don’t define me and I can’t still write my history, it’s not over yet.

I guess it has gotten me through, I’m still here, but I know in the moment it’s so hard and there is no light. There’s nothing."

I don’t know them or talk to them, so I don’t feel too comfortable going there and asking (especially with the physical distancing happening right now).

Do you think it would be good to plant it in a giant planter? So that the roots never get outta hand it it’s easier to control?"
gardening,fmv7869,t1_fmv4ms7,1586407943.0,It’s not potted. The roots/dirt were wrapped in a tarp. I’m thinking about putting it in a giant pot in my backyard maybe but I’m not sure how doable that is.

I didn’t notice any changes the first couple weeks besides being extremely tired but that went away.

I’m sorry if you don’t have your parents. That must be really hard. Sometimes I think about when I’ll lose mine, and I become accepting of it more when I realize how much of them I carry in me. My personality, my mannerisms, the small things. But also the big things, my passions in music and cinema and art especially—trying to live ethically and compassionately. My siblings and I will carry their memory on that way no matter what. 

I wish nothing but the best for you <3"
bipolar,ff9k80d,t1_ff8ht5b,1579714759.0,"Honestly I can relate to not wanting to share anything. I’m always writing up comments or posts then thinking “what’s even the point”. 

I think for me the anti-depression and anti-anxiety meds I’ve been put on are working. It’s been a little over a month now and I’m feeling okay with participating in small ways.

I didn’t think anyone would watch this, or comment, or care but I guess I was wrong. The support has been so kind. 

I’m trying to be more open with my experiences and be kinder to my heart and forgive myself for what has happened, what I’ve done, and ultimately who I am. This is it, this is everything I have and I need to be okay with all of it. Cleaning is therapeutic and I was feeling good that day and I wanted to document it for myself.

AmItheAsshole,feemr4n,t3_eoq0fz,1579036903.0,NTA. My family has lived in front of a school/park for 28 years and we have heard kids playing/screaming outside everyday of living here. It’s hardly a bother. If I do hear some “screams” I will peak my head out to check on the kids to make sure they are okay but I have never once thought that children in a park should be quiet. That’s ridiculous. They need to get their energy out and it’s better that it’s outside than indoors. If they don’t like the location of the park they need to take that up with the city and get evidence that it’s causing a disturbance.
