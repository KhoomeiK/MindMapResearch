They are also the poorest who often face the harshest voter suppression, who have the quietest voices only because to have a loud voice in the country requires a lot of money. 

We watched corruption happen real time in these primaries too. You can bet any of our electric voting machines were rigged. 

We watched as the numbers rolled in and Benries and Biden's were suddenly flipped. Or watch Biden suddenly get an unexplainable # of votes. People reported their votes getting flipped.

I'm most of the exit polls, Bernie came out on top.

Bernie had the youth excited and voting, thousands of people at his rallies. Free online fireside chats.

 Biden had people saying, ""at least you're not Trump,"" and could hardly fill a room, with $2k fireside chats.
