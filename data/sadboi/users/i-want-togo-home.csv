selfharm,f8tyuyj,t3_e25nbg,1574814722.0,"It is totally normal to not trust your therapist at first. I struggle with it too. I would recommend that you tell him eventually but when you're ready because if you try to tell him and you aren't ready (speaking from what happens when I try and talk about something im not ready for because I think I am) it could send you into a panic attack and be unhelpful. 

I, of course, don't know your medical history or if you have anxiety or trauma or anything, this is just what I have experienced."
