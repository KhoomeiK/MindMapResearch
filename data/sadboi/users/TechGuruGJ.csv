Grand Junction has been, and likely always will be, the town that drags its feet as the rest of the state moves forward. It's made a little progress in the last decade, but in large part, the people here are happy with things being the same. They don't like change and they don't like paying for services no matter how much it would improve your life. It's why our public transit is unreliable, many of our schools look like they haven't been touched since the late 80's, and our infrastructure is falling apart. GJ is a wonderful town on the verge of greatness, but the people will never be willing to let it move forward. To some, that's the best thing about it, but it's an important thing to consider."
