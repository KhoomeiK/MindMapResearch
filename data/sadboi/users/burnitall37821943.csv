SuicideWatch,foejh1t,t1_foeis0g,1587705386.0,"That's because sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. It depends on too many factors like where you get admitted and the quality of care you can afford over the long term. Research your local mental health facilities. Be aware that they probably won't let you self admit unless they think you're a danger to yourself or others, so a cheap way to ensure that is to call the suicide hotline and be obstinate with the agent. However, doing that will mean little control over where you get sent."
SuicideWatch,foej2yi,t1_foeijgv,1587705087.0,"What I said above, but with more purple prose: they reached out to some other force and got help without rejecting it or the help somehow being worse than their original state. They found Christ or were surprised by supportive family members, or got committed after a failed attempt and were either scared into compliance or got lucky and found an assessing shrink worth a damn. Somebody talked to them and said ""That sounds really hard"" and sounded convincing. They had the funds to get medicine and stay on it long enough to work.

There's no guide, just common threads and luck of the draw."
SuicideWatch,foeig2m,t1_foei6wy,1587704611.0,"Who's joking? If you read this board more than once you should know that the success stories very rarely relate to the people who are still suffering. The success stories all wind up offering the same platitudes poster after poster describe as more alienating than comforting. They might offer spiritual solutions to atheists or talk about the support of family to people being abused. And they violate sub guidelines about offering their own experiences as solutions by their nature.

You want to be uplifted, find an old copy of Chicken Soup for the Soul. We're here to wallow."

SuicideWatch,fk6n4uj,t3_fgqqdy,1583907723.0,If you kill yourself you deprive your sibling of their just revenge when they are older. Clearly your sense of morality will not allow that. Why'd you do it all in the first place?
