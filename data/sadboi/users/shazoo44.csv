FLMedicalTrees,fh3t953,t1_fh3gujs,1581272043.0,Yes but there is already fantastic quality aside from one plant and its affordable. One Plant is just Super high quality. But you can still get great bud for a good price.
FLMedicalTrees,fh3t2oh,t1_fh3hzm4,1581271974.0,"The other stuff is not subpar its just not top shelf and it works perfectly fine.

FLMedicalTrees,fh34xdj,t1_fh34in9,1581264838.0,Once flower is more plentiful prices will most definitely drop but the time and effort put into growing not just weed but a specific strain is a work of art that has to me mastered of years of experience.

These dispensaries still have to run as functioning businesses in this new industry. Give it 2 years and product in florida will be high quality and affordable. As for right now, you guys just have to deal with the fact that this is a hybrid medical/retail industry and High quality products will cost more. Everyone is so impatient with the Florida Medical Industry and you guys have forgotten how far we have come!"

Obviously it will have a higher price point but they also have $48 1/8s. If you cant afford that specific product that's your problem and there are plenty of other options for people on the market who want a more affordable option. One priority, quality."
