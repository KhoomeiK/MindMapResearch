bipolar,fe9s82t,t3_enyftw,1578940986.0,"My grandmother who also suffers from mental illness told me this, and it completely changed my mindset. It’s helped me a lot, so if it’s okay I’d like to share it with you and everyone else. 

“You may have bipolar, but the bipolar does NOT have you.”  

Don’t let it control you and your life. Trust me, I know it’s a lot easier said than done. But if you can just push yourself to do something, even as simple as going to class, be proud of it. Doing a load of laundry. Reading your favorite book. Going outside for just a few minutes. Literally any small thing. You have defeated it a little just from that. Every small accomplishment is a win over our bipolar. And when you do, be PROUD! Hope this helps :)"

antiMLM,fdmfx2c,t3_em1rxm,1578548565.0,"As a person struggling with bipolar, this is absolutely DISGUSTING. I cannot physically or mentally function without my medication. If someone told me this, steam would come out of my ears. Mental health is not to be taken lightly, and to brush it off by saying something as simple as fish oil can cure it is absurd."

notliketheothergirls,fdki14c,t1_fdk4odm,1578504268.0,"I used to be obsessed with BVB and other bands alike, (still occasionally listen to them) and I can definitely attest to this. I thought I was so unique and quirky. I thought that everyone else was basic. Then I grew up, and now I’m what these girls would call “basic.” The thing is, I’m actually happier with myself now. I was miserable and hated myself back when I had the NLTOG mindset."
bipolar,fdjs13z,t3_elnav8,1578485379.0,"Pets are the best. They truly are so supportive and comforting. Kinda blows my mind how intelligent they are. They always know when we need comfort.

I had the sweetest cat for the majority of my life when I was misdiagnosed and really going through it. He helped me through so much. I now have a sweet puppy who I’ve had for almost 3 years now, and she’s been here for me through my diagnosis and medication adjustments. 

Your sweet baby is beautiful!! :)"

insanepeoplefacebook,faiespo,t3_e9b185,1576106135.0,"$2 and $4 tips are totally fine.. I serve at a cheap sports bar that sells wings and burgers. We also have daily specials, and $2-$4 a lot of the time are 20% tips here. I still make way more money serving than I did at any other normal wage job so the smaller tips like this still add up so no complaints here🤷🏼‍♀️"
