AskReddit,fg5zc6t,t3_ewtwe9,1580545634.0,"Hmm I have two. 

By the time I was a junior in college I knew I had a problem with anxiety. College is stressful for everybody for many reasons, but I knew what I was feeling was not within the realm of “reasonable”. It came time for my first finance exam, and as I was studying for a degree in finance, in addition to exams being 90% of our final grade, I was naturally very anxious. At least I thought that it was a “natural” amount of anxiety. About halfway through the test I ended up fainting. Head laying on my desk for about 5 mins straight. I learned after that this is what happens to me when I have panic attacks. I started taking lexapro 2 weeks after. 

Also when I was a junior in college (it was a tough year lol), I was frequently staying awake for days on end. No sleep whatsoever, not even time spent resting or laying in bed. I was busy at all hours of the day - cleaning, studying, organizing, shopping, etc. - I would constantly be occupied with some task that didn’t actually need to be done to the point where I wouldn’t sleep for days. I was frequently hallucinating. I experienced these periods a handful of times before I thought perhaps this is not normal lol. My psychiatrist at the time brushed my concerns off and just increased my lexapro to the maximum dose. My episodes grew more frequent and more severe. I graduated shortly after and had to find a new psychiatrist back home. I had about two appointments with him before I had to find another new doctor, as my dad had changed our medical insurance. He also didn’t think it was an issue that I couldn’t sleep for 3 days at a time, multiple times a month. I started seeing my current psychiatrist last year and she took the time to fully re-evaluate me. I was diagnosed as bipolar II and started anti-psychotics right away. It’s taken almost a year but my medication is finally sorted out and I’m able to be much more stable. It took nearly 2.5 years for a doctor to listen to me and for me to get the help that i needed. 

Pay attention to the way that you feel, think, and act. If something feels wrong then tell someone. Tell anyone who can possibly help you until someone listens to you. Trust yourself when you think that your mental state has gone beyond what you think is normal."

BipolarReddit,f0q9ff8,t3_d64zck,1568856106.0,"When I’m (hypo)manic I struggle with this too. One part of it is that my brain is so scattered and my thoughts are moving so fast that I don’t remember to eat. The other part is that I just don’t get hungry. I’ll go multiple days without eating until I realize that I haven’t ate. 

So yes. I feel your pain. It’s so bad for your body to not eat though. What helps me is setting alarms to remind myself to eat during the day. For me, fresh foods like fruit is what’s easiest to take down when I have no appetite. Find something, anything, that you can get yourself to eat a few times a day. Even if it’s not a lot. You start to feel a lot better. You got this."
BipolarReddit,f0p70gz,t3_d5thby,1568828550.0,"I’ve had generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and depression on and off since I was 14. At 19, I started taking Lexapro. When my dose was increased it triggered my first manic episode, but I didn’t know what it was. Even after decreasing my meds I was still cycling through mania and depression. 

I was staying up for 48+ hours at a time. I was studying for 12 hours straight. I was going to the store and spending hundreds of dollars on things that I didn’t need. I was visibly extremely high-energy, when my demeanor is normally very relaxed. I was going to parties when that’s not typically my scene. I was hanging out with people that I barely knew when I’m normally too anxious for that. After cycling a few times and presenting these symptoms time and time again, I knew something was wrong. 

I saw a new psychiatrist and was fully re-evaluated. That’s when I was diagnosed and started anti-psychotics. They’ve truly saved my life and provided me with a much more stable mental state. 

If you’re concerned about your mental health, and if you have the means to, you NEED to seek professional help. That’s the only way you can know what is truly going on with you and it can provide you with peace-of-mind. They can and will help you."

I was anxious in class because I couldn’t focus on the lesson, and that inability to focus made me even more anxious. Since I was little I’ve never been able to pay attention in class and always had to teach myself outside of class, but it started bothering me more and more.

BipolarReddit,ey5yc9b,t3_cvhqxk,1566843171.0,"Me!!!! I had been on 10 mg Lexapro to treat anxiety and depression for about 9 months with no problems. My depression worsened and I was bumped up to 20 mg. That is when I absolutely lost my mind and experienced mania for the first time, but I didn’t know what it was. I just felt like I was going insane. I went back down to 10 mg, but I was never the same. Still felt like I was just losing my mind. My doctor brushed it off and didn’t think this feeling was a big deal, barely even asked questions about it. 

This April my new psychiatrist decided to re-evaluate me herself instead of relying solely on the diagnosis of depression from my old doctor. She diagnosed me with bipolar 2 and put me on Abilify. 

I am eternally grateful that my new doctor took the time and cared enough to do that evaluation. I haven’t felt this stable and normal in a really long time. 

If you feel like your psychiatrist isn’t fully invested in your care and treatment, please try to get another opinion or multiple opinions, if you have the means. It truly saved my life."

AskReddit,epfbwi4,t3_bue7cv,1559193915.0,"More of a district-wide scandal. 

Two new high schools were built in 2007, doubling the size of our district. This was a result of our superintendent and school board showing the taxpayers the “tremendous growth” in population that we were expected to see in upcoming years. They new buildings are “state-of-the-art”... mine even had a dog training facility attached to it!

By 2015 our school district was bankrupt. Bad. The board voted to close down my high school, one of the two new ones, as we couldn’t afford to keep all four open. Our district had the worst financial rating in the state. 

As it turns out, our superintendent at the time the schools were built was basically in cahoots with the construction company. Two new schools meant his salary and pension doubled, while the construction company benefited from the business. The “prospective growth” our area had built the schools for was never actually expected to happen. The numbers were fudged. Tricked everyone, all the taxpayers who voted for them. 

In case that’s not bad enough, the superintendent was also embezzling money from the district. That super fun dog training facility? Built with stolen funds from the district. For his two Australian shepherds. 

He’s been indicted on federal fraud charges and is awaiting trial."
