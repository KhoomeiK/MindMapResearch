The more we face ourselves the easier it gets though. As others have said, grounding exercises help. Sometimes just touching yourself or squeezing your toes into the ground or pressing your hands against a surface help.

It can be odd to look at yourself and be unfamiliar but it makes sense though because of being dissociative...

I understand you can't see a therapist now so here are some techniques/ exercises I tried at that age that helped me and some things I do now:

- Name 5 things you can see and describe them
- Name 3 good things that happened today whether it's petting your cat or drinking your favorite drink
- Write down your thoughts and reflect
- Take hot or cold showers
- Step outside and walk to a sign or tree or whatever in the distance and then walk back
- Reach out to others and talk about anything mundane
- Talk to your other ""selves"" and be empathetic
- Focus on your breathing (basically, meditate)
- Squeeze your whole body real tight into a hug, hold your breath, and release 

I did a lot of self destructive things, especially at your age. It's a tough age and dealing with ptsd is a lot...sometimes we help others so that we avoid our selves.

Find your boundaries, find people who make you feel comfortable and have an understanding.

I asked what kind of spiced rum they had (his favorite too) but the kind he liked was too expensive (I'm cheap). Also, I kept telling him the other bartender was adorable (everything is adorable when I'm drunk). 
The door guy was trying to play cupid though and invited me out the very next night.
So, I came the next night for a show and he was the drunk one and was celebrating his birthday. I didn't think I liked him even when he told me he liked me a week or two later. My bf at the time and I broke up soon after and I had a make out rebound before dating my now SO of about 3 years."

It is irresponsible of him not to have condoms that are safe for him to use. Basically, he just wants to have sex with people without a condom. And to be safe, I would I get tested if he always has not used condoms. The pill only protects from pregnancy (and obviously helps with other things that are not related to sex). So, who's being the irresponsible one to begin with...he is the one who refuses to wear condoms that he's not allergic to.

As someone who also has trauma, I learned boundaries in therapy--its hard for people in your life to keep your best interest because they have their own self interest and are biased, I had to find my own self interest and was helped through therapy. He wants things from her too and she can't be fully helped by him if this is the case and seems to be asking too much of him."

He left me when he felt I wouldn't fit into his life. He was assessing my worthiness the whole time and was slow about it imo (3 months). I was staying over about 4 times a week too.

He tried to hook up later on and I realized what a dick he was.

I'm now with someone who is on the same page as me. Who knew what they wanted from the start--commitment, romance, love, a lifelong partner. We may have developed/processed this love in different ways and speeds (surprisingly him faster) but we both wanted the same kind of relationship."
relationship_advice,f3s2bkd,t1_f3rhqhk,1571095820.0,"He began seeing a therapist and talked openly about his progress to me. He talked about his past and how that abuse seeped into his present. He explained to me anything and everything. After 6 months, he got annoyed with me sometimes when I kept asking and kept being self conscious but owned it too; he knew he contributed to my doubts.

He reassured me. He let me know how beautiful he finds me. But, most importantly HE PUT THE WORK IN. He didn't just say things but actively did things and worked on himself. 

He let himself be vulnerable with me and cried in my arms. He exposed himself almost or maybe as much as I felt he stripped me raw. 

I still have self conscious days but what he said to me is at the bottom of the pile now instead of the top because that self consciousness was there long before him...but it's still on him that he broke my trust and confidence.

How did I overcome it? Therapy and a partner who, again, put the work in. He's the one and he proved it by gaining my trust back and putting his ego in check and his vulnerable side more accessible. He stopped caring what others thought and took a page of my book and cared only what those close to him think--more importantly, took a long look at what he actually thinks and feels.

I'm not sure if there was one moment after it happened that made me feel it was worth staying that stands out other than those feelings I felt at the start were still there even if they were muffled by all the noise he caused. Now, those good feelings are stronger than ever.

It's going to suck for awhile though and it's hard work for both of you. You're asking to put her through that. My partner was also selfish in wanting to stay with me. But I wanted to stay with him. Just know she may think of leaving you often and probably thinks you won't care because she feels not good enough. If you stay together you're looking at a long time of those thoughts. You've already put her through a lot. Focus on working on yourself because that's all you can do--and the only thing that will get through to her."

It took me 2 years to get over things fully...I almost wanted to break up at first. But he was persistent and as reassuring as he could be.

I asked similar questions of him as well minus the threesome.

Do you want threesomes still? Do you care if you never have them again? Do you enjoy sex with her more?

Reassure her as bluntly as possible. 

Sex with your ex may have been more ""just sex."" I'm assuming sex now is more meaningful...you get more out of it. Tell her. She may not believe you at first but when you do respond say exactly what you mean and don't allude because anxious people will try to find what isn't being said. And, no, that part isn't on you, but it helps when the person you care about is hurting.


As for your friend. I don't know the circumstance but I see most romantic or plationic relationships as fairly equal in feeling. If you have sexual or romantic feelings for this friend or her for you,  it's not equal if the other does not...meaning that's not friendship. You've been sexual in the past and maybe you don't think about them that way anymore, but if they do for you that's not equal. When people say they can ignore that there is still some sexual/romantic lens from which they view and do things, that cannot be ignored. I would think on that.

Also, at the time I had been seeing a therapist and continue to see one; it definitely is not all on you to help with her self esteem other than the damage you caused  [edit]."
demisexuality,ewlm3q2,t1_ewlj8w1,1565529437.0,"I find it always is wrapped up with the person you're with and how strong the connection is at any one time. For reference, I'm 29f and my partner is 28m of 2 years, sometimes when I'm distracted sex does feel empty and I'm not as present. Other times I focus on how much I love this person and the sensations of my body and his and how it feels physically. 

The sexual attraction for me is the anticipation as well. Seeing him undress and knowing the the feelings about to happen and how even closer we will be. The sexual attraction isn't really about checking him out, but the way he makes me feel when he smiles and wants me. Yes, I find him attractive. But the sexual nature of it is how our connection leads to me wanting more...letting myself go into the ""primal"" nature of it to connect in other ways."

relationshipgoals,ew0boei,t1_evv09ye,1564982336.0,"I guess it depends on the type of anxiety. For me it helps when my partner gives reassurance with words and actions. I personally like to hear the words of reassurance because I end up repeating the negative ones over and over in my mind, so to hear something positive helps counteract it. This is not to say that I don't work on my anxiety on my own though. It's taken some time for my partner to realize that I am getting better and for him to not to jump each time I get anxious over something. So, another advice would to not always assume each anxious moment will blow up. That making those assumptions sometimes can help push it to blow up because the other person doesn't feel understood or listened to or may not feel comfortable sharing.

Talk to each other about what triggers anxiety. If it's something general or something anchored in the past, there are still triggers. A lot of the work on the person with anxiety is for them to become more aware of their own anxiety and what causes it. For the person in a relationship with them it is to be aware of how you react to it and how you can be there for them if they want but to also make sure you're not overwhelmed too.

I've started to let him know ahead of time of social events that I may check in with him occasionally and what that may look like. When at the event I let him know when I am feeling anxious and that I would like to be by his side in that moment. Usually he is playing a show and can be busy when we are out at those kinds of events, but lately he has taken it less as me being clingy (former assumption) to me seeing him as a safe place to rest from the crowd. I also know I can step outside as well when overwhelmed.

I hope that helps?"
