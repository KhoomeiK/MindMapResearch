depression,fp72wpw,t1_fp70ncy,1588363062.0,"Ok, man. That's your choice. If I were you, though, instead of just rushing headfirst into chemo, I'd at least try this method for a month and get an assessment from the doctor to see if it's working... You don't have much to lose at this point. Fruits, berries, and melons for a month won't kill you. You can go to chemo if this method doesn't work, but I'm quite confident it will. At least watch one video by Robert Morse before dismissing this. Please.

depression,fp70p9a,t1_foxjaa5,1588361931.0,"That's actually a profound way of looking at it... The ancient people thought of the body as a type of prison too. It's the spirit's carbon prison with 5 windows (senses). Don't obsess too much on the material, man. Stay more on the spiritual side. Life is just a journey. Try to enjoy it while you're at it :)"
depression,fp6ziic,t1_fp6aajd,1588361331.0,"Cancer isn't some permanent thing that once you've got, you've got it forever... It's just acidic, toxic cells in the body that the interstitial fluid couldn't flush out through the kidneys. Stop telling him that it's hopeless and he's going to die. It's not hopeless. If he eats alkaline foods, there's a good chance his acidity will drop and get his lymphatic system running properly again."
depression,fp6y2gq,t1_fp5tctm,1588360598.0,"He's not ""some yt guy."" He's a naturopath whose read more volumes of A&P books than an entire hospital full of doctors combined... He knows what he's talking about. People message him every week thanking him for saving their lives. What he preaches is logical and rational. It totally makes sense. At least look into it before criticizing. Chemotherapy is the worst type of treatment for cancer patients. It literally kills you. The only reason it's pushed by the medical industry is because there is so much money in it."
depression,fp5px44,t3_gb8bjf,1588337074.0,"Hey man, look up Dr. Robert Morse on YouTube. People get cancer when acids build up in their body due to a blocked lymphatic system. To negate that acidity, you have to start eating alkaline foods.

I bet you eat a lot of processed foods. Cut that out. Eat FRUITS, BERRIES, AND MELONS. Just eat those 3 food types. Blend them with some water if you want to. Throw some salt on them too because you need electrolytes.

Don't eat meat. Don't eat vegetables. Don't eat pizza. Don't eat snacks. Fruits, berries, and melons for a good month. Throw some 48 hour dry fasts in there too because cancer cells have more insulin receptors than healthy cells, so fasting kills them.

Don't take any chemotherapy or other drugs. Those will just acidify you even more and weaken your immune system. Fruits, berries, and melons. With some salt. That's your medicine. The alkaline should raise your Ph and get your kidneys/lymphatic system working properly again. Watch Robert Morse's videos too.

Don't give up, man. If you really want to live, at least go down trying to heal yourself. Just giving up and waiting to die is what losers do. You're not a loser. Losers quit. Winners don't."
depression,foucbzp,t3_g98jxp,1588081265.0,"Imo if you commit suicide, you won't be reincarnated as a human again. Most likely, you'll have to ""work your way up"" from an animal life, or worse, a plant or microorganism life... You are the apex species in this world. Stay alive and learn what you can here... I don't think the gods will forgive your spirit for committing suicide. Try your best here and just live, no matter how bad it gets. Who knows... You might just end up being one of the lucky few that escapes the firmament and gets to the heavens above. :)"
SuicideWatch,focxjae,t3_g6jvbq,1587677188.0,"I don't know if the gods will forgive you for suicide.... They blessed your spirit with a human vessel... You're the apex species on this earth. And you will throw it away because of a little depression? Yeah, good luck escaping that firmament above and getting into the heavens... That won't happen. You will just end up reincarnated as an animal, or worse, a cockroach...
Use this incarnation to progress spiritually. Life isn't about money, drugs, work, etc... It's about elevating your frequency so when you die, you leave this earth for good. Everything on earth exists on the principles of electromagnetism. We are electromagnetic beings. Raise your frequency if you want to leave earth for good. Suicide wont get you out of here..."
SuicideWatch,foaoqhf,t3_g61vpg,1587650078.0,"The spirit is eternal. The carbon vessel is temporary. Don't take your life too seriously... We aren't here to impress others with money, jobs, fancy homes, etc... We are here to raise our consciousness and escape this material plane (earth) after death...

Everything on this earth is electromagnetic. We are electromagnetic beings. When you think, you get brain waves. Keep those brain waves at a high frequency... Think positive! That's how you ascend to the heavens after death. If you keep a low frequency via negative thoughts and actions, you'll be reincarnated again on this plane... And it might not be as a human. 

This life is your chance to ascend your spirit to the heavens. Don't take your life seriously, but don't squander it with negative thoughts either. Think positive and just be a good person. Help others. Hurt no one. You'll be alright!"

2) Viruses are just dead proteins that toxic cells eject
3) Those ""tests"" look for immunities by looking for anti-bodies... You don't need vaccines for that...
5) Some ingredients in vaccines: barium, aluminum, ethyl mercury, fetal kidney cells, bovine serum... Need I go on?
4) Germ Theory vs Terrain Theory. Google it
5) ID2020 and Event 201. Google them.

Feel free to get vaccinated. Just don't force the rest of us to as well..."
