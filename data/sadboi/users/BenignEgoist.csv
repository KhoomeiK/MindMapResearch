Cause you know there are people out there seeing this and completely ignoring the reason they’re protesting and instead just dismissing it while thinking “Look at these people spreading the rona” 

I’m personally not diminishing their protest. This situation deserves a voice. And I think it even says more that while there’s a huge risk going on in the world people still won’t let this situation be quietly swept under the rug.

I just don’t see this as being something against the competitive spirit. I think it DOES take some skill to spot Llamas. You’re consciously looking while dropping while other people are just looking at the other players or their target landing spot. You’re so familiar with the map you know that little group of pixels is a Llama instead of a rock or a pink vehicle. And then you get to make the risky decision to get to those Llamas, usually out in the open, not near weapon spawns, or in a tree you need to chop down and give away your position.

It’s not really a matter of YMMV, as Customs **won’t** import products without the duty and taxes being paid. Your shipper, however, may have had a broker. The broker would be responsible for getting your product through customs, including any fees, and then would bill either the shipper or receiver to recoup those fees. Depends on the contract they hold with the shipper. Typically the person importing the product pays for the import fees. In this case the shipper, being a big fancy international name, wants no delay on the shipping, so hires the broker for faster clearance through customs, but still bills the receiver for those import fees."

Their money making machine will quickly dry up if they managed to get the game to be nothing but pub stomping.

I remember the game before arena or SBMM. We were begging for something like Arena because we thought that would be our SBMM. But the whole hype thing didn’t really put you against equally skilled players as a Bush camper can easily make it to contender and while that takes good rotations and positioning, it doesn’t take much mechanical skill. Then they came out with straight SBMM in pubs and I felt like that pitted me against my skill better than arena did. So minus the siphon, why would people go arena? 

I got a survey from Epic over the weekend and some of the questions they asked were like “What do you think of SBMM based on building/shooting?” And honestly I love this line of thinking they’re surely exploring. Something like how many mats you place in a period of time, accuracy, etc, feels like a much better way to match people than just lifetime stats or whatever they’re currently using. 

People are going to play the game to have fun. That means sweats doing sweaty things. Epic has to figure out a way to incentivize the sweats to go sweat together and let the casuals have their brand of fun. But how the game is at this moment, that’s just not the case."

It’s working your brain just like any other muscle. It takes time and dedication. 

Just like going to the gym you might only do a few reps because your muscles are weak from having never gone before, you might only occasionally catch that your brain is doing it’s anxiety thing and just say “hey, I recognize this thought pattern as being anxious” 

But then after a week or two at the gym you do a few more reps. So now you’re used to recognizing when your brain does it’s anxiety thing, you’re catching it more, so now you try addressing the anxiety “my brain is anxious and telling me everything is going to go to shit... but hey I remember this one time it didn’t go to shit. See brain, it’s not always going badly.” 

Now you’ve been going to the gym for awhile and you start doing those reps with more weight. Now you’re recognizing what type of anxiety your brain is displaying, and quickly have a reality based example to give yourself for each type of anxiety thought (all or nothing thoughts “you’re ALWAYS a fuck up! / That’s not true brain, remember when we drew that handmade card for our grandmother and she still displays it?” , self hatred thoughts “EVERYONE hates you! / That’s not true either, brain. I have friends who go out of their way to call me, no one is going to do that for someone they hate.” Etc) 

Ok now you’re getting swole. You feel great! You pick up those original weights and do your original reps with ease! Just like how now you almost don’t even need to consciously try to rebuke those anxious thoughts. You just have an anxious thought and the positive one comes right after on its own. 


Again, different methods work for different people. But CBT and anti-depressants changed my life. It’s still a daily effort just like the guy that’s gone to the gym for the last 10 years and looks in great shape still has to maintain.

We see evidence aim assist is very strong (clips of SMG tracking) then we get beamed in game...must be controller! Even without any proof, only a hunch...it MUST be controller! But now that unconfirmed assumption is apart of the file in our brain as evidence aim assist is too strong...and it further perpetuates past the point of how strong aim assist actually is.

My response is not about just this one father. It’s in general. It’s saying any parent who uses the excuse you originally tried to give is a shit parent. Parents are SUPPOSED to monitor their kids lives and interest. Maybe not know every detail, but be aware and def dive deeper when necessary, like when the kid starts competing in tournaments maybe a parent should like read the rules...

Then you went on to say that this dad was a good dad just because they were present when the kid was streaming. It’s a nearsighted view. I think they’re a shit parent. They’re teaching the kid to find loopholes in the rules (in order to stream on Twitch) or that the rules don’t apply (by letting the kid compete when the rules said he was too young) And it honestly wouldn’t surprise me if the kid is being exploited for what money they can bring into the family."
FortniteCompetitive,fplai45,t1_fpjnl4j,1588709241.0,"Yes for competitions. But arena is not competing. It’s considered a competitive mode, yes I understand that. But it itself is not competing for anything. You don’t win anything by playing Arena on its own. You play arena to qualify for actual competitions. So given that Arena itself does not have an age limit, it is only individual competitions that have the age rule, I don’t see why he should be banned for 4 years from Arena. The 4 year ban on competing in tournaments makes every lick of sense there is. Totally reasonable to ban him until he’s 13 and can then compete anyway. Also makes sense that there be some punishment (as being banned from competing until he’s 13 isn’t really a punishment, more enforcing an established rule) and for that some sort of ban in Arena makes sense to me, like 2 weeks, 2months, something like that. But the 4 years does seem harsh in a game mode that itself does not have an age limit on. 

All of that said, it’s not the end of the world if the kid can’t play arena for 4 years. I hope the parents learn something, too. This is more so their fault than the kids."

Teaching the kid to skirt around Twitch rules, letting him compete in a tournament he’s not old enough for...these parents are teaching him he doesn’t have to pay attention to the rules. This is how we get entitled assholes as adults. And I’m not saying the kid now is any kind of entitled or assholeish.

Or laws pertaining to the information a company can collect on minors and the information Fortnite requires when competing might violate those laws so fine just have people be older.

Of course people are going to barely watch a show they think has drastically gone downhill. 

It’s not even just about the writing. The animation is *too* crisp. It’s bland and boring and stiff. Watch early seasons and enjoy how rubbery not only the Simpsons are but things like the background weren’t perfect flat one point perspectives.

Except the fight for slavery was the biggest defining difference. The south was primarily agricultural because white people didn’t have to go out into the fields in a time when AC didn’t exist to pick their own damn cotton. They had free labor to do that for them. They argued about what the federal government could do because the federal government was telling them to stop owning people as property, and that was going to greatly harm their way of life. 

You’re right it’s hard to separate slavery from any civil war discourse because it’s a HUGE part of it. Most of any of the nuanced aspects you’re talking about still boil down to slavery."
FortniteCompetitive,fp68di2,t1_fp67gkb,1588347915.0,"All of that still boils down to slavery. The south was able to contribute so much financially because they had free labor en mass. They wanted their independence to continue making money hand over fist with that free labor. 

The civil war is very nuanced. Like the north might not have had slaves in the same way the south did, but they did pay minorities less and they lived in company housing that their paycheck barely afforded them so they were just as chained to their jobs in the north as they were in the south. It took years (and is still in some form of evolution today) to start seriously doling out actual equality to minorities in both the north and south. 

But none of that changes the reality that the confederacy wanted to be left alone to continue to own people as property to support their wealth."
