Hypothyroidism,fl5yk83,t3_fmqvy1,1584849143.0,"I'm incredibly doubtful that it's your levothyroxine. It takes anywhere from weeks to months to feel any change while on them. In fact, for me it was like the effects of the hypothyroidism itself got worse before they went away thanks to levothyroxine. I was a zombie for months even after treatment started. I had constant fatigue, staying awake for a handful of hours before I needed rest.

Depression, including the emotional numbness that it can bring, is a side effect of hypothyroidism. I really think your condition is just getting worse before it gets better.

Discuss it with your doctor if you are concerned, but I really dont think the levothyroxine is to blame, and your doctor will probably agree. 

These are scary times, too, so its gonna affect your mental health too. Just take care of yourself and do some self care as best you can. It will get better :)"

It just takes time but once your levels are steady you will feel great and the wait will have been worth it. Whenever you feel worried and anxious just remind yourself that you just gotta wait for the next blood test and theres nothing you can do til you see those results. It can be hard to relinquish control but your body is doing it's best, just be kind patient with it.

You got this :)"
Hypothyroidism,fd1s5sr,t1_fczqj5n,1578135961.0,"When I was diagnosed I looked up about this a LOT. It is common to mistake the hair loss as a side effects of the medication. It is actually a delayed side effect of hypothyroidism itself. And because you know you have hypothyroidism you're noticing it. Once I got my diagnosis it was like the fatigue got worse. 

It is gonna take time. It takes at least 3 months for you to feel better. Which sucks I know. Treatment for hypothyroidism takes a LOT of patience. You wouldn't suddenly go hyper, especially after just 2 months of medication. 

You'll get through, it's just gonna take time. Give it at least another month or two, and if you're still concerned bring it up with your doctor again, and besides, you'll probably be due another blood test in a month or so,  which will tell you if the medication is working."
