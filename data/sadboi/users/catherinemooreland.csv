I think you look great and if your body structure is any similar to mine (which it seems like!), then you certainly aren’t too thin. I used to weigh 120lbs for years when I was a teen and then 125lbs for two years or so. Even though I was ‘skinny’ I wasn’t underweight. If you’re considering losing some more weight, I’d honestly say give it a go and see how you like it. Dropping down to 125lbs might be a bit on the lower side of the spectrum, especially if you’re looking to develop more muscle, but as long as you have a healthy mindset around it (so not getting obsessed with if) then I’d just do what feels right for you/what sparks your curiosity."
Kibbe,fmpyfsy,t1_fmpwf2n,1586289601.0,"I would say your colours are on point!

I personally do not meddle much with the whole season typing since there are too many different opinions out there on what constitutes what, but each person’s ‘colour profile’ is made up of these three gradients: undertone, clear/muted and contrast. If you stick to colours that match those, you’ll create the most harmonious look, but if you truly understand then you can start playing around with them to create certain vibes. 

For example, if you’d like a very soft summery look that blends in well, you could wear a colour that’s slightly less contrasted (like a pastel copper), wear lighter makeup and add some highlights to your hair. 

For a goth look, make sure to contrast your natural undertone with what you’re wearing: if you’re warm (like you) you’d wear a foundation that’s more on the cool side, which creates that pale and almost sallow look. 

If you’d like something a bit more high contrast you could wear a warm/dark brown top with brown eyeliner, and a bold bronze lip, thereby creating harmony in the contrast level between your clothes (dark brown + your pale skin = medium-high contrast) and your makeup (again, darker colours + fair skin = medium-high contrast). 

The only thing I’d recommend anyone avoid is to have different levels of contrast between elements of their look. So let’s say a person has high contrast between hair and skin because they have dark hair and fair skin: they wouldn’t look great wearing a pastel coloured dress for example, because it would blend in with their skin (creating low-contrast) which would look unharmonious with their high hair/skin contrast, making their head an emphasised focal point of attraction. 

Of course, there are situations where one might like to play up their facial features. In that case I would recommend to still keep the contrast levels of clothing/skin and hair/makeup/skin very similar, since repeated tend to emphasise each other. (Think of the way that wearing warm colours on a warm undertone make both pop, rather than wearing opposites!)

Phew, that was a novel to type. Hope it helps you and (maybe) some others! Good luck with your style journey ❤️"

Kibbe,fmo8df3,t3_fwfkip,1586249239.0,"From your hair and eye colour I’d say you have a warm undertone. I think you’re wearing foundation in this picture (but I might be wrong). If so, the colour you’re wearing is too cool for your skin thereby creating a slightly greyish hue. The pink (also cool undertone) of your eyeshadow and lips stands out in comparison to your hair and eye colour, thereby once again implying that you’re a warm undertone. A more bronze colour would probably blend in with all your characteristics a lot more and give you a more ‘natural’ beauty look. Also the white and black look quite harsh on you. In terms of colour, I’d once again say they’re too cool for you - try substituting the white for a cream and the black for a deep brown. In terms of contrast I’d say you’re somewhere in the middle of the spectrum and you seem to have clear coloration (so no grey added). Hope this helps! Also, I’d love to see you post a picture with these changes, cause then I can see whether I was right 🙈"

BipolarSOs,fmmh6p8,t1_fmmgk3e,1586205194.0,"The way I see it is that there’s a difference between judging someone (by which you do not take a stance to understand them) vs talking to them in a constructive way about their destructive behaviour (by acknowledging their situation/illness and approaching them with love and understanding). 

Of course, if boundaries are crossed by the person in question and they treat you badly, that should be talked about, but that is a problem in communication and not specifically caused by their bipolarism. If this is the case, I do recommend you talk it over once they’re at a more stable point emotionally speaking (not saying you should wait for weeks to talk it over) in order to avoid yourself getting into a situation where they might get unreasonably upset with you that otherwise would not occur were they more at peace."
fasting,fmmgj3b,t1_fmm7qh6,1586204857.0,"I just completed my 48hr fast this morning. I was quite shaky as I woke up and felt weak. What I can recommend is to distract yourself (from the cravings) and to keep drinking a lot. Most likely you’re dehydrated which can roar it’s ugly head most when one’s doing a fast. If that doesn’t help you can supplement with sodium (you can read up on how to do it properly) and if you feel like your body is crying for food, it’s all right to feed it. Sometimes it’s a question of perseverance and other times it’s best to give in and try again in a week or so. The headache can be a detoxification symptom of the body as it’s using fat cells for fuel. Certain toxins etc are stored in the fat cells and during the process of breaking these down a byproduct of the dead cells can cause a temporary flare up of uncomfortable bodily symptoms like headaches and rashes. I recently read about it and unfortunately I can’t remember what this reaction is called, but if you do some research you’ll probably find it. 

Hope my message is of any help to you! Of course, I don’t know your specific situation so it might not apply, but I hope you find what works for you and what doesn’t."

I understand you want to be there for him while he figures out his way of coping with the diagnosis, but it’s most important to take your own best interest into account, which aren’t served by a constant and pervasive worry about what he might be doing or seeing on social media and outside of that.

If he says he’s feeling smothered it’s probably because he has so much going on in his mind right now that your affection (however much he appreciates you!) is just too much to deal with energy-wise. Once he’s more stable again, ask him what he wants out of the relationship and how you can best help him when he’s feeling down. Most bipolar people already feel guilty about not being able to give their SOs the attention they want to give, so I’d recommend you make him feel supported and understood whilst also explaining that you’d really like it if he’d be a bit more accommodating to your needs for affection whilst he is down, and making a plan for what to do when he gets low again.
