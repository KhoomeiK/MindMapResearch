mentalhealth,eohfrmf,t1_eofxzv7,1558580410.0,"That's the usual answer, and i already explained elsewhere why it's useless. First cause my passions are just passive suff, like reading, playing videogames and watching movies, and there aren't clubs of sorts where i live, second cause every time i meet with people with similar interest i cannot really relate with them for how different our approach and level of involvement with them are, and even if we happen to have similar tastes, that doesn't change the fact that just having similar interests doesn't imply the formation of any bond, and the person (as everyone i ever met) is completely uninterested in forming any relationship with them and/or i really don't like them.
Also, i've lost countless hours in those kind of ""activities"" (writing groups, acting classes etc.), only to end up more depressed cause of how much i understood i was different than others and how much i failed with every attempt at relating with them.
I wven took a month break from fb the other month, didn't change shit."
