I didn't choose to be single but I am because I never found someone that loves me for who I am or wants me. I do love myself and as cliche as that advice loving yourself sounds, focusing on myself won't guarantee me a a guy your just doing whatever you go to do in order to make in life. As of now I do what's best for me go succeed because my true love is my passion. Humans can't do anything with me or think about me whatsoever I just am around.

Overuse of the internet increases depression because it makes you miss out on real human connection but its good anyways when you have no one to look forward to and to talk about what your thinking or feeling.

They take students like me and expect me to accept what they did by forcing me into an ambulance and taking me to a hospital by my stupid psychologist who called them and to be honest I HATE COPS. They were everywhere, whenever there is a problem that involves suicide they always feel the need to be there, it is so unnecessary and so fucking rude even to me, from my point of view they are not in the position to handle how I feel especially (psychologists counselors etc) what I was planning to do with myself. It's none of their business to try to control my life and say I had suicidal ideations and depression even If i didn't mention it to them. I had done nothing to deserve what they did to me. They are the worst people to ever give me a hard time this year, children and adults will never change by putting them in the hospital and because of suicide and they were wrong for what they did to me.  They also tried to take money from my insurance all based on a lie from my school that told them I was not safe and that I was suicidal and depressed just to turn against my parents putting my parents against me all because they wouldn't attend a meeting at my school.
