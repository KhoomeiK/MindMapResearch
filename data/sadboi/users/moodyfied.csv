[Bilder på hur det kommer se ut. 2016-2020](https://imgur.com/a/DtIDw2I)

Vad jag snabbt kan anmärka i arkitektens vision är att det saknas räcken - En gågata på en spårvagnscentral är inte det smartaste upplägget.

Buskar täcker viktiga vinklar chaufförer vill ha kolla på. 

Hållplats saknas för trafik till och från Södra Vägen??

Om linje 4 svänger i den kurvan från Södravägen till Mölndalsvägen kommer det gnissla i hela Göteborg och belasta den korsning och hållplats som redan idag är en flaskhals.

Restaurants are crowded and bars are closing same late hours. Those who are supposed to temporarily study or work from home are doing so from cafés or restaurants instead, generally most people downtown is going completely against the recommendations. i.e go shopping, hang out in big groups, and fill up busses and trains. I've seen way too many seniors carelessly shopping for secondary needs. 

There are a few very nice ladies from public health office who runs around during daytime with tape measures. However the restaurant owners are just pushing those restrictions after they've gone home. 

But I haven't seen any patrolling officers, actually no presence at all. Doing a quick search; In the beginning of april a drunk man (in another city) was arrested for coughing (suspected assault). that's it.  

Most schools are still open. EVERY retirement home here have the virus circulating.

Gothenburg,fppcax3,t1_fpp6mz1,1588799689.0,"Activities, restaurants and bars, you'll find everything you're looking for within 10-15 minutes of walk from Järntorget. 

A few of my favorite bars spread across Linnégatans sidestreets. The Långgatan district is covered with local bars and restaurants and nothing beats Rosenlund when it comes to afterworks. In the evening there's plenty of activity around that area. Stigbergstorget definitely has some of the best venues for smaller concerts. 

This is where we meet up and spend most of our sparetime. Even if I live 30 minutes cross the city.

However, if you like to have drinks with suits*, Avenyn is your place to be. I don't think that's what you're looking for though? Mostly fine dining and electro music nightclubs. 
(Except Yaki-Da and HPKSM of course). 
You don't want to live too close to the Avenue (I grew up on the mainstreet). At later hours it's much safer to take a cab home from that area anyways. 

*Dresscode/expectations"
Gothenburg,fpp3yvi,t3_genpgc,1588795550.0,"For central areas Kungshöjd is definitely an area you should add to your list. It's inbetween Vallgatan and the Linné area. Haga is also a pearl, rarely anything for rent in that area though. Including Linné these would be the area I'd look at if I was working downtown.  

Make sure to have someone on location help you out once you've found a place. Let him/her go have a look. Subletting can be shady. 

If like to spend more time in nature you should have a look around Örgryte, Kålltorp and Lunden. Not much nightlife but the area is considered safe and family friendly. A normal paced walk from Vallgatan is 20-40 minute, Many commute by bicycle from here, there's a bicycle road all the way to downtown. Public transport would be 10-15 minutes, Stops at 1-4 am. With the lovely Delsjön/Skatås area, filled with sporting activities just around the corner it's definitely an area to check out. 


With your simple needs you shouldn't bother looking around Hisingen, Gamlestan, Frölunda, Högsbo, Mölndal. 

Johanneberg is a very large area, most parts are kind of dull. Vasastan is active but very loud and messy in my opinion. Not the safest of streets at later hours. Same goes for Avenue and it's side streets.


A low goretex walking shoe works great all year round. Not much slush, more like puddles here.

Just like in Canada you'll want to wear layers of clothing. A lighter down jacket and a waterproof jacket is your go-to during October to March. Rest of the year you'll simply have to wear a backpack and rely on the local forecast."

Wellthatsucks,fpedl74,t1_fpdvf3z,1588545428.0,"Just wrote a diary of a story I almost had forgot. :S

Me, 19y, First job, 6 months license, Second largest official Audi shop and workshop in my country. without any experience or introduction. Flat tires, simple reconding, wash and polish were my tasks. 

One day my boss threw me a pair of keys and said that a customer complained about his car fading to the left and that one of the wheels ""makes a sound"" above 120km/h. He wants someone to test drive it first before taking it to the workshop because he had been here before and he didn't want to come back a third time with the same problem. 

I was told to take his Audi TT up to 130 km/h (80mph), ""take my hands off the wheel"", listen for a sound and confirm that it's fine. Maximum speed here is 100km/h and there's heavy traffic at day. 

It was the first time I drove that fast and in a sportscar. I have no fucking clue why he let a random kid do that instead of a mechanic. I'd have lost my license instantly if I was caught.

But I did what he said, flew threw the speeding lane. Car did indeed take to the left so I rebalanced the wheels, took it for another drive and a wash then handed the keys to the customer. He said he had been watching me through the window and told me I did a great job. 

I worked really hard, learned quick and did far more than expected.  Bumped into customers cars a couple of times, messed up some machine, couple of wheels, no one really cared.  Boss seemed to like me, contract went out and he offered me a new fulltime permanent contract, I said no, cya. 

That place thaught me a good lesson for life. Take my time, be aware and never stress. If someone trusts me with their belongings, it's my very highest priority to make sure that I leave it in the same or better condition."

Har du har några specifika krav på miljö ex. närhet till hav, natur eller kanske mer nära till centrum och nattliv. 

Vilken arkitektur uppskattar du mer? Det finns ju landshövdingsområden, modernt och nybyggt eller tidlös arkitektur som du hittar i centrum. 

Om du är i Göteborg så rekommenderar jag att hyra en cykel och ta en tur igenom de områden du tror passar dig. Stressa inte beslutet att köpa din bostad.

Jag tycker själv att Lunden/Kålltorp/Örgryte är ett fantastiskt bostadsområde och att Kungshöjd eller (Nedre) Johanneberg har det bästa centrala läget. 

För mig var trygghet och nära till Delsjö området prio 1. Men det är många som drar sig mot Majorna och Linné istället det är också härliga områden.
