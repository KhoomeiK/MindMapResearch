It's obvious to me that suicide prevention has more to do with your economical value, you have to consume to survive, than the value of life.

smalldickproblems,f4rdfnh,t3_dljwhh,1571766075.0,"You're oversimplifying the situation. I'm sorry but that's my take on your post. You have to think about everyone in this condition. There are even some things we should fight for. Small penis shaming is one of them, this is a major issue and by saying ""people here are drama queens"" you're not helping at all. I'm happy that you could find a girlfriend, but there are plenty here who are struggling. Just because you did get to eventually move on, doesn't mean you should disregard people's pain.So let we grieve and let we write our tears down, let them rant. I know very little psychologists who will tell you ""you're just you being overdramatic"". No. This isn't how you treat people's pain, it might doesn't matter how small it might seem. Why are so many afraid of negativity ? Afraid of crying ? Crying and sharing exists for a reason, and that is to aliviate the tension, to seek for understanding. And to be fair, the problem is complex, some might have a good life, some might not. But all my simpathy for those who are struggling and if it depends on my opinion I say; this place will continue to be free of this dictatorship of positivity. Rant all you want, express yourselves, find understanding and sympathy.Positivity has it's place of course, but so does negativity, so does dispair, angst and pain. This is a place where people who feel hopeless, people who have just being rejected, who feel they will never have affection or love, who have been cheated on, laughed at, come for some confort and sympathy. I will always stand against people who will tell them; ""stop whining, you're being overdramatic, I did it so, so can you"". This is just oversimplistic and bitchy."

And I am saying this because I would, as I am also a gay guy with a smaller one. If he feels like he needs more you could try to use, as trans tops do, the help of toys, including straps, extensors and so on. On some sleeves you can still feel some friction. I don't see why some people say it's different than a penis... there are some real good copies out there. There are people, specially some women, who will claim that toys are even better than a real penis. As they can came in shapes specially designed for pleasure.

smallpenisproblems,f3stfeu,t3_dfrly8,1571108975.0,"Thiss this a good solution to the problem. But why is it different for us ? Because we are expected to have a penis. If we could only be viewed, as we are, less endowed genetically without any shame life would be much easier. If we could use toys or ask for a decent penis enlargement surgery, freely without the shame that cames with it. Without having to sneak our ways into, clearly, inaffective solutions. If we could say ""I have a small penis"" and instead of being laughed at, our condition could be understood as the problem that it really is. This sounds like a victim mentality ? because it is! It's time for us to recognise that we are victims of the genetical lottery, accept the downsides of the condition and ask for empathy.

And if you haven't accepted or seen this, please, use your brain. With that in mind people could sympathize better, it doesn't mean we would get sex or affection but we could lament our sorrows more honestly.

smalldickproblems,f3s5g5w,t1_f3q7k1g,1571097278.0,"Yes I agree! the biggest probability is that you're going go go through some pain because killing yourself is actually not that easy. Even if you put a bullet to your head there's enough evidence to say that you might still ""dream"" a little before actually ""passing"" (passing ?the subject is so uncertain...). There's a lot of literature about some near death experiences, specially in some religions (they real ? who can tell...). Lemme even tell a curious fact; in the ""interpretation of dreams"" Freud states that we may interpret some exterior extimulation as a different imagery, but related in our Dreams. That way an alarm clock becomes a church's bell ringing, or a sudden increase in temperature (as in a fever) might became a fire. And in this near death experiences literature, death will usually be described as cold, or that the touch of death is cold (could be seen as an angel, or a demon, a spectrum, depending on how the person's imaginary is constructed). That could be related to the fact that the body temperature will decrease and, if the brain is still ""dreaming"" somehow, the person will interpret the symptoms of death as imagery. That could mean you could even experience some pain and regret in this dreamy-like state and not be able to reverse the process, depending on how you do it. Or there might not be this kind of experience and you're not going to feel anything but some pain, depending on how you do it. Or there could really be angels, death itself, who could tell ? The whole subject is sorrounded with uncertainty. Maybe hell is fucking real. Sorry cause this is not helpful at all, I'm just agreeing and making some conversation I guess."

smalldickproblems,f3i2als,t1_f3h6t1i,1570931406.0,"I love Camus work, I marvel at the fact that he wanted to be called a novelist and not a philosopher. How instead of trying to create a whole new metaphysical system, he actually gave a damn and tried to ""save"" some people with his writting. As I told, at least to my subjectivity,  I'm here regardless. But if you'd rather not live than live a miserable life I understand you. Maybe even more, I can ralate to your pain. I totally respect your vision  because I understand how acute this pain can be. And who knows, maybe suicide is a good answer if life becomes nothing but miserable. Or maybe it's not.I can't say that with certainty at this moment of my life (and maybe I won't be able to say at any moment), at least regarding myself. But I can tell you that I will have a deep respect for whatever decision you make.

I would like to say one more thing; this discution is complex man... even if it comes down to us becoming lonely celibates maybe we don't need to lie down and rot. Maybe life can be good without sex or even romantic affection... what if this starts happening to a lot of people ?Maybe some incels will finally accept their ""fate"" and will start working productively to find ways to make life more bearable without sex. Maybe we could have some communities online where these celibates will reunite weekily to keep company to each other, is it that hard from happening ?Maybe we are indeed at the verge of an affection crises and female hypergamy will became the norm. Maybe then, we can form some communities of campanionship to feel less lonely ?We could meet at video games, or at weekly RPG quests ?. Is it the same ? of course it's not, but it could be fun... it could give us some meaning and a sense of belonging.(A lot of people here have given other suggestions). Or life could be truly miserable besides all atempts to make it bearable. But that is my whole point; the discution is complex man, the whole issue is very complex, there might be a lot to be said yet. So, and this is me talking about myself, I wouldn't make any major decision concerning this problem without some thorough consideration."
smalldickproblems,f3fs65i,t3_dgw57e,1570901778.0,"I sometimes get a little disappointed by seeing that many people think there is an entitlement to happiness and fulfillment. There isn't. Life was not made to be happy or fair, even for ""normal people"". Life began (kind of) as tribes of pre-historical human archetypes fighting their way through survival, and the less adapted, well, probably would starve to death or be thrown into complete isolation (among other cruel fates). Being able to have the modern life comforts (as easy accessible food) is a relatively new phenomenon. I won't go on in this thought process. My point is; Okey, life can be happy and fulfilling, but just for a selected few. Even normal people are pretty mediocre regarding being happy. And we have it worst, but hey, that's life. ""Everybody deserves to be happy"" is an (on a great deal an American) Illusion, life was never meant to be a quest for happiness.And after we developed certain intellectual capabilities life was not about survival either (hence suicide). Life is quite meaningless actually. So what about we ? Should we live with the burden of being deprived of affection and sex possibly our entire lives ? I don't know. My personal answer is, the last time I tried thinking about suicide I ended up on a philosophical maze. My conclusion was that I can neither justify committing suicide nor justify not committing suicide.The fact that I find myself unable to justify it happens for lack of knowledge actually (I think). Not that I haven't read, there are some decent published answers for this, Camus has his, Sartre his, Schopenhauer his... the list goes on. but I don't find them being the ultimate answer, they help a little but, that's about it. (c'mon who can possibly begin to give a very consistent answer the question ""is suicide justifiable ?"" Is this question even epistemologicaly consistent to begin with ?). But do I need justification to commit suicide? Yes, personally and intellectually I need philosophical justification, sorry guys.(unless I'm literally starving to death or something like that, in which case I'm not, I'm just under an underwhelming agony from time to time, but hey, that's life). Does pain justify suicide ? I personally have my own intellectual reasons to say ""I don't know"". So I'm stuck here, since this state of being alive is already upon myself and I can't justify the act needed for changing it. I just keep going, being life utter agony or not. My state has a lot of resemblence with Camus's  ""the myth of Sisyphus"" but I'm opposed to this specific line of the manuscript; ""the struggle alone towards the heights (the movement of going forward with life without a meaning at all) is enough to fill a men's heart"". No dear Camus, as much as I find your work brilliant, I don't agree with that line.My opinion is that the struggle alone is not enough to fill a men's heart.I keep going forward because, honestly, on a deeper level, I'm very obsessed with justification and making sense of things, and again, I can't justify the act of suicide and I also can't justify the act of not committing suicide.That should explain why I am here (and hopefully add a little to the discussion). I'm not here because I feel happy or fulfilled."

smalldickproblems,f3179mw,t3_df3uz0,1570569367.0,"Worning; please if you're feeling suicidal don't read this. Suicide is also not a solution, even if the things are hard, what you need now is to talk to someone who will understand your pain. This is actually me trying to give a solution to the problem, but it's not the ""sugary"" type of solution.   It's the let's face it type of solution.  I'm a gay guy with a small penis and let me say; there's ins't a solution in the sense that size does matter. They will give different sensations, anyone with a brain can see this. This is something some people of this community don't want to see. If you take sleeves ans straps out of the equation a man with a small dick will never be able to do what a man with a big one does. Life's not fair folks, genetic lottery was never meant to be fair, it was actually ment to be a process in which the less adapted characteristics to the environment should be eliminated. The ""weak"" should parish in a wild environment. Needless to say, we are not there anymore, we have language, we have morals, technology. To say that the weak should parish nowdays is not just dumb but utter cruelty. This is the kind of responsibility that comes with having a conscience. That said, I believe that the beginning of real a solution for the SD problem lies in acknowledging that this is a big deal, this is actually a serious problem. As I have said again and again, at it's worst, one experiencing this will never find sex or affection, will be mocked and treated as a second-rate human, not directly, but worse, from mockery and shame. At its worst a person carrying this burden will go through a spiral of self-hate, bruised self-steem, hopelessness and loneliness. There's no way of changing the reality of the sexual market's unbalance in favour of some desired traits, at least not now. This is the way it has always been, sexual partners are chosen under conditions. However treating this problem like a serious one (because it is) and providing society with a true notion of the problem will generate the kind of acceptance and kindness necessary to start forming a real solution. Maybe surgery will be considered a priority, thus more accessible. Maybe the sex toys taboo will go away with the shame of being ""less then a man"" for using them. (C'mon how did we come to define masculinity on something that no one has control of ? The ideal of Masculinity is indeed a little fragile and full of logical falacies). The hypervalue of the ""real thing"" will probably decrease. The jokes will eventually lessen and we will actually get sympathy from most mature people who understand the importance of acceptance (they exist folks). A small penis will still be a small penis, (unless surgery by that's just a long shot), however we will have the space to be understood on our sorrows. The space to consider alternatives. The space to find better ways to cope, and who knows, even find happiness. This looks like a real mature solution to me. Not the ""it's not the size of the boat"" bullshit."

I'm not able to do what some men do and that's it.When I have sex I will almost always to go through one the following; 1) being rejected because of it 2) compensate with toys or something if the person is ok with it 3)Be the bottom 4) there is always a small chance my partner won't care. I am coming with terms with this reality. It is a condition that sets me apart from ""normal"" guys. Also it's not my fault. As I have stated multiple times, life is unfair, genetics is unfair,c'est la vie. So what I am trying to say is, there's no point in being insecure when you have accepted your fate and the tragedies that inevitable come with it. My worst feeling is the anxiety that cames from the possibility of not having enough affection in my life and developing a kind of neurosis from the lack of it (does that exist ? Well paranoias aren't that rational). Rejection still hurts but you get used to the pain, it gets better over time, but I still advise you to grieve it every single time. I don't mind compensating, but I don't want to bottom every single time."

I think that it still doesn't matter for same people (I am one of those guys but, well I also have the condition so I am on a biased position). I will never care for dick size or even if the guy has a penis at all. Even when he wants to top. for casual sex and for relationships. This is a very personal preference. It's important to point out that don't want to impose any preferences on people. But in today's gay culture it's pretty clear that penis size is very important (I'm still questioning myself if that can be considered transfobic...).I will always refer to Ru Pauls drag race to prove my case but there are plenty of exemples. A very small minority won't think like that."
smalldickproblems,f2nc60b,t1_f2dyuuq,1570314264.0,"I do think that straight men have it worst than gay men. But we also suffer. I don't agree with the whole bottom top think but for pratical purpuses let's say I'm a versatile. So sure, I have the possibility of becoming just a bottom and half of the exclusive top population (which is not much) would except me (some still want you to have an avarage+ size dick, even when you're not going to use it). But what if they want to experiment ? You'll always face a certain paranoia that in a relationship they can use this against you. The safest place (I think) for guys like me in the gay community is to be with someone with the same condition. Or to find someone who can really be trusted and is nice about this.Also the gay community seems to be more accepting of toys which is sort of a way to deal with this (I thank trans tops for that). Casual sex can be very,very difficult but if you get used to the rejection eventually you can find something here and there.After a lot of silence and rejection.But the casual expirience is a far cry from the causual expirience of someone with an avarage+ dick . 95% of the time they will ask for nudes. Dick is by farr the most rejected attribute,and a big part of the gay community is obsessed with dicks. you can have any tipe of queen at Ru Paul's drag race,from all sizes and from all colors, but I garantee you, a small dick is always going to be a joke and something related to shame on this show.""Go bigger or go home"". It's very hypocrite (as some women tend to do, being very compassionate about some restricted body issues and very cruel about other ones (that said everyone has the right to reject, but jokes and laughing are something more...)).""If you can't love yourself..."" then goes to show many puns and jokes about something that no one has control of and servers a purpuse of being a mesure for rejection and hating... shows a lack of empathy, to say the least. At the end we will face a lot of common things; rejection, being treated like a second-rate human by a lot of people, and the risk of not fiding any affection at all. Even then I still think that straight men have it worse than us. And that bisexuals have it a little easier, in their case the dating pool is just bigger by default.But they go through the same things and still suffer. The most important thing that I would like to say, however, is this;  we face enough rejection from society already. if anything can be done about this problem I don't know, but seems to me that it would be good to at help each other a little. Having a community on reddit where we understand each other's (even when some have it worse) issues and being able to talk about it here freely is already something."

smalldickproblems,f25r9m8,t1_f25872r,1569981736.0,"I think that you don't need conditions to be kind and to love yourself. love should not be mistaken by indulgence or complete satisfaction with oneself. Parents (not all of them, but some do) love their children and still try to make them better people, but if they fail, they will continue to love their child regardless.Because it's more a feeling than a logical if this X is true than that Y happens kind of notion. Plus, having a small penis is a genetical trait you don't have control over it. But if you value yourself as a logical thinker, you will realise that a lot in your life is out of your control, a lot of it was pre-determined by the parental lottery.Merit is unfairly overvalued in today's society. Self love shoundn't be conditional, not in this absurd deterministic world. It is the least you could do for yourself. It doesn't need to come from help or big amounts of coping, it actually comes from being less hard on yourself, from your own forgiveness and kindness.Realizing why you should be less hard on yourself is very important for this.Clue; you didn't ask to be here, but you were born anyway, in a body you didn't choose, with parents you din't choose, brought up in a certain way (that accounts for a lot of who you are, ask psychology) that you didn't have control over, by perents that probably were not perfect (also not entirely their fault), and just existing can be, at times, a tremendous and very valid effort. so why be hard on yourself ?Some people do have it easier, but that's how things are. It is nobody's fault, the world is just very unfair.I hope this can lead you on why you should start being kinder towards yourself. Plus to be kind towards yourself and to forgive yourself can have a great affect on your mental health. I understand this is still a problem (mine, also) but this is a start.Treating yourself better as you are, (yes with all the traits that you consider negative) will allow you to think more constructively and to feel much less bad about this.The pain is still there (after all, it is a problem) but it hurts far less.Because even though a lot will reject you, you will not, and I can't begin telling you how your own rejection harms you.I have been there.Some people don't realize how oneself is one's most important company. I hope I was clear that loving oneself doesn't mean conflicting, being angry, or disapproving yourself sometimes. That is the thing about it, and you can see this in some parent-child relationships; love is, and should be, deeper than that."

And they will be told, almost anywhere, that if they were rejected based on appearence alone, this was cruelty.
