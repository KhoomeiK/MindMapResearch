Also usually when people post stuff like that they just mean that because they're busy at that moment so he wouldn't talk while he was out drinking but I'd guess he's open to everyone again today.

I think it would be fine, at worst you just message him and he doesn't open it for a while. It sounds like you're close already though so I think it's just anxiety talking there"

The one positive thing about this happening in public is even if anyone noticed you, you'll never see them again and they won't know who you are. Everyone will be busy going about their own lives, they won't have been paying attention - what happened will be different in your head to what other people saw because it was so awful for you but for everyone else they probably won't even remember seeing you now.

If I was in your shoes, that job seems like the best one you could get. It's a place you know, with people you already know and you're doing a job you already know how to do. If you can, it really does sound like the best option for you to go for.

The first day of a job is hard for anyone so hopefully your mum would understand if you can't do the kitchen today - is she usually supportive when you're having a tough time? Because I wouldn't be up to doing the kitchen on my first day either so I hope she can understand.

Anxiety,ez8zbqs,t3_d0exk9,1567767374.0,"What you've done this past month sounds amazing! Getting a job, going on trips, seeing friends - all of those are times when you've put your anxiety in its place and done whatever you wanted. You can keep going!

Part of it might be that you're literally just tired and in need of a rest - take today slow like you said and hopefully you'll feel a bit more ready for tomorrow. Its great that your friend is with you and knows what's going on, just be open with her if you're struggling and she'll be able to help you more than any of us because she actually knows you - lean on her if you need to.

If you're tired on the trip and need a quiet day, that's totally fine. You don't have to be busy all the time if you're not feeling up to much, maybe a quiet day could help you enjoy the rest of the trip more!

It sounds like you're doing great, even if it doesn't feel like it. I hope you have fun on the trip! If you do want a chat with someone my PM's are always open :)"

I always try to eat whenever I can if I'm in an anxious time - feeling a little better at 1AM? Eat something then. It doesn't matter what either, just whatever you can get down.

Definitely don't skip the days when you get called up - it's not worth missing all of other classes you have that day. Would it be possible to talk to the teacher/**someone** at school about getting out of it? Maybe on your day the teacher could just do it all herself - that way people wouldn't even notice anything was different I'm sure.

If you went up and did make a mistake, nothing bad would happen anyway though. Everyone makes mistakes on the board, I'm sure you don't think any less of them! No one thinks badly of you, and they definately won't be judging your body while you're up there doing it - they'll just be trying to follow the maths!

Anxiety,exsl3ey,t3_cua4v9,1566548259.0,"Ah you just described my anxiety perfectly...

The worst my anxiety has ever been was back in 2015/2016 and I went through exactly what you did before I went to school every day.

I'll be honest, it sucked. Nothing I did totally got rid of the feelings but a few things helped:


I chose not to eat any breakfast before I left the house because like you said it just made me feel even more sick. If you do that though make sure you have extra stuff in school because when the anxiety goes off as normal you're going going to be **hungry**!

This is probably more difficult to do on the train but I always tried to arrive at school right on time because my anxiety was always worse when I was at school but before classes started so I would try to minimise that time.

This one is less to make you feel less sick, but hopefully will make you feel better in your head. I brought a bag with me in my pocket so that *if* I was sick I would be ok. I never ever needed the bag but it was comforting to know it was there should the anxiety be too much.

What I found was the biggest healer for me was just time. I went from feeling anxious like you all morning to only feeling a bit of a flutter in my stomach that faded the moment I walked into the school gates. It will get better, you can do this!

I hope all goes well at school and the anxiety gets better like mine did because I'm sure you deserve much better than this :)"

Anxiety,exnscfo,t3_cttrtd,1566462729.0,"Just to make this clear from the start - I'm not religious. I went to church when I was little but was never really into it if you see what I mean.

I'm sorry your family are like this and they've said you're going to hell, you shouldn't have to live in this fear. This was a while ago so I could be wrong but didn't the pope come out in support of gay marriage? Surely that must mean that it is ok and you won't be sent to hell for it then right?

Just because you're gay doesn't make you weird or anything like that, it's okay. It's just you. You should be able to live your life the way you want to. You're not sick, you're just you and that's fantastic.

I hope you can find people in your real life to spend time with, even someone to spend your life with. I really hope you can start to challenge the way you think about yourself and your sexuality too - because it doesn't make you a monster, it just makes you you :)"

Clearly you can't be with him while your feelings about the abuser are so strong, do you think it would be possible to work through your feelings about it possibly with a professional? Because then maybe a relationship would be more possible between you two.

But again, I know you've fallen for him but it sounds like he's not understanding your side of the situation/it doesn't matter to him. I'm not sure I'd want to date someone like that.

Have you tried asking her what's wrong? If my friend seems distant, I usually say something like 'hey you don't seem like your normal self lately, is everything OK?'. She might just say everything's fine but because the question is very open, she should feel like she can tell you what's going on, either something on her own life or something between the two of you.

How long has she been like this? Try to think back, did anything happen between the two of you that could've caused this? Also is she like this with everyone or just you? If she's generally avoiding people then it will probably be something going on in her own life and nothing to do with you at all - just be patient with her and let her know she can talk to you and she might open up.

Hopefully the two of you will come back together naturally, just be patient with her and don't force her to talk to you if she doesn't want to yet."

Is your mum going? Because there's absolutely nothing wrong with sticking be her side the whole time - that way people won't just be talking to you, she's there too.

I had a family get-together yesterday so I know the feeling! It was alright though and I actually enjoyed seeing some of the people again so hopefully it'll be the same for you. Good luck!"
Anxiety,eud4z19,t1_eud4jl5,1563701679.0,"I know, it's the same with me! That's why I just say 'ill' with most people because they know what that's like and they just let it be.

The best kind of people will just accept that you're anxious, even if they don't understand it, and maybe help you through it.

It was still worth going though wasn't it? Try to remember that you felt OK once you were in there, don't let the anxiety take the good parts of the evening too!"
Anxiety,eud4a2w,t3_cfwa4q,1563700587.0,"You could still try right? As the other comment on here says (but in a bit of a blunt way) you want to change, maybe this girl could be the reason! You could start doing things with her to make yourself 'dateable'. Don't make her your one reason to do things but she could be the thing to start that ball rolling.

You said you've had a few long term relationships right? There's all the proof you need that you are dateable! You can do this!"
Anxiety,eud42el,t3_cfws6w,1563700251.0,"Can confirm, have done this...

I don't know what your anxiety is like but for me it makes me feel sick and I usually just tell people something like 'I'm feeling a bit ill but I'll be alright in a minute'. Usually this makes people drop it because it sounds like it will pass in a moment (as my anxiety does)

Usually I do feel embarrassed about it but if I say something like that, people don't dwell on it so it doesn't become a big thing"
Anxiety,eud3uap,t3_cfwx6z,1563699886.0,"Did your parents make you feel worthless growing up? Because if so, that's not healthy for you. I never like to jump on the Reddit hype of 'GO NO CONTACT' bur of that's how they treat you, maybe staying at uni for the summer isn't such a bad thing ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I'm definately shy too and I've had people tell me it makes me seem 'calm and relaxed' (not on the inside believe me!) but also 'passive and disinterested' which is heartbreaking for me because I love seeing people, even if I take a back seat in the conversation. When I'm in really small groups though, like 2-3 people, I find myself talking more. It's still challenging at times if I don't know them that well but once I know them a bit better I talk to them way more - is that something you could try, just you and a couple of people you want to get to know? Oh and also texting/sending messages online if another great way to get to know someone before you meet them.

I'm sure your gf's friends don't think you hate them. Not to scare you but your gf **WILL HAVE** told her friends about you so they know your just shy! Have you told your gf that you think her friends hate you? Maybe she can help with it.

You can do this! You're not worth less than anyone else, good luck!"

Anxiety,eu7d459,t3_cf533e,1563526885.0,"I get dizziness and a loss of appetite, I'm pretty sure I've heard people say they get hot flashes too so it certainly could be anxiety. Hang in there man"
Anxiety,eu466ox,t1_eu3vzjk,1563440483.0,Ah I'm the same! It's great that you can keep yourself together on the outside though!
Anxiety,eu0tqwl,t1_eu0n2u0,1563354813.0,"Not OP but wanted to ask anyway - is it possible that there's no deep fears? Because I've had anxiety issues for years and I've been to therapy but I've never been able to get any hints of anything deeper than just whatever happening in my life at the moment. It's got to the point where I'm thinking 'what if there's no cause, this is just what I'm like as a person'

Any thoughts?"
Anxiety,eu0tdc9,t3_ce9q6l,1563354636.0,"The best thing for you right now sounds like you keep the appointment and make it to the doctors! Try to focus on that (what you want to say, what you hope to get out of the appointment etc) and forget about everything after that until after. The doctors are there to help you and they'll do everything they can to make you feel comfortable.

You haven't actually got this job yet have you? If not, they'll surely be considering other applicants as well so if you drop out it probably means less work for them now. If you just say something like 'an opportunity has come up that might help be get into college so unfortunately I will not be able to take the job' them I'm sure they'll understand.

Try take this one step at a time, it sounds like you're on the road to good things though! Good luck!"
Anxiety,eu0sicv,t3_cea6gb,1563354180.0,Yay! Great that you told him! Good luck with your exam too 😁
Anxiety,etexlt9,t3_cbea9n,1562751807.0,"You can do this!

First of all I'm sure nothing will go wrong but even if it does, you'll be strong enough to deal with it. You and your friends will all be together and can handle whatever problems the fair and city transport can throw at you!

Try and get some sleep if you can, and good luck!"
Anxiety,et8y0hp,t1_et8qgav,1562576077.0,I'm not OP but thank you for this 😊
Anxiety,et8xx2z,t3_cahb1f,1562575930.0,"You said it youself:

>I have a boyfriend who loves me for who I am

He loves you flaws and all! Maybe it's hard  for you to see but there will be so many great things about you and that's why he stays, that's why he loves you and that's why you deserve him. 

There's nothing wrong with telling him what his flaws are, just make sure you're doing it in a positive way. Don't tear him down, build him up.

You've done great with your master's, I hope you know that! Good luck with the new job 😁"
Anxiety,esrozpr,t3_c8zus3,1562231954.0,"Of course I don't know your situation but your parents will probably be the best as long as they're supportive. Maybe a close friend if you want as well.

Your school should have some sort of support system for its students so they're definately worth reaching out to, they might be able to help you in ways you haven't even considered so I definately recommend them!

If you don't reach out to anyone else though, you're always welcome to post here 😁"
Anxiety,esropm0,t3_c90e47,1562231683.0,That's great! Keep going!
Anxiety,eskbzkn,t3_c85tyl,1562059095.0,"I'm sorry you feel that way, and that your mom reacts like that. Your friends are still your friends though and I'm sure you'll be able to laugh at memes with them again!

Is moving out an option for you? It might seem like an overreaction to your mom yelling but it sounds like you aren't happy at home anyway and the change might do you good?

I hope things get better for you!"
Anxiety,eskbb9h,t1_esj7jo5,1562058318.0,Thanks for the reply! I'd rather not be dependent on medication either but I've tried CBT and it wasn't as successful for me I don't think (still helped me but only to a point) so like you say I think I might go to my GP to explore other options
Anxiety,esiedx9,t1_esi9qnw,1562012109.0,"Thank you so much for the advice! I've done some research of my own as well and apparently SSRI's usually get prescribed first here, from your description I think I'd want to start with those anyway!

I do agree though they don't treat the issue itself, I've tried that though and I'm not sure it's helped me too much... Just wanting to explore other options

Thanks again!"
Anxiety,esi7pnz,t1_esi7aqn,1562008396.0,"I was thinking the same yes, might be time to give it a go. I'm not seeing a councilor at the moment but I have done in the past and would be open to it again.

Thanks for the advice!"
Anxiety,es5s9ly,t3_c62e3t,1561625697.0,"If you're having a hard time, it's ok to talk about it! You don't have to announce it to a whole group of people of you don't want - just one or two that you trust the most. The only way you'll give off negative/downer energy is if your anxiety is all you talk about, you can still talk about it but don't let it dominate every single conversation.

I hope you find someone to talk to, but if you can't then you can always post here 😁"
Anxiety,es0jh6l,t1_es0ifwi,1561476715.0,That's great! Glad I could help 😁
Anxiety,es065cw,t1_es057bo,1561466896.0,Ah you're welcome 😁 happy I could help!
Anxiety,es04s9e,t1_es04i4p,1561465646.0,"Ah I'm sorry to hear that, just remember then that it's not your responsibility to be the child she wants. If she can't accept you, that's her issue. Try not to let it affect how you view yourself"
Anxiety,es02px5,t1_es026vx,1561463601.0,"It's good that you're happy, I'm sure your mother just wants what's best for you too but she's not expressing her feeling in a good way by making you feel guilty. Maybe you could tell her that you're happy and you hope because of that she won't guilt you as much?

Taking a next step will be tough, but it's a step into bigger and better things. Hopefully once you take this step, you'll be even happier. (and also it might get your mother off your back a bit!)"
