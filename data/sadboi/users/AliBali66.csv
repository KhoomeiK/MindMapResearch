AskReddit,fhqhyxo,t3_f47gmb,1581804494.0,I remind myself that being angry with someone is dangerous to my health & that it's better to flatter a fool than fight with one. Sometimes it even works and that's when I feel best
SuicideWatch,f8p4m72,t3_e13h41,1574695580.0,"Hi, I really hope that you don't go through with your plan and I do feel your pain. I understand how it feels to be so low that nothing feels worthwhile. I have tried suicide on more than 1 occasion. As I write now I am 53 so old enough to be your grandmother. 
If I was your grandmother I know I would love you and be completely devastated if you carried out your plan to kill yourself just as I know that family members would have been devastated if I had succeeded in killing myself then or now, and believe me I still have the thoughts, ideas to do this a lot of the time. People I love and who love me don't know how I feel but I know a few would be totally distraught if I did & my dogs keep me keeping on for now.
You haven't written much so I don't know your reasons for feeling the way you do just now so I can't say that things are going to get better, today, tomorrow, next week, month, or year. However, they may well do.
Is there anyone you trust enough to be able to talk to about how you're feeling just now. I hope you do have someone because it seems that it would be such a waste of your young life if you do this.
Lots of people, including me, on here have been touched by your pain and want you to reconsider what you plan to do.
Please come back to the thread, we would like to help you see that it's possible that things might get better if only you'd give us a chance.
Thinking of you with hope.üíù"

I wouldn't want my daughter to go through that but at the same time think she'd be best off without me. 
My dogs keep me alive. They need me. Going to bed is the best part of my day, waking up the worst. 
I just feel hopeless, useless and lost"
SuicideWatch,f8cg8cu,t1_f8c9u2e,1574459576.0,Same. Only my dogs keep me here. They need me.
SuicideWatch,f8cfzeb,t3_e05a1k,1574459423.0,The best time of my day is going to sleep. The worst is waking up again in the morning. Wish I could sleep forever. I don't like being here anymore.
depression_help,f5r2zqa,t3_dorm7y,1572387240.0,"Is this a one off, or a regular occurrence, depression has many faces, don't put this down to a bad day unless it is a bad, sad day. Seek help. Praying to a God I don't believe in that you get professional help and are honest and most importantly, listened to. Don't ignore the signs. Depression is a killer. You know already. Advice given above by the bot is your best answer I've seen for you. No offence but the other 2 replies are subjective on personal beliefs. I don't know the answer either but I believe you need more than ""I think it's sadness"" Look out for and do what you feel in your gut. Depression is overwhelming, all consuming and crippling, sometimes for days/hours at a time and difficult to diagnose reading a paragraph, it always comes back though and just when you might think, ""oh that was a sh*t day or so but I feel okay today or right now......... boom it's back. Hopeless, useless and lost. It can't be diagnosed by asking a question on a forum or by grtting a couple of comments on this forum (however well meaning) Tomorrow you could feel fine but you have to do what's best and right for you. Don't begin a cycle of downward spirals because you might feel you are just sad, hard enough to deal with. Depression or sadness, you need someone to hear you, you need to hear yourself. I'm not going to pseudo diagnose you, please take care of you."
