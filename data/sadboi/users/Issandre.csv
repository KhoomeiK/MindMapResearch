I don't know what is it with people who believe that we should respect our parents just because they're our parents, even though many of them are really assholes. We should only respect those who actually care about us and don't ruin our life. Hopefully your stepdad gets what he deserves."
Anxiety,fkd9jh3,t1_fkd8z85,1584071911.0,"This is what happened to me. I must admit at first I was worried about some problems I was having and maybe that triggered my anxiety. Eventually I just stopped thinking about them and even though I had nothing in my mind, I would feel like my throat is closing and chest pain. Suddenly I stopped having any panic attacks, but it was hell. I hope you get better! Patience is the key."

So, if it helps, remember my case and don't lose your head over some irrational thoughts. I did go crazy, to be honest, but it wasn't worth it."
