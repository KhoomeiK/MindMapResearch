TryingForABaby,fr3755y,t3_gmeolq,1589851298.0,"the primary difference  between prenatal vitamins for women and regular vitamins for women is the inclusion of folic acid (some have omega 3 as well).

The prenatal vitamins do not increase a woman's chance of conceiving. Folic acid is necessary for proper spinal development in embryos. A lot of this spinal development occurs before a woman knows she is pregnant, which is why you take them while trying to conceive. Her body builds up a reservoir of folic acid for prepare for proper development, and hence a reduced risk of miscarriage.

Since you will not be pregnant, there is no need for you to build up a reservoir of nutrients.

There might be a certain mineral or vitamins that helps with Male fertility, but prenatal vitamins are for making pregnancy easier and not necessarily conception."

The issue isn't whether or not porn is feminist (it isn't but that's not the point) the issue is that you, as the other partner, are bothered by it. If something makes you feel uncomfortable or hurts your feelings, as a loving partner the other person should at least be willing to listen.

GenderCritical,fqxttdr,t3_gldnug,1589737755.0,"Porn is like a sociological experiment that has never been done before.

For most of human history, a man would likely only have sex with a few women in his lifetime. This would also require him to ""prove his worth"" and have a woman's father approve of him. I'm not saying that such a method is sunshine and roses, but at least sex was seen as a goal you work towards, and not something you deserved.

The powerful elites would have access to dozens if not hundreds of women, but this was rare. Further, (and I'm not saying this justifies concubines) in order to have access to so many women you either needed to be born in a position of power or obtain power with challenging tasks. Again, this is not justified since many of those sexual engagements were coerced; but my point is that you had to ""earn"" a woman's body (even if it meant earning it in the eyes of another man).

Nowadays, the average North American man has seen more nude women than even powerful Kings did back in the day. This level of sexual promiscuity is unprecedented.

Further, because it is so easy to access a woman's body (all you need is an internet connection) it creates an entitlement mentality. No wonder we see so many ""nice guys"" act like victims when their female friends dont have sex with them. It not only leads men to devalue women (which is the primary problem) but it even leads them to devalue sex. Sexual stimulation is easier to access than a pizza."

One of the best aesthetic decisions I made for myself was get laser hair removal on my armpits.

I was hesitant at first because I knew that my armpit hair was a natural part of my body. But the laser doesn't make the hair completely go away. It makes it grow slower and it wont grow past an inch. I only ""need"" to shave about once every two weeks, but unless I'm wearing a sleeveless top, I usually go about a month or two between shaves.

I had really bushy armpit hair. It would get very sweaty if I let it grow out. It could also be itchy. 

However, because it was so bushy, shaving took long time and I often accidentally cut myself. I also found that the itchiness was even worse after shaving. 

Both shaving and growing it out were uncomfortable. 

If I'm honest, did social pressure to be ""clean shaven"" and ""delicate"" play a role? Of course it did and there is no point in lying. It's obviously tough in our society to expose our armpit hair and not feel ashamed of something natural or to feel it is unfeminine. Despite the fact that the majority of women have armpit hair unless they are children, so biologically its adult vs. child rather than Male vs. Female.

But it wasnt fully about society's expectations either. I feel a lot less itchy and a lot less sweaty. I feel more confident and comfortable in clothing. I also have the convience of not having to buy rasers as often, and I save quite a but of time in the shower.

So while social expectations were a factor, I'm glad I did it nonetheless. Even if I never wore another short sleeved shirt in my life, I'd still be glad I did it just for the comfort alone. I am also glad that I am not completely hairless, but still retain some hair (makes me feel womanly and not like a baby). 

Bottom line, I think there are lots of reasons people make the fashion decisions they do. There's nothing inherently wrong or non-feminist with removing your hair, especially of your hair is bothering you physically."

3 grains of rice minus one is still a pile. So 2 grains of rice there is still a pile

2 grains of rice minus one is still a pile. So one grain of rice is a pile. 

The point is we can't keep subtracting one grain of rice indefinitely. Likewise, at some point we have to draw the line and say this is too young to consent to sex. 

I'd say given how much being in porn can come back to haunt you, 18 is still quite young to be making such a decision. The bar is already set pretty low.

Years after he died my mother and aunt were raped by a man and my grandma pretended it didn't happen, and continued to let him see her daughters. Given what I know about my grandpa; I suspect he would have stepped up to defend his daughters.

So on the one hand, my grandma was abusive while my grandpa wasn't. On the other, it was a man who worsened that abuse by raping my mother and aunt. 

It definitely is more complex than ""woman good, men bad"", and there are times where that bias can affect courts. On the other hand, there are times when a father IS dangerous and yet he is still allowed to see his children.

It's not an easy clear cut thing, and there are likely judges with biases in favour of men, meanwhile there are also judges with biases in favour of women.

It's hard to have studies and research on trans people if there is no clear definition l
of what a ""trans person"" is. 

I suppose the best that can be done is that waxh researcher could define what in means in the context of their study. But then they'd have to refuse some people and that would get them backlash because they are implying some people aren't  ""really trans"" (unless the only criteria is self-identification)."

She did have a genetic condition that made one breast not grow, so it was not merely cosmetic but also ""affirming"". Nonetheless it's so tragic that such a thing happened. Maybe if she had been born a few decades later the surgery might have been safer."
GenderCritical,fojl5wn,t1_foja353,1587823740.0,"Ok but in this case she needed a way to distinguish between women and TIMs/transgender.

I think adding the qualifier ""genetic"" women does sound silly but that is the world we live in, where we actually need to distinguish between women and trans males, and sometimes we have to use weird words to do so.

For instance, in the case of Rachel Dolezal, we might have to use silly terms like ""real black people"" or ""genetic black people"" to distinguish between transracial people and ethnic minorities. Does it sound silly? Yes. Is it actually needed for clarification? Yes. 

Language needs to be clear and concise. In a society where people can't seem to agree on what makes a woman a woman, qualifiers such as ""genetic women"" may be necessary. I personally use the term ""cis-women"" but I usually put it in quotes to indicate it is a term borrowed from elsewhere and not my first choice of words."
