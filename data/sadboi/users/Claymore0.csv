I know you just mean to point out the general problem with violence and I actually agree with you. But a small act of aggression (perhaps not actual violence) is a very fast way to stop a bad pattern early on. 
Most parents don't want to hit their kids, neither do I, but if a toddler for ex. Is obsessed with outlets, it makes sense to apply a literal slap on the wrist to teach your child an essential facet of electrical safety.
Does that make sense?"

I have depression right? Like most of us, and I always thought that was a bad thing. But I learned on reddit that some scientists think that depression evolved as a way to avoid plagues in europe. So if I think about my giving into depression (isolating, being lazy, eating+, but not forgetting hygiene) as a survival tactic, I become proud that I can survive this disaster very comfortably because I'm depressed and like to be alone.

AMA,fltiotd,t1_fljhn95,1585474561.0,"How about a better answer: 
Dream journal
Sleep more
Daydream
Wake up early
Schedule your sleep.

I'm not as vivid or creative as this guy, but I have my experience with lucid dreams. Except for me it only happens frequently if I do the work for it.
I'll explain.
As op said, in one of these you just ""wake up"" in the dream. But it's to varying degrees of awareness, sometimes you can barely remember to fly. Normal people going lucid is dependent on
1. how well rested you are 
           Sleeping 9 hours
           Going to bed and waking on a schedule
           Following the sun to bed
2. How easily your brain recognizes dreams
          Dream journal (helps you remember and see patterns)
          Daydream (maybe, it's something I did a lot at the time, maybe unrelated)
          Internet tricks: (like learning to recognize dreams by looking at your watch)

So when I do most of these things together I'll go from maybe a dream a night that I remember a little to four detailed dreams a night in which I might be lucid in one or two."
