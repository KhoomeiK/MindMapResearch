Speaking of dressing up at home, I was missing wearing lipstick since I wear a mask every time I leave the house, so I put on some super garish lipstick and was living my best life today. I was just getting stoned at home, but whenever I caught myself passing by a mirror, I'd look approvingly at my reflection and give myself a little wink."
Indiemakeupandmore,fqd9ser,t1_fqd98fv,1589284306.0,There's more chocolate and Coke when first applied. It's mostly amber as it dries down. I probably wrote the review right after I swiped it on my wrist. :)
Indiemakeupandmore,fqctqcu,t1_fq9mygh,1589268642.0,"\*Rubs hands together vigorously\* Ahh yes, let's consult my spreadsheet!

**Demonseed Cake** *-Italian Lemon E/O, Candied Lime Zest, Bergamot E/O, Black Poppyseed, Marshmallow, drop of clove and a hint of White Musk Cake Batter.* 

Lemon poppyseed! Musky poppyseed with a bit of lemon. Ooh, spicy clove musk in the drydown. Good for daytime.

&#x200B;

**Devil Cake** *-Chocolate Cake, Chocolate Frosting, Sugar, Evil and Cocoa dust.*

Very much like BPAL Bliss but a tiny bit richer, more toothy. Bliss is a little more subtle and drier. So this is like dark chocolate frosting, while Bliss is like a chocolate cupcake.

&#x200B;

**Etherian Ambre** *-Amber (NA  Studio Accord), Cola Root, Sarsaparilla Root, Black Patchouli Wood,  White Vetiver, Bastet’s Amber Absolute, Vanilla Pod, Cacao Bean and  Australian Sandalwood.*

Earthy, woody, chocolate-y Coke. But soft and wrapped up in a cloud of slightly sweet, vanillic amber. I love the thread of vetiver in this. Very versatile, unobtrusive, and easy to wear. Great as a sleep scent."
Indiemakeupandmore,fqcqrt2,t3_gi1mvu,1589265894.0,"I'm so excited for you! When I get a bunch of new stuff, I'll start opening them right away and smelling things in the vial or bottle. If I don't immediately like it, I'll let it rest. If it smells good, I'll start testing it on my arm right then. I'll only test one per arm, and I'll take copious notes. I'll write down how it smells as soon as I apply it, then write down how it smells after it's dried on my arm, then keep sniffing my arm to see if it morphs over the next couple of hours.

From last year's Lupers. I definitely got a high-end Japanese incense feel, with a hint of cherry and rose.

&#x200B;

**NAVA Private Universe** *(NA Oudh agarwood, Santalum sandalwood absolute, Cardamom, Teakwood, Cedarwood, White Patchouli, Black Clove and eNVie saphir amber musk)*

LE from a couple months ago. Sorry I keep coming up with ones that aren't currently available haha. But at least the search will give you something to do during the quarantine! To me, this is calming, spa-like, dry, leathery woods.

&#x200B;

**NAVA Eternal Ankh Black** *(White Amber, Powdered and reconstructed oil of Egyptian Vanilla Husk, Vanilla fleck, African White Vanilla, Black Agarwood, NA Oudh essence and Black Patchouli Absolute)*

LE from a couple months ago. Primarily white amber and oudh/agarwood, rounded out by vanilla and patchouli.

&#x200B;

**NAVA Dark Matter** *(Black Jasmine, Vanilla Bean Liqueur, Egyptian Cardamom, Black Agarwood essence, Oudh essence, Bastet’s Musk, Bastet’s Amber, Burning Wood embers, Saffron Attar, Bourbon Vanille Absolute, Black and White Patchouli blend, Indian Jasmine Absolute and Bourbon Vanilla Beans.)*

This was released as a FWP sample during NAVA's Spring LE collection, which is still on. It got a lot of love in the NAVA Facebook group! In my perfume notes, I just wrote, ""THIS IS THE SHIT."" They are going to release bottles of Dark Matter when they come back from moving their store to another state. They said they'd be back by Halloween."

I didn't like Hex Mossypeach because it was too sweet, but Egoyomi has a deepness that reminds me of the pit. It smells (I almost wrote ""tastes"" lol. I just put it on my wrist to test it and I seriously want to eat it.) more real and less synthetic. Mossypeach is also more clean and smelled like a shampoo to me. Egoyomi is more complex. I think the sandalwood helps a lot in that regard.

( u/divaslo Here's my take on Egoyomi) Oh, and I love Alleviate the Frenzy as well! I guess I'm more of a peach aficionado than I thought."

When a new collection comes online, I'll look at the notes and sometimes I'll pass on it altogether (happens more lately, as I have a better idea of what I like) or I'll buy a few. I do end up wearing my newest perfumes for about three weeks. Once I get bored of them, I'll hunt through my stash to change it up.

I'm not suffering from as severe of a depression as your daughter, but my dad was an alcoholic and his depression is much worse than mine. It sounds like your daughter's life wasn't easy, and it must have been difficult to care for her sometimes. Thank you for loving her and being a good dad. 

My dad and I aren't on bad terms, but he's not very open or vulnerable. He's kind of a stoic guy and it's really difficult to talk to him about anything other than where we're going to eat dinner. Also, he lives in another country so we don't see each other very much. Your daughter was very lucky to have you in this world."

Some GCs:

**BPAL Twilight** *- Lavender and jasmine, with a touch of glowing honeysuckle.*

**BPAL Wilde** *- A sophisticated traditional gentleman’s cologne, with just the slightest taint of patchouli’s passion, tonka bean’s decadence, the philanthropy of bergamot, moss’ cynicism, the sharp wit of lavender, and the hopeless romantic longing of jasmine and thyme.*"

Indiemakeupandmore,fi39mgd,t1_fi1alzo,1582107831.0,"NAVA has several different kinds of vanillas, ambers, musks, and sandalwoods. You can get them as a single note or as bases for their more complex perfumes. Their scents are usually well-blended and sophisticated and run the gamut from super-foodie to masculine-woody. I really love their Bastet's Ice Cream (BIC)- and Delicieux (cake)-based scents, as well as their Santalum (sandalwood) scents. I also hoard anything that has sweetgrass, neroli, mango, or blueberry notes."
