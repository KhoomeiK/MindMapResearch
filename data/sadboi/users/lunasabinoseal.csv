AmItheAsshole,fr5vuz6,t3_gmmlv7,1589915524.0,"While I support pushing your daughter towards body acceptance, your refusal to allow her to adopt a healthy lifestyle seems more damaging than your sister helping her out.  Even if you are a bit on the chubby side, you can still tone your muscles and improve your physical condition, which will make you healthier. 

Also, you refuse to eat vegetables, or a vegetable-based diet because it is more expensive? It is more expensive on the long run to develop health issues from a unbalanced diet. Also, I don't know where are you from, but buying vegetables and seeds in bulk is cheaper than buying meat or processed foods where I live. Also, you mentioned that you enjoy gardening? Then why not plant your own vegetables? That way your daughter would be able to spend time with the family while supporting the diet that she wants. 

Believe me, it is as unhealthy to try and force somebody into acceptibg a body when they can actually improve it (not by thinning out, but by going physical condition), as it is to try to  change it beyond what's feasible.

Edit: YTA, Op, sorry."

A bloody nose is not life threatening and I bet somebody else can take him to see a doctor, or he can drive himself in the morning (I'm not sure where you're at, but hell, he could even Uber himself there). 

To hell with his illness, that's no excuse, you have to take care of yourself. You already tried to be the bigger person and talk to him, made concessions, and he's still not changing. Unless he accepts that what he is doing is harming people, he is not going to change.

You look like somebody who is not used to doing things themselves, which is fine.
