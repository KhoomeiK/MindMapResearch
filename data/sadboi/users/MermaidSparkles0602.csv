BPD,fnair30,t3_g0mpdt,1586798218.0,"And I quote:

throwawayboy60000 to me:
“I’m so sorry people were saying that you manipulated them is triggering. You poor thing. That must be so hard for you. I’m sure you’ve triggered the people you’ve treated like garbage. No one was being unkind in the comment section.  Everyone was being extremely fair and you’re just mad that people have opinions that are different to from yours. It’s ok though, keep blaming your disorder on everything and being terrible to people!”

1: I never once said that I manipulated anybody. And I don’t, anymore than a regular person does, everyone in the planet manipulated to a degree without knowing it, it’s human. However It isn’t a very prominent part of my BPD or person at all. What I said was I FELT like I had because I feel unlovable so there is no logical other way in my head that anyone could love me without me manipulating them somehow. Which isn’t true but is a FEELING borne of low self worth. So you entirely misunderstood that.

2: I don’t treat people like “garbage”. I argue with my partner sometimes as we all do, and I have dark spirals when I’m depressed and sometimes I say mean things when I’m down there. It’s something I’m working on and I take full responsibility for that, but other than that I have never done anything to consciously harm another human being. So again, you’re wrong.

3: You also have NO idea what I live with from my partner and the abuse I’ve dealt with from him and other men so don’t judge.

4: No, there were comments in there that were completely uncalled for and could have been phrased in a kinder way to the people those comments were aimed at. Again you’re wrong.

5: I never ever blame my BPD for my behaviours. I can pinpoint which parts of my behaviours are caused by my BPD and I make myself aware of it and I work on it. I acknowledge but I never blame or use it. And my partner could tell you so.

6: You know absolutely nothing about me yet you felt the need to get some chips off your shoulder at me for no apparent reason. You’ve been unkind, judgmental and disrespectful. So I hope people on this group are kinder to you than you are to them"

BPD,fn9iuaq,t1_fn56skn,1586774675.0,"Thank you so much for this ❤️
I truly appreciate it!

So weirdly you mentioned sleep, diet and physical exercise, and those theee things are things I constantly try to change but end up failing with.
I grew up very very fit, years of ballet and other dancing, weight lifting, 4 hours a day at the gym kind of stupid fit!
I went through trauma around age 20 and since then have had issues with b12 deficiency, chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. I suddenly stopped being able to exercise at all, and since putting 4 stone on due to sertraline (thanks!!) in 2016.
 I’ve been trying to lose that and also focus on trying to gain back strength and flexibility. Feeling weak physically is a HUGE trigger for my self esteem and self worth.
I guess if I feel stronger physically I feel stronger emotionally.
So far it’s taken me 18mnths to lose two stone (two more to go! Whoop!) but not being able to exercise properly is so frustrating. I can do 20 mins yoga, 20 pushups and some squats and not be able to move for 4 days 😖
I miss weight lifting and yoga so so bad!

As for sleep and nutrition, I’ve been trying to focus on anti anxiety foods and getting some sort of sleep routine. Difficult because I have to wait for my partner to get home around midnight and our schedules don’t tie up too well. But this lockdown is helping a little with sleep!

I also grew up Mormon so there were some huge pressure there involving having kids and being married etc, it was expected quite young. 
I’m working on getting all that shit out of my head and trying to change my mental standards I hold myself to 

So I’m actually a singer/songwriter and I do enjoy that but I’ve not made time for it until the last year or two due to extra trauma and my business (self employed and it take every inch of my time).
I’m getting back into it slowly and it is helping, you’re right there!

That is so interesting about kind of changing the expectation goalposts....not revolving success around work/relationships etc.
I’m going to keep that in mind, it’s really helpful thank you ❤️"
BPD,fn9hgck,t3_fzwrh9,1586773157.0,"You know what’s really disheartening?
That somebody has come here with an issue (a real one that many people struggle with) and is just being judged (mainly by people who have quote “been on the other side of it”) unfairly.

There are SO many judgmental comment in this thread and to be quite honest it’s incredibly triggering for me and I’m sure it is for others too.
Nobody comes here to be judged, but to have kind, open discussions.

I do not feel OP was “bragging” at all, not in the slightest. He/she even stated they feel bad about it but can’t seem to stop doing it.
Is this not a HUGE issue with a lot of BPD traits? Behaviour issues that are extremely difficult to control due to the mental stem of them?
So why is everyone judging right now when you too probably have other uncontrollable issues that YOU struggle with?

If you’ve been on the other end of it, then I feel for you. I too have been on the other end of it.
BUT getting your back up and being unkind and judgmental is for Facebook and Twitter, not this thread.

This just makes me really sad.

To OP - I totally understand you. I constantly feel like a horrendous person because I feel like I have an insatiable need for love, and it will never be enough. So I understand that feeling of needing or wanting people to fall in love with you etc, I think in some level it’s how you feel connected to the world and feel worth something? 
I often feel like I’ve “trapped” or “tricked” my partner into falling in love with me. I look back often and question whether I was manipulating him into loving me or whether he actually is in love with me. But I think a HUGE pointer here is that I FEEL like I’ve manipulated him because I don’t feel worth loving so I MUST have manipulated him. If that makes sense.
In reality, I think I was more easy going and more myself when there wasn’t such a deep emotional connection, but once it started becoming official, the BPD abandonment brain started kicking in and that’s when I started feeling unlovable hence the “trapping” feeling.

However, I told him at the start that I am very difficult once in a relationship, and I don’t think he understood quite how difficult hence 5 years of many ups and downs, but he is starting to understand little by little how to see my triggers and spirals etc and help me avoid them in little ways, seeing them before I do sometimes.
I still get a need for attention from other people sometimes (nobody in particular, it’s just a destructive feeling) now but it tends to be when I’m either in a Self destructive spiral or feel I’m not getting enough love or attention from him. 
(As it is, I talk to him and am very clear when I’m feeling fragile and need more attention)
It is never something I seek out of act on due to being in a relationship and very much in love with my man, and it isn’t something I want, but I think that constant insatiable need for love and loving attention or wanting to be wanted may never go away and it’s how I feel worth something if there is always someone interested.
It’s a dark thing that I’m trying very hard to eliminate from my mind, and very difficult to do so, but the fact that I acknowledge it and can pinpoint why and when it’s happening is a first step, and then I guess the next step is finding ways to work on that.

If anyone here has any helpful tips of how to work your brain around that terrible need for love to feel worth something, I’m sure it’d be much appreciated by lots of people here.
It’d be more helpful than most of these judgemental comments"

My partner (little bit of background - he has been a drug addict and liar/gaslighted for the last 3.5 years of our nearly 5 years relationship, causing me massive trauma which I don’t think he realises truly) just made the decision to go to a band practice with some new people on Monday instead of spending the evening with me (I thought it might have been the last of our two full days a week he has with me due to a new job that may have started the following week) and I lost my shit.

I’ve barely spoken to him since and he has been cold and hard and it’s making me so much worse than I would be if he were reassuring and caring.

I know it’s a silly little thing but to me it feels like a massive pivotal moment - like after everything he has done (and he is only 90 days sober)....it feels like he is yet again choosing something over me. It so hard to deal with because I know I’m over reacting but my feelings are so real

He is either the best person in the world or the worst,
No in between. He is the person who loves me and would never hurt me, or the person who gaslights and lies.... it’s just another completely different person and I find it so hard to put the two into one human being
