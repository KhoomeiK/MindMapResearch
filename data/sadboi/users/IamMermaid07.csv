domesticviolence,fcr0b66,t1_fcozrxu,1577894893.0,"Im leaving him, but not the home. I’m the one legally bind to that place . I cant kick him out because were married. For now I’m sleeping in my kids room. I left early this morning to just stay out of the house. The plan for now is to be gone all day , drive around part somewhere idk I dont have anyone do it’s just me. My kid doesn’t know what he did and has sided with him since we started arguing 3 days ago. My neck and head hurt, I’m not sure if it’s bc of what he did or sleeping in a different bed. This shit sucks. 

Got’cha, it would make sense if that’s the environment he was raised in. I think my husband said his dad would hit his mom, I cant remember. They separated when he was four. Over the few years he’s just turned into a monster. 

I hope you’re able to get out soon. This can break you . I sometimes feel there’s no fixing me. 

Good Luck 🙏🏻"
domesticviolence,fcoyodj,t3_ehvkmw,1577845247.0,"I’ll it worse. I felt mine “isn’t ” abuse and nothing major. Today while laying in bed he slammed a bag of dog food on my head hitting me to the mid back. He threw it at me two the three times grabbed me by my foot and yanked me out the bed. I’m in the closet now until he falls asleep. 

He started with the hair  and hitting me on my legs, but mostly because I’ll cradle into a ball to cover my face. Recently got my lip then today this.  I compared my stories to others and felt it isn’t that bad . But  if we don’t leave, IT WILL be that bad or worse! 

Im not sure what’s your point pointing out his relationship with his mother. Mine worships the ground she walks on, he’s still physically and verbally abuse to me. 

Leave him! Today I say enough and officially done, there’s no turning back."
