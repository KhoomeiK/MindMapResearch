It sounds like your dad is overextending to his family because he was upbringing was kind of messed up. I hope you don't internalize any of that. I do understand that not hearing any of those words from your own father and him not being there is hurtful.

Do you feel insecure being your dad did not express that you're pretty or beautiful? What parts of your childhood and upbringing do you feel like you missed out on because he wasn't there all the time? You said he loves you, which ways do you wish he showed you he loved you more?

askwomenadvice,fqqhyy0,t3_gk5m60,1589565841.0,"Ugh, that's very cruel and hurtful. Was the fight regarding the baby or related to pregnancy? The best apologies are changed behavior. Has his behavior changed postively?

This be an unpopular perspective and I do not mean to invalidate your side, but he was likely affected by the miscarriage so him saying that can rooted from something else. Did your loved ones check up on him as well (if they knew about it)? Can he be resentful that no one cared about him when the miscarriage happened? He may have some repressed feelings regarding the miscarriage. If your relationship isn't usually this bad, then maybe it was just pent up anger communicated in an awful way.

Do you want to forgive him? Do you want him in your and your baby's life? If I was in this situation, I would have a serious conversation with him that comments like these are not okay at all. If he is feeling a certain way, he has to communicate in a less hurtful way. If he really doesn't want to be in the baby's life, then I'm not going to beg him. But he cannot speak to me or about the baby like that.

""I would love to support you right now, but I'm working on my own anxieties currently.""

""I care for you, and do not mean to disregard you, but I cannot have this conversation right now.""

If it's via text: ""I've read your messages. I'm not ignoring you and I'll respond to you when I'm in a better place.""

I also want to echo a previous comment. It's important to reflect whether these people care and put energy and efforts towards you. Do they care about your problems? Do they ask how you're doing? It's not selfish to not want to help or listen to everyone, especially people who can't even take the time to ask you how you're doing or ask if it's ok if they dump their problems on you.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fqqg7kf,t3_gjzswl,1589564973.0,"I can relate to the aspect of feeling like I almost always have to initiate conversations with friends first. It really bothered me. I do have my close friends but even with those friends, I have to initiate often. At this beginning of this quarantine, I felt like if people are just home all day, why don't they start conversation? But then I realized, this is such a crazy situation going on, I can't expect people that from people. Just because people are home, doesn't mean they're not doing anything or they're not dealing with personal stuff. Even some of my friends express that they're so bored and I would question why don't they initiate conversation. I, too, did not feel like talking to people often and just keeping some distance from my phone because I don't feel like interacting with people. So thinking of the situation from a different perspective helped. Also before covid, I would tell friends straight up that I wish they started conversation more and it feels like I'm the one mainly putting in effort and that helped in some areas. It sounds like those 2 friends want to talk to you again, so I would suggest building on those friendships."

I'm not sticking up for her behavior but just because she isn't working, she may have other stuff on her plate and not ignoring you on purpose.

It does sound like you two are leading very differently lives and if the friendship isn't resonating with you or isn't bringing value to your life, maybe it's time for some time and distance apart. It doesn't necessarily mean ghosting - it can just mean time apart and resuming together if that's what you both see fit.

Also, it hurts so much realizing you have to cut her off because she was a friend so she had some value and you had some connection with her. Friendship breaks suck more than relationship break ups, in my opinion."
askwomenadvice,fp856yr,t3_gbib7l,1588383807.0,"How about thinking of some goals that you have outside of work and how you can achieve those? Start there. Do you have any fitness goals or something you've been wanting to try? Personal growth goals? Trying new recipes in the kitchen don't have to be expensive and it's not like you're throwing $ away because you get to eat your result. 

I thrive off being productive, especially when it comes to school or work. I felt better about myself when I'm productive. School or work have consumed so much of my life now during this quarantine things have changed that up since I'm not working. I keep reminding myself being productive and working isn't the only point of life. I can spend this time towards my other goals such as learning to play the guitar or learning new recipes. I spend a fair amount of time watching a funny show and I don't feel bad about that!"

He said they've never complimented one another? Ok, that has to be a lie."
askwomenadvice,fp84bix,t3_gbhaqs,1588383112.0,"Sit with the feeling, explore why you feel this way. You can keep busy with work or spending time with people but if that feeling is following it'll be hard to completely enjoy the things you're doing.

That's what I'm doing. I wanted a boyfriend pretty badly and I ended up in a bad, unhealthy relationship. I told myself I don't want to date again until I'm in a better spot which means having to explore these thoughts. I constantly wanted validation and attention from a partner. I've been working on seeking that validation in myself and exploring why I had this desire for a partner so bad. While it was uncomfortable at first, it feels so stinking good now!"

askwomenadvice,fp7czat,t3_gbj6ig,1588368307.0,"I would personally appreciate a charitable donation in my parent's name. Or food so we don't have to worry about cooking. Something to take the load off my family's back during this time or something to commemorate and remember my loved one.

I like the comment about gifting a living plant. I'm a plant lover so I would appreciate that. It feels good to take care of and nurture a plant and watch it thrive and grow. Also, a flower arrangement wouldn't really be put to use for me. In my culture, we don't give or receive flower arrangements when someone passes away. So just my 2 cents. If she is from a culture where flower arrangements are a thing during this time, then I think it would be appropriate."
AmItheAsshole,fp7bznh,t3_gbl3wk,1588367773.0,"NTA. From the information provided, it sounded like you told him the truth about his behavior towards women instead of making it about his diagnosis or how he was raised. It sounds like a straightforward way of talking about the behavior which I think is better than sugarcoating it."
MakeupAddiction,fp76us0,t1_fp746fv,1588365124.0,"No one is being morally policed here - I asked what can I do to advocate or how do others make sure they're buying from ethical companies, if you don't have an answer to the question, then don't answer the post. If you don't care about being ethical or environmentally sustainable, then don't read the post. But people not caring about the issues are the exact reason why they continue. People do not care and do not speak up to companies and continue to buy their products. It can be something as simple and free as reaching out to the companies. I said nothing about buying expensive products. I don't care to know your budget and don't try to play victim here. You're privileged enough to buy make-up so you're privileged enough to have a voice to companies you buy from."
askwomenadvice,fp6ecqs,t3_gb5bp6,1588350885.0,"Nah, don't minimize your feelings. A connection is a connection. Whether you met him in person or not, he made you feel happy or special, etc. Also, being ghosted sucks. 9 out of 10 times the person blames themselves and thinks it's something he/she did wrong when he/she get ghosted."
MakeupAddiction,fp65a7x,t1_fp4r4p2,1588346327.0,"That exact mindset contributes to the problem. By not saying anything to companies or advocating to others as the consumer we’re basically okay with these ethical issues. If you’re aware of child labor taking place so you can have make up, and an issue that has been brought to light, we can try to do something about. As humans we need to do better, rather than just being complacent about these issues and continuing to use products we know are being made this way."
