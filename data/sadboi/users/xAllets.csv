community,fqo593q,t1_fqo0zu3,1589507834.0,"Omg same here! i‚Äôm watching Glow right now to avoid finishing community because I don‚Äôt want to be so sad lol. You can only watch a show for the first time once, so it‚Äôs special like that. I‚Äôll love rewatching it but it‚Äôs just not the same in that sense."

BPD,f8f49ym,t3_e0h7hm,1574538056.0,"Lol, I got drunk last night and it was the worst thing ever. I ended up in bed crying telling someone I loved them, telling them to leave me. Unrelated, I wanted to kill myself because I was having a BPD fit (feeling unlovable, alone, etc) then after I sobered up I just kept laughing about how much of a mess I am. I‚Äôm never drinking again lol."
