That's why I replied (I don't answer to everybody just because they want to go to the UK!). Anyway, all the best and good luck!"

In D. ist es ok, bierernst zu bleiben, aber das wirkt in UK etwas steif. Bitte, das sind keine ""hard and fast rules"", nur kleine Tipps mit auf den Weg. Die Zeiten sind schwierig. Ich wünsche Dir was :-)"

IWantOut,fp2j3sh,t3_gaxmrg,1588262631.0,"Hey man, Brighton is London by the Sea, one hour by Thameslink to London, so that you can be there quickly. I would look for virtual contacts in the programming area you are specialised in and join online before you need to leave Switzerland. Once you have made contact in something like mining (not bit-coin, the process), real meetings may become a thing and you are in - your Swiss nationality will never be an issue in the UK. If they give you a project, just move to Brighton and start looking for a proper flat (I suggest Hove) - with the project and your Swissness you will have no problems. But I emphasise - get the job in writing first (work at first from CH)."

bigdickproblems,fp27fpb,t3_gasoor,1588256647.0,"Yeah, so amongst dicks there are sticks and swells. They end up with the same delivery and being the same thing. At my school, your game was known as ""battleships"", but I can relate to it. You get a stick on your shoulders - no sweat. Nobody ever questioned this, because it gave no indication as to stick or swell. The main thing was (with us) the game. And actually - half of us couldn't care less what was on our shoulders (no thoughts), the other half (incl. me) had our thoughts, but they didn't (at that moment) matter. I have been through countless ""battleships""-fights without this ever having been a point of discussion."
