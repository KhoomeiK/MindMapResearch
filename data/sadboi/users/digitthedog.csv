worldnews,eu7yxi0,t1_eu3yl57,1563546114.0,"I'm left libertarian in my political outlook, and my impression is that you are some type of libertarian, and I don't think we are far apart in our concerns in general.  I'm passionate about protecting individual rights, though I also believe in a proactive role of government in protecting both individuals and the community.  

In your Bob example, yes I think he has a right to a body in good health, but I don't think that right relates in any way to his behavior choices.  Put another way, his human right to individual health does not rise or fall in relation to good or bad behavior any more than a right to fair trial rises or falls in relation to criminal conduct. As a right, it is essential to him.  As a benefit in life, good health is something we need to take responsibility for as individuals if we are to enjoy it.  The role of society in securing the good health is to provide social resources that provide the conditions for the individual to achieve good health, and though it can (in theory) secure the right to health, it cannot secure the health of individuals, both because of their potentially unhealthy behavior, but more fundamentally because of the biological, natural realities of what good health is.

When it comes to him being able to tap into government funded healthcare, we must take care of Bob.  We cannot have a behavioral litmus test for access to healthcare, which is something that would have implications for all of us who don't behave perfectly with respect to our health, not just those like Bob who are profoundly irresponsible.  

As a side note, you might be interested to know if Bob is an active smoker he could not get access to a lung transplant.  I believe all lung transplant programs would refuse him unless he stops...I think it's for two years.  They do drug testing for smokers.  Because donated lung are limited and scarce, I think this is an entirely fair way to distribute social resources, an approach that holds Bob responsible for his behavior.  So rights to healthcare are sometimes circumscribed based on behavior, and I think that is reasonable.  I do not think that because he is a smoker, he should be denied access to other treatments through government sponsored health care short of lung transplant."
worldnews,eu3a4nk,t1_eu38r07,1563409281.0,"I'm enjoying the conversation too - it's helping me clarify my opinion.  

I don't think UltraPlague is that extreme a case as it might sound to some people - it is ""ultra"", but only the extension of characteristics of existing diseases.  I hope I'm in the 2%.

It is a challenging case to my position from the standpoint of logic but not from the standpoint of a common sense and a reasonable approach to the concept of a health human right.  No, we're not going to quarantine the 98%, but we will provide significant social resources to the 2% to help them avoid infection.  I'm not sure what that would be, but conceptually that would be an example of manifesting that right.  Perhaps it would mean, for example, workplace accommodations to create a buffer between them and the infected.  This is an ominous suggestion given Holocaust, but would it make sense to have the infected wear a bracelet, to help the uninfected avoid infection?  

So I see it a slider between diminishment of some other human rights for the infected balanced with the right to health on the part of the uninfected.  

In general, I think you're taking my belief in a health human right to be structured absolutely, when really it's goal and constantly negotiated through social relationships, political process and government."
worldnews,eu37qnt,t1_eu34ah3,1563407516.0,"Rejecting health as a human right puts you at odds with commonly understood enumerations of human rights, for example by the UN and the WHO, not that that necessarily matters to you per se.  My point is simply that my assertion of that specific right is consistent with broad, global consensus of human rights.  

I don't agree with your case where someone where unintentionally transmitting a disease would be a violation of the recipients human rights - that's not within the scope of the right as I see it.  I see the right in terms of an individuals relationship to the community and to the state.  You have a right, for example, not to be subjected to mass sterilization, for example.  You have the right access to clean water.

It's possible that we may be in fundamental disagreement over what constitutes a human right and what the implications are when something is described that way.  For example, here's the OHCHR's detailed definition of health rights starting on page 3:

I doubt influenza would evolve in that direction, but I can definitely envision an ancient virus unleashed through melting ice that triggers a homicidal impulse in humans.

To me the statement ""public health outweighs human rights"" is a not-quite-right representation of what I'm getting at because it puts the two concepts at loggerheads when they are not.

I seriously doubt that his failure to do the exercises caused the pneumothorax or has had much impact on the performance of his lungs at this stage in the game, so don't get down on yourself about his failure to do those exercises.

Not good that he's changing his med schedule at this stage, because it needs to be aligned to his blood draws, but the key is that he is getting his tactrolimis or cyclosporine level checked exactly 12 hours after taking it the night before, so they can accurately adjust those meds.  That didn't cause his pneumothorax either.  

You're right: he must be in compliance with the directions given to him by his team and he needs to take care of himself in general.  This is especially true in the first year as he's getting used to things, and while his anti-rejection doses are very high.  For example, down the road he may decide not to wear a mask but it's critical he do so for the time being as directed by the program because of his level of immunosuppression.

Like others here said, talking to a therapist or the program's social worker is a good idea.  If he has depression it will be hard for him to stay in compliance.  An anti-depressant can be very helpful for depression as well as general mood stabilization.

I feel your desperation.  But this is a marathon not a sprint and it's critical that you take care of yourself, be careful not to take too much on in terms of responsibility for his behavior, talk to the program social worker if you need support yourself and consider finding a support group for caregivers - helps a lot to talk these things through.

It's so strange that young people in their 20s and 30s are increasingly getting colon cancer.  Just had a colonoscopy myself (I'm 53) - I'm beginning to think they should lower the date for suggested screenings."

It broke my WiFi dongle - very old drivers for that so not surprised.  Sound works fine.  I didn't have USB3 before so that still doesn't work but I'm going to try and get that going next.  Works flawlessly so far."

Until you know more, avoid getting too involved in future scenarios that haven't happened yet and may not even happen.  Stay in today.  I'm hoping it proves to be something that you can heal from quickly."

BiPAP provides the same benefits as intubation but is non-invasive, a key benefit being able to talk briefly when you take the mask off.  BiPAP pulls gas out of the lungs and pushes it in, whereas CPAP only pushes it in (positive pressure)."

worldnews,ertsrkz,t1_ertofl5,1561252149.0,"That's a good example and why I used the word ""typically"" in that sentence, and we're agreed that many alternative therapies are not scientifically proven.  I think the vast majority of time chiropracty is harmless and sometimes helpful, but it can definitely do damage and I would advise friends against it.  Some of it is absolute quackery, like the ""activator"" method."
pics,ertcow4,t3_c3qb97,1561238685.0,"Am I the only one who looks at some of the images posted here (particularly landscapes) and experiences post-processing in a way that constrains enjoyment and disrupts the subject?  I mean, it's such a beautifully composed image but the intense sunsetiness is inconsistent with how I encounter sunsets with my eyes.  A less processed-beyond-reality version of the same image would be very beautiful too, and perhaps more so by reflecting reality more accurately.  I realize all photography involves manipulation of light, but I can also see with my eyes when an image diverts from what we see out in the world.  I know this has probably been said a million times here, but not by me."
worldnews,ert4nri,t1_erslmxz,1561232343.0,"I agree on a certain level: there's anti-science attitude in both.  But it most definitely is not the same shit.  Vaccines are scientifically proven to prevent illness and death; alternative remedies, whether they work or not, typically do not do harm the user the same way.  Opposition to vaccines and concerns about vaccine injury actually hurt other people besides the skeptic and their children, especially the immunocompromised, infants and people who cannot get vaccines for medical reasons.  Alternative remedies would only do harm to the user, for example, by not getting mainstream cancer treatments and using instead in some quackery.  Anti-vaxx is way more awful and impactful."

She came up with her own patent ""medicine"" containing laudanum and got in trouble with the Medical Society, which prohibited selling such things.  I have letters between her and her husband, also a doctor, from during the war, and she talks about using it herself.  Weird to think of my distant ancestors being high."
transplant,erpplgi,t3_c37h24,1561124834.0,"If I'm understanding the scenario correctly, it seems like maybe your best chance of building a support team would be where your mom lives and the surgery would be done.  Does your mom have social connections (friends, church, etc.) that could be used to build a support network?  The advantage of that would be you would both be benefitting from the support, so could you extend the amount of time post-transplant you could stay there?

It's such a kind and beautiful thing that you are considering doing this."

transplant,erljhxu,t1_erlj24h,1560988845.0,I can understand why you would feel worse about those cases compared to a case of someone who has the disease of alcoholism.  It's a pretty common perspective.  I agree about the issue of stigmatizing around alcoholism - the same is true of lung transplant and smoking.  I don't agree that Hep C is a source of stigmatizing because most people have no clue about Hep C or it's causes!
transplant,erliq35,t1_erlg4do,1560988247.0,"The problem with this type of an approach is that people might get the impression that you are saying alcoholism is a moral failure, when in fact alcoholism is a disease."
