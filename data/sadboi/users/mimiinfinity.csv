Anxiety,ffopdlt,t1_ffonck8,1580080134.0,Totally understand....the problem is that we're doing all this hard work for someone else...not for us directly...we need to change up the current social structure so people dont slay way their entire lives so coca cola or apple and samsung or ford can be around 300 years after we die...but what are the chances of a drastic social structure  change happening in my lifetime?!
albania,ffok88i,t3_eu6feh,1580078469.0,How can the problem be goverment? Government is just a group of albanians...if the gov is replaced then id be replaced by just another group of albanians...the problem hard as it is ..its to admit is that albanians need to change thier philosophies about life...hanging on to antiquated traditions as their identity and propose...gotta be able to take the good from the past and change the bad...thats how you move forward...its starts with the cultures philosophies about itself and life not about changing gov...gov is the last step

Anxiety,ffnt7mt,t3_eu3izb,1580070479.0,"Yes i felt that way for 25 years...i recognized it as self deprication...steming from low self love and self esteem...i was conctantly anxiously waiting for the other shoe to drop and when it did not drop i would sabotage myself to ease the anxiety....and validate the low self asteem that told me i dont deserve happines and peace without constant sacrifice and misery...being that way for 25 years will never fully go away but ive learned to recognize it for what it is and i combat it now with the thought of ""just do the best you can u can untill u cant anymore then find a way out"" that gives me peace when this anxiety kicks in"
