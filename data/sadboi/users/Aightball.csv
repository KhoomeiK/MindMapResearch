January 19th: got so cold I couldn't get warm.  Blamed it on the fact I live in Iowa and it was polar vortex time.  But the posts I made from then on talk about how miserable I was, this is the worst sinus infection I've ever had.  It went to my chest within a few days, which is unusual for me.  From there, I was MISERABLE from about the last week of January until a few days after Valentine's Day.

I had aches, chills, low grade fever, muscle spasms in my back (which is sort of normal but not as often as I had them), and a dry, persistent cough.  My sinus headaches have never been worse.  I got it from a coworker and at least one other came down with it.  My SO got it and we rarely share germs.  He didn't have it quite as bad but still had the nasty cough. 

Then, a few days past Valentine's Day, I got stuffed up.  Okay, it's like a normal cold now.  But when the mucous kicked in, good lord.  I've never had that much crap get coughed out of my lungs and chest.  And it was a noticeable recovery, because people at work started commenting 'you look better' and 'you're feeling better'.  I've been sick my whole life but this was a new level of sick.

All test were negative, including influenza.  And I know a LOT of people with the same story.  With international travel what it is and with this virus tracing back to October in China (if we can believe China, of course), there's no reason it wasn't circulating.  I'm not a virologist and so I don't know all the answers.  But I highly doubt this just started in January in the States.

I'm pretty sure I had a mild version of it in January/February.  It started January 19th when I got COLD.  I blamed it on the weather, since it was polar vortex cold.  But symptoms kept coming.  Okay, fine, it's a sinus infection, typical stuff for me.  But it went to my chest within a few days, which is highly unusual.  I had a low fever, which is odd; I either run a fever or I don't.  Dry, persistent cough.  Body aches, chills, felt like garbage for two and a half to three weeks.  And then I had two weeks of a normal cold, but the mucous production was off the charts.  And it went around work and my house like lightning.  I don't know where I was exposed but suspect it was a doctor's office, as I'd driven Dad for his appointments prior to the onset.  

&#x200B;

AskReddit,fkbh4pn,t1_fkberkm,1584032885.0,"This sounds similar to something I had in February.  I'm prone to sinus infections and so when my cough got worse everyone shipped me to the doctor.  I had a low-grade fever, coughs, and off and on body aches/chills for a few days.  Then I felt better.  When it came roaring back, it was the same but with some congestion.  I'm still coughing because spring and asthma, but it makes me wonder."

This is normal in the early days.  I lost my Mom in 2018 and those first days and weeks were hell.  I, too, wanted her to walk in and tell me this was all a bad dream.  Seeing her the first time we got to view her was a shock.  

&#x200B;

I hope you can find ways to find comfort.  I have a ""Mom"" playlist that is filed with songs that help me with grief, not necessarily ones she liked.  In time, you might consider something like that.  But for now, it's okay to cry and scream and do whatever it takes to relieve some of the fear and stress."

I have made myself only watch my state's public health page and did look at the statements by Dr. Fauci from the government level.  It was all practical and it did help me calm down.

I'm curious to see now what will happen with Papa IV.  I'm not crazy about the face paint/mask...I get now that it's based on a rat's skull, but the Plague was the theme for Prequelle...how is that going to carry over to the next album?  

&#x200B;

For me, the new mask/paint is a little too...overdone?  The lips and cheeks don't work together well for me.  I'm certainly no expert but he looks a little too over done for me.  But I'm willing to give it a chance to grow on me.  And I do think there will be some tweaks between now and the next tour.

But the video coming out of the show last night is amazing!!  Surfing YouTube this morning over breakfast, trying to find more videos of the unveiling.  I like how they did it on stage, especially with the bits of tux flying, haha.  The music is also fun, kind of ethereal, and yep, it's Abba, haha.

I really liked Papa III and the Cardinal, so we'll see how I like Papa IV.  I love the vestments, but again, am not sold on the mask/paint."

Today eggs and cheese rolled into a tortilla shell sat well; tomorrow it might not.  I've never tried to find my triggers, I guess, but it will literally change day-to-day.  Sometimes it's the time of day.  Sometimes my system's in a bad mood.  Sometimes it's stress.  I can go for weeks and poop like a normal person, which is very refreshing.  And then here comes the IBS-D as if to say ""don't worry, I didn't forget about you, vacation's over now!"".  It's frustrating and I understand where you're coming from.  I don't know what to tell you, other than keep trying to figure out what you can have on a consistent basis.

For me, I know it's the difference between relieving what's coming or risking a more embarrassing situation by having an accident.  Knock on wood that, as an adult, I've only had one accident and thankfully, no one was around but me.  So when I'm in public and my IBS-D flares up, I've had to learn to stop worrying about others walking in.  I just get in there and let it go.  Over time, you'll get more comfortable with it.

Overall, I think you have a clear story here.  It sounds interesting and I'm curious to see where this journey will take me.  I made some in-line comments, in italics, for clarity or to eliminate wordiness.  I think if I had to suggest a change I'd see if you can bring a little more into the end...you mention that he must participate in seedy spectacles, but how does that all relate back to the house?  Obviously you don't want to give too much away but I think you can give us a bit more there.
