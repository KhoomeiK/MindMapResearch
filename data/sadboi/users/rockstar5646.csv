Unexpected,fi2h1m5,t1_fi21ldi,1582079580.0,"Suicidal people are idiots and this weird world is romanticizing it. You're right, committing suicide is selfish, and stupid. It does nothing but hurt the only people that ever gave a fuck about you. All that results is the suffering of family, and a bunch of randos pressing 'F' and moving on with their lives. No one is going to feel sorry for you, you're not making a statement, shit, in about 5 minutes, everyone is going to forget u ever even existed. Except the people that you're supposed to stay alive for. 

&#x200B;

You have to stay alive for your family. Most people are too scared to commit suicide and wouldn't actually ever be able to go through with it, but the few that are stupid enough to actually do it, well, they made a mistake."
