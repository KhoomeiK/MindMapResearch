Advice,fpew9zu,t3_gcldyz,1588556322.0,"My advice is trusting medical science.
Transexual people (transgender is a broader term, I will talk about transexuals as you said your nephew is FtM) present an incongruity between their brain and their body. Simply put. 
This incongruity causes the infamous gender dysphoria. For instance, you might have the brain of a male and seeing your body being female would make you feel that everything in your body is just out of place and, often times, your genitals and secondary sexual characters such as breasts don't belong there. The brain is proven to be perfectly healthy and neurotypical, but doesn't match the body, the latter being the only part that can be changed to fix the incongruity without damaging the mental health of the individual. Is your nephew transexual? If that's the case, try to understand transexual people first, step by step. Acknowledging that it's not a choice but instead a very misunderstood condition is a good start. I am transexual myself, MtF, my very slow transition through the NHS was a success for my mental health. The only thing that makes me feel sad, now, isn't within my body but outside instead - people refusing to acknowledge successful stories such as mine because of motivations that range from political or religious to personal.
I believe that happens because transexual individuals are completely misunderstood, sometimes thought to play with their identity just to feel special or just being sick in the head. Just reading my lines above might give you an insight as to why that is incorrect and how aware of ourselves we actually are. Hope that helps.

Have a good day,

Heva"

OpenChristian,folnwsg,t3_g85rg8,1587866387.0,"Hello,

I remember Jesus Christ accepting all, even people that at that time were considered damned such as prostitutes and lepers. He simply said ""love your neighbour as yourself"". He accepted everyone, unconditionally. For technical and historical reasons, transgender people (and in general LGBT) at that time had yet to understand the very concept of gender and orientation, let alone manifest themselves. But I am sure Jesus would have accepted them as he did with everyone else, his message was pure and unquestionable.
Therefore I believe that those not accepting transgender people are the ones questioning the New Testament and thus proving to be very un-Christian.
Live your life happily now that your body finally matches your soul and do what Christianity truly expects its faithful to do: spread love, peace, acceptance. Love yourself as you would love another, in your specific case. :)
I am trans myself and I did find love. Everybody in this world deserves it, sometimes they just have to set on a quest to find it.

Big hugs,

Heva"

Look, speak with your sibling once you two are done shaking it off. Talking is the only way to understand each others, as we cannot really know anything from the outside... you two, on the other hand, can come to way better conclusions if you speak with your hearts. Have you told your sibling how much love you feel, in the same way you posted it here? That usually is the best start. Getting angry because you used a deadname so soon after a coming out was wrong, but think about it... perhaps your sibling has already experienced that from a beloved friend/crush and it still hurts. Mental illnesses don't help coping with it either. 
Talking in an empathetic but honest way can do miracles, I am sure you can do this. Amor vincit omnia! I wish you luck."

However, I always apply a simple filter of contextualisation. 
The question I ask myself everytime is the following: has this game achieved the best it could on the console it was designed at its time?
If the answer is yes, it is worth of playing regardless, because its graphics will leave you speechless no matter what you are used to.
Baldur's Gate: Shadows of Amn is one of those games. The menus are incredible, each item's icon unique and captivating (something I have found on very few games nowadays), the sprites just ahead of their time, the scenarios partially manually painted. Enter a temple of Lathander and be amased at every single polished piece of detail.
Cast any spell and see how addicting it becomes when you notice the great variety of effects (Protection from Evil being one of my favourites).

The most fun combination I tried so far is a Shadowdancer lvl.9 dual classed into cleric. You hide, buff up, backstab, repeat, support... and you could potentially scout ahead if you give up on lockpicking.
Fighter/cleric and Figher>Cleric are also a beautiful combination and very powerful.
For BG1, I would also enioy a pure cleric, perhaps a Cleric of Helm, if I remember correctly that one should have some nice True Sight spells and a very good sword conjuration that basically makes you a proficient fighter for some rounds."
