The dumping of milk has to do with commercial use milk that would normally be distributed to restaurants in large bags (think garbage bag size).
As for the killing piglets news... I haven't read about that but the toilet paper shortage was actually true. Someone tipped people off. Instead of producing commercial toilet paper (like company Kimberly Clarke and such) many people were suddenly at home and consuming much more household toilet paper than ever before and those paper products are supplied by completely different companies."
