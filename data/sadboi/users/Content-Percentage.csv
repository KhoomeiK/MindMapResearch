Anxiety,ffxh02n,t3_evo5ec,1580324964.0,"I am the same way in relationships always wanting to know what's on my partners mind and what they are up to.  Also I think the majority of people would feel uncomfortable if their partner was talking to an ex.  It would personally give me a lot of anxiety.  

That being said it's important for each of you to have your own friend groups and interests.  Try not to feel like you need to do everything as a couple.  Having more independence might help you feel more in control.  This may also help with your anxiety that if for some reason the relationship doesn't work out, you will have your own friends to fall back on.  Which you likely already have.  That's what has worked best for me, just remembering it's okay to not have everything together in a relationship.

Besides that continue going to therapy and finding what medications work best for you.  You are on the right track and that's something you should be proud of."
Anxiety,ffumnqu,t3_ev8k42,1580245187.0,Remember people are not judging you anywhere near the amount you judge yourself.  A lot of them are also busy being over critical of themselves.
Anxiety,ffulgfs,t3_euub8p,1580244453.0,Not silly at all.  As someone who also gets a ton of anxiety around phone calls I think you handled it perfectly.
