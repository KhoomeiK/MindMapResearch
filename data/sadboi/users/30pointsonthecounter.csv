innout,etv9kny,t3_cbch48,1563229688.0,"At my store in NorCal, my manager is typically looking for someone who can keep the dining room sparkling clean, stocked up, and has managed to get at least a few compliments while working DR. I got my host raise after getting 2 compliments that were called in and a few more where the customer asked to speak to the manager in person. The key to getting the host raise IMO is to go above and beyond for the customer as well as encourage customers to call in their compliments, as those are more official than in person compliments. A trick that I teach everyone I train as a host is when a customer is trying to tip you, grab a fry bag, circle the number to call on the side of the bag, and write something along the lines of “Thank you so much for coming in! Call this number to let them know about the service you received...” and write your name there too so they don’t forget! As for keeping the actual dining room looking good, just don’t let yourself get bored out there & constantly find something to improve. Spend extra time taking care of the customers and ask the second or third order taker to bring you whatever you need, get a restroom check, or take a lap in the DR. Good Luck!!"

Initially it took about 3 months for me to actually be put on board, 9ish months of training maybe once every few weeks, and then finally 2 months of very consistent training. IMO the quality of your burgers and generally how good you are at board is way more important to focus on than just how quickly you get your raise. That was my biggest mistake. I got caught up and discouraged by people who haven’t been working as long as I have leveling up quicker than me, but once I really focused on perfecting my own board I found myself consistently improving. Good luck!

Edit: My intuition was correct, I got my level 5 today!!"

I’m a woman of small stature and my body fat just doesn’t distribute straight to my ass/boobs. I’ve definitely become more and more self conscious of my body as I see influencers and celebrities with this unrealistic body posted all over social media."
