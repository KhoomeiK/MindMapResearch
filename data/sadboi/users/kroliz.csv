lookoftheday,fmbic3r,t1_fmbfzte,1585926943.0,"Sure! For me, it’s always about using a light hand and less makeup than you’d think. That’s gonna help you get a soft look. My concealer is Tarte shape rape and I use a beauty blender/sponge to blend it. Then I set everything with L’Oréal True Match powder. I apply the powder until my foundation is no longer sticky, but it’s personal preference. I applied bronzer to the sides of my forehead and under the cheek bones and my blush is Bobby Brown (I don’t think they sell the shade i use anymore unfortunately). I use a fluffy brush for that and just lightly apply, using soft strokes. I use a brow pencil from It Cosmetics and just very lightly outline my brows and feather the color for a more natural look. Just soft strokes with the pencil. And then set them with a clear gel. For the eyes, I just used soft browns cuz I feel like that’s most flattering for my eye color. Hold your eye shadow brush from the end and that will help it go on lightly and blend nice and pretty. And use tiny circles when applying. I use a light brown color in the crease and a dark brown in the crease and outer corner of the eye, just remembering to use a light hand and build up the color slowly. My mascara is Maybeline Falsies Lash lift, which is an awesome drug store mascara in my opinion! Just curl your lashes and apply the mascara until you get the desired effect. Hopefully this helps some!!"

rapecounseling,fee4c1g,t3_eokyyz,1579026123.0,"It is going to be hard. But I don’t regret telling my parents at all. They’ve been so supportive and have helped me in so many ways as I try to deal with this. I asked them if we could talk and sat them down and just sort of ripped the bandaid off. “I just feel like I should let you know that I was sexually assaulted a couple weeks ago.” That’s exactly how I started my conversation. You obviously know your parents better than I do, so present it in a way they will respond best to, I guess. But also make sure it’s in a way you feel comfortable with too. They may ask questions and if it’s something you don’t feel comfortable answering, just simply say, “I’m not ready to discuss that part of it yet, but if I ever need to, I will reach out to you guys.” I am so so sorry you’re dealing with this. I think you’re incredibly brave and you’re taking a great next step in telling the people you love. Sending you lots of love."

I hate thinking about what was done to my body when I was passed out. I want them to understand what they’ve done, like REALLY understand. It’s so hard to accept that they never will. 

And I get that for sure. There are a few little things like that with both my assaults that if they didn’t happen, like bleeding or being in pain, then I’d talk myself out of it completely and would never have sought help. I hope you have a good therapist who you trust. And if you don’t and need resources, please reach out to anyone on here!!!"
rapecounseling,fdqmazv,t3_emolib,1578670054.0,"I am so so sorry, honey. Hearing your story reminds me so much of my own. I was drunk, but hadn’t had enough to be black out drunk, however I was (can’t prove i was drugged but I’ve always wondered). A guy took me home from the bar and he was a guy I would’ve NEVER gone home with if I had been sober. I have the smallest flashes of memories. Throwing up in his bathroom, him undressing me and making me shower, being thrown on the bed. I remember saying a few things and being really confused and disoriented. I only remember one tiny moment of being raped by him, and it was only because I was in so much pain as he was doing it. Then he called two of his friends over. He said something about a threesome and i repeated it back to him, as a question. My next memory is of one of his friends putting his clothes back on (no memory of him raping me) and the other was forcing oral sex. It was now the morning so i have more memory. I never said a word, I just did what he said because I was confused and terrified. I thought that maybe I had agreed to everything, I was just too drunk to remember. The last guy to rape me made me bleed and I just got up after like nothing had happened and had them drive me back to my car. It wasn’t until later that day, my memories resurfaced and I went to the hospital. I share my experience because what happened to you was absolutely sexual assault. Just because you never said no, doesn’t mean it wasn’t rape. I am here if you ever need anyone to talk to. I understand how you’re feeling. I tried to talk myself out of it, too. Using every excuse so that I wouldn’t have to accept that I was the victim of a violent crime. But admitting it to myself finally helped me start the healing process. You are strong and brave. You got this. Sending love."

Go to a farmers market when you can for produce. It’s a lot cheaper than the store, at least where I live it is. I shop at Aldi and Save-A-Lot for groceries, but the Dollar Tree has some groceries too and I’ve gotten stuff there multiple times as well. And obviously, don’t buy anything you don’t absolutely need and save any left over money you have each month. For dog food, see if a friend or family member has a Costco or Sam’s Club membership and if they’d be willing to get you some dog food for you. You’ll get a lot of bang for your buck buying in bulk.

rapecounseling,fbdxq9r,t3_ecsctk,1576773687.0,"My story is similar to yours. Almost two years ago I was drugged (i don’t have proof i was, but it is extremely likely i was) and taken from a bar to a guys apartment and he raped me multiple times. I never said no, I never asked him to stop, never tried to fight him off, but I know it was rape because, like you said, I would’ve never done any of that if I was sober. He called two of his friends to come over and I was blacked out for a lot of it, but I know they both raped me as well. One of them made me bleed. And maybe I even said I wanted it at one point, but I don’t remember that and if I had been lucid, I would have NEVER consented to that. We all have a fight, flight, or freeze response to trauma. Seems like your response is to freeze. Mine is the exact same. My exboyfriend raped me also, over the summer. I didn’t think of it as rape at the time cuz I never said no, but I couldn’t because I was completely paralyzed by fear. I also believed he’d never hurt me, because he “loved” me. But he loved controlling me. I say all of this to make the point that rape isn’t always cut and dry, black and white. I’d recommend seeing a therapist to work through those emotions and situations so you can begin to heal. So sorry you are experiencing this."
