It's true that songs create emotion, if you put kickstart my heart on while driving fast or watch one of those jet fighter or racecar compilations it hypes you up for the thrill of living.  Sad songs get you sad, nothing wrong with liking the music, but remember it changes your emotions you are feeling at the time. Believe me I was in a horrible bedridden depression this time last year, I listened to shit like xxx and jojo along with eden etc. I like them she but it's not good for the mental imo, listen to Mr blue sky and it's a beautiful day u2 or something more optimistic, trust. It's the little things you do that can make an impact. Not doing a chore, it piles up and it's a fucking mountain you have to tackle.

I would start the dopamine fast for as long as you can and be honest with yourself on why you want to quit and it better be a decent reason.write your thoughts in a Journal and stop cutting, even that will throw you off and create a bad habit used to bite my nails earlier this year, badly too. I was too afraid to cut but I would feel the pain the burn from how my fingers felt and it worked for me. Now I got long nails, I'm happy for the small moments, I'm achieving stuff at work and school.let me tell you I have had fasts for longer than 2 weeks straight of just salt water. You can do a 5 day. The whole thing is it resets your dopamine usage so when you have sex it's really rewarding, it's way more applicable for men because we organs and lose our minds every time but when you do it soo much it becomes meh, but when you do nonutnovember its freezing and beyond that. More confidence testosterone and less loss of nutrients, more protein means stringy and if you do it a ton of will be water based almost. It's a real physical impact to your body chemistry that will effect procreation."
MadeOfStyrofoam,f779k2a,t3_dun6g9,1573447936.0,"Look if you want to challenge yourself maybe challenge this, it may not work for everyone but over time it may help to rewire yourself to have proper dopamine hits. It's like if you take a break from smoking and then you smoke again, it hits way harder, if you smoke weed all the time it takes more bowls to feel good that way less would do so it shows that when you do not do this chemical reaction all the time, you will be rewarded better when you do. Now this concept with parts of your life that is potentially creating a white noise of constant dopamine hits, what helped me is a dopamine fast. Hear me out, when I was depressed, feeling numb and in the void and nothing did it for me i did a dopamine fast, it will remove sources of negative/addictive dopamine and set you back up to feeling that dopamine hit on good things but not all the time, this is a great time to quit bad habits. Think about it, eating good/bad food, masturbating/sex a ton of social media gram sc texting, any notifications of the sort that get you excited to look at your phone etc all will constantly put in dopamine hits, really think about how many times you do this daily or even weekly. Here is a video that goes over it, believe me, this past new years is when I was planning my D-Day and this helped me get back on track from feeling numb to feeling alive and in the moment. Try it for a week legitimately, what have you got to lose if you do try it, call me an idiot and tell me it didn't work, atleast you tried it.

Do not think of anything else but answering that question your therapist has. eg for me I would say i was suicidal and my uncle died to suicide by train and I need help processing these feelings, the feelings of wanting to still end it and more now towards wanting to live. Could ask stuff like how did you feel before, how did you feel when you found out, how do you feel now, can you describe how you are feeling when you say you want to live and still want to die. It is really hard to just talk upfront about it without having some dialogue, oh hey doc I want to die but I dont because my uncle committed no life. Yeah other than some past childhood issues/traumas that's basically what's up. Like that is great but when you get questions and answers and you can soul search that's how you can dig deep and heal. No guarantees it will work for you or maybe your therapist is crappy but give it a legit go and dont just forget it or say fuck that I'm  ot listening to an anon. What have you got to lose.
