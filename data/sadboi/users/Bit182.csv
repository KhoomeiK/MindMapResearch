Yes, I agree, but miss out on what? Miss out on life, yes, definitely, but you don't need to miss out on every stupid thing or trend anybody does (bullying, substance abuse, theft, ...). That's called peer pressure and it's generally agreed to be a bad thing.

Exactly what I did when I was younger.

That was until I was around 16 or so. Then I ""forced"" a change of mindset and completely isolated myself. Now I totally regret that.
