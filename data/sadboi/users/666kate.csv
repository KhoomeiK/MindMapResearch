And my budget is around £1000, this is going a bit over. Plus I have to buy windows and a monitor. So In all I'm guessing around 1.2 MAX.

I will update the monitor later on so I can get better frames or it'll be capped at 60 anyway. But I'd rather get a really good base PC before that.

And personally, I don’t think they should even prescribe benzos to people having it constantly.
I know some people who are on below 5 mg a day. And whenever they try to come off it, oh my lord. Its a horrible experience to witness AND experience themselves.
They’re trapped for life basically, unless they do a specialised hospital detox. But benzo withdrawals can last over 6 months if you’ve been on them for a long time.

OP, heed my warnings and u/surrenderme ‘s warnings.
This is not the option you want to take.

EDIT: 5mg sounds like a small amount, but with the affects benzos have on your brain, its a HUGE amount.
Your doctor knows what she’s talking about, listen to her. By going to another doctor, if they give you the benzos, they won’t be helping you, they’re trapping you with pharmaceuticals and will continue to pump you with addictive substances. Don’t fall into it. A doctor who prescribes you benzos off the bat, does NOT have your best interest at heart"

It just becomes this cycle.

I’d definitely tell her the promethazine doesn’t work, I use promethazine for sleep along with other stuff. Its not meant to be a flick of a switch.
But what I would do is try and get an appointment earlier with her, if not, wait and say you need help finding non addictive aids that work the same. Maybe beta blockers or something.
