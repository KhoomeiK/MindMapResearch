I say this for two reasons: One, I think it is always best if we pin down the problem as precisely as we can so that there is less room for misunderstanding as we (hopefully) try to do better. And two, as someone who is pretty badly mentally ill, overly direct and generalized calls like ""stop doing x!"" tend to stay with me for a long, long time and they occupy a lot of space in my head.

ContraPoints,fi3f6c4,t1_fi1zmte,1582115259.0,"I'm sort of glad you're asking because I think writing this out is going to feel very good.

So, I took notes during the video. (That was a first for me for one of her vids.) Notes on my thoughts, my sexual history, and just quotes from the video that I thought were really valuable. Like, two pages of stuff that contain literally some of the most crucial puzzle pieces to my struggles with sex in and out of relationships. The last of these notes was ""I am grateful that I watched this sober, but I'd like to do drugs now.""

So I got out the rest of my weed and my thesis prosecco and just sort of took a break from my brain. Since I always deal terribly with those, I've been having a minor depressive episode over the last two days, but today everything is pretty much back to normal. What really got me was hearing about the need to think about constant submissive behavior. I've sort of known this and it got to a point where I've been frequently thinking about some of my behavior as somewhat related to sexual self harm - but I really, really needed to hear this idea specifically from someone else.

I am newly single and I had been thinking about putting myself on a break from sex because I didn't like the way I have sex with men and I haven't had an amazing time during sex with women either tbh. So right now I feel pretty calm and optimistic, I'm grateful for the things I learned and I know that there's no need to rush to consequences in any way. I'm not looking to date anyone and I can just let all this sit for a while and think about it. I don't think I'm fully asexual but I do think that a *lot* of my sex drive is very, very trauma fuelled and I want to get to the bottom of this (lol). What I did realize (and I had never thought about it before because it made me feel ungrateful towards my partner!) is that I absolutely get to a point where I am constantly submissive when I'm in a long-term monogamous relationship. So, I can be into being more dominant with a man I haven't been seeing for too long, but after a year or two, I end up just being submissive. And if I'm honest, no matter how much I love a person, I just don't feel fulfilled in these relationships and god knows I personally don't care for monogamy. So, my goal for now is to not compromise on this, should I get back into another relationship.

Source: Was a gateway flexetarian, am now mostly vegan with the occasional exception.

Edit because I just can't shut up: It's also a diet model that implies best what we as a global society should be doing - we don't exactly need to go 100% vegan altogether, but we need to drastically reduce our consumption of animal products.

If the portrait simply seems ""feminine"" to the viewer and this is perceived as mockery, then that would be entirely due to misogyny/homophobia of the viewer themselves.

For the Zapata portrait in particular I'd say this isn't a completely clear-cut line. On one hand I'm inclined to think that ""feminine"" erotic poses and nudity should not be perceived as a degrading thing for men - on the other hand, suggestive pose, nudity, and downward glance at the horse with a massive schlong are, to me, all sending the message ""I have sex with this horse.""

Regarding the meme you reference, I think it is a bit thoughtless and overall incorrect: My opinion is that when someone is showing red flags, you shouldn't date them. Period. Regardless of their age or their ability to change. It's okay for all of us to show ""red flags"" in our behavior at some points in our lives but that might mean that we're just not fit to be in a relationship at that moment. We can work on the color of our flags and then date once we are better equipped to be fair and equal partners. At least that's how things should be in an ideal world. In the real world, a) people fall in love and they end up not caring about red flags, and b) mental health care is often terrible or all around inaccessible for many of us and we simply are very lonely and want to be loved.

Again, good luck from me too! You're awesome for doing this!"
IncelExit,f8pmxkf,t3_e1itqj,1574704077.0,"Congrats on planning to go! My personal recommendation would be to view this first and foremost as a challenge for yourself. Try not to look at it in terms of an endeavor that might fail or succeed depending on whether or not someone shows interest in you - consider it a success if you manage to talk to three different people. Socialising while awkward and nerdy can be painful, and by doing it anyway, you're getting valuable practice.

My more practical advice would be to start with whatever technique feels comfortable and then listen to people's clues: How do they react when you behave this way? If they seem to distance themselves and not enjoy things, try a different approach. What you want to find is a compromise between a you that feels most natural to you, and a you that other people find pleasant.

And lastly, being less abstract: What you want to do while speed-dating is gather information about the other person (their hobbies, interests, personality) by listening to the content of what they're saying as well as the way they're saying it. So you might want to start with a general question such as ""What do you like to do for fun?"", and then pick part of their answer to go in further: ""I've never done xyz, how did you get into that? Was it hard at the beginning? What do you like about it?"" If the other person is any good at conversation, they will be doing the same. Don't respond to their questions with one-liners, but also try not to be too long-winded. Two or three sentences are usually a good idea. If you do get over-excited and talk for two minutes about that thing you love, it's always great to apologize for it - that lets the other person know that you care about their time and role in the conversation. Generally, getting into nerd-rants can be a super likeable thing as long as they're not incredibly negative.

Good luck! If you find this helpful and have any more questions, just let me know!"

She did have to adjust to the comparatively light version of BPD that I have: Social workers come in contact with the worst of the worst cases of people who are really terribly mentally ill. I understand that this can be traumatizing and that it can be easy to lose perspective on how mental illness can show up in different forms and degrees of severity.

But none of that excuses the way this lady treats you!! I'm so sorry. I hope your boyfriend stands up for you - otherwise I would \*seriously\* reconsider this relationship, this sort of abuse coming from her is not healthy for someone who already has a lot of struggles to face."

 I get what you're saying in terms of the advice you imagined, but that's very hard to do without people asking specific questions. Also, I cannot provide help with hiding big noses on account of them being cute af. But I get that people's tastes differ on that one. My husband keeps complaining about his as well."
IncelExit,f89e3xg,t3_dzmb3p,1574371529.0,"I like the idea of this thread - but I agree that both sharing face pics and promoting body positivity might not be the right thing for many members at this moment. And to be honest, when I have bad days with my mental illness, it often also doesn't help me to hear ""Well, *everyone's* beautiful."" Here's what has helped me:

\- Cook your own food for the day. It makes you feel organized, healthy and mature. All of these traits are attractive, if you want to see it that way, but seeing yourself as that type of person will also improve your mood.

\- Wash your face and put on some moisturizer! Super quick fix, will make you feel great. (If it doesn't feel good, try finding a moisturizer for your skin type - there's lots of info on this online.)

\- On that note, take a shower, put on nice clothes (whatever that means for you) and go out - doesn't matter where, you could just go for a walk. But go out and be aware of your surroundings, what you see, what you hear, what you smell. If all three of those are bad, go find a place that's at least somewhat nice and make a note to yourself about what you like about it.

\- Buy a shirt or a pair of pants. Or anything else that you can wear. Go shop around - if you think you look like crap in your usual style, do try something else. You shouldn't go absolutely crazy taste-wise, just find something nice that fits. Our brain chemistry loves that shit.

\- Buy a hygiene product - shampoo, lotion, conditioner, whatever you want. Make extra sure that you like the smell of it. This one is more accessible because it can be very cheap.

\- I know OP lists the gym as a long term project, but it can literally do so much for you the first time you go. Try signing up for a class of anything (for me it was a martial art, which I personally think is great for self-loathing: When I hated myself, I didn't mind as much getting beaten up and it helped me stick to it and now I'm actually pretty alright). The first time you go can make you feel amazing already. Just promise yourself that if the coach and the community there suck and don't treat you well, you'll go find another place. Because that is the opposite of what you need.

\- If you feel real shitty and your country puts you on a several months waitlist for therapy, look for free counceling by non-profits in your city. I both joined a group and saw a therapist who does her volunteer hours there, and it was a quick way of finding some stability and hope.

\- Donate to a good cause. Sometimes, my only good event of the day is giving 2 bucks to a homeless shelter. It's not much, but without me, they'd have 2 bucks less. That's an alright accomplishment for a day.

\- Petting zoos. Trust me."

AmItheAsshole,f84ubgc,t1_f84imp8,1574260893.0,"I... literally gave examples of better phrases one could use to respond to this situation. The important thing about my suggestions is that they're not implying that the small talk initiator should be ashamed for trying to be friendly. Knowing that you did nothing wrong would really help if someone has a negative reaction to your question like that.

But I absolutely agree with you, I would also not like to be talked down to like in OP's example. I can see myself responding like OP though if you catch me in a really weak moment and make me feel bad enough. If I had said that I would apologize though."
AmItheAsshole,f84fm5s,t1_f84cilt,1574246013.0,"Because it is incredibly rude to shoot someone down like that for trying to be friendly and to connect with you. It's okay to not do small talk, but since small talk is a normal thing to do, a good response would be ""I'm sorry, I really don't like/am not good at/don't want to do small talk.""  


If you don't do that you basically are guaranteed to make the other person feel guilty about trying to be nice to you - and that will affect \*everyone\*, but even more so people with other mental health difficulties (social anxiety would be an obvious example here, but I personally have borderline and being appropriately office-friendly takes a lot out of me - someone reacting like ""Sam"" in the post would absolutely mess me up for a good part of the day). I'm super supportive of giving people on the spectrum the environment that you guys need to thrive, but it can't come at the expense of others like that."
