Your bank will be able to see that this is a subscription service and that you authorised the payment by inputting your bank details. 

Submitting a fraud claim will most likely needlessly create red flags for you from your banks perspective, as they’ll know you’re most likely trying to duck a payment. It’s not good.

In future I’d recommend a second account away from the eyes of your parents, or cancel immediately after signing up. Most of these sites just let the trial run it’s course instead of restricting access.

Over what? What could make you loose your temper so badly that you then feel compelled to pick up your pet and beat it to the point (or simply hard enough) that you break a bone? 

If the animal provoked him, what could it possibly have done that was so bad it warranted that response? If it didn’t provoke hime then, what the fuck?

It’s tough being in a situation like this when it’s someone you love, but this is very worrying behaviour (especially that joke he made, that’s a disturbingly and worryingly cruel thing to say).

relationship_advice,fo9slco,t1_fo9pm2v,1587629693.0,"I think we’re probably both mischaracterising what op means/intends here and applying our own bias to it at this point (like you mentioned). But with that said, from what I’ve read or understood OP saying, it’s not that she’s simply not shaved in a few weeks or forgot. It’s more likely that’s she’s stopped completely with intent not to start again over a longer period of time. I think.

It’s not that it’s in any way unnatural or “weird”, anyone with a braincell knows body hair is plentiful and natural for humans, it’d be technically weird biologically to have no body hair so no-ones arguing that I don’t think. I’m assuming it comes down to attractiveness for op, which I can understand because it’s a preference many people have and they’re no less valid for having unless they are then belittling or unreasonable to people/partners who choose otherwise. 

I think people seriously misjudge the impact a lack of sexual attractiveness can cause. Otherwise strong relationships can crumble due to lack of sexual attractiveness and thus potentially the desire not to be intimate. 

I also think it’s kinda facetious to dismiss stuff like that as simply the relationship most likely not being strong. We don’t know how strong it is and have nothing to go off of. 

She’s well within her right to do whatever she pleases, but I think we should appreciate that forgetting or not bothering with the intent of doing it later/down the line and deciding to totally stop is a change and are two different things. If at the start of the relationship that formed part of ops attractiveness to them and still holds as a basis of attentiveness to them then it makes sense. 

Regarding op struggling to find a partner that shaves after a 3 year relationship, I’m not so sure about that. It’s probably drastically different in different places/culture etc."
relationship_advice,fo9oct3,t1_fo9nquj,1587625618.0,"Maybe to you, I’m not gonna judge. But the bottom line is that physical attractiveness is extremely important to most people and that can manifest itself in different ways. You can call it stupid or unwarranted etc. But I understand where OP is coming from. 

Rather than simply chastising op for daring to have a preference, I think we should at least try and offer a solution that might actually help them both and their relationship first. 

That being communication, expression of the problem and why it’s an issue. 

If ops gf utterly refuses to compromise in any way (which she is well within her rights to do) and op can’t see past it then yeah they should break up. You’d be trying to revive a dead horse at that point imo"

You might even be able to come to an interesting compromise.

A lot of people here are going to do the knee jerk “just break up then you can’t force them, they aren’t your property etc” comments, but that isn’t especially helpful when you love someone. I feel It’s a bit lame killing an entire relationship simply because you can’t have (at the very least) a conversation.

I start with getting the milk rolling (angle is important for this), and once it’s going then I lower the milk jug against the steam wand to start adding air. Once I’ve got what I’m going for, raise the jug so you’re no longer adding air and rather just heating the milk up to your desired temperature.

I will say the roll is pretty important though, as that mixes the milk through itself so you avoid getting bubbles etc and end up with a smooth (or close to smooth) finish."

Social distancing/self isolating is the best hope we’ve got of flattening the curve, saving lives and easing the burden on our medical professionals/system, that means only going out if it’s absolutely necessary and avoiding others. 

That means only going out for groceries, essential travel for work or to see family in need etc. 

Band practice isn’t essential in any way shape or form no matter how important it is to you, I understand where you’re coming from completely but it’s simply too risky. What if one of your members or you happened to catch it on the way there or is incubating it unknowingly with no symptoms?

It’s what’s made me hesitant to outright quit my band in the past because I don’t want to end up in a situation where I can’t find anyone for years (my exact situation before I found this band). *sigh* gotta keep looking I guess."

bandmembers,f6kj43j,t3_dmun58,1572913176.0,"Finding a drummer is really tough, my bands old drummer left and we couldn't find one for 7 months. It almost split us apart.   


Luckily one of my coworkers was a drummer and recently left his band, I nabbed him while the iron was hot and all worked out and that's who we're with now.   


The best thing I can think of is going to local gigs and scouting for who's got good talent. Try networking with them and getting them on facebook etc. It might not be an immediate fix, but it should give you a pool of people down the line and occasionally some people in bands will be down to jam anyways.   


It requires perhaps being a little uncomfortable and approaching people, but if you want it badly enough you'll do it and it's fine once you get into the swing of things."

offmychest,f6f7m00,t3_dr5pwq,1572811386.0,"God that’s terrible, I’m so sorry to hear this has happened. 

In this scenario I would get away for a few days and figure out your perspective and plan, it’s still new so emotions will be running high. 

I’d then confront him again about it asking for an explanation and see what you can do from there, if he denies it again despite mentioning there’s proof and you explaining that you know he’s lying I’d straight up walk. It’s one thing to have this happen, but it’s another thing to be gaslighted into feeling like you’re going crazy. I imagine he’s running scared and trying anything to cover his tracks and work his way out of this situation since he knows he’s been caught. But that’s no way to deal with a situation this serious, especially with your partner."
Guitar,f5zw8et,t3_dpsjb4,1572591324.0,"There are different tiers that offer different quality. 

The mega cheap ones for like £80-£100 often aren’t that special and are as you’d expect, very beginner guitars. 

Moving up the price ladder though, the classic vibe series guitars are really quite good and great value for money. The Japanese squires are also heavily sought after, there’s also a series of squires called “Silver Series” from years passed that have a little bit of hype around them for being phenomenal guitars. 

It’s like any other guitar brand though, there will be good ones and bad ones. The only way to see if it’s right for you is to try one out in person.

A good setup can make all the difference in the world."
Guitar,f5zvyzk,t3_dpnfgl,1572590888.0,"I use a fender hot rod deluxe (40 watts) for a clean tone I can then run pedals through at gigs. Average size, 1x12 combo. 

40 watts is honestly way too much at smaller venues if I was using the amp solely for the tone and trying to get it to distort etc, I can barely get the volume on the amp past 3 without the sound engineer starting to get agitated. Because I only use it clean I don’t need to be very loud and all my pedals do the work, the engineer just mics it up and away we go. 

Buying a big loud amp sounds great in theory, but if you’re playing small shows most likely the only thing it’s going to end up being is a pain in the ass down the line and a liability. They’re cumbersome, a pain to move and if you’re relying on the amp solely for the gain etc you’re mostly likely going to be left wanting as you’ll never really be able to turn it up much if ever. 

Most people who I know who steamed ahead and bought big amps for local shows ended up selling them 4-5 months later as they’re just a pain and too much to deal with. 

Some amps are better at lower volumes than others so you’ll need to shop around, I’d always recommend going for something in the 10-25 watt space. But ultimately it’s whatever suits you best."

Guitar,f5852pv,t1_f584q31,1572048851.0,"Amplitube is one I never could get to sound good so I feel you there. LePou/GuitarRig can be good but what you really need are some good impulse responses that will take your tone out of that tin can sound and to something more akin to a real amp. 

I would highly recommend checking out neural Dsp’s amp sims, their site allows you to download all of their plugins for 14 day trials. They’re more geared towards the heavier end of things but it could be worth a shot before pulling the trigger on anything?"

Guitar,f583lyu,t3_dmx31m,1572048063.0,"For home recording, I’d honestly just go with an amp sim. 

When you are recording a real amp at home you’re going to run into a load of issues assuming you're doing it in a bedroom etc. 

You’ll need to be able to have the amp loud enough for the gain etc to not sound weird which is often too loud for home use as you’ll need to record multiple takes and have the amp loud for a while, you’ll need a good microphone and know how to mic properly, you’ll be working against the reflections in your room, the sound you record is the only sound you have unless you’re taking DI’s etc. 

Going direct and using a proper amp sim will negate all of that. I’d recommend the Neural DSP stuff for the more heavy end of things, mercurial make some fantastic stuff too."

WeAreTheMusicMakers,f31ddig,t3_cmjwzt,1570572895.0,"I struggle massively with this also, to the point sometimes where I can't even jot an idea down because I'm so critical. Sometimes if I can't write an amazing song/idea immediatelly I get so frustrated and discouraged it can ruin my mood for that day. It's a stupid level of perfectionism, it's completely counterproductive and hinders progress 99% of the time.   


I think it stems from the fact that I spent most of my time ""learning"" my first instrument, I learned licks, riffs, songs, etc. and focused on getting my playing up to a good level.   


I spent basically no time writing full songs properly though, I wrote riffs etc. yeah but never really a full song with a focus on arrangement/dynamics/melody etc. So now as I'm older and songwriting is what I've set my focus on I'm struggling. Just like I struggled to learn my first chords, songs, etc.   


To me, it's like a muscle I haven't truly developed. And needs to be developed from now.   


Not sure if that helps, but I genuinely think in most cases songwriting is something we need to develop like we did when learning our instrument etc. I think we assume if we get good at an instrument the songs will naturally follow, and that's not often the case."
