westworld,fp11u3m,t3_ga5r37,1588222153.0,"I'm skeptical about theory #4 and #5:

There were 5 pearls (6 if you include OG Dolores/Halores). And I argue that all 5 pearls have **not** been accounted for:

1) Hale - Dolores Copy (As OP mentioned - it's not the OG Dolores/Halores we saw escape)  
2) Bernard -  OG Berarnold   
3) Connels - Dolores Copy  
4) Musashi - Dolores Copy  
5) Unknown - N/A   
\--------------------------------------  
6) Dolores - OG Dolores/Halores (the one that escaped Delos using Hale's body)  


For #4 (and possibly #5) to be true, The Unknown Pearl is OG Dolores, and the Dolores we've seen throughout S3 is another mere copy of OG Dolores? But why would she do that?"

I was emotionally abusive to my ex, who decided we needed to break up early last year. Upon doing so, I started going for therapy and kept working on my personal growth. In the middle of the year, we spoke again (on the phone) and I updated her about my progress; quite similar to what your ex is doing at the moment. My ex made it clear that she was extremely proud of my journey, however, everytime we spoke her old-wound opens up (quite similar to how you described it; crying, etc), and so it was best for us to continue no-contact.

Ever since then I have continued working on myself and am at a far better place than I was middle of last year. This wouldn't have been possible if she had let me in again because I know there was a high chance of me hindering my own (potential) growth or worst reverting back to my old ways. 

""When we can no longer change our situation, we are forced to change ourselves.""

That's exactly what has happened to me and my ex respectively. Looking back, I'm grateful for the space she placed between us. I'm proud of how far I've come, as I'm certain she's proud of hers. And this wouldn't have been possible if she had let me in again.

I hope upon reading this, you'll be able to decide what's best for both you and your ex in the long run.

My only tips would be:

\- Get a local data sim at the airport. Google maps/translate was a crutch throughout my 2-week trip; I hardly ever had to ask strangers for help (although when I did, they were very helpful!)

\- If you have not invested in a rail pass, I suggest you do! It will save you loads of money when traveling to and within those cities.

\- Keep a power bank/charger with you at all times

\- Exchange cash currency. Most, if not all, stores don't accept credit card- Depart early (I tried to take the 5am/6am train) if you're heading to tourist hotspot areas i.e. bamboo forest  


\- Don't tip, don't talk loudly on trains, don't eat on the go esp on trains (it's considered rude)

My therapist said that it might be linked to our lack of self identity - when someone else tries out our interests / does better than us at it, it feels like they're ripping away that part of us, so we lash out at them / we judge ourselves.

She recommended focusing on myself and my own growth in said activity, instead of them. 

It has been hard but I realise what helps me now; is to (only) share my interests with someone else when I'm more confident with my own skills in it. 

That way regardless of whether they try it/how well they perform in it, I have more power and confidence to force myself to focus on my own journey and progress instead of theirs.

You **DO** trust them and you **DO** want the relationship to go right, but sometimes your BPD lens comes on and you still the world distortedly. When this happens you need their help to assure you that they aren't mad at you etc.

What you're doing now to cope is, in fact, something we learn in therapy; we're always advised to ask for clarification from the other party instead of coming up with assumptions of our own. So you're doing great! :) Your partner needs to trust you on this, and trust that their cooperation will benefit the relationship tenfolds.

As for the space bit, I think giving them some space outside of the relationship would do you both some good. Try to find some fun, validation, memories on your own or with other friends. Some breathing space would work wonders for both you and your partner!"

BPD,f1b47jq,t3_d8gcgx,1569322996.0,"Currently going through the same situation; 3-year same-sex relationship that ended early this year. I was a mess when it took place; was stalking her social media accounts every day. It was so crazy that I even contemplated taking my own life. But now, fast forward 4 months later, I'm at a much better and healthier place.

My advice to you is to focus on yourself. As cliche as it sounds, it truly does wonders! Learn up as much as you can about the disorder and work on regulating your emotions through DBT, meditation, exercise, etc. And in the meantime, please block your ex from social media. Every time you stalk her, you're reopening your wound over and over; preventing yourself from dealing and healing with the emotions. Don't worry about her needing to reach out to you, she will find a way if she wants to, trust me. 

If you don't have enough self-control from refraining yourself from unblocking her, use apps/extensions that would help block her pages. But you must, **at all cost,** prevent yourself from stalking. Stalking is an impulsive technique we use to deal with strong emotions; it brings forth short-term benefits with severe long-effect. 

Practice the wise-mind technique in DBT. Your emotion-mind is telling you that you miss her and you long for her, whereas your reason-mind is telling you to move on and work on yourself. Combine the two and you have your wise-mind; it's ok to miss her, but you still have to shift the focus of healing on yourself now.

Good luck!"

ExNoContact,f0xre3v,t3_d76c04,1569043246.0,"I was just like your ex a year ago. 

My ex politely set boundaries; told me she needed a break for the time being and I didn't take her seriously then; I was absentmindedly sending her memes/articles of things we bonded over, every other month. It didn't seem like a big deal to me then because a part of me was in complete denial of the breakup. However, by not respecting her boundaries, I consequencially paid the cost for it. From us taking a break, it evolved to complete NC. It took this painful ultimatum from her end, for me to pause and realise that this is really happening, and the reality of being cut off completely popped my bubble of denial once and for all. I have, ever since, respected her decision and have gone full NC. 

Long story short, I'm advising you to be more stern about your boundaries with your ex. He is either, like me, in denial to cope with the pain or he doesn't respect your decision. Both of which, are wrong. So either way, you need to let him know that what he's doing is not cool, and if he still doesn't comply, you have to block him; yes it would be painful for both you and him, but it's easier for you to heal and deal with your own issues this way. 

Short term benefits will get the two of you nowhere, focus on the bigger picture and do what you need to get yourself (and him; even if he doesn't realise it yet) to a better place. 

Looking back, I know my ex did the right thing, I (despite being the dumpee) am at a much better place now, and I'm truly grateful she did what she did; it helped me grow in ways I wouldn't have without it.

It depends on what your end goal is from sending this. If you wish for a possibility of getting back together, then you can send it (although accept the fact that you may give yourself and him, false hope and this will affect your healing progress)

If you're intending on sending it because you feel bad/obliged, then you shouldn't. Yes, he may be hurt, but really you're doing BOTH of you a favor. 

My ex did not wish me on my birthday this year (we broke up a month before that). And honestly, I felt a little down back then, but now in hindsight, I believe that she did the right thing.
