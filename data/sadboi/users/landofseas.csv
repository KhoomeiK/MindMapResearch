A little backstory, he's recently been separated from the military, and the care that was provided to him probably wasn't the most structured. I think know he has more options in how he wants his therapy plan to go. I know he has a lot of things that he will need to work on and I've believed it for years."
ADHD,f0w64ra,t1_f0vxary,1568999867.0,"I agree. This typically happens when his feelings are pent up. I don't see him cry a lot, but it can be explosive when it does. I personally don't trust him to be by himself during these episodes, but I know he has been in certain situations in the past where he was alone. It just so happens I was in the room with him and we were winding down for bed. 

I know he's dealt with these feelings and the coping mechanisms he's used throughout his life, even though they aren't the most healthiest of ways. We're working on getting him a good counselor/psychologist he can work with to create a sustainable plan for him the future. I also suggested to him that it'd probably be smart to talk with his psychiatrist and reevaluated his medication situation. He has a lot of emotional trauma on top of his comorbid disorders, so he has a lot to unwind and process in order to move forward on better well being."
