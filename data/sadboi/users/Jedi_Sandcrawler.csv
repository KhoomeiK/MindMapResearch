And when reading a scientific paper, too often people treat it like any piece of journalism or other popular literature and downplay the findings and hypothesis because there is a big difference in the style of writing. Finding over 100 gene variants that have a role in 8 major mental health disorders from a study that size is a pretty huge step in understanding the genetic component of those disorders, including bipolar."
