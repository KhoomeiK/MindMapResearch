We're a small indie team, and this is our main project for the moment. Full 3d dungeon crawler hack and slash roguelike. It's been fun watching my pal program this up in a matter of days. Was really rewarding to take the artist's concept references and make the 3d models and animations. and to see them implemented into an engine we can interact with is a great joy.  


I've been a developer of games since I was 13 (31 now) and I have learned Qbasic, Ruby and GML. Not really learing gdscript, but sort of watch my programmer work. I've developed games earlier in life than 13 on cardboard using assorted game pieces from other games.

It's a blast to have the skills refined into something more tangible as an adult. I've recently invested in sound equipment, a midi keyboard with output to pc, a sampling mic, sound pro and finale 26. Yes I'm classically trained and can compose.

I've wanted to make a game like this for a very long time.

As for our game, you'll be playing as a Mandrake, which is yet another long term dream of mine. Ever since my Uncle Brokenfeather taught me about how Ginseng turns into the shape of a human at 100 years of growth, I've fantasized about a hero Mandrake that went on adventures and took on epic challenges for the sake of life."

oh check it. found the eve intro video in word format  


  

Over a thousand years ago, a professor of the institute of Technology of Massachusetts by the name of John Wayner discovered a text on Mount McKinley that has widely been called a complete mistake of humanity. However, as the professor discovered, the text was not man-made. His hypothesis was that it had come from a distant planet, somewhere from the vicinity of Andromeda, mostly because the text said so. It was translated by a linguistics professor in Bloomington Indiana, at Indiana University.

No awards were given out, as the text was believed to be pointless. But the translating professor had this to say: “If you read the texts, you will be disheartened. Not one of them truly has a happy ending. All 200 fairy tales include some form of death. My hypothesis was that the fairy tales were for preparing the inhabitants of the planet Kaporu for immortality, and to instill in their young certain principles and beliefs they would not otherwise learn from everyday life; that is to say, the common sense found in the texts are not common to everyday life.”

To which most said was a completely ridiculous concept, because no one had ever heard of Kaporu on Earth. Regardless, it became one of the most popular alien texts to have ever been discovered, despite the fact people thought the texts were completely stupid. It surpassed the sales of the Oxford Dictionary, Diaries of a Social Recluse and Fifty Ways to Embark on Tea Expeditions.

However, no one became filthy rich from the endeavors, because the publishing company/companies said no one was the original author on Earth. It is believed that the entire text was written by someone, or thing, by the name of I.B.M. to which no one knows what the abbreviation stands for.

Without much delay, enjoy the Two-Hundred Fairy Tales of Kaporu, and if you feel so inclined, read them to your child and see how they react.

And he will go places like Bars and Hells Angels Hangouts and shout, ""TARD"" from rooftops and all over the lands. Blessing those he sees needs his word.

My own life journey lead me west, homeless for 2 years, living on 1.50$ a meal, and sleeping inside a coat under a tree at times. Shelters were a god send, and showers were miracles.
I pissed off a Navajo in my travels, courted a Crow and Blackfoot, and saved a woman from homelessness and a crippling meth addiction. I stayed off drugs on this journey, had one beer with a local in Montana, and for the most part, felt miserable.

DnD,fghb6ul,t3_eyi3tj,1580780921.0,"so we are making a game, we spend days on it's own system inspired from tabletops like 2e. The character there is the elder in our opening sequence, a dwarven elder who is about to write his will for his adult dwarven children. The squirrel and butterfly are meant as easter eggs, that teach taming, and alchemy/harvesting. the Slime is to show off the battle system, and in the battle he is gravely wounded and passes that night in his sleep. The other easter egg not yet in this mood board, is a goblin, that is the owner of said slime.  
The dwarves in our system are a proud militant people that lost their kingdom to demon summoning goblins and orcs.  
At the end of the intro, you select which of his children you incarnate into, and that is your class, and starting gear. The game starts with the player rolling for stats, and those are added to your starting build.  
It's been almost 20 days of production, and we are making efforts a bit each day. I'm the lead and programmer, but also artist when needed (i made most these except for the sprite of the dwarf, the template was our lead artist). I'm a bit of a workaholic and I get demanded to break often.  
We have a very slimmed down system compared to traditional D&D systems. For one we have 3 stats that double in function. Abilities such as feats and skills and spells can be learned by any class, but only specialized classes gain proper bonuses and use of such abilities.  
Most D&D system stylized games through a character sheet at you and make you invest in a big load out. In our system, the game play builds your character, and the environment and interactions shape your character.

I also fell out of college right as I was learning all I ever wanted to. the important thing is to keep pushing forward and keep some kind of positivity. the mind likes to look for negative affirmations when the chemistry is askew. but there is always meaning, and we are always loved."

I have started illustrating an illuminated manuscript, and the subjects I create, the renders i put on parchment, are shown to me later in the waking.  


I called the crisis line once, and it was because of a disabled soldier guy that kept harassing me.

It sucks that the world looks at everything and everyone as something to thief from.

if I could I would hug you and share my art with you.

I also have SZ and some form of Depression Bipolar.

most the time I fail, and the darkness of sorrow pains linger. sometimes, I'm bright and full of joy.

i have something that's just for soldiers.

 “I am holy  
 “I am divine  
 “I am undone by my evil  
 “I am perfected in my love  
 “I am changing  
 “I am created  
 “I know peace  
 “And I suffer war  
 “From dust was I made  
 “To ash shall I be incarnated 

anyways, nothing I do brings me economic success so I live on SSI. I hope you are well and that someone brings you a tear of love"
