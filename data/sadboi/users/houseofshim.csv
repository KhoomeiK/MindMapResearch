TalkTherapy,fqfb4i6,t3_gij4di,1589321780.0,"If you tried speaking with her and she's not willing to discuss the issues, much less compromise, I'd move on. Therapy should be a structured, two way relationship that mimics supportive, healthy relationships, in order to show us how to advocate for and accept ourselves and others. The process should guide you to discover personal insights and to explore them, as it sounds like you are doing. It's not about having someone else mapping out your path and pushing you where they think you need to go. It's your path. 

It sounds to me like her demeanor is putting you in a position of feeling not good enough, at least that's how I would feel. I stuck with a psychiatrist for many years who made me feel I wasn't good enough; my concerns weren't as important as those she chose for me. I tried at least four times to discuss my issues with her, to no avail. It was damaging for sure. I can't imagine if I'd seen her weekly, or regularly, instead of bi monthly. It's so nice to look forward to sessions with a new psychiatrist and therapist and I've never worried that she'll convey to me that I've failed in some way. If that changes, and we can't discuss it, I'll happily move on again. It really and truly should be all about you, your moment to find your shine!"

I thought I'd stay in and rest, nip it in the bud. All morning I thought poorly of myself for that decision. I beat myself up for being lazy, for not doing anything productive, for being useless, for not going to work. I tried to convince myself it's ok to stay home and rest but I ended up bathing both of my rambunctious dogs. Now it hurts a bit more, I didn't get much rest, but hey, at least this proves I'm not useless. In other words, yes, I'm REALLY bad at being sick."

raisedbynarcissists,fc46u7o,t3_efzywu,1577408195.0,"At my house it was beverages. Depending on dad's mood, you could be watching tv and go to the bathroom and hear the tirade begin. It could be a newly poured soda with lots off ice, on a fresh napkin, it didn't matter. He'd throw the glass in the kitchen sink and start yelling, ""who the hell left this glass...."" Then if you dared say it's mine and I just poured it, look out, you were now against him and trying to make him look crazy. 

Once at a bbq at our house, a guest ran inside for something and left a Solo cup on the kitchen counter. The man came in the kitchen when all hell was breaking loose and started apologizing that he'd left his cup there for a few minutes. My dad didn't care that this man was a great friend, his peer, he just tore into him that we don't live like that etc. Everyone was mortified, including the guests, but dad kept it up by going around like a crazy, throwing beverages away. Later he claimed to have a migraine, our cue to go into poor, sickly dad mode. I was always amazed that an unattended beverage could ruin any event."

therapy,f8r05aq,t1_f8ou4vv,1574728612.0,"At first I did injections and they were very helpful. It's much cheaper than infusion at around $250 each in my area. My last one was over a year ago, but I think at first I had 3 injections within 1.5 to 2 weeks. After that, once every 3-8 weeks, depending on how my mood was holding up. Same with infusions, it depends on how you feel. You know when you need to go.

For the first 3 I went to work and left late in the afternoon. After each type I had to wait around the doctor's office for about 45 minutes. You do need a ride home and that can be difficult to arrange, but I took Uber many times. After the injection you're not nauseous and slightly off like with infusions though, so I felt perfectly normal just without a cluttered mind.

I convinced my sister to find somewhere in her area and she too has done great. She's still getting infusions every 2 months or so, but I have a heart condition and had to stop for now. I may try the nasal spray though. It really was a amazing treatment."
therapy,f8otyuz,t3_e1b99l,1574690138.0,"Ketamine injections and infusions worked well for me in that situation, down to the brushing teeth part. Everyday tasks had become such a burden. I could barely get out of bed for work and didn't bother to try on the weekends. It helped me to dissociate from the immediate, obsessive, harmful thoughts. I was gradually able to put the significant pieces together so that I was able to work with a therapist. It wasn't overnight but it was small random accomplishments that I would notice. Eventually those accomplishments added up to reasonable functioning. I did treatments for over a year and don't know where I'd be today without."

I thought the other side would be college, and then marriage, and then divorce, and then moving away, and then marriage. But I stayed on that side throughout, even after Mom died.

raisedbynarcissists,f8emqs3,t3_e0g38a,1574530615.0,"I've always been an acknowledge it, let it go, and move forward kind of person, but for the past few years - ok, about 9 years - I've been stuck in depressed mode. This past summer I started seeing a therapist and now I'm realizing, that for me, how I react to the present is still stuck in the past. It's like anger and frustration is where I stop, no matter what. Even in happy, festive situations I can't fully let go because I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I monitor everything going on in the room in case I need to prepare for negativity afterwards. My mom, siblings and I could have great fun together, but somewhere during the party or holiday, the manipulation would start with my Ndad picking apart one expression, or laugh, or whisper. It would always end with him in a rage and silent treatment for one of us. 

In therapy I spend little time rehashing my past, but just getting some of the events out there and connecting the dots to the present has been cathartic. There have been so many people deserving to be in my life, but I almost always pushed them away. My Ndad died last December and it's been a relief not to wake up asking what next. It feels good working to recognize my true current emotions and to try and build on the relationships I have now."
