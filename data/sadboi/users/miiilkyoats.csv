Anxiety,fqcd44m,t3_ghq6zj,1589255318.0,My therapist told me about practicing acceptance. Basically when you're stuck in a spiral of thoughts (especially of things that are out of your control or unchangeable) just tell yourself it's just the way things are. You can't help what is. The idea is to give the thoughts an end point breaking the spiral of thoughts and freeing your mind up to function better. Hopefully this makes sense.
