bipolar,fpebrky,t3_gcyqmh,1588544365.0,"It’s super weird, before I found the best medication combo, no matter what state I was in I always had some urge to just not exist. Even if it was just a small urge, or severe depression. It was always there, almost like a familiar constant at that point.
What if I bought a gun.
What if I overdosed. 
What if I was attacked and I told them to do it after they threatened to kill me.
What if I ran my car into a brick wall. 
What if I died in mysleep.
Do I have the guts to cut my wrists.
Inhaling carbon monoxide doesn’t seem THAT bad.

I wanted it to end, but sometimes I just wanted to suffer. I imagined it, dreamt it, and hoped for it.

Then my psych put me on Quetiapine, and it all seemed to click in my head, no symptoms, sweet relief from depression, and intrusive thoughts. 
Just a clear head.
While it’s a relief I also feel kind of empty sometimes, looking back it’s almost like I miss the familiar feeling because it was just that, familiar. If I try I remember the thoughts but the actual feeling is gone and so those “images” don’t come anymore.

It’s strange."

BipolarReddit,fo2t9f7,t3_g5au01,1587473518.0,"I get it. I’ve noticed it a lot in my journal entries; I write just about everyday. My journal entries went from chaotic entries about life, love, pain, and the such. Now my head is almost blank if that makes sense. I don’t get the pretty swirls of emotion I’ve had for over 27 years if that makes sense.

Yet, I prefer it this way if I’m honest. Sure the idea of that euphoria is something I miss but I’m still very aware of crying into my pillow because I can’t get rid of my overwhelming feelings. I remember the thoughts that ran through my head of paranoia, awkwardness, anger, and jealousy. I had feelings like I couldn’t be in my own skin. Most IMPORTANTLY, I also remember what it’s like to hurt so bad I want to buy a gun to make it all end. With the good euphorias there’s also a bad euphoria. 
I love this balance, of being stagnant. For the first time in my life my head is empty of everything except for what I want it to be. I’m not constantly having to try to push things out of the way just so I can function. Instead I can be present and I have room to be creative. I can have a conversation with a girl and not worry about being better than her. I can actually focus.

Yeah... now everyone at work knows. No one has treated me different though, and it feels freeing.

I’ve been making a point to tell people after they have had a chance to see how I work and such so when I bring up mental health I have already broken stigmas. It’s important to make it okay.

During the holidays I deliberately brought it up and just made general comments nothing that would be “bible thumping” or forced just mentioning things like it’s okay to not be okay.
