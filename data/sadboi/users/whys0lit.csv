Just waiting for the lockdown to be done...but I worry that if I coparent with him, he will still have a say in my life.... He is a very hurtful person who has repeatedly used our daughter to control my life and emotions.... I am getting a divorce to purely get away from him for good... I don't want to deprive my daughter of a father but I definitely don't want him involved in my life in any way.."
