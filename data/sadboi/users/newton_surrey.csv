""In the case of Re: Mangat, 2013 LSBC 20, we see a similar application for admission by a lawyer from Ontario with many similarities to our case at hand. The applicant had a rough neighbourhood upbringing, veered into gang life in Vancouver in his teens and embarked on a life of crime until age 23. While the crimes involved armed robbery, weapons offences, gang affiliation, theft and drug possession, with a one year period of incarceration, these offences were not as egregious as our Applicant’s crimes. Nonetheless, the facts on Mr. Mangat’s path of rehabilitation, education and contributions to society from 1997 to 2013 were compelling, as were the many reference letters tendered and so the panel found him to be of good character and repute and fit to become a barrister and a solicitor of the Supreme Court."""

LawCanada,fh73kk5,t3_f1kwpi,1581313896.0,"IANAL, but I am a law student. Most provinces require you to be of ""good character"" to be admitted. Generally, one arrest for an act of civil disobedience probably won't prevent you from being a lawyer. If charged, you will have to declare this on your application. From there, the law society may call you and inquire, or have a hearing if it's more serious. There are convicted cocaine traffickers who are lawyers in canada. Many people have had charges for much more serious things in the past and been admitted.

From my understanding, they care about crimes if dishonesty the most, like theft, fraud, perjury etc.

Lots of resources on the net. If you are arrested but not charged you wouldn't have to disclose this. This is a good cause, thanks for your support. I am also at the BC leg as a legal observer."
