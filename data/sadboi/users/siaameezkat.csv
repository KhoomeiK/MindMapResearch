I used to see a guy who basically told me within the first week or so of meeting, that he’d like me more if I dyed my hair “normal” colors (I love dying my hair dark plum, which is only noticeably purple in bright lights) or if I had a “normal” work schedule (I had three jobs in home health). He used the same excuse of “people who really care stop doing things others don’t like.  I wanted to slap him, because no, people should not have to stop doing something they enjoy just to show they care. I mean, if what someone is doing hurts someone, then yes, they should change if they cared. Other than that, it is absolutely, 100% the person who has the issue’s responsibility “change if they cared.”  

I am so incredibly happy and proud of you for leaving him.  I know it’s going to be hard processing the emotions that will come up from the break, and that’s okay.  You just gave up two years with of effort in a relationship, and it’s okay to mourn that loss.  In the end, I can assure you (from experience) you will be much happier because of it. As I’ve learned, sometimes you have to go through and learn what you don’t want to figure out what you do.  You have another internet stranger rooting for you and sending good vibes your way!"

My friend and her mom both worked as registrars at a local hospital.

Once she realized her daughter actually was admitted, she reported the violation to her supervisor. My friend didn’t care that her mom did that, but the hospital still fired her.

She has a super quiet one that she wears and now she doesn’t snore.

relationship_advice,fcjikc3,t3_ehhuxo,1577688960.0,"I (27F) have pretty similar issues as your co-worker. I used to do similar things as a sort of “test” to see if the guy was actually interested in me or just interested in me for sex.  Most times when I said I thought we were going too fast, the guy would say we could slow down, and then almost immediately try to speed things up again. There was only one guy who said we could slow down and finally meant it; we’ve now been dating for almost a year. So the short answer to your question: for the most part, yes.  

You said you’ve already told her that you respect her feelings and you still want to stay friends. That’s great! I would say give it some time before having a conversation with her.  Ask her to please let you finish what you have to say before reacting, then tell her that you still respect her feeling and will continue to do so, AND if she is ever interested, you would still like to date her at her pace/on her terms; she just needs to tell you.  Then reassure her you are not trying to pressure her in any way and that you are absolutely fine with just staying friends. Tell her you just wanted to let her know your feelings, and now you’re going to leave it at that.  Then, actually leave it at that and don’t bring it up ever again.  

When you talk to her, make sure you emphasize the ‘AND’ and DO NOT use ‘but’ instead. The word ‘but’ invalidates/negates everything that comes before it, so using and emphasizing ‘AND’ will let her know that you really mean both statements.  The final reassurance will revalidate her feelings and your respect for them.  And when I say don’t bring the topic up ever again, I really mean it. Do not ever mention the conversation after that unless she brings it up first. Otherwise, it will come across as pushing and it will show her that you didn’t mean what you said, which will not help her trust issues.

I may upset some people with this advice, and, if you truly care about her, let her do her thing no matter what.  As much as it will suck, it may mean watching her repeatedly date other guys.  If she does date other guys and then tells you the ways you’re better than them, as hard as it will be, don’t remind her that she could be with you, because it comes off as whiny and pushy.  I know this sounds terrible, and from my very personal experience, sometimes people need to go through an awful relationship (or two or three) to learn what qualities they don’t want in a partner, which will then lead them to what they do want.  As the sayings go, “if it’s meant to be, it will happen,” and “everything happens for a reason.”  You can only control so much, so make sure you know when to just accept and let it go."

I have a few people in my social networks that are all about positivity and only putting out positivity into the universe, because ""what you put into the universe is what comes back to you,"" and they have publicly stated that they don't want other people's negativity in their lives.  I understand that choosing to see the positive side of things can make life better/easier and to some extent, I do believe that you attract what you put out and that you become more like the people you spend the most time with.  At the same time, this thinking is uncaring, invalidating and selfish.  Everyone experiences some sort of negative struggles at some point in their life, so telling people to ""keep negativity away"" is like saying ""I only want you in my life when you are doing well, and if you're not doing well, suffer alone because I don't want to hear about it.""

relationship_advice,f83jpoz,t1_f83eyco,1574213559.0,"They are adult disorders and typically aren’t diagnosed until then, though the symptoms can show up earlier. I did comment on the original comment that borderline is highly unlikely, though that’s based on my experience with the disorder.  Borderline typically presents similarly to bipolar disorder, and rubbing a poisonous caterpillar on a sleeping baby “just because” or doing something along those lines is nowhere near a symptom of either of those disorders.  Your nephew seems to show lack of emotion which is polar opposite of borderline where you can intensely feel every emotion in 10 seconds.  

I do agree, though, that professional help is needed for both your nephew and his parents. A therapist for his parents might be able to offer resources to them on how to help manage the situation or give them leads to other professionals for their son. And if your brother goes to another professional for his son, I would definitely suggest having them (the parents) have a session with the new professional before bringing their son in.

relationship_advice,f83ith5,t1_f83ebt4,1574212989.0,"I strongly agree with finding someone who specializes in antisocial disorder.  This is definitely not normal 10 year old boy behavior.  I vehemently disagree with the borderline personality disorder, though. This kid seems to be hurting or manipulating others for fun or just because he can with little to no emotion.  People with BPD are typically over-emotional and there is usually a cause for the intense emotion, even if it is seemingly stupid or small.  Intentionally rubbing a poisonous caterpillar on a sleeping baby is a highly unlikely reaction for someone with BPD, and even if it happened, there would be an emotional reaction when confronted about it, not complete indifference.   Plus, BPD typically stems from some sort of childhood trauma (since the kid’s 10 it is unlikely though still possible), and the symptoms of BPD tend to mimic ADD/ADHD or Bipolar disorder, not psychopathy. 

I still definitely agree that professional help is needed, and it might be best for the parents to talk to the specialist first, without the kid present."

askwomenadvice,f1vh7wz,t1_f1umhwo,1569770850.0,"I also struggle with recognizing my self worth and am constantly going between the two extremes you described. A big reason for that is throughout my life I’ve had multiple relationships, romantic and platonic, where I would get upset over something like a broken agreement and then be told I was overreacting or I had no reason to be upset, so I started to doubt my reactions to everything.  If your boyfriend ever tries to make you feel guilty for being upset about his lying or tries to blame it on you, that is called gaslighting, it is abuse, and it will only get worse.  Questioning your reaction to a situation once can be understandable; questioning your similar reaction to a lot of similar situations is a red flag and you need to take a step back to reevaluate.  

You deserve to be with someone who values you and your feelings at all times, not just when it’s convenient for them."
askwomenadvice,f1sctl2,t3_dapbez,1569727159.0,"From my experience, if he has been lying to you for five years and you know you don’t trust him, I’m sorry to say that won’t change. 

I am all for working on relationships to resolve issues, however both parties have to be committed to the relationship. By lying to you immediately after telling you he knows how important it is to you that he stop lying, he has shown he is not committed nor does he care. 

I can understand the fear of rejoining the dating pool after a long relationship with your best friend. I dated my best friend on and off for over 5 years. He told me he wanted to marry me, and I believed him even though he made no effort to show he wanted to spend time with me. I always had to go to him, even though we lived less than 5 minutes apart. Yet he had no trouble driving the girlfriend right after me to and from work across town (15+ min each way) every night.  He even drove her to the next state over and back (over 16 hours round trip) to help her move her friend to our town. That’s when I realized he didn’t actually love me, just the idea of me. 

Now, I am with a guy that goes out of his way to make sure I am happy and he is constantly asking me how he can help me. I have some mental health issues that cause me to become very irritable, impulsive, and distant. He knows this and during an episode does what he can to make it through the few days.  Then when I’m back to my usual self, he sits and talks with me about how he handled the situation and asks what he can do differently to help me in the future. He listens to my response and then does what I suggest. Our relationship is the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in. 

I know this is cliché, and you need to figure out what you want from life.  Like, sit down and envision what you want your life to look like in 5 years, 10 years, 20 years... Then determine what you want in a partner. Use your current relationship as a starting point.  Decide what you want to keep in a relationship and what don’t want.  Then identify what qualities and values are important to you.  If you really want to try one last time to make things work, make a list of dealbreakers, present them to your boyfriend, and tell him these are your expectations and that if he breaks them you are done.  

You deserve to have your wants and needs heard and met. And if your current boyfriend isn’t willing to do that, then you need to re-evaluate your relationship. You have to do what’s best for you. I hope this help and feel free to DM me if you want to talk"
relationship_advice,f1oppck,t3_daclpx,1569656350.0,"I [26F] have always been overly open in relationships, so I tell my boyfriend [25M] anytime someone hits on me for a few reasons.  

First, my boyfriend constantly compliments me and tells me how luck he is to be dating me, and he’s really the only guy I’ve dated who’s done that. So part of me sharing it with him is because I get excited that someone else acknowledges me as desirable, which then reaffirms to me that he’s not crazy for liking me so much (I have a lot of self-value issues).  

Second, and probably the biggest reason, is because I want to reassure him that I am committed to him.  I know he has had some insecurities in the past but for the most part he couldn’t care less about me talking to or hanging out with other guys because he trusts me. I want to continue to prove to him that he is right to give me that trust.  

Third, we have learned it is a very small world (example: around the time my bf & I met 4 years ago, I was going on dates with a guy that, 4 months ago, I found out was his friend’s brother).  If anything that could even remotely be interpreted as unfaithful behavior happened, I would much rather my boyfriend know about it because I told him.  

Everyone is different though, so no one can really tell you why your girlfriend tells you about guys hitting on her.  If it is something that bugs you, or you want to know her real reasons, I say just ask her.  This could be a really good conversation to strengthen your relationship.  Though if you decide to ask her, I suggest waiting until you both are alone and providing a lot of verbal validation as she explains her reasoning. 

I hope this helps!"

LifeProTips,f1olstz,t1_f1oku49,1569650783.0,Most libraries let you take the games home to play them.  My local library doesn't even have a place to play video games in the library.
LifeProTips,f1olm7f,t1_f1oj8h9,1569650533.0,"Do you know if your library has any partnerships with other libraries in the area?  Most of the libraries near me have an interlibrary loan system, so if my local library district doesn't have something, I can either go to one of the other library districts and borrow it with my local card or I can reserve it online and they will deliver it to my library.  I'm not sure if it still works this way, but I used to be able to use my library card to borrow things from a library 2.5 hours away."
confession,f1oks8d,t1_f1oi72w,1569649528.0,"You are correct that my response was pretty defensive because I have found that there is a major stigma toward BPD, especially on Reddit.  As someone who is actively working to develop healthy ways of coping with BPD, I find the negativity surrounding the disorder to be extremely discouraging. 

I agree that you didn't say OP's mom must have BPD, nor did you say everyone with BPD is abusive. I interpreted the suggestion to check out RBB as you implying you thought OP's mom had BPD.  If this was not your intention, I apologize for the misunderstanding.   I know most of the people on the RBB sub have experienced abusive people with BPD, so I didn't want OP to go on that sub, see all the posts, and come to the conclusion that all people with BPD are abusive.  If OP is able to connect with others and learn healthier coping skills, then it absolutely does not matter where they make those connections.  My main goal in commenting was to provide alternate views to help break the stigma associated with BPD."
confession,f1odcg3,t1_f1o1xsr,1569641598.0,"I agree that finding support in those with similar experiences is therapeutic.  However, I would caution going to r/raisedbyborderlines for two reasons. First, that sub has a lot of post that bash on people with BPD.  Second, to me, OP’s mom’s behavior doesn’t quite seem like BPD behavior; it almost seems narcissistic. A lot of people get the two diagnoses confused.  In my experience, people with BPD exhibit symptoms that are more similar bipolar disorder.

This is not meant to invalidate the terrible experiences you and OP went through.  Abusive childhoods are awful.  You both are strong people for doing what you had to to survive, and I commend you for that.  There are definitely people with BPD who are abusive, and there are also people with BPD who are very kind and working to better themselves."

wholesomememes,f16708s,t1_f1647wr,1569204103.0,"You are so welcome. I really admire you for making the extremely hard first steps of breaking a habit that, I am making the huge assumption, was a coping mechanism for you, on the premise that your child asked you to. You are teaching your child a lesson not only on how to lead a healthy life, but on healthy interpersonal relationships.  

Sometimes in life you have to make personal sacrifices for those you love, and how you handle those sacrifices has a huge impact on your loved ones.  In my case, my mom quit before I was born and remained smoke-free afterwards because she didn’t want to cause me, and later my brother, any health issues.  Because of extenuating circumstances, though, the way she tells people why she quit makes it seem like she resents me for making her quit.

In your case, your child is old enough to comprehend the impact of smoking and the importance of you quitting.  By honoring your child’s request, you have shown them that you care about them and that you value their thoughts and feelings.  I hope that as time goes on, you are able to see your life improve as a result of quitting smoking, and you can recognize and appreciate you child for helping encourage you to quit."

She quit cold turkey 27.5 years ago and hasn’t smoked since. She’s said nicotine was by far the hardest drug she’s ever quit, and she still has urges when she’s super stressed.  Every so often her high school students will catch her inadvertently “smoking” her pen.  I tell you this because while you have a long road ahead of you, it is a road you can travel, especially with such a great motivator and accountability partner.

wholesomememes,f0taiaf,t1_f0t0wo1,1568918716.0,"You’re the third person I’ve seen say something like this. 

In the USA, a lot of kids don’t start school until they are eligible for kindergarten, usually 5 years old, and daycares are not required to teach kids math. Plus, depending on when the kid’s birthday is, or where they live, it is very plausible that the sister just started school.  For example, my birthday is in October and I live in the state of Idaho, where kindergarten isn’t required, so it would have been entirely possible for me to have started school for the first time 1.5 months before I turned 7! Not to mention, most kids that age don’t have the cognitive ability to have memorized basic math.  

Yes, in an ideal world, 6 year olds should know some math and basic words, and parents should be involved in teaching their kids. Unfortunately, though, we don’t live in an ideal world, and many parents are unable to afford to send their kids to preschool or be more involved in their kid’s life.  As for an “actual math lesson,” research has shown that teaching another person helps solidify knowledge, and many teachers use this technique in their classrooms.

So please stop being so critical, and start appreciating all the good this person is doing for their sister."

I think my bigger issue is that they are requiring everyone park 1/2 mile away and walk through the grass to get in and out of the neighborhood for 3 days for chip sealing. Not only is it extremely inconvenient, for some of the homeowners it’s almost impossible. The neighborhood gives off a very anti-kid/anti-family vibe, so most of the homeowners are senior citizens.  Plus, it’s chip seal, not paving, so there should be no reason we can’t park here at night.

Also, have there been any major changes in your life recently? (Like moving, schedule change, family members going to college/coming to visit, new girlfriend). My (26f) kitty (6m) used to get really upset with me when my work schedule would change, and he completely ignored me for the first two weeks after we moved in with my boyfriend (25m).  If something like this could be upsetting your kitty, pheromone diffusers can help ease the stress and anxiety. 

I hope you figure out what’s going on with your kitty!

(On a random side note related to your kitties weight loss journey, one way to give him some mental stimulation and make him work for his food is to sprinkle his food in an empty ice cube tray. I do this with my older cat (11f) and, while it frustrates her, it forces her to eat slower, so now she eats her 1/4c of kibble over 6 hours (she takes breaks due to the frustration/effort) instead of inhaling the same amount of food in 2 minutes)"

The “I can understand your feelings” validation is great. My favorite, though is when he really doesn’t understand, he will say something like, “While I don’t understand why you are upset, I still love you and it’s is okay that you are having these feelings. I want to understand your thinking, so do you think you can try to explain your reasoning to me?”  If I am able to, he listens and asks clarifying questions so that he is able to understand. If I am not able to explain, he tells me it’s okay that I’m struggling, and that he still loves and supports me and we can try to discuss this again later. 

I adore my boyfriend’s dedication to me and our relationship. Like I said, it’s taken awhile to get here, and we’re doing everything we can to make sure we either stay here or keep developing our relationship."
