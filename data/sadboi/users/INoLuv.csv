I never said that being a real fan involves ""masturbating"" to Lain, I'm talking about the attitude of EVERYONE, that you think that acting this way with me and purely radical with something that isn't even real makes you ""special"" and ""more fans"" ""by Lain (i am adressing everyone and it seems that you followed them, so i am being general) ; the image didn't bother me, but what do you want to imply that ""speaks more of me""? Can't you just calm down and just slow down, instead of making much ado about nothing for free for something as vague on the Internet as a post on Reddit? People are always like that, they could be less aggressive and more genuinely kind, instead of inflating themselves in the joy of social hypocrisy;

Oh, i forgot: Handholding is cute and romantic, true-love is needed nowadays, is not ""degenerate"", before someone says that i am sick because i like handholding (yes, is a meme, but i am saying just in case someone like that appears, which seems to be something that could happen, because love is pretty much just a joking offense to anyone)"

Everyone is boring and tasteless nowadays); People think that being against mere ""rule 34"" style artistic drawing will be proof of how much they ""really"" like Lain;  pretentious posers who are apparently quite satisfied with their sex life and want to preserve a fictional purity, it is as if it were a fetish;  You are not ""representatives"" of Lain or are you special in any way, how could you?  I didn't even care what “Lain did” in this image, I posted for the song: Yes, I knew about the supposed “sexual connotation” that seems to scratch you all with such voluptuousness, but it is an appreciable image and there is nothing to justify her condemnation as if it were objectively ""wrong"", not at least because it is used in a music album and has its own brand;  but whatever, I don't need to justify anything to people like you: Why do you have to be like this?  Is Disappointing.

EDIT: The post was removed, very suggestive; you consider yourselves to be ""true"" Lain fans, so of course, as you attach so much importance to minimal things in life as a post on Reddit, did you feel great enough to somehow manage to make what I posted was withdrawn: I am used to this kind, you have no love, you are not pure, you are not virtuous, none of you, but it doesn’t matter, conformity is dominated by boredom, and hypocrisy plagues everything with its facade moralism ; but what does it matter? There's no need to yearn for change, always gets drivel anyway, so whatever; but Remember: You wil still be in the payroll, being this moral and karma police will not redeem you from whatever your personal anguish or fear may be, one day you may end up getting lost in the middle of the herd and, maybe, if you are lucky, find yourself a good way of coping with the reality with an identity based on virtue signal, so whatever"

The level of piety that female fanbase expressed by BTS members everywhere, they exaggerate in their speech, is extreme, so that's the context of what I said but you don't seem to read my answers right.

Your rambling statement that ""I never heard one of the songs"" and the supposed ""sadness"" in the lyrics: Yes i said that, and i was refering to the personal details they put into their lyrics that can be interpreted as trying to make a sad impression on the song, because songs that appeal to it sell well; that was my answer and did you read it? Perhaps you have read but not understood.

Good for those whose image of ""suffering"" produces an audience for them"": Yes i said that, and why What I said was in reference to what I said earlier about the BTS song that tries to give an impression of personal details linked to sadness issues because it sells, and I said it's good for them to keep wanting to sell that kind of image. because it sells well

I have not attacked their benevolent and sumptuous integrity nor their beloved image, the only main argument in my post is very clear in the title and explanations I gave to every misstatement you made; yes, I can be a ""sad man"" who does not like their music, and neither wanted to mask it in the post, but my main argument was clear and definitely do not intend to offer a critique of their music even though I think very bad, because I repeat: the title of my post is ""the undue commiseration most BTS have fans for members of the group is inappropriate and shouldnt stop"", referring to both extremism and the fanaticism that extrapolates on the living conditions of the members of the BTS, and you seem to choose not to understand that; if someone is entitled to something is a non-objective opinion, then that part of the comment is irrelevant.

In any case, spending so much time defending attacks that were not made on BTS members is impressive (you for example), and it's funny how devoted some people are to choosing to empathize with a select group of people (like them); anyway, unfortunately most of the people who might be kind and friendly end up as rude people at the end of the day, but that's often expected of the boring and hypocritical people of nowadays society, so it's part of the routine having to be disappointed and frustrated with this whole dystopian scenario."

And yes, I practice writing and have written a candid little bit of things such as storytelling and novels, but even with talent and knowledge in my mind of broad topics, I have no appreciation in that regard; but would there be another place where we could talk better?

DontFuckWithCats,fcadcqv,t1_fcacddb,1577567268.0,"That's a compliment, one of my favorite books is Crime and Punishment, thanks; yes, Luka would have been questioned anyway, but the case might not come quickly if he didn't want to; yes, it has a minimum rating iq, so nothing grandiose (not smart or clever); Speaking of dostoievski, do you like the author? My favorite book, however, is Nabokov's Lolita and I have a taste, say, very exquisite and selective about art in general; other question: You are a woman?"
DontFuckWithCats,fcabte8,t1_fcaba6u,1577566354.0,"Well, many of the events only happened because he intended them to actually happen, to materialize: For example, when we have ideas, schemes, and sketches of things we have long longed for, we see logical scenarios in our minds that allow us to structure. a causal chain of how to make them happen, and since Luka was in control, that was entirely possible; For this and for other reasons, I think the cops and the anti-death groups of kittens just want to cry out their heroic virtues and show off at the expense of the case and it was pointless, because it was all a scam; I don't think Luka Magnotta has an above average iq, and having an iq of 136 myself, I don't think under the circumstances he's in he can disclose or ask something to a prison psychiatrist, so in my opinion Luka has a low iq and average at best (which i think is not accurate, because luka is dumb)"
