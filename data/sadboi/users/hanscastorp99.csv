pureo,fo62adc,t3_ewfu9k,1587543832.0,"as someone who struggled with crippling derealization/depersonalization for a year (and can safely call that the worst year of my life), all I can say is what ultimately helped me over the hump was acknowledging that all I had in essence was anxiety and that I was attaching this sense of foreboding anxiety to normal thoughts and sensations, that felt abnormal, crazy, etc. because of their anxious connotations for me. the hardest thing about depersonalisation, existential OCD is how hard it is to communicate the basic substance of your anxiety to others (that you feel you don't exist, that everything you perceive is an illusion constructed by your brain that has no independent existence of it's own, etc.) when it feels so abstract and that you yourself barely understand it. what you must remember is that the sensations and thoughts which are unnerving for you are the exact same sensations everyone else is having, they're just not anxious as you are and not thinking about these sensations obsessively.

To quote Hamlet, ""there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."" ultimately there's nothing wrong with your thoughts and sensations (as you pointed out, it's literally the basis of an ancient philosophy) nor is there anything inherently unpleasant about them. what's wrong and unpleasant is the fear and obsessive anxiety you're loading them with. you'll always have these ""derealised"" sensations (I still do, they're human) and perhaps even occasionally these thoughts, but the difference is, if you ignore them now and focus on other things in life, these will eventually disappear and with them, your anxiety attached to them. it may take weeks. it may take months. but if you focus on your physical and mental health through therapy, exercise, mindfulness, diet, focusing on work/school, perhaps medication, it WILL go away. it did for me. 

&#x200B;

in the past few years, I glided from hypochondria to derealisation to social and romantic anxiety to fears of going insane, and it took all of that unpleasantness and suffering to realise the problem wasn't the manifest content of these anxieties (whether existential, medical, romantic, etc.), it was the UNDERLYING anxiety. when I accepted I have anxiety, rather than I have derealisation, hypochondria, etc. and it didn't matter what it specifically was I was anxious about was when I started to get better and stop attaching so much significance to these anxieties. 

keep it real man and hope you feel better x"

I also realize something like muscle dystrophy would be far more gradual as well. That why I'm wondering what it could be and if MS is a likely cause."

I cancelled a date tonight cause I didn't feel safe walking a ton lol. He gave me a blood test to check for vitamin deficiencies which just came back negative. Obviously, going to schedule another visit but just want to know what this reasonably could be."

If I don't get exactly what I want in terms of women or anything else, I throw an internal tantrum which ironically makes me hate myself even more. If I looked like shit and was basically mother teresa it would be a different story lol."

Nabokov, Tolstoy, and Gorky were far more critical of The Brothers K than I just was and if those aren't voices worth hearing, I don't know who is."

I think I honestly would've been more patient with the ending if I hadn't wanted to throw the book out the window cause of having to plow through the trial.

mentalhealth,f7m474z,t3_dwmnok,1573854285.0,"Dissociation/derealization is the worst! I experienced it for such a long time, it was so scary but am doing much better now. My advice is to focus on tactile or immediate, physical things, like taking a walk, listening to music, exercising, or meditating, and not getting caught up in your own head and trying to analyze the unreal/brain fog feeling. Even something like making a cup of tea and feeling your face can help, seriously, as long as it puts you in the moment and soothes your anxiety. The truth is if you ignore it for long enough and focus on other things it will go away, though maybe not immediately. I'm so sorry about what you went through man, that just sucks <3"
