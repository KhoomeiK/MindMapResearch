I am still unsure there. With Biden/Reade it’s also very early and he only just made his first statement about it today, so as I said I’d like a deep investigation into it before.

Having babies fucks your body, takes 9 months each, not to mention the cost. I could understand asking for one maybe, and even then, that’s a huge ask that is NOT equal to what you’re asking from them and you’d have every right to say no.

On a side note, I am adopted. I can tell you first hand that my ‘adoptive’ parents and I might not be related by blood, but none of us even think about that. They are my real parents, and they have always been. I was adopted when I was an infant, and known I was adopted since day one. My parents used to read me Sesame Street books about adoption and what it meant. I never once questioned that they were my parents (I am 32). I actually even go so far as saying my parents are my ‘soulmates’ because I truly believe I was made for them. 
Side note, also by adopting, you’re saving a life. You know you are providing a good home where you will love the child unconditionally. Without loving families that adopt, children can wind up in abusive situations, spending a life in foster care and group homes never knowing love. 

Hope that helps or brings you some peace with the thought adoption."

Its not like there are commercials or ever were for women to be homeowners or anyone to finish school. I think people absolutely care about men.

One part of this I absolutely agree with 100000% is male mental health. Mental illness has a stigma all around but men get judged WAY more then women for it. Men are taught to hide their emotions and let it build up, they are told therapy makes you weak, and that absolutely leads to the high suicide rate. I think something needs to be done about that completely.

Actually many people with my disorder refuse medication based on the weight gain side effect (they don’t care how much it will help). Believe me, I didn’t wish I had to take it. 
It’s extremely hard for me, who years ago was thin and “hot” to be judged just by the fat on my body. People look at me and see lazy, and lacking control. Hell if I posted a picture on Reddit I would be torn apart and told how fat and ugly I am.  Even though I cannot change it. It’s almost like someone who parks in a disability spot and gets yelled at because their disabilities aren’t visible. 
The way I see the body acceptance movement (even for those who are lazy) is that you don’t have to hate yourself. That you should accept yourself. No one, not even the fat and lazy deserve to be torn apart. They know their fat. Sure they may say the love their bodies but you know if someone said they could become magically thin for free with no side effects they would jump on it. They feel shitty enough when they look in the mirror.

I believe in the movement just because i think everyone deserves to feel beautiful no matter what size no matter their health. They have doctors to instruct them there. I am part of the movement because I am fat for reasons out of my control and I’m trying to learn to love myself through it.

I am adopted too, as is my sister. We both approach it in completely different ways, and both are correct, and valid. While we are both completely our 'adoptive' parents kids in every single way other than through DNA, I personally, wanted to find my biological family just out of curiosity. I also thought my birth mother was very brave (she was a teenager) and I wanted to thank her and let her know I'm okay. My sister on the other hand doesn't even want to acknowledge that she is adopted. Both of our biological mothers wrote us letters that we were to be given when we were 18, along with some  medical records and information on our biological parents (from the time of adoption), she didn't even want that. I was lucky and found my biological parents, my birth mother is a wonderful woman who I have a great relationship with (she feels more like a big sister or an aunt), but my biological father is a different story. He never knew my biological mother was pregnant so he had no idea of my existence but was ecstatic when he found out about me. We have spoke but not met, he has other kids that I talk to and have decent relationships with. They say he was abusive and did drugs. He lives hundreds of miles away is so intense about talking to me and meeting me. He guilts me when I don't answer a text and honestly I don't want a relationship there. I felt guilty at first but I don't anymore.

I think it's extremely natural for him to reach out and want to get to know you but it's also natural that you don't want you. You owe him nothing, and he is not really family. Family is not based on DNA or blood, its based on love. Don't do anything because you feel guilty. Don't do anything you are uncomfortable with."

Your daughter and ex are completely irresponsible and endangering the lives of themselves and others. Neither of them should have a license with that mindset it’s unsafe. I completely agree that you had to do something else to protect her. 
The only reason you slightly slightly suck is because two years is a long time to have her license revoked. I wish there was a 6 month option or even a year Is she still allowed to drive with a permit/with an adult? But I also understand you don’t have many other options and need to keep your daughters safe because that’s what’s most important. 
Maybe make her watch some videos of people who lost family or got paralyzed or severe injury from a texting and driving accident.. or have her talk to one of those people so she can see the severity of the situation and show her why it’s so important.
I think your heart is completely in the right place. I hope as your daughter grows up she realizes that you made the best decision for her safety and thanks you for it.. and doesn’t wind up still thinking like her mother"

It’s unbearable and certainly not “a rough patch” imagine day in and day out being in intense physical and mental pain, being constantly at war with your own self, and unable to control your own mind.
I attempted suicide in August because I have PTSD from multiple rapes. I kept having flashbacks non stop for years and no therapy or snugging was helping. I couldn’t live with it anymore. 
Any major mental illness is an actual illness. You’re not going to say someone who died of cancer is selfish, this is no different."
