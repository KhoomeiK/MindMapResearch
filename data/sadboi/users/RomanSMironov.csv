This isn't difficult. It's just about proper goal setting. Let me explain how I'd do it:

&#x200B;

1. Set goals. Start with small goals that you're sure you can accomplish.
2. Set a deadline for each goal.
3. For each goal, write a short paragraph about why you want to accomplish it. Think about how you'll feel when you accomplish this goal. You'll need to review it daily.
4. For each goal, also write a specific action plan.
5. Use a tracking tool to track your progress for each goal. I use Google Spreadsheets.
6. Start immediately after setting the goals. This is crucial because it'll give you momentum.
7. From then on, plan the time for working on your goals at least one day ahead. This will make sure you actually work on your goals instead of procrastination.
8. When you accomplish those smaller initial goals, set slightly bigger goals. You'll be able to accomplish them now as well because you'll gain momentum at that point.

Let me know what you think.

>For example if someone changes their tone in a conversation or stops using emojis I'll automatically assume that they hate talking to me or that I'm annoying or something to make me hate myself and look at things in a negative unexplainable totally absurd way in addition to going in thought loops about how a burden of a person I must be to others around me.

These key issues made me think about going to a psychiatrist, I did, but the assumption of others (doc's) intentions and thoughts got the better of me and stopped after the first appointment because I always assume that everyone thinks of me like I do about myself.

What did you think the psychiatrist thought about you?

>This turned into a loop of being introverted and isolating myself from others, rarely talking about my emotions, and getting depressed that no one really cares about me.

See, perfectionism is always related to anger or frustration. Perfectionism is the lowest standard you can have because it means no standard at all—perfection can never be met. No standard but just a way to beat yourself up. As a result, you judge yourself and others constantly and get frustrated.

Here's what you can do:

Question how realistic your expectations are. If you didn't draw for 4 years, wouldn't it take you some time to remember how to do it?

Instead of not having a standard at all (which is perfectionism), you could consciously set an expectation that's lower than perfect. And if you exceed that expectation, you'd feel even better.

>My ex has asthma and I do worry but I feel like a fucking idiot because I'm worrying for a person that most likely isn't reciprocating the sentiment.

You're a very kind person, you know that?

I love it.

I wouldn't worry, though.

Perhaps, you could write a quick note about how you wish the virus doesn't affect her.

And then stop worrying.

The act of writing the note will help you release worry.

&#x200B;

>All I really want is to go back a few months when everything was fine. I want to go back to her arms. This virus situation would be so much easier if I could talk to her.

Yes, I know how you feel.

We all felt that after a breakup.

Do you think regretting the past will help you recover?

&#x200B;

>How could so much change in 2 months?

True. I hate it when unexpected things happen.

>Sound a bit silly, but I got tinder - found a couple cool pen pals. Can't actually go out and meet anyone, so I've really enjoyed flirting with other women I actually got a few phone numbers too, maybe something will come of it, maybe not.

Fantastic!

Since you can't meet women in real life, Tinder is great for now. It's good for post-breakup recovery because it will shift your from focusing on the past to the present challenges. For example, how can you make the next date fun.

>Lots of Netflix - movies. 

Perfect.

Again, whatever distracts you from thinking about her is good.

>I joined a gym on Monday, Tuesday they closed those too. Hahaha so I've been on my stationary bike. I might pull out some workout videos and go through those.

I like it. You're doing good with your recovery.

Can you do that more strategically?

Distracting yourself is a good place to start recovering.

Watching uplifting YouTube videos will definitely help.

>so I usually keep it open and watch if people are available and then she might occour to be online and playing.

Is there any way to avoid League altogether for some time?

It'd help to replace it with another game or activity like watching YouTube."

>I’d do anything for her and I did whatever I could to cheer her up, even when her guy she has now hurt her and I stayed on the phone to cheer her up even if it broke mine knowing she didn’t like me anymore... (as she would say) but I felt I had hope.

That's a good lesson not to do this kind of thing in the future. She lost her respect for you as a result. She'll likely see you as a friend only in the future. Boyfriend material doesn't act like this.

>I know life isn’t a game and no one wins or loses but my head has been having a tough time processing this still. I didn’t lose but I still feel I did. I lost a great girl as I see her. But I haven’t fully accepted that she isn’t that great girl anymore. She doesn’t care. And I have to see that. My eyes are blind to it because I wanna see her come back. But I gotta know, my chances are terrible of that.

I don't think you have chances with her based on what you wrote. Move on and I'll help you.

BreakUps,fko7125,t3_fjolvv,1584381354.0,"Hi,

I respect you for being so honest and vulnerable by sharing your story.

> Anyway, there were some goods things about him but below is everything about him that was bad that should've been red flags and deal-breakers to me at either the beginning or during our time together but I decided not to hold it against him or judge him (how I wish I would've now and not wasted my time/energy/etc)!

These things are quite bad, frankly. I would've avoided him altogether.

>Was I wrong for leaving even though his son liked me and had gotten attached to me?

You were absolutely right. I'd do the same.

I think you feel responsible for his son. You are an amazing person. I know it feels hard for you to leave his son. But look at it this way: if you had stayed with him, you would've been unhappy all the time. In this state, you wouldn't have been able to provide much support and give love to the kid.

>Has anyone else been with someone with similar issues/personality traits? If so, did you stick it out or did you feel you deserved better?

You do deserve better. I'm sure you did the right thing.

>Lastly, was I crazy to stay with him for as long as I did?

Yes, the red flags were there all along.

Anyway, that's a good experience for you. It'll make your next relationship better. Now you know that you shouldn't get attached to such men. They might feel exciting to you in the beginning because they do push and pull that hooks you. But in the long run, such a relationship doesn't make any sense.

BreakUps,fko5p7v,t3_fjoq6e,1584380611.0,"Hi,

First of all, I respect you for being so open about this.

>I was hoping to become distant friends maybe later.... it seems the damage of what she’s did to me previously and our breakup has caused all this to happen. We never ended on good terms do to so many questions I got left unanswered, but now she’s gone and as I’ve learned before, a block means never talk to me again...

I feel sorry for you. 

I'd focus on how blocking actually helps you to keep the no contact.

>Today’s been tough. Just want to ask what I did to get blocked.

I know it feels unfair.

The thing is, you never know why the other person is doing this or that. We're so different that trying to get into another's head is pointless. You might assume one thing but she could have a completely different perspective.

That's a blessing, I believe. If we learn not to question other people's actions, we stop overthinking."
BreakUps,fko4ych,t3_fjor0r,1584380197.0,"Hi,

Thank you for your honesty.

>it's been over a month and i don't feel any better. he's with someone else now and i feel like i'm still at square one.

It's normal. Think of your broken heart as a bone that takes 2 months to heal. Just as a bone, your heart will heal. And you can help it.

>i've been with friends, i've scheduled a therapy appointment, i've listened to sad and happy songs, i don't know what else i'm supposed to do. he's still on my mind all the time and this empty feeling in my chest is still here.

That could be the problem, his being on your mind. You'll keep thinking of him unless you stop doing that consciously and gradually.

Can you be around other people more?

Can you distract yourself?"

That's great. It means you'll heal very soon. I wouldn't worry about it.

>I was working 10 hr days at my dream internship in a new city, going out to fun events whenever I got the chance, and hanging out with new amazing friends almost all the time. I was following lots of helpful advice and really saw the positive results stem from it.

Impressive. Few people do so well after a breakup. Keep going.

>The last thing I want to do is reach out again,

Yes, you already know what to do.

>If you have any tips on how to stay strong, I’d greatly appreciate it and wish you all luck too.

I'd recommend talking to other people online. Being around other people after a breakup is very helpful because it gets you out of your head.

Do you think you can talk online more?"

>Im not the best at putting my feelings into words, but I think I'd describe them as confusion and lack of understanding for why she kept it going for so long despite saying she was unhappy.

I think you're doing good with your descriptions! I totally understand how you feel.

>Admittedly those feelings have drifted further away from me (although she still does not want to speak with me) since I've read some more into what happens when people breakup. One article which helped a lot was one describing how the person whom says they want to break up, tend to go through the grieving period before actually breaking up, that made a lot of sense to me and made me feel better about how I feel like im having such a hard time compared to her and also how it feels like she is so dismissive of it all.

That's true. I'd also add that girls often break up only after they have another candidate for a boyfriend. They don't want to be alone.

>Usually in the morning/evening which I can only imagine is because we spent our time there a lot watching shows or just doing things that people usually do in a relationship.

Okay. What do you do in those times to take your mind off her?

>only other time is the times im able to see her spend time with other people. Not because I dont want her to enjoy herself, because I do. But seeing her spend time with others while avoiding me stings quite a bit nonetheless.

That's good that you don't have bad feelings for her.

Is there any chance for you not to see her spend time with others? That'd help a lot.

>Once more thank you for taking your time to answer me and everyone else here, I dont think im alone with the thought that your post and responses helps everyone tremendously.

Absolutely! It's my pleasure to help you.

>edit - I still have a few things I think I should do like make try and workout out a bit to feel good, such as going outside for a walk atleast or a run when I feel down or even when im not simply because it would be good for me to get outside.

This would be fantastic. It'll help you feel much better.

>Absolutely. I couldn't help myself from trying to get closure but it never comes. I had been doing better, had a couple of good screw him and his messed up life days..but yesterday I slid back a little and hurt again. Cried myself to sleep. Re-read those last messages and no, still no answers other than he went NC because his wish was to be left alone so I will respect that forever.

Don't worry. The occasional sliding back is normal. It's like an up-down cycle. But each time you go down, it's not as low as the previous time.

>Don't look for answers that won't come no matter how much it kills you. The only thing you are doing is hurting yourself.

Well said. Write a letter to him instead and don't send it. Or say to a friend everything you want to tell him.

>Deleted, unfriended and blocked baby.

The way to go! I am proud of you.
