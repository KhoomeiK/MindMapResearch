It’ll be alright, one day when you pass away, you will meet her in heaven 
(Not saying that I want you to pass away...)
But I have a similar experience and I am with you.. 
You’re not alone!


.....my brother passed away, now he was a really close relative to me.. he was like my BEST friend but god had to pick him, he was so fricken nice.. I am crying while I am typing cause I suck and can’t control my feelings. Lol I am such a loser..
Anyways I just could not take it.. And I am doing much better now knowing a I am not alone and that my other relatives are with me!

Just as they say..
“Son: Mom why do the nicest and good people die first?”
“Mom: Well when you go to the flower garden witch flowers do you pick?”
“Son: The prettiest ones.”

It’s so nice to see that I am not alone, and I am not the only one suffering from this “feeling” you know, it’s much better when you realize that someone else is suffering the same things as you. It’s what makes me feel better but... I just can’t take it anymore I just wish I could die...
Thanks guys, I feel much better now knowing that I am not alone!..... :("
