collapse,fp4n7t1,t1_fp3n7bb,1588302755.0,"I believe that we can feed 10 billion humans but it is not sustainable. Vast majority of people in the developed world no longer practice vegetable growing or self sufficiency. This means that in order to obtain food requires complex supply chains that are powered by fossil fuels. Now if we are talking about what we have been taught is a ""healthy diet"" of 3 meals a day, two featuring meat, it is in no way sustainable. Animal agriculture is a massive contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Farming in general uses massive amounts of water/resources. While hydroponic and aquaponic farms are possible, in commercial operations they often need lots of energy to power artificial light sources/pumps. In addition to this, production is limited to mostly leafy greens which while good for you, I doubt you can convince entire populations that they need to eat the same meals day in and out.

In addition to this is the issue of peak soil. Soil quality is being degraded due to commercial over-farming practices. I'm not an expert on this but reliance on fertalizers have meant that the natural nutrients of the soil are diminishing as the soil takes years or decades to enrich itself through the decomposition of organic matter. Commercial operations want as much production as possible so the soil is being used over and over without letting the natural processes take place. While I'm not sure exactly how farmers set up their crops, I doubt they are applying naturally decomposed compost over entire rural areas and allowing time for the soil to recover. This means over time the soil becomes worse meaning yield from the crops becomes worse over time prompting use of more fertalizer, which itself is bad for climate change. 

As a whole for us to be ""sustained"" we would require massive changes in diet, reverting back to unprofitable practices of eating once a day or less while being content with having very little meat and eating the same food often. There isn't anything inherently wrong with this but it may lead to macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies (less protein and fat). Plus I think people would lose their minds being told they can't eat whatever they want in 2020.

Edit: Also making the changes necessary would a massive loss in profits for the food industry so yeah, nah not happening."

But when developing countries try to emulate what we've got to improve their standards of living its considered a problem.

Developed countries won't reduce their emissions because developing countries have high emissions. Developing countries won't reduce their emissions because they want the same standard of living developed countries have. Stalemate ensures.

We need to gradually but significantly reduce our own standards of living but good luck convincing half of any voting population to go for that. Edit: And as a planet reduce our population significantly. I know there are too many people in China and India but if they we're producing emissions at the rate of the US, its all over.

From what I have seen first-hand, I subscribe to fat gain due to constant insulin spikes as the cause of my weight gain and others in my family. In addition to this, how the liver processes the carbs into glucose - excess into glycogen - and greater excess into fat storage is documented and by lowering carb intake/fasting, the body uses gluconeogenesis to burn the stored fat into the glucose required.

If I was at a healthy weight, carbs as part of a balanced diet would be fine.
