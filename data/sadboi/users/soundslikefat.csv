From my personal experience, it is literally deep-set fear/trauma that is stopping her. She may feel she is ready but her body will fight against her on that. There is not much that can change that but time. You mentioned her abusive ex and that may be a HUGE factor. Even if she is not showing it affecting her, with abuse she could still feel controlled by every action of the past, it resonates. You tend to feel trapped and as if you are the unimportant character who can’t make their own decisions in their own life. She may be running from you as a way of her ex still controlling her in her head and she is still scared of upsetting them due to the ghastly consequences of that. She may be running from you because of the trust she had with that ex that was just used as a method of keeping her there to endure the pain for as long as possible. It’s hard to tell, but she just needs support. Do not pressure her and get too angry at her about it at all!! You are right to feel wronged or confused but any big fights will probably give her relapses of her previous abusive relationship. She is probably just scared and damaged right now and that is hard to handle. Obviously I am running off mine and other previous experiences and it may be incorrect but I’m saying it’s not a personal attack to you. She most likely is genuinely trying but is too consumed in the trauma. Give it plenty of time. Let her heal. Could take years but if you’re that invested in her then it is probably worth it. I don’t know though, let me know if it was any help or if I’m completely wrong haha!"

When I cut myself, it was like I wasn’t in control of my body during that episode and the urges had taken over me and I ended up doing it with regret and a messy counter after. If that is the same for you (I don’t know if it is) clean the cuts appropriately, wear loose clothing and SAFE PROOF YOURSELF. Throw everything out or lock everything away that may harm you or that you might run to in a situation. Even get a friend to help you if they know about it! After you resist the urges a few times because you have physically stopped yourself, it gets easier to control. I don’t know if you relate to this but I hope it helps in some ways! Just make sure you’re not getting yourself infected and remember that it’s not something to be ashamed of and if you do it again, that’s just natural process. I hope you work through it :)"
