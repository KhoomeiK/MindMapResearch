wallstreetbets,fnnao6j,t3_g2sagp,1587088096.0,You couldn't be more wrong OP. You have to consider the forward PE of the market now given the earnings dump over the next 12 months due to COVID which makes the market PE a staggering 24. On level with the dot com era before it burst. Given the PE the market is literally the most inflated its ever been. Completely irrational.
wallstreetbets,fnji4sa,t1_fnj0fu0,1586999443.0,False. Yang's plan never included cuts to entitlement programs. No one in their right mind would run on that platform.
wallstreetbets,fnji0hn,t1_fniy5kp,1586999370.0,I could see doing it for two months max. It doesn't seem remotely reasonable to do beyond the month of May or early June since 1) unemployment checks already got the BRRRR treatment and 2) the virus seems to have already peaked or is near peaking.
