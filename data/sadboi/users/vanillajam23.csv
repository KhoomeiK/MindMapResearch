SuicideWatch,fqshqqe,t3_gk7spi,1589607605.0,"I've had bipolar disorder for 6 years after a snowboarding accident that gave me a traumatic brain injury. Against my legally written wishes, my wife decided to withhold that card and choose options to save my life. Since then, I feel like I've just been living on borrowed time.

When I first started going through the ups and downs of mania and depression, I looked to my friends who were just as confused as I was. Eventually I started using alcohol to mask the emotional outbursts even though all it did was exacerbate my intense emotions. All this time I never shared my suicidal ideation with anyone. Eventually I went to end my life with a .22 rifle I had. I would have gone through with it if I wasn't afraid the smaller bullet would just leave me disabled. Months later I told my wife and I started getting help. 5 long years of medication changes and terrible swings and side effects, I can't handle this anymore. I leave my house after accidentally getting drunk at a bar (BAC of .23%). Near my house is a bridge over the interstate that I was going to jump from. I didn't because of all the reasons stated already and then got picked up by the police. Got sent to mental hospital where they adjusted my meds. I got on Lamictal which made a total difference! I finally found the med I needed!!

Its been 3 months of good moods and working a lot. I initially thought it was a manic high, but it lasted longer than previously. Tonight I think I crashed and now I've sunk into a depression. I've stopped seeing my therapist because of the covid-19. I tried reading articles about why its not worth dying but in this mood, those reasons aren't really convincing. Here is my thinking:

1. Friends and family will be upset.
This is true, they will be sad and have self blame, but as I have experienced, life keeps going. My friend committed suicide about 9 years ago. It hurt initially and me and my other friends would always talk about it, but then that gradually went away and it wasn't until I began having this ideation that I started thinking of him again (obviously family probably always thinks about it, but im only drawing from my experience).

2. I have an obligation to live for friends and family.
I've always felt like I owe the world. I try to help people out whenever I can and, despite my mental turmoil, I even tried to help my friend through some depression he was facing. After all my efforts, my closest friends abandoned me without telling me why and allowing me to continue reaching out and getting excuses and I would resolve their excuse only to get another one. And then once I drove by their house to drop something off and the excuse was proved false. I finally got the reason after 6 months of this and I was told ""he didn't want to deal with me"".
I've tried talking to friends and my family about what is going on and, because I seem to have my life under control compared to my siblings, my parents just brushed it all aside as an exaggeration.
Because of all of this, I don't feel like my life is worth much to them while I'm living a little broken, so why do I owe it to them to suffer through all of this?

3. Things get better with time.
Yes they do. Its a roller coaster with many ups. But it has just as many downs like im in now. And the inconsistency is causing me to lose relationships, jobs, everything I value in life. So is it really worth giving time for the ups to fix what the downs screw up?

All summed up I am probably going to continue trying to fake a happy mood to try and keep what I hold dear. I don't condone suicide and don't wish it on anyone, but I understand why someone would want that. For me, being aware of how and why I get in those moods is helping me take steps to create things that make suicide less appealing. For instance, I work construction, and if I lose my job ill lose something that won't be replace with another job. So I am investing money into buying the tools I need to become self employed and thus able to work my own schedule.
Bible reader or not there is a lot of truth in the saying that there is more happiness in giving than receiving. Ive made it a point to remember important dates like anniversaries so when they come up and most people don't remember, I can get them a card or something and their happiness gives me a sense of being appreciated and valued to my friends.
Sharing my story with people who are in pain or struggling really helps me. I feel broken, but I would never say my pain is worse than anothers. People matter to me so if what I say can help, ill talk until I'm blue in the face!

These are things I'm finding can be helpful, but for me they are a lifestyle not something I start when I get low. I truly hope this helps someone. I'd love to hear what other arguments people have against common ""fixes"". Also what do you use to challenge these thoughts?

I'm sorry I went on a roller coaster in this post. I started looking for an answer but then I moved to trying to help with my answers."

Unquestionably Iowa is a solid program with recent success and they seem to always pull out a big upset every year. Congrats to your success. But while Iowa fans are having their success now, let husker fans bask in their successful dominance from the 70s and 90s because those memories keep fans coming back and competitive programs alive.

They won whether or not you think they were the better team on the field. They scored more points in 60 min, so for that hour, they were the better team. That's all I can say and prove.

The education we receive throughout our lives about the dangers are able to stop a lot of teens from trying it and I'd say makes it rare for one to pick it up later on in life.
