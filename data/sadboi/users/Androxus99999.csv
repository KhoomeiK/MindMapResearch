Mind you i didn't have acces to internet until i was 18, that's how bad my town was until i moved to Bangalore. People in my place don't care about anything, wanting to learn or try something new was frowned upon by my peers. I failed JEE, judgemental crap happened, i somehow passed entrance exam and got into a top tier shitty college. I used to think college is supposed to be good,it was literally the opposite, dickhead professors,parents don't try to understand you. Heck when i told of my problems to my parents they just told me to"" get over it"" and relayed everything to those same professors, now I'm one of the most hated students of my class, why ,coz i have a free mind with the ability to reason. The field i chose was literally worth trash,as i didn't knew coz i didn't have internet. Luckily Bangalore did. But the toll was taking on me, in the end i ended up going to a psychiatrist. For the first time i heard words of wisdom. Still my problems didn't subside, i failed a grade, my jackass friends passed. Back when i was a kid i used to think a lot about philosophies, but i considered them as useless coz i used to  open up about them to my dad, and he would shun me down. I used to think i was stupid,until one day i saw a scientist Neil degrass Tyson speak about the same stuff,that's when i thought "" I'm not crazy,it's the world that is"", but still I'm stuck in this jackass pathetic life, little context,i hate my degree from the core of my heart. And i couldn't do anything coz my father and family is paying the bills, so I'm now learning machine learning and AI to get a job and drop out of college and join some much better college with people who respect and understand me. Internet was a boon for me,but here's the reality, my father as of now still has somewhat of a control over me and my asshat professors do not leave us to do whatever we want for even a single day,human life and expectation is a joke in india. College opens the eyes of some and permanently closes the eyes of many. Hookup culture in india is pure trash,if you consider Bangalore as lax and free you're totally wrong,it would be a miracle if you hear loud music after 12. Everyone i meet has to always push their draconian agenda on someone else and control them,nobody wants a change, everyone is in a fuckin rat race and pointing fingers at others not realizing that they are degrading everyone else along with it. Hopefully i make it out of this,coz i can't withstand authoritarian bullshit with pseudo science, i don't want the next generation to face the problems like I'm facing and i definitely don't want anyone to be influenced by the of like my family or face pseudo beliefs."

HistoryMemes,fn0yu4y,t1_fn0p8qj,1586551420.0,"Yeah, about the Mongol defeat in india. When Genghis khan the founder temujin first came to india he thought of going through Delhi and assam and attacking the Song dynasty from the south. Khilji not wanting to be on the short end of the stick made alliance with the Khan and informed him about the Himalayas. You see, khilji was preparing all his life to withstand an invasion from khwarezmia(persia). But he couldn't attack,coz he didn't have a proper army to take them down,all he could do was slow them down. He was terrified when he heard that Genghis khan had obliterated this empire all by himself, he though it would be better not to provoke the khan. Still genghis took Pakistan and Afghanistan. His descendents after the mongol empire was broken decided to invade india( I'm telling about the Chagatai khanaate,byfar the most weakest). These guys captured  modern day Pakistan, punjab and kashmir and went on to sack delhi. Apart from popular belief that alaudin khilji stopped the mongol horde due to his brilliant leadership is a lie. His general Zafar khan (or zafar ali)whom he declared a traitor led his army to fight the mongol, he planned a pretty good strategy to defeat the Mongols, as he spent most of his time learning mongol tactics, but Alaudin khilji didn't do anything, he just withstood there with his forces. After seeing this Zafar thought he would die for his country and lead a daring cavalry charge and severely wounded the mongol general. This self sacrifice ironically saved the Alaudin khilji as the mongol were just about to flank khilji and kill his entire army. His sacrifice saved the entire indian subcontinent from the mongol devastation as the mongol general died of his wounds amd the mongols retreated. The Mongols were literally just 100 metres away from Delhi,but were saved by the man who was deemed a traitor and conspirator. Yeah,and khilji being a complete dick tried to twist facts,but that didn't go well,as the descendants of the Mongols later found the Mughal empire in India."

Also there were many issues with katanas breaking in combat with their European counterparts,heck even other katanas. It was only popular during the warring states period i.e 15-16th century, coz there were no secondary weapons apart from the katana.(primary being a spear). And lack of resources.

You could get kindness if you respected the Mongols, but if you were hostile, they were the worst possible peoples you want to fight. 

And yes something i forgot to mention. They were fighting the chinese and the samurai in the east,the turks in the south, the knights in the west and Russians in the north, and winning.  Except for the samurai where a hurricane killed their navy. But the few who managed to get on shore captured the entire tsushima straight and the casltes on that island.

After siege  of khwarezmia, genghis gave subotai and jebe a force of 20k to find the shah who had escaped persia from the Mongols. These 20k men arguably did the greatest raid of human history.  First they went through Afghanistan, Pakistan(somewherenear them), looting and pillaging villages to find the shah,who manage managed to escape to somewhere near turkey. Subotai and jebe along with the 20k men, defeated all the kingdoms of azerbaijan,turkey,armenia for finding this one dude. Meanwhile a large crusader army of 50k landed in Georgia( i mean the templar knights), subotai and jebe who were ""LOW"" on supplies apparently fell on them and defeated the entire crusader army(yes this is for real, and looted all the supplies) and launched raids in modern day iraq. The Georgians than sent messages to Europe, then later another Crusader army landed. Subotai and jebe after hearing this ,ATTACKED this crusader army and won again. They literally halted an entire crusade. Then subotai and jebe with the 20k they started with went looking for the leftover aids of the shah,and persued them into Ukraine and Russia. Where they again defeated an army of 70k(Russians,in the winter) and killed all the rus rulers by torturing them to death by a table. Then they went back to genghis and conquered the Jin dynasty in China. After genghis died his son ogedai sent army of 60k to inspect this new land i.e Ukraine, this army conquered Belarus,Romania(modern day) and went west towards Poland and Hungary under command of Subotai. His army was now reduced to around 45k. Poland and Hungary decided to stop the Mongols and go to war with then and larger number. Here's when subotai performed a miracle.  He split his army and sent one to poland and other in Hungary commanded by himself. Both of these army were under the command of the Teutonic knights. But,the Mongols won, in both Poland and Hungary. In Poland the king's head was paraded in town, and in Hungary the Archbishop of The Christian church was killed, Hungary was decimated. Along with Poland. Subotai then sent word to khan to get him more troops to conquer Germany and France. Had not genghis khan died due to his drinking habit they would have forced their way into the Atlantic. Subotai went back to Mongolia after the Khan died,which stopped the entire assault. According to persian and ottoman records Subotai conquered 32 nations, fought and won 64 high pitched battles, Subotai was the first commander in Human history to coordinate two battles together and win, and yes, Him along with Genghis khan were the founding fathers of the Blitzkrieg. They were using 21st century tactics in the 12th century. They ended up killing almost 5 million people(just subotaiand Jebe), 10 % of the world population, 25 % if you account the black plague"", the greenest conquer lol."

The Georgians than sent messages to Europe, then later another Crusader army landed. Subotai and jebe after hearing this ,ATTACKED this crusader army and won again. They literally halted an entire crusade. Then subotai and jebe with the 20k they started with went looking for the leftover aids of the shah,and persued them into Ukraine and Russia. Where they again defeated an army of 70k(Russians,in the winter) and killed all the rus rulers by torturing them to death by a table. Then they went back to genghis and conquered the Jin dynasty in China. After genghis died his son ogedai sent army of 60k to inspect this new land i.e Ukraine, this army conquered Belarus,Romania(modern day) and went west towards Poland and Hungary under command of Subotai. His army was now reduced to around 45k. Poland and Hungary decided to stop the Mongols and go to war with then and larger number. Here's when subotai performed a miracle.  He split his army and sent one to poland and other in Hungary commanded by himself. Both of these army were under the command of the Teutonic knights. But,the Mongols won, in both Poland and Hungary. In Poland the king's head was paraded in town, and in Hungary the Archbishop of The Christian church was killed, Hungary was decimated. Along with Poland. Subotai then sent word to khan to get him more troops to conquer Germany and France. Had not genghis khan died due to his drinking habit they would have forced their way into the Atlantic. Subotai went back to Mongolia after the Khan died,which stopped the entire assault. According to persian and ottoman records Subotai conquered 32 nations, fought and won 64 high pitched battles, Subotai was the first commander in Human history to coordinate two battles together and win, and yes, Him along with Genghis khan were the founding fathers of the Blitzkrieg. They were using 21st century tactics in the 12th century."
