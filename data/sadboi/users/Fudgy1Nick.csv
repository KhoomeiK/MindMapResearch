It's also the show that's probably most true to the character's world and evocative of the spirit of the original run of comics while still pulling from every other era with hindsight.

&#x200B;

It's not streaming on anything now, was on Sony Crackle but just got removed last week. Maybe something worked out so it's going to Disney Plus in the future? The whole series is available in a Blu-Ray set or several DVD set right now.

&#x200B;

I think The New Animated Series is underrated cause it was a pretty character focused show that had freedom.

&#x200B;

The Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon at best is good for dumb fun action. Its focus is pretty much always on superhero stuff to the point where anyone in Peter's life is a superhero or becomes one which to me really goes against one of the core appeals of what made the character unique in the first place. The final season of that is probably the best and it tries harder than prior seasons to have some weight but like I said, mostly dumb fun.

Marvel's Spider-Man could be good but it's such a slog to sit through most of the time. Part of what holds it back is how cheap the show looks. A big problem of the show for me is once again one of the main conceits of the show like Ultimate but in a different way. They have Peter  going to a super elite genius school where everybody else in the cast is as smart/smarter than Peter so it leads to everybody feeling too similar and everyone else using science to be super and save the day. Then there's the fact that everybody in the main cast once again just becomes superheroes so everybody in Peter's life is a super genius/super hero. The Superior arc in the 2nd season is the best of the show, though."

They also can do animated movies (theatrical or not theatrical, not sure why they haven't tried to do a straight to video animated feature yet). Spidey or Spidey characters can't appear in any Marvel animated projects that are above 45 minutes in length.

I know lots of people have been bugging Disney Plus about adding Spectacular and TNAS since launch, so maybe if they worked something out with Sony they could drop there? I dunno, the option with less work on everybody's parts is probably just all going on Netflix.

&#x200B;

Either way would be good for the shows. Look how the Clone Wars revival has been for Disney Plus, lots of fan goodwill just from doing it and plenty of acclaim from all over (don't know what the actual viewership is). Spectacular would be a good candidate for such a revival because it's the most critically acclaimed Spidey show, one that got people and press excited that normally wouldn't outside of the Spidey fans who will watch anything Spidey and the target demographic. Stuff like Ultimate or the current show do well satisfying the target demo but don't offer much else for anyone else, really."

It just leans far too into comedy and the whole SHIELD angle is still hard for me to accept. Spidey's the quintessential lone wolf chip on his shoulder guy, I just don't like putting him in that sterile government position and basically making him a SHIELD agent. 

The spy parents in the comics was always controversial because it took away from the ordinariness of Peter's upbringing. Hell halfway through the show he drops out of Midtown High altogether to attend superhero school full time. That's just lame to me, Spidey's supporting cast shouldn't be entirely superheroes.

Since Marvel owns rights to make regular 20 minute cartoons and Sony can't they'd have to do longer things/specials/animated movies direct to streaming or DVD. I don't think it's as simple as getting Marvel on board because they have their own interests, their own shows to do with Spider-Man, and they don't care about one they wouldn't own. 

But Sony is developing Spidey shows with Lord/Miller, and Marvel did sign off on Fox doing X-Men shows The Gifted and Legion a few years ago so it isn't out of the question. 

Spidey's just a bigger IP to navigate, but I personally as a fan don't see the issue because Marvel will have their own Spidey show next year (the preschool show they're doing for Disney Jr) and it'd be nice to have somebody else do something for the older fans because Marvel won't really be filling that niche and it's honestly just more advertising for them cause they get all the merch money no matter what."
SpidermanTNASmemes,fizmwyx,t1_fizl1v8,1582867377.0,"Since Sony owns the rights for this and Spectacular, they still are able to make Spidey shows but with episodes 45 minutes or longer (they are developing some with Lord/Miller), or animated movies theatrical or not, so I do think there are options at the end of the day if they deemed revival projects a worthy juncture and could involve a lot of the key people responsible for the old shows, and get the approval of Marvel/Disney to bring old shows back they don't own. 

So basically a lot of steps but I wouldn't say never, nostalgia's a heckuva thing. Marvel/Disney finally is starting to allow 90s X-Men/Spidey cartoon merch to come out. They own those shows, though, and all merchandising money."
SpidermanTNASmemes,fizj0l2,t3_faohst,1582864145.0,"It is criminal considering it's gone 16 years unanswered so far. Happy you enjoyed the show for the first time, though! 

Even at least for the 90s cartoon we have a greater idea of what would have happened if that continued (plus the head guy literally wrote a couple episode length script for fans a few years ago after backing a campaign of his picking up right after that show's ending). 

Unlimited we know what the show's 2nd and final season would have been structured like from half of the episodes being fully written and the other half having outlines.

Spectacular we have gleamed snippets of what the 3rd season would have included. Hobgoblin, another gang war, Scorpion, Carnage, Hydro-Man, probably spider slayers, Man-Wolf possibly involving Kraven and Miles Warren, Spider-Buggy in the 4th season, Morbius. There's a lot of tidbits Greg Weisman has said would have shown up.

Whereas for this show all we know is one of the producers had an idea for a Mysterio script, Shikata would have likely returned, more Kraven, Vulture, some more comic supporting characters, new clothes for the main cast. We've got really no clue what could have happened next beyond that but the potential was so great where it left off. 

I can't imagine what it would have taken to take Peter out of retirement after this and face a city that hates him even more now and push away the people who care about him even more. That's a big thing I liked in this show was how it didn't shy away from how being Spider-Man is a big burden a lot of the time, it didn't sugarcoat it."

I appreciate that it had a bit harder edge than anything else before or after, it's not something we'll likely see again which is a bit of a shame. I don't think it's a perfect show, but it offers a lot of unique ideas with glimpses of total greatness throughout its run (the Lizard episode, anybody?). It was really just starting to find its footing with consistency by the end with a lot of interesting, heavy, storytelling avenues to explore. Seriously, that 2 part finale is a legitimately great Spider-Man story that has its cake with the dream sequence and then eats it with the ramifications in the 2nd part.

&#x200B;

I know some can't get into it because of the animation style, and some of it shows its age to be sure but the style really shines in some places with pretty sweet directing choices in some episodes- anything with Spidey in the city at night is just saturated neon bliss as he moves so effortlessly and faster than we really ever see. Plus the trance/electronic score by DJ John Digweed and Nick Muir is unlike any other Spidey show and helps give it some great atmosphere. I can't think of any other superhero cartoons that sound so uniquely not orchestral.

&#x200B;

I used to dismiss this show because there's a general stigma that it isn't good because it has lots of original villains and didn't have many episodes but it deserves more people giving it a look these days as I think it has better writing than something like Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon which is 90% shallow. I personally miss the days when we see Spidey cartoons try to tackle the human drama and romance, and Spidey having to be a loner out to help a city that doesn't want especially want his help."

Spawn,fewhblv,t3_eqj4ky,1579410581.0,"Sounds like it's missing stuff because the last episode of the first season Billy Kincaid dies, and there's a vampire hunter girl episode in the 3rd season. All of the show is on Amazon Prime last I checked, not sure how the YouTube uploads are"

Spiderman,febt5nv,t3_enyhch,1578962393.0,"I like the theory that it's Harry, and the Harry that came back in OMD/never actually died is some alternate entity, much like how the first arc in Spencer's run also had Peter and Spider-Man literally being split into two beings. I think that lends credence to the idea that Kindred could similarly be a split being from somebody he used to know quite well."
Spiderman,feb6g5o,t1_fe6tawo,1578955820.0,Ok
Spiderman,fd4kkkp,t1_fctucyg,1578168397.0,"Paul Jenkins and Mark Buckingham on Peter Parker: Spider-Man is a very good, underrated run that's mostly low key character stories about Peter that I love. Was happening the same time JMS started writing Amazing and when early Ultimate was happening so it doesn't get brought up enough as it deserves. That was a great period because all the books were on fire and offering new things that weren't gimmicky"
Spiderman,fcw09gd,t1_fcvyhz9,1578014160.0,"The current one on Amazing Spider-Man, this JJJ centric arc was one of the best stories of the current run, I think"
Spiderman,fcb0q6i,t1_fcay24y,1577580393.0,"I think the JMS run drops in quality big time after JRJR leaves on art, because then instantly it's editorial mandate after editorial mandate. I prefer thinking the whole run just ends there, I mean it has a pretty  conclusive ending on the whole totem stuff when JRJR leaves."
Spiderman,fcaxpuf,t3_egwjws,1577578684.0,"Coming Home is maybe my favorite Spidey story ever. I actually started reading all the Spidey books at the time and all of them were on fire at this point in time, it was perfect to hook a young kid like me because you had Ultimate where he was a teenager in a fresh new Marvel U, and Amazing/Peter Parker: Spider-Man where he was an adult being written maybe the most maturely he ever has been. Peter, the way he was written during this era, was an especially good rolemodel.

I think some of John Romita Jr.'s career best art is in this run. Kt's just a great combo of Spidey being in his DNA and it not being his first crack at drawing the book, inks, bold colors, and meshing so well with JMS's scripts. Beyond that, Coming Home in particular feels like JMS was throwing his all into making a splash on Spidey, it still feels fresh and at the same time makes you wonder why those ideas weren't considered before."
