I don’t see what the problem is with getting an ornament that I would other wise have to wait all year for or purchase with silver. It’s like people are okay with mediocre rewards.
destiny2,fipmxc4,t1_fipmvxu,1582612293.0,Ok.
destiny2,fipmq1f,t1_fipmi4t,1582612075.0,Even with bright dust there is still low probability that the ornament I want will be available and the time involved to get the bright dust isn’t worth the cost of the ornament.
destiny2,fipmnv9,t1_fipmi4t,1582612009.0,I’d be okay with just the perk if exotic ornaments weren’t locked behind a paywall.

LowSodiumDestiny,fewhs6n,t1_fewb44y,1579410816.0,All of your responses have been childish including this one. You have to have some semblance of maturity if you’re talking with others. Or else you just seem stubborn and annoying.
destiny2,felbav9,t3_eprtny,1579218160.0,Okay I feel this so hard. I did exactly the same thing.... TWICE.
AmItheAsshole,feioxwu,t1_feim5sf,1579143621.0,Hmm I see your point. I guess I was looking primarily at the parents perspective. I think OP should involve his girlfriend on who to give the $800 to. If they can both agree to repay the parents to thank them for their generosity that’s great. If they decide to keep the money because they need it then that’s great too. Deciding together will allow both of them to feel heard.
AmItheAsshole,feilj29,t1_feikak0,1579141340.0,"The money was only given because of the agreement. The agreement was “we’ll take you on vacation if you reimburse us for the price of the plane ticket.” If the girlfriend made any assumptions outside of that, then that’s on her."

Vaping,fee3nte,t1_fee0hvw,1579025726.0,You could definitely use nic free juice in the suorin however pod systems don’t offer a lot of flavor because they’re meant for nicotine delivery and convenience. If flavor is your goal then shoot for a sub-ohm tank.
Anxiety,fee0hcv,t3_eooi6j,1579023802.0,My girlfriend had nexplanon which is an implanted contraceptive. It screwed up her hormone balances and left her anxious and distant. I convinced her to get it taken out because I could see how negatively it impacted her. Birth control can wreck your chemical balances and cause mood swings or worse. Take care of yourself friend.

Vaping,fedzqal,t1_fedyd1u,1579023304.0,"A lot of pod systems are refillable like the suorin drop or the smok infinix. I have a suorin drop that I’ve had for 8 months and I’ve gone through 4-5 pods and probably 2-3 bottles of nic salt juice. I paid $30 for the device which came with 1 pod and then additional pods are between $4-$10. I spent probably $25 on juice so in about 8 months I only spent $30-$40 which is very cheap in my book. 

Sub-ohm tanks are the big bulky tanks with replaceable coils and big mods to power it. Sub-ohms are good for large clouds, strong flavors, and smoother hits. I’ve got the Horizontech Falcon King tank on the SMOK species mod and I’ve loved it! I find sub-ohm tanks to focus less on nicotine delivery and more on flavors."
