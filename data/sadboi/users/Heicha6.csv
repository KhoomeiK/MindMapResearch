depression,fqsuww4,t1_fqs22kx,1589619723.0,"Kinda, i can't function normally as a social being now and i'm hopeless as fuck. All caused by that bullying, but im telling you, depression made me see the truth."
depression,fqsus38,t1_fqrmm4s,1589619585.0,"I like the last thing you said.
The stereotypical response of ""you're too young to...."" is something i suffer from, because everytime i give my opinion in something when with family and they don't like that opinion, they dont even say you're too young for this or smth, instead they make fun of me and im now their subject. That's why i avoid my family as much as i can. Sadly i don't have a bedroom, all they do about this is make me feel like a spoiled kid and give me examples of people who share a bedroom or smth. So, im forced to stay with them all the time. What i did to avoid facing them is fuck up my sleep schedule, i wake up at 10pm and sleep at  1-2pm. And there won't be a solution to this since i cant get a job when i turn 18 because i look like a 12 year old and i quit school.

I tried and will try again to ask myself again if what i'm feeling is worth dying over instead.
And btw, my current source of happiness is virtual friends, since i cant function as a social being IRL. Video games is the only thing thats keeping me here. Without it, i would've been dead years ago. And i don't like that."
depression,fqr1s0z,t1_fqpoitu,1589575995.0,I got rid of bullying years ago but depression is still here and it only got worse
depression,fqp6003,t3_gk25ki,1589536256.0,"I cried while reading this. Losing life's taste is the reason for someone to killthemselves. The love of your life left you. Life is meaningless now, what you lived for is gone, what got you through everyday is gone. Your source of happiness is gone.
Im only 17yo. My illness destroyed all my lofe and goals, i loved someone for 6 years, confessed at the 5th and hot rejected due to my illness. Ive been severely bullied everyday infront of that person, there's no way she will accept me.
My illness destroyed all my goals, everything i liked, from sports to jobs to everything. It's medicine gave me anxiety too. So now i don't have friends or anything. +family problems...(illness is prolactinoma if you're wondering) 
Yes, there's someone that his house got destroyed due to a natural disaster and he was the only survivor in the family. That person felt it all at the same time, was shocked just like you. And felt heart broken everyday since the disaster happened. He's done, he can still get a job and get married and continue his life, but no, depression doesnt let you do that and it makes you hate life.
I have been bullied for 2 years then got the biggest shock in my life and at the 3rd year i developped depression. I still had hope but in the next 2 years it only got worse, i quit school 3 months ago because i made a suicide, and why study if you're gonna die soon ? Sadly corona ruined the plan, and hopefully ill do it when everything comes back to normal. I hope someone reads this and replies to it."

Im not trying to disencourage you from taking your life, im just saying"

SuicideWatch,fqde357,t1_fqdcncn,1589287587.0,"Ive only had a total of 5 therapy sessions since problems started and they were therapists i tried and i didnt like, i used to be interested in therapy but now i dont like it. Family, im close to my brother and my sister, were good but they aren't convinced that i have any problem, and that makes me insecure and worried that what they say is true, im playing the victim, its not serious, just move on and life is good. Family treats me badly when it comes to discussions, they never like my opinion and mock me. Mom thinks she's the only one with problems and dad is literally not existing. I dont blame him tho, he's innocent and at least he tries with his best to cheer me up without hurting me. Right now im not really looking for how to improve my life and make it better. Sorry."
SuicideWatch,fqdamly,t1_fqdadu0,1589284996.0,Also forgot to mention that prolactinoma's tumour doesnt kill or something. Worst case scenario is blind/unfertile.
SuicideWatch,fqdadu0,t1_fqd9goi,1589284798.0,"The thing is, i dont lose hope now and then, ive always been hopeless, only time i tried to fight was during my first year of depression. I don't see a future to myself, i have prolactinoma, and im extremely unlucky to have it, as its always in women, and most of the time at 30-40s, and most likely the tumour is smaller than 1cm. I was born with it, im a male and its 1.2cm. If it was discovered a little late, it the cause of discovering it would be that i suddenly became blind. It was discovered already too late, i could start functionning and growing up normally last summer when i hit puberty, at 17yo. Im 1.60m tall too, and my max would be 1.62
Im not eligible to live in anyway, things got even worse when i developped anxiety due to the medication for prolactinoma this year. I couldnt make friends, it was so bad and i quit school for the second time and im not going back.
I also forgot to mention that im terrible at explaining. This is the best i could do. Irl i'd be mouth shut."

SuicideWatch,fqd81bv,t1_fqd7b59,1589282812.0,"Nothing really, even if i want to, i wouldn't be able to. My goals are based on my trash life and hopelesseness, for example, i planned to get a job (soon to be 18) and move out and figure out things on my own and maybe improve my life, because now i dont even have my own room, everything is shared, not like my siblings they have everything for themselves, too much to talk about honestly and im tired of venting.
Ps: everyone thinks that im 13, i dont have a social life, idk how to talk to people, my parents raised me weak and i vant survive life."

Speaking if god doesn't exist, those people are born with it, they can't help it. Some pedophiles take medicines to help it, they must experience depression too."
