I only got it the other day as I was using a bar pen to section off part of my room where the rabbit is, but 1 they scale it instantly, 2 it was too low and 3 I'm getting two more babies soon and they could fit through the bars! Very pleased I bought this; they're very cheeky and have found ways to jump over it/to the top (it's 70cm high) but 100% money well spent :) I would definitely recommend it :)"
