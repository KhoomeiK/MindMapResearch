If you're on week one and everything's going great and the honeymoon phase is in full swing, and one day she says, ""Trust me, I'm a huge asshole,"" BELIEVE HER."

bulimia,f581st7,t3_dn18go,1572047137.0,"I have. It started when I was 15, I'm 33 now.

Now, let me be clear about something: experience has taught me that we'll never be fully healed. Staying healthy is a day to day affair. It's easy when things are going great but when stress is high and mixed with stuff that makes you anxious or feel inadequate, you're on thin ice. I first recovered at 18, went on for a long time with maybe one or no incident a year. I developed other issues, had a relapse around 27, and all was good until a couple of years ago, when I had a major episode. Right now I'm going through baaaad stuff, but I'm struggling with tooth and nail not to open that door because I know that once I do, it gets a life of its own.

So, basically, yeah, you do get well. Years-without-an-episode well. It's a thing of permanent vigilance, but it does get dramatically better up to a point where you no longer think of it."

But I've known from very early on that I wanted to be a writer, and through all those years I was polishing my skill zealously. Today, I'm an editor for a digital magazine, I make good money and I play in an okay band.

And sometimes it ain't even about cheating. Sometimes people are abusive or she's loyal but she hates your kids or your parents. Or she fights ugly and call you names.

Get the hell out that relationship."
AskReddit,eyqla81,t1_eyn8wt3,1567346732.0,"This is the very exact reason I broke up with my ex.

She's inexperienced with relationships and we'd be great when we were phisically together, but she'd do really individualistic shit when we were apart. And I mean serious stuff: She one time quit her job and bought plane tickets to live in another country BEFORE telling me anything about it (she took a couple of days to do so.) Maaaajor red flag that I ignored because I was very in love.

We kept on because I decided do go live with her and switch countries too, but bad shit kept happening. She was absurdly jealous and the most judgemental person I have ever known (she got a grudge against me because I lived ""in privilege,"" which is something I told her many times that wasn't my fault, and I was willing to drop it all to be with her.) I stood with her because she was cute and hard working and I thought we could build something nice together, our senses of humor and sex drives were absurdy compatible, and she's a well read person, which I find very sexy.

I mean, when we were on, we were ON, guys.

So, she moved away and I was supposed to follow her (and indeed I was making all the arrangements.) One day, she disappears for a full day. We stopped talking at four in the afternoon and what I mean by that is that I wrote her on whatsapp (including ""I love you"" and ""I miss you  bby"") and she would read but not answer. The next day, concerned, I check on her social media and she's right there, quite alright, saying how she's never been truly happy with anyone and how she's never met anyone who has made her euphorically happy and she just feels detachment and disinterest in her crushes after a short while of being with them. She tried ""the whole relationship thing with just three guys and none made it past three months"" (she's 34, I'm 33.) And she's just talking normally with her friends.

She finally wrote back as if nothing happened, and I said it was a shame I couldn't make her happy. She immediately got defensive, ""Omg, you've been reading my social media again?"" I didn't fight, I didn't even attempt to explain that I felt ignored, neglected, judged, unloved and unhappy. I just said I did feel all the things she said on twitter and she, full of spite, told me to not victimize myself. This was about two months ago, we've never talked again. To this day, I'm sure she thinks we broke up because I'm, and I'll use her words, ""an entitled asshole who thinks one person can mean someone else's entire happinness.""

Mind you, she got into flirting with another guy a week later and dated soon after. It took me a while to get there, but now I'm seeing someone new and I'm very hopeful for the future. I'm finally not-sad, haha.
I'm glad she seems to be doing okay with her new job and new city, and sometimes I still feel the mourning of that relationship in full force. But boy, was she a shit-girlfriend."

SeriousConversation,ewln9yj,t3_cot174,1565530497.0,"Well, I found out yesterday that my ex is dating again. It's particularly hurtful, because it confirms what I always suspected: That she saw us as an expendable thing, that she could ditch me easily.

Breaking up with her is the best thing that could have ever happened, make no mistake. She has real big issues with empathy, she's very judgemental and petty (and considered her pettiness acceptable), the day we broke up I just felt so relieved.

But dammit, I miss her smile. Her eyes. The heart wants what the heart wants, I guess. I'll get over it."
