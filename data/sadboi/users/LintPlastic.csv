Kind of has an earthy smell to it and I'm not sure if it's doing really anything to my face hydration wise but I have noticed the redness in my cheeks have gone down!

AskReddit,fo1rufh,t3_g53q03,1587440034.0,"Her constant negativity. I have anxiety and depression... a long time ago I'd just complain and complain and bitch and whine and no matter how much other people tried to help me I'd always make excuses of why whatever they're suggesting wouldn't work. I was so dreadful to be around and no wonder people didn't want to hang around with. it took awhile for me to realize I was so miserable because of myself. Yes I suffered childhood abuse but it was up to me! the adult! To get help. I'm definitely not perfect and I still have my days where I complain and my depression gets to me. But now I don't want to be surrounded by negativity. I want positivity, yes I don't mind listening to people vent, I do it myself, but when we start talking about solutions or fixes you better not shut me down for everything i say. My goal nowadays is to try to find a solution. No matter how difficult the situation, maybe I'll scream, or maybe I'll cry, but I have to see something positive in the darkness.

Couple years back I had this friend who constantly complained about everything and no matter what I would try to express like maybe I had a bad day or something didn't go right so I'd try to talk about it. She'd always have to one-up me about how her day was so much worse... her situation was so much worse... it was so frustrating because it was every damn time. It got to a point where I was telling her look we need to be positive more. And I was already changing wanting more positivity around me. Well I got to the point where I rarely complained anymore and all she did was talked about how awful her life was and how much she wants to kill herself... constantly threatening to do it.

I have had suicidal thoughts and my depression has gotten really bad sometimes. And I've realized I can't be around that kind of attitude. It brings me down. I can empathize with people who have depression and anxiety because I hundred percent understand. But the moment they shoot down every single suggestion I make then... I can't do it. It starts chipping away at my mental health and harming me. I had to protect what I had healed so far. I tried really really hard to get to her and tell her what I learned. That once I started accepting the fact that I was the only one keeping me in the miserable state that I was in... I finally started getting better. Slowly but surely. She still wouldn't listen! Still constantly talking about killing herself everyday. this was something she had done for years constantly crying wolf for my attention.

I finally told her I couldn't do it anymore. Because her constant negativity was harming my mental health. You can call me selfish but I was protecting myself. I told her that I wish her the best and I gave her tips on how to try to get better. Like first going to therapy and trying to see the good in the darkness. that no matter how difficult life is there is always a solution. Even if it takes a while to get to you can get to that tiny light miles away in the shadows. Just have to keep clawing your way to it. I also told her if she really felt like killing herself to please call someone because she could be happy. I didn't even give her a chance to respond I blocked her on everything.

Things got better once I cut her off. But we had a mutual friend and our mutual friend had actually already cut her off years before that. Because of the same damn reason!! She said that she wouldn't stop complaining and always trying to say her life was much worse than everyone else's. She would constantly threatening to kill herself over and over and that friend got tired of it too. Also because her husband was a creep. I agreed on that too. Her husband would message me randomly about threesomes and just creepy shit. so she cut her out. Me and this mutual friend are still best friends because we have been friends since 2005? We actually start is in penpals who wrote letters to each other!!

we both have anxiety and depression and we both listen to each other when we need to vent. Yet, we both tried to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Always trying to come up with solutions to help each other and ourselves. Because we know that we have a mental issue and that we are our own worst enemy but we can also save ourselves.

Tldr: cut off a friend because her constant negativity. Our mutual friend also cut her off for the same reason. Also her husband was a creep."

TwoXChromosomes,fm4ez87,t1_fm3adft,1585752818.0,Yes! I have seen this. It is pissing my parents off. But I think it is because of Austin and I am happy for that. I want to move to Austin one day. I may find luck with finding a boyfriend if I do haha. But I am hoping this new election will change Texas for the better.
Dachshund,fm4ev4l,t1_fm37iih,1585752753.0,Oh that gives me hope! I just feel so sad for him. I cant wait to see him walk again.
TwoXChromosomes,fm3293l,t1_fm1mj1j,1585711034.0,"I live in Texas and I love it here because it's so beautiful. But they're backwards ass thinking just pisses me off. I honestly feel like I'm going to be alone forever because I feel like I'm so different from everyone here. They're closed-minded ""I have to control women"" ways just really grind my gears. I'm worried for a woman over here so badly."
Dachshund,fm31h2j,t1_fm2roci,1585710478.0,It does I feel so sad for him. He just looks so lost. And I know it's frustrating for him to not be able to move. But I'm trying to give him as much love as I can.
loseit,fm2nl2b,t1_flxk1el,1585701230.0,Thanks! I try to remind myself of this a lot. So instead he's better than a quick fix that's probably going to fall apart later on. Those first 20 lbs came off pretty easy but now I'm in a slump but I know I just have to keep adjusting my intake and more exercising. :-)
gameofthrones,flw0vf3,t3_fre1f4,1585536797.0,"That's awesome! I'm waiting for us to get more N95 masks. I wear a special kind that only a few of us wear here and we only have one box of them to share between two hospitals, one that's also an ER and then two urgent cares. I have mine and I keep it in a brown bag and reuse it. Recently one of the straps broke on it so it doesn't fit as tightly on my face as it should. I think it's really insane how We're lacking in PPE pretty scary. Very grateful for your mother and her kindness."
atheism,fltlowj,t3_fqud8x,1585478273.0,I love living in Texas... such a beautiful state but DAMN do I hate the backward ass thinking they have it. I feel so ALONE all the time here. I sometimes feel as if I'll never find love because how different I am. I am so OPENED minded compared to the others here. Ugh. It is awful Tx is using this time to push their stupid agendas.
loseit,fltkykv,t1_flsv4wp,1585477382.0,Same! I'm so grateful!

loseit,flqr4gz,t1_flo7psd,1585404035.0,Thank you! I just wish it hadn't took me almost 10 years to figure out how to lose weight properly. Also leaving a toxic abusive job for a better wonderful job helped a lot too. And thank you! Rootung for you too!
loseit,flnpvrd,t3_fpraxp,1585323591.0,I agree. Understand 100% I wasn't losing weight Even though I was working out a lot. My sister finally convinced me to count my calories and HOLY SHIT was I eating way OVER. I started counting and writing EVERYTHING down in MyFitnessPal and have lost 20lbs since end of September last year. I know it may not seem like a lot but I'm doing so much better than I ever was.  It's been a lot of trial and error trying to learn how to eat foods that help me stay full and it's been difficult because I'm anxiety and depression but I'm so proud that I've come this far. I am 155lb right now and my goal is 145! (Though 140 would be great) :)
TwoXChromosomes,flnp9hy,t3_fpoa1u,1585323248.0,Texas has made it to where you cant have one during covid and I think it is bullshit. I fear for the women of Texas. I love living in Texas but lot its backass thinking scares me.

AskReddit,fldpsa9,t3_fo40be,1585069330.0,Massive self hate. People know I have anxiety and depression and low self-esteem but they don't realize how bad it is. Sometimes I look in the mirror and feel so disgusting I just want to kill myself. I know it's all in my head and nothing's truly wrong with me physically and it wad caused by years of sexual abuse as a child/pre-teen (which I know wasn't my fault) but the self hate is so deep. I could never understand how anyone could ever love me or want to be with me let alone look at me. It makes me so sad because all I want to to is love myself. I am 28 and still have no idea of how to look into the mirror and feel okay with what I see. It makes me feel awful and more self hate because others actually have real issues and problems and I don't so feeling this way just causes more hate.
AskReddit,fldottj,t3_fnwkzt,1585068795.0,I have co-workers who are panic hair-cutting. I am a woman and my hair grows fast but I haven't had a haircut by someone professional in years! Haven't I cut my shower I grab some scissors and tell my mom to cut a line. So I am good.
funny,flc45va,t1_flbmvhu,1585019440.0,This is hilarious.
Anxiety,fl8saus,t3_fn0oph,1584931072.0,I feel this everyday. If a co-worker or anyone kind of makes an expression at me or their tone sounds off I immediately think they hate me.
TaylorSwift,fl8qwvw,t3_fn6jz8,1584930103.0,I think Red is her best album. I love all of her albums but none has hit me the way Red has.
sex,fl8qjea,t3_fn2s6w,1584929845.0,Always horny but six years  and going on more single...  Sucks so fucking much. But don't see that changing. I know being single doesn't mean I can't have sex with a guy but I'd rather be with the person. Anyways... I feel ya on this.
TwoXChromosomes,fl5xogc,t3_fmldc5,1584848446.0,I so wish I had a boyfriend to cuddle up with... I've been single for over 6 years and I honestly feel like I'm never going to be in a relationship again. I'm 28 and feel so fucking lonely all the time just seems impossible to find someone. I feel ya on this one.
depression,fl2vw6e,t3_fm54ll,1584761294.0,"I hate myself too. But, we should strive to change that. I know it's difficult and seems impossible. Maybe you don't even want to. But we deserve love and deserve happiness... even if we don't want to believe it. I hope that you're reaching out to people or a therapist or doctor. I hope You Love yourself one day just as I want to love myself. Good luck on your journey! From a stranger on the internet."
childfree,fkrfzg3,t1_fkpob7g,1584468118.0,Haha great!
childfree,fkrfybn,t1_fkq45l1,1584468100.0,Thanks and I love your reply!!! That is great one. Oh yeah I've been doing tons of research. And the doctor that I'm going to go to she's actually one recommended on the list. So I'm excited about it!
childfree,fkpaoak,t1_fkoxol1,1584405638.0,Haha oh man! I see my comments being downvoted. Oh well I guess the truth hurts. I guess my real advice is just to be as polite as can be.
childfree,fkpakhm,t1_fkox9l4,1584405567.0,Thank you! I really hope my insurance is right and I don't have to pay anything. Because I want to so badly! I actually found one of the doctors on the list in this subreddit actually lives in the city I go to so I'm going to go to her! Because they're actually in my network. :)
childfree,fkox4gu,t3_fjsv02,1584396948.0,"Anytime I find out someone's pregnant or has kids I always say""Oh. I'm sorry."" And they look at me strangely and then burst into laughter thinking I'm joking. Because I have a sarcastic sense of humor. And I smile and chuckle.... Because I'm not joking. :)

Edit: But then I ask, ""What are you gonna name it?"" Or ""what's your kids name's?"" Because  I do want to know about my friends/coworkers. Even if I don't want kids or care for them."
childfree,fkowv8f,t3_fjs504,1584396787.0,That is great!! I have a lot of people telling me they won't let me get fixed because I'm 28 about to be 29. I'm too young. But I keep seeing other stories of people way younger than me getting a down. It's time for people to face the facts that women know what they want. I can't wait to get mine done! I have to contact my gynecologist because I found out that I'm pretty sure it's completely covered under my insurance. Fingers crossed it is!
SkincareAddiction,fko2nxg,t1_fkmjot1,1584378931.0,Thanks! I don't use acids anymore since starting tret but I really want to try adding something extra in to my routine.
SkincareAddiction,fkmfsga,t3_fivlds,1584327957.0,Can I use the ordinary Aha 30% + bha 2% peeling solution on nights I don't use my 0.5% tretinoin? I know you're only supposed to be use the peel about two times a week. Would you still get the same results using it once a week? Thanks!
AskReddit,fkkpyre,t3_fiyxg4,1584289483.0,Lelouch from Code Geass and Light from Death Note. (List goes on haha)

Unexpected,fjzexk2,t3_ffgjpy,1583718128.0,Uhm more importantly is it okay? Did they save it again?
OkCupid,fjxlkw6,t1_fjrgmf3,1583677222.0,This has been my problem. I'm not religious and I don't want kids and I want a serious relationship. People who keep sending me messages are completely opposite. I'll look at their profile completely and they're super religious and they want to find someone to have kids with. And I'm just like are you kidding me? Please just read my profile. Because I'm not having kids and no one's changing my mind. Also I feel like if you're extremely religious you probably shouldn't date someone who is extremely not religious..... I wish people would actually read profiles.

childfree,fjm48fp,t1_fjlseq1,1583461240.0,Thanks! I have BCBS so guess they don't cover it sadly. I don't like BC because the side effects and fact it isn't 100% Getting pregnant is my biggest fear. I NEVER want to be pregnant.  I have a doctor here I want to talk to but worry about the price. Thanks for reply!
childfree,fjlhxpq,t3_fdzrvf,1583446929.0,congratulations it's amazing! How exactly it's a conversation go down? I want to do this. One of the doctors on the list and a sidebar is actually in the city I live in. I want to see her but I want to make sure I'm say the right things. I'm worried that my insurance isn't going to pay for it.
childfree,fjj2zks,t3_fdpb63,1583381947.0,that's great! I'll be happy to hear your story especially the insurance. I really really really want to get my surgery. But I'm pretty sure my insurance won't cover it.
childfree,fjj2qi0,t3_fdj01j,1583381757.0,"That's awesome! Congratulations!!! I really want mine done but I'm terrified my insurance won't cover it. And I have no idea how I would get $5,000. But pregnancy is my biggest fear."
