AskReddit,fph9999,t3_gd9lck,1588617201.0,"I applied for a job last year and on the application, I put my availability for a phone call. The person who called disregarded it and I ended up not being able to answer because I was at work at the time. She left a message and sounded a little annoyed that I didn't answer, so I tried calling back and got a voicemail for a completely different person. I ignored it and figured I'd email her the next day. Around the same time the next day, 9 am, I get another call from an unknown number. Again, I'm working so I can't answer. I check my voicemail later and she left another, unprofessional voicemail referencing her trying to contact me again, but that I won't pick up. Again, I call the number and it goes to someone else. At this point I figure she's using burner numbers, so I won't be able to get through to her by phone, so I email her and give her my availability for the next few days. The next day, another call from an unknown number and another unprofessional voicemail telling me to just let her know if I'm not interested in the job anymore. At this point I gave up and stopped even listening to any emails.

I work 10 hour shifts, take public transit to and from work, and I'm one of the only full time techs still working during this. I'm very aware of the situation.

I remember thinking while I watched that season that she was going to get a wakeup call when she watched herself back on TV. I think that's what happened. Something about her on season 17 (I'm not done with it yet) seemed very desperate for respect from her teammates and she seemed to reign in her personality a little more. There was something almost pathetic about her on season 17 and I hope she got help. She struggled a lot on season 17.

She's definitely overcompensating and has a huge ego problem, but overall she's entertaining as hell. For me I guess, it always depends on the delivery and the four I already mentioned are so delusional and overly aggressive that I can't even try to find a redeeming quality.

Show me one person who isn't  ""damaged"" in some way. Everyone has shit they have to work through. You are doing what you need to do to get through this. Reliving the awful things you went through while talking to your lawyer has to be unimaginably difficult. If anything, I'd say that by putting yourself through that to fight for justice for yourself isn't you being ""damaged."" It's you being a strong ass woman who is taking care of herself. You're a fucking superhero. 

  
I'm sorry for everything you have been through. I can't even imagine. If this is the way your boyfriend acts when you need him, he doesn't care about you. No, he doesn't need to be your therapist, but when you commit to someone, you commit to being there for them during the good times and the bad. It sounds like he either lacks empathy, only cares about himself, or he likes hurting you. Any way you slice it, it's shit.

No. Fuck that shit. I see so many people on here with abusive, selfish, shitty family members and when they are finally tired of putting up with their shit, they are told by other people to forget about it and be the bigger person. You don't have to be the bigger person. You already are. Your entire family is a fucking mess and it took something as messed up as your siblings telling you to kill yourself to realize it. You probably will never get an apology because in their minds, it's all always your fault and you deserved it. You're the scapegoat of the family. You deserve better than this and you should really consider cutting all contact with them. At least for a while so you can think about what kind of relationship (if any) you want to have with them going forward. 

  
You do not deserve to be treated the way you have been. Your oldest sister is a piece of shit. Your brother is a piece of shit. They do not deserve to have you in their lives after this shit. I'm sorry for the anger in my reply but I'm fucking livid for you. No one deserves to be treated that way by their family and no one needs to be the bigger fucking person just to placate people who abuse them and put their best interest aside to keep the peace with abusive family members.

It started when I was 12 and the closer I got to 18, the more explicit he got with the things he said. Like the fact that I was 18 gave him the go ahead to start actually trying to have sex with me despite being unwilling. In this man's mind, you are an object for him to do what he wants with.

  
If I were you, I would start recording audio on my phone whenever I'm alone with him. You need proof. You said in the comments that your mom probably heard what he said, which makes me think that she is ok with what is happening or scared to say anything about it. What you said about pushing them apart when they're kissing is telling to me. It's extremely common for moms who are told about their husbands' predatory behavior to blame the young girl for trying to ""take their man."" I could see them using the fact that you don't want them to show physical affection as jealousy and a reason to blame you.

  

You need proof of what he says so that you can tell a counselor, therapist, or even a police officer. I know what you are going through is traumatic and it's scary. But if you don't start recording him and recording proof, there's nothing stopping him from doing the same to your sister when  you eventually move out.

But you have the opportunity to change the narrative for this child, and you are an amazing person for stepping up and taking that on. You should speak with a lawyer. Your mother having legal custody is probably going to be an issue, especially when she decides she wants to play mommy to the baby again.

AmItheAsshole,fixyqqz,t3_f7z0gi,1582829068.0,"NAH. I think you're doing any future pet a favor by driving away the potential dog donor from your house. I work with animals on a daily basis and have an intense love for dogs. Honestly, I get not wanting an animal in the house if you have a phobia or something, and if that's the case, you should really talk to a counselor. You never know when you may come into contact with an animal in your daily life. It sounds like you just think dogs are disgusting though. Most don't eat their own shit and you sound incredibly ignorant when it comes to dogs. Luckily you can move out in 2 years. In the meantime, just calmly reiterate to your mom that you don't want a dog in the house until you've graduated and moved out. There has to be some kind of compromise you can make with her. In the meantime, you should really consider talking to someone. The fact that you're happy that an animal died because it benefitted you is extremely troubling. Good luck.

Edit: it's also kind of baffling to me the number of people telling you to move out or that you don't deserve to be comfortable in your own home. Parents should always take their childrens' feelings into account when they make decisions that are effect them. Maybe mention that to your mom. Idk. I know a lot of animal lovers see this differently, but it feels like shit when your feelings aren't a priority to your parents."

I'm so proud of you for having the courage to remove yourself from that situation. Something that concerns me with your story is the mention of your husband not feeling well prior, and then experiencing severe mood swings. Is there a possibility that he has some kind if injury? I'm not saying it's an excuse for his actions, but could be an explanation. This seems like someone who should see a doctor as soon as possible. You should get a check up as well after experiencing such a traumatic event. Wishing you all the best.

Edit: because you are most likely (and understandably) not ready to interact with him at all, you can always call the non emergency police line and request a welfare check to be safe. If this behavior is new for him, then there could be underlying medical issues to blame."

I'm so sorry that your mother is choosing a rapist over you. That is so fucked. I agree with the commenter who said she wants to make you look unfit so she can try to take custody of your daughter. If somehow that were to happen, she would be exposed to that rapist monster by your mother. Your sister and mother sound so toxic and you need to at least remove yourself from that living situation. Once you have, you really should consider pressing charges. Your sister's boyfriend has maybe done this before and will probably do it again. If worrying about the fallout from you pressing charges is a deterrent for you reporting it, then think of the other women you could be helping if you do. And because the evidence of the assault is most likely gone now, the police won't be able to do anything, but at least it will be documented for the next time he rapes someone. I'm so sorry you're going through this and I wish you all the best. 💗"
