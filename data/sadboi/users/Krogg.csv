If it isn't Aladdin being described, then it isn't, whether a redditor wants it to or not.

Also, I didn't throw in the part where Disney attempted Beauty and the Beast in the 1930s and then again in the 1950s, but scrapped both because it just wasn't working right. There was someone else named [Jean Cocteau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Cocteau) who actually made the Beauty and the Beast film in 1946. Rumor has it that Disney was discouraged with his early attempts because of this.

There's no way they would have been in production of Aladdin in the 1930s or 50s. There's no way Jean Cocteau even knew what Disney was up to in the 40s. Either way, I hesitated in bringing in this fact because I don't know what the 1946 film says here. Does she use the same line? I don't know. I know for sure that Aladdin didn't start production until April 1991, which was a full 5 months after the release of Beauty and the Beast. Likely about 8 months from when the script was polished.

I don't disagree with you that *some* Disney directors like to put in Easter eggs. I'm just saying that it is fairly well known (obviously not ""very"" since this discussion is even taking place) that the line is describing Sleeping Beauty due to all of the facts surrounding it."

Also, semantically it's no where near the same. A prince in disguise is a prince hiding his identity. Disguising yourself as a prince, is pretending to be one.

Honestly, and this isn't a stretch, but also considering Aladdin was in development after Beauty and the Beast came out. Between the book at Disney World, the prince line, and the fact Aladdin didn't even come out until a full year after Beauty and the Beast, is all pretty good evidence this just isn't true.

To each their own, though. They are both wonderful childhood movie memories for me, and I think we can agree they are great versions from the original fairy tales."

Once the kids finished school, her and her husband were going to use it as a ""launch"" pad to travel the lower 48. After a while, they decided to just sell. We asked that AC be put in and an amount went into escrow for that, but the seller would tell us constantly that she's putting a bunch of money into the house that she otherwise wouldn't need to (the house was built in the 40s and until we bought there was no AC), so we better buy the house.

Then one day she said she was just offered $30k more than listing (we were buying for the listing price) and said that it was from someone who flips houses and he was ready to pay cash. She said she would rather the house go to a family who is going to love it than someone who is just going to rebuild and sell.

Granted the market has gone to an insane height, but over the last 6 years the house just appraised at ~$80k more than our purchase price and ~$100k more than we still owe on it. We are thinking of expanding onto the house and using a HELOC, but our lender doesn't do those.

The weekly amount is set, but if I work and earn less than 1.5X my weekly amount, I still get unemployment. If I earn (remember, this is gross) more than 1.5x my weekly amount, I get nothing from unemployment (even the extra the feds are throwing out there). Here's a pretty good example of what the money would look like:

I get $400/wk from unemployment. My 1.5x is $200, adding up to $600. If I earn anything between $200 and $600, I get something. The closer to the $600 I earn, the less the weekly unemployment check is. If I qualify for even $1, I get the additional $600. So, I can earn $599, which leaves $1. My unemployment would be $601 that week. Putting my weekly total to $1,200 ($599 earned and $601 in unemployment).

If my boss decided to throw 2 weeks worth of pay at me, I would lose unemployment that week. Depending on how much that is, depends on how much from unemployment I ""lose.""

Let's say I make $500/wk from you. I get $400/wk Unemployment. That means I get the full amount of benefits. $500 from you + $100 ($600-$500) from state unemployment + $600 (Fed amount) from unemployment. Now, let's say you throw 2 weeks at me and now I got $1,000 from you. I would not qualify for any unemployment because I earned more than the $600. I didn't qualify for even $1 in unemployment, so I don't get the $600 federal. That leaves me with a total difference of -$200 that week. Then, you don't pay me the next week and I get $1,000 for unemployment ($400 from state and $600 federal). Again, that's a difference of -$200. However, when the additional federal amount dries up (I think they said end of July is when they will stop doing it?), I get $400 from unemployment and that's it. That's a difference of -$800 now.

Granted this is a weird situation, but it's used to show you how things are calculated. The employee may be in a worse situation if you did something like this. I don't know the situation you and the employee are in, so I can't say exactly, but if you put the numbers there, or the employee does, then you'll get an idea of the outcome."

Here is the 7 steps to identify if it is a legal intern/employer relationship ([This was taken directly from the U.S. Department of Labor documentation](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/legacy/files/whdfs71.pdf)):

1. The extent to which the intern and the employer clearly understand that there is no expectation of
compensation. Any promise of compensation, express or implied, suggests that the intern is an
employee—and vice versa.
2. The extent to which the internship provides training that would be similar to that which would be
given in an educational environment, including the clinical and other hands-on training provided by
educational institutions.
3. The extent to which the internship is tied to the intern’s formal education program by integrated
coursework or the receipt of academic credit.
4. The extent to which the internship accommodates the intern’s academic commitments by
corresponding to the academic calendar.
5. The extent to which the internship’s duration is limited to the period in which the internship provides
the intern with beneficial learning.
6. The extent to which the intern’s work complements, rather than displaces, the work of paid employees
while providing significant educational benefits to the intern.
7. The extent to which the intern and the employer understand that the internship is conducted without
entitlement to a paid job at the conclusion of the internship."

Temp agencies get this quite a bit because they could have 100 employees this fiscal quarter and 10 the next. The government sets their rate higher due to the number of unemployed coming out of the company. The legislation specifically states there will be no increase.

As for working 1 day a week. Refusal they are correct on. It is against the rules and you will lose your benefit, but this does not mean you will lose your benefit if you go to work for 1 day per week.

You still get to claim that you worked some hours, that your gross was x and the calculation for reduced hours still takes place. If you work 5 hours/week, chances are you still qualify for some, or all, of your weekly benefit. Since you will qualify for at least $1, you will still get the $600 the care act gives as well.

This isn't true, but there might be states that do this. As far as I know, none do.

Even if you find a new job, if it's less than you made at the last job, you may still qualify for some or all of your weekly benefit. The way it works is like this:

Your weekly benefit amount is $400. You can make gross wages up to 1.5x your weekly benefit (in this case it's $600, $400x1.5 is $600). If you make less than $600, you still get a check for that week, up to your weekly amount. In this example, if someone made $150, they would get their $400. If they made $200, they would still get their $400, but if they made $201, they would get $399. If they made $250, they would get $350. All the way down to $0 if they made $600.

2 weeks of making too much and your claim goes on suspension for the rest of the duration.

Just remember that it is **not** illegal for someone to evict you right now. What is happening is the courts just won't hear it. The legal process can still be started. Keeping in mind that eviction is the legal removal, but it means the eviction has been ordered by the judge. I think the point in this post is that it is illegal for a landlord to physically remove you from the property just because you didn't pay and they served you a notice.

The landlord can still:

give you a 3-day notice

post a notice on the property

have you served 3-day and unlawful detainer notices. 

**Edit** /u/Jblaze056 [said it better than I could](https://www.reddit.com/r/Boise/comments/fof3dj/idaho_supreme_court_declares_that_evictions_are/flf7f60/)"
Boise,flexav8,t3_fof3dj,1585093411.0,"The guidelines you linked says

> Expedited Proceedings. When rent is past due or the

possession within five to twelve days after the tenant
receives notice. The tenant also may be required to
pay the landlord’s attorney fees if the notice discloses
that attorney fees will be awarded and the landlord
wins.

It is a quick eviction system if they really want to. However, I want to clarify to everyone reading here that this is not the courts suspending evictions. All court is suspended, so the landlord can't evict you only because the court won't be open to accept paperwork/hear your case. They can still do all of the process they need to so when the courts open again it is a breezy process. This includes giving you a 3-day notice, the only difference is the 3-days will turn into several weeks, likely a month or two, depending on when the courts open up again.

Also, don't expect to not pay what you owe when the courts resume. You will still owe the rents, it will just be a much larger sum when that happens. A much larger complaint I have on the president announcing HUD won't be evicting until the end of April, if someone can't pay their rent because of this, they aren't going to be able to pay 2 months worth at once. If that program was a forgiveness of owed rents and not evicting until the end of the shutdown, then that makes sense.

B. Go to an in-state community college. The classes are way cheaper, they are basically the same material, and will transfer to your 4 year easily.

C. Don't take an accelerated program if they offer one. Usually these cut out a lot of industry information to get your foot in the door as quickly as possible, and if you are like me it just didn't work. Which leads me into my next point..

D. I went to a Community College to get my associate's degree. It was an accelerated program for software development with the promise the credits transfer to online in-state programs to complete a degree. I decided I didn't want an online education, which ended up being a terrible idea. I am now in student loan debt (I have a wife and started this little adventure with only 2 kids, ended the 2 year program with 4, so I needed the loans to support the family). I still got an online education because that's just what the classes are doing now. The credits won't transfer to the 4 year university directly into the CS degree, but I can get a Bachelor of Applied Science with a minor in CS, then use the Bachelor to get into a Master's program in CS. I've yet to decide what I want to do there.

I've been working for a software company for more than 6 months and I am not a senior by any means, and I probably lucked out in this, so your mileage may vary. However:

I just turned 35 in Feb. I am getting real world experience. Almost nothing I learned in the program I use today. Will that change in the future? Likely. I work on a team of 4. The company definitely does things differently than what I read about all the time (we push our code changes directly into master with no code check-in or code-review, for example). Again, your mileage may vary.

My point in all of this is that anything is possible. Start networking now, and you will be surprised how easy it will be to find something when you are done. Take on personal projects, check leetcode (but don't get discouraged if you can't solve problems right away), and network. That's about all I can say.

Boise,fl3nrsj,t3_fm7c4z,1584792233.0,"One thing to add:

You can still file even if your hours have just been reduced. If you normally work 40 hours and you were cut to 35, file. If you normally work 35 and your hours were cut to 25, file. If you worked 30 and cut to 25, file. See where that is going?

The rule is you can still be working, but make no more than 1.5 times the weekly benefit (amount you get each week on unemployment) and still get a weekly check. The math is like this and numbers are for easy math:

* Weekly benefit: $300

* 1.5 times weekly benefit: $450

* Amount you can make still working before losing even $1 from the weekly benefit: $450-300 = $150.

If you make $150 in the week, you will still get your entire $300 benefit check. Anything after that, up to $450 will deduct from your weekly benefit until it hits $0. For instance:

* You make $200 in the week, you will still get a $250 benefit check.

* If you make $300 in the week, you will still get a $150 benefit check.

* If you make $400 in the week, you will still get a $50 benefit check.

**Disclaimer** this is all considering you do the weekly filing each week and you must use gross income numbers. Also, your weekly benefit amount is going to vary, but this is a rough idea of how this works. If your weekly benefit is $375, then your 1.5 times is $562.50, etc. etc.

Lastly, if you do work normal amount of hours for 2 weeks in a row, your unemployment will go into suspension. This doesn't mean you lose it, it just means that until you are laid off/fired/hours are reduced again, you won't get anything. When/if that happens, you won't have a waiting week and you won't have a new determination so your weekly benefit will be the same. This is as long as you go back on it within 12 months of your first filing.

One key piece of advice? Don't try to game the system, but take advantage of a benefit your employer reduced your compensation package for. Most people think they pay for this, they do not directly pay for this. However, the employer knows how much it's going to cost them bringing on any new employee, and it's not just their hourly wage/salary. There are costs like insurances, taxes, space to keep the employee, coffee in the office, water cooler, etc. etc. Unemployment insurance is taken into account here. Your pay was reduced by this amount to account for such costs and you agreed it was a fair deal, so you took it. Now, you need to use that insurance, use it to it's full potential."
