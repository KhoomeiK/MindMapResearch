The revenue from sales is more than substantial,there's really no need to charge sick people to be able to spend more money. It's really fucked up.In glad to have it,but I wish it weren't all so spit on."

Caliburn,Moti,Nord, Novo,Infinix,Vladdin,all good salt devices,more juice for your dollar,not to mention battery life and non-proprietary USB charging .

Anxiety,fgffays,t3_exx6jc,1580737057.0,"I'm from a small town,
Not long ago I took a job driving a box truck
through the busiest parts of Orlando,all day,6 days a week. I'm used to my tiny town,and small cars..
I would have panic attacks like I've never had, that almost made me physically incapable of driving. Any unexpected noise was the worst thing I'd ever heard. 
I Also have ADHD, and I've been more and more irritated by noise, especially repetition as I age .
I'm a Drummer, so it makes no sense for me to be bothered by repetition, Sensory Overload definitely would explain things"
AskReddit,fezvp4c,t3_eqies2,1579462266.0,"I have a dresser that was given to me when I was one or two. It has four drawers each with a letter,spelling my name.im 31 now,I still have it. I've used it in various ways and purposes over the years and defaced it with plenty of stickers and permanent marker in my teenage years.
When I was about 25 or 26 I decided to experiment with psychedelics, mainly with what I thought to be LSD at the time but turned out to be 25i nbome. Rather than a topsy-turvy world of hallucination I felt more attuned to endless possibilities and realms or demensions,so to speak.
No I know this is where the story seems to have explanation, what I experienced to be a result of the psychedelics. It was the day after a trip, I was sitting there trying to process and recollect epiphanies from the day before. At this point the dresser was being used in my living room as the TV stand, and to my fiance's request it was turned around backward with the drawers facing the wall, to hide said marker and band / skate stickers, where the back was just solid unpainted wood.
I was kind of staring into space in that direction thinking when all of the sudden I saw two very prominent eyes in the blank wood. My heart sank. I couldn't look away. And that's when I noticed all the detail. The neck the nose the mouth the ears the light source in the eyes the very detailed irises. Humanoid but not quite human.

I haven't used a psychedelic since, yet it is still there. Very plain to see. I spent a few years trying to rationalize it, trying to come up with ways that a bored  lumber worker could somehow have put it there,etc
Nope. 
Ocassionally I'll dragil it the out of the shed 
To show someone, everyone sees it. 
I can't explain it. 
It wasn't put there by hands, it's in the grain."
electronic_cigarette,fap86yn,t3_c8lwxa,1576282344.0,"just ordered one. Wasn't  happy with 
The breeze,sourin air,hacking Alto pods,the Moti,countless pens, mods and tanks, hoping this keeps me content for a while . For salts I currently have the Zlide but the plexus coils seem to be all hype.
It sounds like I can live w the cons of this one,(I still wish I never gave away my moon box.)
Good Review üëç"
Vaping101,fabklat,t1_faao8l0,1575924638.0,"I have a solo in hand right now.
They are great little things, definitely resilient. One thing for anyone considering purchasing one is you'll need a higher amperage battery. If you use a standard 18650 it will drop the wattage 10-20 w.I know because I have two solo devices, and one adequate battery (hohm life 35a)"

I vape about the duration of a cigarette, admittedly often(3-4 times an HR),but I feel like I've been walking on eggshells with this mod and it is still losing battery rapidly. I may have to check into the Shogun or save the uforce for something else and put some kind of MTL on the drag Mini."
