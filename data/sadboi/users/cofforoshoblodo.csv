 I think that the likely solution is a change in communication strategy.

I've been studying about Street Epistemology, though I don't know if it's appropriate, but I think how they discuss beliefs is obviously non-confrontational.

I doubt an ultimatum will work long term. He may seem stubborn and selfish, but actually IMO the last thing a psychotic person needs is to feel even more powerless.

What's real for you is the anxiety and fear. Paranoid feeling is valid even if the content is not. People telling you it's not true doesn't help because the content is secondary to the distress. If you were in a different time or situation, you would be paranoid about different things.

Psychosis,fimncw0,t3_f8oryq,1582538387.0,That sounds shitty. Is that made worse by the environment you're in? Or is your sexual preference generally accepted? And do you have face to face support of people who've been through a similar thing?
Psychosis,fimda92,t3_f8kp2f,1582525803.0,"How does their disapproval affect your life? It sucks if they don't understand, but it sounds like you're sure it helps."
Psychosis,fikh0jp,t3_f8apr8,1582480180.0,"The International OCD Foundation recommends 'Exposure and response prevention' (ERP) and/or medication.

It says it is less common for people to respond to both methods. 

The Anxiety and Depression Alliance recommends cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which includes ERP.

Psychosis,fikfdyw,t3_f8bm5z,1582479312.0,"Headphones. Sunglasses. Watch my attention (it's usually like a pinball machine, so I try to anchor it in something. I'd like to say my breath, but most likely my phone. Or the feeling of my feet on the ground)"
Psychosis,fijbcxs,t1_fijalnq,1582440713.0,"I try not to do anything with anger. Accept it. Exercise helps if it feels like it's poisoning my body. 

There wasnt much of an internet the first time I had an episode. But I had to detach from radio for about six months, and minimal TV. Much harder now."
Psychosis,fij9jth,t1_fij8l07,1582438777.0,"Yeah I relate. I get spooked occasionally online.

The way I think about it, if it's real, then I should feel angry not afraid. Unless I'm feeling guilty. And if it's not real, it's a signal from my brain that it is overstimulated.

There are temporary measures you can take, which I don't find easy, but even taking a brief break may help. I don't *need* to do 90% of the stuff I do online. I have a phone with no internet that I occasionally switch to. 

I actually hired a storage locker once and put all my devices in it. It helped although it was a bit extreme and I kept having to drive to go check my email twice a day."
Psychosis,fij86zm,t3_f829ta,1582437460.0,"I experienced this for a long time and it reduced significantly once I shifted to an environment that I felt more safe in. And stopped smoking weed. And started taking medication from a psychiatrist.

Moving also meant I was in a place where I was sleeping at regular hours and eating three meals a day. And I was no longer feeling terrible about constantly missing class. 
 
I have no idea how much of that applies to you. You didn't mention anything about weed but I hope you can reduce the pressure around you and create a safe space."
Psychosis,fih7lut,t3_f7yizg,1582407343.0,Do you experience similar things when you're not outside on a street? Is it a symptom of being in an environment where you don't feel safe?
Psychosis,fia2nsq,t3_f77hap,1582291336.0,Can you discuss it with whoever prescribed the oxy? And what happened with the cops?
