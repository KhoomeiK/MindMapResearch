EDAnonymous,ffwm3s6,t3_evkiq8,1580305216.0,"yeah man i work as a barista and i was shocked when figuring out how many calories oat milk has. i’m not sure about starbucks but the coffee shop i work at has coconut milk too which is much lower 
also the reason it is higher than regular oat milk you’d buy is because in order to steam correctly the milk needs more fat so they have to add some to it adding more calories too"
TalkTherapy,ffsmtd5,t3_ev0h3x,1580185719.0,i constantly feel guilty for feeling like my problems aren’t big enough to be there but really you can talk about anything in therapy you’re paying for their time. i also feel like it’s normal for things to come up and start working on new things throughout therapy or maybe start focusing on the root of your drinking habits? figure out why you rely on it? good luck to you
