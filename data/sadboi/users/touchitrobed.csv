CoronavirusUK,fqp30kl,t3_gk4jey,1589533203.0,"Blatant propaganda  - Johnson and the Tories have done a terrible job and other people have truly suffered because of this. 

- Not enough testing
- Not enough PPE
- No testing, quarantining of people arriving in the UK or shutting of the borders
- Allowing the virus to spread in care homes (releasing confirmed or suspected patients into care homes)
- Bragging about shaking patients hands 
- Only locking down because Macron of France told him to and locking down too late
- He has multiple other children he won't acknowledge, why is that forgotten but this kid suddenly matters?
- Due to the above we will have to lockdown longer - so the economy will tank.

We don't live in a bubble, this is bullshit that must be challenged."

Boris/the gov didn't time the lockdown correctly because it doesn't work like that - the later you lockdown the worse the peak. You tailor your actions to affect the spread, 'timing' the peak is like saying the virus behaves in a fixed way that we have to work around.

Sorry I'm tired and feel like I'm not explaining this correctly, does that make any sense?"

- Intermittent Reinforcement 

- Making subtle put downs of me (Saying I had small hands, the drums are a bad instrument that ruin songs knowing that I'm a drummer etc)

- Ghosting me or using anger if I tried to talk to her about any issues I had 

- Once told me months in suddenly that the amount of people I slept with was 'disgusting, immoral, and if she had known she wouldn't have dated me' (I told her this when she asked a few days into dating, and the number isn't that high!)

- Made disparaging comments about my mental health, never let me go to her house and told me I couldn't meet her friends or family until my MH got better

- In our last month together would switch her opinions of me/us on the fly, in one evening she told me she was enjoying our last few times until I broke up with her, then she said she was happier alone (day before said she would never be alone cos of me) then she said she had spoken to her mum about us living together!?!
