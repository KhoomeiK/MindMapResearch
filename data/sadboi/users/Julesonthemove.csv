depression,eymf6sh,t3_cxbnat,1567207367.0,Well ya but its because for over a year every day amd night 24/7 my life is on tv for the whole world to watch my every breath and theres nothing i can do about it - theres an ex who just feels better about himself by revenge porn and shaming me by paying people to lie about me so i already tried suicide - even though i just wanted and still do it all to stop - if i say a name i get threatened cuz they listen to everything i say and they have the gall to be pissed about what i say - but really they shouldn't even be invading my privacy - now my family has turned against me amd theyre on HIS side and cuz of all the viral videos theres NOWHERE i can go where people wont laugh at me and give me dirty looks like total strangers - so now you can feel better about your issues - should i pack a bag ans wait til my kids asleep amd jump on a grehound bus and disappear? Or do i go the whole 9 ( restraing order domestic violence shelter etc) ??
