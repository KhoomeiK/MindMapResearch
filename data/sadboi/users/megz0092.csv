Especially for those vulnerable in care homes with dementia. I'd be reporting to CQC.

AmItheAsshole,fmrvtd0,t3_fwmddu,1586337309.0,"I've been in this situation, only the age gap was smaller. I was 11 when my sister was born. I remember being about 14, and she was about 3, and had been fully toilet trained (sounds like she's a dog haha!) - however this meant that everytime we went out, she inevitably needed to go to the toilet. Well the nearest one was in Mothercare... You can imagine the looks I got and I over heard comments where they assumed I was an incredibly young teenage Mum. My response - after she was finished I purposely walked past those I heard commenting and said ""come on sis! Let's go find Mum now!"" (Loud enough for people to hear). They suddenly started the usual bumbling that occurs when a British person is proven wrong...

I even had it when someone assumed my brother (who is 2 and a half years younger than me) was my boyfriend and my sister was our child! So wrong!!

Not once did I let it stop me hanging out with her, or taking her out on my own. This continued for years! Until she became taller than me when she was 12...

People can assume all they want. They are the huge AHs for making that assumption. But I'll say this, in a soft way - YTA if you let other people, who do not matter, interfere with the relationship you have with your brother. I am 27 now (nearly 28) and my sister is 16, and we have more of a friendship than siblings, and I put that down to the fact that I did spend so much time with her when she was younger. And she would say the same thing!"

unitedkingdom,fl3quec,t1_fl3qbpv,1584795400.0,"I agree no one should be left out and we should all have the safety net. It isn't fair as it stands right now. People are being left out. That being said one day we complain about a group being left behind and then the news changes the next day, so it will probably change in the next couple of days anyway. 

I'm not accusing either and saying you personally weren't already doing that. But it only works if everyone has the same mindset as yourself and finds ways to help."
unitedkingdom,fl3pwr0,t3_fmceir,1584794506.0,"How about those people that don't think it'll be enough to help, and are healthy and able to (obviously those vulnerable can't do this) - start working in the supermarkets that are screaming for help right now. Or apply to work on your local NHS Trust as a bank worker/cleaner, because they're going to need more workers. They're already looking at bringing people out of retirement to help.

Find a way to work in the key workers roles. That way you're helping to give back and help out! 

The more money we ask for from the government now, the more money the younger generations will be paying back. And the economy was already buggered before this, so can only imagine the long term damage this will do.

Will it be enough to cover the rent/mortgage and bills,  probably not. But it'll probably still be more than SSP, or Universal Credit!

Are these jobs going to be as glamorous or as higher class as the ones you've previously had? More than likely not. But that's when people need to look at the bigger picture. Rather than complain that the government aren't doing enough, first of all look at yourself and see if you are doing enough."

Scotland,evjdm4i,t3_ck4h54,1564560367.0,"You say 15% of military... Is that the actual bases? Or those that serve too? ü§î Cause I'm curious to find those that would leave the British Armed Forces to fight for the ""Scottish Defence Force"" as I believe it would be called... 
I know of Scots in the British Forces, and have yet to find one that say they would ""jump ship"" and joint the Scottish forces if the option was given. I could just happen to know those in the minority, I don't know ü§∑
Can image that if the British Armed Forces were to move out of Scotland and take their assets with them, it would only cause damage to the local economy around each of those bases? 
In turn the Scottish government would have to pay out to build up their new defence force, purchasing assets, man power, setting up a new infrastructures etc, etc... That in itself would cost billions if not trillions. 
15% of the military... But then would have to protect those 62% of sea area, oil resources, the airspace etc. 
That's just the physical defence. You then have cyber defence forces (with the Chinese and Russians this is a huge issue), Scottish equivalent of GCHQ, MI5, SIS, NCA.
This is just one aspect of the Scottish independence that I can't get my head around, I can only see it costing. If I'm wrong then I'm wrong, I'm open to looking at how it can work."
