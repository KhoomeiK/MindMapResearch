selfharm,fmdnp9d,t3_fumvog,1585972602.0,"I think it's a good goal, I think giving yourself incentive beyond just being healthy can be helpful and I wish you luck and strength friend."
StopSelfHarm,fl04qj3,t1_fl01jsa,1584691478.0,I posted a list of stuff in the comments above.  If you have any questions let me know. :)
StopSelfHarm,fkowuhp,t1_fknxbae,1584396775.0,"I track it on the app you see above, if you check sobriety counter apps on any app store you can find one like it.  Seeing the number grow helps a lot.  I'm also not drinking, started not drinking at 100 days clean of self harm and it made keeping it going a lot easier, but me and alcohol aren't good pals so it may not be a big difference maker for you.  I have things I do when I want to self harm to distract from it, I usually try to be around a couple people if I can manage it, the crowd makes it much harder to do and I often improve my mood in those environments as well.  I've struggled getting this far and I may break any day now but everyday I don't is a commitment to myself and only myself to keep healing.  Picking yourself back up after a relapse and putting a month together can be the hardest part.  I also go to therapy and post on this burner account that didn't end up being much of a burner account and I recommend both.  More than anything though, believe you can, cause I believe you can."
StopSelfHarm,fkow7c9,t1_fkoeacs,1584396371.0,"Almost a week, that's a tough one, but you can do it."
CPTSD,fkjq7ms,t1_fkjnqza,1584254830.0,"Trying the meditation thing and I have some cbd so I'll try that as well.  Thank you.  I'm already doing a little better, sober enough to be embarrassed."
UnsentLetters,fk2foub,t3_fg4uf1,1583800022.0,"This is healthy.  Painful I'm sure but healthy.  You admit your pain, and the desire for things to be different.  Yet you know and state your own worth.  That's very hard.  Good job.  I hope healing continues to come your way."
raisedbynarcissists,fjwtucj,t3_ff80vt,1583645723.0,"My family would get together without me more and more frequently, knowing how it hurt me.  I'm blind and can't drive so they could get together 30 minutes away and exclude me if they wanted and often did.  When I shared how hurt I was they took my niece and nephew to see Santa without me they gaslit and made me feel like a burden.  After being begged to come to Christmas after not speaking for weeks my father angrily told me to go to therapy to fix it.  I'd been in therapy for a decade working on myself to get through the childhood abuse while they refused to change and it was being asked of me again.  Upon making that complaint I was told I made up my childhood abuse and was simply sick and spiteful.  Christmas day 2018 was the last we spoke. I thought it'd be impossible but while hard, was one the best decisions I've made."
raisedbynarcissists,fjwqq78,t3_ff7n11,1583643343.0,I find it doesn't always matter how common or uncommon a punishment was but more about the spirit in which it was given that decides if it is harmful.  I do think the level of enjoyment your mom is getting from telling the story when it clearly bothers you is definitely a violation.
raisedbynarcissists,f4pf9t4,t1_f4pd9ox,1571727596.0,I think I'll be with some people but trauma and mental illness is destroying relationships fast for me so we'll see.  Thank you.
TrueOffMyChest,f1oqbu0,t1_f1oq6oy,1569657313.0,"Hope it gets better man, it's embarrassing but by no means uncommon.  Best of luck."
SuicideWatch,f1oq9ej,t1_f1opzhy,1569657205.0,"I'm not here to justify how cops act at all sometimes  you're right but they're trained not to do what you want them to here.  I can tell you that with the plan you've shown above you're gonna end up hurting and in a lot of trouble but not dead like you want.  Rather than call 911 and do this, why not call someone and tell them you want to do this, I know first hand that's got it's own set of problems attached and may not even be an option for you but if it is I hope you choose it instead, it's far more likely you'll end up getting help or at least feeling better long term than with the plan in the original post.  I really hope you feel better."
TrueOffMyChest,f1oq00d,t3_daciwc,1569656796.0,"You taking any medications? At your age that would be by far the most common cause of this.  If not I'd talk to your doctor, it's awkward but what they're their for."
SuicideWatch,f1opo8b,t3_daczrd,1569656302.0,"It won't work, you'll get tased more than likely, piss yourself, end up on a psych watch and probably end up with a felony charge you'll be able to plead down to a misdemeanor but it'll be a headache and money you don't want to spend and possible jail time."
raisedbynarcissists,f0i13fm,t3_d4zfja,1568634212.0,"I've been no contact for almost year now and I can only imagine how much of a violation this must feel like and how odd it must be to try to explain it to people and hurtful to not always be supported.  That's messed up, I'm sorry."
SuicideWatch,f03ixi1,t1_f03imf8,1568356703.0,Anything insurance (Medicaid) isn't paying for has to be cheap.  CBD hasn't be effective for me cost or pain wise. Weed isn't terribly effective but bless it I have plenty of cheap access to it.
SuicideWatch,f03ihh4,t1_f03i5j8,1568356338.0,"My head and my back are messed up, causes a situation where every inch of my body hurts.  I see doctors, smoke weed, take pills, get injections, little helps."

mentalhealth,evrpm3l,t3_cky8je,1564714747.0,"I love edibles but it ain't for everyone especially if it's a pattern.  It'll pass my dude, but I do think if you can find a buddy to chill with it'll help you out.  If not maybe just some chillcore music or something light to listen with dim lighting."
mentalhealth,evroo9t,t3_cky8je,1564713992.0,"Did you make them yourself? Over 30 hours is a lot and if you don't know who made them or if they were sketchy maybe call a friend have them sit with you for a while or go to a med center, could've had some weird mold.  I've found most people I know who have had bad trips eating or smoking had moldy weed and it's the mold that fucks ya not the weed."
unpopularopinion,eucg96p,t1_eucfdu2,1563674218.0,"20% is too high 1% is too low, if that's true and you have kids (or anyone who's numbers are those) I'd recommend you read into studies of children who regularly are dealt corporal punishment, and occurrences of aggressivion, depression and other mental health issues cause they come in sometimes higher than 20 depending on severity which I'm not accusing you of commiting or advocating for in anyway.  I'd never play a numbers game with my kids mental health on something universally panned in today's medical field like spanking.  I do appreciate the good faith answer though."
unpopularopinion,eucf3eg,t3_cftgz6,1563673302.0,"If I told you even presented the right way with right intentions, with everything done 100% correctly that corporal punishment could still have severe negative emotional effects on your children (studies show this) would you still do it?  I don't feel it's worth the risk no matter how small that even if done correctly it won't have really bad outcomes later on, having seen them for myself."
raisedbynarcissists,eqr2c2r,t1_eqr23w7,1560244256.0,"It's ok to cry, especially when things really hurt and we all know how much this does.  Your stuffed sushi sounds adorable, give it one more hug and try to get some sleep.  I really hope tomorrow is better for both of us, and if it's not there's always support here."
raisedbynarcissists,eqr25o5,t1_eqr1vhi,1560243957.0,"That's probably fair.  Best case scenario they want to see if I'm ok then end up trying to justify my parents behavior in a friendly but condescending way.  The more grizzly parts of the family history is stuff they weren't around for so it's not like I have a negative opinion of their friends but I don't feel comfortable talking to them or having them see my posts, even if none of it is note worthy.  I hope that doesn't come off to them as rude or ungrateful because again, not bad people but it is what it is and I don't see it changing.  I appreciate your input a lot.  I'm not letting them in, thank you for reminding me that's ok."
raisedbynarcissists,eqr1dbn,t3_bz9r7p,1560242662.0,"My mental PTSD and depression from years as the scapegoat have been troubling me this evening.  I know it feels lonely, I'm glad you remembered we're here though, it's painful but you made it through another night and I'm proud of you."

offmychest,epu0eys,t1_ept806m,1559501270.0,I'm glad someone understands.  I've had the same thought about having kids honestly.  I hope you're hanging in there better than I am.

offmychest,eptfqbm,t1_epsyvvo,1559489244.0,"Unfortunately in America complete eye transplants aren't a thing yet.  Certain parts of the front of the eye are transplantable, your cornea, your lens, maybe even iris now but the part of my eye that's failing is the retina which is in the very back and is directly connected to the optic nerve.  I've read they're working on it in other countries but it's one of the few places in the human body with nerves so complicated transplants aren't currently considered feasible or practical.  It sucks cause even the new breakthroughs are still unattainable for most.  The gap between cutting edge medicine and what the average person has access to and can afford is ridiculously huge."
raisedbynarcissists,epsr3hp,t3_bvv1fx,1559461518.0,"Furious, yet validated.  This sounds conflicting.  I hope if this is your reality you're doing ok."
survivorsofabuse,epspd8q,t3_bvuqg6,1559458846.0,I'd say desensitized may be the term you're looking for.  My guess is it took a lot of time and pain for him to react the way he does.  It's hard to tell if it's because he's made peace with it or is suppressing his feelings on it.
