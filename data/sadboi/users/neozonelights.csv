BPD,fqyie25,t3_glj9nd,1589749072.0,"A lot of BPD in people is caused by emotionally immature parenting like you described. Dysfunctional family environments as well, which goes hand in hand with the former. People underestimate how this can negatively impact children if there is no sign of physical abuse involved. It's invisible to outside perspectives. Or people do not understand that what may be bearable for adults to handle is not in children, especially from parents or other important adult figures. Maybe some people can handle their boss yelling at them at work and being a passive aggressive dick, but developing children would not be left without some sort of serious emotional scarring if it comes from their parents or teachers who are supposed to support them and help them develop healthy emotional relational skills. Children can't do that if that's what they're constantly going through, even if physical abuse isn't involved. All children are very fragile emotionally. They are not like healthy adults who on one hand may have the perseverance through certain difficulties in interpersonal relationships. Children do not and aren't wired that way at all. They learn from adults. If adults aren't healthy and are negative, that's what they learn instead. My own family is riddled with addiction and passed down unhealed traumas, but no one talks about it. It's ""normal"" for my family. Outsiders would only see loving parents, not parents riddled with problems and emotional immaturities. My father did hit me growing up but only until I was towards the end of my elementary schooling years. No one would know, though. I have a serious complicated relationship with him and my mother for other reasons. She has some childhood trauma and it has made her emotional immaturity come out in inattentive parenting. She ignores me and my siblings and sometimes misinterprets our tones or voices when we are speaking to her. While I do like hanging out with her and am living with her currently, the way she doesn't hear anybody is quite hurtful. Sometimes it's like she has too much of her own baggage to pay attention to me and now that I'm technically an adult now, it seems that she doesn't want to think I ever needed her, even as a teenager.

 I think it's also seeing your parents have friends who wouldn't even reflect or see on the inside how your parents have problems, it creates a lot of doubt and for others to not see anything wrong. I also think people compare what adults can handle without serious damage as the bar for what developing children can handle. Adults can't handle physical abuse, so they without question understand that children can't either. But they don't get that there are other aspects to what children can't handle emotionally in their relationships with caregivers that adults can handle perfectly in other adult relationships."
BPD,fqw1plm,t3_gl7eb6,1589690441.0,"Your family sounds dysfunctional. Dysfunctional family dynamics play a large role in BPD development. And it sounds like you didn't have a supportive schooling environment outside. That is a large role and risk factor that likely contributed. BPD doesn't have to ""run"" in families for you to be put at risk for it. Prolonged abuse, dysfunctional families, emotionally immature parents, and even dysfunctional siblings can put someone at risk and I'm sure an unsupportive community like what you dealt with at school can as well. Your brother sounds like he has some serious behavioral disorder or aspd. You technically have been around close family members with mental illness and most addiction is accompanied by some mental illness and some of the instances with your brother doesn't sound like someone who is mentally healthy. And people do not turn to alcohol and drugs for no reason. My own family doesn't necessarily have BPD in specific ""run"" in it, but addiction and intergenerational trauma run in it. None of which are even healthy for a children to be around. I don't know what you read or heard from someone, but your upbringing as you described sounds very rough. It would validly put you at risk for mental health problems."
BlackMentalHealth,fqvmuk7,t3_gl5euz,1589680622.0,"I'd like a black or mixed race therapist, but where I live, I cannot really be picky. I deal with bpd, cptsd, an eating disorder, depression related problems, and dissociation. Due to the serious impairment these issues create in my life, I just have to settle with whatever intensive treatment fits. Not a lot of therapists of color are even around that do DBT or trauma related therapies. So I get with who understands the specific mental health struggles I deal with. Kinda just had to accept that I won't find a therapist who will understand me culturally, but understand at least how to make my problems more manageable."

BPD,fque3dr,t3_gkn8yz,1589657214.0,"You can love having BPD. I'm unsure what you interpret in your S/O's voice or tone is signifying that she doesn't actually love you or not. BPD creates complicated attachment problems, but feeling love is not necessarily impossible. And depending on someone's background especially if childhood trauma is involved, that may complicate further how they healthily relate to others. I never knew of a healthy functioning family and it has come out in how I form romantic attachments. But I can love, it's just that I have a lot of problems in handling relationships. Then everyone also has different ways of showing love and people feel loved differently from one another. She may be splitting, splitting is not always obvious. Not everyone with BPD has outbursts when they are splitting, it can be a quiet approach of opposing thoughts and feelings about someone or something that may make you feel doubtful and uncertain. Maybe dissociation, I don't know. I dissociate a lot and can become quite detached from people and everything around me and come off as flat and absent when I express myself. Sometimes it makes me lack empathy and not react appropriately in some situations. Ask her how she's feeling perhaps. Don't try to accuse her, just listen to how she feels as calmly as you can if you're confident she won't get upset by asking certain things."
BPD,fqucbly,t3_gklr8y,1589656208.0,"You can't make people believe other than what they choose to believe.

They are talking out of frustration and anger, so naturally they are going to piece out that the hurt or feelings they are feel were intentionally inflicted and that they were targeted. On the other hand, there are well written informational books and websites out there that help people who don't have bpd learn more about the disorder with a clinical sense of understanding.

BPD,fqu9oxp,t3_gkt3q6,1589654743.0,"It sounds like his therapist doesn't understand BPD behaviors beyond that you're doing everything and feeling low out of malice and control. The therapist isn't putting the best ideas in your bf's head on how to support you. There are ways he can help you without giving up his entire life and that therapist is literally no help and miscontructing everything you do as trying to hurt him on purpose. This will only make your relationship pretty unworkable if your bf has no proper understanding of what you're going through and how you are hurting. Take yourself to the ER or call the suicide hotline for support. Maybe try to find some professional help for BPD any way you can. Though in my opinion, it only sounds like the relationship you do have with your bf will continue to be painful if his therapist is only placing stigmatizing beliefs in his head about you. I would recommend preparing to move on from the relationship as a whole."

They're not bad, I just get angry for no reason these days. I almost wonder if it's bpd or cptsd since it's not in correlation to interpersonal reactivity. Or something else, I'm not sure. But I've been struggling with that a whole lot. I don't really have a lot of outbursts unless a situation gets stressful, like there are arguments and such.

However, cluster b pds do overlap and I'm not surprised that there are people with BPD who have prominent HPD traits and features. BPD does look different in everyone and is highly comorbid with a variety of different conditions which can influence symptom expressions."
BPD,fqnl9rr,t3_gjqkhp,1589496888.0,"It depends on the person. I still have presents from people I don't talk to anymore. We drifted apart and it  has less to do with me having BPD. They're busy and they've moved out of our city. I still have her necklace she gave me for my birthday. We just simply don't talk to each other as much anymore. Come to accept that we have different directions in life. She's a person and doesn't just mean nothing anymore due to circumstances out of both our control. I keep her presents because a gifts a gift. I think it is more common for me to part ways with others due to attachment issue struggles, not because they're just garbage to me one day. BPD is black and white, but there are a lot more explanations for why relationships can drift apart than just that. Everyone is different, so they have their own reasons."
BPD,fqk9glp,t3_giqd2a,1589422738.0,"Like a couple people here have already said, there's no concrete measure to abuse in correlation to these symptoms and how people with bpd have different ways of coping and going about them, but it's also not impossible to behave in toxic ways. It is less about being born ""evil"" but more mirroring environments or situations you endured in childhood. That leaves potentiality for behaving ways that may hurt others, you have to just be more self aware and mindful of your actions. Actions matter a lot where bpd symptoms are concerned in managing them and how you behave towards others. DBT is helpful in maneuvering interpersonal settings and coping with your emotions. There is dbtselfhelp which I've used because I can't currently access therapy ever since covid-19 broke out. The online self help stuff is helpful if you can't access therapy."
BPD,fqioamn,t3_gj4qdf,1589398662.0,"Someone with good judgement knows not to take everything on the internet about a complex disorder as facts and do better research to understand it. My own mother is a therapist and she does not believe bpd means you can't love. Everyone including those with bpd have different and unique ways of expressing their affection towards people they care about, there is nothing spookily different about whether people with bpd love than normal people who express their love differently. And those people have had failed relationships and they are definitely angry and resentful. But personal experiences are not  reflective of facts in regards to a disorder that has never been proven to affect whether or not you can love. Another complication to this is armchair psychology surrounding bpd. Many people who've had difficult relationships with others use the disorder as a catch call explanation for why the relationship failed rather than accepting that it just didn't work. The culture around bpd to just diagnose it in people is really messy due to that it is very hard to distinguish bpd from other mental illnesses which can have their own fair share of providing difficulties in relationships. And I think the ""you can't fix someone with bpd"" rhetoric is true and is more directed towards codependent people who seek people out to ""fix"" them with unconditional love only to be faced with the lesson over and over again that only professional help can fix a person with bpd and it isn't their job to do that. Support, understanding, and boundaries is the better message instead of the notion that if you can't ""fix"" people,  a relationship is impossible. Of course there are reasonable situations where someone with bpd is in denial and refuses to get help and understand their disorder which does make relationships frustrating and not doable. And physical abuse is a good reason enough if that is also an occurrence. Not everyone should feel they are obligated to stay, too. But I don't think it's the right message to completely ditch someone because of this when there are possibilities to make the relationship work for both parties involved."
BPD,fqg8far,t3_gimqx3,1589340214.0,"People think you can never have self awareness or care enough if you have BPD. Glad he can point to studies, not people's personal stories with someone they thought had bpd or whatever is all over the internet. The internet is very biased, because people have been through failed relationships and are resentful or angry. Those are valid emotions, but emotions are not factual. Studies prove that many with BPD can improve under the same conditions as anyone dealing with a substance abuse disorder or any other mental illness; the person has to be committed to the work and choose to actively work on themselves. People with BPD are also commonly seeking out mental health services. The one barrier to treatment is that not every therapist is well versed in treating BPD. Some people with BPD get with therapists who do not understand how to help them and easily lose hope. That is one problem and it's also another issue of self awareness, but a good number of people with BPD will accept the right help when offered it. The internet will have a lot of armchair psychology spread about BPD, so that's another problem with misinformation as well. Some people have way too many 'BPD' exes. It's become the diagnosis for when someone has too many codependent or failed relationships. Those people will project their negative experiences as facts about this disorder and treatments."
BPD,fqfdkuv,t3_giku1l,1589323004.0,"I have the same exact problem to think things like how others feel relates to me or something I did when it doesn't. Bpd can cause that problem, it doesn't mean you are inherently a bad person though. I've found DBT quite helpful in better understanding and interpreting the feelings and intentions of others without inserting myself into it in ways that are not helpful to myself or them."
BPD,fqcziwe,t3_gi62i8,1589274352.0,"Depends on comorbidity. Bpd rarely happens alone. You're never with someone who just has bpd. Bpd co-occurs with major depression, ocd, ptsd/cptsd, eating disorders, dissociative disorders, bipolar, substance abuse, and even other personality disorders like npd or aspd. The comorbid disorders affect symptomatic expression of bpd, which is why it even is that people tend to express different combinations of the 5/9 symptoms. But core characteristics are unstable relationships. The comorbid disorders add a lot of uniqueness to how that can look. I have both bpd and complex ptsd. Complex ptsd already negatively impacts my ability to form close relationships. Bpd does as well, making me see everything in black and white. So my opinions and feelings around things and people may shift. I'll give my personal input on this regarding my experiences with bpd and other problems I have:

On a personal level as someone with bpd, I would say as I am currently, I would not be able to hold down a long term healthy relationship right now. I have long strides to go in treating both cptsd and bpd and covid-19 has complicated getting help. 

As for what the internet says, you have got to be mindful of what you're reading about bpd out there. Not all of it is necessarily true. Especially on reddit. People talking from places of anger and resentment are not reflective of facts. And that isn't to say that it isn't factual that bpd impairs healthy relationships, but when people who've gone through failed relationships with someone who has or they think has it (and armchair diagnosis happens on reddit a lot so do question especially since bpd is confused a lot for other mental illnesses like npd) claim that it's impossible, it's reflective of their own circumstances with that person, not the majority of people with bpd who have gone through successful treatment. Successful treatment and bpd DOES cover relationships because unstable relationships is the driving core of the disorder as a direct result of symptoms. Out of the 5/9 criteria, unstable relationships, unstable sense of self, and dysregulated moods are considered core characteristics of bpd. So the relationship aspects should be covered by treatment geared for bpd. I'm not sure what you've read on the internet says anything about that or if it ignores that. In the DBT program I started, there was a focus on interpersonal smartness and effectiveness. DBT is coined as a highly successful treatment. There are conditions that are to be met; someone with bpd must be engaged and actively willing to put that treatment to use even outside of therapy for it to be beneficial. So when I am feeling jealous, I will look up DBT self help and judge whether or not my jealousy is justified. And if I feel it's a problem worth addressing, I can use DEARMAN to healthily communicate my concerns without jumping into conclusions or quarrel. I think for a lot of the stories I've seen on the internet involving treatment complications, the pwbpd is in denial and not coming into terms with the fact that they need help or they have gone through so many of the incorrect treatments and misdiagnosed with conditions they don't have, they have lost faith in getting help. But even getting help for bpd is hard because not every therapist understands how to treat it or holds outdated beliefs that nothing can be done to help. You see this on the internet passed around, too. Or DBT at least in America where I live can cost a lot of money. So there are certain barriers worth mentioning in regards to treatment seeking that I often seen ignored on the internet and concluded that pwbpd simply don't care. Seeking treatment for bpd has to be specific and very particular because not every therapy helps it. Someone with bpd doing CBT and taking meds prescribed doesn't actually count as treatment. To someone who doesn't have bpd, it may, but it's the wrong treatments. Only certain therapies can help for bpd and meds don't have much effect unless prescribed alongside evidence backed treatments like DBT. If someone with bpd has comorbid conditions like bipolar, meds would indefinitely be part of treatment but mainly to address the bipolar not the bpd part."
BPD,fqb5i1k,t3_gho9yq,1589230930.0,"I have really skewered attachment, so I do often bail on relationships from platonic to romantic. I think being close to someone makes me really scared as much as I crave relationships to not feel alone. I don't think about it, but I always think of how wrong things could go. Or sometimes I was just finding myself obsessed with people and then lose the spark...it's really hard to describe. But it's not something I do because I get a kick out of it before people think I go out of my way to play with other people's feelings or waste their time. It's super complicated and likely due to CPTSD layered on top of BPD for me. I feel very despondent about not being able to hold close relationships. Even where I was at one point highly confident about the relationship. The fear takes over and ruins everything. To the other person, it's confusing how I dip out of their life."

Sometimes you can't diffientriate what is the illness being exacerbated and what is genuine worry about places and people. But many other Asian-Americans have become increasingly targeted throughout this pandemic and singled out, so you aren't alone in feeling terrified. I think the safest option for you would be to consider moving neighborhoods. Try to find places where other Asian people populate and you will feel more comfortable. The most positive things in the world to me is to surround yourself with people who share your same experiences. I've found more positivity in the world by relating to others like me from interests and hobbies to world experiences. Where I live, the majority of people luckily take the pandemic seriously and do what they can to help neighbors and workers who have to go out during the pandemic. There is still the fair share of people who don't take it seriously, but I believe they are a minority."
BPD,fqawwal,t3_ghijsr,1589226684.0,"I know you covered comorbid disorders, but talk about Complex PTSD if you didn't and how both CPTSD and BPD can be rooted in childhood factors. How CPTSD has it's own highly unique expression mistaken as other personality disorders if not BPD itself, but how it is entirely possible to have both BPD and CPTSD. Always thought I met the criteria for other personality disorders than just BPD until I did more research into my recent PTSD diagnosis which can honestly be best covered as CPTSD in specific. There are four categories of trauma responses coined to CPTSD called ""Fight"", ""Flight"", ""Freeze"", ""Fawn"". Some of it can be confused with BPD. I think it'd be interesting to discuss how many people with BPD meet the criteria for CPTSD."
BPD,fq8xh07,t3_ghhyls,1589178457.0,"Well firstly, no one here can read your sister's mind just because she has the same illness as people here. Don't know why she is obsessed with getting you guys in legal trouble or what the aim is at all. But I can advise that you fight to have your other sister's record cleared of this false allegation. You'll need to get yourself legally involved to combat false allegations. Your sister with BPD doesn't even have to have the upper hand here in lying and making shit up especially where it involves many of you who can be witnesses to easily dispute her lies. Plus if she's mentally unstable, that can also be used against her. She has a clear record of attempts against her own life. That can easily pose question into court that not all of her stories even happened in the first place. I know that itself sounds bad to use her mental health against her, but you guys are left with no choice if she's doing this. Record stuff. If she's even having at it with your personal property, be taking pictures of your stuff in tact and call the police on her if she expresses will to commit suicide. At that point, taking these problems to court may be the only way for her to stop lying all the time and trying to get you all in troube. 

I also don't know the clear dynamics of your family, but a lot of people with BPD come from backwards families. At least I do, so I don't know what type of dynamics are involved here. My family is a mess of unhealed trauma and addictions. Most people with BPD aren't out to intentionally ruin people's lives to gain anything. Most times, I'm more likely to be in legal trouble than getting others in it. So my experience with legal business is pretty different. That's me, and everyone with BPD has pretty different experiences there that aren't cookie cutter like mine or your sister's, so I would avoid the generalizations of ""why do people with BPD do X action that isn't exclusive of someone having BPD"". I'm not sure. People with NPD may do something like this but motives are clearly different than someone who has delusional disorder falsely accusing family members of some serious crime. All I can say is that there is a decision your family can make. Your sister needs to get treatment or you guys can also just cut her off. Even as mentally fragile as she is, there are boundaries you need to set. I think not allowing destructive lies is fair enough of a limit she needs to respect not to cross just because she's angry at you guys. She either respects that and gets treatment or she faces the consequences of those destructive lies: that can be estrangement from her family or her own self getting into legal trouble for making up false allegations."

BPD,fq8ohv1,t3_ghfeku,1589171186.0,"All I know is that HPD makes people ultra attention seeking, a core characteristic of the disorder commonly confused as BPD. People with BPD only care most about attention from people we've developed close feelings with. Those with HPD want an audience and seek out scenarios that are exciting and are easily frustrated and bored. They don't care about receiving negative attention which is what diffientriates it from the attention seeking tendencies of people with NPD who care what type of attention they are receiving in comparison. Those with HPD also experience shallow emotions and constantly change moods. A lot of it overlaps so much between NPD and BPD. They're just very attention seeking and HPD is commonly associated with factitious disorders like munchausens for the attention based reasons, another connection confused with BPD all the time.

Can't say it's necessarily a BPD thing, but a lot of us have all sorts of other problems that may be cover what you described. For me, it's due to CPTSD and depersonalization/derealization."
BPD,fq8i1oh,t3_gh9wy0,1589166673.0,"I struggle with empathy, too. Almost wondered if bpd was a correct diagnosis if I'm not falling over from having too much empathy. I wish that notion also matched the history of my relationships towards other people, too. Thing is, if I did have too much empathy, I would likely run into less of the interpersonal trouble my mental health causes. It's more so half the time compromised or mishandled empathy. For example, hypervigilance is something I've seen shared between ptsd/cptsd and bpd. A lot of people mistake monitoring other people's moods as empathy when it's often a survival mechanism growing up around moody or volatile caregivers who were unpredictable. For me, I can experience that emotional aspect of feeling dread when people are experiencing negative emotions. Not out of caring, but to determine whether I should avoid them and them possibly taking their mood out on me. Or I feel annoyed or irritable when people experience negative emotions. Frustrated, even. I don't act out towards them cruelly, but it can definitely be conflicting on how I respond in a way that benefits them. It can make relationships feel a little less connected. I also have cptsd and dissociate a lot, so I am also very emotionally detached at the same time. I think people here deny that you can have issues with empathy and have bpd because they think of npd or aspd which have very distinctive empathy issues from bpd. It's interesting though, because personality disorders aren't even the only things that can cause issues around empathy. But I guess society really has a misconstructed notion of empathy that is either you're a serial killer or a person capable of love and care and bpd is already very stigmatized. To acknowledge empathy as something that can possibly be a problem will have people easily comparing those with bpd to narcissists or psychopaths which the bpd community actively tries to avoid being compared to. But empathy issues does not mean you can't love or care. I mean, it looks different depending on why those empathy issues are present. It can range from autism to aspd to other problems like dissociative disorders which all don't have the same reasons for that problem. I think people don't understand that part is the reason for empathy issues is highly different and you don't need to be a serial killer or whatever."
BPD,fq7psls,t3_gh36hu,1589149751.0,"I think in part, gaslighting that isn't intentional from families come from a lot of emotionally immature parenting involved where significant physical abuse is absent. Emotionally immature parenting poses a risk factor in developing BPD. But it can also not be obvious if physical abuse is again, absent. It goes undetected as something that can be negatively impactful on a child growing up. So there has to be some argument about genetics or whatever. Even BPD being ""passed down"" is better explained by parents who aren't managing their own BPD mirroring the unhealthy maladaptive coping mechanisms and world views to their child who is like a sponge to their parent's example and is more at risk to develop the disorder due to that. 

For me, my family is dysfunctional and not a lot of significant physical abuse happened. Except my dad did hit my siblings and I growing up but stopped when I reached my late elementary school years. Plus being mixed black and exposed to racial violence growing up, but having a family who were otherwise not super physically abusive towards me as a child has had me downplaying things because of the nature of BPD making me irrational and overly reactive at times. Then there is a lot of unhealed trauma and intergenerational trauma and such mingled in with some of the experiences of unintentionally being gaslighted. Parentification, parents projecting their unhealed traumas, parental alienation, have all had components of gaslighting involved. But the absence of serious physical abuse also sparks the doubt and then BPD's nature combined is what makes me gaslight my own upbringing a lot. Recently before covid-19 closed everything and I bailed on therapy, my therapist diagnosed me with ptsd or complex ptsd, and I downplayed my experiences because I'm also getting treatment for BPD and believed that things couldn't have been bad if my family never attacked me. I thought it's impossible because I ""always overreact"" and it is my fault for being the ""angry"" person my family insisted I was. But for that context, I was shy and quiet growing up and prone to anxiety more so than an angry temperament that wasn't normal or unusual for my age. My oldest sister negatively affected and sort of more severely parentified by both parents than I was mainly from our dad, would lash out at me growing up and gaslighted me. She'd say things never happened or she never said something when she'd name call and put me down. But she didn't lay a finger on me. There's also a 5 year difference between us and to this day now that we're both adults, she is sorry for some of those behaviors and remorseful. I strongly believe that BPD development is a risk factor in family dynamics where gaslighting is involved in caregiver and even sibling relationships. Hope my input on this made sense, I started going on about my own life examples which all may not have fallen under the definition of being gaslit."

I think I've tried to express a similar concern here before but I don't believe I've articulated it as well as you have. I myself have come to recognize that a lot of the time, there are moments where my empathy is not completely nonexistent, but skewered somehow. I've never therefore related to all these attributes of bpd making me an ""empath"". It's positive, but does it really fit the reality of my experience with bpd? Not really. Sometimes it's made me wonder about comorbidities like npd or aspd before even. But I've never necessarily come off as callous, arrogant, or coldy uncaring to the people closest to me. But comorbidities and bpd are highly important in regards to empathy which is where I definitely agree with you that it does feel counterproductive when bpd is seen as cookie cutter there. 

Also, bpd rarely happens alone and the majority of the time, comorbid illnesses shape how it's expressed differently in different people. For me, I've come to realize how complex ptsd itself can make me recoil from close or intimate relationships. I can get very biased towards what I perceive to be negative evaluation from someone and I'm not always correct half the time. But I genuinely believe those feelings and end up either getting mad at people or isolating myself and withdrawing from relationships completely. They don't understand and then my irrational mind tells me, ""well, I shouldn't have to spell things out for them, they should know why I'm acting/feeling this way!!"" And it's my irrational logic there that is unfair because I have learned not to be able to properly communicate my concerns with other people due to my past childhood upbringing. When people do push this empath agenda with bpd, it encourages me to not evaluate whether or not the feelings I'm picking up are correct or even justified. I've found DBT has been a helpful tool before I just make conclusions about things based on feelings. Then there are other instances where I am experiencing a lot of dissociation and it can make me very detached from situations around me where I should be empathetic. I've also gotten into situations where my own poor boundaries got me used by people I felt plenty of what I thought was empathy for them and I've gravitated to relationships simply because I don't like being alone. I've come to recognize bpd as a set of coping mechanisms I adopted in situations growing up but do not serve me any longer. I'm not bad or good for having them. It is manageable. Having these issues do not define me. Good and bad are what I do and every human being may find themselves there, not just me as someone with bpd. I think your examples of different empathetic responses really resonate with my own experiences. And it makes sense because I've met so many other people with bpd who's expressions are shaped by comorbid illnesses or circumstances."
BPD,fq2gs94,t1_fpyi13w,1589055995.0,"You don't need to act full blown abusive. There's a lot more nuance into the symptoms than just abuse. Y'all have to make this disorder so black and white, which is ironic. Bpd can cause relationship difficulties, that is considered characteristic and that can range from a lot than just acting abusive. The reason it's a personality disorder is because the symptoms stem from what is called maladaptive coping mechanisms. Not a chemical imbalance. That's literally what makes it different from other mental illnesses and it's mostly about upbringing and childhood temperament groomed by caregivers and other adult figures. It also rarely occurs alone and has a lot of comorbid disorders like bipolar, ptsd, eating disorders, ocd, etc.  So in essence, there's a lot more into play with bpd than just being an abusive person or a good person. It's not black and white."
BPD,fpxk3em,t3_gg4gkm,1588984090.0,"I think I get what you mean. It does seem hard to be critical of some of what is presented as ""positivity"" here without being treated like you're launching a personal attack on someone or trying to be negative for the sake of being negative. I think people think that being critical of pinning so much positivity to the disorder means that you're saying that they are a bad person because there's been this common trend lately where people over identify with having the disorder. You were nice to someone you love because you have bpd, not because you are someone who cares about that person. You were polite to the store clerk because you have bpd or whatever. Somehow so much of what are not actions necessarily tied to having the disorder are pinned and identified into it. To the point where people do seem to have forgotten that while it's an illness, not everything you do is because of it. And definitely, what is considered an illness is an illness due to negative behaviors, thoughts, and feelings that bring significant distress to your life. Bpd is considered an illness exactly due to that very definition. 

I think people feel the need to ascribe positive things to it because they don't actually believe that they can have positive qualities while having the disorder. When you can. I can love my sister while having it, but honestly, I do not thank bpd for the disruptions in our relationship it causes and the excessive insecurities it brings me. My sister doesn't enjoy seeing me miserable due to it, either. She sees me for having positive qualities while having bpd, but not because of it like the way people have been framing it lately in this sub. I'll be honest and agree with you, it hasn't helped me very much to think I have goodness directly due to having an illness. I have unhealthy coping mechanisms, but they don't define me and I can still be a good person proven through the actions I commit to. Goodness is what you do, not what you are. At least that is how I see it. So an illness can't just be what I base my good actions off of. I think it's also unhealthy that people see goodness as what you are because that's how a lot of narcissistic people think. My dad is a great example of that and I have found myself almost stumbling into his mindset if I don't check myself.

*edit* 

after looking at later comments, I'll elaborate on what I mean by my opinion. I'm not saying everyone should just collectively be miserable. I just think that some of the positive attributes I've seen attached to bpd should be examined, because I've seen how some of it can lead to people remaining stuck in unhealthy thinking patterns and emotions. Like codependent led behaviors is a great example that can definitely be tied to bpd. Codependency seems prosocial, but it is unhealthy and detrimental to relationships. Some people have felt that it isn't unhealthy to feel responsible for the well being  of others all the time. Not on purpose, but because they aren't aware that it isn't actually healthy. Because it seems prosocial, but it's also a lack of boundaries which hurts them. Another issue I have seen is people not acknowledging how bpd can make people misinterpret other people a lot...I think in terms of reading people, there should be more awareness and tips on how to handle that. I think more resources on healthy coping mechanisms and recovery stories would be better to see than some of the misframed positivity. This disorder is very treatable and my view on it as something separate from me, rather than what I am, is how I cope best and acknowledge where it makes me slip up. Not saying everyone needs to agree, but I just think it is important to be a little more constructively critical about what is posted here, positive or negative. I don't think positive posts should be deleted either. But I think it is important to reflect on what is being said nonetheless. Sometimes it can be difficult to discuss this here because people will think you're trying to tear them down for thinking differently."
BPD,fpxeurv,t1_fpxc577,1588981326.0,"Sounds like a drug abuse related issue, not necessarily just bpd involved."
BPD,fpwlyy9,t3_gfw5cu,1588965800.0,"That splitting means that I'm going to burn someone's house down and that I'll remain split black forever. Bpd makes me vacillate between black and white states of thinking, not remain constructively stuck on one view forever. My opinion on myself and other people don't remain forever the same for sure, but I bounce back and forth between positive and negative opinions in all honesty. 

Another with bpd is that I'm going to unravel over everything. I have very particular triggers, and everyone with bpd has different things that either set them off or don't. It will always involve some type of social situation, too. People picture bpd and imagine you all over the place with emotions just anywhere which isn't exactly how it works at all. And the worst stereotype is that it makes you a serial cheater or someone who is incapable of genuine love and affection towards others. And people attributing every negative or annoying thing in someone and armchair diagnosing them with bpd."
BPD,fpsm98i,t3_gf61ey,1588875856.0,This was good to read. I think I'll try something similar with my own family. Been home with them throughout quarantine and I've struggled with splitting a lot as well. I was just discussing my symptoms with my sister the other day after I got triggered by something our mom did and I think it'd be important for her to know when this is happening and what it looks like since I spend the most time with her out of anyone.
BPD,fppgtwr,t3_gendb2,1588802015.0,"It is a mental illness. There are a lot of debates on it not being one because it's a personality disorder, which while is a type of mental illness, there are people out there who believe people with personality disorders choose to act the way they do or think and feel the way they do and are therefore not suffering. Lots of professionals think especially those with bpd are choosing to be the way they are and so we obviously aren't suffering, but making it up for some twisted attention seeking motive. That psychologist is wrong. This is a serious disorder with a high suicide rate because it is people like them thinking these types of things which directly affect the care people with bpd receive in professional mental health care settings. Honestly unacceptable, given the research surrounding bpd these days. Not every professional is trained to diagnose or treat bpd, so they may parrot misinformed views about it.

As for youtubers, a lot of them do wild things to garner views for their channel. Lots of them are problematic, but I think it's ridiculous to pinpoint personality disorders all on why this is the way youtubers set their platform the way they do these days. Armchair psychology has been more popular than ever, so I guess people will reach for their dsm because it's an easy go to explain weird or problematic behaviors without actually analyzing things from a more nuanced perspective."
BPD,fpilrlz,t3_gdnzat,1588643555.0,"If she's traumatized as you stated and has difficult relationships with her own family, then that was a giant red flag there that she is not going to be very functional in relationships with other people outside. I can't pinpoint all the crazy behaviors of her solely to bpd because even many with people with bpd have a lot of comorbidities of other conditions that can influence symptoms and behaviors. Most people with bpd rarely have bpd alone. I don't know what you've read on forums, but a lot of people without bpd do not pay attention to how comorbid conditions influence the behaviors as well. They all attribute every bizarre behavior to bpd solely. If you want to understand why someone acts the way they do, especially where bpd is concerned, the high comorbidity with other conditions explains a lot. I think her relationship with her family also has role in how she may have behaved towards you. 

However, it is best you move on from her and come to understand this relationship as a reason more to ditch the codependent geared thinking of giving so much away to someone especially where it is evident they can't give much back for whatever reason. And the fact that you moved away, I think it'd have been best to end things there. Obviously she didn't want you to leave and that's where the desperate and frantic behaviors and frustrations came seeping out. She clearly also split on you as well. Bpd leaves no room for object permanence. If you're physically gone, to the person, you are GONE. It's like what a baby thinks when their parent plays peekaboo and hides their face. To the baby, their parent actually disappeared. Then mixed in is a lack of emotional permanence. Bpd creates black and white thinking, so if she begins to feel negatively about you, she doesn't remember the good things she had with you. It is not a choice, so that's where you have to be careful about whatever you've read out there. It is not a choice, but it's how your brain may unhealthily develop due to certain circumstances during childhood growing up. That's the reason behind what drove her actions, but of course doesn't excuse the abuse like denying you your own emotions and not respecting your needs and boundaries. I'll just point out that bpd can impair empathy in that way when the abandonment fears are set in. It's also a great mix of being incapable to hold healthy attachments with others more so than plain malice. That's what I can say drove the situations where your relationship with her fell apart. As for the other stuff, like the sexual assault...I honestly can't say that it's bpd, but maybe other fucked up issues driving her thinking there. My advice is to not talk to her at all anymore. You can't save her, she needs to be an adult and manage her own mental health. Bpd can create dependence on others, so I would encourage you as someone without it to not enable that dependency by worrying about taking care of yourself. And move on from her because that other part is really fucked up and nasty."
BPD,fphqkr6,t3_gd3cpj,1588625986.0,"I know it's not right of me to snoop through your past posts, but it looks like you're just a teenager and I don't bring that up to dismiss your post. But I think it is important to note for others looking at this post here before they form a complete opinion on what you've just shared. I am not doubting that you've been around toxic people, but given you mention friends or partners and you're young, I would refrain from labeling them with bpd. Your peers are not old enough for a bpd diagnosis where it can be explained by other mental illnesses and such or general teenager behaviors (middle-high school relationships can suck). This is no doubt that your relationships with them were toxic. As for family members, I'm not necessarily casting any doubt because many people have grown up around adults who may have bpd and it can be overwhelming to handle understandably. I would strongly encourage therapy to work through these past relationships and learn to set healthy boundaries so that other people in the future do not tread on them."

BPD,fpam6er,t3_gcafyy,1588451028.0,"Yes, this is important. Another thing is thinking you're evil and irredeemable, which does nothing to correct things with the other person and it can look like a pity party for yourself instead. To the other person, it may make them feel compelled to comfort you for being upset for hurting them, too. I think a great lesson with bpd is to not think just because you're capable of remorse and guilt means that it's automatically helpful in relationships. Sometimes bpd creates a tendency to instead wallow in those feelings which is unproductive for changing actions and properly apologizing."
BPD,fp7mdwz,t3_gbqe37,1588373377.0,"No. There is good support for bpd symptoms out there. It is so far the most treatable cluster b pd and most treatable pd overall for the most part.

BPD,fp406qz,t3_gauj6z,1588289118.0,"I have comorbid avpd traits, an eating disorder, and serious dissociative symptoms. Comorbid avpd traits makes me care so much about what other people think about me, so it fuels more defensiveness from bpd symptoms or makes me either very withdrawn and reserved. It can also make me more passive about things. Like bpd, it deals with abandonment and negative biases towards other people's motives or how they may or may not feel about you. I'll spend more time alone to avoid having to deal with abandonment. But at the same time, it is an opposing coping mechanism that also backfires since being alone for me is too much to handle at the same time. My relationships end up not being very fulfilling. Too much intimacy is hard to handle. For both disorders. Then I also need to be involved with someone to feel validated. But I also don't want to deal with rejection or humiliation at the same time. I'm also more careful I'm involved with people who seem to like me enough or are emotionally unavailable so I don't care if they leave. It's really hard to deal with the negative self image from this comorbity and the way it impacts how I approach relationships."
BPD,fp3ndvx,t3_garanb,1588282372.0,"Tbh these are the same people who actually don't realize by denying they are capable of hurting others as a result of symptoms who make normal people also believe we are self victimizing. A lot of people like this on this sub convince themselves that bpd is a harmless disorder like a personality disorder diagnosis in general doesn't warrant that you'll exhibit problematic behaviors in relationships on some scale. It doesn't have to negate full blown abuser behaviors, but even behaviors that would come off as intensely dramatic or bizarrely erratic to a normal person and be confusing as hell. To even ourselves, it is confusing. Not to mention, bpd rarely occurs alone. Other mental illnesses can complicate symptoms whether that's psychotic, mood, anxiety, eating, dissociative, or other personality disorders. I have comorbid avpd traits and an eating disorder. I also struggle a lot with dissociative symptoms. These other co-occuring issues themselves complicate my bpd expression. In many ways, they can work to aggravate those symptoms. It's why I stopped bothering to identify with this classic-quiet bpd discourse; comorbities are really the true influencers on how bpd symptoms are expressed. 

And while bpd alone doesn't create the tendency to want to hurt others, you indirectly may do so from some of the symptoms associated. Indirectly negatively affecting others is not any better, either. We just have to acknowledge that we can do that and it isn't celebrating it; it is a crucial step in self awareness part of managing symptoms. People focus way too much on the ""but I don't intend to hurt people"" part; which IS true of bpd. But it doesn't matter to the receiving end of our behaviors. My grandma is part of the reason I have bpd; she has extensive childhood trauma herself. I strongly believe it contributed to her dysfunctional ways. However, even while she is just negatively affected by her unhealthy childhood upbringing, it doesn't mean anything just because she didn't intend to hurt me. She is not sadistic by any nature, either. But still, her actions had impact, negatively intended or not. You don't have to sit down and think, ""today I'll hurt or stress out the people I care about"" to hurt them or negatively impact them. I see a lot of people with bpd here in giant denial of that. It isn't an excuse, but it is part of self awareness in the end. You have to be aware of the negative behaviors of the disorder to work on them. Discussing them is not a celebration. I prefer discussing the ways bpd can be problematic rather than sweeping it under the rug. It isn't to say I'm happy with them; but that I'm aware and am willing to work on healthier ways to cope with symptoms. I think if people here want to discuss the bad symptoms, it is a good step for someone who has done extensive therapy to step in the conversation and share tips in how they managed those symptoms rather than accuse people of celebrating those symptoms. I see borderlines who've gone through DBT act like they never were unhealthy before they decided to get therapy and manage symptoms."
BPD,fp16tcd,t3_gapoe7,1588226035.0,"An ""fp"" is not used clinically, but is used in the online bpd community to describe infatuation or emotional dependence on either people you're close with or people you've just met who you grew infatuated with for them being briefly nice to you. The dynamic of the ""fp"" relationship is also literally just black and white thinking based anyways, which is a core symptom of bpd. Regardless even if those things may resonate put into a less vague description, you don't need to describe your relationships that way. I think personally ""fp"" relationships are aspired to way too much in online bpd circles even though it's an unhealthy way to view and approach relationships."
BPD,fp14hny,t3_gaoaxf,1588224168.0,"Imo I don't think that person was celebrating their behaviors or being accepting of them; they just wanted to see if any other person with bpd struggled with similar behaviors. I also don't think people upvoted their post because they're happy with how they behave. A lot of us with bpd DO hurt others whether we intended to or not. Yes, we too are hurting, but our behaviors and actions have some negative impact on others as well as they do ourselves. Admitting that doesn't make people evil or good...but it is highly important to be honest about the worst symptoms. I think if we go around sugarcoating everything, then we deny opportunity to reflect and correct the erratic tendencies this disorder causes for ourselves and towards others. I have seen this sub do that in attempt to deflect stigma, but I feel it does the opposite and is dishonest. I have found that when I've acknowledged  that I have and can hurt others or be generally mean as a result of issues arising from bpd, I know which problems to attend to. I'm not in therapy, but I do try to monitor myself when I'm in horrible moods. I can get pretty nasty when I'm mad. Or I walk away before I jump to conclusions about how someone's tone came off to me to cool off and talk to them later instead of spontaneously reacting to what I feel. Problem is, bpd makes you react in accordance to your feelings rather than the facts of situations. That is where so many of us screw up and that's part of why we have problems in our relationships. Sure, it hurts me, but I do have to consider how these symptoms directly may also scratch others even if I don't want to. Bpd is a set of maladaptive coping mechanisms typically developed as a response to invalidating or traumatizing situations during childhood. Your entire mindset is based on self preservation to meet needs that didn't get met. In dealing with it, you will accidentally scratch others. I don't think acknowledging the ugly is avoiding accountability. I don't know what to debate on it being a cluster b pd, but it shares some similarities with the other ones even if many of us would like to deny that.

 Personally, I think it would be more productive for people to view symptoms as a gray area...so far I see is that we're not evil or we're evil because xyz... and it does really reflect the black and white nature of discussions surrounding this very complex disorder."

Dismantling antiblackness in society is such a low priority to nonblack people. People really aren't alarmed at how it is a common ""phase"" for nonblack teenagers and youth to hold antiblack views.

BPD,folhgv8,t3_g84q67,1587862320.0,"Bpd creates emotional amnesia. If you're not feeling a past emotion presently, you lack a lot of awareness about that past emotion. Example: feeling suicidal one evening and forgetting how that morning or hours ago, you may have been happy or goal-oriented. Now you can only focus on your present negative feeling that has shifted from the pleasant feelings you once held. It's a subconscious shift, too. Bpd creates highly unpredictable drastic changes in emotions and thoughts about the self and other people. I think that it takes work into treatment for someone with bpd to look back on past relationships and realize that it was more than just negative. There were positive aspects as well, but a black and white mindset in addition to emotional amnesia makes it difficult to focus on gray areas."
BPD,foko95n,t3_g7tkqn,1587845799.0,"You bring up a good point. I think a lot of people think having an ""fp"" is normal and not unhealthy because black and white thinking is a dynamic and attachment bpd creates in relationships. And it is something it's difficult to have immediate awareness of. My bet people don't question it is due to that. I know it's so hard to see people in gray terms that I'm just used to idealizing people and devaluing them when they disappoint me or accidentally trigger me. My awareness levels aren't that great until in hindsight, I see that the way I view my relationships is unhealthy. And it's why I'm not happy with them. I have realized I have to practice seeing the gray areas of people so that it doesn't create this unstable simultaneous vacillation of opposing views of them. And with your aunt with bpd, you're right. Bpd can get you attached to the worst people. Some people who can even be enabling of your own unhealthy behaviors.

Suddenly my diagnosis changing meant she'd have to ""walk on eggshells. "" because when my diagnosis was bipolar 2, she was more open about discussing my mental health. She's also a mental health therapist herself. I also got a feel she was projecting whatever understanding she had of her clients at the time with bpd onto me and thinking that I'd fall apart over everything she does. I don't remember what I'd told her after she claimed she had to walk on eggshells around me, because I would tell her now that she's making it unhelpful for both herself and me to feel responsible for my unpredictable moods. Plus it's so untrue. She wouldn't even notice if I'm in a garbage mood half the time. I was so good at faking a neutral mood and still do. I go to my room to be alone if I'm irritable. The only thing she should ever notice is that I'm distant and then wanting to be around everyone and then distant again and then wanting to be around everyone again. She doesn't even know what triggers me in the first place. I'm more likely to be upset by arguments than plain bad news (like something planned is cancelled or whatever).

But to not be abusive, it is all about monitoring your actions towards other people and admitting mistakes honestly. A functional relationship involves that from both people."
BPD,fnzrlgx,t3_g4th6c,1587399518.0,"I've seen people be all out sympathizing with ""stigma"" until the topic is BPD. Then they say that people with it deserve stigma."
BPD,fnxz8q7,t3_g40cl3,1587349633.0,"A psychiatrist diagnosed me. I had a vague idea that I may have symptoms when I was younger. I didn't think too much of it because I was underage at the time. I thought my erratic behaviors and mood swings were better explained by a previous psychiatrist's misdiagnosis bipolar 2. I was focused more on medicating myself for that diagnosis. Though one thing is, I'd never met the criteria for a hypomanic or manic episode at all. I'd been treated for depression before that and that psychiatrist thought that since zoloft was making me have trouble sleeping, it had to be a hypomanic/manic episode and once after not taking that anymore, I no longer had issues sleeping. However, there have always been remarkable longstanding problems with my thoughts around people in my life and issues with emotional outbursts and rage. I would be constantly suicidal which was quite abnormal for someone young. And those things weren't explainable by bipolar 2. So when the different psychiatrist diagnosed bpd, it made a little more sense. And honestly, my family has heard of bpd before and weren't surprised when I disclosed that to them. My sisters initially already thought I had bpd. They just never told me their secret speculations. Abandonment issues manifest in how I strongly cling to my one sister who I trust. I am also quick to push away other relationships as a result. Basically, it seems I never emotionally matured past 11/12 years old."
BPD,fnxx1qk,t3_g42lqh,1587348188.0,"I also think the annoying trend lately is people armchair diagnosing others and celebrities/famous figures with bpd and acting like experts about it. It's become coded for ""I don't like this person"" or ""annoying person who doesn't make sense to me."""
BPD,fnwkhvp,t3_g4c3ru,1587320117.0,"I'm sorry this happened to you. It isn't your fault. A lot of nursing homes across the country are running rampant with covid-19. It's a stressful period for the elderly especially like your grandpa. Your brother may be reacting strongly do to fear of losing your grandpa. Sometimes grief makes people jerks. Grief can make people burst out unfounded outrageous accusations. You said the right thing to him as far as I would handle the situation. Though it seems he is too upset to be reasonable, so you said what you could to deflect an unjustified accusation against you. Just remind yourself that the attacks he made toward you aren't true and that he has issues that are beyond your control. If he's always had problems empathizing with others and apologizing, it's best to accept that he may not know the depth his words have on others. Try to have space from him if you can."
BPD,fntft53,t3_g3tovn,1587240785.0,"BPD symptoms are characterized by:
*frantic actions to prevent perceived or real abandonment 
*unstable relationships characterized by shifts of black and white thinking 
*emotional dysregulation 
*unstable sense of self
*self destructive behaviors
*impulsivity 
*angry outbursts 
*suicidal behaviors 
*chronic feelings of emptiness

No one here can offer a diagnosis of your mother. Certainly, her behavior is harmful and hurtful towards you. I'm not sure about putting up facades. NPD is known to be more functional than BPD. I've cried in public and gotten into arguments with my loved ones regardless of where we are. I've ended up embarrassing myself with my lack of control over emotions and them before. BPD acts on impulsivity and that includes lack of control over emotions and behaviors which can basically happen anywhere. It's really hard to act stable when triggered. Even when I'm not at home or in private. The impulsivity part has left some with BPD losing jobs due to lack of conduct over emotional reactions. I just think that is important to note that people with BPD aren't that great at faking normality to the degree the internet claims. On the other hand, NPD is a better candidate at hiding dysfunctional behaviors in non private settings. In general, I can't say that untreated BPD will make anyone a great parent. I also can't deny that it may make you critical of others. But those behaviors correlate with specific symptoms I'm not sure you've described as being related with BPD specifically. When splitting, sure you can get critical and bitter. But not all the time. People with BPD will compliment others when we're not struggling with splitting related thinking. Then again, like I disclaimed at the start, I'm not a professional. I don't have authority to verify or disprove anything regarding your mom. I only offer an amateur opinion as someone who happens to have BPD. As for yourself, it is best you set boundaries for yourself and your mom. She has clearly affected your mental health as a result of poorly tending to her own issues. I would say move out or stay away from her, but that's difficult in these current times. Try to find therapeutic tools and resources online geared towards dealing with difficult/unsupportive parents."
BPD,fnr527k,t3_g37o81,1587179478.0,"Yes. It is overwhelming to respond to other people's emotions and needs due to how it is difficult to manage our own. DBT is a saver at approaching situations where negative emotions is not just involving yourself, but other people, too."
