BPDlovedones,fcko8fu,t1_fcjzio7,1577729610.0,"I had an ex who was likely uNPD, something that developed or gradually came to the surface during our time together (we were teenagers and her mum was very psychologically abusive of her and her sibling, it was very confusing to be involved in) and when I finally snipped her from my life many years later, a significant group of people disappeared from my FB friends list.  Very clearly (and not out of character for her) she spread a campaign of bullshit about me and encouraged our mutual friends to disconnect.

And I do not miss those people.  Not even one.  Not even nostalgia.  She did my work for me and I am grateful for that.

Relocation, within reason, to get away from a harmful person can be more reliable than waiting for them to get away, but it might not be feasible for many people.  At the very least, tho, it's worthwhile to lose the in-common friends and start a new thing."

I'm going to read other folks' comments after replying to you, so I apologize for any redundancies.

I am glad she's been put in care.  I am glad she's away from you.  I hope she never comes back to you, but hopefully she goes back to being alone and learning how to deal with that.

You, for your part, must be feeling a range of physical motion you haven't for a while.  It can be a little anxiety inducing, but you'll get used to it.

Do your best to start erecting boundaries to keep yourself safe from any backlash she might try to enact.  And yeah, read up on people in your situation, but not just on Reddit, also in books.

BPDlovedones,fckkxd2,t1_fchddq3,1577727575.0,"I find this frustrating too, particularly because I've found the places where my pwBPD's arguments have weak improv.  Like, lazy ad hominems, wells of old complaints that are clearly years out of date and have since been addressed to satisfaction, weird misplaced fake racial bigotry actually directed at former living situations, insulting my mother (which she wouldn't do in person, cos the insults are fabricated from other people's blogs and she and my mum actually have a pretty smooth relationship), etc, there are more.

So, like, more than half the time she blows up for a few days she's just kindof huffing and puffing a bunch of hot nonsense, but even when I know the insults are flash-in-the-pan, soon-to-be-abandoned, she-doesn't-even-mean-it, and not-actually-connected-to-me, I don't like verbal abuse.  It gets in the way, unnecessarily manipulates tensions, sometimes ruins my day but she's already moved on from it, and wastes time.  

And it's... uh... yeah, it's hurtful that she forgets things we talked about even recently and she just denies them in the air, and she's back to calling me the hard F-word again for... I don't know why?... She has no negative feelings against queer people so why start now?... And I'm straight?...

When she's successful at fugue-stating her emotional dysregulations and general anxt to where she properly gets under my skin, I'm almost impressed.  I'm happy she's getting back to a place where she's synthesizing information in her heated state.  It often signifies that she's come to the root of what's causing the blowup, and she'll express it to me in a calm meaningful way when she's ready, so I just kinda have to collect the gradually accumulating fragments of lucidity so I can be useful in that eventual conversation.

But it's under my skin just right before the healing starts to happen, right?  I dunno.  In line with CCC, I'm not keen on nannying or being a doormat when she gives up or loses control over her mind.  It's just kinda like a tropical storm that's an obstacle to my personal progress."

Many people who are having a hard time with an anxious feeling might have a cry or write something and then try to figure out a way through the feeling or at least a way to continue in spite of it.  Instead of that, tho, she just, like, gifts me a few days of verbal abuse.  Sometimes every other month, sometimes more than once a month.  Recently more often.  It was like this a few years ago.

And she never acts on any of the threats and she doesn't mean any of the insults and it's all repeat bullshit, at least on the receiving end.  It's always been hollow idiocy to try to exercise (exorcise?) feelings through.  

It's like if she could attach her feeling to a baseball and throw it really hard that it would leave her.

But, she's throwing them at me?  I don't know why.  Maybe I'm just the closest thing to throw things at.  Maybe she thinks I won't be as reactionary about it than if she did it to other people.

And, like, I try to not go numb to it cos I know that doesn't help, but it's hard to avoid.  She will be fine in a few days, alive, here, and back on track.  I honestly just want to let it wash over me most of the time.  I don't even wanna engage."

An old coworker who had made herself into the matron of the establishment and master manipulator of new staff, having outlasted (outstayed?) all other workers she started with, would ask me ""Why do you look so sad?"" and insisted that I looked sad even though I was looking up from, I dunno, cutting a rainbow out of construction paper or designing a simple puzzle game.  She only asked it when she wanted an in to try to get at me.

Another coworker at another job (likely uNPD) who harassed me for months online would wait for my resting face to harass me in public.  ""I HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT 〇〇,"" he'd bull-charge in while I was thoroughly zoned out, ""LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT 〇〇!!...""

My pwBPD often talks about ""Oh you look so MAD"" when she's being poorly behaved, or ""Oh, why the long face?  Did I upset you?""  Ppl can read anything they like into a blank face when they want to, but I honestly have this paranoia that manipulation-minded ppl see it as a soft-spot.

We are smiling and talking now, and we’ve made a plan to get her sorted out with what she needs to feel okay-er in the long run, including a return to counselling when we can secure it.  But good lord of Hell was it ever a long fuckin’ day.

In reply!!  First, let me say that I really really like your username.  Second, let me apologize, cos I wrote way more than I intended to😅✨

Yeh, of course it impacts me.  I don’t really decide when my partner’s perfect storm will happen and I suddenly have to be on a swivel, like you said.  I understand you feeling uneasy.  But there are a few things that have been particularly helpful, I guess.  I’ll talk about one.

I always make sure there’s a place in our home I can get away to if sleep or quiet needs to happen for me but foulness is upon her.  Like, we’ve lived in three apartments together and every one had a sofa or a daybed in the living room or something.

The official reason we always have a good second snoozing place like that is “in case one of us is sick,” but having two places that lying down can happen has more than a few times offered me safe haven without seeming to her like I’m abandoning her in a fragile state.

Like, I’d rather sleep and not set her off more while giving her space to find her way back to position one, and be more clearheaded myself to help her with anything appropriate should it arise.

In general, having two places to be in the home that, while only marginally divided, are reasonably separate can be close enough to still be warm but far enough to have an implicit boundary, even when sleeping is not being sacrificed.

I’m glad you mentioned taking care of one’s self, cos it can be really easy to forget when you’re overwhelmed😅  I hope you’re making sure to take care of yourself.  What you’re going through sounds pretty chaotic and overwhelming. 

It sounds like you don’t live together though, so you have the ultimate out.  If she wakes you up yelling at you, you can go home.  That’s profoundly rude, and I’m sorry that it happens."
AnxietyDepression,f0p8hbp,t3_d5tgd0,1568829452.0,"Hi!  I’ve had very bad panic attacks and I’ve also experienced heart failure.  I’ve been spending the past year recovering from it and the surgery I had for it.

And I’ve now written this post three times.  Bring on number four!

Heart attacks and heart failure are so different from how I register emotional/psychological pain.  Your heart screwing up really teaches you what dying feels like.

Panic attacks are harder, though, in my opinion.  Way more emotional and you’re physically able to revel in the feeling of it more.

So, if you’re worried you might be having a heart attack while you’re maybe having a panic attack, try to answer these questions to yourself:

1) Has this happened before?
2) Is there anyone nearby who can help me?
3) How’s my breathing?

If you were able to answer those questions, you’re sticking around a lot longer than the average person having a heart attack.

But still!  Try to get your breathing together enough to find support until you can support yourself.  I’ve suffered needlessly in my past from not seeking help for what I didn’t understand in my own body.  Beyond this, if your panic attacks are debilitating that carries its own risks.

But with heart failure and heart attacks, yeah, you just kinda die most of the time.  No time to answer the questions, too much physical trauma to think."

Like, don't get me wrong, I checked to make sure.  It's not every day someone will tell you their relationship with you has basically been an abduction from their... _real_ life?  And yeah.  I didn't do that.

And not only did I conclude, ""No, that's horseshit,"" I was also like, ""That's horseshit that takes three hours away from an otherwise normal disagreement?????""  

Augh, it was so disappointing, cos she's a genuinely bright and emotionally intelligent person, and to have her depart from that so recklessly and suddenly was jarringly against what I recognized as her modus operandi, and I mostly just wanted her to disagree with me normally so we could problem-solve whatever was at hand.

(it's still disappointing when it happens now, btw😅 it just happens less)

So I started thinking about how to effectively combat it.  Cos, like, it's not like yelling or simply explaining ever helped.  It was also around this time that I got real familiar with ""selective amnesia"" cos these parts of conversations (or anything else inappropriate or abusive that she said or did) never seemed to come up in her memory when we talked about it the next day...

So I just kinda stopped accepting it.  I wouldn't stoke it in argument when it came up, kept to the point, and when ""clarity time"" came later and we could talk about it, I made it clear that I don't get lied to about what I know to be false.  Not angrily or persistently.  Just that far.

And in a perfect storm of events that happens more often than not, she tells me what's really up.  And then calls me an idiot some more, and then we can talk about it clearer and clearer over the next day or so as is appropriate.

Sorry, kindof privately losing my shit at her selective amnesia and weird alternate-persona arguing stances today, and your post came up, OP.  I try to be appropriately supportive without attempting to CCC.  Sorry for totally writing an effing blog entry here😂🤣😅😢😭"

It's usually at that sudden halt that she's had serious thinking and is tired of feeling super maxxed out.  ""I'm tired of arguing.""  Lol, no kidding, me too.

This is to say, in my partner's case it's usually a sign that she's consciously catching herself and working on bringing it around.  She often has to take some time out and chill for a day or two.

I won't go too deep into her ""current behaviour,"" but she's in the 'anxiously recovering' phase of our move where she's no longer searching for arguments but a bit tender to criticism.  We've been riding bicycles and dancing to the radio a lot, which shows a return to activity grounded in reality beyond the simply pragmatic.

I go out to events and meet with friends and stuff a few times a week, and she encourages it.  When I come back she's always done something really useful, like made some kind of sauce or organized something that's been bothering her, and she's super chilled out.  

These days about 75% of our communication is grounded, loving, and clear.  I'd say when we arrived here with our truck full of stuff that I'd only get about a half-day of meaningful communication at best.  When we were packing I'd lost her for the most part, but right up until packing we were 95+% normal and grounded.

So, like I said, I guess we have a successful relationship?  There's a lot of extra stuff entailed in it that my friends don't have to deal with.  I know nearly everyone reads this thinking, ""She's got this guy trained,"" and to a degree I have to agree with that, but we live a pretty successful chaos-free life the vast majority of the time due to her efforts.

But her regressing to poor behaviour is consistently rooted in anxiety, which is something I can directly relate to.  Like, no doubt, I'm way better at coping with my own anxiety, but I never have to think ""Is this gonna be forever?"" cos it's predictable to an almost pitiable level.

The primary ongoing struggle, is that I am her primary stress dump.  Her taking the world's problems and projecting them on me has been a recurring issue.  It takes some talking through, but we eventually peel the issue off my face and talk about it properly in the air.

It's something of a bimonthly juggling act, usually but not always aggravated by hormones, and always fed by anxiety."

BPDlovedones,eyg097l,t1_eyemb9j,1567058644.0,"""Not an overnight fix.""  This.  All my this.

Nor is it on us to fix, nor to wait around till that fix completes.

That CCC thing.  One does not white knight nor fixer-upper the PD crowd.

Also... not super healthy to think about ""fixing"" a partner, right?"
BPDlovedones,eyfxmkj,t3_cwrte8,1567057128.0,"I guess you could say so?

My partner went through years of therapy before she ended up with me, told me about her diagnosis when our relationship got serious, encouraged me to look into it cos (as I later discovered) pretty much no one ever fully ""heals"" from BPD, and told me that if her diagnosis was a no-go for me that she understood.  I was sorta impressed by that and vowed to be realistic about how capably and sustainably I could commit to her.

We've been together for six years now.  Don't get me wrong, there have been some profoundly difficult times and some persisting emotional dysregulations I need to mind.  Just, not to the degree of most of what I read on this sub, and not nearly as cruel as what many folks here describe, and mostly just in periods of change.

She's dedicated to breaking/overcoming the cycle of abuse first and foremost, and I think that's where her will and efforts to overcome BPD draw strength from."
BPDlovedones,eyfs8cd,t3_cwr5bx,1567054075.0,"Breaking/trashing stuff is one thing I'm glad I've never had to deal with.  My pwBPD will threaten to do stuff like that sometimes but never actually do it.  Pretty sure it's conscious self-control.

Which is nice, because I have some pretty nice-yet-smashable things..."

This reminds me of the dumb anomaly of "" that hot chick on the net _must_ be a dude, cos they appealed to my penis and balls so successfully.""

Being one's self is not a ""show"" game, no matter what some folks think.  Looking like one's self is a conscious and subconscious effort against dysphoria, which I see as a positive thing.

As my tattooist is fond of saying, ""Do you.""  Let's do our various usses."

agender,ey6wxiz,t3_cvkvyr,1566865819.0,"I am very very ""cis passing"" by virtue of genetics and I've decided that this is okay.  Perhaps it's of benefit to others to be a double agent.  Only my partner and close friends really need to know.

But the few people who don't ""get it"" who come into the know that I'm agender ask whether I've been with a man before, as though that's some kind of hurdle you have to overcome to properly be less than 100% male.

Which is to say, I don't get asked about my genitals, I get asked who I stick them in🤣😂🤣☺️✨"

But words seem important in the form of apologies and clear truths.

And actions seem most important when she's stuck in a loop worried about something and I take care of it simply cos I'm not stuck.  And taking care of her when she's sick or in a bad way.

But, y'know, I won't apologize for things I haven't done and not a lot of truths are clear just by themselves, and it's not like I'm gonna do just _anything_ cos she breaks down.

Gotta pick your battles and only act as you feel is fair in  as appropriate and sober a way as you can reasonably consider things."

I think they don't understand, tho, how good at the ""long game"" introverts are.  I rarely feel like the underdog because of this."
