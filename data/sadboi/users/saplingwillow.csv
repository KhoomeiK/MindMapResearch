shortscarystories,fr3fmea,t1_fr2ibrd,1589856371.0,"this is GREAT advice. i want to share one caveat: please be so so careful. if you do fight back, make sure you have a plan or some backup. i was tired of being abused by my older cousin, so i decided to fight back against him one day after a particularly cruel act, but he was bigger and stronger than me and no one else was around. things went.. very badly for me. unspeakably bad. i had no idea he had the capacity to do what he did. i was sure he wasn't that kind of person. mean and arrogant, sure, but he was family. it never even occurred to me as a possibility.  figured the worst that could happen is i'd get my ass kicked.

the next several years were hell on earth. i couldn't bring myself to tell anyone what he did to me for 6 years, and when i finally did, well.. that went poorly at first as well, and probably would still be awful if his sister hadn't caught him physically abusing his ex husband. 

if you are able, you should absolutely stand up for yourself!! you're amazing, you're worthy, you deserve the utmost respect and you should absolutely demand it. just.. don't be as stupid as i was lol. make sure you know what your bully is capable of, and stay safe. please. ðŸ’œ be well. im cheering for you!!"

Do you mind if I ask if you needed a lawyer for your situation? Do you happen to know what kind of lawyer I should contact if I do need one? Maybe my credit union can help with that, I'm assuming they see this situation often enough. Oof, I don't even know how one finds a lawyer in the first place. Thank you again!"

I appreciate you trying to understand, so fucking much. Thank you, I am so incredibly grateful! It's actually not a dream-like state at all, and everything seems very real. It's that sense of knowing that you are in a nightmare, but applied to a crisp and cutting reality. Reality is solid, I am grounded in my body, but I feel.. existentially.. wrong? That's the only word I'm coming up with right now, but it doesn't really convey the feeling, it's too vague and not quite right either, lol. 

It's a very distinct and unique feeling, nothing like the panic attacks or anxiety I've felt before. (""... I experience anxiety often and I've had recurring panic attacks since adolescence.. and this is a distinctly different feeling than anything else I've ever felt."" ;D hehe)

I take Lamotrigine. It doesn't really help with most of the things I deal with, and I'm hoping to talk to a new psych about that asap, but I'm at least less of a raging monster on it xD"
mentalhealth,f7qgwwd,t3_dxhkg8,1573963751.0,"Hey there. My name's Willow, and I just wanted to tell you that they're wrong. I don't know you at all but I know damn well that you are worth so much more than you're being given credit for. You matter, you are important, and I personally care about you. And it's okay to be tired. You are under so much pressure. I won't tell you it's all going to be fine, because I can't see the future and I can't possibly know, but it has a decent chance of getting better, and that's worth everything. I'm so sorry this is such a hideous situation. I don't want to offer any advice because I don't know anything about your situation except for this very post, but I can be here to listen if you need to talk to someone."
