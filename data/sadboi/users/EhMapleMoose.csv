Sure a faulty computer model with broken code predicted millions dead and that number has gone steadily down. They also predicted millions dead from the Avian Flu, the Swine Flu and Ebola. Nothing ever came of it. Fear was installed into the populace and charts predicted millions dead. Every time the virus largely went away before a vaccine was finished.   

Trump can’t be held responsible for an unprecedented event. It’d be the same as holding bush responsible for the crash following the 9/11 attacks.   

Trump had built the economy efficiently and created millions of jobs. The virus wiped them out in months. I’d rather see a president with a proven track record of creating jobs then one who forgets where he is, what he’s talking about.

[Here’s another article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1194046) warning of how Chinese Ventilators could kill patients. There’s also concern that putting a patient on a ventilator will kill them. The death rate for those hospitalized is about 20% which is in line with other respiratory illnesses.

If Trump is to blame then the democrat party, the WHO and the EU are the media are just as much to blame. I understand there was a high amount of xenophobia at the beginning because people were scared. But when Trump closed down travel between China and put a 14 day isolation period in place he was ripped to shreds by the WHO and CNN, VOX, Democrat politicians and Canada. The same happened when he shut down travel to Europe. The EU called it an overreaction.

[New York officials encouraged people to go to Chinese New Year](https://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/chinese-lunar-new-year-1.41650522) despite fears of Coronavirus and social distancing being practiced elsewhere. Cuomo actually comptes it to the Zola outbreak and Ebola saying no one should be concerned about anything related to the virus because the common flu was more likely.  

Trump at the same time had called the coronavirus a public health emergency. The day before celebrations Trump briefed Governors in the response and the concerns. If we back the timeline up further to mid-January Trump was working with the CDC and Homeland security to screen passengers coming into the US and giving travel advisory warnings to the public. Mid-January Democrats were hilariously marching across the capitol to deliver impeachment papers."

I also saw someone blame the recession on Trump which is hilarious. Trump cannot be held accountable for what the virus has done to the economy and the world. Someone will say he can be held accountable for the deaths and incompetence. I would respond saying no. He did not force senior homes to take back patients who tested positive for the virus, Cuomo did. Know what else Cuomo did? In the middle of a ventilator shortage he refused the help of in state manufactures who volunteered factories to build them. Other things that are happening in New York include death certificates being incorrectly labeled as covid deaths so the state can ask for more funding."

There is no evidence I’ve seen that he has. His connections to Nazis and people who have been vocal about sterilizing the population are sketchy and thin at best. Like incredibly thin but also sketchy and concerning enough to warrant further investigation.

Let me be very clear I am not anti-vaccine I am anti-stupidity, I mean anti-stupidity as there are people upset with having their children tested on so unless all the facts come out I think Gates did some suspicious things in those countries. That does not make me distrust vaccines though, let me be clear on my experience.   

My parents ( who are also not anti-vaxxers) are cautious. As a child somewhat to appease me and my debilitating fear of needles and somewhat out of fear that I would die, I was only given the mandatory vaccines. My older brother was specially exempted from some vaccine because he is deathly allergic to eggs. Some vaccines have egg protein in them apparently because he nearly died as a baby getting some shots. This caused my parents to be a touch fearful of losing us and over abundantly cautious. 

As a result I’ve been raised as to take only mandatory vaccines. I know I’ve gone back and gotten at least one (HPV) and I‘ve yet to go get the other I know for a fact I didn’t get (Hep B). I don’t know vaccines and I trust the doctors advice. My parents had a reason to be cautious and fearful. They were protective of me and my brother. There were difficulties having both of us and nearly losing a child to vaccines.

agedlikemilk,fq34u00,t3_ggh0r5,1589063015.0,Coronavirus cases across the world are being inflated so government can ask for more money. Nurses are being pressured to call each death covid even if it’s not. While I don’t think the numbers that are being stated today are accurate I don’t think they’re below the average flu death.
politics,fq0pcn3,t1_fq0m5p7,1589035501.0,"I’m not sure of the reason. It may very well be what he said, just a difference of political opinion. But Flynn was never accepted by the FBI which is why he thought they were extending an olive branch when Trump appointed him.   

He’s also not wrong about the Democrats hypocrisy. It’s easy to see in two examples, Bill Cosby drugged and raped women he is in prison whereas Cardi B admitted on tape to drugging, raping and stealing from men and she is praised as doing what she had to do. The other example is Joe Biden. He stated that no one is entitled to public office and if there are sexual allegations than the person should have an FBI investigation launched into them. He fought hard for against Brett Kavanaugh when the evidence was flimsy and in the ended turned out that the allegations were false. Media was all over it then. Tara Reade accusés Joe Biden and suddenly no investigation needs to be done and he doesn’t believe her accusations. The media barely covers it and when they did Joe failed to give a convincing defence and constantly failing to find the words. [Watch the interview here.](https://youtu.be/seu_C08yAAM) The real hypocrisy from the Democratic Party is people calling out Donald trump saying how could you vote for someone with sexual assault allegations and then turning around and saying even if the allegations against Biden are true I will still vote for him."
politics,fpzwe69,t1_fpy4mpx,1589024682.0,"He had an informal conversation in a hallway with FBI agents who then reported it as an official interview. The operation was specifically set up to entrap him for perjury. The FBI agents should never have been talking to him at that time for that purpose. The trap was set with former President Obama in the loop. The FBI banked on Trumps staff not knowing procedure because they were brand new so the FBI broke procedure.   

Now that transcripts and documents have been declassified the case against Flynn was dropped because pursuing it means going after democratic officials. It has nothing to do with Trump and everything to do with the hypocrisy of the Democrat party. They relentlessly pursues sexual assault allegations with no evidence for weeks and months when a person is conservative or republican but when they’re on the left? They don’t mention it often. Give them the benefit of the doubt and allow the person a platform to defend themselves while they help to defend them and accuse the accuser of making it up. Also the hypocrisy of convincing rapist, scum and drugger of people Bill Cosby while Cardi B who on recording admits she has drugged men and stolen from them is praised and nothing comes of it."

It was normally held in Lewis’ college rooms at Magdalen College Thursday evenings. Later the informal pub meetings were moved from The Bird to across the street at The Lamb and Flag.   

Also fun fact is that the informal society they created was called the Inklings after a society that Lewis and Toilken were a part of a society of the same name."

conspiracy,fpvjjwk,t1_fpv2wqa,1588946075.0,"There’s many reasons to hunt, over population, pest control, habitat destruction, crop destruction (pest control), sick animals endangering wildlife population (rabies and whatnot). Also food. I have an appreciation for the animals, they are beautiful creatures and can be real funny and derpy and cute. They’re also damn delicious and sometimes a danger to people living in the area and a threat to crops.   

For example on the threat to crops I would bring your attention to the wild pigs that ravage the United States in Louisiana, Alabama and many other states. Those pigs have made their way north into Canada. They are destructive to crops, disruptive to the natural wildlife that make their home there and dangerous to people. They breed like crazy and leave a wake of destruction in their wake. So much so that some places have lifted hunting restrictions on them and encourage the hunting of the species. In some states wild pigs outnumber the human population by quite a bit. Hunting is necessary."
