polyfamilies,fgir3dt,t3_exwqe9,1580829013.0,"My first exposure to polyamory was back when I lived in Columbia, SC. The three dudes from ""True Life: I'm Polyamorous"" were down there fairly often. At the time I didn't quite get it. I didn't have a high opinion of the guys. I didn't watch the episode so I thought they were just doing it for attention. 

Fast forward 10 years. I'm happily married to an awesome dude. We make friends with some guy I dated in college who had moved to NYC for medical school. My husband and I both fall in love with him on accident. It was very organic when we were all three together but then when I was on my own I felt like we were doing something wrong. Fortunately, I started seeing an awesome psychiatrist and she explained polyamory to me and then we all started reading articles about being poly. Around the same time Netflix came out with their ""Monogamy Explained"" short documentary and that also cemented in my head that polyamory can be natural.

The relationship ended about 6 months after it started, but my husband and I decided that we'd be open to it happening again. We even opened up the relationship for sexual encounters. Neither one of us took much advantage of that but it was nice to have the option. We actually started dating someone else about 2 months ago and it's going amazingly. We call ourselves a ""triumvirate"" because ""throuple"" sounds dumb to us and we like the definition of ""triumvirate"" more."

news,f8tia4d,t3_e20mk0,1574803962.0,I’ve been in remission since February from CPTSD thanks to psilocybin. Only took two trips with fairly small doses. I’m very excited about this. There are other members of my family with similar disorders that could definitely benefit from it. Plus I feel like I’ll need a “booster” at some point.

It’s been about 8 months since my last dose and although I do sometimes get a little depressive, I no longer lash out and I’m still considered “in remission”. My therapist actually recommended I do a “booster” every 6 months.

It wasn’t facilitated by my therapist because that wouldn’t be legal but we did talk through what I experienced after every trip."

You could maybe try bringing her to a therapist with you. I did that with my mom when I was in college and it totally changed our relationship. My mom has always been sort of impressionable, though."
