dating_advice,fr4fu49,t1_fr4fkt5,1589886890.0,"Actually. No. I dated someone for 2.5 years. He did not cheat but is still to this day obsessed with me writing poems, sending me music etc. 
My 2nd, 5.5 years. I was ill for a long time and he chose another woman over me. 
My last relationship was 5 mo. He was intelligent, self motivated, incredibly talented but shy and quiet. It took me a few months to catch on to the mental and verbal abuse, like actually understand what he was doing as well as the manipulation. The physical portion started soon after and I was immediately out. 

Poor assumption, frankly."

I used to be light with everything, nothing heavy. 


Always laughing, smoking, cooking, cleaning, writing, learning and tripping. Open.


Open to everyone. Too much. Too trustworthy. Too accepting. & I lost my self to cheating mates & abusive bfs. 

Lost and alone."
therapy,fr4deau,t3_gmkj6y,1589884588.0,"Hi :) 
Fellow scrambled brain here. 
Diagnosed with lots due to my upbringing so don’t be alarmed or expect the same outcome. 
I have:
PTSD- triggers past thoughts and traumas
BPD- cause rapid change in emotion, unrealistic reactions and responses 
BiPolar 1 & major depression
Anxiety
Insomnia 

I try my mightiest not to allow these “labels” to confine me or box me up but it helped make sense of the static, constant noise in my head and slowing the spiraling of my head that rapidly increased during night hours.

You’re not insane. And, as someone said above, that fact that you can acknowledge and address such an issue, shows you are not. —I’ve asked my doctor probably a good ten times. He’s asked me to stop. 

I began writing around your age. Perhaps walks will help. 

Intrusive thoughts are some of the moments I hate most in my life. I see quick murder scenes, or imagine someone in front of me running breaking their leg or, when in a car, I’m constantly prepared to die (probably has something to do w the way my mom passed) looking 360 around the car, non-stop. But when i imagine ppl getting hurt, it’s like worst case scenario stuff- like I have to be prepared just in case. I always cringe. The incest thing I think happened to all of us at that age. Eve if you’re not attracted to the other person, it just rudely barges in your head. 

Anyway, if you have any questions, lmk. 
I AM NOT A DOCTOR just really love therapy."

sex,fqfajm5,t3_gifr55,1589321492.0,"May I coat tail off this and ask, as someone who was w someone for 5.5 years and used the term “open relationship” before we were aware of the “ethically non-monogamous” term, what happens there? 

As I’ve moved on from the relationship I realized that was the proper terminology; ethically non-monogamous. 
At the time, we were saying open. However, we had rules and our priorities were to be with each other. 
He cheated, for four months, while I was in and out of hospital care & people could not grasp that it was cheating (dating a woman for months, engaging sexually, buying gifts, dinners, not visiting me while ill so he could be with her, etc). 

I recently had this epiphany while tripping. Like last week."

mentalhealth,fojxq29,t1_foiq6xu,1587831510.0,"I have been in wards for most of the years from 2015-19. I haven’t any attempts since July. I AM NOT A DOCTOR. However, as someone who spent much of their life the last 3.5 years going from hospital to treatment center back to a ward, I can say that being there is a haunting experience. Sometimes, they are able to give you some tools but the ppl who are in with you can and likely will give you a skewed version of reality, leaving one even more confused. 

Please, I know it may be tiresome, but explain to him you want to be there for him and want to do right by him. Have a conversation and ask how you can help him, if possible. 

I wish you both the best of luck during this process. It may be a long road to recovery, as normally, some fall back into intrusive thoughts. Be patient, try to understand and converse with him to let him know you care and want to help. 
He may be a bit resentful right now considering he was sent to a ward. It’s scary in there sometimes."

I was so happy, a free spirit, I engaged with everyone I met, kind of a social butterfly. 
Then we started hanging out and the stares started- to creep me out or have me believe I did something wrong. I’d spend my night waiting for whatever social event we were attending to end, dreading going home bc he wouldn’t speak despite my attempts to alleviate the situation. His eyes are ice blue, piercing and he knows I get scared and how I feel when he does it and yet..he still does it and at EOD he just days, “oh nothings bothering me!” Meanwhile I’ve been paranoid the whole time. 

Once I sat at a table two feet away from his friend and I kept my head down, like a battered woman, as they sat there and disparaged my body and pretty much anything you could think of. I didn’t stand up for myself. I just sat there and listened not making a sound. 

My father was incredibly abusive to us and my mother. I think the familiarity is comfortable?

For example, if I were to drive on it, become drowsy and be involved in an accident, the pharmaceutical company is protected because the lawyers thought to list drowsiness as a POTENTIAL side effect. 

Food for thought. I got chewed out bc of it."
