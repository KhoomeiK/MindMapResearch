They do so much anyways so the least I can do is help decrease some of the back pain and lift a few patients with them and whatnot(: its really great having a facility where we each respect and care for eachother in the field, especially with tough times like this. Teamwork makes the dream work!"

I have the same problem trying to decipher how i feel at most times too and it really helps having someone there who is patient with you and let you attempt to explain/express things step by step, even if the first step is saying ""i think i feel sad"" when low key, you're drowning, head barely above water, in the low feelyfeels."
