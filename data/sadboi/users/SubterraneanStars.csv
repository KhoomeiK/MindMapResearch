Anxiety,fjdwj48,t3_fcsgni,1583260628.0,That's horrible and I feel for you as i'm in the same boat. Laying in bed right now dreading work because my upper body is is so much pain I can hardly move. My anxiety manifests as severe pain and weakness in my body and it's debilitating. Every time It starts up I desperately want to go to the hospital but I'm already 10k in medical debt (thanks America) and can't afford to go seek any more medical attention. Sending good thoughts your way and hoping you can find some peace soon. </3
Anxiety,eu55xig,t3_ceu91n,1563470587.0,Yes! Way too much. I actually apologized to my friend yesterday for getting upset because she hurt my feelings and then laughed about it. It's a bad habit.
Anxiety,es13sp4,t3_c5d189,1561488604.0,"I'm in the same boat. Can't have caffeine due to a combination of anxiety and vasovagal syncope. I've found that drinking vitamin infused water helps perk me up a little bit though! Not exactly the same energy rush as you get with caffeine, but it helps a little."
