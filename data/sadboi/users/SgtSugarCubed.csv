mentalillness,fq0onjx,t3_ggc1ka,1589035204.0,"I suffer also from depression and anxiety. Brushing my teeth and taking showers/washing & brushing my hair are some of the things I struggle with in the same way. I have even come to finding myself turning on water in the bathroom and just standing in there to ""make it look like"" I am taking a shower, so that i dont really have to. 
I think it is actually fucking ridiculous that i do this, and so i (as backwards and silly as this may sound) will use my invasive negative thoughts to my advantage. I will almost talk down to myself and shame myself for being so ridiculous as to take the same amount of time and effort to pretend to do the thing, instead of just doing it. Then I just convince myself that I might as well just actually take my shower, and I do it in spite, like a child angrily doing chores they done want to, but it gets done so after it all I end up feeling a bit better and I forced ""self care"" so that's cool too.

I dont know if this helps at all, basically I just make myself temporarily miserable and angry by forcing myself to do what I dont want to because I give myself shit for not doing it like a normal person, and then it works out. Lol. I'm used to horrible negative self talk though. So if that isn't your cup of tea i am absolutely not encouraging it, but maybe if you deal with that anyways it could be a way to use it to help :) 

Best of luck, regardless. I definitely relate to your struggle."
mentalillness,fpol6t3,t3_gejo69,1588786356.0,"I can relate to this.
I feel like an empty shell. I used to be very artistic and passionate about it when I was a teen. Now I feel like I have no ability to hold those hobbies anymore. I cant even think of music, even though I still love music (and used to write when I was younger) if someone asked me what I wanted to listen to, I wouldn't have an answer. I dont have hobbies anymore. I dont have anything to talk about when I'm at work or wherever. I can make surface value conversation about current situations and things actually going on, but I dont have any interests, I dont do anything for fun, I just sit around and start at my phone or TV or something until it's time for work again. I sit and stare at paints and canvas next to my bed, but I cant bring my mind to let me think enough to form any inspiration. I dont even have a way to figure out a new hobby to occupy me. I dont know what to do with my hair, my ""style"", i literally cant piece together my own personality because I feel like I'm not who I used to be. I have a lot of surface value personality traits that I put on around other people, but underneath that I feel like a blank face. 

I'm diagnosed major depression and anxiety, and my psych and therapist think something else is going on but they aren't sure what, yet. I currently take lithium(300+600) and wellbutrin(300+100). I could be wrong but all I really feel out of it all is a brief energy boost from the wellbutrin. 

It sucks to share a body with someone you dont feel like you know. I hope you can find a way to relieve that feeling soon, I'll report back if I find anything that works too, haha."

You may not be sure how it's supposed to feel considering how things were between you guys for a time, but shes still your mom, shes still the mom you grew up with, and please just let yourself feel however you feel. Dont question it and dont fight it. What she did wasn't to do with you. I had a similar situation with my dearest best friend as a young adult, it took me a long time to convince myself she was just in pain that I couldn't touch. I had made some mistakes shortly before it that I told myself could have prevented the event if I had not made those choices. But really, they are already hurting, the pain is there, and that type of thing is something that no one can interfere with. 

Just allow yourself to feel, no matter what it is, because trying to avoid it is how substance abuse often happens in the first place. - I say that speaking from experience, not because I read it in a book somewhere. - It let's the pain live longer and do more damage if you ignore it.

You feel like a better mom, and by NO means am I trying to make it seem like I am saying you're not a good mom, but you have to find a way to teach yourself that you are a good parent without the drug. The drug is there to make you want more of it. So if making you think the drug is what causes success for you, then that's the thought tape that will play in your head. Maybe you can consider Medical Cannabis for the pain, if thats something that might be up your alley. Either way, I just get worked up when I'm worried about someone going down the dark opioid path, so I hope nothing I said seemed too aggressive.

You know you're keeping it from loved ones. Why is that? Because they would be upset? Usually loved ones are upset by things that harm the ones they love (that's you!). As a currently sober addict myself, it helps to think of the things you do from the perspective of if you saw your mom or sister or brother or daughter, whatever, doing the things you do, and how would you feel. Probably upset?
I love that you've opened up about it, even just here because that's something. If you're not ready for professional help, start to self review what the root problems are, or what the primal reward/purpose of the substance is. Does it help you relax? Can you sub that with a walk or a book? Does it distract you from painful thoughts? Would a good TV show or a lunch with family help too? Those are pretty mild suggestions but just remember. If what you were doing now (drugs) was actually helping, you would actually feel better and stronger. We can both agree that the solution you've found to your problem is not the right one. So it's time to look for something else. And it might just be possible that someone else could contribute a decent suggestion.

Please dont be afraid to let others help. That's all I have to say. The drugs will always be there, if you try something better and you hate it, you can always be an addict again. And basically nothing is gonna get worse than that.

Best of luck."

My pain is there and my mental weight and my anxiety and it actually truthfully honestly makes me so angry and frustrated with myself at times that I don't get entirely dysfunctional, just because I feel that i don't seem to struggle as much as some people I know do, and sometimes I wish people could see my pain and at least know that I'm not okay.
I guess you would say I'm just ""high functioning"" but I genuinely go through my days wearing such a strong fake smile that I literally have serious trouble even when I go to therapy not to just slap on a happy face and tone of voice and pretend everything is fine.

I currently carry a full notebook around at work, along with pieces of paper and multiple pens just to be sure I always have one. It can work really well. But I feel like my mind is just at another level some times and it makes me feel like complete trash when I see that 95% of other people don't have to struggle like this.
Writing things down is great, when I remember them long enough to write them down. I often won't remember something I've been told or something I say by the time the conversation is over. So reflection is often not an option. Or alternatively I may forget that I need to write something down, as it strikes me as something really simple and natural to remember, and it's not always easy to tell if it actually will be or not when it comes time to remember it. Sometimes it's fine, sometimes not. And the 3rd biggest culprit of my irritation comes from when I can actually write something down for myself to remember later, I've made myself stop everything I'm doing to write down this note of important things I need to do or remember later on, only to completely forget that I've written anything so I never remember or even consider to look to see if there's anything I need to remember when it comes time.
My memory isn't really like the sensation of forgetting mostly. For me it's a complete lack of a memory being formed, like trying really hard to remember something that actually never happened. The memory never existed. It's not like knowing a situation happened but you can't recall a detail, it's like trying to remember when I had that surgery to change my skin from purple to polka dot. It literally just doesn't exist. But logically I know whatever I need to remember did happen but my brain just never grasped it.

My psychiatrist a year ago finally brought to my attention that depression and anxiety can have a big influence on your memory functions. I really feel like that's a huge piece of it for me. But it's harming my ability to feel like an adult, like a functioning person, and it makes me feel so stupid. I hate that 'everyone' else around me can just function throughout a day and not struggle when they are asked what they did over the last two hours. Or when they get to the store and can't remember what they came there for without a list, if they remember to bring the list after they write it, and barely really truly remember even going to the store.

Tbh it makes the whole depression thing a thousand times worse. Kind of fucking ridiculous if you ask me but eh. If you did ask, I don't remember, so you're on your own."

I am constantly made to feel awkward/""rude"", and unprofessional in a way, that I don't just go up and great every person I walk past on the street or while I work. 
I have no issue talking to anyone when I have a reason to. Whether that's answering a work question, or if I'm out and about at a store and need something or interact with an employee there in some way. But I'm not going to just interject myself into someone's life briefly for the sake of making sure they know I'm nice and helpful.

I would hate to think you'd have to wait for it to get worse before they'd not bat an eye at you going back for more testing but I mean, if they think it's anxiety why aren't they having you get that treated?

The most notorious affect of MDMA is what it does to your brain. Like it actually can physically change it, from what I understand / have been told. I could be totally wrong on that, but all those symptoms sound like something that needs treatment in some way, whether that's a heart situation, or if it's psychological.  If the EKG comes back fine yet again, I would consult them on what else may specifically be causing all of this because clearly it's not normal for you and it's, by the sound of your description, markedly impacting your quality of life."

I mean, if disordered eating was the only way to fix the way you view/feel about yourself, I think it'd be much more normal to have one.
I have struggled with this for quite a few years now, it doesn't help. It just makes you miserable while increasing all the sadness you were trying to fix in the first place.
Many damages that eating disorders cause the body will be permanent and not not not not worth it.
Ask any recovering person if they think the digestive, gastrointestinal, skin, hair, teeth, bone, immune... I mean haha use your imagination.

Showerthoughts,f5jimp6,t3_dnzix0,1572229619.0,"I agree with this. I am a recovering addict and I overdosed particularly badly once and the memory stays with me. I can't speak for what it's like for anyone else so maybe this is totally normal, but I didn't even know it happened. It wasn't like a fade away. And I didn't feel ""gone"". I didn't feel anything. I dint feel a sense of nothingness, I didn't hear silence, I didn't see black, it was just such a complete absent sense of non-existant that I would have never known it happened except that I (obviously ) survived. 
Narcan forced me back into life, and now I have lived knowing death and it's wild to me. It's not like sleeping at all.
I've OD'd quite a few times and that time was different, it was a thin line that I even survived anyways. I was gone and only survived long enough for the EMTs to arrive because one of the people I was with knew CPR. If not for that physically keeping me alive, I would have died quite instantaneously upon ingestion of that dose.

Didn't stop me from using right away, but it's still a haunting ""feeling"" or lack there of, just feel like I know what to expect now. Literally nothing. Which is nice to at least not really wonder or fantasize/romanticize anything about being dead. 

Doesn't make me want it less, but that's anything other topic for another thread I suppose."

I told her I'm fine, because I don't know how to tell my family I also have an eating disorder, which is the true reason I was so thin when I went to rehab.

Shut the fuck up about the job thing dude. My point was so fucking far from jobs it's not even funny. I'm concerned about the quality of life and lessons learned (or lack there of) for your children.  I couldn't give two fuck about your opinion on the work and employment world. Yes child care involves money and that's important but that's literally not what I am pointing out. If u wanna be a drug addict and only care about yourself because you're selfish and immature and stupid then fine have fun, but don't fuck over your kids chance at a decent upbringing. When is the last time someone was super stoked about their parents partying and not caring? People might lie to themselves but if ur honest with your own self you know that shit is not cool. Not when you chose to have kids."
mentalillness,ezpjts4,t3_d1p1nm,1568042037.0,"Dude tbh, u understand you opposition to the meaning of ""maturiy"" but it's something you need to look at from a different angle. It's not about work and school. It's about realizing that your life has come to a point where having fun is not the priority anymore. Sure any 25yo person has the freedom to experiment with lifestyle to find their interests and goals in life. HOWEVER. You've made the concious decision to have children. 4. FOUR KIDS. If you decided to do that, you need to stand back and realize these kids are effected by literally every decision you make. They see every god damn thing you do and think it is how a person should behave. Fun is great, but honestly. Like seriously. If you are not capable of growing up and admitting to yourself you need to prioritize your children in order to give them a chance at the life they deserve to have, then give them to a fucking family that's grown enough to take care of a fucking human life.
I don't care what you say about being bored, there is no God damn excuse for this behavior.  This is a situation you put yourself in. You had nine months to make each one of those 4 decisions. That's on you. You can feed them. House them. Give them clothes. Keep them clean. That's great, whatever. But that is NOT what being a parent is. THAT is what we call being a caretaker. Anyone can do those things, it doesn't take a mother to put food and clothes and a roof over their head. You need to raise them by example. You are a leader. Lead them to success. If not, let someone who can do it better than you take the wheel.
 I am 25. I am a recovering drug addict. I am mentally ill. Do NOT lie to yourself about your situation. I am not some doctor spouting off my opinion based off books I've read. I've done everything and more than you. And I have 0 kids. Know why? Because I'm honest and smart enough to admit that I could not raise one with the quality of life they deserve, not until I learn how to give that to myself. 
You have a chance to change that shit. You are in control of that. Pick yourself or pick your children. It's as simple as that. I hope you make the right choice. It can be hard to hear the things that need to be said. This is real life. This is not for fun anymore. Lives are involved. Fuck yourself up, whatever, but don't fuck them."
