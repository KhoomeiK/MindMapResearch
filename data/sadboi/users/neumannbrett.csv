Need your advice here along my journey to FIRE.  I just received my yearly bonus($35k pre tax, $22k after tax) and am wondering when and where the best place to invest would be?  Are we riding out this bear market for another month or would you put into some medium or low risk stocks, mutual funds, or hold for now?  Very stable job and not in any rush to withdrawal or do anything drastic.  Cheers all"

I am looking for general advice on maintaining my current cards (meaning downgrading or closing) but also adding new cards to the mix.   Considering I am under the 5/24 (only at 2/24), I am targeting to follow [this flowchart](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/kevlarlover/Card+Recommendation+Flowchart+v13.html).  My goal is to start with Chase Ink, Barclays AA Biz, followed by any other Chase Biz.  Is this appropriate and also when to downgrade the CSR?   Cheers!

* Chase Saphire Preferred (opened 3+ yrs ago)
* Chase Freedom (opened 5+ yrs ago)
* SW Plus (opened 2 yrs ago) - Should i close?  never use and get the annual fee
* Chase Saphire Reserve (opened \~3 yrs ago, AF comes due in Oct)"

One follow up on the CSR, this is my primary CC (to squire points)for all use which is paid off entirely each month    Would you recommend, assuming I’m approved for Ink bus preferred, that the CSR be downgraded to the CF and the ink would be the new primary card?  This way avoiding all fees on other cards?

Cheers"

My wife’s birthday is coming up in early January.  She always mentions to me when we drive over the bride  on lake shore dr (right next to lower Wacker dr) how she loves the view of the city from that standpoint. Does anyone know where I could capture this specific photo of looking down the river and potentially frame it?

Would it make sense to take the picture myself then frame it?

Cheers to all!"
