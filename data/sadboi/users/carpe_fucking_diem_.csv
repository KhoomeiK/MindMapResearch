I explained beforehand that I didn’t want him to do something he felt uncomfortable with and if this was the thing that he didn’t want he didn’t have to do it. Now he told our couples therapist I forced him to do it. But when I tell him it’s not normal to feel that way he says I’m a coward for trying to leave when I just want him to be happy And I just feel like he isn’t. He even tried to use black/white thinking on me saying I never did chores ever, never fed my pets. My sister attests that she’s seen me clean and feed my pets(because I do, but sometimes I’d fall asleep since I wasn’t working and was recovering from a spinal injury )

We had a lot of traumatic events happen over the course of last year. He’s seen some bad things I’ve experienced bad things. 
 
But looking back what started our engagement was the fact we had a party that ended with us hooking up with our friends. Tbh I didn’t want to do it at first but my partner came out naked and this the hooking up happened. But then . the next morning I was so upset about what we did I wanted to breakup because hooking up with others even though we drunkenly consented felt wrong to me.

And then he proposed. I accepted."
