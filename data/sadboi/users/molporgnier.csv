schizophrenia,fp32mjo,t1_fp042js,1588272030.0,"Yeah, one time when I was very tired going into a psychiatrist appointment they asked me the classic 'are you hearing voices? do they tell you to do things?' and I said, 'yes, they tell me to hurt people and kill myself'. Tl:dr for brevity but that was the truth, and it was right to the ward after that."
schizophrenia,fp327jz,t1_fp304qo,1588271828.0,"I have a similar feeling. Like, because I got away from the government all those years ago they have a real vendetta.

That feeling never goes away for me, but when I'm doing everything right (I.e. taking my meds, sleeping enough, exercising, not too stressed) it makes it much easier to ignore."
schizophrenia,fp31u43,t3_gayf5f,1588271648.0,"When I was very young, I was always afraid of people finding out I wasn't normal, in that, I found out very young that people didn't have hallucinations and one of the strongest delusions I've ever had (and still do on bad days when I forget to take my meds) is that everyone is going to drop everything and say 'ok, the charade's over, we know you're sick and you're going to the asylum where you'll never see your friends or family ever again'   


I mention this, because that fear was very real for a long time until I sort of accepted it, and then along with moving all the time it got easier to let go of people and eventually things. Recently I've been trying to come to grips with the idea that my life is 'permanent'. Like, that working towards becoming a better healthier person for myself and not for the benefit of others is something worthwhile, so losing things with sentimental value is a new fear.  


Sorry for being so long and rambly, but I hope this helps."
