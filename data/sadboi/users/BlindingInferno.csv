For now, with the virus still not completely under control, we should stay inside and not go to work. Once everything starts to open up, people won't be able to find jobs. So the government should invest in their citizens with welfare and job programs. I don't think people should be laying on their ass all day in normal times but these are not normal times. Do you realistically expect people to have emergency funds saved up for this even when a majority of people don't have the money for a 500 dollar emergency?

It doesn't matter if you are able bodied and capable of working because wages haven't tracked with inflation for the most part and our minimum wage hasn't changed since the early 2000s, so most people don't have money saved up at all. And we can't blame people's work ethic. There will always be someone who relies on the minimum wage as a baseline of pay to live on and at 7.25 an hour federally, you'll barely afford rent and your bills, even with roommates.  It's the governments failing. We shouldn't have to rely on them like this but we do. ""Refuse to better their lives"". We're in the middle of a PANDEMIC. It is not the time to virtue signal about how much more of a hard worker u are than everybody else, as if work was defines you. I worry about the welfare of my neighbors so that's why we should have welfare programs, the whole purpose of government is for them to provide services, even if you don't like the way your government is structured right now."
