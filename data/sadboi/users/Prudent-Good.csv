As I accomplish the top sticky note which by the way will be the simplest thing that I have to complete. I will then take that sticky note and put it on my refrigerator just like as if I was a little kid again putting my paper with a :-) on the refrigerator. if you keep all the sticky notes that you have to complete in a pile one on top of each other they don't look so scary cuz all you see is the top one. But then as you complete stuff and you see your refrigerator covered with sticky notes do you start to feel better about yourself. Also talked to your instructors they understand. They're living  through this too, they're struggling too. Good luck."

Just as you don't live in theirs. Your world, your reality is what you have, is what you make it. So if your world your reality doesn't bring you any happiness that is a huge  problem. I don't know how to make your reality happy, I struggle everyday to make mine. My reality is so different and the outside world thinks it is. I get to not like yourself thing oh, I don't like me much either. The one thing I can tell you that it has helped me in the past is to tell myself just to shut the f*** up. if I'm all these things that I come up with in my head and my opinion doesn't mean anything anyway so I need to stop I'm listening to myself. Good luck to you."

 Sometimes I think animals are more real than human beings,"
depression,fiz6snw,t3_f51oky,1582855507.0,I could never put my mom or son through it but sometimes it feels like ending it all would be better than them having to be with me.
SuicideWatch,fiz5x3l,t3_f7lhj9,1582854903.0,All the time. It amazes me how I can stand in a room full of people I know and be so terribly alone.
