Basically, Selena Gomez‚Äôs team have put out the story and narrative that a friend of hers gave her , her kidney around 2018. They posted a picture of the 2 of them in hospital beds (classic staged photo). However the reality is that because Selena Gomez is an A lister, she has access to illegal things like the black market. In reality she got her new kidney from the black market - not her friend like her and her team claims. The black market in Hollywood isn‚Äôt really mentioned as much as sexual assault/rape but it is a huge problem ... now don‚Äôt quote me on this but certain elites and A listers can have people killed for different reasons .. it just gets darker and darker from here. 

This little story, of course , isn‚Äôt available to the general public. Obviously a celebrity‚Äôs team wouldn‚Äôt come out and say ‚Äúshe got her new kidney from the black market because she‚Äôs rich!‚Äù because that would not sit well with people.

Rape/sexual assault/sex trafficking/yachting/escorting all things that harm poor women who want to make a name for themselves. Pedophilia is rampant in Hollywood. 

Contracts with media outlets means that it‚Äôs hard for certain things to leak. Meaning certain celebrities with good publicists get away with things (ala Drake) . Industry control ; they shove in your face what to believe and who to believe.

Homophobia is rampant as well. Many women are advised to not come out as lesbian if they are so because their publicists want them to seem ‚Äúavailable‚Äù to men in the general public, sounds ridiculous but it‚Äôs psychology. Many women and men are closeted.

Know a certain celebrity who got a kidney transplant? They didn‚Äôt get it from a normal person. They got it from the black market. 

Elites can kill whoever they want if they are threatened by someone underneath them.
