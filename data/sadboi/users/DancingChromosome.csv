Basically, Selena Gomez’s team have put out the story and narrative that a friend of hers gave her , her kidney around 2018. They posted a picture of the 2 of them in hospital beds (classic staged photo). However the reality is that because Selena Gomez is an A lister, she has access to illegal things like the black market. In reality she got her new kidney from the black market - not her friend like her and her team claims. The black market in Hollywood isn’t really mentioned as much as sexual assault/rape but it is a huge problem ... now don’t quote me on this but certain elites and A listers can have people killed for different reasons .. it just gets darker and darker from here. 

This little story, of course , isn’t available to the general public. Obviously a celebrity’s team wouldn’t come out and say “she got her new kidney from the black market because she’s rich!” because that would not sit well with people. And how do I know this story? Well I do have sources from Hollywood , and no I’m not trolling or lying. No one has to believe me of course, but Hollywood *is* darker than the general public thinks, it’s just a matter of time."

AskReddit,fpovc2v,t1_fpnxngu,1588791285.0,"period. 

Rape/sexual assault/sex trafficking/yachting/escorting all things that harm poor women who want to make a name for themselves. Pedophilia is rampant in Hollywood. 

Contracts with media outlets means that it’s hard for certain things to leak. Meaning certain celebrities with good publicists get away with things (ala Drake) . Industry control ; they shove in your face what to believe and who to believe.

Homophobia is rampant as well. Many women are advised to not come out as lesbian if they are so because their publicists want them to seem “available” to men in the general public, sounds ridiculous but it’s psychology. Many women and men are closeted.

Know a certain celebrity who got a kidney transplant? They didn’t get it from a normal person. They got it from the black market. 

Elites can kill whoever they want if they are threatened by someone underneath them. 

List goes on."
