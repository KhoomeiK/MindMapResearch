And he has no right too put you down like that, it's your body not his! No partner, let alone fiancee, should do this too their partner, it's cruel and degrading! I'm not gonna go on a rant about ""YoU ShoUlD lEaVe hIm BlAh BlAh"" but you really do deserve too be treated well and with respect, and too be frank he sounds like a bit of a douche. Don't let what he said get you down, compare his one nasty comment too the amount of love and support your family and friends give you! It is totally okay too gain a little bit of weight and you should feel comfortable in your own skin, not feel uncomfortable due too someone who SHOULD make you feel lovely!"

Thank you for the advice on the jeans too, tbh the jeans i own are all hand-me-downs from my mum in the 90's and we had such different bodies i can't even get the over my bum and in my head that meant ""they'll suck everything in"". I will definitely change that and look for trousers that are more fitted too me rather than desperatly trying too squeeze into diddy clothing. Thank you! :)"
