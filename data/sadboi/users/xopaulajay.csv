selfimprovement,fhjinuc,t3_f35vhy,1581647158.0,"I hate exercise with a passion. Literally no part of it is enjoyable for me. I mean there the getting to the location of said exercise spot, which is a huge waste of time. Then you go rip your muscles apart for an hour which is painful and tiring af. Then you go home all weak and wake up sore af??? No thanks.

That being said, the only form of exercise I can stick to is ones where I‚Äôm tricking myself. Things that are fun that make me want to get stronger and nothing else. Fun sports like adult tumbling/gymnastics, acro yoga, ice skating, pole dance, rock climbing, tennis etc. you know, fun stuff that feels like playing!

Did you ever do sports when you were a kid? I competed in gymnastics and cheer so getting back into gymnastics and pole dancing has been great for me!"

relationships,fheeyww,t1_fhchs2q,1581520946.0,"Wow doing the bare minimum, how special! He sux...

If you want some REAL advice, I recommend non-verbal communication. It ALWAYS WORKS with dudes. Get BUSY! Start filling up your schedule. Go to concerts/shows with friends, take a new fitness class, and literally put him LAST in your list of priorities. Focus on yourself and stop putting so much of your energy into him. When he texts you in the middle of the day, ask yourself ‚Äúam I in the middle of something right now? I‚Äôll respond when I‚Äôm done with this and after I had lunch‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll respond after I get settled in and taken care of myself/my stuff‚Äù prioritize YOU. 

When he comes around asking what‚Äôs wrong or why you‚Äôve been so distant, simply tell him you were feeling unhappy/unfulfilled and have decided to make changes. That will put a fire under his ass. 

The only problem with this is that you‚Äôll never know if he‚Äôs suddenly bringing you flowers and lunch just because he‚Äôs afraid to lose you."

I consider myself conventionally attractive, usually ‚Äúthe hot friend‚Äù in the group. I got a lot of attention once I hit adolescence and it made me v self conscious because I was suddenly aware that people were noticing me & my outward appearance.

I‚Äôm 29 and struggling with the fact that even though I still have a long way to go, much of my identity is wrapped in what I look like and I don‚Äôt know what that means for me and my future as an elder/mature woman. 

I know I have an attractive personality and am a great person because it reflects in the relationships I have, but society has conditioned women to capitalize on their beauty/sex appeal and in a way we are influenced to believe that, that is the most valuable thing we have to offer.

So I don‚Äôt blame you at all. The struggles you are experiencing are 100% a result of your place as a woman in modern society.

Common interests are tough. He is into very typical masculine things and I with feminine things. I.e. sports vs creative/arts. We also tend to disagree on shows and music, unfortunately. But we find movies to watch together that we both might like.

Future plans, include buying a house in Scottsdale and moving there together in the next 1-2 years. However, I would need a LARGE commitment/gesture to just up and leave everything I know.

You are right and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on in her head and how her processing is. All I can go off is what‚Äôs on the outside. And to me she‚Äôs always been a high performer, highly organized, over achiever...in work only. So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm skeptical.

There seems to be a pattern of putting herself last in work & relationships and then finding ways to over indulge during her personal time with food, drugs, alcohol, sex etc.

Also the way she was diagnosed was pretty much her using adderall without a prescription, loving the benefits, then researching the symptoms and presenting this to her dr who gave her a prescription after a 15 minute phone conversation. Just seems a teensy bit shady. 

But I‚Äôm here trying to educate myself!"

She‚Äôs taken adderall without a prescription or diagnosis plenty prior. She is a very organized and highly productive person in work, she has even been told she‚Äôs high performing and exceeds expectations in annual reviews. 

But again, I‚Äôm not a doctor. I‚Äôm just here trying to gain insight and understanding."
