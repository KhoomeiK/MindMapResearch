There is a term called Keppra Rage (or lamotrigine rage) for this exact reason. She will have a very hard time controlling and recognizing her emotions for a while. Extreme exhaustion is common, headaches, and at times extreme dizziness. For me personally it took about 6 months to fully adjust, and it would seem I'm permanently a little more irritable but knowing the cause helps me respond appropriately. 

Some people have expressed adjusting just a couple months, I've met people where it took them a year. I'd say just read through the side effects together and be ready to work through them/with them for a while. Stress toys might help, or like myself they might make her further agitated."

Sleep and relaxation are essential to her healing, and sleep deprivation is one of the biggest common triggers for seizures.

As a kid Ioved the Beatrix Potter films (not the current ones but the originals) and for some movies I would recommend Ponyo, Castle in the Sky, Howl's Moving Castle, and The Secret World of Arietty (all Miyazaki films, even in action scenes they're full of sweet moments)

When I was a kid those movies really kept my focus, so even if it was just for a few hours, I'd really relax. You'll probably enjoy them too, I dont know anyone who doesnt.

Please feel free to PM me, I'd like to gift you a couple of the movies if you'll let me ‚ù§"
