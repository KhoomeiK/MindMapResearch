depression,fj2mlup,t3_fb6n84,1582947640.0,"Was in the same boat as you and was scared to take anti-depressants. My mum was firmly against them and actually said I’d have to move out if I decided to take them. But every medical professional I see (my GP and my psychologist) told me I should at least try them because they may be really helpful. So I’m currently on day 5 of Valdoxan (agomelatine) which is apparently an anti-depressant that has the least amount of side-effects and has no trouble getting off of it. I sleep a lot a lot better now like insanely so. I used to sleep at 3am and wake up 1pm but now I take Valdoxan at 8pm and fall asleep by 9:30pm to wake up at 8am. I also feel a little bit more alive if that makes sense. Like I’m actually in the world and connected to others. I haven’t noticed too much else but my family says I’m talking a lot more and seem a lot happier. I’m also enjoying things a but more and can concentrate a bit better. I’ve felt no side effects at all. 

To be honest, it is scary but give it a go. If within a week you feel worse let your GP know and they’ll probably prescribe you another med to try. But do try and tell someone you are so they can notice things that you may not. 

I wish you all the best :)"

I don’t have friends, I don’t have any hobbies or interests or anything that sparks joy or passion in me like it used to before. I do feel worthless and I do wonder what the hell I’m going to do if this is my life forever. Am I going to want to keep living? The answer is usually no. But somewhere, you know, there’s a really small part of me that has such excitement and hope for the future. It’s dumb; it’s stupid; it may be very misplaced. But I want to know. I want to know if I can make it in this world and overcome obstacles and be a much stronger person than I used to before. 

You deserve a good life; you deserve to progress. Sometimes we have to rely on external things to bring us joy because inside of us is unable to do that right now. Depression isn’t us; it isn’t who we are. It’s going to make it so much harder to think about things that once gave us joy because now the depression is going to make them feel joyless and dull. I’m not going to feel like myself or the person I used to know and at the moment I shouldn’t expect too; neither should you. 

It’s hard, it is but progress is very achievable for you. It’s just going to be hard. I know it feels like you can do nothing but you are smart; you typed this whole articulate post and expressed yourself well! Celebrate the small victories please. 

There’s no issue in relying on external things to make you happy because right now that’s what you CAN do. And that’s excellent and a right step forward. 

Always, always remember to be kind to yourself. Give yourself a break. You’re going through a lot but you’re killing it and you’ll be stronger for it. 

I wish you all the best."

Speaking about your problems and putting them out there like that and opening up will give you relief. You can go on knowing people have your back and it’s such a lovely, reassuring feeling to have that you deserve. As someone who dismissed their own feelings of depression and anxiety as ‘oh I just have nothing in my life that should be making me feel like this’ I absolutely fucking get it.
