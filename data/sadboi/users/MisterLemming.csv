hangovereffect,fl2bxjk,t3_fllw9m,1584747501.0,"This is probably unrelated but I spent several years as a nightly binge drinker, and every day  following that I felt phenomenal until about lunchtime, where I would begin to crash. I always assumed this was my ""hangover effect"".

Anyways, one thing that helped me immensely in my recovery was a drug called baclofen, which is a GABAb agonist. It produced similar relaxation effects to alcohol, and honestly it worked so well that several lifelong mental and physical symptoms seemed cured.

The reason I bring this up is because I have a strange reaction to this drug. Baclofen has been used for many years as a.muscle relaxant and experimented on for other treatments, and generally is very benign. It is safe to use as a treatment for alcohol withdrawal In that it is primarily metabolized in the kidneys. I have not been able to find a.single documented account of my type of reaction.

The drug seems to metabolize much slower in me than normal, and has a strange accumulation effect. So like I said initially it works amazingly, but after about a few weeks to a month it seems to accumulate to the point where it drives me psychotic (for lack of a better word), with no control over my emotions. Then I take a day or 2 off of it, and it returns to having intended effects. Baclofen has a short half life should be out of your system within 6 hours. I can reproduce this over 8 times with varying doses and times between doses.

I've been trying to figure out the reason for this for years, and why no one seems to have recorded this type of reaction.

I was just thinking due to your post, there might be some relationship between slow *metabolism* of alcohol as a GABAb agonist and this drug being a GABAb agonist.

Or I am just drawing parallels where none exist. Probably that."

For some reason also it takes 4 hours (on the dot) for me to feel the effects of baclofen, which makes mornings pretty brutal for me. I'm beginning to think that I might be a slow drug metabolizer, and the symptoms I am suffering might be due to the drug building up too much.

BPD looks different in males and females but the biggest consistent sign that I can figure is the concept of emotional permanence. That is, whatever you are feeling  at any given time feels like that's all you have ever felt. For example, if you are fighting with someone, and you feel anger, then it feels like that's all you have ever felt for that person.

I was in a similar situation and by the will of the gods I ran into a psychiatrist who was on the same page as me.

First of all I would get all the literature you can get a hold of to show this doctor. If they are still unwilling to budge, then there are other options.

You can order it online. It ain't cheap and probably illegal, but gotta do what you gotta do.

Also, Google ways to increase gaba. Theres plenty of natural ways to do it with vitamins, supplements, lifestyle changes. In my experience they help, but aren't as potent as baclofen.

And then what you suggested, taking the whole dose close together. That might help for sure, but you might see some kind of withdrawal in the morning. That's how it was for me. Having a meal before taking it is going to delay absorption.

I never went to a threshold dose, I hit 120 mgs and that did it for me. I take it to this day because it pretty much solved every mental and physical problem I've had over my life - unfortunately I'm having the same problem finding a doctor to prescribe moving forward.
