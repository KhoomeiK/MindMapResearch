opiates,f4ukhin,t3_dlsafd,1571814872.0,"I hope you can kick it my dude, I been 8 months clean from opiates. I was doing a lot of dope turned dope/fent xans and coke for years that got worse and worse an finally realized it was time. I left bags around for my family/friends to find subconsciously, I think. Tried to withdrawal an waited 30 hours before taking a bupe and went into severe precipitated withdrawal that lasted a LONG time. Took a few days to feel half way decent (was able to get FMLA at work) slowly starting on high sub long taper regiment. Iâ€™m down to 8 which is still high, but I still have a job. Family still up my ass, fortunately. You can do it man i know you can."
opiates,er2mzqc,t3_c02m2o,1560446328.0,"I was in a similar boat, on the verge of losing everything. I realized I had to stop and found a really good clinic that took me in (whilst in full withdrawal) and started me on 16 mg subs a day. Itâ€™s been a few months Iâ€™m down to 12. I go there once a week and take a drug test an they give me the subs. The taper process will take over a year, but I feel great I have my life back on track etc. I would highly recommend taking this route if you can."
