AskPhotography,fpikybt,t1_fpi2g8k,1588643071.0,Yes in manual mode I was able to take one. I can change aperture on the lense and speed on the screen. I should be set. Thank you.  What I like about the lense is the macro feature for close objects.
BipolarReddit,fpdezde,t3_gc9p3p,1588525683.0,"Mental health doctors, ive been told, dont diagnose minors with bipolar because of this problem. Anyone know this to be true?"
BipolarReddit,fpdbvl6,t1_fpb3t2w,1588523930.0,Does this work for federal employees? I work on a military base and the Stigma is alive and well. I feel sometimes im in a time warp back last century when we were all considered nut jobs. Hr doesn't know only the base hospital. I told them what meds I was taking after a work place accident. I am afraid of repercussions if  my shop finds out.
BipolarReddit,flr6o2f,t3_fqdink,1585414075.0,"I experienced what you described a lot. I never thought they were hallucinations from my mind. I use to think it was light or shadows, or flashbacks from my youth. I took hallucinogens recreationally. That might be why I dont freak out about them. Im sure if they get dangerous ill be concerned(people talking that aren't there, serial killers etc)

I have tinnitus and sleep with a white nose machine. In the noise I hear sometimes dogs barking, machinery, helicopters rain thats not happening and rarely people talking. Ive told the phscoligst several times about white noise stuff and he doesn't even comment about it. No one knows about visuals.

I hope things get better for you."

 My psychologist wants to add something for my highs and adhd medicine. I dont want to be totally medicated, so I  have resisted because the two work well and I have lorazepam for as needed for anxiety.  Hope they work for you long term as they did for me."
bipolar2,flh99ju,t3_fo59sl,1585158436.0,"I started with seroquel for sleep when we thought I just had GAD. Took awhile to get used to, but brain fog got less and less. Worked up to 200mg after bpd2 diagnosis and added Lamotrigine for mood,100mg twice day. Took me months to get to those doses. Combo works for me. My outbursts at work have minimized."
Coronavirus,flagrfn,t1_fl9x1p2,1584983556.0,"The federal government isn't even following its own guidelines. I work on military base its business as usual. I was tested Friday because i showed symptoms for respiratory infection. Negative thank god but i have to isolate 2 weeks. No gatherings of 10 or more, 15 people in shop stuffed in a small room. Nobody at fed level has a clue. During Government shutdown kicked me out the gate at a drop of a hat but Global pandemic we are essential personnel."
bipolar,fg3popj,t3_ewkzxa,1580486987.0,"Bipolar 2 here, seroquel 200mg,Lamictal 200mg a day. I smoke every day. Calms me,and helps shut me down for the night. Just had knee replacement so use for pain too. 
If you try again use Indica strains instead of Sativa. Some Sativa strains can cause pulse pounding highs. Stay away from concentrates until you get a tolerance."
BipolarReddit,ffwz09v,t1_ffrm5qw,1580314185.0,"Im on 200mg and 200mg seroquel at night. I always had something pushing on me my whole life. I can think before acting moe often, not 100%,but alot more than before meds. I'm new to Reddit so sorry about not replying sooner."
bipolar,ffwxkvc,t3_eve18t,1580313290.0,I had coping mechanisms for 30 + years before diagnosis. They stopped working after about  three years of marriage. Cant hide from my behavior when living with someone. Im on meds now and home and work are better.
bipolar,ffwwmph,t1_ffv5846,1580312687.0,I use those same apps they are great help especially the custom categories.
bipolar,ffwv911,t3_evfk5y,1580311797.0,"Pick your battles. Sometimes I can't handle debates about bipolar because of my bipolar. If they cause me to have a episode they win. I have to deal with general comments at work ""someone is bipolar because they're acting Crazy!"" So to them they are the same. If it becomes personal about me, I will defend myself. 

Remember, to keep reminding yourself,what they think doesn't matter. Its hard, because Our brains dont work that way all the time. Ignorance is hard to deal with"
BipolarReddit,ffr8e94,t3_euror8,1580152691.0,"Im still married because of Lamictal and my outbursts at work have stopped. It helps me Think before I act or speak. I also take seroquel so maybe the combination works for me, either way im better on the meds."
