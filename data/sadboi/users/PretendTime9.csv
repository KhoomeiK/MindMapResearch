mentalhealth,fc1c5yt,t1_fc1bz08,1577314372.0,"I don't know. I tried to get help. I went to the VA hospital and stayed there for 2 weeks. They never gave me a follow up and only prescribed me 30 days of Abilify, which didn't do anything. I went to my psychiatrist and he prescribed me an anti-depressant that did nothing for the voices. I even told my family to take me to the mental hospital. They told me to yell at the voices and tell them to get out. I feel like my support system failed me and I feel like I can't rely on anyone else but myself to avoid another relapse."

I have a mental illness and suffer from PTSD and I'm schizoaffective. I'm really looking for someone who can understand where I'm coming from, because I know stigma is a real thing.
