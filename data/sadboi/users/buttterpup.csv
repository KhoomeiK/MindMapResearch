gabapentin,fpdc73o,t1_fpdar99,1588524113.0,I was prescribed 1800mg (600 3 times a day) but almost always only took 1200mg. I tapered from late August to early October.
gabapentin,fpd9nt6,t3_gcnxjt,1588522671.0,"It isn't exactly dangerous, and is definitely a much better alternative to benzos. However it is still physically addictive and very hard to come off of when you eventually need to. Coordination issues and memory loss are the main side effects. I took it for 6 years and have been off of it since this past October. I slept hardly at all the first week, suffered extreme depression the first 3 or so months, and to this day I still sweat profusely, have pretty severe memory loss that I don't think will ever go away, and don't feel like myself. For me personally, the benefits I got from taking it were not worth the consequences I am experiencing now. Nobody ever told me how awful it was to get off of and I wish I never would have been prescribed it."
