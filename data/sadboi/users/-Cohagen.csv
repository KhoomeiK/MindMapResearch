Taking the time to be super creepy and slow wouldn't have fit the theme, although they did try to work in horror elements. There were parts here and there that were genuinely scary for me, especially the wife but she's a scaredy cat. 

I think they did well enough for the end of the series. It was a fun ride that I enjoy time and time again. Especially with the local co-op and mercenaries.
