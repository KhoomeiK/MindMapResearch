The humane society should be able to help you with cat food."
nashville,evfkh7t,t3_cjn1hh,1564497098.0,"http://nashvilleguru.com was helpful to me when I moved here a few months ago. Theyâ€™ll post about rent specials buildings are having, so I was able to move somewhere and have two months of free rent. Good luck!"
bipolar,etw47wq,t3_cdrdc7,1563253386.0,Way to go! You should be so proud of yourself for accomplishing this. Also I totally love your floral blanket.
nashville,ete4wc4,t1_ete3nc3,1562722997.0,Thank you for taking this time to explain this. Iâ€™ve always been curious and this is really helpful!
nashville,es8fw7p,t3_c67br0,1561696516.0,Iâ€™d be interested! I played a little bit in the past but itâ€™s been awhile.
nashville,es8f2xd,t3_c6amzf,1561695757.0,Check out Nashville Is The Reason on Facebook or Instagram. Theyâ€™re more involved in emo/ punk/ indie stuff but I do feel like theyâ€™re sometimes involved in putting on hardcore shows.
nashville,errmivj,t3_c3jfdy,1561175273.0,"Something I ordered online said it was delivered to my apartment the other day but was nowhere to be found. When I contacted FedEx they were useless and I was frustrated. Later that day, I get a random Facebook message asking me if I recently ordered something. Kind stranger went out of their way to find me and make sure I got my package. Made my day and reminded me that there are still good people in the world."

nashville,epkccnw,t1_ephr2p9,1559272109.0,"So much yes to all of your points!

- I think meetups would be great. I moved here a few months ago and havenâ€™t really figured out the best way to meet people here yet. 

- Your list is amazing! Thank you for sharing it. Honestly I aspire to get this organized with what shows are happening ha. 

- Also love MO! They just announced the Riot Fest lineup for this year and theyâ€™re playing. So stoked to see them."
