the amounts they get paid doesn't correspond to that inherently (and actually not at all). it corresponds to their socioeconomic power expressed in their ability to drain resources. it's not that elon musk coordinates a billion times better than a middle manager at costco, it's that he has a concrete socioeconomic standing that allows him to drain value through various institutions, like planctation owners did. there's no ""a billion times more usefulness and virtue displayed in musk or jeff bezos"" expressed ontollogically in a concrete from when he ""manages"" or in bezos. no, it's an expression of contingent social relations which allow him to drain the money. a lot of the rich don't work, and/or don't have to work to make money. a lot have inherited their fortunes. they don't even manage anything. they just sit on their asses and through the institutions of private property, capitalism, etc., they are allowed to drain work from the rest of society to enrich themselves.

I say americans are dumb not because they are literally dumb nor because all of them are like that, but because it's very common that talking to them is like talking to people living inside a bubble the whole time and who refuse to come out of it: they want to apply their categories to everything, can't see things from a different perspective, aren't interested in it, and their vision is unique and absolute. so for example, in here, you won't open yourself to other vision of how labor or the economy works: you'll circle around this supply side economics vision ignoring aaaallll the perspectives fromt he rest of the world and history: you don't even care most likely. 

also, i never insinuated that a society should provide without a workforce. there's a workforce right now. the economy is crashing because what's being produced and consumed is only the necessary and essential instead of all the waste. the resources are there to keep the economy ""shut down"" for a looooong time. but the leeches would need to learn to share. that's the only obstacle. they control 99% of the wealth. the resources are there. and again, people are indeed working. not everyone has to stop wroking. no one insinuated that."

Anarcho_Capitalism,fpwylh1,t1_fpwlfpf,1588972349.0,"indeed there are lots of facts you don't like. that's not what the paper is doing. Nor what I'm saying. Who said the soviet economy didn't stagnate and failed after the 70s despite having a bunch of resources? Who's not accepting such data? You are the one who doesn't seem to be able to accept that there's data that points to good things about the soviet economy. I can accept there were bad things, sure. Even that it was a net failure at the end. Can you see the good things?

pertinent data is in that paper. it's not cherrypicked. it's not something about which there's debate among economists, be them left or right. nothing that's controversial. It's all there. 

And of course things have value even when they don't adhere to your particular ideas and preferencs. Again, plenty of people remember that period as good, or as having good things that dissapeared with capitalism. (the introduction of capitalism to the country was made by brutally selling the country to capitalist gangsters and sending people into suffering, homelessness and suicide. And sabotaging the political system so that the communist party wouldn't be able to ever regain power despite what people would have wanted at some point. This is another fact.)

Why isn't appeal to a religious figurehead a valid argument? I'm not appealing to him as a religious leader of any kind, but as a rational and reasonable person and testimony,someone who actually lived under ""communist barbarism"": he saw the CCP destroy his country, his culture, the religion he professes, abused his people and even friends. The CCP would have probably executed him if he had stayed in Tibet. But as a reasonable rational person, he can see that it wasn't about communism as about a certain implementation of a communist idea. Why? Because it's very easy to see. You just need to read the work of MArxists and take a look at their ideals. 

>Of all the modern economic theories, the economic system of Marxism is founded on moral principles, while capitalism is concerned only with gain and profitability. (...) The failure of the regime in the former Soviet Union was, for me, not the failure of Marxism but the failure of totalitarianism. For this reason I still think of myself as half-Marxist, half-Buddhist.

The Dalai Lama is only an example. There are many other rational persons apart from him. You seem to really not like certain facts.

i'm sorry about your grandparents. but this isn't about them personally. People suffer a lot under captialism. Very smart persons wnd with nothing (and even worse) under this system becasue ""the market"" doesn't value their talents. the market won't value good or smart, only what sells."

same with insisting that persons take care of me. it isn't tyrannical at all. Again, people have lived like that for even more years: from the days before civilization and trhough all of it: recognizing various obligations towards others and from others to themselves for all of history. it's only until very recently that people in some places have began accepting such ideas of selfishness those are the antithetical ones. to most of humanity it sounds really dumb to say that being obliged to guarantee universal healthcare when it's possible is tyranny. it sounds really absurd. (And it is.)

About UBI, no comment. I don't know anything about the matter. (Tbf I doubt you understand the phenomenon well enough too). But in general, if you mean economic interventions aren't viable aand good. oh, yes they are. and they can be extremely successful. Examples can be found from socialist economis to capitalist ones all over history and all over the world."
