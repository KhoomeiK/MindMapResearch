The big question is, can you just enjoy sex as a journey and not put pressure on yourselves to come at all? Like maybe agree ahead of time that neither of you have to come at all, just see where it leads you. Like, one tip that helped me a lot was to focus on how good the sensations feel, and enjoy checking in about what level, 1-10, you are aroused at any time. If you or your partner ca n keep each other in the 7-8-9 range, that can be a fantastic experience.  Do you even need the 10? :)"

Level 1: just waiting for the other person to stop talking ap you can talk

Level 2: active listening, paying attention and internalizing the .message, and responding and showing the other person you are taking in their points

Level 3: empathetic listening: takes a lot of energy and focus, but focusing on the other person's frame of reference
