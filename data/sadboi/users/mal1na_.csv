BipolarReddit,f6ey5bi,t3_dqqu4x,1572808905.0,"first i wanna say that im so sorry for your loss. and its really important to know that it will get better. it wont be the same without him but it does get better. i would say to try not to stay alone alot, try to go out and socialize even if its hanging out with a friend, it may be hard but its harder to stay at home all by yourself when youre in that state of mind. try going to therapy also, it can help. surrond yourself with friends and family. id also like to add that time heals everything, be patient, go out, hang out with friends, etc...its very important to know that youre not alone in this also, you got this, and you can make it. alot of people love and care about you. it will eventualy get better. wish you the best of luck<3"
