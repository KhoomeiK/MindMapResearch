depression,f4u5arm,t1_f4u466a,1571799497.0,So like have thought about doing it or have u thought about what would happen as a hypothetical
depression,f4u4hya,t3_dlssik,1571798907.0,"Man I feel like a lot of us have felt what you feel like at some point and I know for a fact you won’t believe me when I say this, but ur really not as bad as u think. You are ur own worst critic, just bc u think u have no personality doesn’t mean that u don’t, and same for the ugliness. My cousin started balding at 20, is overweight, has glasses, and isn’t good lucking but he’s happy as shit with his girl rn. Looks aren’t everything and I bet u have a personality. What do u like to do? If u had a full day to ur self what would u do?"
depression,f4u44y6,t1_f4u3k0g,1571798643.0,Did u think abt it as a “what would happen if” or like as a serious thought
depression,f4u3xb6,t1_f4u3b29,1571798496.0,I think you need to have a real talk with her about this if it’s just ignorance. If it’s more than ignorance and she just doesn’t care then as bad as sounds there’s not much you can do and long term it would better to find someone who does understand but I get that’s not something u can just snap ur fingers and do
depression,f4u3eic,t3_dlsvkm,1571798129.0,If ur really desperate for touch and don’t mind spending money as ridiculous as it sounds there are people who u can pay to cuddle with u. If u want touch from like a loved one then yeah I would try ur regular social spots / online dating
depression,f4u39uw,t3_dlsuhn,1571798036.0,Is that it? Or have there been other symptoms? From just that I’d say no you’re just not afraid of what’s to come
depression,f4u31wr,t3_dlst9m,1571797879.0,"Man if she’s gonna leave you because of that it seems like that relationship should be over. If she loves you and cares about you, she’ll stay. If she doesn’t then it just means she’s not the one"
depression,f4u1z6a,t3_dlp6ws,1571797092.0,"Holy shit that’s where that’s from? I’ve been forgetting if I’ve taken my meds or snaps I’ve sent like 30min to an hour after, and I’ve had to rly think abt it in order to remember hell I couldn’t even remember when my last appointment was"
IAmA,f408a2k,t1_f407z23,1571288544.0,"I just updated it? And I messaged you guys about this already with no response, I mean you could at least try to contact me before just deleting the post"
IAmA,f407lz3,t1_f407gjv,1571287837.0,"So it was actually my idea to come to boarding school (I explained it a bit above) but yeah really both the campus, quality of education, and all the perks of living on campus. As for the last part I actually really dislike talking about my parents money, and most of the kids here are either on some form of financial aid or incredibly wealthy."
IAmA,f407h3s,t1_f406q26,1571287692.0,"I live about 2.5 hours away from my house and my parents are usually working out of state so I see them on our major vacations, i.e. thanksgiving, winter break, spring break, and over the summer."
IAmA,f407du8,t1_f406tp5,1571287600.0,"Okay to answer all your questions. My parents are both lawyers and they own a law firm, my dad makes most of his money through flipping properties/taking opportunities when he sees them. I have two half siblings from my dads previous marriage but my sister graduated college a long time ago and my brother suffers from some pretty severe mental handicaps. And boarding school was actually my idea, I liked all the perks of living on campus and thought colleges might look past my mediocre grades if I went to a good prep school."
IAmA,f40716k,t1_f406ojn,1571287240.0,I should also mention my school takes bullying incredibly seriously so anything that happens is usually mean sarcasm or ignoring someone
IAmA,f406yl2,t1_f406ojn,1571287167.0,"I’m incredibly average when it comes to popularity, (as in im not popular but people don’t hate me) so I’m not sure if it’s fair for me to answer but from I’ve seen I would say it’s generally less of a problem. An example would be an unpopular kid says something not funny and another kid would say “wow bro you’re so funny.” Pretty tame stuff."
IAmA,f406jyy,t1_f406dwc,1571286761.0,Don’t think I can help with that but good luck
IAmA,f406c8r,t1_f40670c,1571286549.0,"Not at all, so basically it’s like a regular highschool except there are dorms on campus and a large number of kids live on campus, it’s very similar to college."
IAmA,f406a3j,t1_f4063mu,1571286491.0,"(I’m away of this and I’m working on it right now)

My dad hasn’t told me his salary before but I know my mom makes about 750k on a good year, and he makes more than that

Edit: I realize how pretentious I come off saying this but I’m just trying to give the facts. In real life I hate discussing what my parents make."
Throats,f149lhe,t1_eyle58v,1569171356.0,Looks like felicity feline
