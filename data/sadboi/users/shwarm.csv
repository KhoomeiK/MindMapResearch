Maybe you can try being kinder to yourself? Getting rejected is super hard and also probably one of the bases why you have such problems in life. It is not weird to fall back after such things happen. 'The crazy' is probably coming back because it needs some love and gets into the old pattern of trying to get it - which doesn't work.

mentalhealth,fm1zp85,t3_fsjnc6,1585687952.0,"Hey there! Not everyone is feeling that same way. Being depressed is hard and it is often even harder to get out of it. Especially with low resources during these lockdowns everywhere.

Your feelings are legit. Even if everyone was feeling that way, it wouldn't make your situation and feelings any less real or difficult! Although you are not alone.

I personally have very good experiences with talking to professors about mental health. They often were very understanding and helpful about it. 

Also being stressed during things that should be enjoyable, such as gaming, resonates with me a lot at the moment... A thing that works for me during these times is working for school with Focusmate. It is a website where you let someone else watch you and you watch them while you work. So you can both use shame to be a motivator (because you would be ashamed if they would see you not work! (Also a good motivator to get dressed lol)) and help each other out of procrastination! Videocalling with a friend or playing a game together could also help.

Doing one little thing (even if the plan is to figure out what little thing you can do) could give you a little hope and self courage to maybe feel a bit better hopefully :) I hope you get help soon (edit: from school I mean, you said you have a psych) and feel a bit better"

AmItheAsshole,fk0gxqg,t3_fftqnb,1583756611.0,"NTA. I think you are setting healthy boundaries for yourself. You deserve to not be manipulated or hurt by your friend. It is true that it is hard for someone with BPD to deal with this kind of things. But he should not cross your boundaries, especially after you have made it clear that he is doing that. It can end up in an unhealthy way if you keep putting your friends feelings before your own well being.

If you are really good friends, you might go with him to therapy to talk about having appropriate boundaries? Maybe it can help as the therapist will help him deal with feelings that come up and let him act in a healthy instead of a toxic way."

I do think that the way you communicate it to them is not helping. By waiting and waiting for them to stop talking etc you are only making yourself crazy. ""Whenever you stay up late like this I sleep like shit"" sound really blaming and probably makes him feel shit. 

""I am only half nasleep anticipating you coming to bed"" When you send this so many hours later it also probably makes him feel shitty and he can't change it anymore because he didnt know on time. Did you tell him you wanted him to come to bed soon? How should he know that you wanted this? It sounds like you are expecting them to know exactly what you need (to sleep). And it sounds like they are trying to help you the best they can.

You could tell him that you need/want certain things so you can sleep. Like: could you be a bit more quiet, could you turn off a bit more light light, I would like you to come to bed and sleep with me because I wake up when you enter the room again. Could you do that for me? It is a kind way to set boundaries and get your needs met.

When you mainly state how he is bothering you it is more of an attack than a way that they can help you :)"
