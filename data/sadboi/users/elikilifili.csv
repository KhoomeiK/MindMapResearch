TooAfraidToAsk,fag9xeo,t1_fael3x5,1576045185.0,"> some people jump to wanting to transition because they don't fit the mold of what they think society expects of them

I think most people struggle with gender stereotypes & societal expectations at some point, especially during puberty, and that some young people in more liberal areas are exploring gender presentation and using labels like ""transgender"" because it adds legitimacy to what they're going through. I'm not exactly old & wise, but I'd wager that ""teenagers finding an element of their identity that they feel control over, then clinging to it like there's no tomorrow"" isn't really a new phenomenon. 

Also, pardon me if my language comes off as rude but I'd say a whole lot of people still care about gender roles; sure maybe no one really cares if you like fashion shows and can't change a tire, but try going out in heels & a full face of makeup in the middle of Ohio and let me know how it goes. We might have gotten over the shock of men watching romcoms and  women wearing jeans, but gender roles are alive and well in a lot of people's minds.

Also, gender dysphoria is very different from a man not liking muscle cars or a women not liking makeup. A definition that I like is ""a marked incongruence between \[an\] individual's expressed or experienced gender and that which was assigned to the person at birth... \[which\] causes clinically significant distress or impairment"" (from this 2013 paper: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10615-013-0447-0](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10615-013-0447-0)). There's a lot of research surrounding gender dysphoria and how it should be dealt with, if you're interested in learning about that sort of thing ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0140-7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0140-7),  [https://www.nature.com/articles/nrurol.2012.182](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrurol.2012.182), and [http://www.obrela-journal.gr/index.php/obrela/article/view/110](http://www.obrela-journal.gr/index.php/obrela/article/view/110) seem like good places to start but I'm very much not an expert lol)."

What being a man ""means"" to me is that I don't have to think about my gender. Before coming out I experienced a lot of stress surrounding my gender (feminine features, a female body, a feminine name, the expectation that I'd bear children, etc.). The biggest difference that hormone therapy/transitioning has made is reducing that stress; it's less like going from ""wrong"" to ""right"" and more like going from ""issue"" to ""no issue"".

That rambling thing is to say that I don't explicitly ""feel male"", I just feel ""not female"". Presenting as a man (and having male hormone levels) just gets rid of that discomfort."
TooAfraidToAsk,faelrqd,t1_faees4y,1576003301.0,"I'm not sure that people are willing to let others just present as they want.

I can't go to family events without some relative asking me why I would choose to look so masculine.

I certainly wish that I'd realized that I was trans earlier, but tbh it was difficult for me to come out when I did (moved out when I was 17 and came out a few months ago) and I didn't really have the resources to transition until now. Hah, as happy as I am to have started T I still wonder if I would have been better off if I'd come out later. It seems perfectly reasonable to me that even if someone is completely secure in their identity (which is a feat in and of itself) they might stay in the closet until they move away from restrictive family/community, and maybe even for a while after that until they are financially able to transition."
