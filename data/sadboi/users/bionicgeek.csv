AskScienceFiction,exvvf3d,t1_exv19sx,1566607452.0,"This is basically what I was coming to say. Within the overall study of Realmatic Theory, the planet of Sel is interesting given that Odium Splintered both Devotion and Dominion, creating a rather uniquely diverse set of localized magic systems deriving from that Splintered power being concentrated and trapped in Shadsmar/Cognitive Realm. Given the fact that Intent is still a mysterious but key component of any Cosmere magic system, it is very probable that certain forms of Devotional intent are required to access the energy, the Dor, created by the chaotic mix of Dominion and Devotion's powers. It should be noted that the Dahkor Monks probably are drawing through more of Dominion's power. As for Soulstamping, I'm not sure, I think that might draw equally purely from expressions of the Dor.
