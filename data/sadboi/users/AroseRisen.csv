My friendcode is 2638-6481-5066. I just reset my town earlier today after not having played for years, so what I need the most help with is collecting enough bells to upgrade my house and to pay for the Public work project cobblestone bridge, but if bells aren't something you're looking to donate, a furniture item that I really like would be any things roccoco! 😁"

ketorecipes,esp7cq9,t3_c8rykt,1562180001.0,"My first attempt, and it turned out AMAZING.

Recipe~

Ingredients:

1 head cauliflower, stalk removed

3/4 cup grated Parmesan

1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 

1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 

1 teaspoon garlic powder 

2 eggs, lightly beaten



Directions:

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Break the cauliflower into florets and pulse in a food processor until fine. Steam in a steamer basket and drain well. (I like to put it on a towel to get all the moisture out.) Let cool.

In a bowl, combine the cauliflower with the Parmesan, oregano, salt, garlic powder and eggs. Transfer to the center of the baking sheet and spread into a circle, resembling a pizza crust. Bake for 20 minutes.

Add desired toppings and bake an additional 10 minutes."
