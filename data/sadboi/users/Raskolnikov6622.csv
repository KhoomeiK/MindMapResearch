bipolar,fmkrppz,t3_fvsvxl,1586166033.0,"Tried to join the arrmy to be a chemist and and pharmacist to develop bio and chemical weapons. Convinced myself to work out 2 hours daily, learnt english, spanish, german and sign language, extended my pharmacology and toxicology courses (from college) to military use. Went to geo-political and history classes and tried to learn all i could about the art of war and strategy. 

All of that while still going to college and having a part time job.

It lasted for about 6 months before I realized that hypo-episode was driven by a strong will to leave my home town and family who I considered toxic at the tile, more that an actual passion. 

(I still love pharmacology and toxicology tho but I came back to my original dream which is lab work, and clinical research on psychiatry and psychoactive substances). 

I could say that was a pretty good period as I grew a lot and learnt lot and lot of stuff but i nearly didn't sleep at all during all those months and lost a chance to build a relationship with a girl i liked at the time, always telling her I had no time for her as I was needed to solve the ISIS situation."

BipolarReddit,fmjfgvg,t1_fmjbgik,1586129264.0,"Well i'm a Bipolar II so it rarely occurred for me to have a fullblown mania or hallucinations, except when over using drugs (some of them are listed above and that's why i remembered them clearly) but  when i smoke i often get delusional and have psychosis ( pretty quickly like after 2 to 3 joints). . 

Whenever that occurs, there is always some part of me that knows something is wrong and that all that stuff is being made up by my mind, like being in a lucid dream and knowing you are in a dream.

That forces me to act normal so people actually don't notice what's going on inside and don't think of me as a crazy dude. 

In nightclub or big parties like raves and festivals i can just be in my world and dance, or express some of those thoughts, mostly because people under the influence are more open to ""weird behaviours or conversations"" and would put that under the ""he's is way too drunk"" category. 

But when smoking in small groups, with friends or people i just met most of the time the end result is just me being silent and looking at people or in the void without moving too much nor really reacting to what's going on. It's impossible to keep up a conversation in that state though as i go back and forth between my disillusionment and reality. 

(my best friends know me enough to see in my eyes and behaviour when i've lost tack of reality, pretty glad for that because i feel like i have a safety net for when i completely loose track of what's real or not) 

I've always asked myself how people who smoked the same amount or more were dealing this kind of thing. It took me a therapist to actually understand that it was not a normal thing to experience when smoking weed but it was just me, being bipolar and incompatible with it."
bipolar,f7oq5zi,t3_drmli2,1573931828.0,"got my psychiatrist appointment, definitely is psychosis.
Don't know how to describe them but it's like they're here whenever i'm alone,sometimes telling me what i have to do or not, or what to think, most of the time under the form of a question. My thoughts just become a full socratic dialogue with as many characters as my psychosis is ""high"", most of them are right, some are wrong but i rarely get the chance to be part of that conversation.
i've been prescribed risperidone 4mg daily, which helps dealing with it but sends me more easily into depression.
I'll be seen the doc in two weeks to see how it goes with the new m√©decine."
bipolar,f5gu63z,t3_dnqecp,1572197162.0,"Not since i've been on medication (depakote 1000mg a day). I use to day dream a lot, which made it difficult to know what really happened and what didn't. That nearly stopped with the treatment but left me with a lot of free time and massive doubts about my life. 
Try not to focus on this, take it like you would with real dreams, put it asideand just start doing actual stuff. 
Unless it took over your social life then try to consider thoses as lies and telle the truth to your close ones. 
No one wants to lie to the ones they like"

Switched to 5mg a day, helped a lot with the moodswings and the voices in my head without the side effects from before. I feel like my emotions are still numbed a bit but i'm way more stable than before."
