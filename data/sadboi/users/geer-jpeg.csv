Netherlands,fqteejc,t1_fqtdttx,1589637305.0,"In my experience, this really depends on the city and how many people are already in the crisis care, same for the basic mental health queue. In some cities people get help within two weeks, in other cities its two to three months.

I've had to wait for six months for the specialised health care and for the aftercare, aka basic GGZ I was told the queue was at least two months before they could speak with me for the intake.

And the crisis centre has sent me away some times due to; ""No more beds available, sorry. Good luck surviving the night!""

I don't mean to discourage anyone to get help or rain on someone's parade, but unfortunately the reality is that the queues have been getting longer for a very long time and now so many people get stuck in their heads and need the mental healthcare even more, but there aren't enough therapists available and it's a loooot of trouble taking care of all the paperwork with all the different instances being involved so it's going to be a longer wait than is acceptable"

It's my personal belief that rom-coms, chick-flicks and YA movies and books have made us all deeply insecure about being alone and needing someone else in order to be valuable as a human being. The most important thing is to find peace within yourself, and learning how to be happy with the person that you are. Yes, it's gonna be difficult, to be honest I think it's a lifelong journey, but at the end of the day you're the one who has to deal with yourself all the time. Best spend time on making sure you're happy with who you are, right? Because how else can you offer someone who you wholly are when you don't even know who you are?

Regarding the famous people crush; it's best if you discuss this with your therapist/psychologist/whoever you're talking to to help you get by. It's not something that we as strangers here can truly help you with. I think it's important for you to find out why you think this is going to happen, and what you believe is valuable in the whole scenario.

relationship_advice,fi6myx5,t1_fi60v6c,1582201565.0,"I can understand why someone would get upset over this, but if my boyfriend decides he wants to move in together with his best friend, whom he has known longer than he knows me, I wouldn't have an issue with that. If I do get upset over it, it's because of my insecurities about his love for me. It has nothing to do with his best friend, and all with me.

It's okay to voice your concerns and say when something makes you uncomfortable, but in this situation you are essentially saying you don't trust your SO and therefore you are justified in your concerns. Which, to me, means you should sit down with your SO and have a conversation, and say that you are feeling uncomfortable, insecure, and jealous and that you'd like to work through them together, rather than forcing your SO to break off a friendship."
mentalillness,fi6mgyf,t3_f6ruxa,1582201074.0,"Please don't give up. Maybe this specific therapist isn't for you, or this form of therapy.

I can only speak from my own experiences, and what I have learned is that there are many different types of therapy. You can see a therapist once a week, but I think that won't be enough for you. I'd recommend seeing if there is a mental health facility where you can be admitted, since your problems are severe and deeply interwoven in your life and personality.

My guess is that you have experienced trauma, and subsequently developed PTSD. PTSD doesn't mean having panic attacks all the time, it also entails deep rooted negative thoughts about yourself and the world, struggling to form real connections, feeling removed society, avoidance(again, this entails much more than just not doing a thing/going to a thing that reminds you of your trauma), and it can cause suicidal thoughts.

My recommendation for you is to find a mental health facility that can help you get the proper diagnosis, and the correct help. I have walked around with PTSD for the majority of my life, and I've been misdiagnosed so many times before some major stuff happened that forced me to go to a PTSD clinic. It wasn't until I went through the intakes that I learned I've had PTSD for years, and that was what gave me all of my other issues and caused me to be misdiagnosed.

Best of luck to you, and you are always welcome to message me."

Een simpele depressie of een klassiek geval van PTSS is makkelijker te herkennen volgens de DSM, makkelijker te behandelen en goedkoper. De meeste instellingen verlangen van je dat je stabiel bent op het moment dat je in behandeling gaat, maar je kan pas stabiliseren wanneer je behandelt wordt.

Ik ben in die zin de geluksvogel dat er nu CPTSS gediagnosticeerd is en dat ik in een maand mag starten, maar voor het zover was ben ik jaren tussen wal en schip gevallen en was er niets dat de instanties voor me konden doen- niet zonder mijn felbegeerde plek op de wachtlijst op te geven."

But know, the pain will fade. You faced today head on, wearing a beautiful, bright smile that lights up my screen. You have the heart of a warrior, being able to smile like that after such horrible pain.

Be proud of yourself, you've made it through so many days already. You can do this. I believe in you."

Thank you guys so much ✨ Honestly, I have read each and every single comment several times, and they have brought a smile to my face every time.

I know I haven't responded to everyone- there are only so many ways to say thanks! But please know I have read your words, I appreciate them deeply and I will read them whenever I'm in need of some lovely toast.

Last; thank you for the silver(have I graduated from Reddit Uni now?)!"
