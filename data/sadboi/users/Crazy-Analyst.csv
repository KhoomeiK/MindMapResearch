You stopped all your meds? Did you consult with your p-doc?

Not that it might happen to you, but it is my experience. When I was pregnant in between my two live births, my p-doc, who I fired, took me off my meds. I got extremely depressed and unstable. I lost the baby at 10 weeks. I’m convinced that it was at least partially because of the depression and my inability to care for myself.

I took an SSRI with my first, and lamotrigine with my second. Both have low risk vs benefit. Both kids are healthy.
