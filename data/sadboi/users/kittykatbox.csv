BPD,fpuuwdc,t1_fputwwr,1588924543.0,"What you are saying is irrelevant regarding her being a mod because she said she didn't distinguish her comment as a mod. Once again, mods are allowed to make mistakes just like the rest of everyone on the sub. They are allowed to exist *just as users* on the sub. All of the mods are held to the same standards. I have already said this. 

I did not express agreement with you that her comment was out of line, nor did I say it was bad behavior. Expecting people to stay silent when they're being insulted or harassed is ridiculous. Calling their reaction or response ""bad behavior"" is unfair. By your logic, because we have rules based on etiquette and being kind to others, when someone is mean to somebody else, they should be quiet and not say anything in defense of themselves.

Regardless of the fact that we would remove the comments if they devolved into back and forth insults, people are allowed to defend themselves and their discourse. You took what u/ywont wrote and assumed she was calling the other user uneducated and ignorant, but u/ywont clarified that she was referring to their knowledge on the subject. If u/ywont had taken it further and behaved aggressively or insulted the other user, it would have resulted in removals, just like how we handle the rest of the content on this sub.

I have had my fair share of bad interactions with users and have had other mods step in and moderate my comments. So have other mods. We keep one another in check. Please do not assume we are somehow above the rest of the community just because one comment chain went unchecked (the onus is on the reader, also, to report rule-breaking content so that the mod team can take care of it). We aren't better or worse than anybody here."
BPD,fputpz7,t1_fput0wu,1588923386.0,"I'm surprised you're telling a mod to be courteous and respectful when the comment you referenced by u/ywont mentioned that the user she was replying to was insulting her in the first place (re: *""attacking me personally""*). Do you expect moderators not to be human and falter when harassed and abused? 

As well, she stated that she wasn't distinguished. If a user had an issue with her comment at the time, it was fair game to be reported. It can't be helped that other mods weren't aware of the interaction. We aren't perfect beings, but we do our best to adhere to the rules for the community just like everybody else.

u/ywont was as courteous and respectful as she could be, she can't be blamed if her words are misconstrued. Honing in on one mistake is disingenuine."

Even though this isn't a research study, you're approaching the subreddit as though it is. If you had intended to ask questions like this, it would have been great if you had contacted the mod team first.

Regarding Rule 2, it's plain rude to ask a group of users suffering from a mental illness to explain their mental illness to you. That is what Wikipedia and other encyclopedias exist for, friend. There are plenty of research articles that have been published to scientific and academic journals regarding BPD.

Sure, it's not like it hurts anybody, but it's also not something you'd share with people and most people might not know how to interact with that kind of thing.

I think 'self-discovery' social media content should revolve around loving oneself and speaking of one's journey, and knowing when and what to share regarding that. You can tell your story without telling everyone everything. When I decided it was time to love myself and put myself first, I quit social media, instead of declaring to everybody how much I loved myself. 

Ask yourself why you want to tell everybody personal information about yourself. Ask yourself why you think anybody on your follower or friend list need to know any of these details about yourself. Ask yourself if it is even necessary to do any of this. Social media is a plague and it can suck the life out of you, figure out what your true intentions are, don't fall for the subtle manipulation of social media trends."
BPD,fnja4ke,t1_fn8ezmr,1586994883.0,"The symptoms for BPD are very easy to mistake with symptoms of other conditions or, the most popular one, symptoms of puberty. This is why people under the age of 18 do not and cannot be diagnosed with BPD. Relating to the symptoms of a mental illness is not the same as actually having and struggling with the diagnosis. 

You can experience dissociation and not have BPD, likewise, you can have unstable relationships or fear of abandonment while not having BPD. This is also why you must have at least 5 out of 9 of the symptoms to be diagnosed. 

Being diagnosed with BPD is not really the same, for example, as being diagnosed with bipolar or depression. Depression and bipolar are mood disorders; thus, when diagnosed, it is taken into consideration whether your symptoms last for extended periods of time. 

With BPD, your symptoms can vary in degree, intensity, and in combination throughout your life, which are all based on your environment, treatment, and other factors. Typically there is a pattern of these symptoms and prolonged behaviors, but BPD is not a mood disorder, it is a personality disorder (actually that term is misleading, but there is a difference between these types)."

I couldn't follow what happened since the post was deleted and I didn't understand what was happening, but what I did see was that you wrote about how the post was triggering to you. Which is fair and valid, but if that was the case, going on about it *on* that post was somewhat inappropriate. It seems to have made the OP feel like they were doing something bad, felt ganged up on (because other users piled on), and finally humiliated for sharing and asking for help. 

But since I don't understand the context very well and came in late, I could be off-base. I saw the distress that the OP was experiencing and I think that it was just a bad situation all-around. Though you clearly were not intentionally trying to do this, you ended up policing OP. 

So you know, this is why, actually, there are moderators for forums. It's so that when something seems off or is breaking a rule, someone outside of the situation can take care of it without causing an OP to feel ashamed. If users police each other, a lot of bad feelings can get mixed in, if that makes sense, and things can get messy quickly. Hopefully that makes some sense."

Instead of telling all of the other mods here that they need to learn how to be empathetic, and instead of telling the other mods that they need to be removed bc they don't know how to mod, remember that you're talking to people who likely also struggle with BPD and are moderators of a BPD forum. If you haven't moderated this subreddit and aren't willing to try, it might be wise not to judge others, even if they're making mistakes. 

This is the most difficult forum I've personally ever had to moderate, and that's not an overstatement. The userbase can be extremely ruthless, uncaring, and unempathetic to the fact that we are also humans behind the screen. Mods are prone to making mistakes, too, and we can't always be perfect. We do our best every day to serve this community and to make it a supportive place (*not* a safe place) where people can receive advice (preferably not sugarcoated) and learn about BPD. 

You all don't see what happens behind the scenes, and thank goodness you don't, because it's a lot worse than what you see when you see a mod make a mistake, either with their content distinguished or undistinguished. We deal with it because we care for the community, not because it's easy or because we find it to be a fun thing to do on the side."

(not to mention the environmental benefit from animals pasturing as opposed to being locked inside a cage all day... rip I'm so passionate about this lol)"
ParentalAlienation,fmdlsrh,t1_fmc4d0p,1585971144.0,This is what I've discovered for my own personal situation. I grew up with a narcissistic mother who alienated me from my dad and my extended family on my dad's side.
UnsentLetters,fmdfo6v,t1_fmd1ufo,1585966628.0,"She should just be *single*, bc she's clearly insecure as fuck and lacks honesty and communication skills!!! Grrr, this post boils my blood."
UnsentLetters,fmcz5y3,t1_fmcz01z,1585955838.0,"it's so sad seeing the way she describes her love for this guy and then in the same breath says she loves her husband... No, you don't love your husband, not if you're hurting him this way. This is hard for me to stomach. Also 95% certain this is lust, not love, lol"
UnsentLetters,fmcywrf,t1_fmcxjwz,1585955685.0,"Thanks! I forgot it was my cake day actually. 

I think that anybody who willingly cheats is seriously insecure and lacks communication skills. That's my 2c!"
UnsentLetters,fmcw7f0,t1_fmccjoy,1585954063.0,"in that same post she said ""I'm not a cheater, I love my husband"" lol"
raisedbynarcissists,fm9om9e,t3_ftkl00,1585873097.0,"I feel this, my mom always had to live vicariously through me. It's like I came into this world as a replacement version of herself. She's always made everything about her and consistently had to make any achievements of mine somehow very weird and awkward."
raisedbynarcissists,fm9o54i,t3_ftqeji,1585872801.0,"It makes me both happy and sad to see that there are others who have struggled similarly to me. 

My mom never cooked for me, but when she did, it was always for herself first, so it was never anything a kid would enjoy eating. I ate a lot of microwave meals and junk food. I actually can't eat any kind of microwave food anymore because I get really sad, and I kinda get flashbacks to bad memories. 

Thank you for sharing and starting this discussion, I don't feel as alone in this."
BPD,fkp0hbe,t1_fkoz4ba,1584399044.0,Asking for an *opinion* is still asking for medical advice/'diagnosis' no matter how you word it. We can't tell you whether you exhibit the symptoms of BPD or not. You must speak with a professional in order to gain clarity on your mental health. Removed due to Rule 4

StLouis,fknukr8,t3_fjawws,1584374227.0,I've been playing Stardew Valley for 3 days straight. I recommend it to anybody who likes games similar to Harvest Moon!

StLouis,fkhouqv,t1_fkhncix,1584203190.0,heck yes! Cake is worth it.
StLouis,fkhos7b,t1_fkhn9u7,1584203152.0,"Oh! I meant to put that on my list, too. Thank you for linking it!"
StLouis,fkhlxyp,t1_fkhkus7,1584201605.0,"Here are some I've been to and recommend: 

* Sweet Divine in Soulard

* Whisk on Cherokee

* La P√¢tisserie Chouquette on Tower Grove Ave

* SweetArt

* the Cup (I think they do cakes? I haven't been in a while)

I'm sure there's more I could add, but hopefully that helps a bit!"
StLouis,fkhk6cb,t1_fkgfn9e,1584200623.0,"Right, and most businesses won't stop what they're doing until someone of authority tells them otherwise (and maybe not even then)."
