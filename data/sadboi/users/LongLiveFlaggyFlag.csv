UCONN,fqdxmmd,t3_gi24cj,1589298363.0,"For Honors Cell Bio, one of the things I struggled with the most is making sense of scientific articles. To get yourself more familiar, maybe find a scientific article in the field that interests you every week or so and look up the different techniques. As someone who took biochemistry lab after cell bio and haven't done much bench research, I had no idea what was going on in those papers that you actually need to understand the gist of because they sometimes tested us on how well we understood assigned papers. I have no advice on other tips for understanding scientific papers though because I'm still not great with them lol, sorry :( My best guess would be that if you can find a journal club somehow, people smarter than me could help explain what's going on in a paper? 

Also as a heads up, if they haven't changed the course structure, then quizzes and tests should still be take home, but participation was super important in that class so staying attentive and asking questions every class could help your grade.

For orgo, maybe Khan academy? I took orgo with Bailey and he recommended that you do every single problem in the book so you could start on that too. Not sure about your general stress levels though so I would also consider just chilling on some days instead of orgo and cell bio prep so you don't burn out because orgo will definitely be making you work hard all the time in the fall.

Hope that helps!"

UCONN,fpf4go9,t3_gd1lh1,1588561559.0,Honestly HDFS 1060 Relationships Across the Lifespan has taught me some interesting stuff despite being a class I only took because everyone says it's pretty lowkey in terms of workload.

It was not fun picking classes at orientation not knowing if my major change request was approved, especially since they put me with an advisor from my original major.

UCONN,fmduygy,t1_fm8lc21,1585978786.0,"Sorry I haven't taken any of those classes so can't help with those. If there's not much on those in this sub, you might be able to find more on ratemyprofessors since people sometimes talk about course structure on there. I would recommend taking online reviews with a grain of salt though since it's generally people who are really angry or really happy. Based on my time at UConn so far, I have had maybe one or two not great professors and two not great TA's, but other than that I've liked the majority of them (especially some of my TA's were just hands down awesome both in lab and during their office hours). As a STEM major, I've found the workload pretty doable after getting the hang of things. My advisor helped me mix in easier gen eds with my harder science classes, which also helped a lot. For me, it's been a mix of balancing academics while also working on my time management because I love extracurriculars.

If you live on the coast in NJ, the weather is either colder or warmer since Storrs is in-land. Other than that, I guess it's like normal New England weather? Sorry ik that's super not helpful I've lived in Connecticut for most of my life. Because of how campus is set up though there's some wind tunnels so I personally give up on an umbrella when it's super windy and raining bc it's just going to break lol.

There's definitely a ton of opportunity for research. I would let your advisor know during your first meeting that you're interested and what areas you're interested in. It's likely that they would know professors to connect you with. Other ways are to visit your professors during office hours to talk about their research and for any tips. There's also the Office of Undergraduate Research that can help you out as well as lots of seminars/lectures where people come in to talk about their research. Off the top of my head, I know inCHIP usually has a Thursday series every semester. One thing I highly recommend is to visit the Center for Career Development to get your resume critiqued before sending it out when asking about research. 

Hmmmmmm I guess if you can fit one in your car on the way up to school, I recommend bringing a comfier chair than the ones they provide in the dorms. If not, many of my friends brought seat cushions. I think almost all dorms have these wooden chairs that are not comfortable to sit on at all (pics of them on the Reslife 360 dorm views). Dorms also don't come with lamps so would suggest bringing one of those too. Rainboots are nice on days you have to walk around in the rain. Figure out what trip home you can make to bring snowboots iirc NOAA has a map with the historical first snowfall of the year. Also heads up that the rec center has towels if you shower after working out, but definitely bring a pair of shower shoes. If you plan on working a part-time job, it's a good idea to bring any I-9 documents since photocopies aren't allowed. With that in mind, you don't need a lock for the lockers at the rec center but you might want to get one for the desk in your dorm if you'll have important things in there. Also if you get sick and can't go home, there's an in-patient unit at Student Health that providers can admit patients into. Sorry I'm not out-of-state so that's the extent I can think of rn."

UCONN,fmbgc0f,t1_fm8anv4,1585925793.0,"Try to utilize that gap after MCB 2610. Could either be going to the gym to give your brain a break (also good idea to exercise before eating) or going over what you just went over in lecture highlighting or whatnot. MCB 2610 and PNB 2264 are not classes that you can just remember everything after hearing it once. The profs in PNB 2264-65 try to record all their lectures so I would recommend relistening since it forces you to sit down and review material. In general, it's a good idea to have recurring study blocks. I didn't take orgo with Howell but in most orgo classes it doesn't hurt to do all the practice problems in the book. 

Both MCB 2610 and PNB 2264 labs have quizzes so make sure to review the lab before. PNB 2264 prelabs are usually due Monday at 11:59pm so fit doing the prelab into your schedule the same time every week. Also try to do the post-lab at the same time every week. Sometimes that might be right after lab but also the lab slides don't get posted until Friday or so and I usually look at those while doing post-lab questions.

I know that was a lot but also make sure to schedule in breaks either by going to the gym, going to club, just chilling out and watching YouTube, etc here and there so you don't burn out. Something I do is write in all of my exam dates in my calendar during syllabus week so I have a better sense of what week is going to be hard before. Also, set an alarm for when you should be going to sleep. Sleep is so important I can't stress enough how it makes you more productive and can help you do better in school and just a whole bunch of other health benefits.

Hopefully that helps good luck!

Edit: sorry if that sounded bossy/snobby did not intend to make it sound that way!"
UCONN,fmbeksp,t3_ftzskv,1585924767.0,For real though even the course structure in general is set up to help you.

Miss his anatomy memes :(
UCONN,fmbdwqm,t3_fu7uos,1585924371.0,"I love it at UConn because the student body is so active in bettering things around campus and around the world. There are so many efforts for mental health, a more sustainable environment, etc as well as just so many clubs (my favorite are the Outing Club, Beekeeping Club that usually has honey sticks at the involvement fair, and the Homies that are a group that supports the Homer Babbidge Library).

As many others have said, it honestly doesn't matter where you go if you are planning on getting a higher degree after your Bachelor's so you're better off going to wherever has the cheapest tuition. I did this and am really glad I did because 1) I really like it at UConn and 2) the lower tuition helps out my family financially and significantly lowers our stress as a whole (especially now that I'm saving even more money living off-campus). It also gives us more of a safety net because the money that I save by picking a lower tuition school means more money for other areas like healthcare or for our emergency fund. I still work a part-time job on campus though and even there I have fun and have made lots of friends. Plus there are some jobs that might directly have to do with the field you're going for like the Student Activities Business Office has student workers who help with processing transactions for student club bank accounts.

Edit: Also I have noticed quite a few people from my high school who picked other schools ended up transferring to UConn. Not really sure what their story is, but maybe someone else has some more insight on transferring in?"

UCONN,flnktns,t3_fprbi5,1585320693.0,"Not a SLHS major, but in Allied Health so some similar gen eds. If you're in honors, take honors gen chem and don't take honors bio (ignore if not in honors lol). Can't speak much about Abbott in bio because I got ECE credit in high school. If gen psych is a requirement, expect to take it even if you got AP credit. At least from when I was a freshman, you get credit for AP psych but only as a ""1000-level"" while my major requires PSYC 1100 so I had to retake psych. If you did well in AP psych though, then PSYC 1100 (Lundquist brings his dog Pluto in) can serve as a GPA booster. Allied Health isn't in CLAS so I'm not sure what other gen eds you would have. If orgo is included though, orgo is hard no matter what lol.

As for dorms, it depends on your luck. Whenever I went random for roommates, I had not great luck and now I live off-campus also for cost reasons. Reslife has a 360 view of what each of the dorms look like on their website that I found helpful. Generally, freshmen are in Towers (Honors in Buckley or Shippee) unless you're in a learning community. If you want a really nice room, join a learning community in Werth. I did not live in the most luxurious dorms (aka South/Hilltop apartments/Werth) but I did enjoy living in a dorm minus my roommate since I made a lot of friends and it's nice not having to drive. I personally also liked to study in the dining halls, which I can't really do so much now.

Hopefully that helps a bit lmk if you have other questions!"

It also helped me feel a little less alone and ignored when I think of it as everyone else also has stuff going on and are busy with their classes and extracurriculars. I used to get sad when my friends couldn't grab a meal with me, but then once I got busier and had to turn others down for getting together, I realized it's often just a time conflict and not because people don't actually like me. I'm by no means a professional though and have gotten help with getting my life together from going to office hours and sometimes going to the free consultation drop-in hours at CMHS. (CMHS has consultation drop-in hours every week day if you are able to fit that in your schedule.) A great way to lower test-taking anxiety is to go to office hours and get help from a TA or professor.

UCONN,exkflrp,t3_ct63kx,1566387815.0,"I'm not too familiar with DMD, but would it be possible to do a minor? I decided to go for a minor instead of double majoring/doing a dual degree since I knew the workload in 4 years would be too much for me and I didn't really want to do a 5th one.

Also unless you're really interested in health care, not sure if nursing would be a good fit since there's clinicals later on that could conflict with your DMD coursework (just a guess since my nursing friends have clinicals that take up whole days and they didn't know their schedule until the summer). Plus CSE might be more related to DMD(?)"
UCONN,exhgudz,t1_exg3vjn,1566304750.0,"If it helps, it's called the Accessible Van Service and once the CSD/Student Health register you, you can schedule a pick up by calling the Transpo Services number. Pick up times are on 10 minute intervals (e.g. 1:00, 1:10, 1:20...)"
UCONN,ex0eghf,t1_ex0521z,1565911033.0,I highly recommend Amy! She's helped me a ton with nutrition.
UCONN,eu4d6rt,t1_eu495ua,1563449848.0,Wish I could upvote this more! I feel like most people have no idea
UCONN,etqymc1,t1_etlbhpo,1563107157.0,"I second this! Unfortunately, I don't have experience with any of these, but my freshman year I tried a bit of everything and then chose what I wanted keep/was able to handle. Once your time management and etc are better, you can add something else to your plate your second semester (there's an involvement fair every semester.) The best way to figure out if a club or org is right for you is to go in person though (:"
UCONN,etkb4cp,t3_cbqwmj,1562893499.0,Yup! Please get a guardrail from Work Order if you do decide to loft your bed. The thought of people falling off gives me anxiety. Also just a warning that Reslife asks you to also deloft later.
CasualConversation,et9mvrv,t1_et95jq1,1562600730.0,"I feel this. Back in middle school I used to have a short temper and after realizing it, I would write down my thoughts to cool down and just sort out things. This worked really well for me because it gave me a more objective standpoint when I reread what I had angrily ranted. One thing that really helped was that I typed it in my phone notes. The notes wouldn't sync anywhere and it was something I could keep to myself. I ended up deleting what I wrote after reflecting and working on things that I wanted to change about myself when reading my rants."

UCONN,esyqhjd,t3_c9hyjd,1562347602.0,I'm pretty sure Towers has triples.
UCONN,esl6rij,t3_c89hpj,1562080239.0,I think the website is down right now so your best bet would probably be to call Student Health & Wellness.
UCONN,esl6n8s,t3_c8996b,1562080177.0,Would highly recommend calling the Student Health & Wellness medical records office (:
UCONN,esi22zi,t1_esheppn,1562005332.0,"No problem at all! Yup, international orientation takes place before general move-in so that's a good idea. There's usually a trip to Target/Walmart/some department store during international orientation so you can use that time to buy anything you might need. I don't think it was on the first day of orientation last year so you'll probably know by the shopping trip if you need a fan or not. I know it can get pretty stressful being in a different country so definitely feel free to ask any other questions and I'll do my best to answer them (:"
UCONN,eshcx8h,t3_c7sihv,1561989660.0,"Welcome to UConn! My roommate emailed me with a little about themself and also their phone number/other contact information since it was more convenient than email. Reaching out beforehand is helpful to get to know each other a little and also coordinate who's bringing what. For instance, my roommate let me know that they were bringing a fridge that I could use too. We  also let each other know about our habits just as a heads up (e.g. waking up early/going to bed late, if you call/facetime people often, listening to music out loud, etc). 

&#x200B;

I do highly recommend that you bring/buy a personal fan though since it's pretty hot at the beginning of the summer (unless you're in Werth since I believe they have AC there). Tbh though not everyone contacts their roommate; I know one person who has never reached out to their roommate before the school year but hasn't had any conflicts with rooming."
UCONN,esh5gua,t3_c7rsjz,1561983090.0,I'm running into that too >:(
