CPTSD,fr1vlb7,t3_gm70gi,1589826682.0,"Tangent here but it reminded me of an old quote I read long ago in Spanish that had a phrase in it like ""the air breathes life."" 

Full quote was like ""The tree of life knows that.. however much death may come... the music will dance men and women so long as the air breathes them and the land plows and lobes them.""

Or another one: like a fish realizing it lives in water. 

In a nutshell, it felt like that."
AskBiology,fqyv695,t3_glljf5,1589755104.0,"The other guys have better detail here, but for an easy TLDR, glucose has a bunch of extra hydrogens that can be ripped off to make H- ion with 2 electrons (very unstable). Those H- get popped onto ""electron carriers"" NADH and FADH2, which does the actual job of sending them to the electron transport chain. The extra electrons get shifted to oxygen, giving us H+. Those H+ are trapped like water in a dam, and their movement outwards pushes a motor that spins to make ATP.

neuroscience,fqytuoi,t1_fqy8qqn,1589754458.0,"Thanks so much for your comments! Personally I know of research thats been done with the orbitofrontal cortex, vagal nerve complex, and the interoceptive system. Whats really cool is that I'm almost certain there's a way to measure dissociation in nonhuman species, specifically if you focus on the interoceptive system in the peripheral nerves, so I think there's a solid way to study at least sensorimotor dissociation. 

Loss of pain and feeling have specific physical correlates within the autonomic system that match with reduced area in the OFC instead of sensorimotor cortex. The vagal complex in particular seems to be conserved at least as far back as early mammals. Interoceptive awareness (via 2-way communication btwn OFC and nerves nestled in the extra cell environment) also decreases inflammation and increases blood flow, so I think there's crosstalk between these systems somewhere at the cellular level. My guess is that microglia have a huge role  somewhere here but yeah sorry for the ramble there"

I do what you're saying a lot (plus a whole bunch of other practices) but it's draining and my parts or trauma responses take over when I do. Like I'll meditate only for my body to rebound and make the triggers worse or send me into trauma reactions. Same with reprogramming my reactions or diffusing the old memories. Hard to juggle that with managing school, relationships with my housemates etc and my last therapist told me I was retraumatizing myself more by focusing inwards all the time."

CPTSD,fqek32f,t3_gia9a1,1589308864.0,"Been in and out of therapy over the years (I'm 19 started at 13) and honestly, I would've wished any of them could've recognized that I was being abused. No one did, and my ADHD, PTSD, DPDR went undiagnosed till college. Ignored the fact that I got in the first time due to (reflexive self defense) kicking my grandma in the leg when she was attacking me with a Gatorade bottle and a sandal or that it was the year I'd be in 2 car accidents, 3 fights, mom was at max with 24/7 triggers and emotional incest w me, repeatedly bullied at school, got a teacher to hate me for the first time (bc ADHD I think?), and would move 3 timezones away from where i lived my whole life. 

No one seems to see my trauma as valid (yay for complex inter generational family fun times plus racism and relational trauma) and technically I'm still undiagnosed beyond ""Mild depression, Mild anxiety."" Nasty habit of pushing out people who want to help, been through 2 therapists 2 psychiatrists and one university social worker in the past two years, and I'm shopping for therapists again atm because my last one had no idea how to help me and kept skirting around calling anything traumatic or abusive. I'm all for mental health support, like I'd like to do it for a career if I can, but I don't trust therapists much anymore knowing how little they're trained in trauma/stress responses or even basic attachment am really bad at describing my feelings (my childhood wasn't bad on a surface level and I'll keep it there till I get the courage to talk about the painful stuff) plus I have amnesia for a lot of the really messed up moments, so I get why I'd be a hard patient. But damn though--thousands of dollars only for the people to conclude there's nothing wrong with me when it took me half a days worth of neuro background and half an hour reading up on PTSD to find out .

CPTSD,fpt4mv2,t1_fprpgyx,1588884784.0,"Yeah it's been a lot of that kinda work, learning to notice these things and think about these things from the outside. She and my grandma probably projected a lot, especially since my grandad cheated on her. But he's been dead for 30 years so I'll never get to know anyways. 

I was in therapy, but my therapist told me on Monday she's basically given up and that I'm beyond her and my psychiatrists ability to help. I kinda push away help subconsciously, and her biggest issue with me was that I didn't schedule an appointment for a month after quarantine had started. Plus i kinda felt I had to learn a lot about trauma and dissociation on my own in order to heal and survive 2019, and she felt some type of way about that. She wants me to do an intensive DBT program, but I already know that it'll trigger so many issues with how I despise people trying to take care of me and worse, control me in any way (ie making me not do bad coping and losing most of my energy to the 4 hr/day program). Plus I already do DBT techniques, and those ones historically send me more into my head than out of it. (But again I'm looking for more options, there's some skills there that'll help too I'm not tryna dismiss it) 

Looking at my past on my own helps (although it's exhausting and triggering sometimes) asking Internet people lets me in on my blind spots and reminds me there's people like me out there, but I know I really need the safety of a good client-therapist relationship to heal more, so i've been looking again but schoolwork has had me struggling too. 

Those guy friends exist though! I'm always surprised at this but I noticed guys my age are a lot more sensitive to these things. The friends I made are all kinda like that and I appreciate it a lot.

Thank for your story I'm glad it's getting better! You find it hard taking care of yourself too? I find myself up all night long and I hate doing anything  that'll help me. Boundaries are super weird too, as I'm learning rn after moving into a frat house of all places.. 

I don't think expect men to hurt me like that.. at least i always dismissed that specific thought. I just grew up to be so wary of them, like if I opened up to any one, that they'd use it as an edge to attack me somehow. It's such a weird thing but I think i've kinda hated being a guy for a long time, like I can't trust myself because I'm a man... like trying to get intimate with people always feels like I'm intruding or manipulating them somehow. I'm working on it all, but recently the big thing has been this wall i didn't know i had between me and my housemates. Maybe I'm just avoidant in general at home but it's hard to say right now. 

I think if I were a girl, my mom would've seen more of herself in me. Maybe it's a fantasy but I like thinking it would've been better, like she'd have not done the things if she'd seen through my eyes better. Idk thoug"
raisedbynarcissists,fpqnele,t1_fpn0vgg,1588826988.0,"It's a major mindfuck. Just 100% of the way, but it gets easier as you learn to empathize with yourself. There's all these streams of thoughts that all contradict each other, and to say it's horrible doesn't give it enough credit. 

I used to idolize my mom, like she was someone I needed to help protect, and I still hold her in such high regard, but it's like making 2+2=5 when I think about how she might've hurt me the most out of anyone with this covert incest stuff. I still remember the conversation we had, when she asked me ""It was bad, sure... but it wasn't that bad right?""--- The guilt I felt, when I got furious and screamed about how it WAS that bad, how much I HATED the war that made her that way and all the men who hurt and abused her back then and how I hated myself for being a man like them and not the daughter/extension of herself that she always wanted to protect from those men in her past. One time, with a friend I'd told about this stuff, i started praising her again for one thing or another---when he stopped me halfway through like ""Fuck your mom! She abused the shit out of you!!"" My jaw dropped, and I was so disoriented at hearing that out loud... lol just a total mindfuck. 

For all my life, I'd always felt like my behavior was on autopilot, and there was this literal wall between me and my self awareness before I hit rock bottom and realized I needed to learn as much as I could if I was gonna survive college. Sorry for how long this will be but I need the reminder myself with how bad it's been recently, and I wanna share what I know in the hope this will help you too. 

Imma skip the brain science and give you one way to think about it (IFS, Somatic Experiencing/Polyvagal, and Adaptive Internal Relational models if you're curious). I'm simplifying a ton, but the gist is that there's multiple ""You's"" (very slippery word but it'll do)swimming around in your brain-soup: the Little Yous who felt the brunt of the pain, the Protectors who will do anything to avoid that pain, and the Executive You who is just trying to manage the day to day. 

*Note that most of these yous are stuck in the traumatic, which matches up with the reality that we're stressed 24/7 just trying to get by; when consciously we feel nothing bad going on, we still got these alarm bells going off from the first two kinds of You reacting to all the triggers/memories in our senses and surroundings. These parts, kid versions of you, get put in the drivers seat over the executive, which is what ""triggered"" really means for most people. * 

This makes it easier, cuz irl children are OVERWHELMINGLY simple once you know they been abused.. for them their #1 Prime Directive after survival is Avoid Pain at any cost. Their parts are almost all Protectors and Inner Children, and their conscious awareness gets cloudy past all the triggers they see around them. Kids will think or do nearly anything to protect from the pain, so the conflicts we have in our thoughts are reflections of the Executive and the Inner Children/Protectors fighting over control. Just this realization alone has made it SO MUCH EASIER to put the pieces together and learn to reprocess my memories.

Problem is: just remembering it will trigger tf out of me (it's actually happening as I write this lol).  So instead of triggering myself, I like to imagine being a witness to my hurt, aka remembering in 3rd person instead. So maybe I'll pretend I'm the childhood therapist who I never had, or that I'm the neighbors having to listen through thin walls all the screaming, the crying, the abusive shit my family said to me and so on. Other times i don't even need to think about the events themselves so much as notice how damn much the trauma permeates in my actions. Again pretending I'm someone else helps, or alternatively immersing myself in stories where the writer or characters have to deal with things I've dealt with lets me identify with my pain by pretending it's someone else. Big questions I have to ask myself when I do is this: What would I feel if I saw this from the outside? What did this scared child feel back then? How does this still affect us as a person? 

Reprocessing and learning to make things into a cohesive narrative is THE CORE of virtually every evidence-based therapy for trauma and dissociation, cus its basically the Executive taking those splintered brain states (= sum of your thoughts, feelings, experiences, etc) and weaving a new narrative out of them. 

Some fun(ny) examples from my life: 
- I'd get furious if anyone gave me any haircut that wasn't a bowl cut because I recoil at the thought of being seen. 
- I never cried as hard as the time my elementary school wanted me to get speech therapy, especially after one counselor asked me ""if I felt like I had the whole world on my shoulders"" because of stress at home. (Got out of it by kicking and screaming at ""losing my education"" LMAO) 
- I subconsciously smile at people when I'm sad and I talk octaves higher than my natural voice to pretend to people I'm happy, confident, and ready to take care of them. Being upset in any way shape or form was an insult to nFamily's parenting skills, so in a family of traumatized narcissists, this worked REALLY WELL in a really fucked up way. This is also why I have a major block on self reflection and need to use 3rd person to remember and think through things without triggering myself (i've heard of people who have to do the opposite, so take what I'm saying with some salt on the side lol). 
- I was a child actor, never got any jobs, but I'm a damn good actor and I'd lie compulsively when I switched school to pretend I was anyone at all who wasn't me. Learned dozens of accents in different languages while traveling and I'll code switch without any awareness I'm doing it. Expressing any of my emotions makes me feel like I'm playing another character to manipulate the people around me again. 
- I used to run from the TV when characters kissed each other and I still recoil at love or the thought of being cared for. Realized last week ish that my family's ""affection"" was always a cover for toxicity, that things like ""I'd kill myself without you and your brother to take care of"" are NOT normal things to say to a child. 

And Etc. 

I really needed this today. Even if I distracted myself for a few hours putting my thoughts together lol. I hope this helps. 

PS: The basic skill I wanna be getting at here is to be able to make a cohesive narrative out of the abuse. If you think of your memories like the glowing beads from Inside Out that would get filed away by your emotions, trauma is like that but if the memory exploded and there's all these shards scattered everywhere. You can't file them away in Higher Memory if they're in pieces and scattered across your sensory and emotional brain-parts, so we gotta put those pieces together. But picking any one of them up hurts, so Little You will redirect, avoid, and do anything to avoid touching them. (For another fun visual, unhealthy coping is like having a knife in your chest and trying to cook dinner without cutting yourself on it). 

The task then is to pick up the pieces without getting cut, so you use gloves, towels, whatever you can to pick them up without touching them directly (which is what all trauma-therapies are at their core). Being able to narrate, feel through and witness your hurt without falling back into the Avoid Pain directive is the HEART of EVERY evidence-based practice for trauma and dissociation out there, even the ones that don't treat traumas directly like CBT/DBT or Acceptance and Commitment therapy."

Life has a way of making use of every single part it can use, and what inefficiency is there tends to have a larger purpose elsewhere. Like gene copies for example seem kinda redundant, like why would you need copies of the same exact thing? But  they're actually immensely important for evolution since the few differences between the copies ends up creating new protein variants that cells use for new purposes.

To sum up a long lecture on some relatively new neuroscience, we absolutely think and process emotions with our body. When you feel ""icky"" (or any other type of way), that's your body part feeling like it did when X thing happened, and now it's triggering a ""body-memory"" that your brains feels the need to disconnect from. 

Personally, it's like my whole body is patchy in my awareness. Parts of me ring out, so I'll focus on them really hard (touch or brushing also help in bringing my attention). They'll start twitching and grumbling as I hold the feeling there and if i did it right, the tension will release and I get all tingly there (maybe along with old feelings or memories flooding back too) and I'll feel more whole afterwards. 

Massage also helps, but these feelings seem to be below the skin, so for me i've had to learn deep tissue and myofascial release to get at some of them. It's incredible how much these two work when I'm able to consistently work on them. 

If you want more info on any of this, look up vipassana meditation, body scanning, somatic experiencing, or interoception. Also yoga and regular touching/brushing are supposed to help, but I'm kinda bad at doing those regularly so I don't have experience to say much on them. Good luck!!"
evolution,fpawzpi,t3_gca8kk,1588457455.0,"Everyone commenting has missed the point. 

The evolutionary niche we carved out as a species has been our cooperative nature and the cognitive skills associated that ended up promoting the other aspects that make us unique like language, altruism with nonkin and etc. 

All these came about with the rise of big game hunting, which we had to do as a coordinated group, since individually we'd be ass at taking down large animals. So having to coordinate groups, assign specific roles to people, there was a huge selective pressure to easily identify and process one another (things like gaze, predicting actions, emotions and so on). 

Along with little pressures on what kinda shapes our faces needed to conform to, we diversified wildly in facial morphology. It's impossible to say when this diversification happened, but i can say the earliest would be with Homo habilis since they were the first species we know for sure relied on hunting, cooking, and coordinating with each other to survive. All these pressures would've been there at that time, so it's safe to assume any diversification would've happened after their time, about 2 million years ago"

So i'll ask anyways, and answer if you want. 

• Do you think it's a hardware issue or does it sound like file corruption? • Does Chkdisk not working mean it's a physical issue and I'm fucked? • Surface checks for data readability according to the program documentation--it doesn't guarantee its physical so why you say it's 100% bricked when it's just limited to the same size as the file that I was writing to when it disconnected? • If it's file corruption, can cordoning it off in a separate directory do anything to slow its spread enough to read the image files? • I've heard you can wipe corrupted data, is that a plausible workaround assuming it is file corruption? • Is there any way to check if an individual file is undamaged that won't make me pay my monthly rent in paywall??

CPTSD,foor4y9,t3_g8m9kf,1587944698.0,"Hey there. I've been where you're at for a long while. It's confusing as hell when you feel blank, but you can work yourself out of it. For me the first sign is not being able to notice some of my body feelings and senses, and progresses more stages before I go totally blank and feel floaty and can't feel anything. 

So two main goals: learning to let in these body feels, and learning to empathize with yourself. 

Meditation and body practices for the first one. I do vipassana and body scans, but those can get overwhelming if you go to fast. Usually it's easiest to just ask myself to open up my senses, but it's not something I can keep up for a long time. Massage+brushing my skin helps open me up to those feelings. Ive remembered a lot more and lost a lot of the panicky type of anxiety i used to suffer since learning how to do deep tissue (i find a knot press gently and hold it until it releases). I'll notice specific body feelings (like rn there's an itch in my arm where I have a scar) and if i can focus on it long enough without reacting to it, it ramps up in tension and eventually release and the muscles around it get wayy looser than before. Remember to be patient and nonjudgmental when your body starts resisting. 

Then the trick for the second one for me has been imagining these situations and feelings from 3rd person, because imaging myself in my shoes at those times just doesn't work. So things like TV, books, movies, stories about trauma all help. Sometimes one small detail will send me into tears bc of how much it taps into one sore part of my life. Imagining myself as a character, imagining a character living my story, pretending to be a friend or therapist listening to me say it, or that it's someone else describing my experiences back to me all help. Writing about it helps. Sometimes I write in 3rd person and it'll make me feel a lot more, but it's overwhelming if i don't go slow. Reading up on the science helps bc itll show me things I never paid attention to and it lets me be the little therapist in my head asking me:"" How did you feel when that happened?"" ""What do you feel in your body?"" ""Are you feeling abandonment right now?""

The body stuff is somatic experiencing+polyvagal theory, meditation is called vipassana (limiting myself to one part of my body makes it less overwhelming to do). Other resources are this subreddit (so much gold, could send you posts I've saved if you want), youtube channels like Kati Morton and CrappyChildhood fairy, and books from Levine, Walker, Brene brown and Besser Van der Kolk are all amazing along w their talks and websites. My favorite resource is First We Make the Beast Beautiful but it's more about managing emotions in the moment than reconnecting with past traumas. 

I hope this helps!!"

""How to exist without feeling ashamed"" lmao... for a lot of years my anxiety has felt like it's suffocating me and now i'm finding out that my lack of feeling is partly a lack of blood flow from muscle constriction. What irony when I grew up anxious and scared, that the suffocation i felt was literally happening slowly and slowly.

CPTSD,fo8jow2,t1_fo8d00o,1587597877.0,"i was suicidal at 11 too. i wish you knew how close to my story that sounds. Last year i felt how you do (i got lucky and stay close to my uni, else id go home to across the country or to our other country). I took acid and found out about ptsd dissociation, first time that i truly felt how fractured my feelings were and it sent me into a horrible self isolating spiral. recovery has meant reading up on psychology massage and neuro to survive bc therapy too infrequent for me and it's my major anyways. It's slow and it's hard work but it's what i had to do to survive. 

The big thing is that what you're feeling is totally normal. Parts of you have these alarm bells going off either from tension or trapped memories (usually both), and focusing on letting those feelings in safely is very important. I know w myself that there's only a certain point i can feel my body without massage, bc when i dissociate i tense up the muscle and lose feeling in it. Also journaling, self awareness. Reading up on other people's experiences has been the best thing personally, bc i usually feel numb but if i see my experiences on tv that helps me feel the emotion. That's the important part tho, focus on the feelings and pm me man like everything you said was ripped from my brain. I've been there and i can't help wanting to reach out."
Fibromyalgia,fo8hbz0,t1_fo8bg5u,1587596558.0,"Yea no i've been trying my best at doing  a lot of these things. I learned to meditate on my body and focus on feelings, listen and care for inner child, self awareness, those things have definitely helped. I'm trying my best to get more into that attitude but there's a block i'm getting over. 

 i did downplay how bad each muscle is, lots are straight tied up in each other up and causing pain down my body. Lots are tender all the time but it's literally hard to feel and notice it when it's happening, some spots worse than others, Did contact sports, have generational trauma from 3 parents. I realized only recently that id been flexing whenever something bad was happening happening as a kid, which was a lot, and it's a habit i had for a long while. Sexual issues 
 (that get better when i do my glutes). I feel the difference in blood pressure between my limbs and where the bloods stuck at . Even rn my hand is kinda numb and i need to adjust how i'm laying down. I can feel the tangles inside of the muscles when i press down and almost all  are stuck together sometimes from completely different places. Moving them back (using anatomy reference) and getting knots out restores feeling in a big way, changes skin tone (i'm supposed to be browner than i am), restores the sensitivity to pain (it gets much worse before it gets better), changes the shape of the muscle, makes me dream more (i used to not have any), remember more from childhood. In general feel more human. 

So i'm definitely going to talk to doctor while also moving the blood from my head and appreciating your message."

AskBiology,fo4jsp1,t3_g5lofu,1587505710.0,"The tricky thing about oxidative stress is that it's a normal part of cell function. Radical oxygen species get made as a byproduct within mitochondria and get used as signaling molecules, and there's tons of repair and reduction systems that manage it. 

Just shooting electrons would be a dangerous way to go about it. Electron microscopy samples are as dead as they come after you shoot electrons at them. Antioxidants like CoQ are able to manage oxidative stress, but those don't repair damage that's already been done. You could make a cell immortal maybe using optimized genes for repair or cell cycle progression, but that's also how you get cancer so I wouldn't trust it. Mitochondria divide themselves, die and trigger apoptosis when there's too much damage in them, so maybe there's an angle there? NADH, FADH2 and glutathione are all major reducer  (they toss hydrogens w extra electrons at oxidized atoms), and their levels are closely managed by a bunch of different systems. But just throwing reducers at the problem also imbalances chemistry and energy production, so it's not a perfect solution either. 

As a writer, I want to imagine some microorganism that symbiotically repairs cells or soaks up oxygen species, but there's a lot of new science in microbiomes and oxidative stress, so I can't say for sure. You'd wanna look up ""radical oxygen species"" specifically to find more. Tardigrades have this amazing DNA protection system going on, and I think theres a worm out there that's virtually immortal. I have heard of cells inside cells (mitochondria being the most relevant obv) plus there's the microbiome inside of us so I think there's room to play with that."

I watched this one anime that addressed this feeling really well though. One character is like us, deeply traumatized and passively suicidal.

To value oneself so little, as thought one were disposable, is to say that those of us they’ve saved are just as worthless.”

By just existing, we impact the world and people around us in countless butterfly effect kinda ways; wishing to not exist is like disrespecting the ones who love us and all that we bring to the world.

CPTSD,fnh75a0,t3_g1kmw1,1586956479.0,"Hey I'm in the same position (sort of). 19M sophomore, graduating next year cuz I overdid things in high school. I've had some of the experiences you beat yourself over, but in shittier more nightmarish ways.

I've partied and drank since I was 15, which is fun at times, but it feels alienating a lot. Sometimes I binge and I keep  binging, or I breakdown and cry for somebody to hold me. At 16 I tried having sex at such a party, before I'd ever had a first kiss, but then I couldn't get it up. All her friends were there; my friends were there, and everyone at school found out. All other times I've tried sex, it's failed on my end for probably a mix of reasons.  The relationships I tried just never worked bc of my codependency, and even though none were intimate or deep, the breakups were painful like withdrawal from heroin. 

Ever since finding out about the trauma, i've been having to heal myself piece by piece, and it's been freaking hard to realize how little I knew about myself before this stuff happened. But the frank truth that I've been struggling to ignore while typing this, is that we don't get a redo. In a way that's a good thing (he says, holding back tears). At least now I know my toxic habits, I know what I don't want in relationships, and I know that anyone I try to have one with will have to be a saint for their patience. My experiences sucked ass, and moving past them will be the hardest thing i ever do. You still have the chance to avoid what I did by forcing myself into those situations. 

Imma rattle off some things I'd wish I'd known before: Get to know yourself better, be patient with yourself, and wait for people you feel safe around before trying anything. Don't be afraid to tell your story and to be vulnerable with the people you trust (they'll probably understand). Feeling safe in any moment should be top priority. Remember that you're on this sub bc you have trauma in your past that you need to take care of yourself for. Mindfulness always helps. Talk to yourself and make your body a home you can feel safe in. Relationships should feel supportive and don't take them for granted. 

That explanation probably sucked, but it's 6am where I'm at. I just don't want you to end up the way I did, so I hope you take things gentle, especially with yourself. My mistake was pushing things too fast and ignoring my history, and now I'm traumatized over lots more than I could've been. We're also really young, and you'll have lots of years to learn and navigate relationships where you can feel safe and loved."

The dpdr though? Less so. I'm much less full on dissociated than I used to be but i still have visual distortions everywhere and my body is still patchy.

For me, my voice got deep in a month when i was 11, shoulders broadened when i was 12-14. Probably had extra high testosterone when i was that age for some reason. But then again once i was 14 things started calming down and i was just left with overwhelming anxiety, so maybe there was a big mental component too. i kept face chubbiness for a while but getting to college my body skinnied up, especially my face. I was a very intense athlete in high school so the muscles have always been there, but they tense up a lot to the point it's painful, caused major anxiety. and massaging has been so relieving that Id rather be skinny and mushy than muscular and anxious all the time lmao 

Tbh people look insanely different when they graduate vs when they come into college. Personally I think of growth as ending about 25 but there's no fixed point where anything ever really stops. But mental attitudes are incredibly tied up with your biology--i've experienced this firsthand as I've recovered and learned how to make my body into a home by massaging myself meditating (not in the monk way lol) and doing psychological work.

short,fmq3e4m,t1_fmq0o3h,1586292142.0,"Yeah so if you're in stress your brain signals your body to release stress hormones that affect literally every cell across your body. Overall stuff gears up for survival over anything else, so growth ends up being one of those things our body deprioritizes. Those growth hormones would be released during sleep, but if you're stressed you'll have worse quality sleep from things like muscle tension, nightmares and it ends up being a double whammy for our growth rates. But what I've read shows that the growth still happens, just more slowly over a slightly longer time than usual. So long as you get the right vitamins and materials to make stuff work in your body, you should be alright

I'm 19M, from a crappy household where I spent most of my life living with parents and grandparents with PTSD. Very stressed all the time, but I moved out in 2018 and it's been noticeably different.

survivorsofabuse,fmivf90,t1_fmi2utl,1586117716.0,"Yea it sounds like you're recreating some specific dynamics without meaning to and that's why you've been ending up in this rollercoaster. Personally my dynamic is being a very warm person so they'll get close with me, but i'll usually hold them at arms length in my head to recreate the abandonment pain from childhood. It's a fickle thing to nail down tho (like stapling jello to the wall at first), so it's a long process of noticing the little behaviors/reactions we have subconsciously, plugging those up when you can, and building up to these larger realizations that you can act on to make healing relationships. (such a good feeling lemme tell u). Good guiding principle is that we recreate what hurt us as kids: for me that's my moms and grandmas unpredictable ptsd and swinging from anger to uncaring to loving etc, my dads absence and ASD personality, leading me to reject the idea that anyone could really love or like me at all, bc with my parents that love was always shallow and it signaled danger from physical emotional verbal abuse. Most importantly it's not your fault bc it's almost impossible to make sane decisions when you're cut off from the trauma emotions and memories that make you act out in these ways. Yeah you can take responsibility, but never think about it more than 10 minutes bc more shame and guilt won't help you heal and escape. You're not a fuckup for struggling with this. 

You very much care how people feel about you, and it's sounding like your reactions of shame, rejection, and perceived threat (paranoia) are coming out and distressing the hell out of you until you release that energy in the argument/confrontation and y'all are both left exhausted and confused so you feel like you need to make up reasons rather than letting them in on just how chaotic your inner world is. Again like i've been there; it's rough for everyone involved. Not a lot of people know the slip n slide, but if you clue them in, it'll be easier to understand than if you didn't let yourself be vulnerable. Plus you're gonna be vulnerable anyways from the triggers, so might as well have it be in a way that strengthens the relationship. 

Something else that's helped me is reading other people's stories or talking with other friends who I know went through shit too. It's kinda insane how much we all talk like each other, and for me i need that outside perspective to remember and heal my own traumas (cuz if i don't i stay first person and that just recreates the shitty feelings from when they happened). Read up on some psychology if you get the chance---recommend body awareness/mindfulness, attachment theory, and the 4Fs (my guess you are fawn->freeze and then fight but that's for you to figure out). Those are all pretty universal/understandable and they clear up a lot of confusion for why we do things x y z in relationships cuz trust that those bring out the most confusing and painful parts of ourselves. ( pm me if you want really funny and sad stories about this lmao) 

Also, **you are worthy and capable of being loved in a supportive relationship. You are not your past nor your triggers; you are you underneath the trauma brain, and that's golden right there.**"
survivorsofabuse,fmhn3of,t3_ftvm78,1586086951.0,"1) Not a bad person. Shame is a number one reaction to being hurt, especially as a child who was helpless to stop it. Even if you have substance issues, even if you did regretful things while you were in the trauma-haze. 

When the trauma is deep enough (or happened early enough), social issues are inevitable because we struggle to regulate our brains in the way most people do because we were put in shitty situations and didn't learn from our family the way we needed to properly develop. Frankly i relate too much to you as another childhood ""survivor"" (felt dead inside my whole life so idk how alive that makes me lol) and I used to just act social or pretend the me people like couldn't be the same me behind the mask, but that's flat wrong 

The fact is you're learning and managing these things one day at a time, and that shit is hard. I invite you to take a step back and recognize the magnitude of what pain and confusion you're dealing with moment to moment, and realize that you've always been doing your best to cope. The trauma haze is a really horrible thing and it brings out the worst in us sometimes. But now you've grown so much already, and there's a lot left to learn and enjoy once you've unlocked your body past your trauma-brain reactions to the world. Trust that it's wonderful thing to see change in yourself.

Yes you need a psychologist, but don't think that they're the ones who will make you better because it's always going to be you climbing yourself out of the dark and into a healthier mindset. Eventually you'll look at the photos and see your child self, or the version of you that hurts when it's reminded by those photos of the pain they went through. Empathize with yourself and sit with the pain without judging or giving words to it. Just let yourself grieve and it'll release a lot of this tension that clearly still affects you."

I actually really struggle to take care of myself nutritionally, maybe that's just part of being a poor college student or maybe that's just an excuse. I take vitamin gels and teas to try compensating and I'm hoping to eat healthier soon. Mostly it's carbs and sodium at the moment. 

Not very often. I used to take tylenol a few times a week for pain and to reduce anxiety (unrelatedly there's evidence it helps with mood regulation, not that i knew at the time but still). I take aleeve nowadays when the muscle pain is a lot but that's much less often than it used to. Even when I don't take pain meds I have a really high pain tolerance (once gave myself a cigarette burn to see how far it'd go; didnt feel pain till halfway through putting it out) but it goes away in spots once I do mental-somatic work or massage the muscle group. 

I'm a little concerned about the soreness though. My body always seems to be sore everywhere, so it's weird telling that from massage damage and even harder when I'm dissociated from large sections of my body like my torso. If it's from massage, the soreness lingers in a single spot for a day or two with shakiness but never to the point i can't move that muscle anymore. My family also has essential tremors so there's that also."

Also yeah there's been times I've felt more pain than expected and had to stop because of it... where's the line between that and damaging my muscles more permanently?"
CPTSD,flx0f5l,t3_fquwmv,1585571662.0,"I happen to be in college studying neuro while I'm going through all this healing business.. It's helped me a ton to wrap my head around this CPTSD stuff. Pete Walker and other books can explain better but Ill try my best. 

To keep things simple, anxiety/stress is a response from the back of the brain. It's this little chemical that diffuses through the rest of your brain and signals adrenaline/stress hormones to get the rest of the body ready to survive some threat. It redirects blood flow from deeper, more front brain processes (like social thinking) towards hyper vigilance and other stress responses. Normally those frontal lobe processes can inhibit the rest of your system to keep you feeling safe and well regulated, but that depends on important developmental events like receiving unconditional care and love as a baby and so on. Babies can only cry if they're not cared for well, so we grow up without learning how to self soothe and inhibit our stress responses. These systems are like yin and yang, and over time with us, our back of the brain stress responses overwhelm your brain and body for years and years that requires intense healing mentally to repair the internal damage. 

Whats always amazing is how interconnected this all is to my story. My parents have PTSD/suspected ASD and they had many issues while I was growing up. That emotional neglect kept me from hitting these milestones like learning how to self soothe and feel comfortable in my own skin.  I also had undiagnosed ADHD, so that exacerbated a lot of this. But now I experience that neglect through my anxiety, the eternal restless across my body from the chronic muscle tension to the moments i feel the adrenaline hit but i'm too dissociated to even notice my heart beating faster. It's kinda wild to think through"
Virology,flwtcke,t3_frkfwx,1585564371.0,"I actually like to take this mechanistic approach you're using to just conclude that life is, at its most raw parts, ""self""replicating (reproduce by *some* means, whether on its own like a cell or as an obligate parasite like virus) chemical system. Doing so let's us extended the definition to include viroids, satellite RNA, prions, even that weird dog STD that gives them cancer: all are biological molecules that are modeled by evolution/selection to their natural environments and means of replicating. 

Then ofc you get into the issue that my definition makes basically every regulated systems within/between organisms as ""Also Life"" such as the krebs cycle or genes being horizontally transferred between local cells, etc. That's a feature, not a bug imo. The idea that life is so much more than what we consider an organism to be is honestly so grand in my head"

Not a lot of people get as far as pulling themselves out, and you've gained this new experience in healing that you can use to reorient yourself and use this time well.

depression,flgxiu9,t3_fon2l0,1585152212.0,"It's complicated honestly. I hate the emphasis on loving yourself, cuz for me at least, i don't feel even a quarter as crazy about me as even NPCs in video games. Frankly though, it's true, and I mean that from experience cuz I tried otherwise. The big thing is keeping a cool enough head to 1) not spiral into your negative self talk and taking motherly care of yourself (aka better than you'd do for yourself normally) and 2) having the ability to empathize and have patience with the other person to be able to think through and appreciate their point of views when y'all come across difficulties. Over time if you approach it healthily you can come to appreciate what it is they love in you and see it for your own self when you look in the mirror. 

My turning point for that came last year when my best friend and on/off crush told me that I ""shine so bright like the sun."" Now I certainly didn't understand or believe that at first but as I've healed it's been more and more easy to see in the mirror. Watch that happen with yourself, don't hold the depression so close to your head and let the relationship add to your self image and use it as an opportunity to grow and know yourself."

COVID19positive,fla5ezg,t3_fmxnlg,1584977005.0,"19M - My close friend seemed to be really sick circa a day or two ago, with fever dry cough and muscle aches. Said it hit like a truck really. 

Now i have had this mad headache for a few days along with a scratchy throat that doesn't go away. Today i think i developed a slight fever that's been coming and going (but i have no thermometer to check; thanks looters), my muscles are all achier than usual and i feel this like tight band around my chest when i breathe. It doesn't hurt, but i hear the wheezing a little. I have asthma and I'm scared it is covid, but the hospital phone line for it put me on hold for ages. I'm in a heavier hit area (San Diego) and I don't know when i should really start getting concerned. 

It's frustrating bc i NEEED to move asap (uni won't refund my housing otherwise) but I can't go out to sign my new place if i'm genuinely sick with this."
CPTSD,fl9xy5i,t1_fl9veok,1584972154.0,"Well it's certainly obvious you could use the release. It's just hard when you're like us there's just all this energy we want to get out and that can scare people away very easily. I don't think you're uninteresting, just that how much you share overwhelms others. Imagine if it were you on the other side of the conversation; all these things you have to learn and think through in order to understand the stories and traumas---it's exhausting to listen to and process. I've over shared too many times to even count, so at this point i do my best to signal briefly that there's some trauma history and if they ask more, i open up more. It's really hard though to lose that balance though, so don't be down on yourself for having trouble with something we all struggle with when we have cptsd.

Anyways you already have a web browser and I know Chrome and Safari (and likely most other browsers) are both capable of using pdf files, so you'll be able to read them no matter what. Inside the computer all they are is just letters and numbers without any wacko programming stuff going on so it should work. I'll send you the link for you to get started with it :)"
