After my last psychotic break, almost a year before I met my wife, my mother helped me to put together a decent budget.  Since I was on my own it was only good enough to make sure that the bills were paid.  After moving in with my wife, I slowly adopted her routines.  Even still it can be hard.  We went through a minimalism phase, which was nice, but after getting rid of certain stuff I bought replacements after the phase wore off.  The key for me is to have some sort of budget with the understanding that I am not going to stick to it perfectly.  I am actually sort of obsessed with it and enjoy reconciling the accounts and planning for the next month.  I guess that not every one is interested in that sort of thing.  Even I wasn't for the longest."

What is helping me is that my wife and I have a somewhat strict budget (we are working on clearing up the rest of our debt).  So now I have a fraction of what I was working with before.  I still get impulsive and buy stuff, but the stuff is a lot cheaper.  I have a budget line item for pocket money (which I still go over).  It is not a perfect solution, but the impact of my impulsive buying hurts a lot less.  I guess the takeway is to have some sort of financial goal to work towards that forces you to limit how much cash you can spend on non-essentials."

For quite a while I held on to the belief that I was sort of transmitting my thoughts and that everyone knew what I was thinking and doing (amongst other delusions).  This even extended to the thought that people could see, hear, smell, and taste what I was experiencing.  Like they were jacked into my mind.  There were some experiences that seemed to coroborate this delusion as well.  This is like another level of being naked, and it is like being naked all of the time.  It was a terrible feeling.  Though now it is only in the back of my mind and is much easier to dismiss much like my other previous delusions.  It took several hospitalizations and interventions for me to finally truly accept help, become receptive to recovery and treatment, and become med compliant.  What I would do, and what I would tell myself to do if I went back is to get professional help immediately and to comply with their recovery plan."

These voices are distinctly different than my normal internal dialogue.  They feel like a foreign element in my mind.  There are sometimes where my internal dialogue might seem like it is portraying itself as a an external voice, but there is not that foreign sensation that comes along with it.  I do not know why this happens, maybe I am lonely or something.  Or my mind desires some sort of stimulation.  I think the key element there is that there is a sense of other self or foreigness that comes from the internal voices that sets them apart.  There are times when the internal voices surprise me.  They may say something unpredictable, witty, or profound at those times.

Edit:  Over the years I have grown more skeptical of my experiences and more readily call out hallucinations.  In the past they seemed very real to me and were essentially part of my life experience, and I would not consider them hallucinations at all.  There are times when old delusions seem to try to reestablish themselves, but they do not seem to take as deep a hold on me as they did in the past.  The most persistent dellusion that I battle is that my mind is being monitored by a large group of interconnected minds by means of a psychic connection.  This seems to fuel the internal voices."

The last time this happened, I ended up in hospital for almost month.  By the time that I realized I needed my meds, my life was spiraling out of control.  I was manic for over a month; towards the end I tried to start taking my meds again, but within a day or so I had lost all sense of reason and had to be hospitalized.  The whole end experience was horrible, psychoticaly I screamed at my family and slashed my arm with a sharp kitchen knife.  I had mostly lost touch with reality.  That experience has convinced me to stay med compliant.  There are still times that I forget doses, but I usually catch myself within a missed dose.

Edit:  I think that it is important to also say that up until that point (to becoming manic) I had been off of my meds for about five months.  During that time I felt like I would not need meds and that I was fine.  It was a sort of cognitive dissonance between knowing that I had an illness but rejecting the treatment because I was getting along pretty well without many symptoms."

We had talked before on a dating app and had lost touch for a while.  Though that is all easier said than done.  The drive for a romantic connection can be a very strong one.  People at the time were telling me to let things happen naturaly, but for the longest I was obsessed with online dating.  Though they were all pretty much right.  Once I let it go, I was able to focus on myself.  Nothing occured in a way that I expected it to, the universe had its own timleine to adhere to.  At the time I was going NA meetings, and that eventually filled in the black hole that demanded a loving connection.  At least for a while.

I think it is completely natural to want a partner and not selfish at all.  Even going into a relationship with the package of mental illness, we still deserve to be loved and cherished.  Apart from having anxiety issues from time to time, my wife has good mental health.  This has been very helpful for me as she can help me muddle through the distortions of my illness on my bad days.  She has never complained and treats me as an equall.  We both compliment each other and our relationship has turned out to be the best for both of us so far.

I hope that you find what is best for you, whether that is a partner or a stronger connection with yourself or both.  The burden of an illness is tricky in a relationship, but companionship and love outweigh that burden by a lot."

There was a time that I went off of my meds and was well for about half a year, only to have a relapse.  Other times it did not take as long.  I hope that you find what works best for you.  I guess the safest advice that I could give you is to not make that leap without medical guidance from a professional.  As far as dealing with the mental fog, I have grown kind of used to it.

Facing the unknown can be terrifying, especially when you have experiences that would tell you that being hospitalized is horrible.  Though for the time being it seems that you are with it enough to seek help.  Not to make things worse, but you may be heading to a mental place where you will no longer even make that consideration.  Now would be the time to get the help that you need, if not only for your sake but also for the sake of those you care about and are around you.

Interestingly enough, I follow a similar routine now, but one that has been honed a bit over the years and improved upon by wife and myself (it is a continuous work in progress).  I am sure the circumstances are very different, but probably in most cases it is coming from a place of love.  When it comes to family and loved ones, they often want or even need something that they can take action on (or control of).  One thing that you could act on is to educate yourself and pass along what you find to them or encourage them to do research on their own.

We keep a portion of our finances seperate and as such my spending has not had a terrible impact on our quality of life, but with our ""Debt Snowball"" plan we are pooling our resources together and I will have much less to work with.  I think by the time we are done, and with me being used to running on a little less, we will probably have more integrated finances.  Anyways, it is something we are both excited about."

I struggle with playing for more than thirty minutes, but simple idle games are nice to check on every once in a while.  About a year ago I had some negative thoughts and guilt about my desire to game so much, but my wife explained to me that on the days that I do play, I seem a bit more with it and present.  She assured me that it was a totally ok hobby to have so long as I find time to spend with her and the girls.  We also try to get walks in together, and that is about the extent of exercise that I get."
schizoaffective,f7c8waw,t3_dvep0o,1573586993.0,"I really enjoyed reading about your ""5 Pillars of Managing Schizophrenia.""  It helps me to read about how others cope with the illness in addition to the variety of miss-adventures that come up.  It is also good to hear how various coping mechanisms work AND fail.  When I was active on various Facebook groups, I found it comforting to hear about how people navigated (or didn't) their day to day with or without negative symptoms.  Positive symptoms are less common for me now, but the negative symptoms seem to be often present and I struggle with them quite a bit.  Another aspect of your blog I really enjoyed was when you shared your experience and participation with the 501st Legion.  Perhaps you may wish to keep some of your interests to yourself, which is totally fine, but it is good for me to hear about how other people pursue, engage, and attain their interests.  I still find it very difficult to engage in my interests, and there are countless little projects that I have come up with but still have not managed to attend to.

I can't seem to play a video game for too long as well.  When I started playing DnD and Pathfinder with friends, it was a big chore to sit around for that long focusing on the game.  That, at least, has gotten a bit better.  I can play a session a few hours before wanting to get the hell out of there or retreat to my ""office."""

I would say that there is hope, but it will require him to make a willfull choice for that semi-normal life.

At that time the general suggestion was to stay single for a year.  Nonetheless, I met my current wife online and we started dating at the 11 month clean mark.  Despite having body image issues, my wife is very supportive and only expresses concern for my overall health and not my general weight.  It is certainly possible to find love and relationship regardless of what size we are.

Also, from my experience, the right kind of therapy may be what she needs to get by for now.

I think that, as they tend to go, I had the typical delusions such as being contacted by divine beings and fell beings.  I also was under the notion that I was a sort of mesiah as well at one point.

Looking back I would say that I was still dysfunctional and anxious, but if I were to step backwards and look through my past perspectives I would insist that my mind was sharp and that I was on top of things.  Back then I was a lot more spontaneous (read as impulsive).  I really was sharp, but it was more intuitive and I just seemed to know things.  I could also remember conversations verbatim.  I can still be arrogant from time to time, but having been knocked down a few times I suppose my perspective is a bit more realistic now.  Life now is lived through a fog with a variety of clarity, sometimes thick sometimes thin.

My wife reminds me to take meds from time to time, but it is me who has to stay on top of the schedule the rest of the time.  I am very fortunate to have the support that I do have, but one thing that I seem to miss most is the general connection from my family.  You may be the person he approaches for a bit of normalcy.  I understand that things may be strained between the two of you, but you already have the right mindset and that should guide you to being a good supporter.

I am  very fortunate to have such an understanding wife and support foundation.  Though, I think it is important to get out the generalities.  Particularly recurring themes and symptoms.  I find that when I share what is going on with me the illness has a lot less power over me and I feel less alone.  The stuff that I normally do not want to share may be violent in nature or perhaps make me very uncomfortable.  Maybe talk to her about what you can and explain that you will share more when you are ready.  If she is wanting to find some way to be proactive and supportive, help her find ways to do so.
