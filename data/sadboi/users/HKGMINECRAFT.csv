The [original one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_British_Columbia) looks too cluttered and integrates the union jack poorly.

How I redesigned it:

I took the flag from the [British Indian Ocean Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_British_Indian_Ocean_Territory), removed the palm tree and the crown, and slapped on the sun and crown from the original.

My design choice:

I decided to keep it as close to the original as much as possible as its symbolism is already very meaningful and memorable. Long story short, I just made it look better without removing any of the key elements.

EDIT: The independence of Taiwan, Macau and Hong Kong would be mainly under the reason of numerous differences in the social and cultural level as there is more than enough of it to distinguish them from the mainland (hence why didn’t make Manchuria independent as it is the most similar to China proper —trust me, I’ve been to northern China, Heilongjiang myself)"

History, culture and international support in these regions would also play a role in the justification for these independence movements. 

During the collapse of the USSR, several states found themselves independent, so I would assume that this would happen as well.

I haven’t done too much research on this, but if my predictions are correct, this this the most likely event to happen to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the near future.

***This is a fictional portrayal and prediction of future events and is not meant to be accurate. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.***  


**The Collapse of China:**

After the ████ of 20█, the economic crisis caused widespread unrest throughout China. The Chinese government subsequently enacted drastic policies in an attempt to stabilize the country, though this only paved the way to its gradual demise. Authorities are largely fragmented and unsuccessful in maintaining order, causing uprisings in numerous regions throughout the country. Eventually, in 20█, the Communist government was overthrown and was replaced with a federal, democratic government, claiming to be the successor to the Communist Party, with the support of the Chinese government in exile, the Republic of China (Taiwan or ROC for short).

Despite numerous rebels and coups aiming to restore the power to communists, the Chinese Federation was declared and recognized as the legitimate successor to the Communist government by the United Nations. Soon after, the Nationalist (ROC) government was integrated into the new federal government and was able to once again restore order and peace to China. 

The five-starred flag was lowered in Beijing for the last time and was replaced with a historical flag (which resembles a modified flag of the Republic of China, known as the “blue and white well \[on a red field\] flag"").

Referendums held in 20█ have led to the independence of Tibet, Xinjiang (East Turkistan or Ugyhuristan), Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. Inner Mongolia (or South Mongolia) was transferred to Mongolian rule as a highly autonomous region.

In other words, China would basically become similar to Russian Federation after the collapse of the USSR as we now know today.

I will release a map showing the different “states"" of  the Chinese Federation under a federal government. Feel free to express criticism and feedback on my piece.

Glory to Hong Kong."
