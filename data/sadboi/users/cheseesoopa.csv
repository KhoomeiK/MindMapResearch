One time I was having so much anxiety cause it was super busy and I was waiting a while for a chance to go and I finally saw a chance but I ended up hitting the gas too hard and I turned my wheel way too much and the car in the other lane was pretty close to me. That was pretty scary, so now I try not to worry too much about the people behind me and just focus on being safe and making sure it‚Äôs completely ok for me to make the turn.

The whole rest of the car ride I have having chest pains due to anxiety and I get jittery as well.

I prefer to drive at night because the roads are less busy and so are stores. What makes me uncomfortable is the fact that people can see me I guess, like if I were able to get tinted windows (it‚Äôs illegal where I‚Äôm at), I would probably feel better about driving.
