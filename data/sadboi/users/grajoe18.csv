BPD,fp3op8h,t3_gazy08,1588283047.0,"I completely understand how it feels, I'm going through it right now with a partner I'd been with for two weeks. I ended up breaking it off but the night after I got drunk and I've been trying not to fall back into drinking and cutting. I'm glad I left because they weren't good for me and used me but at the same time its killing me and I want things back the way they were."
