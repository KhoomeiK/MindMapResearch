Apparently since I am bipolar I can't have any kind of emotions or feelings lol. Like wtf when did that happen cause no Dr has ever told me I couldn't feel lol. It's so fuc**** annoying! Also I haven't had manic episodes in several years and all of a sudden I'm having them pretty frequently. Anybody else notice an increase since all this craziness started?"

I understand way they're running away, and everyone of them I have talked to says the same thing, and that's that they're trying to get away from it. I sympathize I do but they don't know if they even have it and if they do, they're carrying it with them everywhere they go. Alot of people around us are not listening, and they're making fun of the situation cause they say everybody is exaggerating, and then other's say they simply dont care and they're gonna continue to live their life. It's pissing me off so bad! This is not gonna get better until people start taking this seriously, and they're gonna cause alot of people to get sick and die. It's infuriating. I will keep you in my prayers. I am so sorry you're going through this, especially since you're one of the one's trying to do right :("
JUSTNOFAMILY,flir8x8,t1_fliqcvp,1585188809.0,"Trust me I know I have 2 brother's that are career criminals and I use to feel the same way you do until they robbed me blind. Your situation is more difficult though because my daughter is in nursing school and I know how strict they are and how particular they are when hiring, and she's already screwed you out of 2 potential job's and I would hate for her to screw you out of even being able to get your nursing license. Sometimes people need tough love, and she's taking advantage of you and continuing to do these thing's because she doesn't think you'll ever turn her in, cause you love her. You're the only 1 that can stop this and you sound like a very sweet, and loving person and you have a good life ahead as long as she don't ruin it. I remember how strict they were on background checks when I was just a CNA, and I know how hard they are on nurses. They hold you all at a very high standard. Your mom is enabling her too and taking up for her when she does these thing's to you. You may need to take a long look at these relationships and see if they're even beneficial to you, or if they're just hurting you and go no contact with them for a while. Don't let her ruin your future before it even gets started! Put your foot down and teach her actions have consequences. I'm sorry you have to go through this but you gotta stop it now, and you are gonna feel so much better when you do ‚ù§"

I've been impulsive with money so I got myself behind but I'm thinking of maybe turning my finances over to my mom until I get straightened out. I need to do something cause the stress and worry over this pandemic is making me crazy lol. I work with the public and it's really kicking up in my area so I'm petrified of working with the public. I just wish I could get my brain to cooperate!
JUSTNOFAMILY,fle7wlt,t1_flatymz,1585079258.0,You could call the Health Department and let them know this and maybe they can intervene
BipolarReddit,fldsizz,t1_flc0pgd,1585070855.0,All this stuff about the pandemic and it's getting real bad in my state and in scared to death. I work with the public part time and I'm an essential business so I come in contact with so many people. I needed the money cause I'm having a hard time living off of just my disability. My family wants me to quit until this is over but I think I would drive myself insane if I did.
BipolarReddit,fldsa38,t1_flc1bza,1585070720.0,I wonder if that person actually had bipolar disorder to begin with. I've seen alot of different psychiatrist's over the year's and they all said this disease requires medication. My friends daughter refuses to be medicated and that poor girl is suffering so bad with it. Psych meds have alot of side effects but I can definitely feel the difference when I forget to take them and it's never good. I get really bad. I wish I had the answers though.
BipolarReddit,fldrsaj,t1_flc63jw,1585070447.0,"You're welcome. I think one of my meds is messing with me too, cause I completely lost all motivation when I started taking it. Idk about you but I dwell on certain thing's, and right now it's this virus. I keep trying to not pay attention to it but I'm compulsive about it at this point. Like I literally will obsess over thing's that I can't change and I can't help it. I need to get back outside more too cause sunshine and activity are so good for us."
BipolarReddit,flb1m8n,t1_fl8r3r0,1584995513.0,"Are you in therapy and do you have a psychiatrist, and are you medicated? If not those thing's are so important, and crucial when you have this disease. It does get better but they gotta get you on the right meds and it does take time. Therapy is vital and if you're still in this kind of state you may wanna look into getting impatient treatment for a bit so they can monitor you, talk to you and find the right medication for you. It can be controlled and even when it is you still good day's and bad day's but with therapy you can find the tools to get you through those day's. Find something you enjoy that will help too. Exercise is wonderful and can help you stay level. I know that's easier said than done cause some day's I literally can't make myself do anything, not even shower. If it comes to having to apply for disability do not be ashamed. I had to go on disability at 27 because my symptoms were so bad I wasn't able to work anymore. Even when I'm feeling great I still can't work because my symptoms get out of control again. If you're not doing any of these please please please look into therapy. Alot of people don't wanna be medication and I didn't either, but I knew I had to cause I wasn't getting better and I understand I'm always gonna have to be on medication cause I know what it feels like when I'm not. The proper medication is essential in getting your symptoms under control so please look into this stuff it will help you so much. Good luck and my heart goes out to you. I know what you're going through though."
BipolarReddit,flb093c,t1_fl8jm6o,1584994716.0,"I think it just comes with the territory. Look at what I wrote about this and see if you can relate any. It is scary but don't let it define you. There's such a stigma that comes along with having this shit. You're newly diagnosed but I want you to remember 1 thing and that is this is not your fault. We were just dealt a shit hand. I was like that for a long time and I had to go on disability cause mine was so bad. I'm 41 now and if anybody asks me why I'm on disability I usually tell them because of my back cause I've got of back problems and I'm in chronic pain all the time. I use to get so embarrassed when I had to tell somebody or anytime someone would ask why I'm on disability. I don't get too embarrassed anymore unless I'm already in a bad mood but it use to make me feel like such a failure because before I got diagnosed I had a good job and made great money running my own business and I was only 27 at the Time. I had always had some issues with depression but the bipolar didn't start surfacing until my dad committed suicide, and my husband got sick. I was trying to deal with all of that and I was in so much pain from losing my dad like that, and I thought I was just grieving. Wrong! I went on about a 3 year nervous breakdown and that's when it reared it's ugly head. I guess it was always there I had symptoms and just didn't realize it cause they were pretty mild until all that happened and they came out full force. Idk what I'm trying to say exactly but I know what you're saying and I have felt that way. I'm sure most people here have at some point. Just please like I said don't let it define you, and don't let it make you feel like there's something wrong with you, and don't feel like you're any less than anybody else. This is a sucky ass disease but most of us suffering with it are great people, with Huge hearts and we love people so much, sometimes more than they deserve. Our brains are just out of whack. Don't let it defeat you and find someone you can confide in cause this disease will isolate you if you let it. Good luck and I don't know you but much love to you‚ù§ I'm sorry you're feeling this way and I wish I could help but it does get better. It's never easy but it's manageable. Self care is huge too! Find thing's you enjoy to try and take your mind off of it. Exercise and sunlight are so important and they can elevate your moods so much. Self care is so important so don't forget that!"
BipolarReddit,flay3i3,t1_fl86p2y,1584993467.0,"I feel this so much! I was diagnosed 12 year's ago and I've been on medication since. I have had to change meds so many time's I can't even keep up with it anymore. My bipolar has been absolutely off the charts these last few weeks. I'm having symptoms I haven't had in year's and I assume it's because of everything that's going on right now triggering them and it fucking sucks! I'm having manic episodes again that last for day's at a time. I'm always rapid cycling these day's so my moods are all over the place, and when I have a manic episode the crash is so bad! I had one this weekend that lasted from Friday until today but I actually feel pretty good today cause I didn't get the bad crash this time that I have been getting. I was awake from 9am Friday till 2am this morning on Monday. I don't usually ask for help but I needed somebody to talk to so bad Saturday night cause I am so worried about everything that's going on and there was nobody. Idk about you but it's hard to talk to my family because anytime I'm worried about something like I have been or I'm stressed the first thing they say is "" It's just the bipolar, take your meds"" or my ALL TIME FAVORITE, ""stop worrying about stuff like that you're just crazy!"" They don't call me crazy to be mean so let me emphasize that, but they say it trying to make light of the subject I guess? I hate it! It makes me mad and it makes me feel stupid cause anytime I am worried or stressed, or have any kind of feelings they make me feel like they're not legit feelings or worries, cause it's ""just the bipolar"" Yes I am bipolar but these are legitimate fears and worries! Does anyone else's family act like that towards you too? I didn't know that just because I'm bipolar I wasn't allowed to be scared or worry about anything? Apparently I didn't get that memo. I wish they would look at me and see as a person and not as my illness. Does that make sense? I am genuinely scared out of my mind right now about everything that's happening because I love these people so much and I'm so scared of what could happen to them right now. I think that's a good reason to be scared and so do most other people in the world. I don't see why they don't understand that. I hate being bipolar. I hate even telling people that I have it, cause it's like that's all they see when they look at me. I am bipolar and I hate it and I can't stand the thought of anybody else having to suffer with this shit, but that's just a small part of me and I'm tired of feeling like it's what defines me cause it's not. Anyway I feel everything you said and I don't know you but I can relate to what you're going through and I'm sorry you're having a hard time too. It feels so lonely sometimes that's for sure."
opiates,flahkby,t1_fl9e4r2,1584984012.0,"They really don't. I had a wonderful GYN though and he tried everything to make me feel better, and even with all the surgeries it would start raging again. My hysterectomy was supposed to be like 1 to 1 1/2 Hours but I was on the table for over 7 cause the adhesions and stuff were so bad that my internal organs had detached and reattached to other organs so they had to get everything put back where they belonged. With me I think my addiction is more from compulsion at this point, cause when I get them I get so compulsive that I literally can't stay out of them. I take and take and take until they're all gone. I know that sounds stupid but that's what I think. I'm doing ok so far and reminding myself that I am in control not the pills. I'm gonna get it right cause I want it. You got it in you too. It's either let it beat us or get up and kick it's ass and I'm ready to kick it's ass!"
opiates,fl8mqyk,t1_fl8lsm5,1584927295.0,"I have I have given them to my mom but she gives in to me to and gives them back lol. That's my fault though cause I asked her to put them up and then turned right around and wanted her to get 2 or 3 more every 30 minutes or whatever. Someone suggested that I give them to her and buy a cheap lockbox with a code and only she can know the code so I think I'm gonna try that. I just got them today and so far I've done good cause I've only taken 7 and I'm prescribed 6 a day so I went over by 1, but usually the 1st 24 hours I go through 30-40 so I would say that's a drastic improvement lol. I'm gonna give it everything I got this time and then some cause I'm tired of it. Good luck to you too and I'll keep you in prayers. Just wanted to let you know when I saw this post just how much alike are circumstances are. It's nice to know somebody understands sometimes."
BipolarReddit,fl82xnj,t3_fn1up5,1584914780.0,"I was looking so hard for a post like this lastnight cause I never ask for help but I needed someone like me to talk to so bad! My mania has been controlled for a good while now until here lately. I was use to the occasional mixed episodes but now it is full blown manic episodes!   I started a new job and I have to work 3rd shift 2 night's a week and idk if it's because my sleep pattern has gotten so out of whack or what, but that's when they started again. I'm sure you know one of the big thing's that helps is a good sleep routine and I finally had one and now it's all messed up. I had the worse manic episode this weekend and I've now been awake since 9am friday, to now and it's 6pm Sunday so I'm getting ready to crash. I've been having alot of mixed episodes too. Another thing I think set me off so bad this weekend is everything that's going on around us and taking in all this information, and I am so scared out of my mind about all of it. We tend to feel thing's more deeply than alot of people, at least I know I do I can't speak for you, but I'm like a sponge! I absorb everything and I feel thing's so deep. My therapist seems to think I'm an empath cause I feel other people's emotions so strong! Wether I know them or not, and I work with the public and I have alot of regular customers and alot of travelers and I've been talking to all these people all week and I've seen the sadness and despair in them, especially the one's that have lost their jobs this week and all of it is just breaking my heart and scaring me to death at the same time. We're seeing alot of fighting and greed and stupidity around here too cause our grocery stores are bare almost right after they open, and alot of people are left feeling so helpless because they can't even find their basic necessities right now. I don't understand why people are hoarding these thing's, and buying all this food to the point where people who barely live week to week can find enough of anything for even a day or two. I guess I hit my limit finally cause I just had to walk outside and cry a couple time's Thursday because I got so overwhelmed, and the Manic episode came on, on Sunday. This has all just been so much to try and take in and absorb and seeing all the craziness and sadness is taking it's toll on everybody that has an ounce of humanity in them. Not so much the one's who don't give a shit, and tell you they don't give a shit and they're not listening and putting so many people in danger and that's just exacerbating everything. I could go on and on but I think that's what happened to me and caused the manic episode and the extreme mood swings. It's a very very hard time to be bipolar right now! Not that it's ever easy but it seems to be making it extra hard for people like me and you to cope on a healthy level. You can probably tell I'm still a little manic cause I'm rambling on so bad and I'm sorry about that lol. If you made it this far thank's for listening and your post really helped. I don't want anybody to have to go through this but at the same time it's nice to know there's somebody there going thru the same or similar that understands. My family tries so hard but they don't live with it so don't understand it very much, and lord I love them but I get so tired of them telling me just take your meds and you're only feeling that way because of the bipolar when I have any kind of feeling and emotion about something! It drives me crazy! I want them to see me as a regular person instead of a disorder cause that's not what defines me. It gets exhausting though lol."

opiates,fl7yylz,t3_fn03lj,1584912373.0,"I am almost in the same boat as you. I'm a chronic pain patient also with severe endometriosis too. I've had 8 surgeries and finally just had to have a hysterectomy a few year's when I was only 34 but I couldn't handle it anymore. They fail to tell you that it can actually still grow and cause lesions and adhesions even after a hysterectomy, and I can tell thing's are still going on with it. I use to do great with my meds until it got so bad and I started taking a few more here, a few more there and real quick I was addicted to something I had already been on for a few year's. I think the depression after the hysterectomy contributed to it too. I go to PM and I get alot of Roxy's every month, and definitely enough to be pretty comfortable just taking the correct dose, but I'm out in a week and then I suffer all month. I've been trying to get it in check and do right again for a while now but it's not that easy as you know. I am gonna give it 150% this time cause I am so tired of living like this. This is no life, and it's not the life I want. The thing is I know that and I actually mean it but when I get them it's like a compulsion to keep taking and taking until they're all gone. I am gonna give it my absolute hardest try ever this month and damnit I hope to hell I get it right this time. Life was so much better before I let this control me. You know you want it as bad as I do so we need to want to get better even more than we ever wanted to be high, and we gotta chase it until we get it right. It will happen. I don't know you but I believe in you, and you sound like you're ready, so keep going and don't ever give up. You got this!"

I was gonna say easier but I don't think easier is the right word when you love someone so much. It just amazes me how some people know this stuff before they go.

I got called a selfish bitch and all kinds of other very nasty thing's and all I said was it was sad and I wished something could be done to get it. I was told I needed to worry about everyone else that this wish could put in danger and I can't even remember all of it, but it was bad, nasty, and some were downright viscous."
TrueOffMyChest,fl7bnx8,t3_fmwwtl,1584898424.0,"Wow! I felt like I wrote this myself cause this is exactly what I've been feeling this week but also add in extreme sadness and depression cause I work with the public too, and in a very busy area that sees alot of traveler's, and it's a gas station so it's considered an essential business. Pretty much like you, a slave to a big corporation that think's were disposable, and not worth taking much effort to protect from this shit. I totally relate to this on every level. My regular customers are amazing and we love them, and they love us so I'm trying to hang in there for them too. We're a friend of sorts and we ask about each other's day, and how we're dealing with everything and god it's breaking my heart cause several have gotten laid off this week because of everything and these jobs are all they have known. Seeing them almost in tears and most are older adult men is killing me. I hate to see anybody like this and I make conversation with everybody cause I want them to know at least someone cares and cares enough to see how they're doing. I have had so many emotions this week and rage has been a huge one for me too, cause I'm also seeing all these travelers from all these different states and I know I'm probably coming into contact with it soon if I haven't already and there's a personal cost for me too. I worry so much that I'm gonna take it home to my family and 2 of my daughter's have very bad asthma, and my mom is getting older too. She's 62. I also have had to make the excruciating decision to not be able to see my sweet little grandbaby cause she's only 2, and she's so little. I have been there with her almost daily since birth and I cannot stand the thought that I could cause her to get sick and also my own little girl and she's only 8. Nobody knows how long this is gonna go on cause so many people ARE NOT LISTENING and social distancing and it's gonna keep me away from 2 of the people that I love more than anything in this world and that's my grandbaby and my daughter, her mommy. This sucks! It sucks for everyone but the people not listening and not caring about what they're exposing anybody else to is infuriating and it's not fair. We're gonna end up paying a huge price for their poor decisions. Add in the hoarders, price gougers and the other dumbasses that think they have to take everything so nobody else can have any so they can fill up on everything for months cause they have more money and are able to. The rest of us live week to week and are scrimping to be able to find anything to even last for a few day's cause it's all gone. And so help me God if I hear one more person tell us working in retail that we don't need sanitizer cause the government says washing your hands is best so we don't need sanitizer I'm gonna lose my shit! Yes I wash my hands so many times a day they're actually sore cause I'm washing them on a very compulsive level, but you know as well as I do you can't always get to a sink with soap and water when you're constantly waiting on people. It's nice to know you can find even a small bottle to keep close by when it's hard to get away to have a little added protection and frankly just to make myself feel just a little bit safer. Idk how much more I'm gonna be able to take of this shit. I wanna be safe too and I damn sure wanna keep my family safe."

BipolarReddit,fl75syr,t1_fl6kk92,1584894882.0,"Also if thing's are affecting you bad right now and making you more symptomatic I hope you feel better and get through it quick and easy as possible. I haven't had to deal with mania for a long time but I've been out of meds for a week and I never do that, then everything else has made my symptoms pretty bad this week. I hope you're not feeling like that too. I don't know anybody that's bipolar so I don't have anybody I can talk it through while I'm like this, cause you know people can't really understand how hard it can be on us if they've never had to live with it. My daughter tries but when I get like this or even upset over anything she goes straight to telling me it's just the bipolar lol. She means well though she just don't get it lol"
OpiateChurch,fl75dkm,t1_fl71vrh,1584894612.0,I've heard about that alot lately but wasn't sure what it was. I can't remember what you said about taking the Roxy's too close to the subs? I got sick almost right after I did them though. Does PW's happen when you take a sub too soon after oxy or the other way around? I just got sick as a dog though
BipolarReddit,fl6zek9,t1_fl6ycbe,1584889034.0,"Thank you, and you too. Should I delete that? Idk why I feel so bad because of it. Maybe cause I'm a little manic you think?

OpiateChurch,fl6zacy,t1_fl6xu3t,1584888899.0,I believe it that's why I don't mess with them too much but I did not know any of the stuff you just said lol. You did good cause I hear most people are on like 12-16 and higher doses to start out! Damn no wonder they're staying sick for so long. I got sick a few time's after taking them but 1 time in particular stick's out cause I had taken 2 like maybe 5 hours apart cause the girl I got them from said that's what she would do and omg I was so sick! I could barely get out of bed cause I was so sick so I either took way too much or I got PW'S or both lol cause I didn't even know what PW'S were till just this last year and when I got sick like that it's probably about 3 year's ago.

heroin,fl6xllh,t1_fl6qmvi,1584886954.0,"I wouldn't do that. I don't know enough about them to give advice to anybody about it. People usually say to wait at least 24 hours so it don't happen and I had never even heard of them until probably like in the last year and I've been going through withdrawals for the biggest part of the month every month since I got addicted and just recently figured out what they were talking about. I imagine I've probably been through them at least a couple times and just thought they were really shittier withdrawals than normal, cause some of them have been hell to say the least until I found Kratom a couple year's ago. I definitely would never give out advice about them though cause I'm sure you can tell I don't know that much about them or I would have known it was the bupe not the naloxone that caused them lol. That's why I came here cause I knew if anybody could help me out and teach me a thing or 2 it would be someone on here. I got downvoted up above for some reason lol. Maybe cause I hopped in on somebody's post? I'm still pretty dumb to reddit and reddit's rules too lol so I'm sorry if I pissed someone off cause I asked for help on their post, I just didn't know what to do. Thank you for teaching me a little more about it though. I never wanna go on subs though cause everyone I know of that's been on them says it takes month's to really get through the withdrawals from them so I know I couldn't handle that very well. Withdrawing from oxy before I found Kratom was torture enough!"

BipolarReddit,fl6ia16,t3_fmvmgc,1584870144.0,I don't remember anything like that but I also wasn't paying attention cause I didn't there was anything wrong with me but hell yes there was and everyone saw it but me.

heroin,fl6a9kg,t1_fl69g2j,1584860082.0,"Thank you. I have never had a subutex either. The only time I ever went into PW'S was when I had blew through over 300mgs in one day and took a sub about 8 hours later. I assume that's what it was cause I had never heard of PW'S before and I was sick as a dog lol. Still not sure if that was even pw's cause I was still pretty dumb about all of it at that point lol. I hear people telling people all the time who are looking for help with withdrawals say they're gonna get it no matter what, and it's awful and it happens anytime you take a sub too soon and scares the hell out of them, but I can and have many times taken 300+ mgs of Roxy's and took a sub 8 hours later and never got them. I have taken oxys then Kratom, and subs on top of the Kratom just hours after having the oxys and I don't get them for some reason. The one time I thought might have actually been PW'S I didn't know anything about it and knowing my stupid self I probably took many subs lol. Go big or go home right? That's what I do anyway lol. You would think I would have learned by now but in 6 year's it still hasn't kicked in lol. I think I took 2 whole strips that day like 4-5 hours apart and that was the 1st time I has ever had a sub, so yea probably just over did it lol. Thank's for the advice. I've messed around with H for a while and how I never got fully addicted I'll never know but damn I can't kick the Roxy's. That's my vice lol."

heroin,fl68asw,t1_fl6745j,1584857914.0,That sucks lol. As long as I can still feel them a little I'll live. Usually I take so many I don't see how they can't break through it lol. I don't know much about subs either but I do know what PW'S are though cause I learned that the hard way Haha.
heroin,fl673zb,t1_fl665qd,1584856682.0,"Also I went ahead and took it cause I wasn't sure if I would get a reply but I only took half of it so I guess that would be 4mg in pill form? Not sure cause I usually take the strips, but 12hrs from now will I have any benefit from the Roxy's? It's the 1st sub I've taken in a couple weeks so I don't have alot built up in my system."

He was born with a very bad heart but he also had a stroke and it got to the point it was time to get a hospital bed for him. He told me the day we went to get it that if he got in that bed he would be dead soon. He was gone the very next day. Sometimes, somehow they just know. I am sorry about your uncle, and so sorry for your loss. Maybe that's how he chose he wanted to go?"

AmItheAsshole,fl342zc,t1_fl2zdhh,1584768140.0,"Thank you so much. At the time I didn't think I would ever get over it and of course well meaning would tell me to just be grateful for the one's I had, it still hurt like hell. I loved my baby's the from the second I found out I was carrying them. Your right every loss has it's challenges no matter what significance other people put on them. I never understood either why some people think miscarriages are nothing. They're very painful and your left with all questions and no answers. I will say that if I ever lost one of my daughter's I don't think I would come back from that kind of grief. They're both a big deal I never wanna know what the other feels like."
AmItheAsshole,fl2xjnf,t1_fl2w8hh,1584762572.0,I got my ass reemed so bad earlier cause I made the simple comment that I thought it was terrible people in hospitals and nursing homes were having to die alone cause they wouldn't let in visitors. I didn't say I didn't understand why they weren't I just said it was sad and nobody should have to die alone. Damn they lit into my ass so bad lol.

AmItheAsshole,fl2s3n1,t1_fl1g66j,1584758479.0,Agreed. Again idk why you're getting downvoted so much. I agree losing one of my children now would be phenomenally worse than my miscarriages though. I don't think I would be able to survive losing one of my daughter's. Miscarriage definitely still hurts though. The 2 may not be comparable but they definitely still hurt.
AmItheAsshole,fl2rlc9,t1_fl1kfng,1584758123.0,Idk why you're getting downvoted so much cause what you said is true.
AmItheAsshole,fl2pyk8,t1_fl27gwb,1584756962.0,"Thank you for saying this. I had 3 miscarriages and I also have 3 living children and losing them would by far be worse, but that doesn't take away the loss that I felt and had to live with. The wondering what they would have been like, and the dream's they would have. The constant wondering if I did something to cause me to lose them. It's devastating. Not the same by any means but at the time I can guarantee it almost feels like it."
AmItheAsshole,fl2pgas,t1_fl2fw4b,1584756610.0,"I am so sorry for your loss. That is so unfair and I can only imagine the pain and grief you have had to go through. I had 3 miscarriages and they hurt so much, but I couldn't even imagine having a stillborn. That's just devastating. I am so sorry."
AmItheAsshole,fl2pagb,t1_fl29sy9,1584756496.0,Having a stillborn would definitely have been alot harder on me than my miscarriages. Having to birth a dead baby is so unfair and I don't know how women recover from that.
AmItheAsshole,fl2oz7q,t3_flz4st,1584756277.0,"NTA. I have had 3 miscarriages and it was unbearable but they were still my children. On the other hand I also have 3 living children and it would absolutely kill me if I lost one of them. I miss what could have been with the 3 I lost and I often wonder what they would be like if they had lived, but the other 3 are alive, and we know and love each other, and have shared a life together and my worst fear is losing one of them. Don't discount her miscarriage though cause it still hurts especially if it's a recent loss, but there's no way I could even compare the 2 now. Her baby didn't make it but it was very much her child."

BipolarReddit,fl2ldou,t1_fl22n4w,1584753795.0,Thank you so much. It's hard that's for sure. I got diagnosed in my late 20's after my dad committed suicide cause that's when it really began to surface. There were unfortunately a few year's where they just couldn't do anything with me cause I had gotten so out there and I was grieving and angry which is a bad combo. I'm hoping I can try to ho back to school when my 8year old gets a little bigger. I just wish I could find the right med combo! I wish you all the success and happiness in the world ‚ù§

dating_advice,fl282yn,t3_fm3cw9,1584745040.0,You're good looking so it's definitely not your looks. Maybe women notice you but you don't see it? Maybe you need to open yourself up a little more? It don't sound like you have much faith in yourself either. Open up and strike up a conversation with them and put yourself out there a little.
AmItheAsshole,fl232p3,t3_flzg1o,1584741836.0,NAH. Maybe she's sad cause she missed out on growing up with you and never being able to meet her bio mom. I could understand her being sad about that and unfortunately it's something she's gonna have to come to terms with on her own. You are only a year apart so I completely understand how she could be questioning why your mother wanted you but not her too. I'm sure there are many thing's that she is struggling with. I'm sorry you had a bad life growing up and it definitely sounds like it was pretty hard but try to see where she is coming from too. Apologize and tell her why you said what you said but also ask her why she feels the way she does and open up that communication with her. I imagine too that maybe she feels jealous cause you got to stay and you had a relationship with your mother and now that chance isn't even available to her cause she's gone now. The two of you really need to have a heart to heart. Good luck and just try to be a little sympathetic cause she's dealing with alot of emotions too.

AmItheAsshole,fl21las,t1_fl0um2q,1584740897.0,"If I acted like that then I suspect my daughter wouldn't tell me when she gets married either. My daughter has been talking about getting married at the courthouse and then saving for the wedding they want and I told her that was fine with me but I would really really love to be there. She promised she would tell me if that's what they decide, but the day she turned 18 I knew I was no longer in charge of her. She's a grown woman. She's almost 23 now with a baby of her own and I would not dare try and tell her what she can and can't do with her life. The person that said the dad is treating her like his property was spot on. I was a daddy's girl so I talked to mine about everything too but he didn't treat me like OP'S dad has treated her, just like I'm sure your dad didn't treat you that way either. People like him think's it has to be their way or no way at all, and that is how you end up alienating your family."
AmItheAsshole,fl1zvkq,t3_flvl4f,1584739829.0,"NTA. It almost sounds like she wanted you to finally agree with her that she needed to have them done. Kinda like she was trying to assuage you into agreeing with her and then getting upset cause you did. I'm a female and that's what it sounds like to me. She's projecting her insecurities onto you and when you finally agreed she got upset. I think you just need to tell her again that you love her and think she's beautiful just the way she is, and you were only agreeing with her cause you thought that's what she wanted you to do. That's what it sounds like to me anyway. Like she wanted a reason to get upset? Some girls are like that. I use to be really small and I gained some weight after having a hysterectomy and I just in the past year finally lost 65 lbs. I'm about 15 away from my goal weight but I'm happy lol. I also know that after losing that amount of weight you need to work out and firm thing's back up a little. Does she go to the gym and is that something you could do together? Working out really boosts my self esteem when it gets low. Maybe that's what she needs."

I don't mind sharing but stuff like that is expensive anyway and I ain't got the money for other people to use it all up and end up having to buy more.

I've been a single mother for the last 12 year's and was pretty much doing it on my own a long time before that cause my husband was very sick. He passed away 12 years ago so I had to raise my oldest 2 girl's from the ages 11 and 13. They're adults now and doing wonderful but the teenage year's of my middle daughter I really thought were gonna be the death of me lol but we made it. I never called on anyone else to help me discipline her cause she was MY responsibility not anybody else's. I have an 8 year old now too and for some reason her daddy leaves the discipline up to me too. I think that's because he don't wanna be the bad guy but anyway she's your mom's child, so she's her responsibility. Is dad not in the picture?"
