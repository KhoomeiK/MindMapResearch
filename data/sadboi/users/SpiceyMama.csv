changemyview,fqxor3o,t1_fqxmwie,1589735584.0,A parody of an action movie and the poor writing and poor soundtrack you could compare to a director intentionally writing terribly as a means to make it funny. There are a lot of movies and shows that do this Children‚Äôs Hospital.
insaneparents,fkbdgz5,t3_fhevh2,1584030967.0,As a mom and fellow person with depression and anxiety this makes me sad. Passing your classes when you are depressed is incredibly difficult! It‚Äôs hard to even get out of bed let alone study and do homework. I would cry too if I were you because that‚Äôs an accomplishment!! You are awesome and will do great things! Take it one day at a time and know that there are internet strangers and people around you that love you and care about you. Best of luck. ‚ù§Ô∏è

JustNoSO,fcsjbox,t1_fcr9ok9,1577917696.0,I‚Äôm so sorry to hear about your sister! My husband has bipolar I and can go from being over the top happy to irritable and angry out of the blue. It‚Äôs common with mania to be easily agitated.
JustNoSO,fcsj4na,t1_fcr0i89,1577917545.0,Thank you! I appreciate the kind words. I have pretty severe ADHD along with anxiety and depression so I can relate when he is anxious or depressed. Before his diagnosis I didn‚Äôt have much patience because I thought he was just being an asshole. Since then he‚Äôs been on medication which has improved the illness. My family thinks I‚Äôm nuts for ‚Äúputting up‚Äù with him but I love him the way he is even when he‚Äôs difficult haha!
JustNoSO,fcqtsm5,t3_eii4y9,1577892087.0,This sounds like my husband and he has bipolar disorder and more than likely obsessive compulsive personality disorder as he has all the symptoms but hasn‚Äôt brought it up to his doctor yet. He will be in a great mood then it‚Äôs the flip of a switch and something small ruins his mood for the rest of the day. It isn‚Äôt your fault. My husband has told me that when he gets like that it‚Äôs not my fault and he‚Äôs having his own internal battle that has nothing to do with me. It doesn‚Äôt excuse the behavior but it does explain it.

AMA,fclgzmb,t1_fcl2xqg,1577747571.0,Definitely the water birth. Labor was easier even though it was longer and there weren‚Äôt any complications. Plus I felt better after birth than I did when I had the epidural.

AMA,fckyujb,t1_fckxxyj,1577736130.0,At the time I was a nanny and the mom told me that she had both a birth without an epidural and one with an epidural. She said that the one without an epidural was a better experience with less complications and quicker recovery. I decided to look into it which lead me to finding a midwife and introduced to the option of a water birth. I‚Äôm happy I did it. It was painful of course but a lot less painful than being on the bed since the warm water eased a lot of the pain. It was really cool picking my daughter up out of the water and having that moment of holding her after all that hard work. We also got it on video which was awesome! When I birthed my son we weren‚Äôt allowed to get a video because I had an epidural and the hospital had a new policy against video recording which was really lame.
AMA,fckxvvn,t1_fckns8f,1577735540.0,You can‚Äôt have an epidural if you have a water birth. However I did have an epidural when I gave birth to my son since the hospital stopping allowing water births shortly after I had my daughter.
AMA,fckxsx5,t1_fckleg8,1577735489.0,I gave birth to my daughter in a jacuzzi at the hospital. The hospital allowed water births when i delivered my daughter but they ended up being bought out by a different branch which doesn‚Äôt allow them so I had it with my daughter but not my son.

AMA,fc5m0g9,t3_dtfz1l,1577461145.0,I read a good portion of the comments and I‚Äôm pretty fascinated. I have always been a huge fan of knowing how our brains work and why we act and think the way we do. I have poor impulse control and boredom is pretty much my middle name as I have severe ADHD. Do you find it hard to cure your boredom and do you have hobbies you don‚Äôt get sick of? For me that‚Äôs my biggest and most annoying struggle is finding something to do that keeps me engaged and doesn‚Äôt get boring quickly. How does your family feel about your diagnosis? And one last question: Do you ever feel excited about anything? I remember I dated a guy who never showed excitement and looking back his face and expressions mirrored Dexter. I think it would be a blessing and a curse. A blessing to not be an overly emotional person but a curse to have to pretend all the time.
AMA,fc5ejuc,t1_fc5cycj,1577455248.0,It was fun but I regret drinking as much as I did. It was over the top and I missed out on a lot due to my partying. Now I have a glass or 2 of wine a couple time a year...how things have changed haha

Growing up my family was upper middle class (income between $300-400,000). They are ended up unemployed due to the market crash in 2008 so they had to foreclose on our house and went from upper middle class to middle class bordering on lower middle class over night. Although it was nice getting pretty much anything I wanted as a kid it hasn‚Äôt done me any favors as an adult. It took years to finally feel like I can survive without relying on my parents for things. Do you have this problem as well or did your parents make you work for what you wanted?"

LetsReadOfficial,fc3sgu1,t1_fc3rgih,1577397476.0,Definitely! I was making poor choices when I was in my early 20s in that I partied too much but Dennis was the only person to take advantage of me when plenty of other guys would have had an opportunity.

LetsNotMeet,fbzpvue,t1_fbylv9d,1577255685.0,It was scary for me at the time because he would go crazy and blow up my husband when he didn‚Äôt get his way.

AskReddit,f1mjluq,t3_d9z3m0,1569595432.0,I feel this way a lot of the time. I like being around my husband and kids but other than that going out and socializing is so mentally exhausting for me. I‚Äôm perfectly happy being at home working on a puzzle. I‚Äôve noticed after big social events I become depressed due to being overstimulated.
bipolar,f0vyk7v,t1_f0vrlto,1568994873.0,Someone mentioned having borderline personality disorder and that she behaved similar to my husband. I think it is a possibility but he isn‚Äôt overly jealous which I hear is part of it.
bipolar,f0vw2ip,t1_f0vrlto,1568993179.0,Today he said that he didn‚Äôt think he was being mean and said he was just pointing out things he noticed needed done. He doesn‚Äôt think he did anything wrong and said I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong when he was addressing things that he noticed. We do rip on each other for fun a lot but the ‚Äújokes‚Äù mentioned in the post didn‚Äôt seem like a joke to me and upset me. He said he didn‚Äôt mean to upset me and he genuinely forgets that some things are offensive to me. I get that portion because my god he will tell me something a million times and I still forget (yay ADHD).
bipolar,f0uuj9b,t1_f0uu8l9,1568951228.0,I really appreciate you saying this. I‚Äôm happy to hear you‚Äôre doing much better. I hope my husband can get better too. His therapist invited me to join a therapy session with him. I‚Äôm hoping that will have a positive impact.
bipolar,f0l32qv,t3_d46ed3,1568696550.0,Lol Abilify worked sooo well for my husband but the extreme restlessness was super uncomfortable for him so he had to switch. Wellbutrin made him lose touch with reality and super angry out of the blue but came to find out that it‚Äôs terrible for people with bipolar disorder so once he got his diagnosis he went off of it. üôå

bipolar,exi2kd0,t1_exi1y85,1566319719.0,Thanks for the feedback! He takes his meds every day and he doesn‚Äôt drink like he used to. He was getting drunk every day last year but since the new year he only has 2 beers maximum. Hopefully the Depakote works.

askwomenadvice,ew5si6b,t3_cmwmdp,1565143997.0,If you are hiding it from her then that means you‚Äôre afraid she‚Äôll leave you due to your views. Don‚Äôt waste your time or hers by keeping this a secret. I openly talk politics with friends and family because I‚Äôm very passionate about my stances. I don‚Äôt think I could be with someone who is on the opposite side of the political spectrum. Thankfully my husband and I agree on everything politically which makes election season easier and more enjoyable because we watch the debates together and have gone to a rally together as well.
bipolar,ew5qmas,t1_ew5ptwv,1565142682.0,I‚Äôll definitely talk to him about broaching the subject of a symptom tracker. He doesn‚Äôt know a lot about bipolar disorder. I have looked into it a lot so I can be more understanding. He said he doesn‚Äôt know when he‚Äôs manic. I think he‚Äôs rapid cycling because his moods change quickly so I don‚Äôt know who to expect. I think he‚Äôs also frustrated because he‚Äôs tried out 4 different meds for it and only one worked really well (Abilify) but made him extremely restless so he was miserable in that sense. I‚Äôm doing alright. I take everything day by day. I stay up later than him so I can have time to myself to watch a show or work on a puzzle. Thank you for your comment :)
bipolar,ew5nk6n,t1_ew5lkhd,1565140582.0,He‚Äôs on medication and it doesn‚Äôt work all that well in my opinion. He may be having a mixed episode. It‚Äôs like something inside him is driving him to start arguments and be angry. He doesn‚Äôt seem to be aware that his behavior isn‚Äôt acceptable. He thinks it‚Äôs completely normal and that I‚Äôm irrational for not being accepting of his behavior.
Dermatology,evz0mhe,t1_evz0bke,1564946021.0,Oh ok and ugh I didn‚Äôt think it would take so long to heal :(
Dermatology,evyzk1r,t1_evyo3p5,1564945270.0,I ended up doing an online appointment through FaceTime with a doctor and got prescribed the exact cream you mentioned. I also have it bandaged. She said it‚Äôs a third degree burn. It is starting to hurt a little now and it looks worse instead of better but that‚Äôs probably because it‚Äôs been almost 48 hours since I got it. Everything I see online says 3rd degree burns require a skin graft. Mine is small and she didn‚Äôt mention getting one so I‚Äôm assuming it isn‚Äôt needed?
adhdwomen,evfrmlw,t3_cim20p,1564500237.0,My ADHD makes me an empath to a point that it can be exhausting and stressful but the upside is that I‚Äôm told I am great at lifting people up when they‚Äôre down. I think a lot of it is from the depression side of myself. I hate feeling depressed so when I see other people struggling I want to do anything I can to make them feel better and when I do it brings me a lot of joy myself. The other positive is that I‚Äôm great at making people feel accepted. Ever since I was little I would always approach the kid sitting alone and try to make friends with them.
adhdwomen,evfqvj3,t3_cjmhl1,1564499903.0,I watched a few episodes of her show and the one thing that stuck with me is the way she folds her clothes. I‚Äôve been doing it for 8ish months now because of watching her show. Now we have so much more room in all of our closets. I was able to put toys in my sons closet instead of just clothes. I also have an easier time parting with things because I ask myself if I really need or want the item. Our house looks much better since adapting her method.
rollercoasters,evfg80f,t1_eve8si0,1564495243.0,I think it would be awesome if they revamped Gemini to be like Steel Vengeance and still with racing trains but faster and with loops. It would be awesome if they made a train for top thrill that went backwards haha
rollercoasters,evffwuk,t1_evfd6u7,1564495092.0,I was stoned when I rode Steel Vengeance so it was A LOT for me to take in and I think I would have appreciated it more if I was sober lol. It felt too long and scary when I rode it but that‚Äôs the weed talking for sure because I know I would have loved it way more sober. I just hate the fast passes are so fucking expensive. We didn‚Äôt get them because it would have been $300 for my husband and I which is absurd. I wish they gave a discount of fast lane for military like they do for park entrance.

rollercoasters,evb61bx,t3_ciwcul,1564366897.0,I always thought living in Ohio sucked but Cedar Point makes our shitty winters not so bad when I know I can drive only a little over an hour to the biggest amusement park in the world in the summer.
cedarpoint,evb5mbn,t3_cicgmv,1564366532.0,Haha I was in line when that happened and was super pissed about how long it took them to put the train back into starting position. I was a couple feet from the turn dial and already had waited a good hour lol
cedarpoint,evb5c4n,t3_cioc13,1564366295.0,IMO it‚Äôs the worst roller coaster to exist. I rode it once years ago and never again because my head hit the bars back and forth like a pin ball so I had a migraine the rest of my time there.
