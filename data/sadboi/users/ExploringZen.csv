Three days later my body started not liking white rice. I've eaten white rice for decades, never an issue. To figure this out, I sat in meditation for a bit to find the cause. Turns out the two guys were talking about rice and how one guy liked all types of rice but not white rice. Somehow my mind picked that up as a ""program"".

If crying releases the underlying issue, then do it, fully. I mean ""ugly, box-full of tissues, sob-story"" cry it out. Because then it's out and your mind has the resources to move forward as needed.

Whether you're a guy or girl, you're human. Humans have emotions. Letting them out if healthy. Maybe not in the middle of meeting or driving a car, but at the end of each day, absolutely. Take 30 minutes. Go on, have fun experiencing the emotional side of humanity.

I used to have little confidence in myself until I realized confidence is irrelevant. It's not ""do I have the confidence"" to do something. It's ""I do"" something.

So best way to gain confidence quickly: purposefully fail at things... honestly... find something you know little about but want to learn. Get the equipment/items you need for it. Then tell yourself that the first three times you will fail. Then fail at it. Then look at the ""failures"" and see what could you do to make it better next time. Then purposefully ""half fail"" next time. Then 25% fail... then get it right.

Everyone fails/makes mistakes... but few learn from it.
