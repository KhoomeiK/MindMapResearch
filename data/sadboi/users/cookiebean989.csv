addiction,fqwxlja,t3_gle2ap,1589720624.0,"Im not sure of the severity of your use or what your endgame is when using it, but I can speak from personal experience if that helps. I also was in a similar situation for about a year and a half ago. I never had a dealer or anything and I felt that made me immune somehow from being considered to have a problem. But then I had a hard time fathoming going anywhere social at night without it. It gave me the confidence and ease i so badly wanted. For the first time I was not the first one to retreat back home during a night out. I stayed and socialized way longer than I used to. I loved the feeling. But then on a few occasions it would pop up at what should have been a low key happy hour and a Tuesday night now ended at 3am and I‚Äôd have work the next day. I decided I needed to stop. I distanced myself from my friends who would provide it or knew how to get it but that was hard. I lived in nyc so pretty much everyone I knew did it. I ended up moving away from the city for unrelated reasons and haven‚Äôt done it in a year and a half now. But it‚Äôs easier when the connection and temptation isn‚Äôt there. For you though it sounds like you are on the right path because there is a big will there and when there is a will there is a way. I don‚Äôt know too much about addiction so I can‚Äôt speak to that, but to me a once a week temptation doesn‚Äôt sound like it‚Äôs started to impact your job and relationships yet. It‚Äôs definitely a good time to stop. Disconnecting from that friend was a HUGE step in the right direction. KEEP IT UP"
relationship_advice,fqaacpe,t3_ghn2yd,1589215637.0,"A similar situation happened to me late last year. No warning signs before he just went silent. No ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù on Christmas Day even though I was supposed to spend the day with him and his family. But since I hadn‚Äôt heard from him in 2 dats before that, I wasn‚Äôt just going to show up at his sisters house. It was hell. A 34 year old nan should not act that way. Broke up with him that day. It SUCKED. Still does. But if he wanted to be that selfish and childish then I know I made the right choice. Also he did not congratulate me when I closed on my first home a month prior. Good riddance. 
Congratulations on graduating by the way! This is a tough spot but don‚Äôt blame yourself. Sounds like he‚Äôs acting immature and you don‚Äôt deserve that!!"
vegan,fotgqu7,t1_fotgm6o,1588053446.0,THANK YOU!!! I‚Äôm going to check these links out ASAP
vegan,fotbyxo,t1_fotbetq,1588049635.0,"Well said!! Ironically enough, my dad and his side of the family are farmers, too. Produce farmers! None of them are vegan but because their livelihood revolves around vegetables maybe they‚Äôll be more understanding? 
That‚Äôs awesome you got your grandma to join! 
My mom is currently on the keto diet which really consists of stuff that vegans CANT eat such as meats and cheeses. Her diet is now the exactly opposite from mine! 
I also did the 23andme generic test and found out I am more susceptible than others to gain weight if I eat too much saturated fat. My mom has that gene too but she chooses to ignore it. üôÑ
Sticking it out to convince them you‚Äôre serious sounds like the hardest part."
vegan,fot9qud,t1_fot9e5x,1588047997.0,"Loved this! I‚Äôm doing this for the animals and not necessarily the health benefits (although that‚Äôs a plus) so remaining strong in that conviction is my goal. 
Still nervous how it will be received and how it may impact my relationships but glad to see you have had similar concerns yet you have been vegan for so long. You‚Äôre a inspiration"

mentalhealth,fnrimvh,t3_g3cndu,1587190117.0,"You‚Äôll absolutely find someone! I don‚Äôt think the person you‚Äôre supposed to be with would consider your mental health history to be a dealbreaker. The people that love you care about your well-being and have empathy towards you. In all fairness, everyone has a past and everyone is imperfect. You shouldn‚Äôt anticipate needing to be perfect before you allow yourself to fall in love. 

I think the key, though, is to become equipped to know how to handle and manage your sadness so that when you are in a relationship you don‚Äôt inadvertently end up pushing that person away when you‚Äôre going through any low points.
I, also, had a suicide attempt that I thankfully survived. After that, I worked hard on learning how to deal with my depression alongside a therapist so I don‚Äôt end up isolating myself from my loved ones. 
My most recent ex, however, had his own slew of mental health issues including PTSD from serving in Iraq. He bottled it all up and would explode every six months or so. When those episodes happened, he‚Äôd practically ignore me for a few days and then come crawling back and apologize by saying he‚Äôd been feeling depressed and detached. I sympathized greatly because I‚Äôve been there before, but the way he treated his illness and how he coped with it drove us apart. 
I loved him and he loved me so it‚Äôs very sad. 

Long winded way of saying that I truly believe that your history will not have an impact on the person who is suited to you.

Best of luck. I hope you are taking care of your mental health during this difficult time. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

18 is about how old I was during my attempt and i often think back on how different things were back then. At 18 life has barely begun yet. The best, most exciting parts of life are right around the corner and you‚Äôre going to want to stick around for that. I promise üòä"
mentalhealth,fn9n9z2,t1_fn90izw,1586779170.0,"Thank you very much! I‚Äôm sorry to hear that you‚Äôve been going through a hard time! It does get better, I promise. The key is to start thinking about the future more than the past. Write down a wish-list for how you want your life to look next year, five years from now, etc. Focus on the positive things in your life to make those goals seem more obtainable and lean on the people in your life who love you for unconditional support. If you ever need to talk to someone anonymously, send me a message. I know I‚Äôm a stranger but I‚Äôm also a fairly decent person to confide in. ‚ù§Ô∏è

mentalhealth,fn9n02a,t1_fn9bjsn,1586778911.0,"Hi! OP here. I don‚Äôt have a ton of opinions about hospital I stayed at. It‚Äôs actually a fairly reputable hospital. I think it may be a teaching hospital as well. 

But when I stayed there, I was mostly so wrapped up in the awfulness of my circumstances to notice what the level of care was. I was there for about 4-5 days and a lot of that was spent sleeping. I do remember that I never earned the privilege to shower so that was a bit icky. 
A lot of people there were in very terrible situations that honestly gave me a new perspective on my own well-being. The woman I shared a room with had committed a violent act against her children and a kid down the hall that was about the same age as me also had a suicide attempt but while under the influence of heroine. I saw a lot of things in those 4-5 days that I hadn‚Äôt seen before. I think even just by being around others who were struggling helped me feel less alone somehow. 
The place seemed like a prison and that‚Äôs really my only complaint. 
When I was evaluated by doctors the day before I was released, they were very compassionate and understanding. I felt they were all there to help us. 
The 4-5 days were also like pressing pause on my life that felt out of control. I wouldn‚Äôt have thought this if I was there for much longer, but it did give me the space to reflect on things away from the environment that made me so sick. 

Care is there for a reason and if you ever feel like I did that night, please seek after help and don‚Äôt let any bad reputation stop you. The professionals there are trained to help."
