pansexual,fqourdw,t3_gjk4rm,1589525471.0,"Bi means two, but this doesn’t mean they only like females and males and that’s it, no it’s means a person who identifies with this label will usually like both sexes and then also like and have attraction to all/ a wide variety of expressions, types and genders. 
So they like two and then possibly more depending on the individual person as attraction differs from everyone (I’ve used a general explanation here as I am not bisexual myself and I’m sure someone who actually identifies with this sexuality could give you a better and more personal/ specific definition).  

Pan on the other hand means that everything is on the table for someone who identities with the label, they may sway a little towards being inclined with some people or have “types” over others but pretty much everything is still on the table, the saying hearts on parts is not favoured by most pans because it is mean and rude towards other sexualities making it seem like their attraction is not based around hearts which is wrong they care just as much about who they date as any pansexual, but on that note pansexuals are not going to consider someone’s identity or gender or sex or expression as a “turn off” ever, personality and appearance is the factors that are most important (this is where there are very clear similarities with bisexual because they too for the most part also consider personality and appearance as main factors that are focused on."

pansexual,fqgm5x0,t3_gh4elc,1589350074.0,"Hey so it’s totally up to you how you label yourself, but bisexual does still include liking 2 genders or more so it could still be a possible candidate for a label that may feel comfortable to you, I found that before I came to the conclusion that pansexual suited me the most I looked into all possible communities/ sexualities to find the right label, so doing some exploring and playing around and interactions with different labels is always a good way to go, and sexuality is fluid so the label/s that you use may change and be just as fluid."
