selfie,fq8pp6m,t3_gh4xtv,1589172104.0,To be honest I never pay attention to the pictures because I'm more interested in a woman's personality and I don't message girls who aren't asking to be talked to but I do acknowledge that you are beautiful.
selfie,fn16hzj,t3_fyaojp,1586555758.0,Eh a lot of us have jewish ancestors. I'm irish German french polish Jewish and indian asian. Just human.
selfie,flu7joo,t3_fr0sfm,1585496923.0,Naw baby girl you're beautiful. Besides18 isn't all that. I don't want anything to do with an 18 year old.
selfie,fkpk12g,t3_fjloyc,1584411998.0,Definitely totally cute. Peace Love and Kindness to you. Namaste.
LittlespacePersonals,fkc0jfk,t1_fkbuy60,1584043429.0,This post is so old. Hey how are you doing. Ah and I'm about to be 35.
BPD,fgkf7fq,t3_eyunl7,1580864148.0,Yeah I wake up and wonder which bastard am I my today? Should I even try to be social of just be quite. Fake it till you make it doesn't work when you're shitty at faking it. Today has been one of those days. It's the end of the day and I just wanna talk to my baby girl and word vomit and listen to her be her baby girl self. Small joys on a day where I just don't feel like myself.
selfie,fg4p053,t3_ewr62z,1580507914.0,Yeah beautiful.
BPD,ffjpwps,t1_ffjmowg,1580003965.0,And I'm antisocial to. Lol I don't like to be alone but I don't like people. How does that make sense? Lol
BPD,ffjpo4h,t1_ffjmowg,1580003811.0,I've been watching YouTube videos a lot. And yeah your right that helps. I got my dog but he's just not the same as hearing people. I got one little and shes a good girl. She understands. But she's in Florida and I'm in Illinois. It's more a friend thing. I'm sure I'll be fine. I was fine before my roommate moved in. The big issue is I haven't had a car for 3 months and haven't been able to leave the house. I should have a car in a few days but it's stressing me out having to talk to all there people and saying I've only got $400 and I won't have it till Tuesday. I can't even get to work and I need to get to a psychiatrist for a psych eval. I just ain't doing well. I hold it together most of the time. Especially when someone can see but when I'm alone it all and myself it's all there with me. Like the people in the room I can feel them breathing on the back of my neck. Figuratively speaking... YouTube videos. Friends when I can talk to someone. And patience. Remembering to breath.
BPD,ff3adcc,t3_erb9pz,1579537339.0,Actually I know I have BPD and relationships focused OCD and I haven't seen anyone about it and I can tell you it couldn't be worse. I'll get meds after the diagnosis and that will definitely be better. I drove a new girl in 3 days last week. Can't get worse. I ruin my relationships and I've had some of the best women.
DDLGconfess,fezgd22,t1_fezg6th,1579457055.0,No problem. Your one is out there.
DDLGconfess,fezg4kb,t1_fez890v,1579456970.0,Okay yeah. She was definitely not right for you. Obviously she'd been planning it.
DDLGconfess,fez859i,t1_fez5qii,1579454691.0,You know I do all kinds of things for littles and never think I'm getting anything. To be honest my reward is simply giving to them. Their job is my reward. I don't think I'm explaining it well but I don't want a card or anything. I'd rather get an I wove you Daddy or a hug. Hmmm for me giving is my reward. Being allowed to be her caregiver is my great joy and reward.
BPD,fez4we1,t3_eqrdtd,1579453890.0,I stopped looking for a relationship until I get my BPD under control... It's sad but I'm much more stable and normal alone.
BPD,fen77mr,t3_epxg7k,1579278486.0,Omg. I thought I was just... I do this to. Well I definitely need to get my psych eval now. I didn't realize this was a symptom.
BPD,fekni9w,t1_fekm114,1579203731.0,Hears what I do. I take everything out of the sink and stack them on the table. Be careful. I've had times I got a spike and just threw a stack of dishes on the floor... Make the dish water and do dishes a bit at a time. It helps that I'm not looking at them all and my OCD doesn't make me flip out this way or trust me I wouldn't have pots and pans. I want after a pan once with a hammer because... Don't remember. Hmm I was pissed.
BPD,fekijhj,t3_epnk5q,1579200771.0,Yeah I used to be pretty active and felt better. But I'm pretty much where you are... I'm trying. Sometimes you just gotta move a bit at a time and see what you can do. But yeah those days washing a dish feels impossible.
BPD,fekhu4e,t1_fekhcw2,1579200350.0,I had my primary physician put me on some medication for anxiety and mood swings for a month but when I went to refill the prescription the insurance company said that I had to try something else cuz they wouldn't pay for it  what he switched me to made me feel tired 24/7 so I refused to take it because I was falling asleep at work. I'm not looking forward to being a guinea pig. I just need meds that work in a diagnosis.
r4r,fdsbzml,t3_emw4t7,1578699122.0,Proud of you! Keep up the good work. Achieve those goals and ambitions.
BDSMpersonals,fdd0fbb,t3_eknspm,1578289911.0,Central Illinois. 34 Dom. If you'd like to talk we can arrange something.
BDSMpersonals,fd9pd8f,t3_ekaaa7,1578236327.0,I'm not sure about the online part but I am a Daddy Dom and I'd be willing to chat and see how things go and I would never ghost someone. That's so disrespectful.
