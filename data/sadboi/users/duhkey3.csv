AskReddit,fqv6mo0,t1_fqv3kju,1589670924.0,Thanks. I take it for my suicidal ideations. My psychiatrist is trying to taper me off and insists that I get bloodwork done every three months. It certainly is not an ideal medication due to the side-effects.
AskReddit,fqv2u56,t1_fqtudxf,1589668753.0,"I also have essential tremors in my hands, so I have always been very shaky. Now I take a lot of lithium, so it is even worse. I hate it when people ask, ""Am I making you nervous?"" Sometimes I preemptively tell them that I have shaky hands even though it's none of their business."
AskReddit,fqv1v3r,t3_gkwoe8,1589668202.0,How are you?
SuicideWatch,fbft6yp,t3_ectk8j,1576820175.0,"I have been suicidal during this time of year for much of my adult life. These last 4 years have been the hardest. I don't have any money to spend on frivolous things. Right now I have $3.45 in my bank account until I get paid next week. I don't have any family in town. I had a friend but she has ghosted me since February for some reason. I had a receiving manager job at a bookstore for 12 years until I was laid off in February 2018. I was making enough money to pay my bills and a little extra. Now I have a job that pays half of what I was getting before. So I'm also possibly losing my home to the bank. It's in forclosure. I don't know where I will live after that happens. So yeah, I am super depressed. I'm thinking about killing myself on my birthday in January. My therapist, who is not charging me, is trying to change my mind. Killing myself right now feels like I'm throwing her generosity in her face. I am grateful for her though."
SuicideWatch,f8s4mw7,t1_f8rm8kc,1574768975.0,I'm sure you are correct. I have not tried Ketamine infusion nor any other new treatment. Ty for reading my post and for the reply.
SuicideWatch,f2z832k,t3_derh4d,1570509629.0,"I live in Florida so I don't know what things are like there. Here, it is best if you voluntarily admit yourself. Even if you don't go voluntarily it is only 72 hours that they keep you unless you are still at risk of harming yourself or others. I have been admitted like 8 times  voluntarily at my therapist's suggestion or urging. Once I was Baker Acted in Florida. This is what they call involuntarily here. Once it happened in Houston. 

Anyway, it is not scary. It might feel scary because you can't just leave. I look at it as an expensive baby sitter for me where they may adjust my meds. I actually enjoy being locked up because for a short time all I have to do is sleep, eat, and go to therapy. I don't worry about all the stuff that got me feeling suicidal. There are no responsibilities when you're there.

I don't know what to tell you about your parents. Looks like they don't want to lose control or maybe they want to save face. You know maybe they fear they will be humiliated? Some people worry about crap like that. As far as should you even go... Usually someone will ask if you have a plan. If you say yes, then you need to be admitted. Ways to get admitted are to go there on your own and tell the check in person in the ER that you are feeling suicidal. Another way is to ask your school counselor or a trusted teacher to get you help. You might want to explain the parental issue. Or, just call 911 yourself. That would invoke a lot of fear and anxiety for me though.

Good luck."
SuicideWatch,f2z5xfy,t3_det5an,1570507516.0,"I think my sister would be very sad if I died. Like many have said, she is the reason I am still alive. Also I don't want to abandon my dogs and I don't want to cause my therapist any problems. My only solution is to hope that I die by accident. Maybe murdered or struck by lightning. The people I love would still be sad but without the legacy that suicide leaves behind."
SuicideWatch,f26108h,t1_ezsmeb4,1569989535.0,"No time for counseling? What about a mental break from this person? I'm reminded of the instructions that are given when I fly. ""... First put on your oxygen mask before you try to help others."" We are unable to help others until we help ourselves first."
googleplaymusic,f0ixah7,t1_f0i0i7l,1568648216.0,"I might still buy it. It is very cool! Although, I think a customer service woman from Google told me that our playlists would be moved over to YouTube Music. I'm still not sure about it though. I might be depressed for a few days if I lost my playlists. I've taken screen shots of a few of them. Just in case."
googleplaymusic,f0gzgqw,t1_ezubvs7,1568609556.0,Almost but you have to pay for it. Bummer.
MindHunter,exxfhu6,t1_exk8wqb,1566635125.0,Yes! That f#¬¢ker is the only serial killer that has scared the sh1t out of me! They called him the Toy Box killer. I'm so glad he is dead.
MindHunter,exxb8k7,t3_cu3iyx,1566633209.0,Nope
MindHunter,exxb542,t3_cu6gsc,1566633176.0,His father burned a bunch of stuff for Wayne.
MindHunter,exxa8zs,t1_exx688q,1566632792.0,No he has always maintained his innocence.
MindHunter,exxa2mu,t3_cu17ej,1566632720.0,I heard it was partially due to the Atlanta Monster podcast.
MindHunter,exx9ou3,t1_exs4pfw,1566632544.0,"It's interesting too because the real FBI dude said that he did not think it was about sex for Wayne, but rather control. Wanting to be important."
MindHunter,exx8spq,t1_exsa3k4,1566632159.0,He gives several jail interviews.
MindHunter,exx8onz,t3_cu4spj,1566632107.0,"I think his dad was involved somehow, besides just burning shit for Wayne."
MindHunter,exx8g58,t3_cup1a9,1566632005.0,I enjoyed seeing things the way they looked when I was a kid. That is one of the reasons I love this show.
depression,expf33d,t1_eqcpdks,1566489710.0,"Sorry for the late reply. I am happier in general. I don't know how much of it is due to my antidepressants, dbt, getting older, or something else. I DO think that the dbt therapy is worth it. It has taken some time and a lot of practice to use my wisemind and the skills that I am being taught."

depression,eqype6c,t3_bzpfvt,1560387203.0,I often wish I could get a hug but not from just anyone. It is best from someone who really knows me. I don't have any memories of my mom and dad hugging me when I was a kid so I wonder if that is why hugs from most people make me feel uncomfortable. I go to Narcotics Anonymous meetings and there's always several people there who love to hug. If you are in desperate need you could get a hug there. üòè
depression,eqqm09x,t1_eqmbkb7,1560224619.0,"Thanks for sharing this article. It mentioned how much bureaucracy homeless people have to navigate, especially if they want help. Only recently have I been able to understand that because since I was laid off last year I have not been able to find a job that pays even half of what I was getting. I'm glad I found a job though. 

Anyway, Just figuring out Food Stamps and if I qualify for any other assistance has been a nightmare. I can't imagine how much more I would have to try to navigate if I was homeless. Also, having a computer was almost a necessity. I am thankful for the help but it wasn't easy to get, especially with depression and social anxiety holding me back."
depression,eqboz4f,t1_eqbni1r,1559952522.0,I've been in DBT for exactly 3 years. It has reduced my impulse to take my own life but in general I still do not have a life worth living in my opinion. Suicidal thoughts used to be almost a daily thought. Now it is about 3 times a week. I have stopped self-injury though.
depression,eqblohl,t3_bxxdwb,1559951030.0,"This is also the thought in my head most of the time. I've even thought about crazy ideas like walking around in dangerous places where I could get shot or hiring someone to kill me. I don't think any of my ideas would end like I want. With my luck I'd be mamed, raped or tortured and not dead."
depression,epuzq8s,t1_epszrr1,1559520426.0,Super impressed with volunteering. It's supposed to be a great way to get out of your head.
depression,epuzgze,t3_bvup45,1559520221.0,That's depression. I imagine many of us here feel the same thing.
