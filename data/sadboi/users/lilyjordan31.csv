OCD,etrpjea,t1_etronqa,1563126310.0,"i don’t personally think my circumstance is OCD, my coworker that has it just saw what i did and was so adamant about that being a sign so it freaked me out. i appreciate the advice, i’m definitely gonna ask my psychiatrist about it next time i can."
BPD,esiq50w,t3_c80ebh,1562018155.0,"i haven’t actually personally experienced it but a close friend of mine does it regularly and she said she was 1 out of 17 patients of her doctors that it worked on. it apparently has a low chance of working on some people but for her specifically, she loves it so much and it’s helped tremendously. i don’t want you to waste money on it but i definitely think it’s worth a try because i’ve seen a lot of change in her."
