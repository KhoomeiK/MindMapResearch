EatingDisorders,fqgod77,t3_g59ymb,1589351957.0,"At first I'm like, I'm a go on a diet and it didn't work so I'm like I honestly don't care about my health at this point I'ma just starve, and idk how I found out eating disorders existed I think at that point I thought people starve, it's called fasting... A diet, fasting is a diet not a disorder... People eat low calories to loose weight and that is a flipping diet... Chill out it will only be temporary.... 2 years later, nope not temporary... And I don't want to recover, my parents haven't found out sooooooo... Let's just keep going I'll quit at sone point, a year later, I'm not in the mood to quit, 3 seconds later, yeah I have a disorder... ._. I kinda went into it with self doubt I said it wasn't a disorder because I was gonna only restrict a little and I thought why would I restrict a little when I can restrict a lot, so I knew I had a disorder it was just like and idc thing, but I do care now because it sucks and I hate it but I'm not gonna stop because, idk I don't want to idk why I don't want to because I hate every second of it but I dont. Like that self doubt went away the second I realized normal people don't stop eating for a couple of days and weigh everyday and check the calories on everything and are absolutely obsessed with being skinny and really don't care that the effects will last forever blah blah blah ed stuff... Sooooo....... Yeah"
