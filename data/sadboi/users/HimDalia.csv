relationship_advice,fi6hvfo,t3_f6jqqz,1582195636.0,At age 20 you want to move in together and expect silly young girl to not spend money she earns for what she wants. Honestly it's too early. She clearly is too young to take responsibility for home and expenses which comes with ir. Most girls go through crazy shopping phase and after a while realize (or not which is worst case scenario) that they need to stop or calm down with it. Age 20 is bad idea to start live together is such responsible matter which is own apartment/ home. I doubt you can convince her to not spend money on what she wants. Rather wait with moving on together and let her understand it's not the way in life

Dentistry,fei3n00,t3_ep9p3k,1579129553.0,"This sounds so bad and wrong. I don't know what country you are from but i will tell you how it was with me. My teeth always were awful (thank you father for nice genes) and when i was 17y old was my last dentist visit when 3 women tried to remove 1 tooth for 30min. I never went back to dentist after that.

But last year i started to have so terrible teethache i wasnt able to kill it with painkillers anymore. That's was awful..i needed to go to dentist if i wanted it or not. 

I was also ashamed cuz i was aware i probablyt have tons to do. But team was really proffesional, nurses as well very nice and informative. It's germany, so basicly i didnt need to pay for anything, because insurance covers all. So i guess could say it's like public dentist?

And yeah, i needed to have removed 2 teeth surgicaly, 1 canal, 3 other one removes, 2 fillings. Everyhting was proffesional, no pain, and if there was i was getting one more injection into gum to numb it more (well years of taking painkillers did a job here )

Also no one ever told me to go to hygienist ? First time i hear about it. After all my teeth was done, at last visit nurse cleaned my whole teeth from i asume was a stone ? Not quite sure if that's word for that. So my teeth were smooth and like not so fat? I could fill them all separatly with my toungue xd 

&#x200B;

Root canal oof that's ...terrible thing some says. But if it's done properly it doesn't hurt or anything. It's just really long process and you sit there and you just die on this chair hearing all those toosl (but don't feel any pain or anything) so i guess only your butt hurts .

Root canal is when they need to root basicly with needle into canals inside your tooth to clean infection which is inside and to save your tooth. You can have 3-4-2 any amount of canals in tooth, That's quite random. So after they clean canals, they will close it with special paste, use some funny laser thing and either straight away put filling on tooth or put some medicine and next visit change it into filling. My root canal took like 1hour 30min.

But what i suggest...find other dentist. Dentists are scary and to feel comfortable you should get actually proffesional dentist which knows what he is doing and what you wrote...i wouldn't let them touch any of my teeth. 

Sorry for long answer, hope you read at least part and will give you some informations. Goodluck!"

Not quite happy about your sleeping part but i do understand that and i don't blame you. You slept with one person she....can't even count anymore. Every single sentence says she slept with this or this or this guy.

Just save yourself time. It's not worth. people like that don't change and i know from experience how my father was. Even 2 kids didn't stop him.

Also there is this thing that some girls are falling for guys which ignores them. Just yeah go with only actual friend relations and it can give you 2 results : either she will understand where her place is or she will understand what she is missing and will want to be with you. Either way you SHOULDN'T give her what she wants because it only hurts you, not her and it's just not worth it. 

Also cuddling naked? That's not how best friends work. Not even siblings. And you know it's not right.

Other idea is to try and make routine. Fill water twice a day, let's say mornings and evenings.

Cats don't drink as much water as human, so they don't need so plenty of it. I mean they do need it but they prefer a nice meat with sauce over it. And don't refil it if she spills it. Maybe after time he will learn and understand there is no water for him. Or you can refil at morning, give him 30min, if he won't drink it just take it away, and repeat the process at evening.

So i found job in UK, through polish agency in care home. You can say you took care of someone from family grandpa grandma, doesn't matter and don't need to have any experience or it doesn't even need to be true as they provide training in care home anyway. In my situation perfect english won it ( cuz as well of games etc in early years of my life) and I got the job.

And i finally started living. They provided room in house for staff working in care home. Had stable payment. Didn't need to worry and care about anything. 

And i was finally free, No one to tells me what to do, no one to abuse me and keep telling me how sh\*t I am.

As for me this half year would be enough to knew you care about me and you are a guy i want to be with.

But she...i don't know maybe she is also frustrated she can't just drop veganism and would love to eat meat again?

I guess try to calmly talk to her what she is actually mad at. Tell her you supported her for a half year So she didn't need to start this veganism all alone.

If she won't talk, keep screaming etc iwould suggest moving out. Not talking for a while. To let her be on her own and think about all this. And then if she still don't care, is abusive towards your diet decission...you know the answer.

While sitting at dentist chair i felt like i will get heartattack. I was shaking and breathing so heavily. But once they finished i felt relieve. It didn't hurt and everything went well. During next couple of months i got all my teeth done (2 wisdom  teeth removed which was terrible afterwards but that's different story + 2 other removed surgicly) And now im fully healed and pain free ! 

( but i still don't really like denstists :D )

So keep it up, all will be fine !"
relationship_advice,f6dd7am,t3_dqvcm1,1572793345.0,"Well obviously everyone here will advice you to leave, because he cheated, that's no discussion, he was buying gifts for her etc. But if it's too hard for you and you woul want to try one last thing. Tell him: show me what you do with her. Show me everything. And then you can decide if it's sth idk let's call it ""not normal"" or if it's just small type of kinks. Cuz maybe when you will find out that actually what he does with other woman is disgusting and you won't even be able to look at him after what he will tell you. I guess it will make decission what to do easier"

CatAdvice,f5h75gy,t3_dnr3oh,1572201407.0,"To be honest i had same issue with my cat. I found her on abandoned farm as a kitten and adopted. At begin she didn't meow that much but after ike 4months she started to literally keep screaming at me, at doors at window. So what i started to do is to go out with her for a walks with a leash. She loved it. She was catching bugs and just lvoed being outside. But then cuz of my work i needed to spend most of the day out. Was going back home only evenings and was too tired to actually go out with her. Also her meowing didn't stop cuz of walks. It actually got worst. But after this 1 and a half week of me being most of the day out of home she stopped meowing. She completly forgot sth like outside exists. She does sometimes meow but for attention so i just play with her a while and she is fine. Got her also interactive toys so she can be on herself too. And that's h9ow i cured my cat."
