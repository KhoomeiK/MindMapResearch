- Watch BSJ videos and adopt his advice, and only focus on one role and master 2 to 3 heroes max.

He has videos coaching all sort of ranks and all sort of different roles. I think I have never got help from videos as much as I got from BSJ.

stephenking,fnibkj4,t3_g1p439,1586977225.0,One of my favorite books. If not THE favorite. I read it a while back when the COVID19 was just hitting the news but not the country I'm living in. Needless to say it kept me anxious and I couldn't put it down. I'd highly recommend the audio version from Audible.
learndota2,fnh6jom,t3_g1ngwh,1586956072.0,"I hope your read this even if it's a bit long. But these are really what helped me. 

1- I'm not saying this to make ypu feel slightly better. But don't underestimate how hugely people are better at Dota. So the skill level even for lower brackets have improved.

2- someone pointed this out. But this has helped me a LOT. Watch BSJ videos and work on what weaknesses resonate with yours.

3- I've been in the same situation as you but what I've noticed even if it was only a 500 mmr plus from where I was is that I kept spamming WD as a support, and I did my part of supporting. Of course it's not about WD nor the many hours I've put in, but rather that now I literally can feel the hero. I know how to last hit. I know his hit range. I know when and how to use my skills. I know what fights I can take and what fights I must run away from. I know where to stand and place my Maledict and Death Ward.
Point is... when you master a hero, you improve ten folds. But when playing a different hero every single game with a different role every couple of games, you'll stay where you are no matter how much you play. It's about practice and consistency with what you know. 

4- make some friends. When you play support for example, add that carry who you had a chemistry with and play more games together. Makes a shit load of difference. For the past 2 weeks. I've been playing only with a friend I met on Dota and my experience has been far better because I'm no longer facing that many tilted games with ragers and all that and it improved the moral of the team when we are dominating our lane. 

These are only a fraction of what you need to improve, but when you start, you'll find yourself wanting to improve even more. That's how the dopamine of Dota 2 works.

Happy Dota 2 games."

For the sake of example. Some people love watching Hell's Kitchen. Because they love seeing how Ramzi shits all over the chefs who are more than happy to be shouted at by their idol. And while they love to see the Drama they also love to see the ordinary people who are basically like them and from the same social background so they can fantasize being in their situation. 

As for your specific Kardashian show, I think it's purely a matter of watching the made up rich family drama. Because its 80% made up and exaggerated like any other reality TV show, they love to see how A dealt with B after she knew she called her a slut behind her back and how she trash talks in front of the Camera when she ""loses it"", and how oh they might bring someone from the ordinary people - again there is a pattern here - and see how they lose it when big butt hugs them etc, etc, etc."

""When this happens for a short period of time, it's called excitement and sometimes when we are nervous we throw up. But when this  happens for a long time continuously and there is no physical problem. It basically means that your body is rejecting this person so bad that you throw up even if you think that you ""love this person"".""
