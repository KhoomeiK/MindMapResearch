mentalhealth,fpf2tdj,t1_fpepvnk,1588560462.0,There was a point in my life where I spent the majority of a year in bed from depression and/or bi-polar so I can relate. Even now I have to consume 500mg+ of caffeine just to start a task some days. I‚Äôd recommend starting with one small goal everyday even if it‚Äôs something simple like ‚Äòre-arrange your room‚Äô or ‚Äòread a chapter of a certain book‚Äô. Eventually you‚Äôll be able to take on bigger daily goals like ‚Äògo grocery shopping‚Äô or ‚Äòexercise‚Äô. Your brain will physically reward you with endorphins for accomplishing these goals. I did something similar and now I own a thriving company even with the lingering problems. I‚Äôm not saying you will own your own company if you do this but you will see progression if you stick with it.
mentalhealth,fpf1hjx,t1_fpe65hr,1588559605.0,I washed my hands hundreds of times a day sometimes. You can‚Äôt stop because your mind is the one forcing you to do it. I take 40mg Paxil everyday to help with OCD. (I just have to say that I can‚Äôt recommend any medication to you because I‚Äôm not a doctor)

mentalhealth,fpdx3jp,t3_gcwhq7,1588535978.0,I had severe OCD where I would spend hours in the bathroom doing rituals. My advice to you is to first go get some fresh air and god for a long walk to organize your thoughts. Next maybe go see a physiatrist and tell them all symptoms. Getting on the right medication saved my life I believe.
mentalhealth,fpdwp2r,t3_gcwjsu,1588535749.0,"It‚Äôll probably never go away, but there are some things to help get you to tomorrow.

For depression: stay busy. Doesn‚Äôt matter what it is just fill up you time with something 

For anxiety: stay distracted. Whether it‚Äôs a good tv show, video games, exercise. Just keep your mind distracted with something 

Meds: finding the right meds can be a lifesaver literally. I take Paxil, Hydroxyzine & Adderol ... I think I would‚Äôve committed suicide from anxiety/OCD if it were not for paxil. Find a good psychiatrist/doctor and listen to them

Find purpose: whether you‚Äôre religious or not I‚Äôd recommend reading the New Testimate . You might be surprised as to what answers you find

Hope this helps a little"
