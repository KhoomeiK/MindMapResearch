I always thought the classic hypomanic sypmtoms were just me not being normal and that I needed to control myself better.

 Which is true, but one of the things that made me realize the medicine was working was that the symptoms that I always thought were character flaws went from obsessions to something I could control a lot better. 

It's not that the urges still aren't there, but they aren't the only thing I can think about. Whether it is buying things, my sex drive, needing to max out on whatever I'm doing."

My primary care doctor prescribed them to me before I saw my psychiatrist, I felt better and less depressed, but I began to worry that I was actually schizophrenic because I couldn't differentiate all my thoughts and perspectives.

relationship_advice,f31d4o8,t3_df6ks6,1570572723.0,"Hey u/Conswaygo,

First I totally feel you on this man, as a man I definitely get the need and desire as well, and you writing about your feelings of being undesired or wanted really kind of hit home. I was also in a similar situation. I definitely felt super depressed by this time and time again. I even gained a lot of weight from it (imagine Fat Bastard - I'm fat because I'm sad...and sad because I'm far ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£)

I think something I forget sometimes is that my mood isn't always my partners mood, as well as my needs aren't always my partners needs. In this sense it sounds like she needs a lot more emotional support than she needs the physical/sexual one. 

As you are mentioning it sounds like it's been difficult for you to tend to her emotional needs, when your physical needs aren't met and vice versa.

It sounds like you guys are living are really busy lifestyle. I totally get that. It also means you both must be dealing with a lot of stress. (Stress is change and other things it can be good and bad) The need to fulfill that sexual need can definitely add to the pressure and tension as well for both of you.
If she is saying that sex is very low on her priority list, maybe see what else is on that list, and see if there is any way to knock those out. Then you will be free-er to knock some boots. If she and you are less stressed, she may be a little more ""In the mood""

And worse case, you can throw down the no excuse card (imagine if you will ""Exodia!!!"" I loled a little to hard at this)

(One more thing - Uncle Chan) 
I think something that people also forget sometimes is having girlfriend doesn't mean you get a free unlimited/easy sex card. In the sense that, imagine if you were single again. How much effort and time does it take for you to get someone comfortable to have sex with you? (Maybe you are Chris Hemsworth and it is really easy for you, and I'm way off base here) for me it takes a while of getting to know somewhere before even I'm comfortable. 

Maybe convert that same energy in your suggestion to be platonic, to trying to ""pick up"" your own girlfriend. It may sound counterintuitive since she's already your girlfriend, but it may make both of you feel kinda sexier. 

If all your needs are met and she still doesn't want to get intimate then you guys may need to have a larger conversation, about what it will take to get intimate. Or what's going on in your relationship and lives. 

Good luck gettin' busy. 

P.S props on 4* a month bro."

LifeProTips,f2nykqq,t3_ddvebh,1570321048.0,"For beginners advice.
For me it was discovering automation. 

Just automatically set your account to put away something you can afford each month, even if it's just $1.

Be sure to be realistic and be sure to stick to it. #CONSISTENCY 

If you aren't responsible with yourself, be honest with yourself and automatically move it to somewhere that is kinda hard for you to reach so you aren't tempted to take from it. 

If you're just starting try doing a credit union that's a little to out of your way to get to, or a savings account somewhere you don't have access and you can automatically put away like a set $ amount each month.

Pro Level:
Do some automated funds, stocks, ETFs, etc or look into things that will give you better returns than savings rates. (Don't sweat this now if you're just starting) the key is to start. 

If you're working and your job offers retirement accounts those are great vehicles to automatically save. 

401(k) programs max out at $19,000/year. Don't feel overwhelmed by a number, just contribute as much as you can and you are comfortable. It's okay if you can only do a little in the beginning. 

Just make sure to stay consistent, even if it's just $1 stay consistent and be diligent.

As for moving out. Make sure you have at least a basic  plan. You don't need to think of all the little things, but at least have a plan (remember you need to be able to have basic furniture - no need to buy if you have it or can get some from friends who want to throw things away - and be able to feed yourself) and if you want to be REALLY prepared, make sure to have 6 months of emergency savings. (I had a friend move out and he lived in a studio, slept on a floormat with a sleeping bag, and had his computer and a TV on top of a box..that's it for over a year - nothing wrong with that if you're happy with that) 

Emergency savings means having enough to pay rent and at least be able to eat ramen for 6 months if you were to lose your job. Having this can also protect you from life's pitfalls. Like injury, emergencies and accidents etc. You never want to have it, but you want to at least be prepared. 

The above is from me learning from many .....many .....many.....mistakes and failures. Over...and over ...and.......over again. Sad to say I'm even in the finance industry. ðŸ˜… 

So the plans above are outlines/guidelines. 
 Don't sweat the small stuff, life isn't perfect, people aren't perfect, nothing really happens how we want it to. But we can just try to have a plan and stick to it as close as we can. 

Good luck out there."
offmychest,f2l3ef9,t3_ddoucl,1570291495.0,"I am sorry you are going through this. 

I think a lot of us have been there, comparing ourselves to anyone else is hard, especially if they are as close as a sibling who we may feel share our genetics and our backgrounds. 

But know that the person he is, isn't the perception that you have. His image today came from somewhere. I'm sure he has had his own struggles and his own hardships to get to where he is. 

I've known people who have felt the way you feel about him, about me. Someone who's successful good at so many things and etc. But in reality most of the time I feel like you. Why am I not good enough? Why is everyone else so much better? Why can't I speak well? Why can't I understand people? Why no matter how hard I try I still fail? Am I really just disabled and everyone is just being kind to me? 

My father use to tell me, ""you are nothing, son. In this world there will always be someone better, faster, stronger, smarter than you."" 
I use to feel so sad and hurt, by this. I always felt compared and less than everyone else. I always felt he thought I was worthless. 

But one day, I realized there was a second part of his quote that I never really listened to. ""If not today, someday you will be surpassed. So we can only do our best today, and work as hard as we can to be the best that we can now."" 

No one can be perfect. I struggle with this every day. I realized my desire to be ""perfect"" is an arrogant quest. It means that you are saying that anyone who isn't is ""less than"" and not worthy. 

When in actuality we are all just trying our best, even if it doesn't feel that way sometimes. That includes your brother, it includes your parents, and it includes your friends around you. 

A worthy failure is greater than a mediocre success. 

You are worthy of failure, don't be afraid of it. You are worthy of success, you are worthy love, and being loved. You are worthy of today, and you are worthy of tomorrow. 

I wish you good luck. I hope you find peace in what you're looking for.

Sorry for the long post. Selfishly, I wanted to write all my feelings ðŸ˜­"

Fast forward about 8 years, and he reached out to me out of the blue, and just apologized for missing these passed few years. At first I felt sad for the time we lost, but I honestly was really happy to hear from him. 

We met up and it was like time hadn't passed. I don't know if your friend will be the same, but I didn't want to ask him about it unless he wanted to talk about it, out of respect for him. So I just focused on the happy times we had together.

DecidingToBeBetter,f2jwgkm,t3_ddmgib,1570278428.0,"Lately my first inclination for my myself has been to say love yourself first. It's one of the hardest things to do. 

Starting with spending time with yourself, like really spend time with yourself, not just watching TV, eating, or just being alone, or do something to distract yourself. I mean sit and ask yourself questions and take notes of your likes and dislikes. Being introspective is becoming harder and harder, as we have so many other things that we can consume and distract ourselves with.

It isn't am easy process, but I think if you can get to know and find things you love about yourself, then the other things will come. 

Also remember you are worthy of being loved, regardless of how bland you might feel your personality is.

I find it hard communicating a lot of my feelings to people in ""the real world""/non-Reddit world. Reading others' experiences gave me some solace that I'm not the only one that feels this way. 
 
Logically I know I could ask for help from friends and family, but emotionally it is so difficult for me to muster the courage to share this side of me. 

 I think people see me very differently. In the job that I have, the friendships and people I know. I feel like it's difficult for me to share or even communicate a lot of these feelings that I have, because I feel like I need to have it all together for my family, clients, friends, students, and even mentors who believe in me and rely on me.

 vs. Someone who has a daily struggle to even get out of bed or even want to open his eyes some days. Or someone who hyperventilates in the morning so he gets it out of the way and going in to what feels like a high pressure job.
