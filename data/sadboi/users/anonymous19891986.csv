ptsd,fgre1jh,t1_fgpm4iu,1581044524.0,Yeah I'm just curious if this is normal. It doesn't seem normal to me since in my exp most people do not change. My guess is it would take an extreme experience. I wasn't sure if the trauma lead to building up pressure causing mayhem in her life and the random bro visit just made that pressure erupt causing that extreme change. It's just interesting how someone can change so drastically since I'm quite inexperienced with ptsd and mental health in general
ptsd,fgrdnut,t1_fgpq5zq,1581044262.0,"Sorry, reading it now it doesn't seem clear. I meant to ask if changing your behavior completely is something that happens during recovery. I guess before she was diagnosed with c/ptsd she was a wild person but then the trigger happened causing her to be hospitalized and ultimately seeking pro mental help. This trigger would eventually lead her to dropping her bad habits? It's strange to me because I've always been a certain way but a 180 change isn't conceivable to me unless maybe something really bad happened. And yeah she's reaching her mid 30s

Edit: not sure if I'm so much concerned but curious as to how a person can change so much."
ptsd,fgrdbyh,t1_fgqk9dc,1581044033.0,"Interesting, I don't know the whole story but it's alien to me. Like her and her bro got along 5 years after the abuse. But his aggressive behavior towards her exes and his random visit probably made her defenses go down and then the random visit was the unprepared thing you mentioned which sent her over the edge"
starbuckspartners,ff5dmhn,t1_ff0i4i9,1579588473.0,Someone in the comments has the answer :)
starbuckspartners,ff1byxh,t1_ff0v5iy,1579477319.0,Thank you!
GirlsxBattle2,fd8d52o,t1_fd856zx,1578217104.0,Check out the Discord. Patrol is one of the most important things in the game if you want to progress. To answer your question: Muppet is t4/t1.5 pvp/pve in the far future when enj drops to t1 from t0 (edit: pvp wise). This information is true if gxb2 decides to follow ih's path as it mostly has (gxb2 is basically ih reskinned).
ptsd,fbe4xhz,t1_fbd60ti,1576778275.0,"That's interesting! She's always happy to see me when i spontaneously show up to her house. Would it be okay if that continues? At the time, I tried to keep it to once a week or every other week to not overload her."
ptsd,fbd1351,t1_fbczgrh,1576741688.0,"Thank you for response. I'm trying to believe this. Normally, these are signs that she's just not into me or something bad. But I think there's more to it than that like you said. I think me posting here is my only way of getting support. I don't want to vent to her and no one wants to support me trying to support her. This is the only place I have now."
GirlsxBattle2,f8xltfa,t1_f8vibpb,1574923235.0,"Thank you for responding! I keep getting a ton of caitlyns and nanis so I may build nani. Right now, my gambler hits really hard and my caitlyn does very little damage. However, both are 6 stars and I'm not sure if caitlyn starts to shine at +9*."
GirlsxBattle2,f8vblbu,t1_f8vafve,1574865354.0,I love gambler but allegedly she has no place late game. So it was refreshing to see her used. You think she was beneficial as dps?
GirlsxBattle2,f8vabs8,t3_e2cjwg,1574864374.0,Congrats! One of the most unique team comps posted! Rare to see gambler a part of anything of these challenges.

ptsd,ey4kzky,t1_ey3ee2e,1566796100.0,Thank you. I have to remind myself that on some days she's just going through a tough time. She's trying out new things and I'm glad she is. She's getting closer to finding a smoother path.
ptsd,ey4kvzm,t1_ey1h0jz,1566795992.0,I'm very proud and happy for you!
ptsd,ey4kuzv,t1_ey1fdes,1566795962.0,"I think it's a tough journey that becomes manageable in time. Check out the insightful things people have said in this post. I think every day should be taken slowly with time dedicated to self reflection and learning coping mechanisms. It isn't always quick and it isn't always flawless. So it's okay to take your time and to make mistakes. As long as you're trying, you will make improvements. Those improvements so small they won't always be noticed. I guess it's like going to the gym. You go once and look in the mirror and nothing. Go again: nothing. Go after a month: still nothing. But somewhere down the line the change happens. You can do it!"
ptsd,ey4i1ue,t1_ey2cpoc,1566793038.0,"Thank you for sharing. I feel like she's doing everything she can based off of what everyone is saying they did/do. She's really taking her lessons outside of therapy and implementing them. She reads into different kinds of therapy and ideologies. She has me reading The Body Keeps Score, and I really wish I read it sooner. I like to remind her every so often that I'm always there to help or that she's simply amazing for a variety of reasons."
ptsd,ey4hk22,t1_ey2e94f,1566792548.0,"Thank you for telling me your experience. She's been doing that and has been able to verbalize it to herself at the end of the day. I'm sure she goes through dips and turns. I tell her often that what she's doing is difficult but great, I'm here to always help, I support her decisions, etc. Sometimes I don't know if it's enough or maybe I'm being overbearing or believable about it. I don't tell her often maybe like once a month I'll give her a huge positive affirmation like above.

Edit: I should note that she was my gf, but she broke up with me to focus on her healing. Nearly 5 months later I'm still supporting her and waiting for her to be ready. Whether she wants that or not does suck for me, but I do wish for her to be better."
ptsd,ey1fz9c,t1_ey183sm,1566698640.0,"Thank you for sharing your experience. I'm sorry you're going through that struggle right now. Although it's a hard reality, it's assuring to know that despite hardship it does get better. It seems to oscillate between good and bad for most people. I'm trying to understand this process better so I can be a better friend for her."
ptsd,ey1dryq,t1_ey120df,1566696953.0,Thank you for sharing your personal experiences. I'm amazed you have come so far. The outcome of your experience gives me hope. I'm trying to be a better person for this friend and find ways to help her. I don't have ptsd so I'm trying to empathize by understanding the processes she may be going through. It's hard to know what healing is outside of therapy.
ptsd,ey1cnqf,t1_ey0z2tu,1566696074.0,Thank you for your input. I am trying to find ways to support her and I'll see this process as such. I think the best I can do for her is to build my understanding of ptsd to be more empathetic.
