Wow, I thought the Culling, Murphy hanging, and Lincoln torture happened in the latter half. I haven't watch Season 1 in *years*. I just remember the tone of the show being too happy in Season 1A, then it became more serious. Like the ""We're back bitches!"" and Imagine Dragins playing."

That would truly deepen the lore and the world by a large margin.  

It wouldn't just feel like Lexa, Roan, Luna, and hundreds of others. It would feel like a rich society that organically evolved after Apocalypse #1. This Prequel can create that, which I never felt while watching Season 3. The 12 Clans felt like a plot point, rather than the remnants of humanity."

This works because it is two complete clauses with parallel action verbs i.e. ""is"". The word ""being"" is needed in the second clause because Charlie is not normally rude and this specific time he is acting out-of-character.  

Another way to say this sentence is:
> Charlie is gentle by nature but rude this time.

Taking away the comma before ""but"" makes this one complete clause, while a comma then a conjunction creates two clauses. The verb ""is"" does not have to be repeated because the words ""gentle"" and ""rude"" connect back to it without any problem.
