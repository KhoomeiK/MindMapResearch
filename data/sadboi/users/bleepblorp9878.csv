AnimalCrossing,fpj6r0q,t3_gdlwmd,1588658241.0,"My island is growing, its simple but making me so happy. So far we are working on rainbow flower paths along the main pathways, a town shopping center and museum area with a fortune teller and sea shell salesmen (snappy turtles!!!) Complete with vending machines popcorn and fortune cookies....a very decorated beach area littered with flamingos and more to come as my friend aides in supply. There is also a children's playground. Then a very evenly spaced villager town sits across the river with fruit trees of all types around for their snacks. North of the villagers is a cliff with one side a small orchard and a brand new flower garden so we can see some pretty new colors like pink and blue for the villagers...then on the cliff is a mystery forest. It is unknown what lurks beyond but Apollo seems to enjoy hanging out there most. A top the cliff a spinning moon and 12 stones can be seen with one little aries star atop...maybe more shall appear....on the lower cliff as it stretches across the back island is a giant godzilla display to remember the ainecnt gods ofc, a more adult park with board games and painting, bqq set too, then a beehive farm and sitting area. Below again a wishing well and romantic picnic spot near a double heart lake. Pancake Island also has a lovely campground with camp stove, water pump, oil lamp and beach side sleeping bags :D Bob is currently camping but will soon be living with Hornsby (best), Wendy, Apollo, Flurry, Fauna, Claudia, Tank and the terrific stoner Kyle. Using my Amiibo to get Flora tho (duh) ;D"
