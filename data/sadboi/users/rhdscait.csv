BipolarReddit,fnyrjqd,t3_g4ns9b,1587372967.0,"Maybe your Lamictal needs to be upped to prevent a manic episode. I’m no doctor, though. Lamictal alone wasn’t enough for me. My combo of Lamictal, Latuda, and Buspar knock me out for the night around 9 pm. Some drugs, combined with others, cause drowsiness as a side effect. It’s worked in my favor thus far."
BipolarReddit,fnn61ae,t3_g2o5zz,1587085180.0,Lamictal and Latuda have been most effective for me.
bipolar,fnc5vnl,t3_g0ufzb,1586829281.0,My dose of 200mg has helped me tremendously. I’d say it doesn’t work well on its own as I’m also on 40mg of Latuda. These two together are my gold standard. I feel more like myself than ever before (but I still have normal ups and downs now).
BipolarReddit,fnbdj9s,t3_g0rnvq,1586813620.0,"I think there’s an increased risk of bipolar if a parent has the condition. I’ve been married for ten years and have two sons. In addition to being bipolar, I have autism. They both inherited my autism but it’s too early to tell on the bipolar thing. If I had to guess, my youngest son (who also has ADHD) would be very high risk. His disposition just seems like the perfect storm for bipolar. Having kids and struggling so much myself has been a challenge. I’m finally becoming stable after years of instability. I think finding someone who puts up with the ups and downs of bipolar can be the biggest hurdle. There’s a lot of people just not willing to deal with that shit. I lucked out and my husband has been a saint. But, his own mom is bipolar so he has experience. Whatever decisions you make, be sure that your partner is all in before having kids. I can’t imagine how difficult it would be to be a single parent with bipolar. Parenthood in itself is stressful enough without adding mental illness into the mix."

I watched my dad die last April and it still haunts me. We knew it was coming as he had a rare form of cancer in which it took him just three months after diagnosis. He died in his own bed at home. We were told that his hearing would be the last to go so we shared our favorite memories together, played some Pink Floyd (his favorite musicians), and just chatted like he was there. I held on to his hand and the last words I said to him were, “Sleep well, dad.” It was so tough not to break down but we tried to stay strong for his sake. I owe him a great deal of gratitude for allowing me the opportunity to see what death really looks like. It’s not at all the way it’s portrayed in movies. Hauntingly peaceful is the best way I could describe it. I still think about his death daily but seeing how death occurs has brought me a great sense of ease thinking about my own mortality."

BipolarReddit,fi4je1o,t1_fh2kj21,1582142366.0,"I’m really, really late to reply but wanted to thank you for your reply. I talked to my doctor and he prescribed Buspar for my anxiety. I’ve been on it for almost two weeks now and I’m not as restless or anxious. I still get restless after taking Latuda but not as bad. My tics are pretty bad after starting Buspar (I also have Tourette’s) so I’m not sure if it will work long term or not.  I will mention cogentin to my doctor at my next med check.  He seems pretty hesitant to add more meds (I’m an at risk patient for some side effects) but it’s worth a shot. He seems to really care about how I’m reacting to the meds so maybe he’ll care enough to consider cogentin. On the plus side, while my anxiety is still there, I’m not fixating on death as much now."
BipolarReddit,fh1j3cv,t3_f10lk5,1581216336.0,"My first manic episode was a year long. Afterward, I fell into a deep deep depression that lasted about three years, with a few bits of mania here and there. When the depression hit, I was so damn exhausted from the mania. I truly don’t know how I or my husband survived that time. I was seeing demons and hearing voices and convinced people were out to get me. I accused my husband of terrible things and was violent with him. Somehow, I managed to escape being hospitalized. Even now, when I’m manic I get psychosis. That’s the earmark of my mania. When I start hearing and seeing things, I know it’s bad. Then I started ultra rapid cycling within the past two years. I’m on meds now and I’m just kind of here. No passion and not terribly depressed, just really anxious about things out of my control (I think it’s med induced, though)."

Listening to music has helped a little but I’m still struggling. I spent the day at my mom’s house, with my kids, and it was a really pleasant day. I stayed busy and was able to keep my mind off of the thoughts for a good portion of the day. I’ve been taking notes about my thoughts so that I can discuss them with my doctor."

I guess the thought of just ceasing to exist is the part that frightens me the most."

No one in my real life seems to understand just how severe this anxiety is. They keep suggesting I just don’t think about it but it’s not that easy. It has consumed my brain at this point. I try to push myself to stay busy but there are those thoughts saying, “What’s the point in doing any of this? You’re going to be dead someday anyway.”  

I’m glad you’re better now and you’ve found some meds that work well for you!  That, I think, is the biggest part of stability for us. And congratulations on getting sober!  ❤️"

I do have two kids. They both have autism (as do I) and one has a really bad case of ADHD so I venture to say that’s part of my issue. Parenting them is not easy and it fucking sucks most of the time. I don’t have much of an emotional connection with them and no matter how hard I try, I just gets insults hurled at me or their fists. My dad was the one person I confided in. He was there to make my every dream come true. I should’ve been more grateful for him when he was alive. I’ve got a lot of guilt about the way I treated him.

I’ve got executive functioning issues because of my autism so having a visual really helps me. Saying stuff in my head just isn’t enough. The more I dwell on stuff in my head, the more overwhelmed I get.  Listening to music while doing tasks really helps me, too. I’ve got earbuds in most of the day.  That’s the only way I can get the trite tasks done."

BipolarReddit,faoknz4,t3_ea277k,1576266491.0,"I had this when I started Lamictal. I’m at 200 now and as another poster said, my head just is more quiet now. My thoughts aren’t as loud and I’m better able to cope with the depressive thoughts. I’d say 150 was when things really started to improve."
BipolarReddit,faok5l8,t3_ea8mqw,1576266166.0,I’d seek out the opinion of a psychiatrist. They are the ones that can issue medication.
BipolarReddit,faohy9n,t3_ea6n8x,1576264751.0,"Existential dread, cold, dark, empty, dull, and lacking vibrance. It feels like a cold chill on a barren winter’s morning. Nothing brings warmth or peace. My senses are dampened, my body feels like lead, and my head somehow feels less buoyant. Everything is just white, black, and grey. Colors start to fade and my eyes grow heavier until all of my energy is exerted into just staying alive. I try to speak but even my own voice sounds muffled in my head. If the depression is really bad, I eventually lose even the energy to speak. I leave my body to try to fight the thoughts in my head. It’s a darkness that keeps pulling me inward. The harder I try to fight, the stronger its grip."

BipolarReddit,f9zd3t2,t3_e7fcr6,1575740690.0,"Lost my license for 60 days for reckless driving, opened 6 credit cards and maxed them all out at $25k, married my husband within a month of meeting him, and the list goes on. Right after getting my license back, I got three more speeding tickets. Probably the weirdest thing is that I get this consistent idea, every time I’m manic, that I’m a witch with actual powers so I commune with the forest spirits and the only friend I have is a demon who I talk to and plot with on what to do if someone finds out about him. Yeah, mania for me is a real trip."
BipolarReddit,f9jsjso,t1_f9jsami,1575384683.0,I’ve been taking it for about 3 months now. I’m glad to know the side effects may not last long term.
