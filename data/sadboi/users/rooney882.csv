depression,f3gr9jp,t3_dgxtv1,1570914367.0,I was wondering about how people hear a voice telling them to kill themselves. Because for me it’s always been me telling myself that I should do it
depression,f2ymtdy,t1_f2ycj9r,1570494146.0,Yeah the rest of the days I’m similar to you. It’s just enough to be able to still get up and get some shit done but the pain is still all there
depression,f2y7mix,t3_deojkv,1570487165.0,"I mean with a subreddit that the majority of members are severely depressed people, I’m not surprised that posts don’t get responded to often. People probably just don’t have the energy to bother responding or simply don’t know what to say. I know for me sometimes I just wanna come on here and read stuff."
depression,f2y6veu,t3_den325,1570486901.0,Man dreams are the worst. I don’t have very realistic dreams but they are very emotional. I will just dream about being surrounded by people and then they all just start ignoring me and leaving me. Then I wake up at 3am with this crushing feeling of loneliness inside.
depression,f2y64wb,t3_dep61r,1570486641.0,The part about waking up happy. I recently went on a new medication and there were 3 days last week where I actually woke up happy and couldn’t feel anything bad at all. It was the weirdest thing because it’s been so long since I’ve felt that feeling.
depression,f2y5ozc,t1_f2w90mm,1570486486.0,"Yeah although sometimes I’m glad depression makes you really tired. Because it makes getting to sleep any time really easy, so I can forget I’m alive"

depression,f287srs,t1_f27cnaq,1570054726.0,So what did you do that helped you get out of depression after 37 years
depression,f287o8m,t1_f277v9r,1570054642.0,Yeah for sure. I’m either embracing of death or it scares the shit out of me.
depression,f287m83,t1_f276zbc,1570054604.0,Yeah I’ve never gone past just thinking about it over and over in my head. I hope your doing ok
depression,f287jya,t1_f26jhn3,1570054562.0,Yeah that explains it well
depression,f287d3w,t1_f26i1vr,1570054434.0,"Yeah definitely does, like I’m gonna live out my life not being able to find the same level of success and happiness because I’ll be bogged down. If that’s what you meant."
depression,f2879fu,t1_f26h6j2,1570054365.0,"Yeah I’ve told like one friend about my thoughts, not in this way though. And they were very shocked it kinda made me realise how not normal it is for most people to think about death"
depression,f28757s,t1_f27jqt0,1570054283.0,"I’m not saying suicide will be comforting, but the thoughts in my head can make me feel a lot better some of the time. As counter intuitive as that is. Doesn’t mean I’m gonna give up I don’t plan on committing suicide any time soon, but the thoughts are very comforting"
depression,f26ihpp,t3_dc5vn7,1570012046.0,I suppose you need to realise that they will only be able to properly help you if you be honest. I have a lot of trouble as well but it’s important you bring stuff up even if it makes you uncomfortable. Good luck
depression,f26fa2w,t1_f268ugh,1570007204.0,That’s a very interesting perspective actually
selfharm,f221xi8,t1_f204ar7,1569880257.0,"Hey thanks for the reply, unfortunately I just hate myself. I’ve never liked myself my whole life always wanting to be other people and after all those years it’s culminated in pretty nasty depression. So I guess I need to learn to like myself a bit more"

selfharm,f1e2rec,t3_d8xtoj,1569410796.0,Yes I get this a lot. It’s like a burning anger inside you and you just really wanna fucking hurt yourself
selfharm,f0x871n,t3_d70b2k,1569024614.0,"Well in theory if the urge was gone, hopefully whatever bad stuff was happening to you that was causing the urge might have stopped. Which would definitely be good"

Like you said at first it’s super nice, but it just becomes a reminder yeah. That’s why anyone who’s reading this and hasn’t spoken to many people.

depression,f0ugrhg,t3_d6m9zy,1568940338.0,"Wow you just spoke some mad truth, I would just like to add that if you do open up about being depressed and more specifically suicidal. Then everyone starts treating you differently. It’s so annoying because now I have people who are always watching how I behave and then if they think I’m not doing well they fucking report that to my parents or some shit and they thinks that’s gonna help. Like now I’m being treated like an animal people are trying to keep alive rather than an actual human being."
depression,f0u79is,t1_f0u48pk,1568935342.0,"Yeah good idea, when they used to treat me ‘normally’ they Just wouldn’t really talk to me because they thought I wasn’t interested, but I really i was just struggling mentally. so I guess I should tell them I wanna get out more and do more stuff"

depression,ezifovs,t1_eziedvs,1567926301.0,"Alright, I would definitely talk to your GP or a psychiatrist if you are concerned. If you think it might be bipolar maybe do some reading into it I guess

From my understanding (so I might be wrong) the key part of bipolar is that the mood swings are unnatural. In other words when you are in happy moods it is very much unusually happy, as opposed to just having a good day. Also look out for things like not sleeping much or at all and feeling full of ideas. Whatever it ends up being, I wish you luck :)"
depression,ezid1q0,t3_d173js,1567925044.0,"Yeah this happened to me too. If you are on antidepressants, specifically an SSRI, there can be mood swings or changes that are the result of the medication. In my case and many others these present as periods of mania or hypomania, which then looks like bipolar disorder but definitely isn’t. Hope this helps some people :)"
