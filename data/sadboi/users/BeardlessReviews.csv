ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fkrbot2,t1_fkrar50,1584465676.0,"This is a useful argument down the line. The problem I’m trying to get at is that it’s not that time yet, and in this context it is used primarily to undermine Bernie’s campaign. I get that there legitimately are Bernie or Bust folks. Some of them are no doubt extremely angry by the Democratic Party’s shitty behavior all this time fueling this anger. But again, saying this as a response to people who announce that they are Bernie or Bust in public really doesn’t help the situation. You are once again signaling to people that THIS is somehow an accurate portrayal who the Sanders crowd is and ignoring all the context that may have led to this conclusion, which leads to more dismissal and more anger. Hopefully we’re not at the point of outright universal name-calling (although “Bernie Bros” has been gaining traction in lumping us all in as people not worthy to be listened to), but these are still legitimately unfair tactics to plant the idea into the public’s head that we are lesser. You never see these people self-criticizing the Biden or Bust folks. They treat the progressives largely as an “other” and that if we don’t assimilate (mind you, specifically when there is no need to do so) we are the problem.

It’s really fucking evil to hide behind a “moral dilemma” as a way to do this because every time anyone calls you out for bias that will impact how millions might see a specific group of people you claim to be an impartial philosopher. Like there are times you call people out for doing the wrong thing and asking for reasonable change with explanations, but obviously that’s not happening here.

And again, I’m not saying some of the Sanders crowd doesn’t do some of this shit too. If this is how the game is played I would think it necessary to. They just don’t have as large a platform (I guess collectively you could argue they could, but I guess I’d wait for you to present the data rather than arguing with myself on a hypothetical I don’t believe there is reason to assume there). It is then morally irresponsible to continue this. I also get that there may be people who are led to believe these questions are legitimate, and all I’m hoping is that by continuing to expose how fallacious this stuff is that people realize it’s not the question itself that’s being censored but the context that makes it harmful. It is not solely the fault of the question being asked, but that the context of how the real world treats that question that makes it a bad thing to spread at the moment. This is true for issues on race, mental illness, sexuality, gender, art, the responsibilities of celebrities, comedy, etc. There’s a time for everything, and that time is certainly not when it’s going to be used to punch down. It also helps if you’re self-criticizing rather than trying to shame an outgroup. Again, offer advice and insight for individual things but don’t sweep people up into myths.

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fkr9t4p,t1_fkr8k0j,1584464616.0,"Like most centrist arguments, this sounds great in a vacuum except we don’t live in a vacuum where loudly pondering the epistemology of these things doesn’t have an effect on reality. Yes, it’s probably a useful discussion to have to convince people to vote for the lesser of two evils. 

Except it has CONTINUOUSLY been used to somehow depict “Bernie Bros” as uncooperative before the fact and that Sanders is guilty by association and THEREFORE we should only care about Biden and not listen to anything Sanders has to offer. This is why people are upset that these people continue to say this shit before the primaries are over. It’s a tactic that’s been used before, and of course they lump in all the progressives when they inevitably don’t have enough support as this “cult” mind that doesn’t accept compromise. The centrists in the Democratic Party have almost always refused to respect the progressives, always acting as though a vote for “our” candidates is always wasted and then abusively telling us that we’re ruining the country if we don’t support them for the nth time (then turning around and claiming that our similarly sized toxic minority with less of a formal platform is the REAL problem). It’s a convenient way to pretend like they simply just care about the morals here when pretty much all they use it for is to insinuate that our concerns are not worthwhile. Then this idea spreads and it becomes somehow pivotal that Bernie supporters answer this NOW, when they don’t even have to make the decision yet, or they’re somehow the morally worse people. Like seriously centrists have pulled a lot of dogshit and this seemingly innocent question has been used again and again in whatever discussion about Sanders’ candidacy, telling the public it’s okay to undermine whatever we want because it portrays us, either directly or indirectly with the help of some nice “opinion pieces”, as not worthy to be listened to. 

Edit: It also pre-plants the idea in people’s heads that there is no chance Sanders will actually face Trump in the general. While I admit we’d need a minor miracle to convince this country to elect Sanders at this point, this has been used again and again to shame people."

I’ve had mixed results with solution-based therapy but I might try to request CBT again even if it’s really just gonna be for coping. I’m tired I guess of feeling like I’m always just coping. I mean it’s one thing if it’s coping with shitty politics, but it’s another thing entirely to be coping with loneliness because I mean the former is clearly wrong and you can fight to change but the latter is like... I’m not entitled to anyone’s affections or care. Sometimes I feel like a nomad trying to find people to relate to. It genuinely feels like I could live my whole life alone and it wouldn’t be fundamentally wrong. And I guess that upsets me quite a bit.

Recently I’ve been using therapy so that most of the negative shit I say isn’t to people in my life who probably don’t want to hear that stuff from me.

Edit because this is important: none of this is meant to downplay TRYING therapy over and over and going to different therapists when one doesn’t work. I’ve often felt like that’s been the only way I can truly even do anything about my situation, especially since medicine does nothing (for me).

The only way you bringing up that “other countries do something similar” is at all relevant to the discussion is if it is being used as a defense of China. I have to presume that you’re not just a dumbass who brings up irrelevant shit to arguments. It’s the Cooperation Principle.

dating_advice,fenh750,t1_fen5waz,1579284611.0,"First of all, a few years ago I was a self-proclaimed “incel” before I realized that term didn’t describe me because 1) I realized I didn’t even want sex (I’m graysexual) and 2) I learned that term was being used by terrorists and those cheering them on. I have not had a romantic relationship or a date for five years and on several occasions I have experienced the pain of feeling hopelessly alone. And I feel ashamed of that too, but it’s important to realize that there’s a difference between feeling emotions or wanting (to be) something, and blatantly ignoring the consequences to fulfill your desires. 

Second, I want to leave you with this thought: If everyone argued that only people who experienced the exact same situations could properly communicate/give advice/give arguments to one another, we would have no possibility whatsoever of learning from one another or making a democratic government. The history of law has shown that that isn’t true. I empathize with what you may be experiencing, but even if I didn’t have what I see as similar experiences, it is a cultish argument to dismiss people solely on the basis that they don’t have those experiences. The whole purpose of argument is to convince someone who has similar VALUES to you that what you’re arguing for is worthwhile. So, if you have the value that demeaning people based off of situations they cannot reasonably control is wrong, then I hope you see why I and many of the people I’m speaking for are upset at “nice guys”. Otherwise, I hope you at least understand why there is no sympathy among people who are already oppressed for the woes of those calling for their oppression. Best of luck."
dating_advice,femy071,t1_femg08n,1579272523.0,"I’m going to try to explain for you one time, because I do not know (based on what I’ve seen from you so far) if you’re genuinely confused or not. Also since this is a dating advice subreddit.

First of all; Most people (including me) are weary interacting with self-proclaimed “nice guys” because of their known detachment from reality and extreme anger they self-justify. I will explain more about this and how it relates to the idea that (rightfully) no one here is willing to sympathize with someone who unironically calls themselves a “nice guy”. Secondly, I want you to know (in case you didn’t) that your “nice guy opinion” is and has been used extensively as a dogwhistle that suggests women are incapable of thought or empathy. That’s a pretty shitty thing to be suggesting, and I assume it also greatly affects how you and those you’re aligning with interact with or treat women. No one is reasonably going to take that, because it is a selfish thought already shown to have terrible consequences.

I empathize with you if you feel alone and unwanted, but to use that as an excuse to demean the people who reject you is awful. It also does not help that many self-proclaimed “nice guys” also go on to harass and INTENTIONALLY try to gaslight or hurt the people who reject them.

You have to understand this in order to healthily interact with people in the “real” world: No one owes you love. It hurts to not have it, and sometimes I get it feels as though no matter what you try that’s your destiny, but it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy if you start sinking into the rabbit hole of blaming others who had nothing to do with you in the first place (and once you sink far enough, wishing to hurt them). If you want help, it’s far healthier and more productive to present your feelings like “I feel alone and I don’t know what to do because the dates I’ve tried haven’t worked” rather than “they don’t want me because I’m not an alpha make stereotype”. The latter is not only largely untrue, but as I mentioned before, dangerous propaganda that relieves you of responsibility for any of your actions. Feels nice, but in a society that is especially concerned about the rights of minorities, parading that portrayal around is bound to get ridiculed because it inherently demeans an entire group of people who were born that way, and is also just stupid. And certainly don’t align yourself with terms like “nice guy” if you want people to take your pain seriously.

This also doesn’t mean you have to blame yourself solely. Sometimes it’s really just bad luck that you’re still single or something similar. Take whatever hardships, learn what you can do for yourself from them, and try to move on. There’s really no need to pressure yourself to move into a relationship you and your SO would be unhappy with, just because of the fear and pain surrounding being lonely. That won’t solve anything, and I’d argue would make things worse.

I will say that, based off of the two comments I see from you here, some of the responses to you in this thread have been a little too harsh (nothing you have said has been as absurd as some of the top posts on r/niceguys, as another commenter suggested). However, just like if you proclaimed yourself to be a Nazi you would/should get called out for being a violent racist without a benefit of the doubt, you also rightfully get backlash for aligning yourself with people known for promoting misogyny. It’s your responsibility to try and meet people halfway, not with some blanket “ALL WOMEN ONLY LIKE THIS” but by actually coming to understand what each individual thinks, because in the end that’s your choice. I hope what I’m saying helps you and some others understand the reasoning behind the discretion towards “nice guys”, and especially when you use it as a way to justify cultish thoughts."

JusticeServed,fdqk0xr,t1_fdqhff2,1578668543.0,"On the topic of pedophiles: I really think we need to do something about them. We currently have no real way to “reform” people who are born with pedophilic sexual desires. I still believe there is a difference between a pedophile and an actual child molester or someone actually acting on desires to hurt children, and we need to find a way to reasonably cut off that connection instead of presenting it as a self-fulfilling prophecy. But when we can’t even get people with pedophilic tendencies to be involved in scientific research to figure out more about what we can do, I really don’t know how we can make these reforms. Our attitude towards pedophiles is (rightfully) so hostile, that I fear we are damning them to be the shitty people we deem them to be (somewhat analogous to witches). The major difference being, of course, that what pedophiles want cannot be under ANY circumstances be allowed; and pretty much everyone arguing for pedophiles to have some kind of path to recovery is almost always automatically received as DEFENDING pedophiles.

The only real idea I have is to add stuff in sex ed where we can teach children about resources to deal with sexual desires that exist on a flimsy moral line and to teach morality (in terms of legal morality or the reasoning behind the laws in the first place, such as why grooming is a terrible thing or consent is incredibly important etc.). However, it’s probably not gonna happen because just getting sex ed in the first place currently is absolutely fucked. And it’s absolutely gonna encourage religious propaganda as sex ed (e.g. some fucking school out there brainwashing kids about “hymens”). But I guess it’s the “more speech” argument I guess. Also a lot of concerns already about people dealing with children about sensitive subjects.

Regardless, I do not believe the “gut reaction” you’re describing is wrong. I think it’s normal to feel like enacting violence onto people who do (or want to do) atrocious things. But this feeling is way too often used to scapegoat people and just isn’t what our legal system should strive to be. It’s the difference between an “assumption” and a “presumption” (of innocence). Pedophiles, for instance, suck, but if they don’t do anything illegal the least we can do is try to provide a path for them to get some help and be functional members of society."
JusticeServed,fdqf2vf,t1_fdqdmz0,1578665022.0,"My intended implication was not that spiritual people are less likely to adapt to prison, but more likely to have received practically no punishment from the death penalty, which the comments beneath you are praising like it’s the preferable option here.

Let’s say hypothetically people are somehow LESS scared of being denied freedom than of dying. We should still absolutely not be pushing for the death penalty. The justice system using the death penalty is an perverse hypocrisy on justice. If it’s true that prisons are “just as good” as living outside, or better, we need to change THAT, NOT bring it back (or if you’re in a particularly backwards developed country, keep it). The only time someone should be legally killed by the court is if the person presents such a clear imminent danger that we have literally no other choice.

No other circumstance should the death penalty be permissible, much less encouraged as much as it is in this thread. Even if prisoners are “hopeful”, as long as they are being denied freedoms that’s perfectly fine with me.

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fcsr4a1,t1_fcsg41x,1577922990.0,"What you’re saying seems fine. But I think you’re missing the point of this sub and its concept of “centrism”. Most of what is posted here is in regards to people’s rights to exist. The most common joke I’ve seen here is something along the lines of:

Nazi: Genocide is good

Normal person: This guy is a fucking lunatic, can we please get this guy to stfu

Centrist: *some false equivalence about how we have to be tolerant and want to destroy society*

A comment above summarized it pretty well I think in saying being NEUTRAL is completely fine, but “centrism” (which apparently we’re struggling to have a definition on in this thread) is a joke.

When I first found this sub I was pretty confused too. I STILL don’t think EVERY single “conservative” idea out there is completely outrageous, even though I have virtually no trust in the people representing “the right” in my country or most countries anymore. In specific policy debates, I absolutely still want people arguing for “conservative” ideas. I initially thought this made me a “centrist” and felt like this sub was straw-manning me. After lurking for a while though, I want to say that I think this is absolutely not the case, and the confusion around the word “centrist” oftentimes leaves “visitors” here left out.

According to this sub, I am absolutely not a centrist for wanting to “hear both sides”. The problem most people have is that at this point and time it seems like people on the right are batshit crazy and their PRIMARY arguments revolve around “values” or “there’s always a bigger fish” scenarios that involve neglecting people’s rights. This creates paradoxical situations where “hearing both sides” involves giving platform to people who believe in and advocate for white supremacy and other batshit insane ideas. 

I am willing to believe that some of this has to do with trolls; I saw an article sometime ago about how “professional” trolls on the internet help to make it seem as though absolutely no middle ground can be achieved because the “other side” does not want to cooperate. I have no idea what the actual statistics are here, and I did not pay much attention to politics before Trump came into office so I have no personal frame of reference, but imo and the opinions of most people it has reached a point where it does not matter. People have their extreme echo chambers, and most attempts at listening to the loudest people on “the right” are futile because they constantly clash on basic values. Wanting to cut off these conversations is not going to lead to misunderstanding, because most people I know believe there is absolutely nothing that can be done to convert people who want white supremacy or heteronormativity. They’ve already decided, basically. Pretty much all of these “debates” involve “owning the libs” or some other form of ad hominem or fucking up some other basic pragma-dialectical rule proudly. Does this mean ALL interactions between political “parties” or thought are fucked? Absolutely not. But people are tired of having “debates” on whether or not people deserve to exist. It’s been pointless, and people here believe it gives these “arguments” legitimacy. So the sub basically just tries instead to make fun of the lunatics.

Whether it’s still “noble” to TRY to reconcile the two is also pretty fucked because of this. In productive arguments, people can be convinced if you manage to find specific things they value and convince them that if they value that they SHOULD also value what you’re arguing for. But this falls completely flat on its face when people are PROUD to be hypocrites. And then turn around with some absurd, mildly related aboutism to JUSTIFY being shitty human beings.

And I have a hard time believing most of this is from trolls. It is extremely concerning to me that (for example) not a single Republican voted for the impeachment of Trump. Also the Senate thing. So while I suspect there are certainly fake stories out there designed to breed mistrust, it also seems like it doesn’t matter because to me and most people on “the left” I assume, these people are still complicit (I mean the OP jokes about this too). Also most of the misleading stories I’ve seen are from Fox News.

So yeah, in a gracious world where Republicans aren’t deliberately trying to mess with democracy or giving people basic rights, etc., and conservatives/centrists aren’t complicit to this, most sane people I would assume would absolutely try to debate issues from “both sides”. But it’s commonly argued here and in other places now that not only is it useless, it makes things worse. Republicans are illegitimate. We aren’t going to sit here and pretend they are. “Centrists”, however this sub defines them, do.

Generally no one is making fun of people who “just want to talk”. Sometimes I’ve seen people assume these people are trying to dog whistle or something, which can result in misunderstanding. This sub generally is done with people claiming they “just want to talk” though, for the reasons I’ve tried to outline above."

I understand simply imposing taxes or whatever on the rich is not going to solve everything, even if they do pay up. There’s naturally going to be a lot of tension regardless, and we’re not suddenly making everyone happy or even as well-off. Which is why we also need to make sure we are taking some kind of dynamic approach. But my point is that it should not just be a “that’s how life is, sucks to be you” conclusion. I believe there’s a responsibility to figure out improvements, and though I don’t personally have a perfect “solution” I don’t think the debate warrants one if there’s nothing better.

It’s people who believe their success comes from primarily anything other than luck (e.g. divine intervention, bootstrapping) that we get people justifying putting other people down.

Even if it is found that a majority of, or every last one of, the people suffering is a lazy motherfucker, they deserve a fucking chance.

depression,fb8u5s7,t3_ebwcx8,1576621958.0,"I would recommend setting your date to 2030. I hate to be all “you’re too young”, but there is likely still opportunity for you since you’re 21.

I don’t know if you’re in college, or finding jobs, or finding dates, or trying to self-improve through therapy, but my point is all of this is still relatively possible in these early adult years. There can still be significant change in your life over these years.

I get it. It sucks trying and trying for some kind of happy life that’s likely(?) never gonna happen. But I believe you can still try to get closer to there. I believe in you. I totally agree that setting a date helps because I think unnecessary suffering is trash, but I just think you should set the date farther down the line? Because I believe there’s still hope for you and I?"
depression,fb6y4tt,t3_ebgvd3,1576564854.0,"There are a couple reasons I can think of for you for your main question (why won’t they let me kill myself?) that have not been mentioned:

1. I assume most of your experience with people telling you suicide is not an option for you is from childhood (since you say that you’ve had 18 years of experience and are still in school; I could be wrong, feel free to correct me). Children inherently get less rights because they are deemed to be incapable to think for themselves due to lack of experience and biological underdevelopment. This is NOT meant to imply that what you’re going through is invalid. Instead, it implies that you are not yet fully in control of your actions, so you therefore cannot be responsible for your own death. The responsibility then shifts onto society to protect you from yourself until you are of sound mind.

2. Suicide ideation is seen as a symptom/strong indicator of mental illness. I mean you’re also posting this in r/depression so I assume you might be diagnosed for a mental illness? Mental illness is the other criteria we have for deeming people to not have control over their actions. So, once again, if you are deemed to have no control, your control is relinquished to other people who are “in charge” of you. Be it your parents/guardians or authorities. The only way you can convince people, with reason, that you should be given the right to kill yourself is if you can prove that you are of sound mind and in control of your actions. But this is pretty much fucking impossible unfortunately, because suicide ideation is (again) seen as inseparable from mental illness for most people I know. 

I personally think that if you’ve wanted to kill yourself for idk however many set years and your health diagnoses throughout those years do not indicate HEAVY mental illness, you should be able to, because your body belongs to yourself and if you consent to that shit (which I mean it’s literally YOUR decision for YOURSELF) then reasonably it’s not anyone else’s business (aside from things like deterrence or if you’re really important to certain people, but those are arguments I think have already been brought up in the comments and by the OP). Because at that point imo I don’t think it makes sense to continue to believe that you do not have the choice. Mental illness, especially when we aren’t even talking about a specific one and just guessing based on the symptom of suicide ideation, does not equate to complete inability to make decisions.

I completely understand that it would be seen as LUDICROUS to get people to receive diagnoses documentation to “justify” their suicide. But otherwise I have no idea how anyone can reasonably convince someone that their suicide was actually their own choice, and convince anyone that they shouldn’t worry about the suicide. And this is, again, not including the other arguments for you not committing suicide EVEN IF you were determined to be of sound mind.

Conclusion: So basically since it is seen that committing suicide was not actually your choice, it is seen as a failure on society to protect you from outside influences. It is seen that, if they keep you alive, there is potential to rehabilitate you so that you can come out sound. It’s the same reason why we try to protect children from shit. The problem is that, in my opinion, it completely discounts circumstances in which suicide is a legitimate choice. Like, okay, maybe I’m not of completely sound mind (I’m really curious how much of the population actually is). Does that mean I never get to make any choice ever? Does that alternatively mean everything I do cannot be my fault because I am not of sound mind? These are terrible implications for sure. It’s currently difficult to convince anyone, however, that you’re making a sound-minded choice when you choose suicide. 

Criticize me if this is a terrible analogy but it is somewhat similar to some terrible arguments against homosexuality (or other sexualities/gender identities) I’ve come across: that no “sound-minded” person would do such a thing, so therefore we cannot give them the choice to do that. You’re basically pseudo-diagnosed based on your decision so people can take away your freedom of choice “for your own good”. Both of these issues have been seen as closely related to mental disorders, but I think it’s really time to fucking question if suicide ideation can be torn away from that shit.

And also even if it wasn’t even a “sound-minded” choice, why the fuck would we think it’s a better idea to have you suffer for decades instead of “ending the suffering”? Like I believe at a certain point there’s nothing anyone can do? For the “children” argument, there is at least the hope that they grow into adulthood and then can make the decisions for themselves. But for many people who will suffer from mental illness their whole lives, that’s not a hope. There’s no “end date” for the illness. But then that goes into the whole “how do we know we did everything we could to determine when to allow that” problem."

1. I’m part of an eSports team in a tactical shooter. My Captain gets frustrated, as I assume captains do, but doesn’t actually organize us to do anything when we’re stuck in a rut. Also he gets frustrated every game when we start losing. His fall-back plan is always for us to mute ourselves and to STOP using strats or use some predictable/cheap tactic only the lowest tier players would struggle to face (rushing). So any time I’m trying to strategize something, which is pretty much the point of the game, I get told to shut up and get blamed if anything bad happens. Keep in mind the only reason I’m part of an eSports team is, while I’m not insane at shooting, I like to work together in teams. We often start games without even having dedicated roles for everyone. So yeah, complete waste of my dedication. Very disheartening.

2. Besides that, just general loneliness. My closest friends all drink. I don’t. Bam, something I can’t be part of. Oh also trying to find a date is impossible for a couple reasons: 1) I’m asexual and 2) if it isn’t somewhat seeping through in this post, I talk weird/non-traditionally or something apparently. So even though I’ve got some pretty good friends, there’s always so much isolation. They’re usually busy, as most people are, but it’s hard to even relate to them in my free time. The drinking is just one aspect. Most of the things I do in my free time are “outsider” enough to make it hard to bring up in general conversation, but not “outsider” enough to relate to the people who I look up to who analyze this stuff as their main passion. Also it’s just hard to hear what people are saying irl. I swear I have to ask people to repeat what they say embarrassingly often. I feel like a nuisance there, and also as a roommate or friend (when we’re trying to get around). Like nothing I bring to the table is very useful. And the things I perceive myself to be useful in I don’t think are as important to anyone else. Also difficulty relating to mom.

3. I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m trying to learn but I don’t know what the absolute heck I’m doing. I feel like my college semesters go by so fast and I don’t feel a solid sense of direction of where I’m going with learning. I do feel like I made a lot of cringey mistakes in my past though. I don’t get hung up on them, but yeah it’s more of that “I don’t know what I’m doing” shit.

4. I generally have a lot of doubt of many things. I think it’s important to be critical of things, since you know that’s kinda what we built humanity to be. However, it ends up just feeling isolating when I can’t relate to my own political party or people in the same in-groups as me (at least based on its media presence), since it feels like I have to be critical of so much and it generally encounters “overwhelming” resistance.

5. My sadness is also something I find it difficult to relate to anyone on. Nothing terribly traumatic has happened to me, for one. I also have suicide ideation, but I don’t hurt myself or even think suicide is a valid option. And no, I don’t think suicide is not good because of my family or anything. I have my own reasons I have yet to find someone else who shares. Oh also people also regularly assume when I’m sad it means I lack self-love, since that’s the first piece of advice people will give you. Yes, I love myself. I love my values and how I follow them. I think I’m beautiful or whatever else cheesy shit I need to say to “convince” people of my identity. But idk maybe no one else considers that loving yourself doesn’t solve anything. I still have to live my life of isolation and confusion. Sure, I’m getting through life. But that’s like fixing your controller only to find out the game you’re playing is a couple decades of walking around aimlessly.

6. Also that asexuality aspect I mentioned. Most of the asexuals I’ve met are homoromantic to my knowledge. Also the without-trauma thing (I do not assume all my peers have trauma or something, but I do feel like it’s difficult to relate to anyone without a reason to be sad). I don’t even know what to say when people ask for my “pronouns” because it just isn’t important to me. Also obviously not caring about sex makes general conversations with peers sometimes isolating as well. 

7. Also cultural identity. Chinese American who can’t speak Mandarin very well and constantly sees “my country” doing things that conflict with what I feel. Actually this applies to both halves of my cultural identity.

In short, I feel like a minority of a minority of a minority in every part of my identity. Any time I bring it up, the general dismissal is that I’m “trying to be edgy” and if I just be normal or whatever then everything will be okay. Well I would love to be born “normal” in either my suffering or my interests. But I am proud of who I am, as broken as it got me, and I’m gonna continue to try (this is my attempt to dissuade people from giving the same unhelpful general advice I’ve received every time I post something like this, if I get any responses at all). I mean it’s not like it’s honorable or anything when there’s literally nothing else to do. So yeah I apologize if somehow me feeling isolated makes you feel weird or something enough to accuse me of purposefully isolating myself. Not everything is up to me, and I’m doing the best I can. I’m not asking for anything to change for me in this particular post (although I would love to find people I can relate to more).

And this post is not a reflection of everything going on. I obviously do do things that are relatively successful or useful. I am aware of that. I’m also not always negative in my speech. The problem is most of that stuff is either unimportant to me or doesn’t get me anywhere in terms of happiness. Like a squirrel can cut out the power in an entire city, but does that make the squirrel giddy with excitement of his power over the universe (actually the squirrel is probably a bad example, since it probably does)?

I mean... the way I see it 1) life ends anyways 2) once it ends there’s no going back and 3) life at least we know has a CHANCE of being better. I mean even if death turns out to be the most beautiful, magnificent, amazing thing... we get to experience it in the end anyways. But if it doesn’t turn out so great and it can’t be changed at all, at least we can be like... well my life was pretty garbage but hey at least I saw a band I like perform that one time. Idk... I understand life is really shitty and wanting it to go away but I guess my point is the alternative is so shrouded in uncertainty and is already inevitable. I mean... if nothing else I want to feel like I have a variety of pain in my existence.

Idk dude I just don’t want you to completely mistrust your body because in my experience that makes living even harder, if you have to live. Generally your body DOES have some points to feeling what it feels, even if it’s overly exaggerated in the name of protection or whatever it thinks it’s doing. So don’t beat yourself up over that stuff I guess. It doesn’t help when parents do that shit to their children and so I guess try not to do that to yourself. Yes, maybe that cowardice is really preventing you from a true escape that’s right at your fingertips, but it’s not going anywhere, it’ll be even more of a relief when it does happen, and even if it goes wrong you’re not completely fucked.

depression,f6l51vm,t3_drs3kh,1572929198.0,"1. While you’re lacking motivation, force yourself to sit at a laptop or notebook (whichever you work better on) and just write whatever vaguely related shit you can think of. Unless it’s a research thing. Then just skim over articles and vaguely summarize them. Put on some music probably.

2. If you are still lacking motivation the day after, do the same thing. Half-heartedly skim through what you wrote and make dumb edits. For me, about halfway I start to actually care but I suppose my depression is also a lot less shitty. Say what you wrote to yourself in your head or out loud sometimes, and if it sounds like dogshit play around with it. Imagine it’s like fumbling around with LEGOs or whatever you did when you were bored as a kid. Use a Thesaurus and then check any words you think you’ve seen before in a Dictionary to see if it will work. That way it feels a little more stable than just stream of consciousness.

3. If you think your lack of motivation or anything else is so severe that it’s impeding your ability to recognize if your paper is passable or not: bring up the rubric and just flip back to it a few times. Be like “oh yeah sure that’s fine” for every category if you can at least vaguely justify that you accomplished it. Then try to get a friend or (preferably) classmate or someone to look at it, unless it is EXPLICITLY AGAINST THE RULES and WILL COMPROMISE YOUR PAPER. Generally it’s easy to stereotype people to figure out which classmate is likely to care and not try to plagiarize or some dogshit like that. If it’s a classmate they likely will want to look at it just because they want to compare it to what they’re doing. 

Worst case scenario: explain the situation to your professor/school and see if you can get a medical extension.

Sometimes doing a quick break for a shower or some funny YouTube video or responding to some Reddit post can help, once in a while. Just limit yourself very clearly and then get back to working. Do not fear the boredom. If you fear the boredom and try to do something you’re interested in it’s just gonna put things off. And in my experience do not sleep. Sleeping fucks my brain even more.

I am not a psychologist or anything. I’m just trying to explain vaguely what works for me. Best of luck. I hate doing shitty papers I feel unprepared for too.

I am proud that I can get myself into slightly better situations. I am proud whenever I put myself out into the world, even when it turns out rather poorly. It’s basically like giving yourself the angel-on-the-shoulder to balance out the devil-on-the-shoulder imo. You need it because it’s unrealistic to solely depend on the latter, and I guess I managed to convince myself self-love is good because I value realism anyways.

I can’t tell you how often people recently just assume I don’t love myself when I say I’m unhappy. It’s very absurd."
depression,f6l3fu0,t3_drsfzy,1572927832.0,"I have no clue why people cry, partially because I find it difficult to cry myself. I tear up sometimes, and maybe once or twice within the last decade I’ve really broken down: the major one was when my mom was at her lowest point and I was worried about her. It felt so weird... like... I guess I had no idea I cared that much about her.

I have no idea if it’s more subconscious. That said... loneliness definitely sucks. I feel like my loneliness personally sucks away at all my potential tears, so I never really cry, just stare blankly with a frown pulling down on my face at things.

I’ve definitely heard of people crying at weird times. So I mean.... you’re not a complete weirdo. Or well... you have weirdo company. Idk if that helps at all. I know I wish I was less weird and could just... fit in with “normal” people.

I don’t know if you feel like you’re grasping for a reason to attach to your crying or if you really do recognize the reason for your sadness. If the former, I mean... there’s a lot to be sad about I think. So don’t feel guilty about it. Keep trying what you can, but know that the hopelessness is definitely... a valid way to view things (I don’t know how much I’m projecting here). Either way... take care of yourself dude.

I don’t know how I can help, if there’s anything I can do, but I mean... if you think of something just hmu on DMs or something."
depression,f6l2r2b,t3_dro7jc,1572927259.0,"Idk if it’s they don’t see you as a person. It’s pretty much just they see you as a stranger. And I mean... I have no clue how to get close to anyone. I really do want to get close to someone out there, but really almost nothing works. I really think it’s astounding how people can have people so close they can physically be so close to. It seems like a dream sometimes."
depression,f6l2d6r,t3_drkaj5,1572926943.0,"I think the worst part is not knowing. I mean apparently “most” people get a light. But it’s really hard to think that that person could be me, since my life is such a garbage fire. And I don’t even really have like... economic shit burdening me yet. Sometimes I feel like I don’t even deserve to feel so out of hope.

If there’s no light I guess it’s about trying to imagine the darkness you’ve lived your whole life in as having some light in places. Or idk overall not being... total darkness. Really garbage way to live, I’d be the first to say, but... I don’t know what else to do. Because it’s either this or I give up and submit to the thing I know is total darkness. And I mean... I’ll eventually get there anyways so I’m not in any hurry."
depression,f6l22lg,t3_drsj4o,1572926713.0,"I don’t know how old you are, but I set my “date” a little over a decade down the line so I get a “chance” to live a decent life. But then again I guess we always have that chance. Idk I figure if I become an adult and nothing changes there’s pretty much no chance anything will end up changing."
depression,f6l1vzd,t3_drlvfj,1572926572.0,"I feel like the only things I’m good at, the things everyone points out to me when I say I feel worthless, are things I have absolutely zero care in the world for. Like I have zero care about my grades in lame classes being good if I have no way of getting a career or having a close relationship with anyone or creating some piece of art that expresses how I feel. Like that relationship thing hurts the worst. It really feels like I’m destined to be lonely forever, even if people are nice enough to be my friend, because I’m just not that kind of person for anyone to feel close to. I can’t even fix the patterns I have that constantly make dumb mistakes. I’m just a nuisance people put up with because I’m not terrible enough for people to hate. I’d be surprised if there was anything interesting anyone had to say about me."

If you really think there’s nothing wrong with what’s happening, grow the fuck up and actually address what the criticisms are with refutations - contributing to an actual discussion - instead of vomiting fallacies onto everything."

Rainbow6,f4nieeo,t1_f4m4d7k,1571689748.0,"That’s a really shitty thing to do on their part, but yeah even though I hate that you’re getting so severely downvoted it is true that you have to learn to get through it. There are absolutely times in the past I’ve gotten pissed to shit and retaliated with some toxic shit. It absolutely sucks if you get banned because of that. But the only way to make progress is to be better than that. Laugh it off. If I realize my teammates are toxic trash, I stop trying so hard that game. Put on some music, spam lean and dance around, etc. That toxicity ends up ruining more of your games and probably gets you put on offense lists way more than those assholes will ever get.

Best of luck man. It really sucks solo queuing. Vent to someone close to you. I believe you’re strong enough to withstand those juvenile insults and shit."
