Yeah Marie has mental health issues. Kleptomania. That doesn't excuse it, but it explains it. But she's working on herself. Hank treats her like shit whe he's bedbound so she relapses. So of couse he forgives her.

She wanted to save the baby from living in a house with a VIOLENT criminal, knowing that not so long ago the mother of the baby wanted the same thing. Totally understandable, I think I would have tried the same thing. But she stopped herself. It was  Walt who actually kidnapped the baby.

Breaking bad felt a little bit like a chore to watch in the first seasons, but i fell in love with the cinematography. And I think in season 3 tensions rise and it becomes so gripping.
But i just didn't like walther at all, right from the start.

AskReddit,fgxtp4u,t3_f0hzfu,1581176509.0,"First of  being creepy is something women are also being capable of

\- not understanding personal space

\- staring

\- not understanding that there's a time and place to approach someone romantically. Asking for phone number/date and making compliments is okay in some settings, but not in others. When a woman(or man) is in an situation where they are forced to interact with you and can't leave the situation easily, that's not a good place. This can mean job settings, (don't flirt with your waiter/waitress, when they aren't done serving you, for example) Don't flirt with the person who is sitting next to you on the bus and can't leave easily

\- if you decide to approach a person who doesn't know you, you have to understand that it's completely normal for some people to not like being approached by strangers. It's their right to say ""I'm not interested."". It's even their right to not even interact with you.

\- which leads to another important point:

\-not taking no for an answer is another creepy thing. I don't care what pick-up artists or people who claim to understand the ""female psyche"" like stefan molyneux have told you: Women have their own minds, women are able to make their own decisions, WOMEN KNOW WHAT THEY WANT; AND WHEN THEY SAY NO IT MEANS NO !!!
