science,fpslmho,t1_fpsk2x1,1588875549.0,"It's good that you're doing well, but your experience isn't automatically everyone else's. They might not meet the requirements. Maybe they don't have a high school or college degree, invalidating a not insignificant amount of jobs for them. Perhaps they may lack transportation to get to different (potentially higher paying) jobs. The fact of the matter is that in a lot of minimum wage, or close to it, jobs, you don't really have a leg to stand on when asking for a raise. A lot of places I've worked in the past have explicitly had a policy where they don't give raises.

I'm unsure if you're in the US, but at least here there is another major problem with this. There's a kind of limbo with Medicaid. While receiving this aid, you may get a better job offer. Great, so you take it. Only now you don't qualify for Medicaid, but your new job still can't fully support you. While it's better than nothing, the system is incredibly flawed.

There's a plethora of reasons people get stuck in low paying jobs. Again, it's great that you didn't, but A LOT of people have these issues, and frankly I don't see your bootstraps approach as being very reasonable."

Therapy would be a great start and definite progress, but I know that personally I'm a wreck without my meds. Just something to keep in mind. Plus I want to echo the idea of accountability. I get it, she got dealt a bad hand, but that doesn't circumvent personal responsibility. If she doesn't have a real willingness to change, then this relationship simply isn't sustainable.

There's something to be said for marijuana certainly, although people's reactions are so wildly different it can potentially be extremely negative for someone with bipolar. Hopefully research will continue, so that it can eventually be used as a prescribed medication (specifically for mental health).

And yes, unfortunately a lot of meds, especially antipsychotics, strip away a lot of feelings. For some, it is worth the tradeoff. Obviously, a positive attitude is great thing to have, but I think it's kind of a dangerous approach to say that it's a cure in its own right. Like I said, it is obviously extremely beneficial, but I feel like that mindset can lead to the outsider's view that people who are depressed simply need to stop being sad. I'm sure you don't mean it in that sense. I figured I'd just put my two cents in about that.

Hopefully it won't come to that for you, but it may become necessary at some point, and there's no shame in that. If you feel you are close to the edge, there might not be any better options. I wish you didn't have to go through this, but I promise it will pass in time."
bipolar,eup9f56,t3_ch30ab,1563953539.0,"Just had this for the past day or two. Absolutely felt like I was just going to jump out of my skin. Work was fun. Gotta love it. Hang in there, friend. 🤙"
bipolar,euodujh,t1_eu8sgfp,1563940485.0,"Sorry, I somehow missed this reply! It's great to hear that your appointment was moved up I hope everything went well. And yes, it'll pass. It's hard to really truly believe that sometimes, but you'll get there. I know how fine the line between emerging from a depressive episode and mania is. Hopefully this won't be the case. Regardless, try not to worry about it for now. One step at a time is often the only thing we can do."
bipolar,euod627,t1_eukfae8,1563940241.0,"I'm sorry to hear that. My family has been overwhelmingly supportive, and I'm not sure what I would do without that. I don't know if you can change his mind, but I hope in time he can work to change himself. Are there any other support systems you have access to?"
bipolar,eujbive,t3_cgnenw,1563867362.0,"Can I ask how old you are? If I remember correctly, most severe mental illnesses manifest in full in the 20s. Of course, that's not always the case, but maybe that explains the onset for you. In all honesty, it might be impossible to know for sure.

Either way, you can get through this. Plenty of people with schizoaffective features live otherwise normal lives. Personally, I've never suffered from any hallucinations, but I know many people who do. Firstly, finding the right medication(s) is going to be important for managing your conditions. Additionally, your doctors or therapists will probably instruct you to do 'reality checks'. Basically, stopping to assess what's actually happening versus what you're experiencing. Perhaps people who know more can add onto this. Mostly I just wanted to post and let you know that you're going to be alright. You CAN get through this. This community, of course, will always be here for you as well. I'm sorry this is happening, but you're going to be ok. Feel free to reach out if you need anything. All the best to you."
bipolar,eujarx3,t3_cgovw4,1563866832.0,"Well this is encouraging.

In all seriousness, mental health awareness is getting better and better, but there's a looooong way to go. This statistic is sad, but I can't say I'm surprised. I've had it ingrained in my mind for years that I'll end up a part of it. Made it this far though. Hang in there, friends."
bipolar,eujafz4,t3_cgnt96,1563866602.0,"I often have that feeling you've described. It's rough. And I also have experienced the sort of shame and guilt you describe in terms of your mental health negatively affecting relationships, both familial and romantic. Just understand that your feelings are valid. You have an illness. Your instability is a product of that, and it sucks that it affects the people around you. Obviously you want to lessen that as much as possible, but sometimes it can't be helped. Internalizing your emotions is one of the last things you want to do. Try to let go of that guilt.

As for school, I personally had to withdraw partway through a semester. I went back home and went to school locally. Maybe you need to take off? If not, maybe look at community colleges or closer universities. Living at home may not be bad for you at the moment. Additionally, it sounds like you've found medical professionals who are really helping you. At the end of the day, your health should come first. Personally, I had trouble dealing with leaving school for awhile. It felt like a personal failure, and it seemed as though my future was ruined, I was falling behind, and so on. But frankly you don't have to live your life on anyone else's schedule. Take your time. Take care of yourself. I wish I had a way to just solve this for you, but ultimately you have to figure out what's best for you. This is all temporary. It will pass. That's hard to remember, but it's important to keep in mind. If you ever need to reach out, don't hesitate! Take care of yourself."
bipolar,eui5hj4,t3_cgecmg,1563840803.0,"I've been through something similar. Like you, it only affected my personal life, but it seems as if yours is quite a bit more severe. Honestly, besides minimizing situations that are likely going to send you over the edge (unfortunately, I realize that is nearly everything at the moment). This will pass eventually. Sometimes it's a matter of riding it out while doing the least damage possible.

Try anything you can. Breathing patterns helped me quite a bit. Regular exercise seemed to help as well. Good way to tire yourself out and blow off some steam. If you truly feel you are going to hurt someone (or yourself) going to the hospital might be the best option. Take care of yourself."
bipolar,eui3cfe,t3_cghps8,1563839560.0,"This feeling is the worst. What's even worse is that it always seems to come true. Maybe it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. I can't say I have much advice for you, as this is a problem I face myself. However, mostly I would recommend trying to establish good habits and solid coping skills while you are feeling fine. Now, some of these are bound to fall apart in the event of depression or (hypo)mania, but if any of it sticks, well, that's better than nothing. If you still have access to medical providers or have a way to get in touch with some, perhaps try to work alongside them and coordinate with them. In the event of an episode, remember that it will pass in time. At that point try to maintain those coping skills and habits, so that you can hopefully minimize any self-destruction. Wishing you the best, friend."
bipolar,eui1hsk,t1_eui0hzz,1563838460.0,"Ok, no worries. If you need anything, this place is super supportive. Just shoot if you have any questions. It really isn't a bother."
bipolar,eui0w0l,t3_cgjtbj,1563838106.0,"This is completely symptomatic of the disease. I totally understand your worry and anxiety (gone cold turkey before, obviously with no medical advice), but you'd be doing the right thing by addressing this with your doctors. This does NOT make you a lost cause. In fact, I imagine stuff like this is actually pretty commo. It's their collective jobs to deal with things like these, and most likely they're personally invested as well. I do not think they will give up on you."
bipolar,eui01au,t3_cgk0iu,1563837603.0,"First thing's first: no one here can diagnose you, nor should they try. That is strictly for a medical professional to do. That being said, what kind of questions do you have? I can try my best to answer them, and I'm sure others are willing to as well."
bipolar,euboq5g,t3_cfoax3,1563653208.0,"I can relate to this a whole lot. Gotta play with the hand you're dealt. Sometimes you want to fold, but you may as well see it through."

bipolar,eu8n6es,t1_eu74cae,1563560399.0,"Huh, I had that wrong then. Yeah, that's pretty problematic. There might be something to be said for it revealing an underlying disorder in some cases, but these are powerful drugs. It really isn't a stretch to consider that their discontinuation could be the sole cause of a manic episode in someone who otherwise has no symptoms of bipolarity."
bipolar,eu72f3e,t1_eu720xc,1563515796.0,"It's hard to say for certain, but I would say that's one of the first times I can point at and say, yeah, that was definitely hypomania. This did not lead to my bipolar diagnosis, as I wasn't as familiar with it at the time. Though I did always suspect it, to a degree. My official diagnosis didn't happen until roughly a year and a half later when I was hospitalized. I pretty much was convinced I was on the bipolar spectrum somewhere, so I worked with doctors, suggested that, and they agreed after a lot of psychological questionnaires and some interview sort of things. I suffer far more from depressive episodes than manic phases. Additionally, I was diagnosed Bipolar II, as nothing I've experienced amounts to true mania (psychosis, extreme delusions, etc.).

Editing just to say that I'm fairly sure that the DSM V excludes (hypo)manic episodes if they are drug related, which, I assume, includes coming off of antidepressants. Thus, I don't think that those experiences would have contributed to a diagnosis anyways."
bipolar,eu71yim,t1_eu6zxme,1563515376.0,"Yeah, it doesn't surprise me to hear that long term use can lead to physiological changes and increased risk. And yes, from my experience and others' anecdotes it seems far more common to experience increased depressive symptoms from discontinuation of antidepressants. There certainly is something to be said for the danger of these types of medications, but, at least for me, they are essential. Unfortunately, as it seems you know well, current antidepressants are typically quite invasive and often even ineffective in many ways. If it works, it works, but it's funny to me that we have such a limited grasp of how they fundamentally function from a pharmacology standpoint. However, newer and less widespread treatments are seemingly quite effective. For example, TMS, ECT, ketamine infusion therapy, and esketamine have been shown to be useful for many people. As far as I've heard, the most common and detrimental (for lack of a better word) side effect is short term memory issues. Now, that isn't ideal, but it certainly seems like an improvement to me. Though I do believe there's some hesitation among medical professionals in regards to using some of these treatments for bipolar depression. Hopefully treatments like these continue to improve and work to alleviate some of these nasty side effects. Anyways, I hope that things go well for you, and that you find what you need, medication or no."
bipolar,eu6xtl2,t3_cf2bi5,1563511869.0,"Before I was diagnosed with BP, I went through a whooole lot of antidepressants, and going off of them sometimes had this kind of effect on me. I went cold turkey off of Zoloft and Wellbutrin at one point, and I would definitely describe the experience as similar to hypomania. I honestly don't remember much of this period, even though it was all that long ago. As an aside, I've felt what I suppose could be described as hypomanic symptoms from normally tapering off of antidepressants as well."
bipolar,eu6x76u,t3_ceyfdp,1563511375.0,"I'm sorry you're going through this. The medical system in America is often disappointing. Is it possible to reach out to anyone about trying to move your appointment up? Perhaps try to reach your care coordinator in the absence of your case manager (if you haven't already). Even if you have, keep calling if you feel up to it. Sounds like you could use help, and they're the ones who are supposed to be helping you. Try to work through the negative feelings regarding disability. It doesn't make you inferior to anyone. You have an illness, and there's no shame in that.

As for appearing normal, try not to worry about it. Obviously, it's not a bad thing to look presentable and function well at work, but it's not your problem what people think of you. If they're judging you for being sick, that's on them. Not you. Try your best; that's all you can do. If you don't feel up to showering, maybe just put on some fresh clothes. If you don't feel capable of preparing food, eat something ready made. Not able to get out of bed and do anything? Try, just for a little bit, to walk around the house. Something is better than nothing, no matter how small. It's one step at a time. Take it moment by moment, day by day. There is no timeline for your recovery. Let go of those expectations. You've got this, friend."
bipolar,eu6w9vh,t3_ceyxnx,1563510655.0,"As others have said, it's likely the Effexor. However, it sometimes happens to me for seemingly no reason. Like, without missing a dose or anything. I've had them on other antidepressants as well. Probably just another fun little side effect."
bipolar,eu6vxze,t3_ceup83,1563510408.0,"Wow, I actually teared up a little bit when first looking at this.

This is honestly beautiful."
bipolar,eu6vig5,t3_cew6l7,1563510077.0,"One of the few positive parts of bipolarity is the creative aspect. Do you write outside of episodes? If this is any indication, you seem to be a talented writer. And needless to say, I hope you're doing better now."
bipolar,eu6usv7,t3_cezocf,1563509554.0,"I'm currently on Venlafaxine, but along with Lamotrigine (mood stabilizer). Being prescribed only Effexor seems questionable. There's plenty of evidence to support the potential dangers of taking typical antidepressants without a mood stabilizer, antipsychotic, etc. when bipolar is present. Was this a primary care doctor or a psychiatrist? If it was a regular doc, consider seeing a psych. Either way, especially since it sounds like (hypo)mania is an issue for you, this does not seem like a good idea to me. Not a medical professional, but that's my input. A second opinion may be in order."
bipolar,etwbczd,t3_cdhycj,1563261758.0,"Finding the right meds can be frustrating and disheartening. The side effects can be horrible. Overall they're not fun, but I don't think I'd be here without them. I get people's hesitation towards taking them, and if not taking them works out, then good for them. Actively encouraging people to not get medicated, however, is dangerous and irresponsible."
bipolar,etwb7gv,t1_etvza7x,1563261552.0,"I've definitely hesitated to go to appointments or be totally truthful at risk of returning to the hospital, but at the end of the day it'll probably be a lot better to continue seeing your psych and counselor. Also definitely apologize, but I imagine it's nothing too unusual for them in their line of work."
bipolar,etwax1z,t3_cds2s1,1563261166.0,"I have had this exact feeling almost all the time for years. Imagining the future, especially long term, is hard--almost impossible even. I've been slipping back into a fairly severe depression lately, but even when I'm relatively stable, the feeling is still there. At this point, I don't even know if I believe it, or if it's just ingrained within me. The nature of this disease is so cyclical. It comes and goes in varying degrees. The inevitability of it all is what gets me. You can be doing well, improving even, or at least not doing terrible, and then suddenly you have an episode. Everything comes crashing down again. On a slightly more optimistic note (if you can call it that), on New Year's of 2018, I kept thinking to myself, 'This is it. This is the year. I'm not going to make it to 2019.' There was a fun little hospital stay in there somewhere, but I proved myself wrong then, and I intend to continue trying to do that. It's one step at a time for now. Anyway, this turned out longer than I meant for it to be. In the end, I can relate to how you feel. You're not alone in this, and, if you ever need someone to talk to, I'm available. Well wishes, friend."
