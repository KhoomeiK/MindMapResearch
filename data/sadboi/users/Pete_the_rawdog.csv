TrueOffMyChest,fn6vml9,t1_fn6sztk,1586708230.0,"So, you say their suffering outweighs the suicidal persons?  

People dont often kill themselves just because they are sad one day.  It is an ongoing struggle that involves DAILY emotional/physical pain.  If i truly knew someone I loved was suffering the way I do....i would miss them if they killed themself....but i would understand and hope they found the peace they were desperately seeking.  

I have actually discussed my suicidal thoughts with my family and they accept it.   They aren't happy about it-however they do understand.  Plus I'm not actively suicidal so there is nothing they can really do about it.  But, they have seen me suffer and struggle with different meds/therapy and NOTHING works long term for my issues.  They can see how long I have been fighting and how absolutely exhausting it has been for me.  I am in my 30s and have had these issues as long as i can remember....a 4 year old shouldn't hide away somewhere crying and convincing themself their mother doesnt love them and they should die.  I did.

My mom is my biggest supporter, always has been and i love her to death.  But, I think my brain was just broken from birth."

You have contributed nothing to this conversation but to say ""NUH UH"" or just being condescending.   If you don't want to discuss these aspects seriously then GTFO, man.  

Now that it has been explained to you why the mail could be relevant you become sarcastic because your brain can't comprehend that sometimes things aren't straightforward.

So there being mail in the box still would show that she was in a hurry and didn't check the mail so she could hitch the ride.   It logically makes sense going along with the most popular theory.   So, it is a good question."

I agree with the other poster that I would think something dull but with an edge.  Like a claw hammer.  Though the pics do make it hard to differentiate what are wounds/bruises/shadows etc.   It looks like something that would be easy to smack someone with but not sharp enough to make proper cuts."

If they checked the mailbox AFTER Katherine was dead and found mail in the box, it would mean she NEVER MADE IT TO THE BOX.  Lending credence to the theory that she hitched a ride on the back of mom's car.

If there was no mail, then maybe they didn't get mail or maybe it blew off....

The point the poster is trying to convey is ""IF THE MAILBOX WAS CHECKED AFTER SHE WAS DEAD AND THERE WAS MAIL IN IT, then Katherine DIDNT MAKE IT TO THE MAILBOX.


Jesus Christ.

insaneparents,fmzpfq5,t1_fmzo10z,1586526681.0,">Then again, you never know where life leads


I hate this mentality when it comes to having kids.  I make a conscious choice to ignore my biological clock because I decided I don't want children.  If my BC failed, and I got pregnant I would ABSOLUTELY have an abortion.  No doubt in my mind.  



You never know where life leads, but that statement should have ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with bringing a LIFE into this world.   Makes it seem like having kids is just some willy-nilly thing that whoopsey happened and now you must ""suffer the consequences"".  Nobody should have kids unless they 1000000% are sure they want them.    A child should only be brought into a safe world with a loving family that wants them."
