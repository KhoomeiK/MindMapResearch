ValorantCompetitive,fr57734,t3_gmmy2t,1589903701.0,"1.) Use it to stop pushes.
For example if you are holding A on Haven and you hear the boys coming long fast shoot 2 shock darts with 1 charge 1 bounce off the left wall , it can do a lot of damage. Ive gotten a 300 damage drop once.

2.) Retakes. When retaking B on Haven  clear a couple of angles then you can memorize or freestyle some shock darts for backsite and default.

Just some examples. The only cheese shock darts I do at the start of the round is the popular one for uhall on bind attack."

ValorantCompetitive,fr00t8g,t1_fr00ot8,1589780462.0,"Lol the actual time is 35 min, do you not play a single game? I also sometimes space it out like doing kovaak way before range."
ValorantCompetitive,fqzhkgy,t1_fqzh9x5,1589767528.0,"Yeah thats with breaks and stuff. Its usually 20 min kovaaks without breaks and 15 in the practice range. So 35 min total of actual practice. 

I havent taken CS seriously in a while and there isnt a deathmatch yet so this is my routine for now."
ValorantCompetitive,fqzg6nd,t1_fqzf48w,1589766685.0,"I'd make another thread for that for some higher level players to answer. I'm only plat 1 right now so I'm not great player or anything but here is my personal routine:

1.) I have a Kovaaks playlist that I run through (Kovaaks is a steam game that is a fps aim trainer, look up the popular ones people use for Valorant) and the playlist usually takes me about 10 min to do. After that I stretch my wrist and arm a bit and take a 10 min rest then I'll do it one more time, stretch my wrist / arm again. This is just to warm up your mouse movement a bit. (30 min total)

2.) Then I hop into practice range and do a round on easy with armor with only sherrif until I get at least 25 (usually takes 1 attempt, 3 attempts max)

3.) Do Medium w/ armor  Vandal and get at least a 25 (2 attempts usually)

4.) Use Marshall on Medium w/armor and get at least a 20 since I use it a lot on anti ecos and help practice flicks to the head and just to practice scoped sensitivity flicks since I also use the Operator (1 attempt usually)

5.) Do Hard w/ armor Vandal get at least 15 but I'll do 3 runs minimum

6.) Finally I'll do 1 or 2 runs of the 50 elimination bots with armor and strafe on (usually 70 seconds per attempt)

I usually allocate a total of an hour before I play to warm up with the break but it usually doesn't take me that long. Just make sure to take breaks and stretch your wrist. If it takes me 45 min to finish that warmup I'll just stretch / rest for another 15.

Sometimes I'll do the Kovaaks a lot earlier then go to practice range later for 15 min or so, just depends on how my aim is that day really."
ValorantCompetitive,fqz6j19,t3_glq87l,1589760912.0,"I wouldnt worry a ton about the hard mode score. I average about 15 on hard with armor and im currently plat 1. tbh a lot of it can be luck if they spawn close to you so you dont have to flick a ton.

In most games you dont need to hit super quick flicks like that with crosshair placement.

I think if you can get at least 27/28 on easy, 25+ on medium and between 15-20 on hard your aim will be alright until the higher ranks."

VALORANT,fousrfs,t1_foursov,1588089789.0,"Lets say you are playing Haven pushing A. Jett can throw a smoke heaven, curve a smoke on site, throw a smoke firebox then dash into her smoke. The enemy team knows Jett is on site and has to watch for her. Your teammates also push on to site while you start aggresively peeking.

No other agent can really do this. It requires a lot of teamwork and has some counterplay (Cypher) but just an example."
VALORANT,fourkoo,t3_g9p04i,1588089227.0,"One thing people never realize on Jett is that you have no ""setup"" time on your smokes. Brim has to stand there and mark them on map, Omen has to do his weird right click to get it deep and point up for higher ground. Jett just yeets and curves it on the fly, it can be very useful for immediate cover and helps her and the team get in. She also has good eco utility that gets overlooked.

Yeah typically if you arent going to AWP you shouldnt play Jett but she does have some uses and some utility, far from a selfish pick."
