Cleaning his apartment is an obligation, it has to be done some time or later. He could postpone it a few weeks, but it has to be done at some point. Maybe he thinks the task is too daunting so that he doesn't have time for it in the week. Maybe he wants to do it alone because he doesn't feel you can realistically offer much help. I also got into trouble with my ex gf because I wanted to do stuff alone. Some things are just more efficient if you do them alone, or you would get in each other's way. 

I always experienced my ex gf as extremely clingy, super dependant, always upset about nothing. ""Feels like I have 2 children"" (in stead of 1). All this hassle just tired me even more.

My brother applied for my unemployment benefit. After my contract ended I almost immediately left the country for 3 months to travel. My employer needed a few more days to set up the paperwork with which I could apply for an unemployment benefit, so I sent my brother to the labour union's office in my stead. 

My brother's driver license did not allow him to drive my scooter. Some laws changed, my brother and I did the same driving exam, but because I managed to get my license before this law came into effect, I was allowed to drive a scooter and he was not. Whenever he used my scooter we would switch driver licenses. He has now taken motor bike lessons, so we don't do that anymore. We agreed that if he ever got in a crash with my license, he could fill out insurance forms with my name. We assumed that crashing without a license would get him in bigger trouble than whatever financial hit I would take from taking the crash on me. 

These are not really good pranks, like the OP asked, but I know a good one from a colleague of my brother. At his job, there used to work a guy who also had a twin brother. The brother was unemployed and had a descent unemployment benefit, so they agreed that they would both work the same job, but simply switch every other day.

DebateReligion,fbguavx,t3_edb19y,1576858750.0,"There are muslims who disregard the hadith sources entirely, so if you want to become a Quranist, point 2 is solved very easily. 

But apart from that. Most muslims have this idea that everything Muhammad said is something that should automatically be implemented in a ruling, and can not be deviated from. Historically this was not always the approach. Early muslim scholars can be quoted saying ""we accept the authenticity of this hadith, but we will not act upon it""

There are also hadith were muslims say they won't be able to perform a religious obligation properly, and Muhammad simply gives a concession. (Muhammad told someone he was allowed to pray Fajr whenever he woke up, even though muslims nowadays calculate the permissible time slot exactly up to the minute)
Also hadith were Muhammad said he should be followed on the things he says regarding religion, but everything else is his own opinion, and people might know better than him.

With this in mind, you might also tone down the importance of hadith authenticity. 

Anyway as you said, I always welcome fruitful discussion, so I will not go too deep in this point. But don't convert to Islam, it will make you very happy, give a big boost to your life in the short run. But the mainstream idea that every hadith is a valid ruling, which you as a convert have to follow, is very hard to resist, and has the potential to make your life miserable."

I guess you to will be going through a difficult period mentally, but it will pass.

I am pretty certain he quoted some of what u/Blackack_ has posted. Especially this one, Hassan Radwan emphasized the reference to ""not a ball like astronomers claim"". لا كرّة 

And at the earth – how it is spread out? (88:20)’ meaning it was laid flat, and from that the power of Allah is inferred. This was linked to camels (in 88:17) because they are the animal most connected to Earth. And His usage of the ‘spread out’ literally suggests that the Earth is flat, and such is the opinion of the scholars of Islam, not a ball like astronomers claim, though claiming so is not a grave sin.”
