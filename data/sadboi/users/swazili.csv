The walking around gives you a change of scenery, the water provides a physical sensation you are firmiliar with that distracts you, stretching intensely and really getting some good bloodflow can help make you a lot more relaxed, and finally the youtube will distract you and put you to sleep, just dont click next video!!!

My girlfriend doesnt like to talk about her deep emotions very much, so i too get worried that I am the cause when she gets anxious or uncomfortable or things get a little weird.


We both just need to really remember that we have a physiological issue in our brains and that when we have these thoughts, they can quickly go from a silly notion to reality. Just try and remember that you and I are likely often over analyzing things and that is through no fault of your own,

If this does continue though I would suggest calmly explaining why when she does this it makes you feel uncomfortable, and makes you turn on yourself and worry for her. She should understand.
