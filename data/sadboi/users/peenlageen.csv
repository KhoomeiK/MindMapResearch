That’s basically all I’m eating right now though: chicken, brown rice, and broccoli. Oats and eggs in the morning with some whey throughout the day. Lots and lots of that stuff. Thanks for the reply."

AskReddit,fhgotsv,t1_fhfwwfu,1581573491.0,Hahaha you’re totally right. There’s nothing placebo about Xanax. Take too much and you won’t remember the last few days. It’s not fun or satisfying and really freakin scary not knowing anything you did the last couple days. I know so many people that take tons of Xanax every day (not prescribed and they don’t take it for anxiety) and I just don’t understand how somebody could live that way. It’s not fun being a zombie. But if it helps people at a low dose than that’s great👍🏽
Anxiety,fhg259n,t3_f31qmf,1581556823.0,Good for you👍🏽what ways did you learn to deal with them?
