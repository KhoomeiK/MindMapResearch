BipolarReddit,fpfl9mp,t1_fp5k93t,1588574763.0,"I’m no doctor or an expert but this is what i believe happens. SSRIs are used to block excessive serotonin. Something about being bipolar causes your brain chemistry to work in waves and not a steady flow and SSRIs sometimes block the serotonin that you probably need at times. It causes a lot of predisposed bipolar people to experience their first manic episode almost like a catalyst. SSRIs = bad, mood stabilizers and antipsychotics = good

Edit: sorry for the late response friend"
BipolarReddit,fp5huhi,t3_gbf8w7,1588329935.0,Watch your moods carefully. Many (including myself) have had bad experiences with bipolar disorder and SSRIs

BipolarReddit,fjg9h3o,t3_fd3ygf,1583318017.0,100%. I always described my mania or hypo mania waves as “adrenaline rushes” where I can physically feel my heart beating faster and my mood elevating.

BipolarReddit,fgrgirk,t1_fgrgcgi,1581046251.0,It’s kind of like an “electrical jolt” that runs thru your brain that may make your vision blur for a second. They’re relatively harmless and somewhat normal every now and then or when focusing on small things or writings. They can be symptoms of an oncoming seizure tho if they happen severely or frequently.
BipolarReddit,fgrckfk,t3_f03r2h,1581043504.0,"I had anxiety my whole life. Even as a child i struggled with it but I thought it was normal because I just didn’t know any better. As I got into my teens I would get crazy mood swings and again just dismissed it as puberty or hormones or whatever. I eventually opened up to my mom about my anxiety issues and my very obvious mood swings. She put me into therapy where my first therapist didn’t think my symptoms were bad enough for medication. I then sought other help because talk therapy surely wasn’t helping enough. I saw my first (and still current) pdoc who prescribed Zoloft and I went haywire and had my first manic episode. I hear that’s common too, where the first manic episode comes out because of an SSRI. I then tried different antipsychotics, with tons of trial and error until I finally calmed down from a combination that helped."
BipolarReddit,fgrbhfn,t3_f0384j,1581042770.0,"I was on this exact combo for a while a couple years ago. I thought it was great at first with all the energy it gave me, but be weary because Wellbutrin can lower seizure threshold in some patients. I ended up have a big seizure and was immediately taken off of Wellbutrin. If you start getting brain zaps, tell your doctor IMMEDIATELY."
BipolarReddit,f86yr8w,t1_f86y2ja,1574310429.0,"Ive never had a problem, and I’ve gotten plenty of call backs. In fact I most recently got hired at a place where I put I had a disability on the resume. I’ve never had a problem with it. I did it in college too and I ever got a “special” counselor. she was different different than a normal counselor since she helped with classes and reaching out to professors and things. To me, it just made sense when I filed for FMLA with work with my previous jobs employers if they knew I already said I had a disability beforehand."

bipolar,f86xpvg,t1_f86kwhp,1574309602.0,Im not even sure how to register for state disability. Could they help even with brand names prescriptions? How much would apply do? What does it really entail?
bipolar,f86xn1q,t1_f86o06h,1574309543.0,"I live in Ohio. My moms insurance covers part of the other two, but not vraylar, and I’m still on her plan as well. Sorry should’ve added that. My boyfriend gave me a medication assistance packet to take to my doctor. I’ve also never applied for FMLA
but never state disability....I think."

BipolarReddit,f80qy3d,t3_dyd4dn,1574135879.0,I do. It makes more sense to me to do that in case I need to file FMLA again or anything like that. Millions of people have disabilities and still work and function properly. Just because mine is mental doesn’t make it any different. I guess I use it as a “heads up guys”
bipolar,f80ckpb,t1_f80cbof,1574125785.0,I take 300 mg three times a day originally to calm little panic attacks that I’d call ”adrenaline rushes” (they were basically random heart palpitations and racing thoughts) 300 is a low(er) dose but it definitely has made me feel more stable and calm. I take it with CBD sometimes too and it’s super calming and mind clearing! I also take 100 mg of seroquel. Originally it was for sleep but now I feel the dose actually helps with something at least. Hope this helps!
bipolar,f80bwxo,t1_f802g4m,1574125315.0,Vraylar did wonders for me. That and Gabapentin. Hope it works for you too!

bipolar,exk87sl,t3_ctczhw,1566378155.0,Nostalgia  and flashbacks can overwhelm me too sometimes!! I try and channel the thoughts into positive thoughts and more reminiscing as opposed to getting worked up and sad that I can't go back.
