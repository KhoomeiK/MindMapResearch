My fianc√© works from home now too and she agreed to wear soundproof headphones or go out side while I‚Äôm having my session, I‚Äôve found being in my room and making it feel like my therapists office helps. I set my computer on a chair at the same distance I would be at therapy. Obviously it‚Äôs not the same and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get to a point where I‚Äôm as comfortable as I am in actual therapy but it helps. Hope any of that is possible/useful for you!"

ptsd,fk4pswg,t3_fgcgki,1583865222.0,I feel it. I often take extra medication so I sleep longer or earlier. The way I see it either I have a beautiful dream and truck myself into some temporary joy or I have a nightmare and life seems better by comparison when I wake up.
ptsd,fjpu3tv,t3_feq6th,1583560869.0,"I don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs more under control, but me understanding why it‚Äôs there has helped a lot. Basically a lot of therapy lol"

vinyl,fi4qz0h,t3_f6h7ls,1582146702.0,"You should read up on the issues with majors moving to a distributer called direct shot. I work at an indie store and I can tell you it‚Äôs putting a lot of us in a really hard place, there‚Äôs a couple of really good articles on it. But long version short basically thousands of orders aren‚Äôt getting delivered to us or they arrive wrong or broken and there‚Äôs no customer service to talk to because direct shot is nowhere near prepared enough to deal with distribution. So now a lot of us are having to go to one stops to get new releases which means paying more on our end. The large labels are bleeding us indie folk alive right now."
vinyl,fi4q3ie,t3_f6hbhp,1582146204.0,"Obviously not an original but this was only 40$ rather than 1500$ haha. I found this yesterday at my local record shop, I didn‚Äôt have much hope because picture discs generally sound terrible and the vinyl itself was pretty flimsy and it‚Äôs a bootleg so... But I was pleasantly surprised it‚Äôs more than bearable! And I just love Joy Division so much I couldn‚Äôt pass up on it. 

Y‚Äôall find anything cool lately?"
UnresolvedMysteries,fhza3ba,t1_fhz8j7v,1581994358.0,It‚Äôs so tragic. What really gets me too is the fact he hit his kids with a hatchet Before blowing up the house. For someone who ‚Äúloved‚Äù his kids so much that‚Äôs such a violent and personal way of ending it. The poor sister too. She‚Äôs just been shattered by all of this.

vinyl,fgrn0cc,t3_f05hl4,1581051148.0,"First up is one of the best post punk/hardcore/noise records I‚Äôve ever heard Black Humor: Love god love one another. Originally out in 1982 and only pressed 1000 copies. Each of the covers was hand painted, spray painted, collaged etc. this one if you look closely is a different album they colored over. Super fantastic band wish they had done more but only ever did the one. 

And second is a really awesome folk/psych record by Jimmy Campbell: Half Baked in 1970. He was also in a group called the 23rd turnoff that is killer and a group called the Kirkbys which was part of the early Beatles scene. The a side is pretty straight pop psyche but the b side gets super heavy and groovy. 

Super happy to add both of these to my collection!"

ptsd,fgjtb7a,t3_eyw9pm,1580850981.0,I have a similar problem but reversed. I masturbate a lot almost compulsively but when I tried to have sex it‚Äôs horrible for me.

ptsd,febse5t,t1_febs1f6,1578962170.0,"From what I‚Äôve experienced that‚Äôs all PTSD is, confusion, pain, guilt shame etc. but it gets more manageable as time goes on. I like to think of it as an injury over a disorder. I may have broken my leg but someday I‚Äôll be able to walk, maybe I‚Äôll have a limp or can‚Äôt run as well but the leg isn‚Äôt broken anymore. Just do what you can to get through each day and never give up. There is light at the end of the tunnel"

vinyl,faf338z,t3_e8x0cm,1576013507.0,Recently picked these up on my run to my local shop in Seattle. Sir lord Baltimore and randy Holden are two of the best (in my opinion) proto-metal 70s albums Randy Holden came out right about the same time as the first sabbath album but flew super under the radar. For sure check it out if you dig that sound. Sir lord Baltimore is more of just straight up proto. If you like budgie and other heavy bands like that check it out! I also picked up my favorite funkadelic album as well as my favorite parliament album. If you‚Äôve never listened to either you really should- such an awesome blend of soul funk rock psych etc. and lastly rounded out my killing joke collection- their first album is def my favorite though but the song eighties on nighttime absolutely rips. Did y‚Äôall find anything cool for the holiday season?
ptsd,fa9htap,t3_e815g5,1575874249.0,"I cried for the first time of two years in therapy, and probably first time in more than a decade. Felt embarrassed and shameful but I‚Äôm proud of myself for letting my guard down that much."

Find whatever small comforts you can and use them up."
ptsd,f9x6vyb,t3_e73o2v,1575705780.0,"I think shame is one of the biggest struggles with ptsd. If you can‚Äôt say it try writing it down and have your therapist read it. Your therapist is there to help you, they wouldn‚Äôt talk to you week after week if they didn‚Äôt want to see you get better. It‚Äôs hard to move past the shame but it‚Äôs a necessary step in therapy. 

Trigger warning s/a

I just recently blurted out to my therapist about sexual abuse I went through and all the terrible thoughts I have because of it. I was utterly shamefilled and felt disgraced and dirty and like I should never go back, but he was very sweet and gentle with me and now I feel it‚Äôs something I can talk about little by little. You just gotta start small and work up to it. 

If it helps to tell a stranger first feel free to message me, I don‚Äôt know you at all and can‚Äôt have any sort of opinion about you as a person from it."

It‚Äôs very hard but I‚Äôm still here, I think some day I‚Äôll be at peace with what happened to me but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll ever be gone, and I hope it‚Äôs the same for everyone. I think it‚Äôs kinda silly to think life will ever be normal but I do have the belief that it‚Äôll be easier some day, and I think someday it‚Äôll be easier for you too. You just gotta keep pushing and find someone or somewhere you can speak about what you‚Äôre going through. My dms are always open to you and everyone here."

From what I understand ptsd physically alters your neural pathways, once you start unlocking and talking about stuff you‚Äôll break those pathways and make new ones. Unfortunately with otsd the really only solution is to just work through as awful as that may be. You gotta get worse before you get better. 

I also think it‚Äôs important for your gf to understand truly how you feel. I get in arguments constantly with mine because I don‚Äôt know how to fully articulate how I feel but sometimes even just saying that helps her understand."
ptsd,f0ukxzr,t3_d6mum9,1568943507.0,I don‚Äôt remember much of anything at all. Even things from yesterday I don‚Äôt have a clear memory of. My therapist says it‚Äôs common as once your ptsd starts repressing it just takes everything with it. New info can hurt you so your brain keeps it away
