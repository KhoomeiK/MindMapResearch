Was my family there for me? Oh no, I was a terrible person. Infact one of my cousins told me he was coming across country to bring me back home and I was going to do a bunch of clear to get off the black was his answer to my addiction problem.

Now I am a little over a month clean, the WDs and PAWs were hellish but I starting to feel me again. I still have depression and anxiety issues but I don't want to run away from it anymore. 

Going to NA meetings really helped me because the people who sat around me knew the score and dealt with the same thing. The first thing that was said to me at a meeting is the newcomer is the most important person as they can see they can become clean and the others are reminded to stay clean."

addiction,f6ujkk6,t3_dt3qk3,1573163792.0,"Well, it certainly did a lot of life destruction but this last detox were I'm two weeks in is the Kratom, gaba, and clondine. I had loperamine just for anti poo issues and didn't do any dumb shit like loping not that it didn't cross my mind but I was like GDI you aren't that desperate and I was like Nope, not this time. Not going down another rung again.

If you do Kratom check out their sub and there is a great guide for detox when it comes to that. I kind of screwed up and counted wrong with what I had left for my husband so I didn't wean myself off the Kratom some. Then again some people just Kratom forever. Gabapetin is my true life saver when I was able to take a certain dose because it really was my go between with oxy when it came to pain. Cuz I sure had to wait till work was over before I could do it.

Last and not least the true life saving tip is find an NA and just go, you don't even have to talk. I did my first time and broke down every damn time I opened my mouth but they know. They all went through that same situation maybe it was a little different or reason but its a cross to bear. To know the taste of that drug of choice and know you just cannot have again. Well you can but then relapsed and fuck that stupid shute.

Just know really you are alone in this there's others who hear the temptation but just said no. First thing some one said to me is the newcomer is always the most important not only to see that you can be clean but to remind you why you went clean. The reflection is there, all the broken glass even if our skins is different."

Really like that the CBD make a lot of back pain just fade off in the distance all lot longer than oxy did.

I don't know how people do Kratom every day because it tastes like dirt to me. Supposedly your tolerance goes up substantial after getting back on the beast. I did less than half my usual dose when I relapsed but before the end of week I was back to usual dose"

Here's the thing it a partial antagonist but it won't bind on the receptors. The ones at gas stations and etc aren't worth.

Also I use gabapentin for my withdrawals and sciatica nerve pain but your liver can only process 300mg every 30-45. So I drink tea or coffee along with a fatty meal to help it process better. Eating spicy foods help with it and the amount my previous PN is lot higher than most so I take like 2000 mg almost a day but it gives me a chance to function for awhile."

Never letting his body get rest in-between or recouping his serotonin levels. He is doing a terrible job as loving partner in this relationship. You doing the drugs with him only helps him think that this is an okay factor in the relationship. Please don't jeopardize your life any longer with him unless he is willing to get clean yesterday. He needs to be honest with his addictions with his physician, take only the actual prescribed medications, cut cold turkey with all the uppers, and find a NA meeting.

If you really want to continue the relationship, I still stand with finding some NA meetings in your area and tell her to try Kratom for the upcoming WDs but better to cut cold turkey then to get on subs. She is asking for help from you and that is very difficult for someone to tell their loved ones that they have addiction problems. Most people rather not want to do anything with the ""addict"" and I understand that it's triggered you because of losing a loved one with the same shit.

Its very mentally and emotional draining on family members and loved ones and he lost girlfriends and friends in the past because it became too much for them to deal with it all. 
Something simple as a woman screaming could cause him to have an flashback, panic attack and more. And maybe its not stress but him being triggered with flashbacks that are causing him to have the manic episodes again.

When the person is having a flashback, they are no longer in the present but in the past of what caused them to be inflicted with this terrible disease. Sights, sounds, smells can recall both good and bad memories and I even have unfortunately caused my husband to have an panic attacks because of honest mistakes.  
Its good that he is taking Klonopins because it really helps with the anxiety and panic levels. He might need an adjustment with the amount he takes or dosage level as tolerance does build. This is something that he needs to do the next time he is at the VA and yes the script bottle state s not to drive or work with heavy machinery but that's with all benzos.

relationships,ez9ocee,t3_d0i4x8,1567786458.0,"My father was an alcoholic and his family chose to ignore it and it only was a issue when he started to argue with everyone at the family parties. He came from a very large family and all of them were drinkers but his addiction was by far worst of the lot. 

I chose to ignore the best way I could as a kid/teen by staring at a computer screen and became addicted to AOL chatrooms and then online games. Every one just thought I had was good with computers because I was always on but in reality I was starting to show my own problems with addiction. 

At the end of the day the only one who could've done something is you and you alone. Yes, even though they offered assistance by saying tell us and offering rehab, they probably would never understand your anger towards them for failing with truly helping you and see themselves as victims instead."

Benzos are great with helping with the same sicknesses but not never into downers but each to their own when just in need that moment of peace/clarify/happy and that moment that counts.

As much as I despise my father for being one of top failures of a dad for years. I do get his struggles with alcoholism and wish he could give me some help"

My MIL and husband are domestic survivors and even though judge gave that evil the maximum sentence for the all the charges, they still changed Socials and moved across the county to a state they felt he would never find them in.

Please bear in mind that if you were diagnosed with PTSD that it's also mentally draining for your love ones as they support you though this and they too should speak with a therapist. 

My husband was diagnosed with PTSD along with severe depression and anxiety when he was a child from domestic abuse and it took me some time to understand what a teribble illness this is. Infact I'm still learning and I see a therapist about living day to day with him along with my own issues of depression."
