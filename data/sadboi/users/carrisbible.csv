Had an arguement with a friend over trying to make plans, and he was way more upset about it and told him I cant have a constructive conversation until he was calm. Whole time trying to tell myself, ""he is just stressed with other stuff and hasn't been utilizing his time well."" But feelings of dropping everything and just never talking to him or doing anything with this person anymore kept going through my head. He apologized, but I still told him I dont want to make any more plans and going to do my own thing (which still hurts). 

So past few days I had that awareness of the downs coming, so I tried to stay busy and productive but didn't help the impeding realization that my funk mood was here. Look forward to the next motivational moment I get out of this funk. Plus side, still got stuff I needed done or continuing the process, but feel all types of anxious and want to hide from the world."

More and more when I travel and return, I'm thinking of how I can just stay traveling, how mundane living in the societal norms (good job, house, wife, kids) and that it's not for me. Which, after much self reflection, I've always been that way. It's like that episode of South Park that Stan is diagnosed with asperger's and sees most things in the world as shit. Probably not the best analogy, but the point is I've always seen things from different perspectives than anyone around me in my life. I didn't know if I was just crazy or depressed or what, but over time I come to believe that this culture of life (USA) is not for me. And I didn't really put that into perspective until I started traveling.
Now approaching 30 years old, I find myself biding time for my close friends and family to be content in their lives and won't notice me being gone. I very much have been planning my escape route to start my next steps in life and move abroad. Checking in with those that matter the most to me to let them know I have all intentions of leaving. Some are happy for me, some dont want it to be, some passively or intentionally make me feel guilty. But my values and goals are not the same, and I empathetically let them understand what you want isn't the same as what I want, or need.

I started by doing my ""must see and visit"" spots and activities like a 5 day sailing trip from Panama to Colombia, hiking Machu Picchu, seeing the rainbow mountains in Peru, biking down the deaths road and the salt flats in Bolivia, or Iguazu Falls and other national parks. 

Once I figure out the big adventure activities, I figure out what the budget would look like and how long I need to complete the trip. If I can do all those things, great, if I can't do all of them oh well. Next time!

For me, I can take a leave from work and come right back (blessing) so my duration of the trip comes down to funds and what I'm able to save by the time I am looking to go. 

Next thing is figuring out logistics. Figuring out cities and towns to visit and stay. How to get to place to place. Also trying to not over plan and leave time to stay in a spot you really like or to leave early if it's no good. 

Also a good tip, practice the spoken language of where your going. I been using Duolingo and was intending on doing tutoring but again, Coronavirus cancelled all courses and tutoring programs...

I typically over plan but that just builds my confidence and competence for traveling solo, and I love planning trips!"
GetMotivated,etwxhc0,t1_etwwb9q,1563286594.0,Because getting your teeth kicked out gives you the greatest lesson of failing. Don't let it happen again. Find a different way that improves your chances of not getting kicked. Some day you can be the one kicking teeth instead.
TravelHacks,etwuqiu,t3_cdsrqy,1563284586.0,"South-east Asia has been extremely popular it seems the last couple years. Its affordable and traveler friendly. South & Central America is my next solo trip (planning in progress) and seems very affordable. I am planning to do Panama, Columbia and Peru for roughly three weeks. Europe is pretty easy to do solo but it is a but more expensive.

Where are you departing from and how long of a trip?"
solotravel,etui808,t1_etsdckl,1563213123.0,"Ditto. Love doing things on my own and the way I want. When I feel the need to be social, I will. I'm an introvert as well but willing to spark up conversations with strangers or hostel-mates. Though I am not as graceful in inviting peers to join in me is walking around or getting food and drinks as others that invite me to do something. I feel extremely awkward at times inviting others, but if you approach me, and ask if I want to join? Sure! More times than not, I am down to join. Also comfortable in saying no thanks."

solotravel,et9xjpo,t3_cahztj,1562607600.0,"My very first trip was to China and had that same feeling! Everything just felt like a better fit than anything back home. I felt a disconnect from my own culture and practically questioned my life style and those close to me in comparison of how I was seeing others live halfway across the world. So when I returned, I changed how I lived and wanted to live based of of what I learned about the culture in China. 

Embrace the different cultures and keep some of the practices you believe will improve your life. Great gift of traveling."

TravelHacks,eshy3wc,t3_c7trxe,1562003193.0,"Easily. I did 16 days, 8 countries. I flew, took the train and flixbus. Staying in hostels will be roughly $10-45 a night depending on what you are looking for. My spending budget was the same ($2000) and only spent $1600. So unless you're looking to take a ton of hosted tours and other unnecessary activities you should be completely fine. 

Also have money for those ""oh shit"" emergency moments. I screwed up on the blabla ride pick up spot to a airport and had to uber... which was expensive giving it was 50 minutes away."
solotravel,ery0u0i,t1_erxa083,1561397885.0,"Agree. Last year I backpacked Europe solo but meet up with a couple friends for a small portion of the trip. We met up in Amsterdam (all at our pace to get there) hung out there for a day and went to Oktoberfest in Munich. After fest, we parted ways, continuing our own trips. But even 4-5 days with my friend's, I was getting annoyed with them and having to sacrifice how I would do things if solo."
