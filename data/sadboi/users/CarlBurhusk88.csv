All thia is teaching him is that he isn't worth support anymore. Your husband thinks that family support enda at 18. Maybe this would work back when employment at Burger King would pay your tuition and all bills. Why does college signify the only path to success for some people? Hell, even the board game 'life' gives you the choice between college and immediately getting a job and shows that you can still be a success, despite the road you take. It's about the journey and the choices we make on the jounrney.

You're at a fork in the road and don't be afraid to tell your husband  you can continue supporting your son while he learns and contributes financially to the home. Kicking him out at 18 is such a slap to the face, especially now. 

Ultimatum? He goes, you go. Do not let your husband destroy your relationship with your son. If he wants to, by all means, that's his choice. Do not follow him through the rapids when there's a perfectly good bridge to use.

rant,fnnthjw,t1_fnn4lsc,1587101240.0,Because they said so I guess. Wish they'd answer you. Would have loved to see what moral high ground they'd take.
rant,fnnt6um,t1_fnn9hqg,1587100989.0,"You said exactly what I would have said, minus being a minister. So many people forget the community that is formed. It's a spiritual family coming together and sharing their love for God. Hard thing to suddenly be away from. Thanks for still offering that safe space over the internet."
nosleep,fnk4la2,t1_fnjgbiu,1587014794.0,"Yea, i don't think this is the end. I have a feeling there will be a wrap up chapter. I'm crossing my fingers AND toes."
self,fnicrmz,t1_fncf9uc,1586977805.0,It is a very real and also very sick joke. Thanks federal government!
nosleep,fnc1wb3,t3_g0s5ob,1586826884.0,I'm concerned. You were tactful and decisive at the start. Now you're fumbling around like a baby learning to walk. What happened?! Hope we have a decent twist ending because all of a sudden all character development has gone out the window.  :(
RedPillWomen,fnbzo0g,t1_fnbycyo,1586825552.0,"Thanks for having a sense of humor.

Sorry I don't find a marriage proposal in central park during a pandemic very romantic. Especially in the most heavily hit state in the country."
RedPillWomen,fnbvx3d,t3_g0r6ih,1586823379.0,Did the proposal happen at least 6 feet apart?
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fnbf3b3,t1_fnbeww8,1586814409.0,My clients will love it! Weekend project for the win! Thank you!

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fnbe27b,t3_g0rl1y,1586813884.0,This is lovely. Think I'll do the same for the rehabilitation program I work for!
nosleep,fnbduzd,t1_fnbbl1n,1586813784.0,Will you follow up with a prequel? Would love the backstory of the group involved in this!
self,fnacat0,t1_fn75dnz,1586794975.0,"Preaching to the wrong mental health worker. Momentary relief in the form of taxable unemployment is dangerous. It may give a boost now but just like my clients who recieve their SSI every month, the high from recieving the money fades. They have my support to develop coping skills and how to properly utilize the money they are giving. 

I get everything you are saying. I just know the chemical boost money gives is temporary and can be dangerous.

Edit: also you have no idea what I have been through in my life. Thanks for making a sweeping generalization."
