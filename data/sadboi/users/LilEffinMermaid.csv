exAdventist,fcgtb20,t1_fcfr82q,1577643813.0,Yes this was the camp but I was told that the religion aspect was minimal and more or less a summer camp and a lot of non religious kids go to. From what I gathered this was almost exclusively religious indoctrination all day every day. I was not happy. my daughter to ask if she could be baptized in the lake at the camp I asked she not participate. The youth minister director called me I said the same thing. My daughters grandmother signed her up for the camp and the misnistry staff went behind my back to get permission for the baptism which she was more than happy to agree to. When I was asked if she could go to summer camp I expected an actual summer camp and 3 weeks later my child comes home from being nothing but being brainwashed and indoctrinated into a religious cult ideology and my curiosity lies in wondering if SDA is using things like summer camps and pathfinders to lure kids into nothing more than religious doctrine. She has since left the religion altogether and is.struggling with following along with their crazy nonsense for so long

And by the time I got her into public school the SDA kids had her convinced that she would be surrounded by drugs and violence like a war zone situation she cried almost the entire summer. These kids were in 6th grade. I was speechless. Their entire educational experience will only get them into an Adventist college and the cycle repeats itself. Maddening. And during the half day fridays half of the day was spent in chapel and the rest was basicslly lunch smdh. The first time we had to have a church sermon and prayer session before a BAND CONCERT i lost it it's just too much to take in really. After starting public school it took all of a week for my to flourish, she is succeeding in every way imagionable, she even has real friends its great. I never realized how oppressed she was in the Adventist system until she was out and I will blame myself for not yanking her out sooner. Kids are very resilient when they feel secure. Bless their hearts. Money is the root of all evil fits perfectly here. Jesus was homeless and barefoot, and we are supposed to be living in his image??

I was already living 1100 miles away from my ex (for 7 years) and he paid no support whatsoever, had visits for 6 weeks during the summer and ever other holiday. (court ordered) My living situation changed drasticslly, and I too, needed help from my family and needed to move to yet another state which would have had zero impact on the visitation schedule. He fought me in court just because he could, and I was forced to stay in what was the now empty home we were living in.  No car, I had only a mattress on the floor,  a couch and a blow up mattress for my daughter for 3  months before I was allowed to move. Emotions run high with custody cases and honestly if more parents could be as rational as you, there would be a much much better outcome for all the parties involved.

When they first asked if she could go to church with them, it never dawned on me how deep this rabbit hole goes. I was naive...STRIKE 1. My daughters grandmother wanted her to have the best education and wanted to put her in private SDA school because they test higher blah blah blah, naive me yet again... STRIKE 2 (being asked to pray before a parent teacher conference or a phone call I knew I had to get her out)   By now I knew  just how badly this was going to end because my daughter spent 3 years going to  church, AND an SDA school AND OF COURSE JOINING the pathfinders and SUMMERS at Camp Kalauqua she was already immersed and  brainwashed. She began having full blown panic attacks and even  throwing herself on the floor begging us to accept jesus christ in our hearts  to prove we love her. Devastating....STRIKE 3 She wants out, and the shit they put her through for her choice should be illegal. And since shes left shes now just angry about everything and at her ""family"" for treating her like that for most of her young life. Shes got a long road ahead but she will never be alone. Reading the replys breaks my heart to have so many people saying how lucky our girl is, being supported so deeply by us, because I have been watching her world crumble around her and I'm not sure how she would have been able to escape that ""life"" alone. I was never indoctrinated but I'm faced with the fallout from it every day.

She got in a lil bit of trouble teaching her fellow preschoolers dont push by sublime at 4 years old in the middle of parochial school whoopsie she was intrigued by marilyn Manson but I think shes scared of him same with rob zombie hahaha I found out this morning shes been rocking system of a down and RATM and I have a very strong dislike for Coldplay but not for a reason it just rubs me the wrong way so I think never gave them a chance because of me but I can say with certainty ertainty I'm over MCR and their fucking black parade because I heard it 100000 times when it was new and now 15 years later it's still playing ugh lol

I don't agree with any organized religion and I never will because none of it follows through with what actually stands for and when all of them are reading from the same damn book but couldn't be farther apart from their beliefs. It's a fucked up mind game and they are going nothing but getting free money the whole time. Its sick. And they are the ones shoving their beliefs on others and spreading hate and judgement becsuse someone told them to and oh my God trying to bring religion into politics. This country was literally founded on the principles that God has no place in the government and yet that's what they are still fighting for it probably wouldn't bother me so much if they had any amount of intelligence to go off of but they dont its ignorant ideas someone else told them to think of in the first place.

Logic is not needed because we have faith. Bullshit. You can't deny proven facts. But you also say that everything happens for a reason so why did she have to suffer like this was it all part of Gods plan for her to endure such abuse from the very hands of the lords most faithful and obedient servants? Uh that's definitely not a God I want watching over me, he sounds like a straight up asshole to me."
exAdventist,f7zqd8q,t1_f7zma89,1574114528.0,"Thank you all I really wanted was some insight from people who sadly have first hand experience with something like this because I really cant imagine what this feels like to be on the leaving side of a belief system. Its just breaks my heart how this is so normal for so many people. I'm not sure where the whole slipknot thing got started I think the middle school kids are trying to bring them back to life or seem edgy somehow when they're barely even teenagers but oh well they'll learn one day lol but watching her discover ""new"" kinds of music has been an amazing experience to watch and she likes a little bit of everything except Metallica and Coldplay hahaha but nevertheless shes really into it at the moment so we are just letting her run with it and I am curious as to which paths she's gonna wonder down later on having been through this crap so young"
exAdventist,f7zdzpn,t1_f7zai62,1574109301.0,Ok I'm officially speechless holy shit just wow!!! I get what she was so damn scared of now though sigh I will never see this as anything but a straight up cult.
exAdventist,f7zc2nr,t1_f7ymh36,1574108497.0,It is really scary how similar and just seriously awful everyone's stories are. Thank you for your kind words it sounds like you are coming from world of experience and a level head too I admire that. I had a nightmare of a childhood and I will do anything to give her what I never even had a chance of having. In my head if she has a strong sense of support we at least have a fighting chance to get through life's insanity. I think she will carry this experience with her for a long time I just hope she can find it in her heart to let go of the anger instead of trying to carry that extra weight on your shoulders for no reason. I mean she is still pretty young so maybe we caught the monster in time and she can actually find her inner peace whatever that may be.
exAdventist,f7za5pf,t1_f7z21kk,1574107691.0,Thank you for all the positive vibes you radiate on such a sensitive topic. I really appreciate your insight.
exAdventist,f7z7hr1,t1_f7z5sdd,1574106555.0,"Oh wow they really dont believe in actual hell? That's wild because someone somewhere along the lines convinced this kid that I was going to hell because I make bad decisions and that unless I made some grand gesture and surrender to god I'm gonna burn. This poor kid had literal panic attacks over the thought of this for almost 2 years I think. I mean after today I'd believe these people would say or do anything to fit god into their insane narrative. And the simple fact that every single religion cherry picks ""the most important"" parts of the bible to believe. Not to mention the fact that the bible is a bunch of people telling secondhand accounts of the event anyway. Poor fact checking throughout entire book 0/10 would not recommend."
exAdventist,f7z3xjx,t1_f7yn3yt,1574104941.0,Well now that she knows shes allowed her own thoughts and is allowed to ask questions about stuff I think she will be more aware of the signs. Am I missing something or is the need for complete control and berating your children into submission a common occurrence among the SDA or is it just my asshole ex doing what he does best? She is not buying into it in the slightest and from my perspective its almost comical when he texts me to tell me to make her talk to him because I am a parent and Its my job to make her do things. What role does the outrageous control over your children have to do with the religious aspect of it because it seems that this is just the way it is in most families and I'm really curious as to why this is seen as normal?
