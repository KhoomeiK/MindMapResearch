We used a female student's voice, one whom all of us found soothing. People called a phone number. When someone would call in the process would begin. The software would listen for a response but as long as there was noise on the line it would stay silent. The bot would ask another question once the caller was silent. This would continue until the caller hung up. 

We recorded the responses from the callers in order to fine tune the questions, timing, and delivery. We also learn to trigger certain questions with appropriate responses.

 The questions were: How are you? But HOW are you doing, really? OK? Are you okay? Tell me some more? How do you feel about that? Have you talked to anyone else? Why not? So you're telling me? No tell me what is really going on? Have you called someone you love and told them about this? Don't you think that you should? Would you call be back if it doesn't work out.

We were shocked when we reviewed the responses to the questions. We were expecting drunks or pranksters to call in with streams of profanity, and we got a few of those. Plus fake calls that were made for someone's benefit within earshot. But most of all we were surprised at how many stressed out students called in to just vent.

The dry cough seemed to be getting better when I suddenly developed a URI (upper respiratory infection) which came on fast. Realizing that it was a severe infection I self isolated. I warned my friends to stay away and avoided all outside contact.

It was the worst URI that I've experienced in decades. Then bronchitis set in, and this time my cough had a green sputum, caused a rattle in my chest and in the bronchial tubes.  Copious amounts of sputum came from my head and chest. 

Usually, I can shrug off a cold or the flu in 10 days, but there was no getting rid of this one. I used antibiotics that I had but the meds helped only a little.

LucidDreaming,fjemjqg,t3_fcvd4e,1583274407.0,"My dreams take place after there has been a major change on earth, which is no longer inhabited. I don't know how it ended but there was a natural cataclysmic event and the earth that we know is now gone. Although it happened quickly, there was enough time to prepare for the killer blast. Many people decided to stay and perish in the cataclysim event. People do not fear death. Now, everyone is young, I am an old sage, and an engineer by trade.

In all of my lucid dreams I am now living on another planet. The qualifier ""all"" means that there are a number of dreams where I was working and living on another planet.

In past dreams, and in several situations I was living as a retired man who had been an engineer and an instructor.  On one planet it was a forest preserve where varieties of forests were kept in a library that encompassed the entire planet. I had something to do with constructing and populating the communities. The settlements were small, vertical clusters of high rise communities, spaced a good distance from each other, with each community being complete. My home was a ceramic tube house that was small and yet most comfortable. It had a bright white exterior, dull finish, and was one of many that were stacked on top of each other. The weather and temperature was always perfect, and the air smells extremely clean and fresh. Breathing in the air is a delicious treat. 

Another facility where I lived and worked was on a planet that was much like the moon, but there was gravity that was more like earth's. In an enclosed facility their were indoor swimming pools, a ready supply of water, and red carpet everywhere which seemed to affect the well being of those living there. Unlike the green forest planet this planet, needed bright colors are added to the environment to protect the well being of the human population such as bright reds. The air inside the buildings smells of recycling, hints of ozone, its definitely manufactured. It's all about work at this location, it's considered to be luck if you get ""only"" a temporary assignment. The large windows in the facilities are actually a type of plasma beam. Glass would be impossibly thick and heavy to use.

The last place shown to me is in the belly of a craft. I was a lead engineer and this was my final voyage for me as we were on the way back. I was looking at my students knowing that this would be their last class with me as their instructor. I would miss them, and I would miss their fresh perspectives in problem solving, but I was going on to another location, possibly retiring. As I gazed at them, all of them busy working on their various projects, I thought how lucky I was to have been in their lives, even if it was just a short time. My connection to them was formal, but I felt affection and that I had an emotional investmet to them that they were unaware of. I wanted all of them to be successful, happy, and felt a bit envious of their youth. 

Our transport has a wet metallic smell like an old aluminum cooler. It's definitely old, not dirty, but could be cleaner. There are some areas of the transport that smells like bio in a refrigerator. There's nothing aesthetically ""nice"" about the transport. The interior lighting is a special color of yellow that protects our eyes."

AskReddit,fj5k3yu,t3_fbiay6,1583034696.0,"MOSCOW – A new book reveals that Russia purposely stranded 3 gay cosmonauts on the moon in 1987.

A new Russian book, “Stranded on The Dark Side,”  and the upcoming documentary based on the book, reveals that three gay cosmonauts who went on a secret mission to the moon in 1987, were purposely left there by the Russians.

Vladimir Kazhazhi, Yevgeny Babrsyukhin, and Igor Plotkin were sent into space on July 15th, 1987.  They walked on the moon and transmitted valuable data back to the Russians.  But they were never seen again.  All communication with them was cut off – and the spacecraft that landed on the moon was disabled remotely.

NASA is investigating the allegations and has agreed to send a lunar probe to try to find the bodies of the cosmonauts.

“Gays were not accepted in Russia at the time – and they still are not,” said Russian astrophysicist, Galina Mordenka.  “The Russian government launched the gay cosmonauts and let them die up there – on the moon.”

The revelations have sent shockwaves across the Space Exploration community around the globe.  “It’s outrageous,” said Buzz Aldrin.  “To leave an astronaut, any astronaut, on the moon, is disgraceful and barbaric.”

￼

The documentary film, which will be released in the U.S. in October , also reveals that the three men were the first humans to have sex in outer space – something that the Russians wanted to experiment with and be the first to do. “Those men were probably the best cosmonauts, and astronauts, that have ever lived. They were very, ver talented and ver brave.  My heart goes out to their families,” said NASA director, Tom Hillstrom.  Hillstrom had heard rumors about the Russian moon landing, but now is convinced it happened."

AskReddit,fine8qx,t3_f8jxyc,1582561753.0,"My boss was the executive director of a state and federally funded private non-profit. I was hired to manage a program that worked in conjunction with the parent organization which she was the director of.  I was in my early thirties, in a long-time relationship, and was passionate about the program that I managed.  

I did not realize that I was dealing with a classic borderline personality. And as I write this I  realize that this could be a long and arduous story about being seduced by a cougar. So, to make a very long and embarrassing story palatable I'll cut it to the ""just the details"". 

Late one evening she called me in a panic and said that she was afraid, that she thought that someone had broken into her home but there wasn't anything missing. I told her to call the police and that I'd drive over.  When I arrived she had a story about why the police weren't summoned but could I check her house for her. She was wearing a bath robe.  My sixth sense told me that something wasn't right, I should have listened to it, I'm no fool, I knew better, and I should have left immediately!

After checking the windows and doors and finding nothing she said that she was afraid and would I stay awhile. I declined, was moving to the door when she threw herself on me sobbing, trembling, and begged me to stay for just a little while. She was not a small woman, she was on top of me and I crumble to the floor under her weight. She had me pinned under her and I knew in that moment she had done this before and had perfected her technique. It was over pretty fast, saying nothing as I left I was pissed, and felt stupid for having allowed myself to fall victim.  I confided with the guys in my circle of friends, and they all told me to get as far away from her as possible. 

After I resigned some of the female board members of the organization cornered me one day while I was having lunch. They demanded that I tell them why I had left  the organization so quickly. They were upset that I had left and they wanted answers. It was an opportunity to let it all out, but I said nothing  derogatory, but I suggested they keep an eye on the financials of the organization. A few years after I had distanced myself from her she was caught embezzling, apparently making off with millions. It  made headlines every week for over a year. 

While working at my new job I was seriously injured. Recovery from the injuries was a three year ordeal. During this time my long-term partner began drinking alcoholically and overdosed on barbiturates. I felt like this was partly my fault because I was consumed with suppressed rage and not paying attention to my relationship. Not one day goes by that I don't think about us, and what we had. 

Forgiveness is an inside job that can take of lot of work, but it's been my only path to freedom and peace of mind.  Sometimes I wonder how and why did all of this happen to me, but life ""just is""."

His ""act"" was to be offended and hurt, drawing his intended victim closer so that he could strike. Because he's not considered to be a threat to the women he hangs with, women feel drawn to him. I hear that he is a master at cunnilingus and he seems to be a happy camper, as do his girl friends. Could be your *friend* was looking for a pity fuck as well because *he is keenly aware of how he's equipped*.

One other friend lost his penis because of a blasting cap the detonated in his pants pocket. His testicles were left intact and they are apparently in good condition because he is one horny beast. His shtick is tell someone his sad tale of woe and talk them into pegging him. He pretends that it's the first time he's ejaculated since the accident. His ability to have multiple climax per sessions with prostate stimulation gives one reason to pause.

You are a human being and deserving of love and being treated with dignity. 

As a young boy I was physically abused by my father to the point where I thought of suicide. Six year olds don't normally ponder suicide. The mental abuse was just a piece of the puzzle that allowed me to form ideas about myself that were lies. 

Spending the better part of my life undoing the damage through counseling and group session I now understand what makes me tick and how erroneous my concepts of self were. As I have healed I have developed long-term friendships closer than any blood family. Surrounding myself only with people who care and love me, the bonds that I have with my family of choice are deep. 

I've had to learn to speak my mind and to stand up for myself. Before my mother passed I told her that she was the only reason why I had maintained contact with the family, that we had little in common, and that I saw no reason to continue communication with them after she passed. This may have been painful for her to hear but it needed to be said. Today, my interactions with them are tightly controlled by me. If it's a holiday dinner I arrive, spend the necessary time, say hello to everyone, and then I leave. No one gets a chance to ""take me aside and have words with me."" 

Whereas my family choice are wonderful people whom I am devoted to. We have much in common and have experienced a wonderful past time together. We have traveled to many destinations and they know how much I love them.

And, that my business associates had meetings about *my* personal situation. I was to caught up in the drama to know that I needed to get out, but it's a downhill trip and it will just get worse. 

Highlights of a sick relationship going from bad to worse:

1. No matter how much money I deposited in the joint account it always seemed to need more. 
2. Locking myself in the car in order to get away from a raging female only to have a spading fork firmly implanted in the truck lid. (super human strength *demon* stration).

Dette  er den beste forklaringen som noen har lagt ut om det tragiske tapet av  Ari Behn. I bedring etter alkoholisme vet jeg hvor grove forventningene  til juleferien kan være på noen som opplever følelsesmessig smerte,  spesielt den typen som er forårsaket av tap av en familie. Hans  problemer med alkohol løftet smerte og lidelse til høyere nivåer og Ari  innrømmet like mye. En forteller kommentar som Ari kom med, var at han  på grunn av alkoholisme ikke ville se barna sine i voksen alder.  
Jeg  visste at han hadde vært i behandling, men etter behandling for  avhengighet fortsetter man mest med støttemøter. Anonyme alkoholikere er  ikke for alle, men mange mennesker har funnet seg unna depresjonen  forårsaket av alkoholisme ved å delta på møtene. AA har endret livet  mitt til det bedre og for mange andre også. Mine oppriktige velsignelser  til Aris barn og hans utvidede familie.

This is the best explanation that anyone has posted on the tragic loss of Ari Behn.  In recovery for alcoholism, I know how rough the expectations of the Christmas holidays can be on someone who is experiencing emotional pain, especially the kind that is caused by the loss of a family.  His problems with alcohol raised the his pain and suffering to higher levels and Ari admitted as much. One telling comment that Ari made was that because of alcoholism he would not see his children into adulthood.  

I knew that he had been in treatment but after treatment for addiction one most continue with support meetings. Alcoholics Anonymous isn't for everyone, but many people have found  away out of the depression caused by alcoholism by attending the meetings.  AA has changed my life for the better and for many others as well. My sincere blessings to Ari's children and his extended family."

The cat thing happened to me at a friend's sister's home while sitting on her sofa.  I had never met this woman before and we had just sit down to tea. 

About that time felt the presence of a heavy, invisible cat that was brushing it's tail in my face, gently letting me feel his claws dig into my leg, and doing the massage thing that cats do. 

The cat flashed images into my mind of it's right jaw and he let me know that it was painful for him to eat when he was alive. He showed me an image of his emaciated body with his fur falling out. He let me know  that he was an outdoors cat, had been brought into the house when I he got sick, and that his favorite place was on a wide window sill where he could see the back yard. He showed me a man at a distance which I think meant that he hated the woman's husband. 

The situation got even stranger because ""kitty boy"" wanted me to tell her that he loved her, and for her not to worry about him. 

He then showed me an image of himself as a healthy cat and in all of his cat lordliness, he was most happy again.  So, I cleared my throat and then asked the lady if she had recently lost a cat?  Her tears started flowing and I found myself an intermediary for a ghost cat.

There's much more to the story, but it's the one an only time anything like this has happened to me."
LucidDreaming,fgpvkxp,t3_ezoxy0,1581012853.0,"I wanted to see what I looked like from afar. In a dream, meditating, I could view myself without a body, just the soul. 

As my physical body disappeared I was astounded to see that my light body looks like a huge mop head made of silk light fibers. These fibers of light stretch in an direction connecting me to all that is. I could see where there is doubt, mistrust, ambivalence, holding back and not receiving love the fibers were dim.  Identifying where there is darkness in my being, and then illuminating it love, kindness, and gratitude is the purpose of my being."

LucidDreaming,ffz062l,t3_evv1y4,1580359798.0,"My lucid dreams are incredible in that I get commune with loved ones who deceased (in my present reality that is). 

For instance: I've killed myself; euthanized people; made care plans after being diagnosed with Alzheimer disease; discovered we were drinking polluted well water that caused a miscarriage; dreams that seem to be there for the mere experience (This is what it feels, tastes, smells, and looks like.); dreams where I'm rebuilding structures and I'm communicating in another language; dreams where I'm living in Russia, Israel, France, Germany, and am only able to speak the local language.

There are those lucid dreams which are fun, and involve friends in some other time and place, and evoke a sense of joy.

And then there are the working dreams: Dreams where I'm on a job and dealing with the dynamics of employment, dreams  where I never seem to fully grasp whatever the full situation is, dreams where it's a lot like trying on hats."
AskReddit,ffosbmi,t1_ffgblzs,1580081057.0,"A long time friend had serious anxiety and trust issues, and he saw a therapist twice a month. A non-drinker, he was on Prozack, but his anger issues still bubbled over frequently. 

One day, I asked my friend what he thought might be at the root of his depression. I was also driving him to an employer required anger management program, and it seemed like he wasn't making much headway with his mental heath therapist.

He told me that he had been raped repeatedly as a fourteen year old by an adult female and her husband. They told him that they were doing him a favor and making sure that he grew up straight.

There's more to the story, enough to fill several volumes, but the perpetrators got away with it because ""only someone gay would complain about it"" in their LDS community. 

Today, he is a functioning human being and enjoys some happiness. But authority figures can trigger issues; trauma can unleash an intense rage; he can't handle emotional pain; he sometimes torchers himself with the way he handled past transgressions; and when people hurt him he will play the event over, and over, and over like a looped tape, repeating the same phase."
