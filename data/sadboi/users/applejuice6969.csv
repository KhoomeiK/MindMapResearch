BPD,fq637yc,t3_gh2frs,1589123563.0,"You wrote exactly what's been going on with me personally. The feeling is so so painful that I just wish we both could have a solution to this. What I try to remind myself is that there are days where I think about killing myself much less, and it's not as painful as certain nights. I just hold on to the thought of those less-painful days to ease through the feeling. Just know you're not alone."

BPD,fhu2nkf,t1_fhqefcq,1581881113.0,"Man I do agree, trying to explain it to someone gets my emotions flared up even more, making the conversation even harder and both parties end up feeling kinda bad. I’m glad my words are somehow relatable, I try my best to word out my situation to see the bigger picture when I’m in a crisis, perhaps you can try that out too :)"

If it was alien abductions, how were there 2 Sarah's in one scene? (the ending) I have so many questions. Is it the directors' goal for the audience to have multiple questions? IDK but if it is, he did a pretty good job."
