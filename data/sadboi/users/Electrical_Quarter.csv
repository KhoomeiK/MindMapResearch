death,fope73d,t3_g8srsu,1587959242.0,"Honestly, I’m 27 and my parents kicked me out at 18 and I dreaded the day they were gone and my grandma showed me an old home video of when I was 5 living in japan and my mom and aunt were joking saying something like “over my dead body” and I started crying and said “if mama dies, I will die” and they all thought it was funny and I broke down because it’s 22 years later and I still feel like there’s a part of me that will die when those who took care of me die. But 27 is easier than 15, the same as 16 was easier than 15. You meet people throughout your life that serve equally as important roles as she does. You learn to care for them as they care for you. You need to keep going and make decisions that you know she would be proud of after she’s gone the same as you’ve made them as she’s been here. 

Believing in god won’t make your pain less than what it is, you need to acknowledge it and learn what can make it subside in a way that will help you improve your quality of life because you’re going through some shit right now and I know you’re a strong person because you’re asking for help when most people don’t and it ends up setting them back. Practice self care and be kind to yourself, everyone is scared shitless more times a day than you’d think, but it takes a strong person to admit them and overcome them.

Having someone pay for my is nice but I also want to take my date out with expenses on me if they do the same thing for me.

I didn’t want to tell my parents and for some reason thought these girls were my friends when they really just kept me around to bully me. This was when I was like 8 or 9 during 4th grade: their mom believed them when they said my mom was at the mall to pick me up and they ditched me there (this is pre-cell phone era) and it wasn’t until my mom called the girl’s mom because she worried whether I was going to eat with them or at home. That girls mom then told my mom she left me at the mall 6 hours ago and to this day I don’t remember how I killed the time but I remember my mom beating my ass for being friends with them, then I ended up beating that girl up at school and was transferred to a different school for 5th grade where I became best friends with a girl who was Muslim and also raised in a multicultural household and we just got each other and decided what was cool and pretty together. I feel like without that friendship I wouldn’t have allowed myself to really even think there was a side of me that could be pretty and be seen as pretty. I went through a shitty phase of wearing makeup and wasting time and money but I’m now in my late 20s and don’t wear makeup often but mainly because I feel like I’m shit at putting it on haha. It takes true skill and I’m too lazy. 

Sorry if that giant chunk was just a sad story, kids are fucked up and I started getting really self conscious and growing self aware when I was 9-10. It’s kind of a hormonal rollercoaster from then until like 15, little less from 15-18, and adulthood is an entirely different mess (Idk why I’m writing this as if you aren’t an adult -_-) the most important takeaway for me from the last 10 years was to practice fucking self care though. The amount of times I wanted to punch my mirror vs read a positive affirmation I put on a sticky note on my mirror has decreased. I wrote “give yourself 3 compliments” so I do that now when I look at myself and I’ve gotten pretty creative with them and would never ever give anyone the same compliments I give to myself. Like “your eyebrow looks nice on one half” “you were on time to work” “a homeless guy said ‘nice ass’ so you probably would say the same if you could see it”"

If you’re worried [here’s an article from 2014](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a19910594/masturbation-study/) that says women average 4 times a week so if you’re worried for whatever reason there’s that dated probably extremely inaccurate article. Most of my friends do it daily but a lot of them don’t talk about it (including myself). 

I’ll always remember my first week of college during orientation week this girl Martha got wasted and was taking to some dudes that were saying how many times a day they jerked off and she went into detail about what she does to get off and said “the most I done was 23 times, one day. In ONE DAY” and like 30 or so people heard her entire monologue and it became a running joke between me and my roommate. 

So I guess on average, people more or less do this 0-23 times a day. I’m at like -1."
