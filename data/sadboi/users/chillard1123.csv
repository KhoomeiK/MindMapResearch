There was also something orange resting by the edge of the photo. But in the next it was gone. Also, this place has the WORST vibes. There have been a lot of murders, sacrifices, and general ill will there. My mother grew up near it, when she was younger a group of people caught 9 cats, tied them up on rope hanging from the roof. Disembowled them while alive, then skinned them, there is still blood spatter everywhere. Also Ohio just in general is super off in the woods or at night."

I believe I said I was 16 or I said I was on the app, but I sent him pictures. There was no way in hell I looked 16. He always talked about meeting up. He asked really inappropriate questions. But he started slow, so it didnt feel weird. I trusted him. I remember I made up stories and told him. I freaked out, I gave him a bunch of misleading info. Idk why I was such a messed up kid but I told him I'd been raped. Little did I know it was actually a little true. (Whoooole other story). This lasted for 6 months, my dad found out because some kid told me to watch the video ""two girls one cup"", and hed seen it in my history. Which led to him finding the messages. Which apparently was a miracle, they were supposed to delete (like snapchat) but hadnt. He turned the ipod into the police, but they couldnt do anything because he technically ""thought I was 16"". I had never seen my dad madder before. Mine sucked, and still makes me scared. (Btw he was in his 30's, at least he said so) But it only lasted 6 months and it never got physical.

How does she make your home feel? Does it feel like someone invaded your space and negative or does it feel nice to be able to be around her more, and share your space with her and make it both of yours. If it's the first maybe think about making some compromises or looking at your relationship. It's not fair to either of you if you're unhappy, no one likes losing their privacy, and certainly no one likes to feel unwanted. With what you said about buying things and saying you already have them at your place, maybe shes trying to get some new things to make it more of a shared space?
