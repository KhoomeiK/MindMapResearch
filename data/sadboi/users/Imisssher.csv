I don’t know why no ones ‘freaking out’ about how basic bitch the clothing line is that Rinna’s daughters made. Like honestly where is the creativity.

My problems always shift from one health related thing to another like you said, funnily enough right now I have a shoulder nerve injury which is making the top part of my chest completely numb  which is making my anxiety go crazy!

abortion,fofe8sj,t3_g53hfo,1587733899.0,"Hi, fellow hypochondriac here and was 6 weeks with one of my medical abortions also. 

I have had two abortions via the pills. Both times I had severe cramping and sat on the toilet the whole time because it felt like i needed to poo. The whole process was around 4-5 hours for me. You may notice some chunks or sacks that come out either on your pad or in the toilet don’t be alarmed. 

This doesn’t mean you will have severe cramping, it effects everyone differently. All I can say is get everything you need that keeps you comfortable, have all your bases covered e.g. water, pads, comfortable place to sit or lay, comfy clothes, favourite tv show, food, hot water bottle and take your pain medication. Most importantly please have people around who you want there that love you. 

I suffer extreme health anxiety and have panic attacks over a sore throat and think I’m dying (that’s how ridiculous I am) but honestly as soon as I took this second set of pills and they started working all my anxiety took a back seat and my body took over and got me through. 

I know it’s so scary, don’t read the horror stories it will only feed your anxiety. You will get through this, you won’t need to go to the hospital or anything terrible like that. It’s just a few hours of discomfort and this too shall pass and the next day it’s all over, it’s just one bad day, please feel free to PM me if you have any questions or just need support 

Sending you lots and lots of love 💕💗

EDIT: side note I could of really used one of those big exercise balls during the process because it was hard to be comfy, hard to explain until you experience it but maybe if you already have one it may come in handy."

This doesn’t mean you will have severe cramping it effects everyone differently, make sure you have everything you need to keep you comfortable e.g water, air con or heater, food, favourite tv shows, pads, hot water bottle, comfortable clothing and take the pain medication they give you. Most importantly have a support system with you whether it’s your bf, friends or family members. 

Just keeping saying to yourself ‘this too shall pass’ and please don’t feel guilty, if you don’t want to have a baby that is absolutely fine. You know what is right for you. 

I suffer from extreme anxiety and was not anxious  for some reason after the second set of pills kicked in, your body kind of takes over and the anxiety takes a back seat. You will be okay promise I know it’s scary.
