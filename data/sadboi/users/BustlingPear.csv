CleaningTips,f7j2xxo,t1_f7j2pjw,1573769745.0,It's one of those bed bath and beyond humidifier/vaporizers for a bedroom/small apartment. We use it during the winter bc we're based in NY and the forced heat dries the air out terribly.

relationships,f79nh87,t3_duzvo8,1573510412.0,I've taken to muting the conversation and she just word vomits but she calls if I don't respond for too long. I'm slowly ghosting myself away. It's unfortunate because she was a good friend early on but as she's become more self centered and dramatic it's created so much toxicity. She's just not someone I want to surround myself with anymore
relationships,f79n3k1,t1_f79mzj3,1573510087.0,"I'll say that I can't give her the support she needs and she'll say ""you're always the friend I need"""
ptsd,f75vrm5,t3_dub9ut,1573419618.0,Nothing is more invalidating than having to leverage your trauma to be listened to. You do not owe people that emotional labor.
French,f6h7ccb,t3_dr54lz,1572838771.0,Asterix!
Museums,f54amqm,t3_dhymap,1571975901.0,"As someone finishing a Library Science degree, I have found that it is the most practical graduate dgree for your interests (I'm library sciences and art history). A lot of archival work looks for an MA, MS, or a concentration in Archives. I'm in New York so a lot of networking comes out of these graduate programs. I would recommend looking at the Pratt Institute School of Information (MS Library Information Sciences), NYU (MA Archives & Public History), and Hunter College (Dual MS/MA in Library Sciences and History) if you are seriously considering a career along these lines in these areas. Simmons in Boston also has a wonderful archival program. Most offer generous scholarships and stipended fellowship/internship opportunities."
French,f549wuy,t1_f517yiw,1571975276.0,Agreed. If you can take an immersion class that will make a huge difference. Community colleges usually have inexpensive classes. Meetup.com also has a bunch of French language groups and events. They'll be local to you and you might make a conversational friend out of it. Bonne chance!
