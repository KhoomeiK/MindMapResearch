I read this first: https://simpleskincarescience.com/dermarolling/

And decided it was worth the risk . 


People say dermastamping is safer. 

I've had great results I use both a .25 roller and a .5 I do it twice a week. 

I use the .5 on a Monday and .25 later in the week. My skin has gotten used to it so I definitely wouldn't start with my routine but my skin looks really amazing since I started using it. I no longer have smile lines naso labial folds and the jowlinness that I was starting to see is gone"

The spots are still gone and my forehead continues to look good, before the CB my forehead skin texture was so horribly different from the rest of my skin not just because of the lines but it just looked drier like it was a patch of skin from someone else's face 😂 it was so bad 


I will say that after my treatment I started a routine with actives and basically I used it to jumpstart my skincare routine. 

So I'm not sure if the CB last that long or if it was the combination of CB and my new skincare routine. 

It was well worth the money. I planned on doing it once a year but I honestly don't feel like I need it"

I just sort of found myself at a very low point one day and I could hardly recognize myself and I said that's enough. Now I'm slowly trying and when the old thoughts and insecurities creep up I do my best to push them away and replace them with new ideas for example if I start thinking what if I'll never be in another great relationship ? .. I tell myself , what if my next great relationship is just around the corner, what if I'm going to be happier than I've ever been in my life. And so far I have at least started feeling better about who I am and I think that's what helps others see my worth if I see it myself first.

I'm surprised that you didn't exchange selfies from the beginning so I wonder why both of you were content to just chat without seeing each other. It seems like maybe you were connecting with each other out of loneliness or some other reason. I could be wrong it just seems like an odd way to meet and then not even exchange photos right away seems odd. 

That being said, I think what this post is really about is your feeling of not being good enough and maybe never finding another person. I've had those fears before. 

What you said about your breakup reminds me of what happened to me. I had a very traumatic breakup that caused me to develop PTSD like symptoms and a temporary panic disorder. Some people never understood why I affected me so deeply. I gave up on love and dating and I saw myself alone forever. 

Now that I've taken time to heal from it I'm feeling hopeful about my future love life. You have to work on your self esteem because I guarantee you less attractive people than you are finding love it's all in your head. You'll attract more people when you love and accept yourself I see now that it's what I've been missing all along by believing that I didn't deserve love or that love was for everyone except me and that I had missed my chance I was just keeping good people from coming into my life. 

I wish you all the best."

I am taking a break from astrology to look at human design. At the end of the day there's no way to control planets or transits in fact I think all of these transits were perfectly planned to bring me to my destiny and there's no use trying to stay ahead of it.

I think she's one of those people who can tell when something is up and she's probably right most of the time, so she felt that there was something more to his statement and she ended up being right about it. However that's not really how you ask someone for more information she was jumping down his throat so the more you do that the less someone will want to open up and tell you. 

Besides if it's clear someone doesn't want to tell you specifically then I feel like you should be respectful enough to back off. I think she's one of those people that feel entitled to know their SO every thought. I think everyone should have some privacy and giving them freedom to not have to tell someone their every thought concern worry etc unless it directly affects you . 

In this case though his unemployment does affect her so that's something he should have been ready to tell her in his own time. 

So I can see why people fault him for continuing to hide what he was referring to in this particular situation however she is still not addressing things in a healthy manner.

Take all others upvoted advice but I have something to add. Mothers who weren't parented or ""mothered"" very well often will feel unsure of themselves. From what I read you say you were abused. There may be a physical reason for your baby's crying but often there can also be another reason you discomfort and her discomfort or one now there's no telling which came first chicken or egg. But you may both be experiencing discomfort around on another and your seeming inability to console her is heightening this feeling that you are unsuitable as a mom.

You can check out SGF their stock on seamless and no I don't work for them but I feel bad they're great guys and I don't want to see them close.


 So maybe we should suggest 6 ft shopping to our own grocery stores or if it would make you feel safer maybe drive out to lic where they're enforcing 6 ft shopping."
Unemployment,fl2dpra,t3_flvoyf,1584748663.0,"Hi! I just wanted to say you're not alone. I'm a teacher not with the doe and am barely hanging in there. Take a deep breath I was completely over the edge last week it didn't help me at all and was making me lose my appetite and become nauseous. 


So I don't think it'll affect you job prospects if you teach and have a certificate you will find work eventually. Also financially I'm not sure how it could affect you. Think about it, through no fault of your own you are unable to make a living. You've paid into that safety net . Now its there for you bc you need it. 

I freak out every so often but let's wait it out and see. I had just started this job after a few months of strange circumstances that brought me to being unemployed for two months for the first time in my life. We're gonna be ok."

MarriedAtFirstSight,fkxxz5t,t3_flal04,1584637599.0,"Honestly it was exhausting to watch Katie make a mountain out of a molehill. Does she simply choose any random comment of his to pick apart and start a fight over?

I could not understand how Derek entertained that discussion over HIS dreams. She's a real piece of work saying he's not mature when she basically had all the sass of a teenager during lunch with her mom. She disgusts me . Never liked her or Derek tbh. And I stated that early on with her pathetic delusions of romance and fairy tales."

DecidingToBeBetter,fkjl7mo,t3_fiuw73,1584249457.0,"Sorry to hear I made a similar career change recently and now my job is in question after only two weeks due to the covid. 

I think you should wait to see how covid will affect your area and also if you think it'll affect your current job I would just cut expenses as much as possible and look for a job that maybe won't be affected as much by the virus. 

I'm taking it a week at a time currently. It's incredibly nerve wracking. This hit me out of nowhere so I think just be cautious I know it sucks to feel stuck."

When I met him tho no attraction and honestly I could not find anything physical about him to love or be turned on by. I tried to stick it out knowing we were practically the same person but I only ended up hurting him when in the end I could not feel what I wanted to feel for him.  I had spent 1 year waiting to meet him too. Dude will always have a special place in my heart honestly. But yeah you can't do much if it's not there

Edit and for anyone wondering yeah we had plans to marry in his country I spent thousands visiting him and broke his heart and yeah I have some guilt I hope I paid for it tho cus I never found love or even someone like him again"

I'll just say why I don't hate her bc I don't think she hurt anyone but herself and to have it shown on tv like this omg I can't imagine I wouldn't be able to live it down. So I'm not sure what there is to hate about Jessica. She's almost pitiful"
scacjdiscussion,fk30pyf,t3_fg7fxb,1583814085.0,"Honestly it has been worth it bc it wasn't ANY trouble for me to do it. I enjoy it and it's a hobby of mine. I love it. 

As far as the people who do spreadsheets and graphic charts etc I figured that they enjoy doing that too and some people are like that.  It's funny what makes people happy all sorts of things that we wouldn't be interested in doing
 

Plus yeah I got the results I was looking for so that makes it worth it too and honestly I spend less than I've ever spent so that's a win. 


If it's a real burden on someone to do this I would say yeah doing anything you don't enjoy is not worth the trouble and I live by that"

I was unemployed for longer than I would've liked but the universe always provided just what I needed at the right time then when I really ran out of money I got hired. This isn't my dream job by far but i have a lot of perks and am overpaid for what it is so it's like a big break for me so I can regroup and manifest something better"

LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fjyg4z4,t3_fff1tr,1583696016.0,Honestly it's gonna be fun to see what changes next season are they gonna wait a year after ? I doubt it . That'll change a lot of things if they film and air it then only wait a few months to give an update.
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fjxu36h,t3_ff9e53,1583683366.0,"Well yeah she really aired their dirty laundry but obviously I liked hearing it even though it's none of my business. 
Supposedly after their hard times theyve figured out a way to coexist in the relationship. I think these funny threats are jokes she thinks are funny like maybe in her family they made jokes like that. But it's true men can't make the same jokes of violence and stalking. 

Barnett I keep saying has low self esteem so I think these messages of you're being annoying but still loveable are things he accepts being true about himself.  I personally don't think it'll last long given the fact that she had a lot to say about the problems they had and nothing to say about the solutions they found or what if anything makes the marriage feel okay and stable  now . All she said was we are learning eachother and that now they know how to party together."
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fjx4k8p,t3_fey39p,1583656404.0,"Kenny- we didn't see enough but I can just say he's very articulate and aging somewhat poorly his skin just looks paper thin I'm sorry 

Barnett- confused insecure low self esteem hence all these vulgar try hard jokes and uncomfortable in his own skin so attracted to Amber whos unapologetically herself. Just sad little man overall masquerading as some type of smartass. He did too much by strongly suggesting he'd choose Jessica. 

Carlton- made a damn fool of himself but I felt for him acting out like this deep down I think he's full of self hatred. I had a bi ex and he was such a mess. Bi guys need to be accepted honestly. Anyway diamond did deserve better. 

Cameron - god bless his tender soul I can't take his red cheeks and the weepiness and eyes tearing up over nothing. Talking about an ex he tears up.. and it's too much but just right for Lauren however he does seem like he can provide and would be a great hubby . Cheers. 

Damian- jury's out on the possibility of him having narcissistic tendencies. Honestly it's just weird to stay with someone who's so volatile and dramatic like Gi and the fact he's in it just means something is wrong with him too. But then again I'm not one to stick it out with someone who is rather change if I could.he could also just be dealing with it all bc she's the hottest woman and best sex he's ever had. No thanks tho. 

Mark- God he's so intense and all in like tunnel vision with his mission of getting married he sees what he wants to see. At 24 he's figured out all of life and no one can tell him otherwise omg he's gonna see how that's gonna backfire and say what you will about Jessica but she's right to look at him as a red flag."

LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fjx3pj0,t1_fjw40w3,1583655279.0,Maybe she means you've had a Barnett in your life. And I think you're right I don't think the game was to strongly hint that you'd marry more than one person
