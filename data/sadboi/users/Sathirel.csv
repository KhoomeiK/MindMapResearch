With the emergency of reducing GHG emissions, I'm more and more thinking about acquiring an electric car.

However, I can't buy new because they're simply not affordable. I have a maximum budget of 12k (CAD) and must include taxes. I also live in an appartment with a simple outdoor outlet. 

Can I get an affordable and reliable car for that price?
What should I know?"

Anxiety is a mental health condition. Every time you worry, everytime you feel depressed and you feel like your thoughts ends up making a loophole, it's your anxiety. That's what it does, it makes you feel stuck.

I know that people don't like being told what to do. If you feel stuck and feel like you want to end your life, please seek for professional help. I know it might feel... Artificial, cold maybe and that what you need is a friend to talk to, but I see a psychologist and she helps me every week and believe me, she really helps. She knows what to look for and she has strategies to take you out of these kind of thoughts. Your brain is also a very complex organism controled by a plattera of chemicals. Maybe you feel this way because you have a lower level of serotonin (I suggest you read about it)."

I'm currently seeing a psychologist, I'm having social anxiety obviously, but when I feel that I can't be judged, I really open up. She told me a good idea would be to meet people who also has social anxiety and try to find some people that likes the same things as me. If you have certain interests, try to find some Facebook event near you. Just go and maybe you will find some people to talk to or get talked to. This is exactly what I am going to do this weekend. :) and if it's too much for you, try to attend some conference?"

However, I have a very strange problem.

I downloaded back Skyrim and tested it with my save game and it worked like a charm. Everything was fine. So I plugged the microSD back to reformat it, because there is clearly an issue with it. Reformatting didn't work, I have the error code 2019-0390. Then I removed the microSD card, I don't how to resolve this and now Skyrim in the internal memory is Gone!!! I downloaded it yesterday evening and went to bed, this morning it wasn't there and didn't know what happened. Downloaded it again this morning, tested it and worked and now gone again, but only Skyrim. My other games are there. 

I only take care of my things, never dropped my switch on the floor, all these problems are very sudden and never happened before..."
