xxfitness,fr4v42c,t3_gmof1u,1589897455.0,"I highly recommend a book on this called ""Why We Sleep."" Sleep is SO much more than for physical recovery. Reading that was a game-changer for me. But if you want the relevant TL;DR:

* Stick to a normal sleep schedule. Try to sleep and wake up at the same time as often as possible. Same with naps.
* Limit alcohol, caffeine, and sugar
* Smaller meals at nighttime
* Avoid napping after 3pm 
* Give yourself 1 hour before bed to relax (dim lights, turn off any screens, meditate)
* Dark, cool bedroom. Move phones and clocks away from your bedside
* If you can't stay asleep at night, get up and do something relaxing. For me, I sit in a cozy chair and read a book. I wouldn't recommend any screen usage at this time though
* Go outside for at least 30 minutes a day, esp when it's sunny

Edibles have also helped me in the past to stay asleep but ofc not everyone can utilize this tip. And it may lead to more snacking than snoozing"

3. Run steep hills. Less people there
4. Wear a mask if you walk and run.
5. Most important: Practice mindfulness. Focus on your body, breath and steps. Simply observe. Or observe your surroundings. Find wonder in the little things like the squirrels or the clouds. Focusing on my breath alone gives me less anxiety and better runs
