So lower the nicotine content or frequency over 1-3 weeks, plan to run out and don't buy any juice/pods, then put the vape somewhere inconvenient and try to forget about it. Once you get used to just puffing it whenever you want it's hard to stop because it becomes an automatic response to stress, boredom or mood/alertness management

I got kind of confused at your description of use. A couple hits with friends or are you dependant? A couple hits every once in awhile won't have you withdrawing. Even if you took just a 2-3 puffs a day it wouldn't cause much change to nicotinic receptors which is what causes dependance.
