4kTV,fpc8zm8,t1_fpbf3yr,1588491738.0,"You are right, donâ€˜t listen to the person above, itâ€˜s just an US shill spoiled by the glorious TCLs and Vizios we donâ€˜t get in the EU.

Our TCLs are completely different and not comparable. The only options in this price range are LG, Samsung and Sony. Philips and Hisense are also there, but not much is known about those (not many reviews). And LG and Sony are IPS, so Samsung is better.

Edit: Found a good source to check for lesser known TVs: displaydb.com"
4kTV,fpc8d71,t3_gcfs2q,1588491098.0,"People here forget that the EU market is completely different from the US market. TCLs are completely different, Vizio doesnâ€˜t even exist, and Sony in this price range are IPS.

The RU8000 only gets so much hate because US. In the EU I think itâ€˜s a pretty complelling option for a budget TV, especially because it depreciated so much. But for the same price you can find the 55in variant, so Iâ€˜d go with the 55RU8000. Itâ€˜s pretty good for gaming.

One last thing, definitely try to get the 55in because that has a 120Hz panel compared to 60Hz on the 49in. It doesnâ€™t have HDMI 2.1, so if you want to buy a next gen console like PS5 and Xbox Series X, Iâ€˜d wait for a 2020 or 2021 TV, to get 4K@120Hz support with HDMI 2.1. Else the 55RU8000.

4kTV,fpc7pq7,t3_gcm1nc,1588490439.0,75 is just becoming mainstream now. 82 is probably still quite a price jump (except for the 82in RU 8000 in Europe which is dirt cheap). Iâ€˜d go 75in for now.

After OLEDs became popular, they added a section â€žPermanent burn-in riskâ€œ which gives a straight-up 10 points to every LCD TV and 2.0 points to OLED."

My use case is watching TV shows with news and cartoons, not movies. And bonus: The bigger mid range LCD will be cheaper."

Price is a viable argument, sound quality may be if you want to sacrifice all other factors for 1% better sound quality, but convenience definitely goes to wireless."
