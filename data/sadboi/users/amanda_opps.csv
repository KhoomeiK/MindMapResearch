BravoRealHousewives,fqxdox5,t3_glfuu9,1589730596.0,"Kyle is one of those housewives that I‚Äôm constantly shifting my feeling for, because for me she doesn‚Äôt really inspire strong feelings one way or another. She isn‚Äôt like Eileen, who I always love, or Luann who I usually can‚Äôt stand. Most of the time I tend to fall to kind of passively not liking Kyle because she comes across as inauthentic. She doesn‚Äôt own the fact that she can be EXTREMELY nasty at times: game night in season 2, the behind-the-scenes view of what happened with Kim and the limo in season 1, and her treatment of LVP in season 9. It really seems like she just tries to cover her nastiness with family scenes, or scenes of her being corny, but it doesn‚Äôt work. Viewers remember."

vanderpumprules,fq8eedn,t1_ffxfywp,1589164322.0,Sometimes it‚Äôs difficult for reality tv fans to acknowledge two things can exist at the same time. Sandoval‚Äôs texts were inappropriate and ridiculous. Stassi was being super shady by going to everyone except Sandoval. It‚Äôs not that difficult.

I can‚Äôt agree about the ultimatum: I don‚Äôt think that was okay, and I‚Äôd go so far as to say that most ultimatums are inappropriate. However, Schwartz is responsible for his behavior, and he can‚Äôt use the ultimatum as a way to argue and demean Katie."
