bipolar,flxrh7g,t1_fltd0w8,1585588438.0,for the people like us I'm hoping for a quick return to \*normal\*
bipolar,fi70abb,t3_f6rqu3,1582211552.0,you are 10000% right.  i also HATE when people try to tell me they know more about this than me and how my body responds to meds like no ive been dealing with this all my life if you aren't my doctors shut up and listen
bipolar2,ffe3bs9,t3_esyfj0,1579835606.0,I take it in the morning so the crash doesn't hit till 5 after my day is mostly done and until I've found something better I've made peace with needing a nap around 6/7
depression,ffe1svw,t3_et1nd2,1579834477.0,im gonna do it....but im gonna complain the whole time
bipolar,ffe100f,t1_ffckbz9,1579833899.0,:/ yeah I knew better before but I've been scared straight. I just wanna be a regular kid sometimes
bipolar,ffe0pb7,t1_ffcyl6g,1579833683.0,pretty sure its the brownie since my pill doc had me on a slow increase and I've never had symptoms like this before (Im also still on a very low dose @ 100mg)
depression,fe9i72t,t3_enrs4c,1578937759.0,"YES!! Literally after being diagnosed my lizard brain was like ' no you're not youre faking it// go off your meds to prove it"" and I was like woah okay there. I think also part of it is needing to find your mind tribe. I don't talk to everyone about whats going on because not everyone has the emotional intelligence or wants to even give creedence to the nuances of whats going on. I think feeling guilty also has a lot to do with how people with mental illnesses are portrayed as being attention seeking or dramatic"
bipolar2,fe96lo6,t3_eo5h6a,1578934845.0,I was diagnosed with GAD and depression fall of 2017 and that was treated with Prozac. It took the edge off and made life somewhat easier but there came a point where it hurt to breathe i didn't want to live. The prozac def helped but i 100% needed something additional  I thought how low I could get so fast  was a symptom of something else and was diagnosed BP three weeks ago but I've been in treatment for about 3 years now
bipolar2,fdljvsd,t3_elu2h8,1578525669.0,"20mg Prozac, 100mg Lamictal and .5-1 mg of Xanax as needed. The first week of Prozac saved my life but it only brought me so far and after a year 1/2 on that I had another episode and that when the Lamictal was added. It's been short with Lamictal but I can do things now so fingers crossed its up from here."
bipolar2,fdlixpw,t3_elqehu,1578525033.0,I ended my first semester back at school after hospitalization and 6 months away on a high note and finally found some answers to why my meds appeared to no longer be working; I was able to get out of bed without thinking about it :)
