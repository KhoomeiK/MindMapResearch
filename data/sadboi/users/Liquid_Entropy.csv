BipolarReddit,fr32ffu,t1_fr317wv,1589848583.0,Goodluck on your endeavors
BipolarReddit,fr3116o,t1_fr30v3m,1589847788.0,Not a problem.  I still use it lightly to help me sleep at night. But nowhere near as much as previous.
BipolarReddit,fr30pvr,t3_gmc8bq,1589847610.0,"As I said in the other thread earlier, daily constant use has made my psychotic to the point of wanting to kill others and myself.  I even attempted not to long ago because of the psychosis."
BipolarReddit,fr2ccpb,t3_gltk83,1589834855.0,"I'm a big gamer as well but when depression hits I dont really game much.  I cant focus on it or after a couple hours, like you state, I lose intrest.  Perhaps this is a sign of depression and losing interest in activities?"
BipolarReddit,fr2bcy4,t1_fr24zmo,1589834370.0,Yeah like it used to be gone but now it just leads to dark places if I overdo it
BipolarReddit,fr1ipei,t3_gm3rzk,1589820414.0,"Yeah so I was a fan of smoking all day every day to help cope with my mania and depression.  Recently, all this has done is escalated my psychosis, to the point of wanting to kill others or trying to kill myself. I have really cut back recently to use it only to help me fall asleep and I am going to try and keep using it in a limited fashion."
BipolarReddit,fr1hrn4,t1_fr15bxe,1589819951.0,"I'm in the same boat, and it sucks.  But we just have to keep going."
BipolarReddit,fqo4acg,t1_fqmrwu6,1589507274.0,"I kinda agree with you, to be honest."
BipolarReddit,fq88kue,t3_gh98xq,1589160687.0,I've had a hard time with meds.  I've never given them a chance to work for me. But I've heard stories of people being almost symptom free on the right ones.
BipolarReddit,fq8816u,t3_ghdv6c,1589160366.0,About 22-23 but I've had a long break of stability off meds from then until 27-28 where I've been hospitalized like 7 times in those 2 years.  So its really kicking my ass right now.
BipolarReddit,fq6nkrj,t1_fq3t0u4,1589134978.0,I agree. I think it's even to taboo to talk about it on here. But I get them all the same
BipolarReddit,fosa837,t3_g981un,1588026797.0,I was on 20mg for a manic episode and it did nothing for me
BipolarReddit,forraxp,t3_g92den,1588017138.0,"I am finding php very unhelpful.  I went in manic, they eventually hospitalized me, came out depressed and I've been spiraling downwards ever since.  All the while the doctor has a wait and see attitude.  

I would love to discharge and quit these useless meds, but my girlfriend gave me a ultimatum of do all this or shes gone."
BipolarReddit,foq84ry,t3_g8wgl5,1587986327.0,Yes I can relate.  I talked to my doctor and he prescribed some meds to help cope with it.
BipolarReddit,fonw4jy,t3_g8axmv,1587927633.0,I feel so alone as well. Alone in the struggle of this illness that is drowning me.
BipolarReddit,fonj2gt,t1_fon3n8k,1587920451.0,I told my doc on friday in php and he didnt seem to concerned about it
BipolarReddit,folctvo,t1_fokysxx,1587859506.0,Yeah I tried to talk to my doctor and he kinda dismissed it.
BipolarReddit,fola7p6,t1_fol3sc8,1587857969.0,"Yeah mine are telling me how worthless I am, how meaningless I am, how much I'm a burden, etc"
BipolarReddit,fola0gr,t1_fokvwrh,1587857853.0,Like I can hear it like someone talking
BipolarReddit,foksgk4,t1_foks9ry,1587848078.0,Thank you.  I'm glad someone has a relatable experience.
BipolarReddit,fohr79c,t3_g7arxc,1587771079.0,"You dont want a manic episode.  I've hard like 5.  They all start fun and pleasurable but quickly go to violent, delusional, and psychotic.  

I would not suggest trying to have one.  They are ruining everything I'm working to achieve."
BipolarReddit,fohcen5,t1_fogoio1,1587763621.0,I feel attacked by this message lol
BipolarReddit,fof7rqv,t3_g76rzb,1587728876.0,I smoke daily multiple times a day.  Probably not good for my overall mood but its a hell of a coping mechanism.
BipolarReddit,fodxv48,t1_fodxaon,1587692197.0,"I just feel like those in my life I'm just a burden to.  A hindrance in one way or another.  Without me here, it would no longer be that way."
BipolarReddit,fodpjye,t1_fodn0ow,1587687691.0,Cycles can maybe take months.  I was manic for like 2 months and then have been in and out of hospitals and programs since then
BipolarReddit,fod81ue,t1_focw9oh,1587681439.0,"I've also recently came down for a manic episode into a dark depression and everything I do is so slow and almost lethargic.  I can hardly type out the words here.

I've also given thought to injectable medicine because I too go off my meds alot.  I've just never trusted to doctor enough."
BipolarReddit,fo8trl3,t3_g64tee,1587603669.0,"My diagnosis kept up over the years fRom NOS, type 2, then type 1 with psychotic features.  It seems like it gets worse and worse"
BipolarReddit,fo8smpn,t1_fo8ppnd,1587602996.0,"I have no internal motivation to take them.  I like the highes, not the psychosis. The only reason I'm taking them and attending a php is because my girlfriend gave me a ultimatum to do it or shes gone"
BipolarReddit,fo8d9c0,t3_g6amop,1587594353.0,I feel like the opposite.  They rip the energy joy and good parts of mania and leave me just a man staring at a void inside me.
BipolarReddit,fo5a1ax,t1_fo56pof,1587520782.0,I'm my experience they just throw you on some meds and keep you there even if it's not working.  Taking 0 feedback at all and something even scolding you
BipolarReddit,fo4pr70,t3_g5p7vv,1587508860.0,I have a 6 year relationship.  She wanted to break up sunday and I was able to talk her out of it but I'm hanging on by a thread.  She told me I need to work on myself before she would try to help me.
BipolarReddit,fo4p3w2,t3_g5jr0y,1587508502.0,Almost all doctors I have met sit in their ivory towers and rain drugs down on me with no  care if they are working or not.
BipolarReddit,fo4kd5v,t3_g5n4v7,1587506004.0,"Mine is because I hate the meds and the way they feel and start remembering the good times I'd mainis (the ramp up), so its like hey I'm not bipolar this isnt a problem.  No matter how many hospitalizations I always come to this"
BipolarReddit,fo19bp1,t1_fo18e24,1587428407.0,"No I take depakote and geodon, welbutrin."
BipolarReddit,fo0sdky,t1_fo03dre,1587418876.0,Sound just like the doctors lol. I dont mean that in a bad way.
BipolarReddit,fo0q24z,t1_fnzlgno,1587417663.0,That's a hard realization.
BipolarReddit,fnzt3bv,t1_fnzchrz,1587400278.0,"I have a plan too.  If the girlfriend pulls the trigger and leaves me, that's going to be it for me.

I started my latest med 3 weeks ago. Most inpatient tho."
BipolarReddit,fnz91wz,t1_fnz8o4n,1587389090.0,I talk to them every day and just get a let's wait and see approach.  It just feels so hopeless
BipolarReddit,fnz5ztp,t1_fnz5pa9,1587386964.0,Yes.  I don't want to be psychotic again. I dont think my relationship will handle another psychotic episode
BipolarReddit,fnxw2ck,t1_fnxvpfa,1587347574.0,3 weeks for the welbutrin and longer for the depakote and geodon.
BipolarReddit,fnxc5sv,t1_fnxb5fh,1587335667.0,Maybe.  I've been on and off so many meds now it's hard to say if any work.  Thanks for taking the time out to talk to me.
BipolarReddit,fnx8bsr,t1_fnwkurl,1587333478.0,"I guess I need to remember I'm doing it for us, like you said.  It's still hard to accept that she doesnt accept me as is and wants me to be a medicated version of myself"
BipolarReddit,fnx71la,t1_fnx6xi5,1587332744.0,"Not while I am in program, unfortunately."
BipolarReddit,fnx5i7j,t1_fnx3fve,1587331874.0,I've tried to talk to my doctor damn near every day (in a php program)  and I'm just told to wait it out and see.
BipolarReddit,fnx5fbg,t1_fnwzhpl,1587331830.0,Yeah that's a good point.  My girlfriend just tried to break up with me over it and I managed to salvage it. But I dont have any chances left
BipolarReddit,fnx5840,t1_fnwxi8f,1587331717.0,I asked my doctor multiple times that something is wrong and I need to switch.  I just got told I need to give it more time to work
BipolarReddit,fnwd0eu,t1_fnw6gj8,1587316032.0,It's hard to remember that when I feel so terrible.  So depressed
BipolarReddit,fnwcymt,t1_fnw13u3,1587316004.0,That's exactly how I feel
BipolarReddit,fnr01np,t3_g32b3e,1587176054.0,I enjoy it like every other weekend on I'm medicated. I cant get away from the feeling
BipolarReddit,fnerm97,t3_g14ky5,1586894611.0,"I feel like meds have ripped a void in me.  The grey feeling, I can relate.  I don't know if this is just baseline or I'm depressed now."
BipolarReddit,fnd7dc2,t3_g0x25q,1586861579.0,All the time.  Hence why I'm always quitting my meds and ending up hospitalized
BipolarReddit,fnbuv79,t3_g0ud0z,1586822784.0,"I've experienced both at different time.  Also, hypomania has also been a part of my Manias ramp up"
BipolarReddit,fnbet5f,t3_g0mbir,1586814264.0,"I felt like I could control it. Like I could just not give in.  That I was healed. 5 hospital stays, on the verge of losing everything, and a php later, I'm beginning to realize that isnt true.  Because I just become manic and delusional again and again. The symptoms always feel so real, even when I know I have bipolar. I lose all insight.  

It's a tough pill (or pills) to swallow but I'm beginning to accept I need help managing my life. I cant fight this illness. 

Will I be episode free forever?  Probably not.  Chances are I'll have another one because ive had like 5 now.  I'm still trying to find meds that work. I'm currently super depressed after a manic episode. But unless I want to keep ruining my life further, I need to accept I cant control the illness."
BipolarReddit,fn4t6dy,t3_fzjztm,1586648425.0,"I've been on it before. It did nothing for me.  But I see alot of people on here praise it, so your experience may be different. I'm type 1 if it makes a difference"
BipolarReddit,fmy8ndi,t3_fxw02e,1586480505.0,Just watched it.  Was good thanks for the suggestion.
BipolarReddit,fmtx9pb,t3_fwzoad,1586380641.0,"Shrooms, Lucy, DXM.  Most of this was pre diagnosis. Now I stick to occasional lucy."
BipolarReddit,fmtwxzo,t3_fx6qpx,1586380475.0,"I have been in a partial program for 3 weeks and had a inpatient stay for 4 days 2 weekends ago. 

Before all this happened, I was inpatient for awhile.  So it's been a rough couple months."
BipolarReddit,fmtvg67,t1_fmtvcw7,1586379703.0,Nah
BipolarReddit,fmtv2qd,t3_fxdmv4,1586379516.0,"I dropped last week and was fine. 7/10 trip report. Yes I'm on medications. I plan to drop again this weekend actually. 

As for molly, I had to cut that out of my life awhile back because it was becoming a huge habit, so I have no input to give.

This is not a endorsement nor a suggestion. Only my experience."
BipolarReddit,fmn302y,t3_fw9q3f,1586217131.0,Intresting.  I took accutane as a teen. I'll have to look into this.
BipolarReddit,fmmovi1,t3_fw6xu5,1586209267.0,"I feel like I'm lost in life. Endlessly cycling. And when I'm depressed, it's like in staring at a void and can find nothing pleasurable or direction for myself.  So I can definitely relate to you there."
BipolarReddit,fmmafu0,t1_fmlpux4,1586201750.0,Yes
BipolarReddit,fmlp5uc,t3_fvx7q7,1586190656.0,I'll be the odd man out and say that I dropped Friday with no issues. But I'm not saying it's the healthy option.
BipolarReddit,fmjfm5u,t3_fvn2nq,1586129351.0,I had no interaction when I was on abilify
BipolarReddit,fmixuc4,t3_fvhtxv,1586119091.0,"MDMA is a amazing experience. Weed has served me well over the years and I can't say its caused any psychosis.  When I'm in psychosis, I find it helps slow things down a little but doesnt make any of it go aw away.

I just dropped some Lucy friday and felt absolutely amazing and in touch with myself."
BipolarReddit,fmiwzr3,t1_fmint3a,1586118608.0,That's a great idea. When I find some energy to get off this bed I will do that.  Thank you
BipolarReddit,fmijyvj,t1_fmij5pl,1586111085.0,"Yeah I know your right now, it's when I'm not in a episode for a little that I get to questioning it."
BipolarReddit,fmidfhv,t3_fvgtv8,1586107378.0,"Sometimes I question my diagnosis for sure. This is definitely part of the reason.  Like in my head I rationalize everything onto why it's okay, why I'm not really sick, and that doctors over diagnosis the illness."
BipolarReddit,fmg0qvc,t1_fmeztjh,1586038866.0,Yeah I'm on depakote and geodon
BipolarReddit,fmezp39,t1_fmexb91,1586016983.0,I hope they do eventually work.  Im on such a low dose of welbutrin I dont think it's going to help.  They are talking about virtulizing all the php I'm in and that makes me feel even worse.
BipolarReddit,fmay12i,t1_fm9ttyp,1585912264.0,Yeah the ward I was at was like super downsized and they rushed people out too. So it's not just you
BipolarReddit,fm9htwg,t3_ftslfq,1585869036.0,This sub has helped me multiple times when I was in episodes.  The people here seem just welcoming and helpful.
BipolarReddit,fm9hesw,t3_fttpbb,1585868792.0,"I was on 20mg a day.  It didnt work for me and they swaped me to geodon.  I found that, while it did keep the psychosis away, it didnt stop the mania."
BipolarReddit,fm9h21c,t3_ftuy5m,1585868587.0,I also just got out of the hospital extremely quickly. Maybe 72 hours.  I know I wasnt ready but they wanted me back into php asap
BipolarReddit,flm4kia,t1_fllsxf3,1585274423.0,"It's so weird how the illness manifests in different people. I dont have a problem with racing speech, just racing thoughts.  I try to keep it all bottled up and not just talk, so to speak."

Luckily I got into a php and the doctor there realized how shit the meds were working for me and we are transitioning to depakote and geodon, as well as trazodone foe sleep instead of ambien.  I dont trust my outside doctor anymore."
gmu,fld1zhu,t1_flbx30v,1585054400.0,Facts
BipolarReddit,fl7pa96,t3_fn5822,1584906487.0,I feel this way sometimes.  Like being stable is boring. I end up going off meds and having a episode. Go to the hospital and get back on meds.  Rinse and repeat. I'm currently in a php after a inpatient stay because I went off my meds.  Because I felt fine and life felt boring.
gmu,fkydrip,t1_fky60tq,1584646728.0,Guess I gotta sugar coat it.
gmu,fkxqajj,t3_fla0fo,1584633335.0,I said the same thing last week and got labeled toxic.
BipolarReddit,fkvp4ao,t1_fkvoghh,1584573785.0,"Oh no it's no caused by a med change. The med change is a response to it.  

I'm wishing the best for you!"
BipolarReddit,fkvnixd,t3_fkz086,1584572846.0,"I feel the same way right now. My doctor changed my anti psychotic to a different one to see if it will help. Going from abilify to Invegra. I've never tried it so we will see how it goes.  The doctor said it wouldnt cause significant weight gain so that is good.  Might of been a lie though. 

I also personally find smoking weed to help slow my thoughts right now.  While sober, it feels like I'm failing to swim in a raging stream, after smoking I feel like I can sit on the bank of the shore and watch the stream flow by."
BipolarReddit,fkuu4um,t1_fkus741,1584556179.0,Currently they are lasting until the hospital lol.  This current one is coming on for like a month now.  In between I have a couple months. If I'm lucky.
BipolarReddit,fkrj9bo,t1_fkrj1az,1584469952.0,Yeah they actually thought I was type 2 when I was younger because of the depression.  Now there is no question I'm type 1.  I get mostly manic with mild depressions.
BipolarReddit,fkriy5c,t1_fkrhy7u,1584469779.0,I also went from heavy depression to just strait manias too
BipolarReddit,fkrg4z0,t3_fk994e,1584468205.0,Like 6 years now. But I was super stable off meds for like 4 years.  Now things keep falling apart. Type 1
