This was even [confirmed](https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/the-trust-factor/) by Valve themselves. Lately however this doesn't seem to be the case anymore since the trust factor reset in last summer. That's why there has been way more cheaters recently too. Valve can also suspend the account altogether.

> Q: I play CS:GO on a Steam account that I acquired from someone else (rather than creating it myself on steampowered.com). Could this explain the poor experience that I am having?
A: Yes. When you acquire a premade Steam account then you also acquire that Steam account’s Trust Factor. Additionally, acquired accounts commonly have a very low Trust Factor. Don’t acquire accounts from other users."
GlobalOffensive,fr1dhkr,t1_fr1b9fg,1589817799.0,"I think the problem is that OW is just 98% filled with non-Prime cases, sometimes even from China and new rank 2 accounts so ""closet"" cheaters/semi-ragers rarely get into the OW pool anymore and this has been happening since F2P. Valve needs to make a filter for non-Prime/Prime cases and fix the trust system again like how it worked in 2018.

I catched one of these semi-ragers in OW recently, even though it's evident that they are very fishy, they just aren't blatant enough to not get banned for a long time. My suspect once went ""a little"" too blatant with walls, but there wasn't really anything else 100% blatant I could convict for and last time I checked he or nor his friends are still not banned, also lower ranked OW investigators may not even notice anything unusual in their gameplay in the first place. 

Sometimes not even the cheater that only uses scout/dgl with 95% HS rate destroying the whole server gets OW banned in my cases, this is also a problem. 

I hope this means Valve will do an another huge VAC wave soon or something and fix the trust factor."

Presumably most of these are trade banned ex-gambling site bots but still that feels just fucked up to see somebody cheating on such accounts anyway.

They have been somehow ruining high trust factor SMFC/Global games since ever Valve ""reset"" the trust factor system last summer, just way more so during the quarantine and  they are ""semi-raging"" so they aren't even 100% blatant in overwatch cases. Eugh. No MM for a while."

GlobalOffensive,fqm7z94,t3_gjdfja,1589473047.0,"Since 2015, I was starting to realize that I suffer from depression and general anxiety/social anxiety, possibly even autism/aspergers (partly diagnosed, but feels like misdiagnose) and although it wasn't too bad at first glance, I played with my friends often and so on. But eventually my real life environment was becoming worse and worse because of some things and so it has impacted my anxiety and social skills as well to the point where I was afraid to even socialize online for a while.

This was becoming more of a problem since my online CS friends eventually quit playing after we all reached Global Elite in 2015 and this got me to stick to soloqueuing for a very long time and I would still kind of do callouts sometimes, especially in key rounds/moments but I was definitely not as confident anymore to communicate.

Overtime, I started trying to accept myself and worked on the other sides of my gameplay and of course social skills. This was also much worse because I happen to be Russian and well, it feels much harder to be noticed and accepted by others here to find new LEM-Global friends because of that and I also struggle playing with other Russians myself a lot, I'm not like them at all and infact, my English is much more fluent IRL than Russian. Getting mental help is also difficult here but I didn't give up.

I didn't struggle as much anymore and I easily got back to LEM in early 2017 but I was stuck there for a very long time and feel like I could had been Supreme/Global much quicker if I at least queued up with one friend and played way more often than just 3-4 games a month. I started to communicate more awhile ago too and it felt such a win to me and a month ago I finally soloqueued to Global by playing more often and communicating and it felt very good.

There's also an MW2/3 exploit where you can prevent anybody from leaving the server other than ending the game process through Task Manager so the players would be trapped getting constantly aimbotted on for example and messing up/resetting your level.

I used to get a lot of red trust warnings for others during 2018, then at one point last year, something changed in the trust system and warnings have been showing up much more less, and now I'm the one that's occasionally showing as red trust as well and MM became a huge hackfest again like it's 2013-2016.

I really don't understand why he did that, OW investigators don't see anything other than blatant griefing and the cheating wasn't really visible because of the teamkilling. He could had just left the game or played until the end and nothing would had happened, these kind of blatant cheater games end pretty quickly in a 16-0 anyway.

If they have an ""edgy/depressed-looking"" profile with short or similar ""unique"" steamids and a lot of fake commends like showed in the video, it's certain they're cheaters and they are proud enough to upload their games to csgostats with their bullshit 98% winrates and winning every single game.

This needs to be in the frontpage for Valve to ""hopefully"" notice this and to be discussed about... I always keep questioning why do I keep playing this game, especially MM for the past years.

The worst weird thing is that they almost all had pretty decent accounts this time and have been cheating for years at Global while dropping crazy 50-60 bombs on their screenshots, only one of them got banned to this day... 

Also the amount of blatant 5man cheat lobbies is insane now and they somehow are able to bypass trust factor to queue up against legit players, and even trashtalk them as well and having the nerves to call them cheaters when they get outplayed and talk like it's a HvH server.

It also took me 2 years to rankup to Supreme from consistent LEM because I kept facing a lot of blatant cheaters during red trust last year and after a few months, my trust recovered and was able to win often again, also was quite a bit unlucky a few times with soloQ team randomness and faceit level 10 enemies and didn't play as often before to rankup when I still had high trust.

Surprisely, it was much easier to rankup to Global few days ago in just 20 games, probably due to all the cheater losses being removed and just rarely getting cheaters in high trust. My last games were against blatant aimbotters that had decent accounts this time and they literally cheated since 2016 on the same accounts and one of them is still not banned somehow.

Most of the cheated games were in 2017, long before Trust Factor, since then the amount of banned games significantly dropped and I barely saw any cheaters in 2018, until my TF was randomly red in around April 2019 and almost every single game would be against blatant cheaters who would get banned after a few days. 

This would happen for months until I emailed Valve about my TF and they fixed my Trust and my games were much cleaner again, but there would still be occasionally people that would get banned after a few months. Since January I haven't seen any cheaters again for months until a few days ago.

It just makes me furious that there are so many people that at least tried to cheat before/after playing with me, and that's just the ones that got caught doing so, I didn't even suspect most of them, so maybe they didn't cheat yet during my games, some of them were just bottomfraggers in either team.

While I very doubt this will be an actual thing, but cheat developers might find CSGO-specific exploits to safely inject their cheats without any traditional DLL injection methods or so on and thus be just 100% invincible to VAC.

I just hope the Trust Factor is server-sided and isn't included in the branch, as it's the only one efficient thing that kind of mitigates cheating, not like cheaters found ways to get to high Trust Factor with legit players lately. TF2 hasn't been updated in a longer time and is way more vulnerable though. 

Interesting if Valve is gonna be forced to work on the Source 2 port quicker now and how they'll react to the whole situation, like back when HL2 and the whole Source Engine source code was leaked in 2003, I'm sure they are gonna be pissed off, especially about the CS:GO code."

VACsucks,fnqheo1,t3_g1wsrt,1587164657.0,"I cheated in CoD: MW2, MW3, CS 1.6, Source and very briefly CS:GO during 2007-2015. 

I randomly stumbled across a CS:S public cheat on the internet in 2007 and as a little 8 year old kid, I was naive and curious on what is that and I downloaded it. I was quite hooked already enough and for a while, I actually ""enjoyed"" rage cheating in servers, after sometime I discovered HvH servers and I enjoyed that way more than cheating against legit players, even though back then all I had were public cheats and would get destroyed by private cheats often.

Eventually somehow, I got involved into the cheating community, I was making my way there, even though I was acting kind of immature in the community sometimes. I friended this one guy that already knew a few popular cheaters that had a lot of private cheats and some cheat developers, he also always wanted to know how cheats worked, how they are coded and so on, so we both went on learning coding and reverse engineering. I never could get well into coding at that time yet.

We would sometimes hop in some servers, especially DM ones and cheat until everyone leaves/goes spec or we get banned by admins, we mostly only played HvH servers as well against each other and other long-time cheaters.

I was getting bored of cheating and realized it ruins other's games, so since around summer 2011 I started to play legit actively, even though I was still mostly hanging around with the same cheating friends everyday online and I still was lurking in the cheating community. Some of my IRL CS school friends were also into cheating as well.

I was ""cheat-free"" for about 2 years, until in March 2013, my friend picked up MW3 and he started cheating the hell in it with a private cheat, which we both knew the developer pretty well for years. Because I hated CoD on PC since MW2, I thought it'd be cool to mess around in MW3 with my friend together, but I promised I would never ever cheat in CS or Valve games anymore, I still cheated in CS:GO together regardless with my friend during May 2013's free weekend because the game was completely different and very shitty back then and we didn't really mind it, I still never cheated in 1.6/Source anymore.

Since we played mostly only Ground War which is a 18 player gamemode, we would actually face a lot of other rage cheaters as well and usually defeat them, but eventually we came across more advanced cheats and would lose. Sometimes there would be even like 6-7 cheaters in one game and you'd see almost the same cheaters everyday fighting each other. It was really weird and kind of fun at the same time. 

I also quit cheating in CoD in summer 2014 because I was getting into CS:GO again, I really liked the 5v5 ranked MM mode and I was having fun learning how to properly play CS. Everything was going perfectly for about almost a year, I was improving a lot and I ranked up to DMG/LE in early 2015, but I started to come across blatant rage cheaters and wallers on new accounts often and it really put off my game again. 

At this point, I was being frustrated by the fact these cheaters would never get banned and for the last time, I decided to do a ""experiment"" on how long it'll take me to get banned and picked up some private ESP cheats, which my friend helped me coding with, bought a throwaway account, which I only played about 10-15 games on it and quit it until almost 2 months later, I randomly decided to try rage cheating in a community DM server and the next day, it was finally VAC'd. 

I hadn't ever cheated in MM since then but I would still mess around with some stuff in Casual/DM, I would stay AFK so I wouldn't ruin anyone's experience again, wasted a few other accounts from that and I completely had quit cheating and the community since then. I still kept talking with some of my cheating friends, even though mostly they would just talk about cheating.

Over the years, that one friend was becoming more and more toxic at me and still keeps enjoying ruining other people's games, I finally cut all contacts with him in April 2018 after almost 8-9 years of talking everyday and as well cut contacts with all the other cheaters and I couldn't had been more proud since it really helped with my declining mental health.

At one point, I was frustrated dealing with blatant cheaters in DMG+ and I had the bad thoughts to try out cheating. I wanted to do a subtle cheating experiment in MM for a few games on some throwaway accounts and see how long it'll take for the VAC/OW ban, which took 2 months.

Needless to say, I've been playing 100% legit in all games since then, cut off contact with all cheating ""friends"" and absolutely regret my cheating past everyday and I still keep thinking of it, what if I had never got involved with the cheating scene. I also worked hard to change my life and personality to make up for my past. I ruined my already low enough chances of going pro, and the fact I ruined some few people's experience makes me sometimes feel shame and depressed, even after 5 years. It could had been all different if it wasn't for that desperate experiment, I deserved it. 

I refuse to ever cheat or befriend cheaters anymore and can't stand them at all now.

I haven't really been able to be that much popular because of that and I'm very lucky to have 2 IRL (best) friends right now, which were from my school.

I legitimately somehow didn't know about Steam support until about a few years later and it took me also a lot of time to finally get my second account back.

This was seemingly the temporary way to try to get rid of ragehackers until Overwatch was implemented. It's also very interesting to see how the cheating situation has dramatically improved since then and even though how it's far more simple to obtain cheats (or even ready source codes) nowadays for anybody now, it very likely ruins their TF along on the way so they mostly play against each other in MM, which is honestly a godbless, they'll certainly get banned at least once in their life and otherwise associate themselves with cheating groups, their ""culture"" and their cheating friends, which most probably also affects the TF.

offmychest,fk73355,t3_fgilzw,1583926195.0,"I'm  very sorry to hear about everything she's had done to you. I've been in a similar spot myself sadly and it's one of the worst experiences indeed. :(

I was a easy target for bullying at school for almost my whole life because I had slightly poor physical coordination since birth from what I suspect aspergers/autism, in 5th grade in this new school I moved to, there were two girls who would defend me from the bullies everytime and report it to our teachers. 

I tried to befriend them and I thought the bullying will stop finally but it wasn't it. After a few months, they suddenly turned against me and admitted that they were just pranking me the entire time and they never had any feelings for me. They were friends with the bullies themselves too. One of the girls almost kicked me in the balls once and it was an awful moment.

Being very lonely and quite naive without any mental support, I kept trying to befriend them because basically everyone else were jerks in the class and they were the only ""decent"" classmates, didn't have anyone else to talk with. They'd talk with me sometimes though as if nothing happened, but drama was quite real sometimes from them and they'd try to kick me out after sometime.

Next year, some few girls joined our class and almost right out of the bat, these girls were interested into me in a stalker way because I was attractive, but then these girls would talk about me how horrible I am apparently and from there, they even tried to force me to go to the toilet mid-class for ""something"", I instantly refused them and they were mad at me and then tried to blackmail me to the teachers about ""harassment"". 

These new girls were also assholes to some other classmates as well so it wasn't just me thing, they'd kept laughing at me and making fun of me whenever they would see me. Another girl wanted to be friends with me but just hated me because all the rumours spreaded about me in class. For the longest time, I was terrified to talk about all of this to my parents or anyone else because they were girls and I can't do anything back against them because of that, teachers also kind of doubted me. 

After a few months when I had enough of bullshit nearly everyday, they made me stay isolated from others with an IEP program and drove me to suicide a few times, I hurt one of these bullies's back and even though their male friend (also used to bully me all the time) hurt me back in the nose, I don't really regret what I did to her and she was only hurt for a few days too. Didn't really stop her from making fun of me with her friends and isolating me though again sadly. 

Also they pretended to be sorry for everything and tried to be friends with me when they heard about my home abuse story and when my grandmother died in Jan 2016 and then dumped me again after a few weeks as expected. I was so glad to finally graduate from highschool too.

It's been all about 5-6 years ago since this whole story now, but I still occasionally remember all of this and how it severely affected my mental health and self-confidence with girls. At least I got into some therapy and found some new girl friends from the other school 4 years ago which were much, much better than them, treated me like a real human and accepted me for who I am, and even helped me deal with some of my mental problems and we plan to go outside again soon. Also had plenty of positive attention from girls in college and was in a relationship once in Sep 2016, albeit it was kind of abusive and it only lasted for 2 weeks. 

I'm still healing from this and improved myself at 21 years old, but I still don't really have that much confidence because I don't have as good social skills and because I'm short at 5'5/5'6 height and I get terrified remembering my hellish past.

Not even talking about some dedicated cheating groups with $1000 skins, steam level 200-300, a lot of coins and etc that blatantly semi-rage in MM for years openly with screenshots and 95% winrates while winning almost every game on csgostats and they are still not banned..

I'm sure Valve is trying to do something about it finally, but they need to sort it out so cheaters can't easily get to high trust factor and start doing VAC waves on paid and some private cheats often again, and don't make it so easy to lower your trust just from low rank/wingman reports.."

My parents just forced her to take birth of me for whatever reasons, as they were against abortion and despised it. She also was taking drugs while being pregnant, that supposedly caused some developmental problems for me when I was younger, specially with speech. I also suspect my short height of 5'5 - 5'7 is also attributed to her being raped and not being ready for a child, as well and taking drugs and the height of the rapist maybe.

Anyhow, she died exactly a year later after my birth because she mistakely overdosed and my family still feels depressed over that, even after 20 years. My grandmother and stepfather chose to raise me, I could've been in a foster care home. My family was full of toxicity and abuse and I suffered from severe depression/anxiety because of constant abuse. My grandmother also died in January 2016 and it made things much, much more worse for me, almost for 3 years.

I was bullied a lot severely almost everyday at school for just being a bit different than the other kids and almost never had any real friends, to the point where I was put in an IEP program so I'd be studying without my classmates until I graduated and this really screwed up my social skills for a long time. I had multiple suicide attempts, but thankfully they all failed. 

I'm 21 now, it took me a long hard time to heal up after everything I've been through, it was much easier when I made a school friend that helped me to make me feel like I also deserve living in this world and have friends, love and etc like everyone else, I also still talk with that person today and we plan on meeting up again soon IRL :3

I still occasionally feel depressed when I remember this whole story with me and my mother and similar stories, because I sadly know firsthand how much does it impact you later mentally for a long time, as well and knowing that I possibly have aspergers/autism but it's been much better than in 2016/2017 or before and I'm proud of being such a survivor :)

Normally if you soloqueue and consistently keep playing with people that have old operation coins, old (2015/2016) service medals with around 500-1000 MM wins, 5/10 year coins, almost never tend to report anybody, then you have a high TF. You can still meet some toxic players though.

Meanwhile on (very) low TF, the game quality is severely much worse and there's blatant cheaters almost every other game with brand new accounts with 1000+ commends, no badges or only loyalty badge and etc, they can get very toxic as well and sometimes it's even straight out HvH. Basically the most type of hell for legit players, think like the old pre-TF non-Prime and you can't have a 'proper' game on low TF at all without either cheating or playing with cheating premades.

Also if you've been tracking your matches on csgostats.gg for quite a while, you can tell that on high TF, [you rarely have any banned matches](https://i.imgur.com/e0KxpbR.png) even after 2-3 years, while on (very) low TF [almost every other game](https://i.imgur.com/DsDIxua.png) tends to have at least 1-2 cheaters banned consistently and it's impossible to rankup with all of these cheaters.

Ahh, when I finally got DSL internet to play HL2 because the CD version still required Steam (still have the 5 CDs somewhere!). I've played CS since around 1.3 or 1.5 WON versions with bots when I was very young. I managed to get my account stolen from me by a Steam ""friend"" in 2007 because I was a dumb young child at the time and still feel crappy about it because it had almost all the Steam games at the time and I didn't know about Steam Support for many years, as well being very despised to play Gmod 10 at the time, even though I didn't have a credit card to get it. I also still remember the good ol' green Steam skin.

I happen to have a 5 digit (day 1) account as my main account now from when steamids were a common thing to flex about, especially in CS when 8 digits would be constantly accused of cheating if they were doing good and weren't ""trustworthy"". Nowadays low steamids mean absolutely nothing practically and are usually bought by CS:GO cheaters for very cheap, also probably come with a very low Trust Factor too. It's also usually easy to tell when somebody (recently) bought an old account like this.

I usually tend to get all nostalgic about the old casual gaming times too when I played a variety of games, nowadays I'm busy with life a lot and don't really have time and/or energy to play and I mostly only play CS:GO nowadays really, TF2 is not really that alive anymore either, especially in EU recently unfortunately."

These guys don't even hide it and are very proud of cheating, even publicly on their profiles and screenshots shamelessly, they even have a lot of pins, skins/knives and operation coins on their accounts, probably bought accounts. I had 8 blatant cheaters literally that game. It was such a horrible experience and Valve does nothing against them other than just try to low their TF and maybe some manual bans very rarely... 

I even reported them to the csgo devs after that game, with the demo link and everything and almost all of them got game banned the next day and presumably my TF was finally back to normal and I get put with legitimate profiles again.

It's gotten much worse since ever Valve ""reset"" TF in August and let cheaters with a lot of recent banned accounts play with legitimate players who have decent accounts, so just like how it was in 2014-2016 before Prime and TF...

Also it's somehow possible to ruin your TF by playing a lot of Wingman or having a huge rank decay, because you get a lot of reports for carrying (from lower ranks and cheaters), as well and getting blocked by some friends... 

Almost never ran into any cheaters at all in 2018/early 2019, until one day I started to get blatant cheaters with new low hour accounts or obviously bought 15+ year old accounts on both teams for 2 months consistently and every single game that period had someone get banned, according to csgostats, whereas it wasn't like that before at all. Not even taking 2-3 weeks breaks from CSGO helped to improve my TF.

I don't know what to expect anymore, Valve really needs to step up and fix this Trust Factor mess so you can't easily get your TF destroyed just from some reports alone and maybe start instabanning clear ragehackers/spinbotters... 

It's such a joke when they make the game F2P and give every account Prime (even without phone number!) and they just only rely on their Trust Factor system. Now any shitty cheater can play against legit players for quite a while again like it's nothing, even if they have a high TF."

Way too underwhelming and it doesn't justify the 15$ at all and waiting 2 years for this. I don't like where Valve is going with the operations now. There's always the great potential for new content but Valve isn't utilizing enough."

lifeisstrange,fg1igya,t3_ew2ths,1580427703.0,"I can't believe it's already been 5 years since LiS! I remember an online Steam friend of mine streamed LiS few times around February and August 2015 and that's how I found out about this game. My first impressions of LiS were already amazing since it seemed to target certain topics such as bullying, depression and suicide, and I felt I had the urge to playthrough it as well since I could relate with the topics in-game. Luckily I seemed to avoid all the major spoilers or I forgot them.

Downloaded episode 1 when it first became free in July 2016 but for some reasons I kept postponing until August 2017, when an other friend of mine talked about it and I instantly started regretting not playing it way back and became quickly in love with it, I've never been way too emotional over something before and I still kinda am today, which makes playing story-based games a bit of struggle with the emotions. 

This game really had a very positive influence on my mental health because of how I could relate to the characters and the main topics, as if I finally had a second chance at life... Never the same anymore.

In a short time, I started joining the LiS community, mostly Discord ones and to be fair, I've never met such a great kind community in all of my time spent on the internet (and real life). 

Started to talk a lot everyday on Discord, even with my social anxiety and others were too nice and understanding, I made a lot of great online friends, which I still talk with some of them, even today after 2 years, also I could vent about my problems in these servers too which was really helpful too and I still listen to the amazeballs LiS soundtrack everyday.

I'm so glad LiS is a thing and even more glad I finally got to have quite the experience to play it after 2 years of delaying it. I wish I could erase my mind and play LiS for the first time again, not sure if I would cry this time. 

I'm probably gonna do an another playthrough for the 5th anniversary very soon, I'm also very interested in the very old discussions before episode 2, 3, and etc, what people thought what the game would continue into.

Thanks Dontnod for this very sweet masterpiece and the mental experience. I'll never forget about LiS, ever, my new one of the best games played."
SuicideWatch,ffozxyx,t3_euag3u,1580083802.0,"My only IRL school friend also shares the same concerns about me. She used to be helping me all the time with my depression and suicidal thoughts about 4 years ago, but then seemingly it got way too much for her to deal with and she cut contacts with me for a while because I was being too annoying, also because of my poor social skills too.

Now we're friends again for almost 2 years kinda, we don't talk that much now but she never responds to some of my little vents/rants about my life anymore ever and she admitted to it too. Maybe it's just way too much burden to deal with miserable waste of oxygen people like me and she doesn't want to feel responsible and guilty forever for my suicide or other repercussions.

Sucks because she was the only person that listened and tried to help me with everything she could, and my family never bothered to help me out with my mental health problems. I wish I had actually successfully choked on my cord during birth or was just aborted and I wouldn't had been a problem for others ever. She gets to live the ""perfect"" life and I barely make it through a day with my loneliness and depression/anxiety."

GlobalOffensive,fdrpiwg,t1_fdr75ej,1578687730.0,"Wingman was always broken because of the very low playerbase tbh, even long before the August TF ""update"". That's why the ranks are also massively screwed up there.

I always would get matched with proper accounts like mine 99% of the time on both teams, meanwhile Wingman mostly had 1 game CS:GO only accounts without even one service medal and of course they're the ones that tend to be ""good"". It seems to have changed recently for me since the Operation because of the Wingman missions but still occasionally get low accounts."
GlobalOffensive,fdrkj0e,t1_fdqufdm,1578685769.0,"Back in pre-CS:GO days, steamID was a known indicator to know if  someone was likely legit or not. If someone had a late 8 digit or so, people would usually call them out for cheating if they did pretty good and wouldn't be trusted by others. 

But then cheaters also started to buy these accounts even that time so it has meant nothing practically since then and nowadays you can easily tell between a very blatantly bought low digit account and a old legit player, unless they bought it a very long time ago or so :D"
GlobalOffensive,fdo0sl8,t3_emc293,1578596768.0,"I used to play a lot of Battlefield 2, CoD4/MW2 multiplayer, TF2, and of course CS 1.6/Source, as well and a lot of other HL1/HL2 mods back in my days. CS:GO became my main game when everyone from 1.6 and Source switched to GO in around 2014 pretty much and has stayed that way for many years.

Now that I finally reached SMFC/Global (soloQ) months ago, I took some break from CS finally and tried out R6S with some friends that constantly play it. It had such a different gameplay from CS and I can't even play it casually either so I would have to spend like 2500 hours just to get half-decent at it and learn/grind all these operators, gamesense and every map, which I simply don't have all the time and skills anymore for that, not sure what I can think of R6S atm. I also keep hearing that the R6S community is more toxic so soloqueuing isn't my priority in that game. 

Other multiplayer games also suffer from P2W microtransactions and etc as well these days like GTA Online and such so I'm not interested in these at all and it still surprises me how CS has much less gameplay problems, compared to other multiplayer games and how easy it is to get into it. Overwatch looks like fun and worth playing though.

Then there's the masterpiece singleplayer games like Bioshock, GTA, Half-Life, Portal, Life is Strange, TWD and etc, which CS has pulled me off from these for quite a time. I usually aim to  playthrough the Half-Life series and GTA:VC/SA every year for a while, I'm also currently playing Black Mesa right now after the Xen release, as well and GTA3 & IV, which I never ever got to play before."

GlobalOffensive,fcsyoau,t3_eip8kr,1577928422.0,"I kinda feel sad at myself over this everytime because I live in Russia (Moscow) myself as well. EU players are ironicly my only hope for somewhat great MM soloQ games, not that I play CS anymore actively anyways.

Even though I'm not anything like the typical Russian players at all, this alone affects me a lot simply because I don't have any EU friends at Supreme/Global rank anymore, and making friends (on top of my social anxiety) would be incredibly difficult because of such stigma about where I live alone and get disowned/ridiculed for that. Not even talking about playing Faceit with my country tag and the LTP button in-game is practically useless to me. My the only IRL friend knows very fluent English like me but she isn't a gamer.

And not only can I confirm most Russians tend to be indeed very toxic and cocky even among themselves, have random casual convos in in-game chat and not really talk in English, there's also way a lot of cheaters among us. 

Because of that and the very rare EU ""trolls"" like you said, I myself don't want to play with other Russians too and strongly do everything to conceal where I come from in-game and speak fluent English all the time, even with 3-4 Russians because they definitely don't speak a word of English afterwards and I wanna cringe inside a bit everytime when I hear Russian toxicity, especially at the EU players. I also vastly prefer the English communities over the Russian ones.

I'd like so soloQ Russians only get other Russians as their teammates/enemies, meanwhile the very few like me can still queue with their EU friends and play against EU players if the other 4 are EU in lobby. Or just the old language preference, which isn't as efficient but maybe could help it a tiny bit. Dunno, something like this.

Also, most Eastern European languages can sound like Russian so it's quite possible to mistake someone for being a Russian when they're not. Sometimes I just wish I was born somewhere else than here honestly."
GlobalOffensive,fcgro1i,t3_eh0q9h,1577643383.0,"I'm now almost certain that reports seem to play a major role in your Trust Factor. Some of my Silver friends recently decided to come back to CS so I had to get one of my old SEM smurf (rank decayed from SMFC/Global in 2015) accounts to play with them and teach.

 I didn't go full tryhard mode on Silvers, I still tried to give them fair chances to win while aiming like a Silver and kept the games close, but sometimes that didn't still work out and I managed to outfrag and therefore get a lot of salty reports, even some my friends were reported a bit. Nobody of us is toxic or anything either and aren't even any tech-savvy for cheats.

The next thing I know after a couple of games over the days all my friends suddenly now get the substantially lower Trust Factor warning about me and our match quality has been so different, we had a semi-blatant cheater in our team in first game, 2nd was clean, and a smurf (maybe cheater as well) in our 3rd game. All with brand new accounts.

We had completely normal and chill games before I got a red Trust Factor except maybe one cheater, considering one of us is completely new to CS and is non-Prime.

I also played few Wingman games with one of them before and he had a yellow slightly lower Trust Factor warning for my main account (16 years, 2k CSGO hours and tons in other games, 330 games, Prime since day one, etc), which later disappeared the next day or so. It really seems that your whole account and Prime doesn't matter and reports seem to overweight all the other factors, which shouldn't be the case. 

I guess this explains the time when I was decayed to LE and destroyed some DMG/LE's and suddenly had blatant new account cheaters every single game on my main account for months despite not doing anything wrong. I used to defend Trust Factor all the time before CS was F2P now it seems a really flawed system for real, it's a real messup. 

At least I finally got my Supreme/Global back and will only be playing MM with my low rank friends for fun now."
VAC_Porn,fce84v3,t1_fbxjgxm,1577617850.0,"Could be a phone or family sharing ban on any VAC-secured game. 

We don't even know if it's a CS:GO ban, even though it's likely it nowadays."
GlobalOffensive,fbrx92v,t3_ee508g,1577047363.0,"Aye, I also had a 939 PC back in the day from circa 2005/2006 to late 2014!

It was an Athlon X2 3800+ w/ stock cooler, 2 GB DDR1 RAM, ATi Radeon X1800 512MB, Windows XP Pro SP2, WD 250GB HDD. It  ran games like GTA:SA, CoD4/MW2, especially Half Life 2/Source Engine games pretty smoothly at the time around 50-80fps which was the normal. I even managed to play CS:GO on it in 2013/2014 at around 30-50fps. 

The only one big game that it didn't run was GTA IV on release cause of it's optimization and even after getting a GTS 250 for it, it still struggled much. The Steam version surprisely ran somewhat better when I tried it in 2014.

The biggest issue with the 939 in 2019 is that it was ditched fastly after some boards heating issues, and all the CPUs for it (afaik) don't support some one instrument to install 8.1/10 64-bit so pretty much it's stuck either on Win7 64-bit forever or 8.1/10 32-bit."

GlobalOffensive,fa0i8ui,t3_e7csk6,1575755455.0,"Finally Valve is doing something against cheaters after what seems forever and just relying on Trust Factor alone this entire time.

Interestingly enough, nobody whom I reported were caught in this VAC wave, not even the 5-man cheating premade I came across and some Gold Nova cheaters at Supreme/Global, yet 1 or 2 players on my team from just one recent match got caught and they were toxic. I only report very shady profiles too if they do insane stuff all the time. Only 2 people were caught in my Wingman matches as well, and they were actually terrible so I didn't suspect them either at all. 

I guess I'm finally back to a high Trust Factor for months, considering how little people got caught in my matches unlike some others and my matches are usually clean now like last year with just 1 or 2 banned matches, but I still sometimes get matched with weird new accounts with just 1 game and 300 hours and they are playing so strange but don't get banned as well, not in this wave either yet and Wingman has been always weird even with a high Trust Factor.

Excellent job from Valve, I hope they'll keep on doing this and improve the Trust Factor system like it was before August again, maybe this VAC wave actually will help improve Trust for most affected people too."
GlobalOffensive,fa0b4xa,t1_f9zql83,1575751985.0,"It doesn't state anything about Trust Factor in the message, but it's still a pretty good assumption that your Trust Factor might likely get hit too."
GlobalOffensive,f9u5a6f,t1_f9t6n9e,1575644625.0,"I did some little investigation here and figured that you played against a known 5-man cheating premade in that game who likely were the ones that got you banned through some weird means. 

They upload every match to csgostats.gg, so I checked some of their recent matches (among your match as well), and it seems some of the likely legit players that had the unfortunate to queue against them also were OW-banned around at the same time as you and also had their ban lifted around today. There was also one cheater banned and they also got the ban lifted somehow. The false bans started happening since around November 25-26 as well and there were some complaints here on the sub that time too, which usually almost never happens otherwise.

My assumptions are that Valve are recently trying to detect some sophisticated aimbots with their VACnet system and updated the AI, and some cheaters figured out a secret exploit to abuse it against actual legitimate players to get them banned. 

Some guy also talked here about an apparent Overwatch bot that works in conjunction with reportbots and if your account is listed in the reportbot list, it'll try to generate a OW case on one of your games and immediately mark your account as guilty.

I wonder if any of the other affected people also played with or against any blatant cheaters, especially the same premade group or similar, seems to be one of the pattern caveats. With the recent Trust Factor reset, it's way more likely to get matched with or against blatant cheaters again now. 

I wonder if cheaters and the F2P update corrupted the TF data somehow, thus causing some few people to suddenly get red TF (happened to me too) so Valve had to reset the system. I'd be wary of playing MM at LEM+ now while this is going on.

Valve really needs to step up and at least admit the false banwave publicly here and explain, patch the exploits and compensate for the affected people, like they did with the MW2 bans almost a decade ago."
