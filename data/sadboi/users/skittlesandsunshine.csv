dietetics,fqzo5ra,t3_glkuak,1589771544.0,"I too am interested in working with mental health, but ideally not ED's, which makes it a bit difficult to navigate finding a nutrition-focused job. I'm in my DI set to graduate in a week and have particular interest in substance abuse, depression, anxiety, trauma, really anything other than ED's. ha 

As a lowly intern ;) I realize I can't add much to the conversation but just want to convey my gratitude for you posting this! If you read any particular interesting research articles, I'd love for you to share!"
dietetics,fpyhfl2,t1_fpveuhw,1589003935.0,"Thank you! That was very helpful, thank you for responding. I’m renewing my membership and have considered joining some DPG’s so I’ll be sure to check those out."

You're not alone my friend."

fatlogic,foxcfvx,t3_g9rsgt,1588139851.0,"If someone in shape said something similar to this, but in the sentiment of loving living in a body that symbolizes hard work and determination, they would get annihilated saying they were fat-shaming. The hypocrisy in that kills me."

AnxietyDepression,fo9ifl5,t3_g646ki,1587620431.0,"Agree with the commenter who said to break it into smaller chunks. When I have depression days and have no motivation, the thing that gets me through the day is to just make very, very small goals. If for you that’s cleaning your apartment, clean for 5 minutes. That’s all you have to do. If you want to continue after that 5 minutes, great, and if you don’t, great. You did it for 5 minutes and that’s longer than 0 minutes."
thebachelor,fo9g0m3,t3_g6cl1d,1587618489.0,Bless you! This is amazing.
