Stand up for yourself if you can. After all they work for you. To make you feel better. They should listen to what you feel and when you are not comfortable with what they are doing. I had to learn to tell them when I was not happy with them. You have that right. Although I am an adult in Holland and I don't know your age or location so maybe I am wrong.

hsp,fajqts5,t3_e98gvq,1576151550.0,"Yeah I get that too. I think it is pretty common for hsp.

And get help if you need it. Call a friend, find a therapist. And don't be hard on yourself. You can do this."
