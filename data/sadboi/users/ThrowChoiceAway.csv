This is your friend right?  I get that you're giving her 3 months, but you should have let them know waaay earlier, they are trying to start up their lives and get all of their baby stuff out of the way to be ready, the lease was probably not on their mind because they were so ""blessed"" to have friends there to help with rent while they can focus on school and being a mom.

You shouldn't have to sacrifice your life because your friend got knocked up, but she was probably under the impression that everyone is staying together.

Personal recommendation, The beard should be fuller in the cheeks, at its current state, the shape of the beard makes your head look bigger than it is by creating a thick border around your jawline, which isn't great when you have a long neck.

If people are saying you look cute then you just need to change your look to be a bit more masculine.  If you can grow a beard, then just maintain a light stubble, nothing unkempt or too long, look at Joe Manganiello for reference ([https://ast.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe\_Manganiello](https://ast.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manganiello)).

&#x200B;

I can tell you're already athletic, you can make yourself look more masculine by focusing your shoulders, chest and lats in the gym to emphasize your V taper, making you look more imposing.  You can check out some exercises here at scoobysworkshop ([https://scoobysworkshop.com/](https://scoobysworkshop.com/)) if you want to work them into your routine.

&#x200B;

I would recommend growing your hair out longer to be honest.  I understand people telling you to change it, right now you're in between child and adult haircut-wise, but it totally works on you so I would either keep it, or grow it out for a more mature look.  See Christopher Mason ([https://www.instagram.com/christophermason/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/christophermason/?hl=en)).

&#x200B;

Another recommendation is to get a tan, most blonde guys look better with a tan because otherwise they look pretty soft, cute, or feminine.  If people are telling you you're cute, it means the feminine and youthful beauty traits are coming through more clearly than the masculine ones.

&#x200B;

You could always ignore all of these and just change your personality toward being a bit more mature (not saying you're immature), and that would also do the trick.  You're already super attractive so its up to you man.  Best of luck.

The invisible boundaries around your stippling hold in the pattern more than the hard-drawn boundaries, it makes it unsettling and difficult to enjoy for me.  If you are going to draw with stippling and leave pieces un-edged, then I recommend holding the same detail as if the edge were there, or make it completely loose as you did on the outer boundaries, but going half and half looks messy.

&#x200B;

I like the look inside of the shapes, they are satisfying and fun to look at, but as soon as the insides ""spill out"" onto the page, I lose interest.  The blue seems unneeded until you add in another feature that can pull the color forward.

I don't speak the language of the country I am in, but she does

our house is in both of our names but I can't communicate with the landlords without her

As soon as I start to leave, she will kill herself (no joke, she almost did it with a knife the first time I tried to go, blood everywhere, hospital stay)

I pay for the rent through direct transactions to my account, if I leave, I still have to pay rent unless I cancel through the landlord who doesn't speak my languages.

She has no family, I have no family, we both have no friends to support us (for different reasons)

If I get in trouble with the law, I lose my job instantly.  It is highly competitive and I will also lose my visa.

I am in debt and can't afford to move yet, hopefully that will change soon.

Altogether, i'm in a shit situation.  So i'll sit here and be a good little boy for now, until I disappear.  Trying to get a job in a different country and have them pay my transfer costs.  That may be my exit ticket."

I tried daily for 3 months to get a room at this place because it fully books the minute it becomes available, 6 months in advance.

Reason you are not rated higher is because your posture, posing, and angles are a bit off and unflattering.  Your style isn't fully developed yet, and your makeup is washing the color out of your face.

&#x200B;

Recommendations; 

Focus on fixing your posture, the gym would help here.

(If possible) grab some new clothes.  Uniqlo and HM for basics, look around for some statement pieces to build an outfit off of.  Get a few outfits that fit right, and start cycling them in your wardrobe.  FashionNova has a few good items too, it's not all thottery.

Try new looks with makeup, use highlight and blush a bit more often.  It's easy to put on, you don't have to think of it, and you won't look like your color is washed out.  Look at how doja cat does her makeup and pull things from there to try out on yourself.

&#x200B;

I know you dress this way because of the community you're in, and this is what's normal where you are.  You don't have to be extra and pull looks from some ""california gurl influencer"".  The reason you're not a 7-8 is because you look like you woke up, threw on a few clothes that you had out already, brushed your hair out, and left the house.  Try and escape the frumpy look and you will be more confident, don't tell anyone what you're doing, just start on your own and you will feel less insecure.

&#x200B;

You look like you only hang out with white people, and flex your half status to seem more diverse when nobody cares.

&#x200B;

Your hair looks like it was windy, but your outfit looks like you haven't been outside.

Lastly, this one isn't a roast, but please change up your makeup game.  You might think its good, but really it's just good enough for now.  You can do better than this.  Get some blush, a good highlight, one palette of shadow from ABH or something, play with colors, find out what works because this aint it."

&#x200B;

I'll take the hate on this one.  The friends are definitely TA here, thinking they can get a free ride off of your GF.  They can get out and watch scooby on youtube or something for free.

&#x200B;

The reason this is ESH is because, your girl shouldn't be asking you to do something that you clearly said you wouldn't do because you have no commitment to her friends.  And (((in my opinion))) you do have a commitment to your girlfriend.  If she shares an interest with you and has motivation to go to the gym, there are hundreds of ways to get her where she wants without charging her per hour.

&#x200B;

Again, ((((in my opinion)))) you should foster the growth of the things she wants to be involved in, and she should do the same to you.  You should absolutely not babysit her, but you should give her the materials to make her own plan and get her in there making baby steps to her goals.  You know, support her and whatnot.

&#x200B;

By charging her, you pretty much shut down her whole plan of using the gym because she classified your ""services"" as the easiest, most efficient way of getting the result she wanted.  Now instead of giving her alternate routes to get there, she's been shut off and can move her motivations elsewhere.  Doesn't sound that bad?  Well also, you just gave her and all of her friends a common conversation piece any time the gym is brought up, so they are all probably going to be shitting on you behind your back.

&#x200B;

I recommend that you take her and her friends out to lunch or something, tell them you thought about everything in depth, and although you want to help and be involved, you can't put it in your schedule unless you're getting paid for it, but hey, I can be a resource if you need it, you can vet stuff through me and I will help you out where I can, here are some resources to make a workout and nutritional plan custom to your taste without having to pay someone like me.  Whenever you're ready for a personal trainer, you guys know i'm here for you, and if you hire me, i'll make sure you see the improvement you want.
