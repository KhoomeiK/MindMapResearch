We were doing Samsung repairs for years before we became Apple certified, and it’s ALWAYS been busy. There’s never a shortage of people with busted phones and boomers who fall for scam bait in my area. I lost all faith in humanity when a client returned the day after he picked up his computer because he fell for the same scam. Some people should not be allowed to operate technology."
politics,fdlhays,t1_fdl2wrz,1578524010.0,"My mortgage company did some funny business with a refund they sent me for overpaying in 2016. The IRS caught the error and sent me a notice early 2018 that I owed. I explained that this was not a loan (income), but money I had already paid taxes on when it was earned, and this was a refund for overpayment of escrow. I had all the supporting paperwork, but because Chase put incorrect info on the form (they listed it as income and doubled the amount we actually got) they filed with the IRS, they weren’t going to let me off the hook. The IRS was “nice” enough to half the amount they were asking for because of the error, but refused to budge on the rest. I’m sure I could have gotten a lawyer to force Chase to submit a corrected form, but it would have cost me more in the end than what the IRS wanted. Obviously it was better to pay and get the IRS off my ass. 

It’s cheaper for middle/lower middle class to just pay than it is to pay a lawyer to fight it. That’s why they go after us more than rich people."

I did a halfway decent job, but there are parts, mostly around the edges, that just look like ass. Next time I’m definitely taking the parts out of the car and using a heat gun instead of a hairdryer (lent heat gun to a buddy and haven’t gotten it back)."
mazda3,fdjrqix,t1_fdj6d6t,1578485040.0,This is the correct answer. My last car didn’t have a hole. When something broke in the shift lock you had to completely remove the trim around the shifter and know exactly where to stick the screwdriver. It was a complete pain in the ass.
AskReddit,fdihlra,t3_eld4mi,1578443099.0,"Freshman year of high school I got 3 days after school detention to clean the lab because some dumbass at my lab table, not even my lab partner, set a paper towel on fire by pouring an oxidizer on it. When the teacher came running over to put out the fire, this dumbass points at me and had the balls to say I told him to do it. I guess, in his tiny brain, he figured that if someone told him to do it, he wouldn’t be in trouble. I just happened to be the closest person. He wasn’t a bad kid. just dumb as a bag of rocks. His lab partner wasn’t all there either - he once set his hair on fire when he bent down to pick up his pencil and his hair went into the Bunsen burner flame."

Me: plans range in price depending on how much data you need

Customer: Plan? I told you I didn’t want to pay. I’m trying to save money not spend more. 

Me: I’m afraid I can’t help you then. There’s just nothing that exists that will let you connect to the Internet from a mobile device for free.

GeekSquad,fd6toyi,t1_fd635bm,1578195578.0,"False. It’s three times, for the same repair, for the life of the plan. If you purchase the GSP for three years, you have three years. If you didn’t get any GSP then it would have to be three repairs, for the same problem, within the manufacturer’s warranty period. 

If they’re sending it back and saying they can’t find anything wrong, that doesn’t count as a repair. Your best course of action is to politely plead your case to management and hope that they will work with you. If you can demonstrate it overheating while in a game at the store, it will greatly help your case.

**edit**

It’s been brought to my attention that it doesn’t apply to items repaired under the manufacturer’s warranty. I’m only leaving it in because I’ve seen the service center work with the manufacturers to replace repeat offenders from time to time. Just be aware that this would not be the normal course of action, and your experience may vary."
