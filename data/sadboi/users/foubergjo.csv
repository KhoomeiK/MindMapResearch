explainlikeimfive,f1sa0o9,t3_damdqg,1569726145.0,"Ditto to everyone about the random spellings and eventual ""uniformity"" inspired by dictionaries and an increased number of literate speakers.

I'm a L2 (second language learner) of Spanish and a native English speaker. 

Spanish only has 22-24 phonemes while English has 38-45. (World languages like these two have A LOT of speakers spanning a big portion of the globe).

*Phonemes are distinct sounds of speech. We think of these as letters, but English doesn't have the same amount of letters to match the phonemes.

English also has a lot more phonemes than Spanish so exponentially there are more combinations in English than in Spanish.

Examples- English sound /zh/ or / í/; this sound has no singular letter to represent it. Example words are azure, measure, Jacques (loan words/names from French), casual. 

So / í/ can be represented as z, s, j, or s. This variation is confusing so many people believe that /zh/ could be an allophone of /s/ /sh/ /z/ or /j/. S sound, Sh sound, Z sound, or J sound (/d í/ for j sound) respectively.

An allophone is a variation of a phoneme because phonemes change based on mouth position and the way your produce the sound (though teeth, throat, nose, etc.,,) 

Allophone example- Stop versus top. Say stop and put your hand in front of your mouth to feel if air hits your hand when you say the t (it shouldn't), but when you say top it should. These are two different sounds of /t/, but we only use one letter for these sounds. The two variations are the same phoneme or base sound. 

This happens a lot in any language. Allophones are everywhere, but we don't notice them because our brains steam line when we're in diapers.

I could go on. Comment if you want more explanation."
