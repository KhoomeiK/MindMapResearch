PraiseTheCameraMan,f27ws3g,t1_f27tvxj,1570047726.0,"And when the well organized militia's leaders take an action that results in armed conflict? When they depose local or broad authority because they disagree with the laws, politics, regulations,  or taxes they impose? Maybe you agree with that group, maybe you don't. Who knows if you'll be ostracized or accepted.  

I think many people advocate for this assume that a well organized militia would enable them to protect them selves from an overreaching government, should the need arise.  

But,  when you consider that the militia might not have your interest in mind,  it becomes hard to distinguish from a gang. The attitude that we need to protect ourselves from our government,  gives rise to mafias, terrorist organizations, hate groups,  and paramilitary forces.  The differences between each is largely a matter of perspective.  

Buying guns and picking sides is not self defense,  it's delayed suicide."

When life is threatened,  the response matches the threat."
PraiseTheCameraMan,f27uoi7,t1_f27tb9n,1570046463.0,"The outcome of conflict, including war,  is not synonymous with the loss of life.  This conflict,  like many police administered conflicts, has primarily yielded violence when one party was threatened, and the violence escalated equitably to the threat. When the tools that allow either party to instantly end the life of the other are removed,  people don't feel the need to shoot in self defense. 

Tensions still flare.  Arguments,  protests, arrests,  and riots all occur with only rare occasions where deadly force is used by either party.

We don't need more guns to fight people with guns,  we need to find a means to resolve conflict with out them.  Guns accelerate death,  not the resolution of conflict.


Edit: That's my first silver! Thank you stranger."
