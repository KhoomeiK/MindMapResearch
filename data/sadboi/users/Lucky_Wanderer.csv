Turkey,ff66kwb,t1_fb4wy5g,1579620358.0,"You cannot help yourself from referring to other nations, can you? You know- you can keep your pseudo anti-imperialist meta-narrative to yourself. The Armenian genocide happened, and you are denying it. ""forced relocation"". Get out of here. And no, they would not have killed millions of Muslims.
Your nonsense reminds me how Americans say Japan was going to sacrifice the whole population if the U.S did not drop atom bombs; in fact, they had already agreed to surrender, and either way the atom bombs were not justified.
I do not know how you can make up events that never transpired to deny one that actually did."
Turkey,fb4ae4q,t1_fb4a212,1576505034.0,"I know Sirnak is a province of Turkey, and I still will claim the Turkish army is an invading army, especially when you consider the forced removal of elected officials in Kurdish regions."
Turkey,fb49l44,t3_eb4wxq,1576504563.0,"Listen, these posts about ethnic cleansing are tiring when it comes from a group people reluctant to accept the Armenian genocide. Nobody is denying that ethnic cleansing of Muslims happened, but accept yours first. Also, from your post, we can see that the revolutionary groups targeted the state, not civilians as such"
Turkey,fb49e2j,t1_fabpne2,1576504444.0,"Or they are part of an invading arming who should not be there; and thus she died serving the avarice of a few rich people? How about that? Also, calling people ugly gets you nowhere. Kurds are not ugly; stop projecting insecurities about your own nation on others. Thanks"

Turkey,f4ggz8r,t3_dkfeu1,1571581024.0,"Stop making up lies about the YPG. They do not ethnically cleanse or kidnap Kurdish children.  
Stop being five years old by nitpicking what some idiot said to justify your nation's invasion of Kurdistan and your fasci psychosexual attachment to your nation's state. Just fucking stop"

He likes to justify mass-murder by referring to the crimes of people irrelevant to the issue as it is currently, not to mention his own state has committed worse crimes tenfold; we can even go as far to claim she may even been killed by her own state."
Rethinking_the_left,etc80e5,t1_etc1p1v,1562678066.0,"I thing your point was concise and clear.

I agree with you, and believe the left has surrendered to superhero-movie like moral dualities. The majority of the left perceives themselves to be good against the evil as represented by the right. Leftists tend to adopt ""soft"" and ""moral"" positions which can be found in the repertoire of any liberal. I think it is a dangerous position which inverts the left into a non-marxist and infantile semblance full of only repeated buzzwords.
Also, another problematic emanation of this point is the urge to constantly silence any discussion when an assumed oppressed group holds a discussion with a person who they see as less oppressed than the rest; it is almost as if many leftists take the position of the moral arbiter of the world and thus, the protector the oppressed needs. It is a horrid again, inversion of the a ""white man's burden"". This usually occurs when the their positions are being challenged and so, they choose to justify their half-thought position by coaxing the ""oppressed"" group into their position. And indeed, when racism takes such a form it can be even more problematic than the explicit racism of the right."

Turkey,et5z751,t3_ca4go7,1562498045.0,"I am tired of these kinds of videos tbh. 
It reminds me of how rich people are vaunted for building a hut in a village they or their friends just helped destroy.
You are a soldier- don't pretend you are anything but a destruction machine."
