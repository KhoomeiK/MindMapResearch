depression,fnios6b,t3_g1jxci,1586983705.0,"There are no good things happening for me. Best time of my life never came, and by the looks of it, never will. I was only somewhat good in pre uni schools (I am not from US) and that was all I had going for. Now I am at uni and, well, even my learning abilities hit the wall. I have failed first year, and probably will fail again which means I am out. After that I don't know what I am going to do.
My family is in the middle class and I have absolutely no reason to be this depressed since I have most prerequisites someone needs for normal life."
depression,fle4nx6,t3_fo0vpd,1585077524.0,"I am 21M and never had gf too because of my severe depression. I simply didn't want to be a burden to noone. I am very shy and I am not good looking (average at the best). Some girls were clearly into me but I'm so fucked up and stupid. I used to be good only at one thing, school. Now I am turning into dumbass because my depression got even more severe and can't learn even simplest things at college. I will 100 % drop out in near future. That will be it."
