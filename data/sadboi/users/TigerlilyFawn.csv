depression,fqm4n4k,t3_gjjnzd,1589471431.0,I feel the same way!! It’s like I don’t feel this pressure of having to go outside and be productive all day. I don’t have this pressure that I’m suppose to have a career (I’m graduating college in a month) I constantly feel like a failure because I compare myself to everyone and it feels so nice that everyone is in the same position and just stuck
depression,fp2jzq8,t1_fp2gxa5,1588263067.0,I agree with this! I’m just a sad woman then I come across these posts and I just get so angry at myself. I feel like I’m suppose to be finding the good in my life but honestly there isn’t. I don’t have good external sources to turn to and I don’t have good internal sources because my mind just tells me to get numb as soon as possible so I don’t bother anyone else with my bullshit. I have the urge to end it all the time but I know if I do other people will get angry at me

Advice,eue3bbu,t3_cfti85,1563734239.0,"My parents were/are the exact same while growing up I’m 21/f now and I know how this can affect your mind and growth. My advice to you since you’re not allowed to do extracurriculars is try to confide in a teacher than you want to see a therapist and maybe try talking to your school counselor. My biggest regret was not rebelling and leaving the house to be with my friends without my parents permission but I understand how terrifying that is to do. Keep your grades up so you can go to college far away. Watch YouTube to try to learn things you’re interested in, I don’t know how your parents are with the computer but don’t go on social media all the time bc it’ll make you feel like people are always together which isn’t the case. Your parents strictness is NOT your fault, if your friends are going to judge you on that they’re not your friends. You can’t control how your parents behave and feel towards you, it is nothing to be ashamed of but I totally relate. Feel free to PM me if you need any help."

UCSC,erq7bk1,t3_c2a0qk,1561136838.0,"I’m from Merrill and have lived there for 3 years. My first year I was in the dorms and the stereotype of it being quiet and chill is semitrue. My first year 2016-2017 was crazy in the merrill dorms. There were people smoking in their rooms, people on psychedelics, the quad above me had people snorting c*ke. There is a smoke spot behind building A with chairs if you walk farther into the forest. It is secluded and up on a hill so you feel isolated at times and the hill makes it harder to leave as you don’t want to walk up that hill again. I think the reason people did so many drugs my first year is bc it’s secluded on a hill. I didn’t really like the atmosphere of closed doors and not being able to socialize with people. Many people stayed in their dorms playing games all day and if that’s something you’re into merrill is perfect for you. My regret is staying at merrill too much and not joining clubs and organizations my first year. Your friends aren’t only from merrill but you will walk with them as graduations are based on what college you’re in. Personally, I didn’t like Merrill’s location bc it makes it harder to walk to the gym as the only time I had was early morning or night and those are prime COLD hours. People at parties will think you’re lame too if you say you’re affiliated with merrill.  A pro is that there are a lot of study spots: baboa lounge, MAS, casa Latina, crown library, fireside lounge, etc. Again, this was all my experience and it seems like everyone else loved merrill."
