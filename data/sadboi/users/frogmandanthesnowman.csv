But the government will withhold highway funds if a state makes it any other age. So basically they forced the states to make the age 21. But this time the federal government is saying fuck that we aren't even going to consider state sovereignty at all. Besides the age states can still do what they want with how alcohol is sold, where it its sold, and things like that. The federal government isn't even using the work around. The government is only supposed to regulate commerce that occur between state lines, between Native American Reservations, and abroad. How cigarettes are sold should be up to the states like it has always been."

Some people don’t think it bothers you tell them... so tell them it is and that you aren’t supposed to vape here. They probably will feel embarrassed and wait and do it somewhere else.
It’s a complicated issue to some and some people may even be ignorant of the law. Vaping is sometimes tolerated in some states inside. In some states smoking is. Las Vegas has a lot of indoor smoking but the fines for smoking where it is not allowed are as intolerant of it as anywhere else.
