Pretty sure the kid has a more regular name,the whole X AE thingy is just an allies so she can refer to it online without constantly having to use the word ''my child '' (also i read somewhere that its legally impossible for a name to consist out of numbers and other symbols so)

i am sorry your mom believes all that kind of stuff, do you have any other relatives you can contact? Maybe people who have more ''authority '' in your mom eyes like grandparents?

Sorry, but that's just a fact
 And when it comes to bullying money doesn't matter, since i am pretty sure they will sent their kid to a fancy private school filled with childreb of other rich people.
I still hope that the whole X AE X-12 thing is a troll to make the press go off while irl the kid has a more or less normal name (atleast one that does not consist out of symbols and numbers, yet again we are talking about grimes and Elon musk here, so its gonna be kinda unusual anyway)"

popheads,fprb8hb,t3_g479qq,1588848963.0,"I feel like '' Pure Heroine'' by Lorde (her debut album) does not focus on love that much. Its mostly about growing up, being a teenager and talks about fame and social status. 

Mgmt' s album ''little dark age '', though pretty dark (its synth pop with darker touches) is also not about romantic love and sexuality. It was written as a reaction to Donald trump being elected.

 Mo's Album ''No Mythologies to follow '' is also not focused on love with the exclusion of one track (slow love). Overall though, this album is about being young and unsure about your place in the world.

Another one i would recommend is'' 7'' by the band Beach House. The themes of this album are  *""the beauty that arises in dealing with darkness; the empathy and love that grows from collective trauma; the place one reaches when they accept rather than deny.""* I just decided to quote the band here, i couldnt really describe what the album is about myself. Nonetheless, its a great dream/psychodelic piece of art i absolutely love and adore.

 I genuinely hope that they are both trolling rn, just to watch the press go off (similairly to what grimes did when stating that she got an eye surgery to combat seasonal depression) 
Also this name kinda goes against the law bc a name cant contain characters or numbers.

But if they really named their child like that, then i am sorry.... but its not ok. The kid will get 100 procent bullied and no money will protect him from ending up as an outcast because of that.

 Same thing about privilege: judging people for the social class they were born into is kinda weird. As long as they don't market themselves as someone with an unprivileged background while literally living off their parents money. In that case that would be false advertising to seem more relatable.

So i am not saying that we should go around policing people and telling them what to do.I cant play the internet police and i am also not trying to. I also did not say that you are not allowed to take pictures of yourself when you are skinny due to an eating disorder. 

I am not bodyshaming, i honestly would never and i am not trying to slap anybody on their wrists.

SapphoAndHerFriend,fommk7b,t1_fomm9ti,1587895750.0,"Oof i remember when i saw the first film all the way back in 2015 i kinda shipped reylo bc in my head, they made a lot of sense together and the last jedi just cemented my assumption that they really will end up as a couple. Welp guess i was wrong oof. As i have already said, i have not seen the rise of the skywalker but boy oh boy, everything i have heard about this film was so incredibly negative i ended up surpressing my wish to see this film in cinemas and ultimately forgetting it even came out in the first place. Now that u have explained all the details of the relationship mess that is going on in this film i want to see it even less than before, lmao
Which is honestly kinda sad bc i enjoyed the last jedi and i really liked the cast"

He gave plenty of female n male artists good and bad scores, it has to do with his opinion on the music and not the gender of the said artist."

I have seen this trend spread to other places, almost all my female friends (most of whom do not have tik tok) are obsessing over really skinny guys ''who are one cigarette away from dying''. I get that people have a certain type that they find more attractive but the emphasis on men having to be almost malnourished looking just rubs me the wrong way."
