Anxiety,eyx813a,t1_eywjurx,1567546898.0,I have the same question.... like how do I know what thoughts to dismiss and which ones are legit concerns?
Anxiety,ey9au6p,t3_cwa9tj,1566939106.0,"I’ve never done self harm so can’t relate to that but I can relate to feeling like you can’t do anything right. I’m going through a bad time right now too so I’m there with you. My advice is to stick to the facts. If you are a good person and other people don’t see that. Those are their insecurities and not yours. Easier said than done, I know. But it may help the brain from spinning."

Message me if you want to chat."
