1. 1br and Studios are being snatched up the fastest, with short post longevity. Faster this week than 2 weeks ago, now that things are opening back up. In downtown, 1br is still usually $2000+. 

2. 2-bedrooms are seeing a slight drop but only in the most expensive areas like Coal Harbour. Burnaby seems to be doing better. There are a few big buildings in the higher-end that have offered some incentives (50% off your first month type) but they're all short term offers.

3. More expensive places ($3500+) or 3 bedroom+ have seen a bigger drop (10%+). 

4. There are more furnished rentals than ever before, which are suggestible AirBnBs

5. We've been looking at AirBnB bookings for the summer on the island, but they're getting booked up faster. It seems like most people aren't able to travel over seas for vacation this year so local Airbnbs are getting booked up. A friend of mine says she's gotten more calls from Albertans as well. 

I'll keep looking but now that things are opening back up I think the the areas that will drop will be in the high end, but low end will see an increase in renters as more people hold off on buying property or are looking to downgrade their living situation."

**Most extreme scenario**: China is found to have been the source. Not only that, China knew as far back as November and then maliciously hid it and under-reported the damage. 

What then? War? China simply points to reports that the US knew about it in November and even by March was downplaying what was going on in Italy. They’ve got the confirmation from US intelligence agencies that the lab did not create the virus. They've already shut down exotic markets (NOT wet markets, which were never the problem to begin with). So to throw off blame, the US threatens a trade war... once again... and then what? 

**Second scenario** China is found out to have been the source, but they didn't do anything malicious. They reported numbers as close-to-honestly as they had it and took as much actions as they reasonably thought made sense. Like most other countries, they under reacted in the beginning and overreacted to correct. 

What happens then? After all, they were far from the only country to not take it seriously. The world grumbles a bit about how China could have been more pro-active and then... nothing happens? Do people demand their own governments to step down instead? 

**Least likely scenario** After extensive investigation by a neutral party, with full support from the government, China is absolved of all blame. 

Would you believe it? Or would the world say that the WHO is in China's pocket, again? Or say they changed records and killed witnesses? Would countries then take personal responsibility? Or demand another investigation? 

I just don't get what would come from this. It feels like a political grandstanding to shift blame rather than any real hope for change. Xi isn't going to step down, China isn't going to change their ways, so what’s the point?

**Edit**: Instead of empty gestures and finger pointing, this is what I would rather happen (and full disclosure, I'm Taiwanese so I may be biased): 

The countries should gather and restructure the WHO from the ground up, giving them ACTUAL POWER to stand up against EVERY country so they could have done their job in investigating this earlier. And (again, biased) I would love for these countries to actually stand up to China and let Taiwan into the WHO so they can learn the same system of early notification.

When confronted against the evidence, he waves it off as ""it was taken out of context"". Early on I just thought he was a hypocrite who doesn't have any integrity, but now I think he genuinely can also change his memory to fit his current situation.

So I don't think they'll say they were wrong, they'll simply say they always knew there was a risk and then shift their blame onto someone--anyone else. They'll blame the governor, the health care system, or China."
funny,fqmptov,t1_fqmoz44,1589481494.0,"Well let's say this: if you asked an average redditor, college educated, and give them the choice to spend a day with a professor who has multiple PhD's in computer engineering or astrophysics (topics the average redditor might enjoy), or to spend a day with a multi-millionaire who owns a couple successful companies and owns a yacht, a private jet, and a fleet of sports cars-- who do you think the average person would rather spend time with?

And again, these aren't Trump-worshipping, undereducated Joes, but my guess is more the latter. Which I don't blame them, because I would too. I can't relate to an astrophysicist so it's hard to look up to them."

To be considered ""upper class"" (or top 1%) you'd typically need more than $450k/year to qualify, which would still be far from enough to afford a private jet.

Finding out your partner was a victim often puts people into various defensive modes because they're untrained to handle it, and could cause him to feel he needs to caretake/walk on eggshells around her. 

More importantly, does she absolutely NEED her husband or NEED a man to help her heal? It's one thing to seek out a therapist or counsellor until she feels more ready to share and another to ask your loved ones to play that role while you're in the midst of healing.
