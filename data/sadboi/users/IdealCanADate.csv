I in no way equate IQ to mental ability or disability, I just understand the military may want some metric they could measure to be able to say no to someone without fear if a lawsuit.

What are humans dominate of if it is true? Sex? If so, we have many independently developed cultures that do not engage in sexual acts. Is the assumption here that evolutionary means to pass on genetics?
The big hurdle you have here is tracking the evolution of humans and their social interactions. What big historical events or evolutionary changes have happened to our species that this could be a valid question?
(2) Why would dolphin behavior be similar to human?
(3) If you want to claim it’s evolved you’ll have to find out if the trait is hereditary. So what genes control this behavior? As well as, would this be a primary evolved trait, or could it be a secondary? A spandrel. Like an effect of a different evolutionary behavior.
(4) on what means does the evolution occur? Do you believe that all evolutionary changes are a constant drive to always be the best at any given moment, and even a .0001% better chance at survival is immediately selected upon? Or do you believe there is punctuated equilibrium? 
(5) Mating behaviors are assumed for animals. Why? Because we can’t talk to them and ask. For humans your question could be asked and get a social answer. Psychology is a good starting point. For animals we have animal behavior as a separate science from humans because we can only best approximate animal answers. Why? Well, for humans many cultures have unique emotions that other cultures do not. The same could be true for animals needs and desires.
(6) your hypothesis has many presuppositions: That this is an evolutionary behavior; how do you know it is?That there is a societal purpose for it. Is it possible to have behaviors that have no meaning in society? That sexuality is a desire. Can there be sex without desire?(7)And you’d have to control your experiment to be repeatable and falsifiable if you want an actual answer.
(8) big presupposition that is worrisome: Homosexuality isn’t natural and/or correct. That it is an interaction that isn’t based in a “evolutionary” means to pass on genes.

The crux of the issue I found is, you don’t know who you are helping. You don’t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for.
As well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don’t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don’t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived.
As was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.

My own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.

I’m not saying don’t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!

But as I said, you don’t know who you are helping and they don’t know you.
And if you aren’t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties.

Because fact checking sources have him at more half-truths and almost lies than truths for almost all of the candidates.

enoughpetersonspam,feiqhdz,t3_epbkwu,1579144665.0,"Short answer: no; Longer answer: in his interpretation of Jung, he feels he does.

His evidence comes from a different interpretation of Jungian archetypes.
Where Jung felt that one had to be enlightened enough to tap into the social unconscious to find truth and got away with “well if you didn’t find the same truth, you were not able to tap into the social unconscious.”
Peterson uses the ideas of archetypes as unconscious behavior associated with stories. Truth lies within the behavior from these stories, and it’s an unconscious truth that is intrinsic to the story itself.
The idea that, say Earth, is feminine he believes is one example of this. We say Mother Earth, and in every example he gives, we see that that is associated with the earth. Feminine is earth. So is chaos. To Peterson the folklore and off the wall and hidden Soviet passages are examples of where the truth shouldn’t be the same but still are. He contrasts that with what he believes is pop stories or popular culture: the Bible. His evidence of showing the same idea of a motherly earth being a womb for Jesus.
To him, these archetypes are truth (he calls Logos, and OMG don’t even get him started in Pathos and Eros) to him.
And they are the examples he feels are needed to prove he is correct. He also uses double meanings a ton.
Logos meaning truth, words, and logic, he also holds fast to the idea that those are interconnected. His truth is hidden in stories which can be “logically” pulled out.
These stories get passed down from generation to generation and become CULTURALLY ingrained into our unconsciousness. Not a genetic style like Jung. And this means Peterson set himself for only having to give anecdotal stories as proof. 

To Peterson, this is the smoking gun of evidence needed.
And it could be. IF HE HAD ANY SCIENCTIFIC EVIDENCE TO BACK HIM.

Had he done studies to explore literature. Had he done studies to show that simple phrasing drastically changed a perception for a child growing up. Had he done studies cross culturally to show how the “logos” and archetypes actually extended across cultures regardless of anything else. 
He would start having evidence.

But he doesn’t. He uses studies that did not have his context to try to prove his point. Often completely mis-citing/misinterpreting what the study found.
Lobsters I have studied, and I can tell you the social lives of lobsters are not monogomous; that lobsters mate with many males as females produce more eggs than a single male can lay; that serotonin is an aggressive response but the “defeated brain” doesn’t exist, instead what happens is the ouster recognizes the aggression is getting it killed and the pathway closes for protection. The “top lobster” does not have access to all mates; what being top lobster gives the lobster is access to a safe environment, WHICH THEN A FEMALE LOBSTER SEEKS SHELTER IN, GETS SOME OF HER EGGS FERTILIZED, THEN LEAVES, AND FINDS ANOTHER MATE. (Capitalized because I know Peterson does not condone this sexual lifestyle of a female choosing multiple mates within one night.)

My point being that Peterson has no evidence because the studies he cites never had that context and the data he presents is not his own findings, nor does it have the context to show it. Plus, much of it is anecdotal that if you were to find ONE CULTURE that, for every example of his “truths” (chaos, feminine, logos, ext.) did not correlate with a defined behavior or unconscious meaning, would then prove him wrong.

God doesn’t matter to Peterson, because he doesn’t need him to exist. Just the story to continue on for he believes there is an archetype of truth associated with the story itself.

It’s a romantic idea, that a story contains truth and changes our world. But it is not a Peterson original, and we intrinsically know, that’s not scientifically fact. Sure, the cat in a box is both dead and alive until we look, but this is NOT the chaos Peterson is talking about.

Peterson spent over 15 years writing Maps and Meanings. Any person who spent that long convincing themself they are right with no scientific evidence will never be someone who will listen to you.
And someone who never listens will never hear the truth."

Go that guy! Stop creeping and go do something else!

Oh I read more.

“Mysoginist decides to record women from afar. Instead of interacting.”

Damn it. Somehow now worse."

He binges videos and takes personality tests to re-assure himself he is a good person, and kinda pushes Peterson’s point of view as his own. He harassed people because he now thinks he knows “the real truth of the world” like Jungian archetypes will help him navigate anything. He still doesn’t have a job. And Jordan Peterson ain’t here to actually help him. 

I just wish he’d actually get a job and live a life and stop following this Jordan Peterson guy. Like go get busy enough and go get life experiences.

Isn’t that the point of Peterson? To go do something else that has meaning that’s not just binging all of his content 24/7?"
