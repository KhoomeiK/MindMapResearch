BPD,foqeoh0,t3_g8kpbm,1587991752.0,It also gives you time to think things through without the knee jerk reaction from the moment. Good job üëç
BPD,fn1p5j7,t3_fyij69,1586566884.0,"Imagine the roles are reversed and your partner did it to you instead, and then tells you it's your fault because it's your expectations. Would you be ok with that?"
BPD,fmf2f5e,t3_fus1so,1586018574.0,"Same. Also had the adult preoccupation and worry about my mom ever since I was around 3-4 same as you. My mom is my hero and I always take her side. Even though I've progressed a lot in that regard and became quite independent from her as I went into adulthood, she is still a big part of my life, I owe her everything and I don't even want to think about losing her. I hope that day is many years away."
BPD,flz0gee,t3_frye70,1585612870.0,That was amazingly well written. Very wise and self aware. You made my day.
BPD,fl3nbgx,t3_fmcou5,1584791727.0,"If you can adapt quickly you are definitely intelligent, but I think you know this. Look at your accomplishments and measure them against your past self. Try to be imparcial and admit when you see improvement. Other people's feedback is very important as we're often times bad at judging ourselves, but if you compare your achievements with your past self and are able to impartially admit improvement you'll learn to trust more and more in yourself. Tiny bit by tiny bit."
BPD,fkiaern,t3_fihbrx,1584215381.0,"I love this. Seriously congrats, I truly believe this is the only way forward."
BPD,fj1pnuq,t3_fax7h7,1582925042.0,"This is intended in the best possible way, but I know you probably won't want to hear it: breakups happen all the time, and they happen to most human beings at least once in their lives. Take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Use this time for some introspection when you're mentally ready. But you're probably not ready to calmly analyze yourself right now, so the other commenter got it right: do stuff to soothe yourself now."
BPD,fh90gp9,t3_f1v8xk,1581371136.0,Some people go into these support groups just to prey and take advantage of vulnerable people. Stay safe.
BPD,fdgk9tk,t3_ekz3kb,1578400125.0,"I love this post. I was always good at teaching others and I'd always be the one to finish assignments first and then went around seeing if anyone wanted help. Just like you said the look on their faces when they finally understood was priceless. They were so grateful and I felt useful when I helped them, I felt I mattered. I'm so happy for you."
BPD,fbgnvso,t3_ed2wli,1576854440.0,I'm proud of you. Good job :)
AvPD,f8uwkjv,t3_e272rg,1574848126.0,"Ive been in your shoes. The realization of what you could've had takes a toll on you. Hindsight is a bitch. But this pattern of complaining now against your younger self will only repeat in the future if you do nothing to change it now. You'll be much, much older looking back in hindsight at your current self and thinking you could've done much more. You can't have what your younger self let go, but you can still have something if you commit to taking real steps towards improving yourself. You can still have something. This is my rationale: the situation is fucked, right? So why not try something different this time? With open mind, just learn new things, improve yourself. What's the worst that could happen? The situation gets fucked? I'm already fucked... I'll either keep being fucked or be pleasantly surprised. Even at 50/50 those are some good odds. And they are."
BPD,f8dwx14,t1_f8dv9l8,1574512267.0,"I think none of us here know how to get a consistent self image, that's at the root of why we're here. Stoicism is definitely a good base. It's ok if the blows still make you lose it too much, just try to make it self contained. You'll thank yourself later after you've calmed down. As for appearances and acting 'normal', these things are part of the human experience. People reach out and people get rejected sometimes and reciprocated some other times. There's nothing to feel awkward about. If your core suffers too much after each blow, that just shows you're sensitive. There's also nothing wrong with how you feel. Just take some time for yourself. You go through the pain... There's no magic pill for that. It's another thing that's part of the human experience."
BPD,f8duntd,t1_f8du2gf,1574510089.0,"I know what you mean. I guess that feeling of being 'unworthy' never goes away completely, you just become better at managing it. Exposing yourself to it is the way to go, so I'd say you're on the right track. Just be careful not to 'burn' yourself out with it. Take some time before each new try for self care and introspection."
BPD,f8dsqt9,t3_e0eiap,1574508112.0,"I did this multiple times as well. From my experience it's best to move on. You're right to be proud for trying, that is a brave thing to do. Ultimately you two weren't meant to be. Give yourself time for a pity party and to take care of yourself. You'll grow from this. I gave up for a long while after the last one but eventually went back with another mindset. Hang in there."
BPD,f7wpg3c,t3_dxn8f3,1574035992.0,"I had read somewhere that C-section babies often have their immune systems affected, I had never read about what effects it could have on the nervous system. Very interesting."
BPD,f7l38ys,t3_dwpanj,1573831861.0,"They are mostly mentally ill themselves. I steer clear from places like that, being there just reinforces bad patterns, even if you like the instantaneous attention, there are better and safer places to get it."
BPD,f4ois2d,t3_dl0mok,1571702302.0,That is not ok at all. Ask your friend to sort you some help ASAP :(
BPD,f1jglnn,t3_d9g62e,1569522967.0,That's true love. Appreciate your parents while they're still around.
BPD,f19h4vn,t3_d8ag35,1569272387.0,Exercise helps a lot. Great job dude :)
BPD,ey4x58o,t3_cvkb29,1566812750.0,"This is very wise. A lesson I too learned the hard way. The sooner you realize it's not really in your best interest to stalk, the better off you are."
BPD,exli9qh,t3_ctjqgu,1566413520.0,"I can relate. My best advice is keep putting yourself out there. Life changes, things change, people change. Keep learning from experience, it will serve you. I wish you strength."
BPD,ewvr5mi,t3_cqd160,1565812217.0,"We are insignificant, individually, in the grand scheme of things. Our purpose no one really knows. Even the ones that tell you they do, they don't. I find that your individual purpose you can make it whatever you want. Personally, I try to make a conscious effort to not overthink it and stick to doing things I enjoy. Without harming others nor breaching their freedoms, of course. That's the meaning of life for me, to enjoy the ride as best you can."
BPD,ewgm5mx,t3_co5a9n,1565385006.0,That's depression. Wish you strength.
AvPD,ew6dil0,t3_cn0nsm,1565164119.0,"This is me as well, specially when interacting with people. That and thinking ""fuck it"" what's the worst that could happen anyway? Me making a fool of myself? Lol I'll join them in laughing at myself if I make a mistake. Letting go and thinking like this has helped me tremendously."
BPD,eto2tci,t1_etljw4j,1563010727.0,"Speaking as a quiet type, it is the safest route to me. I don't compromise my core and I don't risk doing or saying something that will likely cause someone to devalue and/or leave me. So keeping quiet when I'm upset about something benefits me in this manner."
BPD,etlcp95,t3_cc0q3d,1562932085.0,"I wouldn't say no matter the cost, but I forsake a lot of my own needs for my loved ones. And while making others happy I end up making myself a little bit happier as well."
ProgrammerHumor,er14fa6,t3_c021sz,1560426643.0,A bug is in the eye of the beholder
BPD,eqy8koz,t3_bzclpv,1560379167.0,Very wise.
