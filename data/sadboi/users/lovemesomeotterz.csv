I understand why the rule is in place now and how bad it could get, the issue was like you said - several people were calling me an asshole for the support to begin with. And although I heard about the original post from this sub, I did in fact view it from the engagement ring sub directly and don't use this sub so I had no idea I was commenting on something wrongly- I really thought I was simply commenting on a post that was only a few days old. And then when all these people came at me out of the blue, it really felt like I was being targeted and creepily watched just for commenting on something - since I don't have much experience with SRD. 

Put civilly, what you're saying makes much more sense than those who were coming at me in a hostile way so I really appreciate it thank you <3 a nice discussion is a lot more fruitful than people calling me a bitchy, entitled Karen who deserves to have her boyfriend leave her lol - because apparently I'm a horrid person in real life now.

I unsubbed because you told me that I was going to get yall quarantined simply for commenting on another post and you went ape shit over it. I didn't want to be involved because I don't like the sub anyway. 

Also, no need for consolation - I posted here because I unsubbed from the other sub. Plain and simple. You care so much about rules but yet, those are the rules of this sub?

JustUnsubbed,fqh61qt,t3_gix2qf,1589368930.0,"For further details, I was told about this post from someone who uses that sub regularly, so I found the post on the engagement ring page, read it and commented on it because I felt OP was wronged. Because I don't use r/SubredditDrama nor did I find the post on there directly myself, I didn't realize a post is completely off limits to everyone on the internet once its been posted about by the gods of that subreddit lol. Apparently everyone on Reddit must not comment on things that they deem uncommentable so, in order to not break any further rules, argue with any other people, and not get the sub quarantined unknowingly, which i was accused of doing, I just unsubbed because I never look at that sub anyway. 

My mentality is that you should be able to comment on or speak to whoever you want, even if a post is just a few days old. If someone was being targeted by a bunch of people and I felt those people were wrong in real life, but it happened 4 days ago, I would still stick up for the person. However, I realize this is the internet and there are dumb rules that not everyone keeps track of.

Also, I don't want to be part of something that corrals peoples usernames in shame comments for karma, even if they didn't know the rule to begin with or see the post to begin with. I realize I broke the rules, so I'm removing myself, but they are stupid rules that I don't want to, and no longer have to, be part of."

Have a great day. Also, I just unsubbed so I can comment freely without bothering anyone bc 1) I don't want to get a sub that I don't use quarantined and 2) I don't want people to tell me what I can and can't do with an anonymous internet app."
SubredditDrama,fqh47fz,t1_fqh3x6n,1589367237.0,"Yes, I can read but why would THIS subreddit be quarantined because of my PERSONAL COMMENTS on ANOTHER post? Why should I give a damn about some random subreddit? Why can't I post freely on an anonymous app and speak to whom and say what I want to. This is ridiculous lol. I was taken from an entirely different sub, tagged in this one just so you could get support from other like minded people that use this sub frequently. I, on the otherhand, do not use this sub frequently and rarely see it so again, I really think whoever I talk to and whatever I say on a platform meant for interacting is my choice. I didn't want to post in this post so I didnt. I wanted to post in the other post because I agreed with the woman so I did. Those were my choices lol. And I feel that it isn't a random internet stranger, or a sub that I don't really use for that matter, to dictate who I can and can't comment to."
SubredditDrama,fqh3pj0,t1_fqh3lwa,1589366746.0,"Or you just want to add to this list of people who ""pissed in the popcorn"" for karma lol. Let's be real, we were having a convo on a completely different post - you could've kept commenting there or even DM'ed me rather than drag me into a post I wasnt even a part of because you didn't agree with me that I didn't get why you cant show support for someone directly. It's fairly transparent.

EDIT: Also, I made it evident in the other post that I found posting on this post useless because I wanted to support the woman directly in the slew of people abusing her. It might not be in the social constructs of an anonymous social media platform but it is in the social constructs of humanity to just talk to people without worrying that they're words are 4 days old. That just doesn't make any sense to me.

EDIT EDIT: I don't frequently use this sub, look at it or comment on it so it would make sense that I don't know it's quaint rules about who you are and aren't granted the privilege to anonymously talk to on the internet."
SubredditDrama,fqh3jpq,t1_fqh3j2r,1589366590.0,Thanks for the cred. Still don't understand why a post that's only 4 days old can't be commented on. It makes no sense at all - like your not allowed to reference a 4 day old conversation lol.

AskReddit,foy0ggn,t3_ga4gjx,1588162110.0,"This is long but really interesting:

My boyfriend and I were driving to a haunted road in NJ (Clinton Rd for those of you who know) at 11 p.m. doing something in the car that kids do that's not exactly kosher but as we're driving, a pick up truck starts tail gating us and beeping so our GPS takes us an alt route that also goes to Clinton Rd but down the shadiest creepiest fucking spooky back dirt road I've ever seen. The branches on the trees even looked creepy man. Anyway, we are driving and we drive past this white jeep. We wave but the guy in it wearing sunglasses (at night) looks very grave and doesn't wave back. A few miles up the road, we see headlights pulled over on the side of the road so we drive slow and realize it's a cop hiding in the middle of the woods (?) still miles from Clinton Rd. For those familiar, you know cops visit Clinton Rd all the time to catch kids doing exactly what we were doing but not off in the woods on some weird road.

He turns his lights on and pulls us over and the conversation goes as follows, meanwhile smoke is hanging in the cab and everything wreaks:

Cop: you kids having fun tonight?

Me: yes officer I'm just bringing my boyfriend to see Clinton Rd he's from PA

Cop: you know how late it is? What are you doing on this road?

Me: *tells him about the truck tailgating and the GPS taking us here* I'm so sorry, I didn't even realize - is this a private road?

Cop: *totally ignores the question* license and registration?

Me: *hands over paperwork and repeats* is this a private road officer?

Cop: *slaps the roof of my car and walks back to his car*

While waiting for him to come back my boyfriend and I frantically hide everything and spray the car down like idiots. The cop comes back.

Cop: you're free to go. Have fun.

Me: *totally shocked and confused* oh... oh... thank you officer... is this a private road?

Cop: *laughs and walks away*

Didn't give me a reason, didn't care about the dank perfume de Snoop in the car, didn't really do anything? So we keep driving... this is a tight dirt path and we watch the cop follow us the whole time but once we spit out at the mouth of Clinton Rd he's just gone, vanished in thin air in a matter of second. No time to do a K turn and he couldn't have anyway with how tight it is and we couldn't even see his head lights in the distance. Just completely gone.

So, creeped out we go about our haunted ride on Clinton Rd and my boyfriend looks up the Google Earth view of where we are just to check it out. He pulls up a street view of the dirt road we just came out of intersecting Clinton Rd and shows me: the man we first saw with the white jeep is standing there, outside his jeep, with the trunk open, lifting something that's long, about 6 ft tall, and wrapped in plastic into his trunk. This image is super blurry and I have to see if it's still screen shotted somewhere but that night, I will never be able to explain.

We have so many theories... the cop was the ghost and jeep guys murder victim, the cop is in on the plot and just wanted us out of the woods.. so many things.. idk what we saw but we saw something."

I used to twirl my hair, tie it in knots, put it in my mouth... always when I was stressed. And when my parents would notice they'd lose their shit and tell me how dumb I looked. So now this compulsion with my hair escalated from playing/admiring how soft it was to calm me down to finding the perfect, janked up hair and ripping it out. Idk when it started or how but at some point I took a step and I feel like I've been pulling my hair out forever.

It almost feels like an eating disorder because you're right, everyone still tells me how pretty my hair is and they just tell me my short hairs are baby hairs and they're cute but I know the truth bc ik how they got that short. But when I looked in the mirror my hair looks all oily and crazy even though its probably fine. Another weird thing I'm experiencing now all of a sudden is never feeling comfortable with my part or the placement of my hair when I always was just cut and dry part down the middle and never bothered by it.

Then she said ""well but like, my hair stylist isn't like just some rando... I've known her for years. I trust her.""

And my manager goes ""well I don't think that's how viruses work.""

It was the best."

My mom got her hands on an old diary from high school and she handed it to me saying it just makes her too sad and she can't read anymore so to take it away from her. My diary, detailing my trauma, living in her home as a child was too much for her. She said it provides her closure on a time where she was worse but doesn't realize how unbelievably fucked up it left me. I feel like she doesnt even remember some of the stuff."

witchcraft,fnp5ft2,t1_fnp38cm,1587139538.0,"I would actually LOVE a reading but I am pretty broke right now and I'm not sure if you charge for your gift (ik a lot do to make ends meet and nothing wrong with that if you do). Also nothing wrong with bragging üòâ everyone admires confidence! At least I do.

I am very interested in the grounding you talked about it seems right up my alley. I literally put my face to the dirt sometimes to feel better. üòÖ and weirdly enough I ALWAYS have to shower after something bad happens. Even if its something little like an arguement with my boyfriend, I need to shower. I think its trauma related but still - I didn't even know I was doing little cleanses. I also feel REALLY connected to water. Like weirdly connected even more than just regular woodsy nature. The ocean draws me in and even just streams and rivers feel like they just pull the bad out of me and send it down stream. I sit by them and meditate and I send the bad stuff away. I never thought of it as magical though.

EDIT: also you're so right about reptiles (and amphibians)!!! They're so adorable and curious in their own weird way. Like they're not mushy and socially intelligent in the way cats are but they're so observant towards humans they like. My toad watches my boyfriend play video games and he watches me draw and write (I'm a journalist and pr rep)."
witchcraft,fnp0uli,t1_fnp0ez1,1587137241.0,"Thank you so much for this advice! I am really working on trying not to give out so much. Its odd that I do but its almost compulsive and I think because I've learned to really not care much about myself (and sometimes even hate myself) and its killin me tbh. As for cleansing, my friend said the same and said she can help me but I don't get to see her in person much, we've been snap chatting during quarantine, but could you point me in the right direction? I know there are certain things you can do with baths.

And thank you ü•∞ I love animals so much. Right now my lil babe is sittin on my lap. She refuses to let me do work video calls without being in the shot - she's my other half I feel sometimes even more than my boyfriend (who I love dearly but the first thing I told him was I'd never love him more than my cats - I'm a nut üòÖüòÖ). I just feel like animals are the only beings who do the same thing for me that I do for people. They genuinely care and connect in a way a lot of people can't..  even without true words.

I don't think my friend has much experience with tarot, as she mainly just makes things in the kitchen and in baths.. she does some really cool stuff with her laundry in the bath... but I want to look into this. I am also trying to pick up my great grandmothers craft of reading Armenian coffee grounds. I can't do it yet but I'm trying so hard."

witchcraft,fnoz3tb,t1_fnoygig,1587136327.0,"I am very interested but so lost and I'm not really confident in it. I feel spiritually connected to nature but I don't know what I believe or don't believe. I need help finding the right path or where to start. My best friend who told me she is a kitchen witch for the first time last week actually told me exactly that - that it's a generational curse of sorts. There's a lot of pain on both sides, but mainly the Armenian side. My great grandmother was sent off to South America for an arranged marriage to escape the Armenian genocide but before she left, her mother was very honest with her and told her she would kill herself in a burning tree so she could go at her own hand and no one would disrespect her body afterwards. Sadly - it's almost more comforting to know that she did this because no one could hurt her or desecrate her remains and a new chapter began with my great grandma.

EDIT: The other pertinent part is that my great grandma always told me specifically to watch out for mal occhio (evil eye), basically just ill will and ill wishes

DOUBLE EDIT: and yes, it is concerning and it hurts. I'd love to learn how to control or protect my energy. I get very sad, tired and sometimes it even hurts. I even have a digestive related issue that is a result from stress."
