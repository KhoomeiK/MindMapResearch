cosplay,fpd4fnc,t1_fpd3zwf,1588519618.0,"Hello!! Omg glad you asked lol so I messaged the guy / emailed him and didn't hear, I think after a couple weeks I dm'd him on Instagram again, and he said ""oh I'm sorry I thought I sent them the first time, my bad!"" So glad I got them, was mildly irked because the pics looks exactly like what he showed me the day of shooting, so not much editing lol he must have just thought he sent them sooner. So yeah that's that, guess it happens"
mentalhealth,forrh9s,t1_forqref,1588017226.0,"This was really insightful to hear and I appreciate your post! I was on the same boat about college, my mom encouraged me not to get a job because she thought it would affect my financial aid and I didn't have a car so I used funds from working the previous two years and shut myself in a lot of the time while in college. So I totally relate, my current job has kept me social and helped me want to stay social. I've always been a little anxious about hanging out with people and get antsy when I'm getting ready prior and notice I sweat more often in social interactions until I adapt and get comfortable and calm down. So now I feel like if I were thrust into work or my group of friends again, it would be overwhelming since I'm used to hermitting lol. So I agree that I should push myself to connect with friends on skype even if I feel nervous at first because after the fact, I think it will help and I will be glad I did! 

Thank you so much again and hope things go well for you! You can always DM me as well! :)"
MentalHealthProviders,forphzz,t3_g96c39,1588016222.0,"Hello! I am a front office coordinator for a mental health practice in the US. We have about 10 in office therapists, and insurance was a pain but we managed to transition a lot of our current clients into virtual sessions for the time being. The inquiries are definitely not as frequent/flooded as they would have been before the pandemic, so I'm thinking people are preoccupied, maybe low on money and can't afford copays, and some clients have even just told me that telehealth doesn't sound like a comfortable setting (maybe technology distrust.) 
A few of our therapists set up the office to maintain the 6ft apart rule for people comfortable coming in. This has kept a somewhat steady balance, but I know our therapists are struggling a little bit and have a decent amount of availability that unfortunately isn't being filled very quickly.

Not sure if this provides you with some comfort and insight! I know a few of our therapists also utilize BetterHelp, so that could be an option if you want to maintain social distancing for a while?

Hope this helps!"

You have a whole 5 years behind him that can be filled with plenty of success and happiness for you sooner or later!! Have you talked to him about what he did when he was 20/ where he was at? Obviously not his dream job yet, so don't rush yourself and give yourself a break! Definitely open up to him if you can and I'm sure he would comfort you and understand."

FinalFantasyVII,fnhfnim,t1_fnh09eg,1586961503.0,"I agree and feel like the whispers will work in favor of the original FF7 plot, despite any glimpses into other realities. For example, maybe Zack will come back but the cast won't realize its not the true fate, so for some time he will return until the whispers turn things back to normal? Stuff like that idk.. we will see!"
FinalFantasyVII,fnhfda6,t3_g1om1t,1586961345.0,"I'm wondering if they are going to give players more control of how the plot plays out in the next installments?  That's not a typical final fantasy thing to do, but hey who knows? In this game there were a few things you could control/ unlock that differ from player to player.

I also wonder if the alternate timelines do play a role in future installments, but it'll inevitably backfire on the characters and they won't really be able to escape the inevitable? Imagine everything going to chaos and in the end they realize they have undo any changes to their destiny that might've drastically changed the plot lol. Sounds more confusing and chaotic tho. Just a thought."

I'm not gonna force him into being a super fan??? He likes some of their songs which is great! But we bond over other interests that we have in common and meet halfway with that stuff. How could ur gf really think it's THAT deep? Man  you deserve better lol I wish u the best."
relationships,fmm061r,t3_fvyqr8,1586196345.0,"Idk if you know the dancer/ youtuber Megan Batoon but she posted a video last week of baking her own birthday cake since she's stuck in quarantine with no one around. Who wouldn't do this during quarantine? It sounds super fun to just bake anyway, and it makes up for not having a normal/ fancy outing for your birthday as you might prefer due to the pandemic. If anything your BF should tell you that you deserve to make a cake and should have fun/ send pics when you're done! Shame on him, it's such a harmless activity given the world's circumstances lol."

Dreams,fipccyw,t3_f93u8m,1582603106.0,"Hmm that's really wild that such an old long term dream came back after years, and pretty much followed the same time line as your life. Would you say you had a happy childhood and maybe have been experiencing a stressful adulthood/ college hood? It could have been your brain putting you into a calming place for optimal sleep as a child, and if you feel you miss your child hood at this time, your brain is showing you exactly that. Sounds like maybe you have a vivid imagination/ creative streak too if you're dream can be so deep/ detailed, maybe at some point when you fell asleep recently, you subconsciously wanted to go back to that lake house because you knew it made you happy?"
