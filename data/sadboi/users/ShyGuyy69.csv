ADHD,fllj4g0,t3_fh08d7,1585261338.0,"I just give myself all day to watch lecture videos and do assignments and enjoy being able to space out without it being especially detrimental for once

I even give myself break time to check into animal crossing

this probably isn't helpful or even good advice, but I've just made it as enjoyable as possible for myself

I'm also not expecting myself to suddenly by super productive, I'm still doing stuff at the last minute like always, but it's fine as long as it gets done"

aspergirls,f7yvqt8,t3_dy1g8o,1574101438.0,"I'm in pretty much the same boat as you (I'm graduating next semester :D) and one thing I've done is to give myself permission to not do certain things.

For example, I've given myself permission to not have to cook all the time. So now I just eat things for breakfast and lunch that don't require cooking, and every few days I cook something that will last for several days. I also supplement with quick frozen foods when I really don't feel like cooking. I have tried meal prep, but it just doesn't work for me, so I just started doing this.

Well, that's all I've got for now, hope it helps."
