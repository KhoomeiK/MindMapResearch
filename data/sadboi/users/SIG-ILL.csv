>Now available in my Etsy store 100% handmade. Hand carved Hobo Nickel set in an 18k gold ring. Size US 10.75  
>  
> I started this project by taking an MS-65 (according to PGCS) 1937  Buffalo Nickel and hand carving/inlaying it into a Mech Skull.   
  Next, I hand carved in wax the ring. After, I cast the wax ring model  using the lost wax method (a process that remains largely unchanged over  hundreds of years). I then proceeded to hand carve the ring. After I  carved the ring, I executed all of the  metal inlays. Following the inlays, I spent a lot of time doing the very  intricate enamel work on this ring. The last step, was to set the  diamonds in the ring, and finally set the Hobo Nickel.   
 7 hand  selected 100% natural diamonds (tested on a very expensive machine to  determine this) by my diamond advisor Alex Park u/parksfinegroupinc ,  totaling 1.82 carats of f,g SI1 diamonds including a GIA (2165815001)  rated 0.46 carat G SI1 main stone set in the nickel  
 Itself. There are an additional three small diamonds carrying no rating. 2 white and 1 green diamond.   
  The ring itself consists of approximately 24.5 grams of 18k gold. It is  inlayed with 24k gold, 18k rose gold, 18k white gold, 95% platinum, and  has extensive enamel details. A rhodium coating is used on the coin for  toning purposes. THERE ARE NO INKS OR DYES  
>  
>I have worked on this ring for approximately 200 hours.   
  Please feel free to reach out on u/etsy with any questions regarding  this ring or for a custom/commissioned Hobo Nickel ring for yourself.

The price on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/777886846/ai-master-key-hobo-nickel-ring-by-jh) is $20,000.00 / €19,290.12

It's just that I don't expect much results, because like you said it's indoctrination and I'm not charismatic enough to break through that and the people I talk to very much resist independent critical thought.

I believe that most people are too shortsighted and even stupid to learn from such situations. As soon as everything is going back to normal, even it will only last a short while, changing things so we can prevent or benefit in the long-term becomes unimportant to them.

That said, I honestly want humanity to prove me and my pessimistic beliefs wrong."

What exactly do you mean there? The way it is phrased now, it sounds very logical to me: if the quality is the same, it looks the same."
antinatalism,fkx3dzi,t1_fkwj6gw,1584617270.0,"I agree that it can be selfish and insulting to the child if it's done from the motivation of ""I as a parent want more children because of my personal enjoyment reasons"". However I'm an only child and sometimes I wonder if it would've been better for my social development if there had been a brother of sister in my life. Of course we will never know, and both situations has it's own advantages and disadvantages, but I'm just saying that some parents may come from such a ""we don't want the child to be alone"" perspective."

It's interesting, because gatherings with over 100 people are illegal at the moment.. which is pretty much what a school is. Most activities and events are cancelled though, but it's not an actual full lockdown as you're describing. I've also heard that hospitals will have to send home elderly and infants from the IC to make room very soon (or maybe they're already doing so). It's probably because of these 'half-measures' that I'm underestimating how bad things are/can get."

Maybe the fact that our government hasn't called for actual isolation yet makes me underestimate the severity. Gatherings with over 100 people are illegal at the moment, and a lot of events and activities are canceled, but as far as I know it the recommendation is just to stay at home if you don't have to go somewhere, which sounds less scary than ""go into isolation""."

It's basic, high level public-key encryption diagram, which most people on this subreddit probably already know and understand. There are too little details to dive into and talk about, at least that's how I feel about it.

And since people seem to think I sound like a dick on the internet lately, a disclaimer: I'm not saying that I'm elitist and this shouldn't be posted here. Understanding the basics of encryption is of course very useful, and more power to those that \*do\* get something out of this post."
collapse,fkh7yem,t1_fkh75ns,1584191619.0,"> If you were a US resident, surely you wouldnt take the risk of not  preparing and ending up with nothing in the worst case scenario. 

I would think this could happen everywhere? And if everyone is stocking up now because they're going to stay at home, wouldn't that mean that once they won't leave their home the stores will be better stocked again? Unless the stores will be closed, is that something people anticipate?

To be clear, my previous post was not to mock anyone, I just honestly can't imagine full isolation would be required. Sure, in my country they also have increasingly strict recommendations, and as you say ""prepare for the worst"" makes sense. It's just that  apparently I'm blind to the reasons everyone is worried this badly."

Unfortunately I'm having trouble articulating why I don't consider it profit, but I will try with an example based on the firefighter: the firefighter prevents stuff from burning down.
