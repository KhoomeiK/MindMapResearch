footballmanagergames,fl6fpne,t3_f1exao,1584866775.0,"Hey Guys  


Sorry for the essay but If you guys could help me pick a team I would love it. This Isolation thing down here in Australia is starting to catch up with you guys over in Europe so I need a good save to help me take my mind off it. I have severe anxiety and depression and this is not helping at all. My wife has also just been told she no longer has a job so I need this to be my big escape. I'm assuming like many of you in these times  


What I am after in regards to a save is a long term save that is something a bit different. Not really worried about league or country just something that will be a long term challenge that will take my mind off this horrible situation  


I hope you are all doing well. Stay safe and thanks for your help"

footballmanagergames,eznlo03,t3_d0bk48,1568007820.0,"Hey guys 

Looking for a Vanarama North/South side that has a bit of upside. Attempting to do a no transfer save and see how high I can get them without signing any players and only using what’s available to me at the start of the game and and youth players that come through. Going to focus on training and tactics to see how far I can get so any suggestions for teams would be greatly appreciated.

Reason I am doing this is due to going away with work and only having my laptop which can only run a few leagues at once so I am only loading all the English leagues

Thanks in advance for your help"

footballmanager,eykihpf,t3_cx5fdg,1567153436.0,"Mate I just did the same thing I spent about 4 days deciding hahah

I have decided to do a challenge of not sigining any players and seeing how high I can get. 

My focus is going to be on tactics and individual training. 

Reason for trying this is due to all the clubs folding recently due to financial mismanagement. By having a club not signing any players it should allow spending to remain under control

Team I decided on was Stockport county as they used to be in the championship 15 years ago so trying to restore them to their former glory

Good luck on choosing a side"

hawktalk,erpksrc,t3_c39zbq,1561120887.0,"It seems like a lot of them just don’t have the hunger anymore in my opinion. Maybe that happens after all the flags and then essentially with this season over it’s not worth it for them. There were a few times Gunston gave up on a chase or players didn’t Shepard when they need to. 

There is really no incentive to win anything else this year. Once again in my opinion it’s time to play the kids for the rest of the year. See what they have then move on anyone at the end of the year that is older and has value and start a proper rebuild

Love this club more than anything and been a member 30 years but I think this is the point they need to be honest with themselves about what the remainder of the season is about."
