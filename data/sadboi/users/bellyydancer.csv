ptsd,epou7iy,t3_bun6uj,1559353710.0,Alright. Here goes! We’re at the airport. Flight leaves in a few hours...
ptsd,epkc1lv,t1_epishun,1559271960.0,"Thank you ❤️ I hope so as well. I’m debating whether or not I’m making the right call...but I’m planning on going big and just outright facing it. The day we are in my hometown, I want to stop by the house I lived in, the school I went to (both of which are okay by me. I don’t have any issues with those). The issue might come in when we visit the market. What happened there is what caused all of my problems."
ptsd,epk3x1z,t1_epihxti,1559267052.0,"It is definitely amazing! They reach out all the time. Even to the point where they invite you to come to a service. They are happy to accommodate anyone. It doesn’t matter what you are or what your background is...if you walk in those doors...they are just happy to see you. I’m sorry to hear about your brother :( I can definitely understand why you wouldn’t want to go back, but it’s great that you’ve found a way to deal with it!

And I could give updates, if anyone is interested. Could always send it in a message or something!"
ptsd,eph0ogs,t1_epfhxxj,1559220844.0,"I’m actually glad they offered. My husband is Lutheran, and I go to his church with him once in a while. The people at his church do a LOT for people of other faiths. After the synagogue shooting in Pennsylvania, his church gave us a place in their building to hold all of our events/activities if it would make us feel safer. (We’re not in Pennsylvania, but it’s still unsettling of course). There were some people who offered to stand at the doors to my synagogue as well.

The people at his church all know me and my story. They know I wouldn’t go back to Israel alone. (I got to a point where I honestly would be okay if I NEVER went back). But they thought this would be an opportunity for closure, so they invited me and offered to cover all of my costs. The day we go to my hometown, I am also going to be seeing the people I went to school with. I haven’t seen any of them since I left, of course, but we all have been connected on Facebook. They don’t know I’m coming. Seeing them won’t give me anxiety or anything, but I do feel a little guilty. After connecting with all of them, I’ve found out that I’m one of only two of us who didn’t stay in Israel."
Teachers,epefw1y,t3_bulk9f,1559182219.0,I have one day left. We’re still making up cold/snow days 😂
ptsd,epe9uwk,t3_btx7jz,1559180204.0,"I explain this to my husband a lot. We both have PTSD. Mine stems from growing up during war. My husband’s came from surviving an EF-5 tornado. He occasionally tells me that his isn’t as “bad” as mine because his wasn’t due to war. He uses it as a justification (for lack of a better word) for himself. When we are both having a bit of a freak out...he tells himself that because he wants to focus on helping me down from my episode.

I tell him that in my opinion, it doesn’t matter WHAT caused it. PTSD is PTSD, regardless of the “why”."
