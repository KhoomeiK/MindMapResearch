PublicFreakout,fqtqd9i,t1_fqtfdud,1589644047.0,"""The USA PATRIOT Act has generated a great deal of controversy since its enactment.

Opponents of the Act have been quite vocal in asserting that it was passed opportunistically after the [September 11 attacks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks), believing that there would have been little debate. They view the Act as one that was hurried through the Senate with little change before it was passed. (Senators [Patrick Leahy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Leahy) and [Russ Feingold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_Feingold) proposed amendments to modify the final revision.)[[166]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act#cite_note-LeahyConcernsFinalAct-166)[[167]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act#cite_note-EPICNotMuchDebate-167)[[168]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act#cite_note-EFFRushJob-168)

The sheer magnitude of the Act itself was noted by [Michael Moore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore) in his controversial film [Fahrenheit 9/11](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_9/11). In one of the scenes of the movie, he records Congressman [Jim McDermott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McDermott) **alleging that no Senator had read the bill**[[169]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act#cite_note-F-911-McDermott-169) and John Conyers, Jr. as saying, **""We don't read most of the bills. Do you really know what that would entail if we read every bill that we passed?""** Congressman Conyers then answers his own rhetorical question, asserting that if they did it would ""slow down the legislative process"".[[170]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act#cite_note-F-911-Conyers-170) As a [dramatic device](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_device), Moore then hired an [ice-cream van](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice-cream_van) and drove around Washington, D.C. with a loud speaker, reading out the Act to puzzled passers-by, which included a few Senators.[[171]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act#cite_note-F-911-IceCreamVan-171)

Moore was not the only commentator to notice that not many people had read the Act. When [Dahlia Lithwick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahlia_Lithwick) and Julia Turne for [Slate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine\)) asked, ""How bad is PATRIOT, anyway?"", they decided that it was ""hard to tell"" and stated:

The [ACLU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union), in a new fact sheet challenging the [DOJ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice) Web site, wants you to believe that the act threatens our most basic civil liberties. Ashcroft and his roadies call the changes in law ""modest and incremental."" Since almost nobody has read the legislation, much of what we think we know about it comes third-hand and spun. Both advocates and opponents are guilty of fear-mongering and distortion in some instances.[[172]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act#cite_note-SlatePatriotAct-172)"""

Please clarify if I get something wrong, but as a modern science-friendly Christian, you believe that:

Humans began building shelters and hunting with spears around 400,000 years ago. Our own subspecies, Homo Sapiens, emerged approximately 195,000 years ago.

For about 170,000 years, humans were born into misery and suffering. Most people died before the age of 4, women often died in childbirth, the lucky ones died of agonizing tooth problems since our bodies didn't evolve to live long past fertile age. There were constant turf wars over resources and people. Rape was common. Murder was common. Infanticide was common. Literally hundreds of thousands of false gods invented and forgotten...

'God' stands there watching this for A HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE THOUSAND YEARS and then decided ""hey, it's time to intervene here!"". He devises a plan to put himself into a man, let himself be murdered cruelly, then put the responsibility for that crime on everyone who would ever exist, anywhere at any time, regardless of if they would have partaken in that cruelty themselves had they actually been there. ""That ought to show these humans how to be moral!"".

And where does he choose to do it? In the most illiterate and backwards part of the middle east. In fact, according to Christians he has intervened multiple times, yet all of those interventions happened in one district on a planet that was already thoroughly populated on 5 continents. He doesn't EVER decide to appear to the Chinese (who, by the time of the supposed life of jesus, were already fully literate, organized, and had documented history that could have recorded the events in writing).

None of this proves your god doesn't exist, but I think it conclusively proves that, if he did, he would be an evil, cruel, bumbling, incompetent, confused god. He also either doesn't want people to know he exists or, at the very least, wants to purposely obfuscate and make his intentions extremely unclear."

PublicFreakout,fnwg2x2,t1_fnw80az,1587317711.0,"I'm not sure if Americans really grasp the reality that almost nobody in the world is like this besides American conservatives. It's reallllllly weird. 

Here in Canada 90% of conservatives would be centre-right leaning, putting them probably slightly left of the American Democratic party overall. Generally they support universal healthcare, civil rights, gun laws, etc... Probably half are opposed to abortion and maybe 25% of them seriously doubt climate change. The real nutcases might go to church regularly and even mention something about religion in public from time to time, but that's pretty rare. For the most part people trust institutions and one another."
samharris,fnsqcr4,t1_fnsoo8t,1587226785.0,"If I understand you correctly, you're arguing for pragmatic conformity over reasoning.

In other words, you don't care so much if something is true, you care more whether it is socially acceptable.

It's like someone argues ""2+2=4"", and your response is ""well everyone will think you're a loser if you express that, so you're an idiot for saying it""."

MB2Bannerlord,fn7zg93,t1_fn7qc78,1586730749.0,That's inspiring! Don't think I tried battanian heroes in my experiments. I did nothing either just died straight away. Could you get a victory with anything but 100% battanian archers?
PublicFreakout,fn71t97,t1_fn6brnb,1586711640.0,"Not only was he definitely, conclusively, a practising, loud and proud Catholic and absolutely not an atheist, but only 1.5% of Germany was atheist at the time, which is super low. They were a god loving Christian society motivated largely by Catholic propaganda against Jews.

The Nazis marched into battle with belt buckles that said GOTT MIT UNS (God on our side).

It's sort of impressive just how wrong you are. I feel sorry that people have lied to you this badly.

Edit: I almost forgot to mention that the nazis actually signed their very first treaty with... You guessed it - the Vatican! The Nazis wanted the Catholic Church to take over all schools in Germany and the Vatican wanted to support Hitler because they had basically identical ideology. Them the Vatican celebrated Hitler's birthday every year until he died. Bro go read a book ffs.
