AskReddit,erytiro,t3_c4p6l1,1561417048.0,"Owner of the store, Polar, had weekly meetings. Even if it was your day off, you were expected to come to the late afternoon meeting. The meetings were hell.
Polar enraged the naturopath, a kind lady from Australia, who quit on the spot, and was followed instantly by the quiet college student who had finally had enough of Polar and his rants. Go team!


I found out that Polar was dying of cancer. He believed alkaline waters and homeopathy could cure cancer and built a business around ""natural foods"". It was heartbreaking and terrifying to witness his rage.
I quit a short bit later, when I decided that his significantly deteriorating mental state (plus the weapon he carried all the time, yikes!) was more than I found reasonable to tolerate at work."
teenmom,eon67x2,t3_bsgtu6,1558705295.0,Starting the day with a fresh pressed carrot apple ginger beet juice here. First made this juice years ago at a mom and pop natural foods store and it is my favorite. Tastes a little like bubble gum to me!
Anxiety,eokc4iv,t3_bs0v7q,1558651215.0,Thank you. I needed this today.
