BPD,fpnf1iv,t3_gea73t,1588760649.0,I'm getting triggered I'm not getting comments legit want to die fuck this
BPD,fpn40j8,t3_ge61ay,1588749498.0,"I relate so hard , I try to be this funny holly which I know that I am but I got other sides too. People only like me for that side as soon as they see the other insecure part of me they end up leaving every single time. Feel like I have to put on a mask every day to please other people. Don't feel like you're alone if you're more open to people on who you are they should love you for your good side and your bad side ❤️"
BPD,fpeqnjq,t3_gd0f53,1588552880.0,"Don't self harm please! I always think too myself , That I'm gonna regret it and it's not worth it. Sometimes our minds think irrationally and jump from one extreme to the other. I would talk to someone at your work or even thinking about quitting if it's effecting your mental health. You're mental health is just as important as you're physical health. You can report to the Work , Health and safety act check people I'm pretty sure that's what's it's called! Stay strong just remember feelings are only temporary ❤️"
BPD,fpepxsa,t3_gcumht,1588552445.0,I feel this exact same feeling! Sometimes I feel bad because I feel so numb I look like I have no feelings but maybe it's just my brain telling my feelings to stop because there is too many at once. The brain can protect us sometimes..
BPD,fopi4f0,t1_fop16wr,1587962091.0,"I feel like I mainly get triggered with relationships, I can't have a stable relationship with anyone or sucks"
BPD,foopb5o,t3_g856o2,1587943610.0,"YES hard , I blocked out probably a year of my life. I was heart broken over an ex and was addicted to smoking weed to forget the pain idk if it was the weed or bpd but I literally don't remember having sex with people or hanging out with people who say we have met up heaps of times before , it scary and sad I always get flashbacks."
BPD,fookx1a,t3_g8jvs5,1587941019.0,"it hurts to read ""if you have BPD you can't be fixed , you won't be loved and will never change"" that's our biggest fear :("
