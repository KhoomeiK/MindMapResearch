Fencesitter,fr3pu55,t3_gmewd2,1589863062.0,"My husband (39) and I (34) have been back and forth between childfree and fencesitting for years. I'm extremely introverted and deal with depression and anxiety, he runs a small business and works very long/irregular hours. We have enough money to be comfortable, but adding a kid would make things much tougher. These issues in particular make me not want to have a kid.

Husband's sister had a baby back in January, and I fell in love with him right away. The whole experience made me rethink my stance, and I started thinking there was a good chance I'd want a kid someday.

Then in March the world ended and we all went into lockdown. Many many times since then, I've thought to myself ""thank God we don't have kids."" I can't imagine raising a child in this fucked up world. Husband's sister is going through hell right now caring for a baby in a pandemic. Even if I did decide I wanted a kid, I would NOT choose to do it now, which means I could be pushing 40 before it's safe again.  So I guess the pandemic was the nail in the coffin for me. No kids for us."

Because cats recognize each other primarily by smell, it's almost as if their companion is an imposter to them. Google ""non-recognition aggression in cats.""

I would suggest keeping the cats separated for now, then slowly reintroducing them to each other as if they've never met before. Every day, take a cloth of some kind and rub it all over one cat, then rub that towel on the other cat. Then switch, so that the cats start smelling like each other again. Allow them to eat on opposite sides of a closed door. If that goes well, crack the door just enough for them to sniff noses. If there's any aggression shown, keep them separated and try cracking the door in another day or two. Google can also help you with more details for this process. Take it slooooow; it can take days or weeks for them to reconcile. After my male cat had a major health scare, lengthy vet stay, and had to wear the cone of shame for awhile, my female cat was very aggressive to him for at least a month.

Despite knowing that the actual event that I'm freaking out about is never as bad as I think it will be, I still catch myself worrying. I've been in therapy for anxiety for a long time now, and this is what I've learned:

1) Recognize what's happening, and accept the anxiety instead of trying to push it away. Anxiety wants to be recognized, and will only get worse if you try to push it down. I usually think to myself ""Oh hey there, anxiety, you're back. What are you trying to tell me?""

2) After doing step 1, review the facts and challenge the anxiety. I think of it as a sort of court room questioning scenario. ""What are you afraid of?"" ""How likely is it that it will actually happen?"" (Usually very unlikely) ""What is more likely to happen?"" ""What are the consequences if your fear occurs?"" ""Can you live with those consequences?"" While the worst case scenario might really suck, you'll almost always be okay in the long run, and it's important to recognize this.

3) Practice meditation every day, even when you're not anxious. It can keep you from getting carried away with worry. There are tons of apps and videos out there, I like the apps Calm and Headspace."

Fencesitter,euc8b5d,t3_cfsl9c,1563667837.0,"Your partner may be perfect for you in every other way, but this is probably the biggest thing to disagree on that would cause the most damage to any relationship. It is completely unreasonable and unwise for one person in a relationship to change their stance on whether or not to have children in order to please their significant other. It will only lead to regrets, resentment, and any child born into that situation will DEFINITELY pick up on the fact that one parent does not want to be a parent, and it will lead to some serious issues in that child's life. Do you want that on your conscience?  


He should NOT expect you to change your mind about this. It's possible that you may someday, but there's also a very good chance that you won't. Either way, the choice should be yours alone, and should not be influenced by what he wants or by what's ""normal"". If he's adamant about wanting children and you're positive that you don't, that's a huge deal-breaker."

running,etsxzj6,t3_cdb510,1563158702.0,"It's really freaking hard some days. Sometimes I have to tell myself ""I'll go walk around the block, and if I'm still not feeling it I'll go home."" But I never do. After a hellish experience taking Zoloft, I decided I would do whatever it takes to never do through that again. So basically fear of SSRIs is what keeps me going. That and the fact that running usually makes me feel amazing. If I skip more than one day I can tell my mood gets much worse.
Edit: I am not knocking SSRIs, they're immensely helpful for many people. I just personally haven't had good experiences, and my doctor/therapist gave me the go-ahead to try exercise instead."

Anxiety,etiv8uf,t3_cbuo6i,1562860563.0,"I'm so sorry friend... I had an attack like this last month and it was awful. Through therapy and experience, I've learned the following:

1) The anxiety always comes down. I know you don't believe it right now, but trust me, it will. Though it feels awful right now, it can't hurt you and it won't kill you. It will not last forever.

2) Distract yourself as much as you can. The more you focus on the anxiety, the worse it becomes. Good movies, board games, video games, even work; anything to engage your mind.

3) (Related to 2) Get outside. This is what tends to help me the most. Go for a walk/hike/run, go for a drive, play a sport with your boyfriend or a friend (even just tossing a ball back and forth, hitting tennis balls, baseballs, etc). You may feel sick, exhausted, or incapable of doing anything, but just tell yourself ""I'm going to walk for 5 minutes, and if I hate it I'll go home."" The hardest part is getting out the door. Once you get going, the fresh air will feel so relaxing.

4) Eat little bits of whatever sounds tolerable at the moment. I don't know if you're this way, but I can't stand the though of a dinner plate full of food when my anxiety is severe, but small portions look much less intimidating. Not getting enough to eat makes my anxiety worse, and the worse the anxiety, the less appetite I have. In these situations, I tend to eat mostly apples, bananas, applesauce, yogurt, almonds, plain noodles with salt and butter, saltines, eggs, potatoes, and chicken. Don't feel confined by the time of day, eat breakfast for dinner if that sounds okay. Often times cold foods are more tolerable for me than hot, I think because they're less smelly and flavorful.

&#x200B;

You're not crazy, and you're definitely not alone. I hope you feel much better soon."

Anxiety,esux1nb,t3_c93ykx,1562290266.0,"Not anymore, but I used to for a very long time. At the time, I didn't realize that my headaches were caused by anxiety as well as pain medication overuse. I was talking ibuprofen almost every single day, despite the fact that it wasn't really helping. My body became dependent on it. It took seeing a neurologist about my chronic headaches and getting help for my anxiety before I saw relief. I still get them occasionally when my anxiety is high though. Keep track of how many days per month you're taking pain meds. If it's half of all the days of the month or more, see a doctor."

running,eqipvpk,t1_eqhtrgt,1560091519.0,"> Not racing other people. A lot of the association I had with running before was with competitive sports where we are either timed against each other or teammate rivalry inevitably forces you to try to out-do everyone else. I was pretty good at it in high school but the association with pushing your body too far and the masculine posturing that comes with trying to stay ahead of the pack left a bad taste in my mouth. Now I just run with my partner and we keep our pace even, it makes it much more enjoyable because it feels so much more collaborative and when we finish we are just proud of the distance we did. 

I think this was a huge part of my issues in the past. I always lagged behind everyone else and wanted to keep up, which meant pushing my body harder than it should've been going, then feeling like I was dying. The difference this time around was simply tuning in to my body, not timing myself or tracking my distance, just running a bit and going back to walking before I start huffing and puffing too hard."
