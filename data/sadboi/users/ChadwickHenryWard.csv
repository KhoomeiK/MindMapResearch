Alcohol is, and not by a small margin, the most harmful drug in human society and please believe me that if there were something I could do to totally, instantaneously eliminate it from human society I would.  I feel guilty almost every day abetting these people's deaths.  You are right: it is morally wrong to give this stuff out, but I don't have a choice.

I don't think this justifies it, but I am desperate.  This is the only job I have ever had that offers health insurance.  I have a developmental disability and suffer from mental illness. It is not an exaggeration to say that if I did not have access to therapists and psychiatrists and inpatient hospitalization I would be dead.  I am not saying this moral calculus - other people's lives for my life - is the right choice, but it is the only one available to me.

By the end of the story, the hero still owns the slave and feels no compunction about it.  And his victory over monumental evil at the end does nothing but restore the status quo ante.  Not only is the character okay with slavery continuing, he is okay participating in it.  For that matter, he doesn't even do anything to abolish the blood hierarchy by which wizarding society organizes itself, which the author makes very clear is objectionable.

He never fixes anything.  He lives in a deeply cruel, unequal, oppressive society and he only concerns himself with eliminating one individual bad actor.  Even worse, afterwards he becomes a wizard cop and spends the rest of his life pursuing other individual bad actors.  He makes all the right noises to show his performative objection to the lower-class status of Muggle-born wizards, but in the end he still chooses to enforce the laws of that society by violence."

I think it's argued by Kropotkin in *Mutual Aid* that competition is inherently inefficient.  This is why many animals live in large groups - wolves hunt in a pack, fish swim in a school, birds fly in a flock.  Cooperation conserves resources, while fighting wastes them.  This is also why cannibalism is relatively rare even among carnivores; it's innately dangerous to fight something that's roughly the same size and strength as you.  It's safer to cooperate.

This is also true of market capitalism.  Firms innovating secretly in competition can never advance society as much as groups freely sharing all the fruits of human labor and ingenuity.  (Of course, they mostly don't innovate anything.  They mostly just collude to defraud and exploit the public.)"

I've seen it explained a thousand times that asexuality is ""lack of sexual attraction,"" but nobody can really define what that means, so I just gave up worrying about it.

antinatalism,f9r7375,t3_e6b82p,1575572199.0,"I was in the mental hospital recently and while I was there I read a little bit of a book about climate change.  The introduction talks a lot about Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.  She famously has Autism Spectrum Disorder, and the book contended that one of the social cues that she finds impossible to read and emulate is when everybody silently agrees to ignore an obvious problem (like our ongoing ecological collapse and mass extinction.)  This of course implies that it's *everybody else* who is delusional.

I was diagnosed with ASD last year, and reading about this has thrown a familiar problem into fairly sharp relief.  

When I was a teenager, during the early years of the ""war on terror,"" I watched with horror the case of Jose Padilla.  He was an American citizen who converted to Islam and was arrested at the airport in Chicago in 2002.  He was held for years without charge, without legal counsel, totally in secret and totally without any outside communication.  He was brutally tortured into insanity.  This went on for years, until he was finally charged with something that happened well after his arrest; that is, they tacitly admitted that the thing he supposedly did - meeting with the Taliban in Afghanistan - never even happened.  They didn't even bother to come up with a lie to justify the whole thing for their rubber-stamp court.  Doctors testified that years of brutal torture had mentally regressed him to infancy and that he was therefore not fit to stand trial.  But he was quickly convicted and locked away forever.

That's what all our courts and prisons and police and new surveillance state are for; they destroy people's lives to tell the rest of us that they're keeping us safe from manufactured threats.

And nobody seemed to notice or care that any of this was happening.  I will never understand why it is so out-of-bounds to get upset about things that are upsetting.  I'll never be able to accept that.  But I see now that this comes from having ASD - that ignoring stuff like this is one of those social practices that can never be adequately explained because it *doesn't make sense.*

&#x200B;

> People choose the lives they lead. I'm here because I worked hard 

I will never cease to be amazed that professional-managerial class people actually believe that they occupy the class position they do because they filled out all the right forms.  Sure, they tell you in high school that you have to do all this paperwork because it decides your whole future, but at some point in your adult life you have to realize that that's not really how it works.  *That's* delusional.

But I think this goes a little bit towards explaining why therapists tend to tell you not to worry about stuff like poverty, hunger, homelessness, or child abuse.  College graduates tend to be institutionalized - the better educated you are, the more you tend to trust prevailing institutions (starting with your university.)  (The largest university in my state got caught shielding a serial child-rapist from the law for over a decade because it would have made their football program look bad; absolutely nobody stopped rooted for them on Saturdays and alumni are all still obnoxiously proud to be associated with the school.  If that doesn't make you stop trusting the system, nothing ever could.)  

Professional-managerial class people are inside the circle - they, and people like them, run all the institutions that oversee all of the structural problems they are telling you not to worry about.  ""They system"" has only ever benefited them; they enjoy a level of safety and comfort that is basically unheard of for most people in most times and places in history, and it's difficult for them to believe that this might be unjust.

There is an element of survivors' bias to this as well.  Almost all PMC people were born to PMC households, but even those who weren't are exclusively people who came out the other end of the university system successfully.  Anybody who tried to become a therapist but couldn't because of structural problems like poverty or racism will never be in a room with a patient to tell them about it.

So even though they are shown a bunch of poverty porn in college, and a bunch of their patients are homeless LGBT youth or whatever, they recognize that the system produces good outcomes for them, but bad outcomes for other people.  With this comes the conviction that there must be some good reason that this must all be just, or at most, *that they shouldn't think about it too much.*  You probably shouldn't either."

I guess she doesn't act like she's upset, and I feel that people are upset with me far more than what would be a reasonable amount.  I guess there's really no indication that there's anything wrong.

I do hear people say pretty frequently stuff like ""my friend told me after we left the bar that that woman was flirting with me"" or ""I didn't realize my wife was interested in me at first until a third party told me what was going on"" but that's never happened to me either.  Nobody has ever flirted with me, and so far as I know that is the assessment of everybody who knows me as well.  I think it's clear outwardly that I struggle so much in social situations, so much that nobody would ever consider flirting with me, but it's true that I don't really understand who people choose to flirt with or why, so it's possible that my assessment doesn't mean anything here."
Anarchism,f8xd7hu,t1_f8ntf73,1574915168.0,"Oh, I didn't mean to discount the woman's problem in the post I mentioned.  It's just somewhat different from what I'm worried about.

Her situation was just like yours.  All the men at her work felt she was being very suggestive, and then became abusive and threatening when she turned them down.  I didn't mean to just ignore that and start talking about me.

I understand that sort of thing happens to women a lot.  I guess men just feel that it's expected for them to act angry and entitled.

I never really have that problem.  To my knowledge, no woman has ever been interested in me, and I have never been flirted with in my life.  I have never misinterpreted a woman's behavior as interest, and I think that probably stems from thinking of dating and sex as something that only exists in movies and not in real life.  (I do know it happened to my friend I mentioned at work; a new employee, around her age, said on his first day he thought she was interested in him.  She wasn't, of course - she hated him.  He was really obnoxious and ended up leaving because he had so many conflicts with coworkers.  One of the managers told me he insulted her haircut on the way out the door, which I think is so cruel.  My friend is so kind, it's not fair to treat her like that.)

I struggle so much with what other people say.  Sometimes I'm so confused that I start to stutter, or I can't talk entirely.  I have a lot of trouble with situations where you are not supposed to give an actual answer, especially ""how are you?""

Anarchism,f8cltnt,t3_dzy0pm,1574463060.0,"I saw a post recently that upset me and I was thinking about it a lot today.

This woman was upset that a man at work was bothering her.  He had asked her out on a date, and his phrasing, as she had it, was that he ""asked if she would like to see him outside of work.""  I didn't realize saying this could be interpreted as asking for a date.  I've never had a girlfriend or been on a date and I don't really understand how any of that kind of stuff works.

I am friends with a woman at work and twice last year I asked her if she would like to be friends outside of work.  I'm worried now that she might have thought I was asking her out on a date.  I don't want her to think I'm a creep or a pervert.  I wouldn't do anything like that because, besides the fact that it's generally considered inappropriate to date a coworker, she's something like eleven or twelve years younger than me, and I know people generally think that's inappropriate even though both parties are consenting adults; but really it's because I don't understand what the difference between liking somebody platonically and and liking somebody romantically is supposed to be, or why people go on dates, or how they choose who they would or would not like to see romantically.

I just hope that I haven't made her feel uncomfortable or unsafe, or put her in a situation where she can't tell me to leave her alone because we're at work or just because it's innately dangerous for a woman to tell a man ""no"" in our world.  Nobody deserves that, of course, but she's so special; she's funny, smart, and cool, and she's nicer to me than anybody else in my life.  It's just devastating to think that I'm doing something hurtful towards her.  Seeing her makes me so happy - it might be the only thing in my life that makes me happy.  I just wish we could be friends.

I just don't understand why this is so hard - being around other people, making friends, communicating.  I try so hard to make myself understood.  I have autism, and I struggle so much when people mean something to be rhetorical or sarcastic or humorous.  I always say exactly what I mean, but people tell me I'm too earnest and it makes them uncomfortable.

Why can't somebody just say ""date"" when they mean ""a date?""  People say something other than what they mean, and now I mean something other than what I'm saying.  I hate this."

This rarely happens to white collar workers because (in addition to the fact that an executive's importance - and sometimes salary - is determined by how many flunkies they have under them whether or not they're all actually doing anything, so they can never be downsized) since they don't actually do anything substantial in eight hours, having them stay for twelve isn't going to make a difference.
