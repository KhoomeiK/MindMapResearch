ptsd,fiupt9i,t1_fiuegca,1582746001.0,"As a former emotional and verbal abuser, when I was deep in my symptoms, the very last thing I would recommend is staying if you're being abused. Some of us needed rock bottom, not because we're awful, but because we're so deep in our symptoms...and if our childhood reinforced the bad behavior, it's even harder. I lost everything. I was on the right track at the end, but then I was rammed into rock bottom and finally found the help I needed. If you are privileged enough to have insurance, at least consider intensive out-patient...but only if/when he's ready.

&#x200B;

And if he's not all the way to abuse, then you simply need to work with him to get him into a program that meets his needs and helps him move past the trauma. It IS possible...I'm living proof.

&#x200B;

But HIS issues should not be a reason to accept abuse. Ever."
Watches,fir2ib3,t3_f95vs2,1582656068.0,"Like u/Teddyworks, I have an adjacent watch, the Ray II Raven, which is the all-black version (but with white numbers). I went with Raven because it felt like it was going to be more versatile, and so far, it definitely is. In the Mako, I'd go blue...it's a great blue, and the sunburst is great!"
Watches,fiqpndg,t3_f99ny1,1582649329.0,"My first automatic watch, as I'm just diving in, was an Orient Ray Raven II. I chose it because the in-house movement hacks and hand-winds, which, honestly, are two primary criteria for my purchase. I'd LOVE to say SKX, and it IS a true classic, but it's also primitive. If you're looking for horological significance, the SKX is hard to beat.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER

&#x200B;

You're not pointing to an SKX, and given the list you've provided, I'd say Orient all the way, and then it's more about what you like. My Raven is gorgeous, versatile, and relatively small (I think they say it's 41.5mm, but it wears smaller). 

&#x200B;

I also have a Deep Blue Master 1000 that uses a modern Seiko movement (NH35, iirc), so I get a big, chunky dive watch with 1000' rating, and hacking and handwinding....and if you use either ""DEEP"" or ""BLUE"", you get it for an automatic 40% off (one of the two is supposedly always active). Meaning that my Deep Blue is, essentially, a modern Seiko with a great look...but you have to want chunky. And mine runs about -8spd, which isn't awful. My Raven runs about +2spd for contrast.  


I've found that the 21mm Orient strap size really isn't quite true, and many folks easily fit 22mm bands on them (I have, with no issues)."
Watches,fiomwbn,t3_f8s3i1,1582586344.0,"I gotta say, as a daily rider without a car, I've never worried about what watch I'm wearing. I grab what I fancy that day.

I don't have anything in the four figure range yet, but I won't buy a watch that can't handle my general activities (motorcycles, bikes, hiking, climbing). The one exception is a dress watch, but that's a special case.

Have you had issues? I regularly rock an Orient Ray Raven II, a Deep Blue Master 1000, and a Citizen Flighthawk. Also, I live in Oregon, so I'm not a fair-weather rider."

How is yours doing for time keeping?"
