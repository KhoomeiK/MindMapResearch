NewSkaters,f5vowqr,t3_dpc1qb,1572494895.0,"Looks good to me! The only things I would maybe think of swapping are the trucks and bearings. Ace Trucks aren't bad, but I've personally had poor experiences with bearings by board companies. A good set of Bones Reds is always a great investment."
NewSkaters,f5vofct,t3_dpf8v9,1572494487.0,"Try to lift your upper body as you're popping, pop off the center of the tail with the ball of your foot and jump. You'll feel the board want to spring up, then just slide that foot. Make sure you reeeeally slide it. It looks like you may not be sliding your foot enough and maybe a little too soon. Hope this helps! I'm not that good at explaining things heheh."
NewSkaters,f5vo5mm,t3_dpgnxz,1572494275.0,"I've noticed that if I lift my arms and shoulders right as I'm popping and then condense my body, it helps me get more air and level it out better--as if I'm trying to fly, or swim upwards. That may sound kinda odd but I'm not the best with explaining things haha."

NewSkaters,f5dd8xl,t1_f5dazvt,1572152021.0,"I'm the same way! I wear baggy cargos and a hoodie if the weather accommodates. I live in Texas though and it's only just now starting to cool down, so maybe now I'll have an easier time since I don't have to skate in shorts anymore haha."
mentalhealth,f4sco9m,t1_f4sbdoq,1571776484.0,Fuck off. Talk to who? I reach out constantly and no one considers even thinking of talking to me.
depression,f4sc8aj,t3_dlfw2v,1571776410.0,"At this point I don't even care. No one gives a shit about me and never will so I've learned to just be numb. No matter how much I open up, nothing. No one gives me the light of day."
depression,f4sbtf4,t3_dkt144,1571776299.0,"So everyone is just gonna ignore this post? A post I spent an hour writing about a very personal thing that's been destroying me for a year that I didn't have the confidence to open up about? Yeah, you guys are pieces of shit. This is why I'm killing myself."
mentalhealth,f4sbdad,t3_dkw3r0,1571776172.0,No one? Really? Cool. So much for this being a space for venting. This is why I want to kill myself.

NewSkaters,f3f8nep,t3_dgetnh,1570892112.0,Duuuude this is me constantly. I have to actually force myself to stop thinking of skating while I'm trying to fall asleep because it'll wake me up instantly and make it nearly impossible to fall back asleep.

DecidingToBeBetter,f2wik80,t3_deffyv,1570466213.0,"I'm sort of like this too. I absolutely cannot handle conflict. Whenever I'm alone though, I'm always coming up with things to say in those situations that would shut the other person up, but as soon as it really happens I just go blank, and I hate it. It makes me feel like I'm stronger when I'm by myself, but when I'm out in public I feel like an alien, as if everyone can sniff out that I'm weak."
skateboarding,f22pm01,t3_dbiad6,1569893953.0,Damn with style too
mentalhealth,f22p16e,t3_dbias0,1569893543.0,"Holy shit, yes. I always think ""there are people out there who have a much, much worse life"" and it invalidates my depression constantly, thus making it worse, starting the cycle over again. And over again."
HEB,f1nxkcs,t3_d8tpb4,1569629076.0,"I think if they decided to do a one on one interview with you instead of invite you to a group interview, you're already 10 steps ahead of every other applicant. That's what happened with me, I was offered a group interview by 5 different stores and didn't get hired at either one, but the one that offered a one on one hired me basically on the spot. It just sometimes depends on the amount of spots available. Just stay relaxed, they'll understand that you're nervous and won't hold it against you! You got this. 😊

Edit: Forgot to address the attire part of your question. Honestly I just wore a pair of shorts, a hoodie and a hat and they didn't seem to mind. I'm not saying you shouldn't dress nice because that always helps, but if they can tell you're genuinely interested in the company your attire won't matter much to them. Maybe it's just my store lol. Also if they're urgently hiring, they won't be paying much attention to how you dressed for the interview."

mentalhealth,f1ln9kx,t3_d9swtx,1569560148.0,"I get this constantly. I feel like I have all the tools, all the ability to be a great friend, boyfriend, coworker, brother, son, etc. But I feel like I've always gotten the short end of the stick my whole life. I always ask myself ""of all people, why me? What did I do to deserve being so mistreated and unwanted?"" Then I start thinking that I'm being selfish for thinking those thoughts, and that those problems don't even exist, thus perpetuating the darkness in my head. It's a vicious cycle that I don't think I'll ever get out of, but I know I can learn to cope with it."
