Herpes,fph7dyo,t1_fph735z,1588616273.0,Yes! Even after starting antivirals my outbreak got a little more uncomfortable. Once the burning  pain went away that’s when the major itching started. It was bad like it would keep me up for hours in the night. This was only a few months ago. I had one other outbreak but it was nothing compared to my first one. It just felt kind of like a paper cut and went away quick
Herpes,fph6242,t3_gdfdei,1588615600.0,Mine took about a month! It felt like forever but I was so grateful to not be itchy or in pain lol

Anxiety,fmn8l8g,t3_fvxa4p,1586220504.0,"Me!!! I started thinking about my breathing yesterday and it put me on a funk, my first thought was this is it I have the virus. I was calm this morning but still kept focusing on my breathing. I am still focusing on my breathing and freaking myself out. Hopefully it’s better in the morning. I’m so sorry your going thru this. Remember anxiety is a sensation that we let go to far!!"
Herpes,fmbt9x3,t1_fma9rlq,1585932803.0,Oh my god yeah i first thought it was a yeast infection until bumps came up and i for the lab results back at the beginning of March!!! Yes my anus and inside my vagina is so itchy. It’s horrible. Hard to sleep because I’m up itching through the night most nights and now i feel like I’ve rubbed myself raw in some spots. The peeing is annoying but getting a little better. Everything just feels so swollen i guess inside too where it’s easy to become constipated. I have valacyclovir and I’m bummed because I thought I’d feel better by now.  I never knew herpes caused so many issues. I hope you start feeling better too.. we can get thru this
