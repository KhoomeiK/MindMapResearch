She was the closest friend I‚Äôve ever had and I didn‚Äôt know she was struggling with depression, we were from a country that‚Äôs heavily religious, people didn‚Äôt believe in depression, or didn‚Äôt understand what it is, and suicide was an act that defied God, there was still a huge stigma around it at the time, the day before she committed suicide she visited me at the hospital, I was always sick when I was young, I have a really weak immune system, that night she stayed with me and we both looked up potential prom dresses, I didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôd be the last time that I‚Äôll see her. It was truly heartbreaking, especially when we found out about the note. I didn‚Äôt know how to handle loss, blamed myself for not being able to be there for her. Now 6 years later, it still haunts me. A friend also passed away last year due to a drug overdose, he was in his second year of medical school, he was the only person that I was able to open up about my own grief and thoughts about suicide, his sudden passing reminded me of my friend and I‚Äôm still in pain knowing that I wasn‚Äôt able to help them in the way that they needed. Sometimes you really just feel helpless. I doubt I‚Äôll ever be able to get over their deaths."

I struggled so much after stopping medication and beat myself up because I thought it was good for me, i thought it made me happier but in reality it just made more depressed. 

I love how happy she is and how she‚Äôs finally at peace with happiness. It gave me comfort and hope that things can definitely get better. Honestly it‚Äôs so hard for me to let go of this show. I started watching this back in 2015 while I was still living in another country and now 5 years later halfway across the world from where I first started it, I watched it end. Can‚Äôt even articulate how much this show made me reflect on my life, every new season I learned something about myself and found comfort in knowing that I am not alone in my loneliness."

He‚Äôs a CS major and is about to leave for the navy. Never really expected that this would even be a relationship since we both had different priorities when we first started dating but the chemistry and that connection is just so natural that we couldn‚Äôt stop ourselves from seeing each other.

So far, this has been the best relationship that I‚Äôve been in, rooted in mutual respect and understanding, and I couldn‚Äôt be grateful enough to have found someone like him.
