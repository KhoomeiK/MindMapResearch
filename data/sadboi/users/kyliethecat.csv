The fact that you have been beating yourself up, know you fucked up, and posted this shows you aren‚Äôt an asshole. You just didn‚Äôt know. 

Helpful tip - apologize but also validate her by asking questions and actively listening. Coming to realize one‚Äôs  sexual orientation is a huge part of life. It was amazing for me. I finally knew there wasn‚Äôt anything wrong with me, I wasn‚Äôt broken, and me just being myself without sex is okay. I‚Äôm still human. But all of those realizations become harder to grasp when you have people who are important in your life telling you it‚Äôs all bullshit.

kratom,fphg482,t3_gdfgqh,1588620678.0,"Feeling guilty is completely normal because you are associating Kratom with Vyvanse even though one is completely different from the other. Comparing yourself to others is the easiest way to start feeling bad about yourself. But see: someone could do totally well on Vyvanse, take it as prescribed, and then get totally WRECKED on Kratom. Everyone is different, and if Kratom is helping you to live the life you‚Äôve wanted then try to remember that when you feel guilty. 
I was addicted to heroin for a while, (did not quit with Kratom), but after I quit I still didn‚Äôt feel quite right. I had all types of anxieties and mood swings still. Once I tried Kratom, I realized this is the thing that could fix me. I don‚Äôt get withdrawal from it, I don‚Äôt rob my family for it, and I don‚Äôt base my entire life around it. It‚Äôs simply a little part of my day that tremendously helps me to function.
