insaneparents,fozu7ev,t3_eqvwft,1588196939.0,"As a member of the Mormon church (and soon to be former member), I find this completely INSANE!!! 

I’m 30, married (to a nonmember/Atheist), and I have 4 kids. We live an hour away from my mom. 

Any chance she gets, she tries to convince me to take my husband to church with me and convert my husband. I refuse. I’m not one who tries to shove religion down someone’s throat. It’s annoying and uncalled for. 

Her and my husband got into a whole fallout one night and she told him he was going to rot in hell and how my dad was ashamed of him (my dad passed away before this fallout) and his actions. All he did was say that she was overbearing on me and to let me grow up and be my own adult and to ease back on me with her demands and wants because I have responsibilities of my own.  She went absolutely bonkers on him and proceeded to preach scripture references at him and telling him he’s gonna burn for what he said. 

long story short, I’ve limited communication with my mom now. She’s most of the reason why I’m leaving the church. She kept shoving it down my throat while I was growing up and gave me no choice when attending even while as an adult.  After I got married and moved out, she got other members (of my branch, not hers) to tell her whether I was at church or not. And when she gets informed, I get calls. Not texts. Calls. 

She will leave voicemails saying that’s she’s praying for me and she’s praying extra for my husband and how I should be praying and reading scriptures too. 

Like.....please stop. Let me live MY life and let us live OUR lives in peace."

And like me, a lot of them are struggling too. They’re trying to do what I’m doing as well.  

Telling me to grow up on here is probably the most immature thing a person can do. Maybe you need to grow up yourself."
