As someone who's beaten depression multiple times,

Keep on reminding yourself of what drives you forward. Even if you feel nothing for it. Just fake your desire for it. Over time, you will slowly regain your drive and passion for what you wanna do. Hence, fake it and you'll make it.

Don't let anxiety hold you back. Anxiety is frustrating to deal with but if you keep on letting yourself feeling anxious while doing the thing that made you anxious in the first place, you'll train your mind to be calmer and the anxiety over that thing will decrease.

Look at your past troubles as motivation in a way. Defeating your demons could give your life new meaning.

Lastly,

Live life facing forward. Remember what you went through and let it give you momentum for a brighter future.

Good luck, you Warrior."

We are treated as disposable, meaning we are often the meat shield for everything bad in media. The misandry is basically skyrocketing nowadays.

It's always the guy that gets hit.

Males are portrayed as sex offenders, perverts, creeps, molesters, rapists, pedophiles, etc.. I understand that most of those types of people in the world are male, but at times, the portrayal never gets offset by good men and you just end up feeling like you're being attacked for things that the incels that plague our gender have done.

There's toxic masculinity in which we have to have that macho-man muscular appearance and be an absolute badass who shows no emotion.

We are also portrayed as being narcissistic, sadistic, greedy, lazy, rich, powerful evil, perverted, psychopathic, gluttonous, creepy, scary, mean, cruel, asshole, careless, etc...

Whats fine is having a male character that is all that to make him a villain, but whats not okay is to not offset it with a good guy who is the opposite. Cause then it just portrays a message that men are evil.

It's sad that there are so many assholes that plague the male gender to the point where society hates us regardless if we had anything to do with it or not. When some fucker does something bad, even the really good guys get dragged down with the bad guy.
