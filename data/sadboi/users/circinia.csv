It's impossible to give that in a general post, since it has to be specific to people's individual situations - reading generalizations about depression or suicidality usually leaves people feeling more alienated. (Hearing ""people should talk to people who are depressed"" isn't the same thing as having someone actually listen to your experience!) 

As the post I linked above notes, in the best evidence-based model we have, alienation is one of the key factors that increases suicide risk, so we try to avoid things that we know frequently alienate people here. 

One of the other key factors for suicide risk is a sense of failure - by pressuring people who are already struggling to reach out to others struggling when they're overwhelmed themselves, you're likely to increase their sense of failure and also to potentially increase their risk.

This isn't to say that there's anything wrong with encouraging people to be more understanding of others and supportive of people who are depressed - just that a depression support space, *where people are already aware of depression and that people need support*, is exactly the wrong place for it and pushes down the posts of people who are struggling and reaching out for help for themselves."

I'd be glad to do anything I can to help with your questions - we welcome anyone who's struggling with suicidal thoughts for any reason to talk here. 

I also wanted to let you know about /r/rapecounseling - they're a community especially for survivors of sexual assault. [Their sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/about/sidebar) also has links to resources for survivors and other subreddits that might be helpful as well."

SuicideWatch,fpq6ty3,t3_gewauo,1588816338.0,"Hi, I'm not sure if you posted this because you're looking for support for suicidal thoughts or if you wanted to offer it?

I had to take this down since we aren't able to allow ""here to help"" posts, but if you're looking for support you're welcome to repost.

We don't like having to use bans - we only do so when someone's already done serious harm and the chance of their continuing to do it is high enough that we wouldn't be honoring either the needs of the community, which we have to prioritize over any one person, or the person's own good intentions by allowing them to post.

I've explained the reasons for the ban here but we can discuss it further in modmail if you want and are interested in understanding more - all the mods can see it and offer any additional perspective that they think would be helpful."

awakened,fpoxp7q,t1_fpov4oz,1588792452.0,"As I mentioned above, we've unfortunately had serious problems with people coming to the subreddit and using highly inappropriate strategies as a result of this thread.

Encouraging others to come to the sub without taking the time to check how to help is actually even more dangerous than providing inappropriate support yourself, unfortunately - one part of being knowledgeable about mental health support is knowing that well-intentioned bad support can be worse than nothing.

We're willing to work with people who'd like to take the time to try to fully understand why the policies we have are necessary to avoid contributing to suicide deaths and other negative outcomes, but I'm afraid that doesn't seem to be what you're asking to do."
SuicideWatch,fpogf7h,t3_gej9gv,1588784062.0,"We have no judgment for suicidal thoughts here. We try to provide as much support as possible to ease the pain, so that people can have the option of living while suffering less. But it's not about judging anyone, which doesn't help living feel any better, as you've found...

This sub is just for support for personal experiences, though - unfortunately posts that are primarily about philosophy (even when we have a deeply personal reason for needing to talk about it) draw more discussion/debate than personal support so I've had to take this down. 

If you'd like to make another post just about what's going on for you though you're very welcome to."

Honoring where people are in their experiences without trying to fix or project our own answers onto them is tragically not the norm everywhere in our world, and a lot of what's popularly thought to be ""how to handle this"" is actually harmful. 

So that's why we have to ask everyone who comes to our sub to take the time to learn, even and *especially* if they think they already know how."

This happens even when the OP specifically asks people to read the rules - unfortunately in this case no one in the thread has done so and it's creating even more trouble for us :-(

And sometimes being less alone with the uncertainty is the best that's possible for us in the moment - especially because even if things might get better later that doesn't necessarily diminish how hard they are right now...

I had suicidal thoughts running through my head for years also - and yeah, it gets draining hearing them loop over and over again, and I can definitely relate to the ""how much longer can I cope with this?"" feeling...

I did have to take this down just because we aren't able to allow people to make ""here to help"" posts or offer PM help as a first resort, but you're welcome to repost if you'd like without that."

SuicideWatch,fplredk,t3_ge7cz2,1588718025.0,"It's very common to be conflicted about suicide - to have part of ourselves that's having intense, serious thoughts about wanting to die, and another part of ourselves that has plans for the future and might want to be able to live them out if we make it through. So you're definitely far from alone in this.

Unfortunately, I'm not able to let this post through just because posts that informally survey others about their suicidal thoughts in the title generally result in poor-quality support for both the OP and other community members.

Many other support subreddits also have a ""helpers should not invite DMs as a first resort""-type rule - over on /r/depression there's a sticky post explaining it in detail.

Offering support privately makes people more vulnerable to trolls, people with bad advice, and suicide voyeurs, and makes it harder for the community and moderators to give the best support they can. Also, if someone truly *is* giving good support, far more people will benefit if they do so in public."
