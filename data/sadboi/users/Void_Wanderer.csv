explainlikeimfive,fr512g0,t3_gmhbes,1589900592.0,"My answer is based on my experience and it might not be what you expect, But I contemplated this same concept a lot for that reason:

I like to experiment with drugs, Many people go through a drug experimntation phase in their lives. One unique class of drugs, Serotonergic psychedelics, Like LSD, Psilocybin and DMT, MRI mapping of brains influenced by psychs show connections between regions in the brain that normally do not contact each other directly.

On several trips on LSD after coming up, I suddenly gain access to memories of neurological cognitive processes that were made before using the LSD. Those memories I suddenly gained access to felt like I always had them, That they are my own memories, Even though I couldn't consciously realize or identify those memories when I'm not influenced by psychs, It felt extremely strange and it's impossible to explain to someone who hadn't experienced them.

So I think in our brains there's another subconscious self that analyzes and processes some cognitive info for our consciousness to use and be the way it is. That subconsciousness is a part of us, But at the same time not really, It works like a computer, According to it's nature, It doesn't comprehend info or orders from the conscious self or it doesn't follow them.

All of this might sound strange, But you see, All forms of life and their existence are a strange mystery, And we don't really understand it or understand consciousness at all."

Drugs,fpivqt0,t1_fpigf9r,1588649841.0,"I learned to never form an opinion about any particular drug or what it must feel like based solely on other people's experiences without trying it myself. My personal experiences with many substances have been very different from the common consensus around them.

This has been the case with too many drugs to list, But DXM has been one of the drugs with which this happened to the greatest extent. Having the most magical, Life changing euphoria of my life to then find so many people saying how dysphoric and uncomfortable they felt on the same substance, Even those who used it in pure form, And finding most of the positive reports saying it's fun but 'meh' and that they'd do something else if they had access, Has been quite mind boggling.

Then there are the drugs people rave about how amazing and euphoric they felt on them, That when I eventually got to try, Found them fun but nothing really spectacular.

With all that said, I disagree with a lot of this. The majority of anecdotal reports online on Memantine are positive, Without major variability as with things like DXM. A minority of reports say it wasn't enjoyable, But those experiences aren't at all more common than with every other substance.

Memantine also isn't extensively studied or completely understood at all. I tried looking for the studies in which animals chose DXM over Memantine and couldn't find any. Only studies I found were on it's dependency suppressing or addiction treating qualities with alcohol, Nicotine and some opioids. Not saying those don't exist, But would appreciate if you could give me a link to one of them.

Furthermore, Memantine has been found to be generally well tolerated in therapeutic doses, And almost all anecdotal reports report a clean dissociative experience without many side effects even ones that are common with dissociatives like confusion and motor control loss.

And even though as I said I absolutely love DXM, I can't deny how physically uncomfortable it can be or the extent to which it's side effects can affect the experience, So it's quite odd reading that you think Memantine has more side effects than it?

Also, Having been studied as a replacement for Codeine in cough preparations, DXM itself has been found to not cause addiction before it was approved, So if studies concluding it's non-addictive are out there, That probably wouldn't mean much depending on the standards they used to rule out it's addiction potential.

Sorry this reply turned out much longer than intended, But this comment just contradicts everything I learned researching the drug for hours the last few days. Maybe it's recreational, Maybe it isn't. In the end there's only one way to find out! Dosing 100 mgs as I'm typing this so wish me luck!"

In that case, You took around 600 mgs of DXM, And that's a lot especially if you're averge-light weight, Might even get you to a low 3rd plat. IME the full stomach won't affect the potency because DXM lasts long enough that an extended onset won't make noticeable difference, But it might take up to 3 hours to peak.

Elaborate? What diseases are you talking about? Why do you think diseases 'work' a particular way, As if there's a universal standard to which all diseases adhere?

>basically the least at risk for Covid

That's a bit inaccurate. Being a certain age doesn't make you any more or less likely to get the disease, You're just far more likely to recover without complications if you're relatively young and healthy compared to the older population."
dissociatives,fp7aatm,t3_gbi5hq,1588366890.0,"My best guess is that you're trying to use dissociatives the same way you've been using other drugs, Which most likely have primarily been stimulants -as you said- and possibly opioids, Benzodiazepines, Alcohol and the likes.

What you're expecting when you use a drug is to dose up and go along with your day, Maybe pop bars and hang out with friends, Or snort a line or two then dance your ass off at the club, Or take an addy before work.

Well, As with the majority of hallucinogens, Dissociatives^(\*) are not like that. You can not expect to go on with your day on Ketamine, DCK or DXM. Dissociatives shatter your reality, And create a *world of pure imagination* instead. You don't take dissociatives to directly feel good, Like opioids, Or more awake/confident, Like stims, You to take a step out and observe life from the outside, To focus on the inner world within, Instead of the external, Material world. Dissociatives are best enjoyed in your room on your bed, Listening to your music or maybe watching TV.

IMHO no other class of drugs can be as beautiful or magical as a good dissociative experience can (especially a good disso-psych combo).

^(\*Well most of them, Things like 3-MeO-PCP and some of the more stimulating dopaminergic dissociatives could be functional and social, But still not ideal for that because you'll be at least a little manic and you'll make some poorly-thought decisions.)"

Which is my point. Of course I don't know anything about OP or what they personally meant and that's not really even relevant, Because seeing as this is a school project that OP chose, Which means OP probably chose this from a set of topics for the project, Topics chosen by his teacher / supervisor or other school staff, Then drug use = drug abuse here, They don't have that -*correct*\- distinction you're expecting them to, Which is the main point of my original comment.

AskDrugNerds,foys6v8,t3_gaau01,1588178194.0,"While you probably will only choose the answers that your supervisor wants to see, Which I probably would've too if I were you, But here are my answers, As well as some reasons why I think those questions are invalid:

>Drug abusers of Reddit, what kept you from searching help?

See, This question presumes -or insinuates- that if you use drugs, Then you consequently need help. You already established that and moved on to ask why you don't seek it, So answering that will necessarily involve my acceptance of your presumption.

>What keeps teenage drug addicts from searching help?

Here's another presumption. Teenagers who use drugs and are not willing to stop are addicts, But why don't they ask for help with their addiction?

You completely neglected the possibility that perhaps those 'addicts' don't really have a problem with their drug use, As if you can't enjoy this habit responsibly in moderation, Like you can't have it under control and not wish to give up that part of your life.

Given that in most cases you can't both be a truly responsible user and a teen since your brain hasn't fully developed, But that's beside the point.

This should've been the presumed answer to your question, Addicts who refuse help being the exception, And my answer to that is most of them do seek help when they're desperate enough, But that depends on their DOC, As things like heroin and meth can really make them not care enough that their lives are falling apart to but the effort into recovery, Or not even realize it altogether.

But what I think is the reason some users refuse getting help, Is because of how ignorant those who offer help seem. When rehab websites warn people of LSD addiction or perma-trips, And then people come to realize that most of it was a big load of false, Addiction recovery lose all of their credibility, People won't take info from you even accurate info.

There's also this superiority complex -intentional or not- many never-drug users have towards drug users, Even alcoholics and smokers ironically, The direct result of all the unnecessary stigmatizing. Would you seek the help of someone who has always been condescendingly patronizing you against drug use, Who clearly doesn't even know much at all about drugs?"
