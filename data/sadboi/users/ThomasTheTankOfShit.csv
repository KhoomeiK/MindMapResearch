depression,f1imnra,t1_f1ikqq8,1569512361.0,"Yeah, I think that’s where this was all going too! My anxiety was acting up so bad that it made me start questioning my everything and damn that got intense. I’m excited for this. I’m ready to be a new me with a fresh out look on life with my fiancé. She is such a saint and I’d be nowhere near the man I am today without her! Thank you very much :) also, yeah, I thoroughly enjoy my username xD"

Anxiety,eufj2z6,t3_cg13bj,1563776460.0,"When I was on meds I used to dissociate hard. For me it’s more like nothing feels real. Even myself. Everything, especially my own thoughts, feel foreign and not of my own. I’d be super dizzy. I’d even have this thing where my eyes would literally feel like... fuzzy? I can’t describe it... but they’d feel like that and sometimes I’d get hit with a random blast of dizziness. All I could do was just let it pass. Nothing I ever did made it better. I just tried to go on with whatever I was doing even though the brain fog and everything else made it so hard. I don’t feel that anymore, luckily, but seriously, you’re not alone. Don’t feel like your strange feelings are because something is wrong with you. It’s generally just the anxiety and it took me a long time to realize that. Stay strong, OP. You got this."
Anxiety,esmwt5q,t3_c8gayd,1562116856.0,Congratulations! I don’t know you but I’m proud of you! I always find that not canceling things and actually going through with plans tends to make me feel a lot better mentally. It just gives a sense of pride and accomplishment that staying home and doing nothing could never do.

depression,esjzbic,t3_c82ggr,1562046275.0,"I do it a lot while at work. (I work 12 hour nights in a factory... gives me plenty to fuel my depression.) I tend to hope that if people see I’m down again they’ll just leave me alone and not talk to me... it doesn’t work but hey, at least some people care, I guess."
