I was clearly depressed, yet (unmedicated I got the big sad every 3 months) but I had also been told I was getting a medical board discharge for my injuries that prevented me from graduating my second mos. 
After I got out, my VA assigned psychologist told me to go for walks, so I stopped listening to her. 
Oddly enough my psychiatrist I was only seeing for med management helped me the most...but they fired her and I didn’t know where she left. 
Now I don’t wanna go to therapy and I don’t. My new primary care doctor has worked with bipolar patients for 17 years so I trust her more than I’ve ever trusted a primary care. While it’s not therapy, it’s what I have and it works.
