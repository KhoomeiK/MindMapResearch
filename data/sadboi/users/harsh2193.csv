Secondly, this is t even shoddy journalism. This is a screenshot of a comment on a Reddit thread I saw yesterday on the PlayStation or ps5 subreddit. Lots of things are inaccurate because it's someone who isn't a tech journalist talking about things he doesn't entirely understand. Nothing wrong with it there, that's most people on this sub, including me because we talk about what we know and hopefully learn when new information comes up.

This post however was made to look like a piece of journalism (intentionally or not) and that's what's leading to all the confusion."
