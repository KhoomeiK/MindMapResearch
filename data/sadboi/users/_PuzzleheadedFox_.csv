BeautyBoxes,f7n0z25,t3_dwxt6p,1573880137.0,I'm going to be taking a break from my skincare/make up subscriptions and focus more on the boxes that include some lifestyle items instead. My collection has gotten large enough and I've tried enough things that I generally know what I like and what will work for me. At this point I think I'm better off spending my money on specific beauty items at Sephora and Ulta vs. the random items that beauty boxes send. I was able to buy the new Pat McGrath limited edition Divine Rose palette today and it didn't impact my budget much because I've already saved so much money by canceling most of my beauty boxes.
BeautyBoxes,f7e1azj,t1_f7czmtt,1573641427.0,"I got the same box today! I'm really surprised by the palette. I only did finger swatches, but the shadows are pretty good and the colors are nice."

BeautyBoxes,f5z4d3p,t3_dpnvrb,1572566801.0,What's the best way to do this so I only get the fall box and not the winter box? Should I just make a new account and cancel it after a few days or should I wait for shipping confirmation?
muacirclejerk,f5paane,t1_f5p9d07,1572354030.0,I believe she is currently living in LA. I think the roof caved in on her house in Florida so I think she said she's in LA while they're doing repairs.

BeautyBoxes,f57zpcq,t1_f57y3eq,1572046069.0,It is $10 a month plus tax. I live in California so it comes out to $10.80 for me.
BeautyBoxes,f57y9uf,t1_f57xuv3,1572045328.0,"I've never e-mailed them for support, I always call. I also find that the main line is more helpful than the rouge line. You could try calling them and mention that you've seen other people get refunds for their box."

I've tried this primer before and I've liked it so I'm happy to get it again!

**Tarte Water Foundation Broad Spectrum SPF 15 - Rainforest of the Sea Collection in 12B Fair Beige**

I'm not sure if this will work or be too dark, but it's a good amount so I'm happy with it! If it ends up being too dark then I'll just buy a white mixer which has been on my list for a while.

**BeautyBlender Bounce Liquid Whip Long Wear Foundation in 110 N** 

This came expired, so I called Sephora's customer service line and they ended up refunding me the cost of the entire box and also gave me 150 points! I ended up throwing it away which is why it isn't in the picture.

**Make Up For Ever Matte Velvet Skin Full Coverage Foundation in Y205 Alabaster**

I think this shade will work on me and I've wanted to try Make Up Forever foundations so I'm glad that I got this!

**Urban Decay All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray**

This is an HG item for me. I already have a back up so now I have another one.

**Morroccanoil Night Body Serum (Bonus Sample)**

I'm excited to try this! I'm overflowing with perfume samples so even though I love them this was a nice change.

&#x200B;

Overall I'm happy with my box and very happy with customer service. I don't think that I've ever had a negative experience with their customer service yet. I did find it weird that they had an all foundation box, but I'm lucky that the shades might match me so I should be able to get use out of them."

BeautyBoxes,f53yo5l,t3_dmkpwq,1571966753.0,I'm definitely going through product overload at the moment. It's not really exciting to look at many boxes anymore because I don't need anything. I have been looking at signing up for more lifestyle boxes. I have so much makeup and skincare that it's almost like a giant collection. I think it's kind of an addiction.
BeautyBoxes,f53oxld,t1_f53kkf7,1571962251.0,We'll see how they do with shipping this time around. Hopefully it's good. This is going to be their first box on a new billing and shipping schedule.

This is the choice item that I picked and I'm so happy about it! I was actually looking at buying it at full price recently so I'm really happy that got it.

**Jolii Cosmetics Spektra Stick in Stella**

This is a pretty color, but it's too dark for me. Also the packaging feels very cheap. I do not believe this is worth $26 at all. I don't know if I can still donate this since I swatched it so it might need to be thrown away.

**Touch In Sol No Poreblem Priming Water**

I'm happy that I got this! I've tried their products before, but not their primers so I'm looking forward to using it.

**Betty Boop x Ipsy That's So Betty Eyeshadow Palette**

I don't really need any eyeshadow palettes so I was planning on donating it, but I swatched it and it's really bad. It might work with a wet brush, but it doesn't swatch well with a finger so I don't know. I don't think it's good enough to donate so I'll probably just throw this away.

**F.A.R.A.H Brushes Midnight Pro Trio**

I have a lot of makeup brushes already so I'm probably going to donate these.

**Betty Boop Make up Bag**

I think this actually pretty cute and I'll use it so I'm glad I got it!

&#x200B;

Overall I'm pretty happy with what I received. I feel like I got a good deal since the Dr. Brandt and Touch in Sol would equal about $102.00 if I bought them at retail. The makeup bag is a nice bonus that I'm going to use. I'm very disappointed in the Betty Boop palette and I hope that they don't do many collaborations going forward."

Even though the products are small there is usually enough for me to decide if I like it or not. All the brands have been great except for when they sent out supplements.

Their customer service is awful. If you can get a hold of them the responses are often copy and paste. Each time you e-mail them back, a new person will respond so it's necessary to re explain your problem with each e-mail.

I only subscribe when there is a good subscription gift that I want since that is at least guaranteed or when I'm okay with all of the variations. Once I get my box I cancel and wait and see for the next month."
