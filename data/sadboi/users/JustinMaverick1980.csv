Anxiety,fos7k3d,t3_g9aei1,1588025400.0,I feel the same way for days on end and then I feel ok for awhile then right back to it... I've been through the heart attack tests more than once and they never find anything wrong so I'm gonna say it is possible and you are definitely not alone
hearthstone,fopdzd7,t1_foodnih,1587959093.0,Does that apply to budget players or do you have to play tier one decks filled with legendary cards?
hearthstone,fopdvjj,t3_g8eu9x,1587959018.0,I've never hit legend... never even got past 10 in the old system and got matched with a legend player yesterday... is that mmr? Seems a little off
Anxiety,fohpnxd,t3_g6u4dj,1587770227.0,I screenshot this and it is now the wallpaper for my phone... I cant tell you how much this helps me when I'm trapped in my own head... thank you very much
hearthstone,fo32xhl,t1_fo32brh,1587479533.0,Yes I got that and I dont disagree but that's also like saying theres no bad decks... this meta is very deck specific and skill level while being very important doesn't mean you aren't just playing decks that dont work well in this meta
hearthstone,fo31cqf,t1_fo318td,1587478656.0,Thanks dumbass... not sure how far I could've gone without that special advice

I think it might just be a grind it out situation but I also dont think gold 5 is a bad rank considering I play only budget decks"
hearthstone,fo2uo58,t1_fo2ucpj,1587474521.0,I have all the dh legends but not many big legends past that class is the gala warlock pretty dust heavy?
hearthstone,fo2tx34,t3_g59ocv,1587473994.0,None of the nerfs do anything for demon hunter because all the minions have 2 health... there is so much 2 health removal none of these cards live longer than the turn you lay them down
hearthstone,fnrhs2l,t3_g36qsd,1587189353.0,What about plague of flames for 1 mana? That needs to be a 3 mana card at least

hearthstone,fn1gm9w,t1_fn1g60h,1586561594.0,It's the same thing dude... you copy one broken card over and over
hearthstone,fn1fxa6,t1_fn1eduk,1586561186.0,Wouldn't happen to have a deck code for that gem would you?
hearthstone,fn1b65a,t1_fn1a6ct,1586558420.0,Yeah not many classes other than priest have mass dispels
hearthstone,fn1920g,t3_fyhuf1,1586557216.0,I honestly cant explain what I'm experiencing... I've played probably 40-50 matches and I've won 4... 4! Not because of priest (even though that resurrection shit is cancer) but the meta itself is like super hard at the moment
hearthstone,fn0x30z,t1_fn0wy4t,1586550438.0,That's the problem... unless you are highlander counter you dont have the room for crap cards that help against that mess

hearthstone,fn0ks8j,t1_fn0kibq,1586543759.0,It really does lol guarantee the only people winning are people with a shit ton of legendaries
hearthstone,fn0aykt,t1_fn0av6t,1586538620.0,Yeah I've been getting destroyed no matter what deck I use
hearthstone,fn09ghn,t1_fn098a5,1586537844.0,Yeah you gotta go hard and fast at face but you have to do it before turn 5 or your cucked
hearthstone,fn03yrg,t3_fyhuf1,1586535028.0,Thank god I hit gold 5 before the expansion dropped at least I'll get something at the end of the season... has anyone had any luck climbing ladder since? Even running DH blizzard has that good good rng to match you with a control counter deck
hearthstone,fn00hsq,t1_fn0082r,1586533178.0,Well my deck is self built so clearly it's not a meta breaker but that priest deck (resurrect or quest or whatever the hell they call it) is too much is there any counter deck to that?

hearthstone,fmwl9xf,t1_fmwk1wy,1586448604.0,Yeah I feel like it's a high price to pay for a poop card you can get with luck
hearthstone,fmw1edu,t1_fmvxthp,1586437223.0,Yeah I've come to terms with the fact I'm stuck at gold 5 for the rest of the season so might as well have some fun and try new stuff
hearthstone,fmvvnt9,t1_fmvuklo,1586432490.0,Is invocation worth crafting? I mean what's the best that can come out of it? 2 fireballs or if you can get it out for zero mana maybe a pyro blast
hearthstone,fmrm1fo,t3_fx18zt,1586327426.0,That 5 mana 10/6 needs nerfed immediately! I haven't won a game since the expansion dropped
hearthstone,fmpc15m,t1_fmpbwe8,1586278153.0,Lol I'm at the point now as soon as I see one of those cards I just concede... fuck spending 20 minutes on that dumb deck
hearthstone,fmpaxlx,t3_fwnnpz,1586277615.0,Yeah there are a lot of stale decks out there... I'm not exactly looking forward to getting stomped by sweaty demon hunter decks either but at least its something different to see
hearthstone,fmpaprd,t1_fmpak8i,1586277518.0,It won't be bad I just hope people get interested in other cards and leave those horrible decks alone

Doometernal,flm53vz,t1_flm4zht,1585274786.0,Lol its relentless dude I haven't played a game that intense in a long time I dont even know what to compare it to maybe diablo 3 as far as intensity for me
Doometernal,fllzrey,t3_fplp66,1585271275.0,I wish! That cocksucker made me eat my own ass about 20 times!! Thanks for adding him to the game Bethesda I hope you all get explosive diarrhea
Doometernal,fllzg0k,t1_fllvsk1,1585271069.0,I am tempted to try it... I just beat the game like 4 minutes ago and all I can say is holy hell!! That is probably the hardest game I've ever played

Doometernal,fll4d6t,t1_fll46fy,1585253394.0,Well said... couldn't agree more

Doometernal,flju5vj,t1_fljtjo7,1585226630.0,Having said that I think a difficulty jump is really the only re-play value the game has so I can see myself jumping back into it at some point on a higher difficulty
Doometernal,fljtjo7,t1_fljqtx5,1585226123.0,Better you than me bro... I have all the challenge I need on normal mode and then some
Doometernal,fljhnyl,t1_fljh9aa,1585212987.0,Dude I know exactly how you feel I jumped it down to easy mode and it's still more than a challenge... that nightmare shit is just for soulsborne reddit trolls to pat themselves on the back lol I play games to enjoy them not die a million fucking times and rage out
Doometernal,fljclt9,t3_fojn30,1585206876.0,Save your money dude it's just unnecessary rage
Doometernal,fljbc7j,t1_flj42qo,1585205441.0,What do you mean by single run? And nightmare mode is definitely not for me dude I find all the challenge I need in a game on normal mode 99% of the time.
Doometernal,flid9dx,t1_fliccuf,1585180119.0,Yeah I got past him and hot the crucible and now theres another one... I am never gonna get through this damn game at this rate... 15 hours campaign my ass

Doometernal,fl84ixl,t1_fl80akd,1584915713.0,Yeah this game is super hard dude but you eventually find a groove... it took me halfway through the game to finally go a whole level without getting completely wrecked
Doometernal,fl7yewf,t3_fn6otx,1584912034.0,"I know exactly how you feel I'm playing on too young to die and I just finally got my head out of my ass and figured things out
1. Chainsaw and flame belch are very important to keep you armored up and stocked with ammo
2. Move at all times when in a horde the demons are relentless as fuck and will not let you get a free shot
3. Take advantage of weak points as much as possible and take advantage of the ice bomb as well it really gives you a chance to catch your breath 
Good luck brother lol"
Doometernal,fl7o0u2,t1_fl7nwo1,1584905732.0,Lol thanks... I've played every doom game and love the gameplay doom 2016 being my favorite but this game is on a whole different level of crazy
Doometernal,fl7ntz2,t1_fl7l64r,1584905616.0,Yeah I just killed the 2nd priest without dying so maybe I'm starting to figure things out a little
Doometernal,fl7kyjz,t1_fl7jbzh,1584903893.0,Yeah but that's easier when you have some space... when you get into the hordes it gets pretty tuff not to just run for your life
Doometernal,fl7i9y0,t1_fl7i41l,1584902300.0,Maybe... I cant aim for shit and the difficulty doesnt give you room to breathe
Doometernal,fl6zv5o,t3_fmltyb,1584889566.0,"Do you guys remember beating Doom 2016 and thinking ""man that was awesome! I really hope the next game is dark souls with guns!"" Because I sure don't lol save that super difficult shit for the sweaty soulsborne players who like to die a million times... easy mode (if you can call it that) on this game is harder than normal mode of Doom 2016... who asked for that? You had a great game in Doom 2016 why change it so much that even the easy mode is a struggle?"
Doometernal,fl6ze4y,t1_fl64pyk,1584889020.0,I agree 100% the difficulty jump is just unnecessary and its ruining the experience for a lot of players
Doometernal,fl6yzsx,t1_fl6ounp,1584888557.0,Yeah I definitely dont use that enough and I slack on the chainsaw as well... I have to re-evaluate my playstyle once I jump back on the sticks I hope the story picks up as well so far it's kinda flat
Doometernal,fl6yt0x,t1_fl6p7mm,1584888337.0,Absolutely! I was gonna say fallen order lol that map was horrible
Doometernal,fl683de,t1_fl66nd3,1584857695.0,"Someone else said something similar and I'm trying to figure out what I can do differently.  I find myself constantly forgetting about the flame belch (it's a new mechanic so that's understandable) but other than that I dont really see many ways to change my play style.  Doom is not a precision aiming shooter, never has been... so expecting players to shoot off a tiny turret or shoulder cannons seems a little bit too much to ask when you have 10 different demons in a room all trying to rip you to shreds.  I dont think weak points are a bad thing it just doesnt seem like theres time to breathe long enuff to pull it off if that makes sense"
Doometernal,fl67m5i,t1_fl661b8,1584857196.0,Yeah it's a little harsh... I wrote this 5 minutes after I rage quit lol
Doometernal,fl64lt7,t3_fmtvb8,1584854271.0,Doom 2016 was a fantastic game... this doesn't even come close.  Its hard as fuck for no reason and the story is dog shit
Doometernal,fl64f29,t1_fl646n0,1584854098.0,I know exactly how you feel bro... I just rage quit myself lol Doom 2016 was such an awesome game and I have no clue what made Bethesda think we want the next game to be hard as fuck even on easy mode... after I beat it (if I can) I'm definitely trading it in... I dont think multiplayer is worth keeping it
Doometernal,fl55exh,t1_fl55ays,1584828890.0,How bad are the slayer gates? I found one but I feel like going in there is suicide lol
Doometernal,fl549u9,t1_fl545w1,1584828151.0,Yeah I'm only a few hours in and its starting to get more manageable
Doometernal,fl53fhc,t1_fl4v5mm,1584827608.0,You beat it already? How long is the campaign? I respect the fact its difficult but even the easiest mode feels like a constant struggle for health.  Its intense combat but it might be a little bit much
Doometernal,fl52b79,t3_fml23a,1584826894.0,I will say one thing... the map is fucking fantastic! Haha
Doometernal,fl529vw,t1_fl51j2t,1584826871.0,Me too bro... it feels way harder than it should be! I'm constantly in danger of dying and it feels like the aiming is off too from doom 2016
Doometernal,fl51eb1,t1_fl50gp4,1584826302.0,"Yeah it definitely is a more ""think through the situation"" style of combat but let's be honest Doom isn't exactly known for precision aiming lol"
Doometernal,fl4y09p,t1_fl4uh4d,1584824104.0,Yeah I agree so far it's a little too much to handle I feel like Doom 2016 played much better
Doometernal,fl4wy4b,t1_fl4vllp,1584823403.0,Even the easiest mode is harder than normal mode on doom 2016
Doometernal,fl4sls9,t1_fl4l5mg,1584820481.0,Agreed... 2016 was much better so far.  I dont remember anyone asking Bethesda for extreme difficulty.  The level design and aiming felt better in Doom 2016 as well
jedifallenorder,fkmp2af,t3_fjf478,1584335094.0,The controls for combat and just movement in general for this game are way too sloppy and broken to play on grandmaster dude good luck with that

jedifallenorder,fkmmhjk,t1_fkk0v2p,1584332904.0,It's worse than zelda in a water dungeon
jedifallenorder,fkmmg53,t3_fixiga,1584332872.0,The map in general is just hard to follow.  It reminds me of the Doom 2016 map only bad lol
jedifallenorder,fke3q7y,t1_fkd6b2k,1584104368.0,Yeah sliding and swinging with the controls the way they are was just a horrible idea... dodging and parry is really bad but hopefully they learn from those mistakes for the sequel the game has a lot of potential
jedifallenorder,fke31z7,t1_fkdsejj,1584103854.0,I agree 100% the game is definitely good but with tighter controls and a little TLC it would be great
jedifallenorder,fkaqoqg,t3_fhbbz3,1584017022.0,You guys don't feel like the parry system is off a little bit? Especially when there are multiple enemies or single enemies that attack multiple times? There seems to be a window after a good parry where Cal just locks up and can't counter attack... I just feel like they could tighten the combat up easily with a simple patch
jedifallenorder,fk527tk,t3_fg7ehk,1583872057.0,I want to like this game and beat it but the controls are total garbage

funimation,fc1nyjl,t3_eflp7u,1577324389.0,I would give it a watch if the streaming service would actually work once in a while
funimation,fc1ky7m,t1_fc1kppg,1577321870.0,Yeah I noticed it works good on my phone but on the playstation it's hot sweaty garbage... I can screen mirror it from my phone to my tv but that just ties up my phone... it's all way harder than it should be
funimation,fc1ke2a,t1_fc1jkev,1577321389.0,Yeah I feel like for as big as funimation is in the English dub world they should probably have the means to make a better service
