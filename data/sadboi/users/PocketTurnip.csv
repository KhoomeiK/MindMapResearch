Edit: I am now in a loving monogamous relationship. We both have had casual sex in the past, and a lot. When we started dating, it felt completely different: it's full of love and caring for each other, and can't in any way be compared to our past experiences. I do agree sex with someone you love does bring a special bound, and that one shouldn't have sex without feeling some sort of connection, but I don't think such connection should be limited to that of love. People have always had sex for a myriad of reasons, including biological urges, attraction, passion, chemistry among others.
