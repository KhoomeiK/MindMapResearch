You sound like you are taking it well. HSV2 has more of a psychological impact than a physical one. The better your attitude is, the better you will be at disclosure. 

Welcome to the club, always a party.

Edit: per google 
Study data shows that people with symptomatic herpes who take valacyclovir are almost 50% less likely to transmit the virus to others than non-medicated people with herpes. In one study, the HSV-2 acquisition rate was reduced from 3.6% to 1.9% using valacyclovir treatment."

I’ve told 3 people in my family and maybe 2 friends. The friends were on a need to know basis (explaining a reason behind my animosity towards someone). One other friends boyfriend, because he made a crack about a girl in the bar that “she looks like the kind of girl that would have herpes”. So, I responded by saying oh yeah? Do I look like the kind of girl that would have herpes? When he said no, I said well, I do. And I got it from one of his buddies. Didn’t identify the culprit. 

One of my nieces used my computer & saw my Yahoo groups, the other because she thought she had molliscum or HSV, wasn’t sure, & I told my mother because 2nd niece is a psycho who would have used it against me. Other than that, unless it’s a potential partner, they don’t need to know. Oh, and I told my daughter because she was making tacky herpes jokes and I got sick of it. Maybe they told everyone, I have no idea. No one has ever questioned why I’m not coupled up. 

I feel the same as you about ever finding a cure. I believe it’s been back burnered, will never be a priority because it’s not deadly, it’s just an “irritating skin condition”. And while that is true, it has a tremendous impact on your psychological well being and quality of life. Until you decide that you’re not going to let it. That takes time, believe me. I’ve had it since 1996. It still takes way too much of my mental energy, especially now with too much time to spend on social media. I think it probably does take more of a toll on guys because of your role in the relationship game. Even though it’s more common now for women to ask men out, there’s still the expectation for guys to be the forward one. 

It’s not hopeless. I haven’t found my happy ever after but I’ve had my share of happy right nows. I’m not even sure if I’d want a LTR or marriage again. But there are a lot of success stories out there. 

I think you’ll find a lot of support here. Even though I don’t really think about cures, vaccines, treatments, I have enjoyed the community. Gives you a bit of reassurance that you’re not alone in this, you’re not the only one angry, sad, frustrated, grieving. That means a lot to me anyway."

I can understand the dads resistance, but I would have looked at it as having a living part of her with me forever."
greysanatomy,fqkt0kv,t3_gjf7jh,1589435447.0,"I totally missed that. I need to watch Ally McBeal again. I can’t think of Tom as anyone but Fish, & Stark as Biscuit.

Edit: watching some YouTube clips, I forgot Ty Diggs & Robert Downey Jr were in it!"
greysanatomy,fqksuzx,t3_gjfqi4,1589435326.0,"People have mentioned before that residents don’t make all that much. Even Callie, as an attending, was struggling after her dad cut her off. She should have been very well off, if she had been saving her salary and living off daddy. 

But Alex supposedly did the buy in with Dr. Butthole. On the other hand, I thought they paid off his student loans. They never really addressed Izzie’s medical debt... maybe that was assigned to her in the divorce. 

Divorce seems super easy in Seattle. All you have to say is I’m divorced or it’s final apparently. 

Not an answer but just musing along with you."
greysanatomy,fqks9x7,t3_gj612a,1589434863.0,"Someone said it a while back... Meredith is just phoning it in. I don’t think Mer even likes Mer anymore. She’s peaked, it’s time to wrap it up. I can’t even think of anyone worthy of a spin-off. Except Teddy, but then we’d have to have Owen. Now if we could get Teddy to go take Ross’s place in Switzerland with Cristina, that might be ok."

I love early Bailey... her lessons, outlook on life. My absolute favorite Bailey moment is when she talks to Callie about marriage. And Africa 😂"

I just realized Gasoline is the meth head that kills her husband in Breaking Bad. Skank, skank, skank... smash."
greysanatomy,fqkq2f1,t3_gjad8j,1589433181.0,"I just reached this point in my rewatch. It’s really pretty amazing, George’s transformation between retaking & passing his intern test to that final scene in the recruitment office. 

One thing that irritates me about his death is the debate over organ donation. Several times, he has been the person to convince the surviving family to allow donation. And it’s not the company line, you can tell he is genuinely pro-donation. He has a Choose Life magnet/bumper sticker on his locker. I know it was more dramatic and heart wrenching the way they went about it. 

It would have been interesting to see how he would have handled the future DCD case, >!The med student with Lou Gehrig’s disease. April did a wonderful job once she got on board though !<"
medical_advice,fqkpbox,t1_fqkogji,1589432641.0,"You definitely need to see a neurologist, IMO. I’d check into the tele-monitoring another person mentioned. Since they are random with no identifiable triggers, it would probably be impossible to induce in a clinic setting."

When you get around to dusting off your ceiling fan blades, do it before you do your sheets. Use a pillowcase to collect the dust. Just slip the case over the blade, then draw it outwards. Boom, dust is contained. That is my favorite cleaning hack, besides the squeegee."

Also, since he has a concealed carry permit, he might have had evasive training, like not standing in an open space with active gunfire. He may have taken his shots then retreated behind a wall."
