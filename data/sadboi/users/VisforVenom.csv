The app uses ""media volume"" instead of notification volume. So if your media output is silenced or low or routed via bluetooth or jack to something else that might be why you're not hearing the sound.

Meanwhile those listening to music off their phone are getting interrupted with a stupidly programmed media ping that goes off several times and also spam texts causing you to be immediately annoyed and raising stress level any time an offer comes in."

I will say, it's not all that important. I have severe full body terrible persistent psoriasis. Guttate (which always turns into plaque), plaque and inverse. All my clothes and bedding are bloodstained. I get uncomfortable anywhere but my room because I'm shedding dead skin everywhere. It's only gotten consistently worse over the last couple years. (Worth noting I'm also fat and bald and not particularly attractive and kind of annoying.)

In that time I've dated several girls and went through a bit of a ""sleeping around"" depression phase. As embarrassed and nervous and stressed as I am about it, no one else has ever cared. It doesn't make it *that* much better... Because the reality is *I'M* uncomfortable and that hinders enjoyment of sexual relationships all on its own.

Female bartender (who also can't make a drink to save her life) shows up for an opening shift completely trashed, 64 oz margarita in hand, starts dancing and stripping and almost falling off the bar. Takes hours to get removed from the building... Meh, no big deal. She's just a free spirit. 

Male employee asks absentee boss if she knows how to do something on the system she was just flown out to a vacation resort for a week to be trained on, and then says ""nevermind I'll figure it out"" after several texts of her (obviously drunk) just guessing at stuff and asking unrelated questions because she has no clue how anything works... Well that's a formal write-up and a sit-down meeting about being respectful and professional.

Female employees burn through thousands of dollars of product drinking at work and giving out free drinks to customers they're going to sleep with? Good for getting regulars. Male employee asks if we should close early because we have 10 employees on the clock and haven't had a customer in 4 hours? That's a probationary threat of termination.

That's why you're being directed to claim in GA. Which you should do.

I've had a few times in my life where I could have really used some temporary assistance, this being one of them, but it's always been that the timeframe they're using either disqualifies me or for some reason wouldn't work out.

I tried to file after being fired from a job as the manager of a bar and restaurant... When the outside hire with 0 experience they chose to give my position to after I had been doing it without the associated salary for months showed up drunk and fired me for being the only male in the building because her boyfriend broke up with her...

But because of the timeframe my wages were calculated based on the time before I took the management position where my wages were tip based or commissioned (I started there as a chalkboard artist) so I didn't have enough income to qualify... Despite losing a $1400 a week job. Of course 2 months later they closed up and laid everyone off and they all got unemployment.

Now I just finished a very expensive move to Aurora that due to complications cost about 3x what I had planned for and drained my savings and the jobs I was about to start are now closed... I have to file for unemployment in a previous state where the last place I worked was owned and operated by a rich coke-head that uses mommy's money to play ""businessman"" so he can impress girls that never took me off the books and is impossible to reach so they think I'm still employed.

I've been begging the last couple years for anyone to write me a prescription but all I get is ""no insurance covers this stuff"" (a blatent lie) and offers for biologics that I don't want to take. I've even expressed that I'd just pay full price for the stuff. But no go. 

It worked like a charm though. I never had enough for full body (even when it was prescribed it was like 1/4 as much as I should have had) but any place I used it cleared right up. I have often used calciprotriene and betamethazone in cream or ointment form and had little to no result.

It was a chemical manufacturing plant and they had shut down their old office and moved it to a trailer next door. There was a huge empty parking lot in between that was not marked as private and had no business attached to it. Safe to assume it was theirs as it was the only parking lot and was between two of their buildings.

While I'm sitting in a little trailer alone for close to 2 hours waiting for someone to show up and take my application I decided to step outside and saw cars being towed in the now full parking lot. I ran over as he was just starting to hook up my car and he refused to stop (I didn't know yet that if you get in the car they can't legally tow you.) He offered to stop if I gave him $300 cash right now. I called their number and was met with a rude old woman who I could barely understand just calling me names and screaming.

Turns out there was a Bernie Sanders rally at the park, which was where all the cars had come from. After all the cars were towed it was just me and a disabled man and his caretaker in the parking lot. We finally got ahold of someone in charge at the plant and explained the situation and he said he would have them release our cars to us, but we had to make a nearly 2 hour trek with a quadriplegic guy in a wheelchair to the tow yard.

After releasing the disability van and being very apologetic, waiting for them to leave, the tow guy said ""you're not getting your car back"" and then pulled a gun and demanded I get off the property. Apparently I had offended his ""beautiful sister"" on the phone, or someone did and they assumed it was me. Called the cops but they never showed up. Eventually had to get my girlfriend to come down there (it was her car) and give a sob story about being an elementary school teacher and pay them an extortion fee.

It's fucking legalized auto theft.

Found the owner on facebook that evening and of course he was bragging about towing a bunch of ""retard hippy liberals cars"". And the rest of his feed was full of racist homophobic shit. Go figure.

Never got an interview at that chemical plant either. Most likely due to the whole ordeal bc I was being sent there by a friend of the hiring manager and it was a pretty shoe-in gig.

Also living in New Orleans there are tow companies that definitely just tow cars at random for no reason and there's nothing you can really do to fight it.

I mean I guess we could try going through your post history but even that isn't always a great representation of your irl interactions as most people have slightly separate internet personalities.

Could be any number of things. Maybe you're mildly autistic. Maybe your friends are overly sensitive or have difficulty with conversations. Maybe your sense of humor doesn't vibe with them. Maybe you're a cunt. We have no way of knowing without more detail. And even then we're only getting one side of the story.

If it helps, most people also think I'm an asshole. To the point where it's a defining character trait and I've reached a point in my life where I'm exhausted by trying to maintain this ""funny asshole"" character that does not represent me well at all. Even people who know the things I've done, and been through, and continue to do. The way I live my life. Which I suppose would be considered by some to be abnormally sacrificial and altruistic. Like a ""grumpy old man that donates all his money to charity"" trope or something. Even those people still refer to me as an asshole. And I think it's mostly because I am.

This had to have taken at least 5 minutes of turning my phone all around, crossing my eyes, closing one eye and defocussing the open eye while repeating ""to my brain"" (a weird concept) *this part is raised, this part is raised.*

Then I finally saw it but as soon as I turned my phone right side up again it went right back to being a depression and I had to go through the process again. I've got it now and can switch back and forth, but it's been a long time since I've had such a hard time with one of these.

Interestingly, despite being especially good with this kind of illusion most of the time, I have only once ever successfully done a ""magic eye"" image... And even then it wasn't fully realized, I was rather only able to discern the pattern. I've often wondered if it's because of my acute eyesight (I have a hypersensitivity thing and all of my senses are overdeveloped with eyesight possibly being above 20/10) that I'm unable to do them. Whatever the cause, it makes them frustrating. I always feel like Ethan Suplee in Mallrats.

Edit: And then after typing that comment I had to go through the process again... Faster now. Turn phone upside down, repeat the word water in my head with dominant eye closed and non-dominant eye defocussed (like crossing eyes but one is closed) and trying to see the texture in the water droplet as being magnified rather than a different texture. 

The contrast in the image processing definitely amplifies the illusion. Good job OP."

It also always contains ""Ask DNA"" the opening credits song from the cowboy bebop movie.

The rest is usually 80s and 90s pop heavy with a lot of upbeat bluesy stuff scattered in. Things that make me laugh but also soundtrack walking through the city on a nice summer day well. Higher Love by Steve Winwood is a staple. Always followed by Let My Love Open the Door by Pete Townshend. Presidents of the USA, The Toadies, Sugar Ray. The whole Bat Out Hell album by Meatloaf. Third Eye Blind. Damon Albarn. Stuff that I associate with gradeschool summer breaks (I'm in my early 30s, but my father was a relatively successful drummer in the 70s and 80s so I grew up around rockstars of that era. Personal context definitely applies to these concepts.)

It's always at the top of my list when suggesting what to do for people suffering from depression. Make a happy, poppy playlist that is goofy and beat and makes you want to move. Avoid at all costs the temptation to lay in bed all day listening to Cigarettes After Sex, Nine Inch Nails and Daughter.

*Edit: ofcourse depressed people never listen. And giving someone a ""mixtape"" is harder to do in a meaningful way in this age. But it seriously is a phenomenally powerful step. As a veteran of suicidal depression I'd say it's the most important tool.*

For ""getting shit done"" that playlist can work as well. But I generally turn towards psytrance to get me motivated to do shit I don't want to do."
Denver,fhjf6ae,t1_fhhywkr,1581644685.0,"I once worked for 5 minutes at a waffle house. After watching the training tapes and getting into uniform on my first day, I walked out of the back to find the owner was in the store. He immediately pointed at me at and asked the manager ""what the hell is that?"" The manager introduced me as a new hire and I was immediately told by the owner that I'd have to shave. IRC he even instructed me to go to the convenience store next door and buy a razor. His tone and my notoriously bad temper as a younger man were already not mixing, but I had a baby on the way and needed a second job badly so I was trying to keep it civil.

I tried to start a conversation where I could explain that when I shave I break out badly and it's unsightly and painful. Mind you I had a short, neat, close beard. Just not all the way shaved. I couldn't even get to it because he just shouted ""that's our policy! You're working around food! It's disgusting!"" So I directed his attention to the grill cook that was presently working on an order with no gloves and a long scraggly beard. 

He replied, exact words: ""blacks cant shave because their skin is too oily and they break out.""

Y- bu- wait... I couldn't form the thoughts to tackle everything wrong with that and just went ""to the store"" and never came back. Ended up going to get a job at the gas station in my waffle house uniform lol.

Funniest bit is that it would later turn out that I have a combination of skin and autoimmune issues which introduce risks that could cause me to be hospitalized or even die from shaving. It's not likely, but it's an unnecessary risk because some racist old fuck thinks you gotta have a baby face to live like Jesus.

All my life I've faced that shaving issue. And you'd be amazed how many times it's in a store full of people with beards that they're allowed to keep due to religious beliefs or race. Which, fine, but also that means that it's obviously not an actual issue."

news,fhgw30a,t1_fhftx4y,1581581724.0,"Being a good cop in Louisiana (especially St Slammany, and doubly-so for troopers) goes hand in hand with being a piece of shit pedo.

You have to keep in mind that at least twice the FBI has had to fire entire police forces here, and train their replacements.

Also where you can count on a 5 to 12 hour response time from calling in about a robbery in progress, shots fired, or being trapped inside a building with a drunk lunatic outside trying to break the door in... Even when there's an officer parked 2 blocks away doing nothing. Partially because the police unions voted to block gps trackers in squad cars because it's a ""violation of privacy"" for dispatchers to be able to see where they are while on the clock in publicly owned vehicles.

Also where it was a widely known and accepted thing when I was a kid that you never pull over for a cop after dark or anywhere without witnesses. Because the likelihood of being robbed and beaten, arrested or killed was too high. Not that bad now, they mostly just don't do anything now after a handful of federal spankings.

The state that places sheriffs as the ""highest office"" in law enforcement and allows them to abuse their power to absurd extents in and out of their jurisdiction.

The state that spends millions in court over hospital bills and prisoners being tortured, humiliated, and brutally beaten.

Nola may be a little more cautious these days (politely and cooperatively pulling a little ""i know my rights"" schtick and knowing the loopholes goes a long way as long you're local.) But I doubt the rest of the state cares about that. All eyes off them from their perspective. St Tammany is notoriously corrupt and most people that live anywhere near it will tell you to avoid even passing through at all costs."
