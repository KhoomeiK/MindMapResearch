PublicFreakout,fqy6i6o,t1_fqxe8g8,1589743416.0,"Well. Kind of. Yes and no. If you can afford it? Why not? It is cheaper than the other options and with the Occulus Link you can play a lot more games. I think that is what definitely makes it more worth it. The ability to play a lot more games using the Occulus Link.

My issue is lack of forethought (literal story of my life). I have the room to play without the link. But, in my office, where my computer is... There isn't shit for free space to use the Quest with the Link. So that is really frustrating on my end. Like maybe a 4x4 space. Doable my guess but not much to work with. 


I haven't bought the Link yet. I'm sure I will. Also the other thing to take into consideration is the cost of the games. I'm talking only the games that have good ratings and interest you. Maybe go through and add up what it would cost you at first with everything including five or six games. 


I have crazy bad ADD so I need multiple games to hop back and forth between. 


Most any of the games that seem to be worth the buy are like $15-$40 each. 

I still think it'd be worth it. I've waited my whole life for VR. I'm 37. So it is very exciting to me and honestly have been burning lots of calories according to my fitbit.

But if you can't afford the Link and a handful of games to start out... Probably not."

IAmA,fqmgz12,t3_gjosrb,1589477286.0,"I've never asked anything in one of these before ... But I have sleep apnea.  The neurologist where I am claimed obstructive (I had gained almost 100 lbs) and central. 

From what I've read, central is caused by heart failure, stroke, etc. So without those, could I have central? 

Also, my CPAP for sure helped at first. I had energy again!! I have lost about 60 lbs. So I'm assuming the obstructive is probably not as bad but I feel so so tired again. Can't find energy to push myself anymore (like before my first sleep study). I had read that CPAP doesn't really help central sleep apnea.  Could that be the issue now? Should I get another sleep study now that I weigh so much less?

Any thoughts on why I would be so so so tired again? I use my CPAP every night. I clean it as required every day.  I'm at a loss. And I'm so tired of being tired. I sleep pretty OK through the night, I think (and according to my Fitbit). About 7.5-8.5 hrs. 

Thanks for any advice or guidance. Part of me wonders how much my specific doctor really understands sleep apnea since he didn't have any specific instructions or advice for the central apnea, even after I went back after losing so much weight. 

How do I find a good sleep specialist? Sorry. Last question!"
