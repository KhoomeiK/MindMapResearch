modernwarfare,fpiol0m,t3_gdp2yb,1588645279.0,"While I don't use LMG's much in multiplayer I main the PKM in warzone. Different Lmg's choices depend on your preference though. I use Lmg's especially in trios because there isn't much point to having three snipers on your team. Additionally, they have the fastest TTK apart from one shot weapons after 60 meters. They are ok for countering snipers but usually I leave that up to the other guys on my team sniping. It easily outguns any other gun including the m4 or the grau from 30 meters onwards and do wonders against all vehicles. When paired with an SMG, just to cover close range they are super effective."
ketamine,foxp9qw,t3_ga61lb,1588151466.0,"Best advice would be to ease yourself into it. Doing small bumps and measuring it. Especially if you haven't done ket before reaching the point of a k-hole can just numb out and dissociate on individual while another person could vomit or another might have a seizure. I have seen all 3 and while I love ket and recommend it over alot of drugs, like any substance it is stupid and probs a waste of money to just dive into it."

AnorexiaRecovery,f7k588t,t3_dwc38q,1573795059.0,"So typically anorexia in general is viewed us ""body image"" or achieving the ideal body type. When this is applied to men it usually isnt about chasing the typical ideal of a shredded, strong body builder type in those with anorexia. While disordered eating may occur in those who seek this body type is not all that common in men who have anorexia."
eating_disorders,f7k152o,t3_dwhzip,1573791803.0,Ive been reasonably skinny all my life and commonly called anorexic even when I was happy. Kinda funny I did actually develop anorexia when I got older.
