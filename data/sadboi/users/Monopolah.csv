When your boyfriend calls you crazy for thinking that he's hard for other women on social media, he is completely disregarding the fact that he already did this before. He is not empathetic about the fact that he did that to hurt you in the past. 

Also, I don't think you should be dating someone if you are accusing them of doing things. Either break up with him, or accept that he masturbated to your friend and isn't sorry about it. I know he's not sorry about it because he calls you crazy for thinking that he'a doing it again. That's not crazy, it's called rational fear of past behaviors that might reoccur. But, like I said, I don't think you should dating someone if you think they are doing things that you dislike.
