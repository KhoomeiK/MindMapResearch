Mother, O Mother, come shake out your cloth,
Empty the dustpan, poison the moth,
Hang out the washing, make up the bed,
Sew on a button and butter the bread.

Where is the mother whose house is so shocking?
She’s up in the nursery, blissfully rocking.

Oh, I’ve grown as shiftless as Little Boy Blue,
Lullabye, rockabye, lullabye loo.
Dishes are waiting and bills are past due
Pat-a-cake, darling, and peek, peekaboo

The shopping’s not done and there’s nothing for stew
And out in the yard there’s a hullabaloo
But I’m playing Kanga and this is my Roo
Look! Aren’t his eyes the most wonderful hue?
Lullabye, rockaby lullabye loo.

The cleaning and scrubbing can wait till tomorrow
But children grow up as I’ve learned to my sorrow.
So quiet down cobwebs; Dust go to sleep!
I’m rocking my baby and babies don’t keep.

I'm an adult and I go every week now even though I often talk about just literally the events of my week. Other things pop up and sometimes I go in with really specific things to talk about. 

This all to say, meds might not come quickly and in many cases you can get in with a counselor before a psych. Meds are almost always more effective if used in combination with other therapies (talk therapy, Cognitive behavioral therapy, etc). You didn't say why you rejected counseling and I know a bad counselor can definitely do harm.  It can be hard but you went with a list of things you wanted to say - that makes me think that you may benefit from finding a good fit and you're so young that it is worth a shot. It's hard work and you are worth it."

Which is great if you're in the US. If not, I hope there's another resource like this one you can use. All the best to you as you move through this, and discover who you are as an individual. There will be joy there on the other side!"
