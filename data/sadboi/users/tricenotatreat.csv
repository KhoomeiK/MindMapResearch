SuicideWatch,fqfrpgb,t3_gio4i5,1589330388.0,Same but it’s probably because I’m bipolar and no one wants to be my friend
BipolarReddit,fqfhkbn,t3_gild96,1589325013.0,It’s up to you to share they may try to stop your management of it. But hey you’ve been trying to talk to them what is more time going to do for that.??? More talking about what the signs are fucking clear I need meds and the people in my life are gonna be happy I’m taking care of myself. End of story.
BipolarReddit,fqfhcqu,t3_gild96,1589324903.0,Yes I have gone thru this. Recently diagnosed 2 years ago. I’m 29 and have pretty much realized my family doesn’t like that I need meds to be functional. They took me for testing as a child but didn’t take heed to it. 2 suicide attempts later and I pretty much hate them for not listening to the dr when I was kid. Felt I would’ve had a better outcome. Oh and now after 2 years my dad finally made mention about me taking medicine. Fuck off dad. Don’t want your help anymore. After going thru various jobs not being able to be stable going to drs & not feeling supported those two years I just really said fuck it idc. I thought I was gonna kill myself this time but I didn’t. Glad you took matters into your own hands at a younger age. Wish I had done the same.
SuicideWatch,fqf13fu,t3_gifr76,1589316950.0,Fucking this bro!!!!! Sometimes I feel like ok since I’m bipolar what jobs will help me stay at work. The answer is damn near none unless I get to work alone!!!! I’m hoping to find a job where I get to be alone soon so I can work cuz otherwise imma start feeling crappy again
icecream,fqexeez,t3_giiy4s,1589315174.0,& this is at Kroger right??? Never even heard of it omg imma have to try
BipolarReddit,fqes2mk,t3_gifoy4,1589312661.0,Yay!!!! Glad you found someone who paid attention to help you find out what was going on!!!! You’re stronger than you think & have dealt with this for so long you deserve relief

BipolarReddit,fqa6ubi,t3_ghjdk9,1589213854.0,This post made me feel so seen I could cry.
BipolarReddit,fq890be,t3_ghcqre,1589160942.0,I have this!!! I’m bipolar1 and don’t typically have big mood swings until 10-12 days before my period. Yeap this bitch pretty much only gets one week to feel “myself”. When my cycle isn’t on I’m just relieved it’s over then I spend a week doing ok general mood swings but I manage it(no meds right now). I can’t even believe I’m not always on a rampage but I have just resorted to staying in the house unless at work. I can’t take it anymore. I’m not afraid to act out in public & the public stares piss me off even more. Hope we all get some relief soon

SuicideWatch,foikxw9,t1_foikk21,1587789277.0,It’s sad that it’s the one thing I don’t wanna care about. I see how negativey it affects me. Forcing myself to care about money only reminded me I’m in a game of sorts. We deserve justice too
SuicideWatch,foi6kao,t1_foi6c65,1587779767.0,"I ask this question myself. I used to feel kinda jealous of those kids who were bad as hell at school but they always had nice trendy clothes.

I just hope I remind myself everyday that there are things I want that no one can take away from me that makes everyday I go through , good or bad, worth it."
SuicideWatch,foi62uv,t3_g7kzys,1587779473.0,You didn’t do anything. Life just seems like a fucked up simulation. Idk what an American dream is. Everything seems so pointless

NoStupidQuestions,fohdyxg,t1_fohdmct,1587764352.0,You’re right. It’s like that with myself I’m 29 don’t really hang out with people just work and home. All you gotta do is keep your room clean and do your laundry. Anything to give him one less thing to worry about really. He’s complaining because sometimes we hate how our jobs are because of other people.
NoStupidQuestions,fohci5b,t3_g7g3kw,1587763664.0,He is struggling to keep up in life right now but is trying. We all end up seeing how being an adult is nothing but a big ass simulation and no one really knows what they’re doing

venting,foc3jiv,t1_fobuoxz,1587666701.0,Sis I went to a job interview today. I got a detox drink and tried to just be happy. Then I went and cried cuz it’s my birthday & the Lyft driver was being stupid. I’m like goodness don’t let my birthday start off terrible. I get to the interview and fill all the paperwork now I was worried for because of the drug test I knew I had a 50/50 chance of passing. Girl I passed the test. I just had to tell myself to stop worrying. Today I turned 29 and I almost killed my self. I’m gonna say this shit hard as hell. I felt like I was hanging on by my pinky. I cried everyday. I literally was gonna but sleeping pills yesterday & just end it but I thought hey it’s your birthday give it one more try and put your all in it. GOD saved me from myself. For my birthday. I needed that. I’m hoping that I can maintain this job. I really do. I have learned to let go of things but not fully. Today I promise myself to learn to let go of things completely so I can learn to live & not let the negatives of my life take over me. I don’t deserve a sad life I deserve a happy on and GOD will do that for me if I just let go of the negative & understand it’s there to help me grow. Hope this helps ❤️
SuicideWatch,foabkdv,t1_foa53fi,1587643798.0,Yes idk what could possibly distract for that long. I like sitting in silence even when I’m happy so it’s like I can’t just try to always distract myself. We’re trying that’s all I can do I guess
SuicideWatch,foabe9d,t1_fo9kqvk,1587643698.0,Oh I couldn’t get a detox drink so I got bout a 50/50 chance to pass. I’m just going to the interview because all I gotta do is have a little faith & it’ll work out. That’s what I’m hoping. I did go to Walmart to look for a detox drink I saw the sleeping pills but I told myself I wasn’t here for those yet. A few more hours till the interview
SuicideWatch,fo90kxg,t3_g6dfe5,1587607847.0,How can I focus on anything when my mind is consumed with pain...when will it stop?? I’ve tried brushing it off that doesn’t work anymore
SuicideWatch,fo8y28b,t3_g6dobt,1587606269.0,I’m playing shaed trampoline trying to keep my mind distracted I know what op is going thru. I’m trying to be positive. Hey kid it’s hard but try with me ok
SuicideWatch,fo8w1z8,t1_fo820ak,1587605039.0,"Jokes on you man ain’t no detox drink for me. It figures. Kinda mad but hey it’s a chance to test my faith in God. Like look Man U see me down here struggling just help a sista out. Shit I’m on my last nerve, I’m hanging off the cliff like mufasa on lion king. I got a 50/50 chance of passing the test. Idk what I’ll do if it doesn’t work.shit it’ll be my birthday tomorrow guess I’ll just try to score a free meal before I try to off myself"

SuicideWatch,fo861d9,t1_fo85fak,1587590534.0,Because I’m not capable of surviving. Nothing will get better for me. Tomorrow is my birthday but I still wanna kill myself. But I have a little hope. I got an interview for a job but it’s dependent on my passing a drug test I have been smoking so imma get a detox drink just to say I’ve tried everything & not feel bad when I kill myself if I don’t get the job
SuicideWatch,fo85lz0,t1_fo85ejp,1587590315.0,I’ve been in one too. Don’t recommend it either but at least I’m not “dead” & all the people that “care so much” will be able to “see” me.
SuicideWatch,fo858b0,t1_fo6z0e1,1587590118.0,So what you just keep laughing at yourself every year saying “wow I was so stupid look at all the dumb shit that happened to me”... yea that sounds very appealing I might just hang in there for the fuck of it. Who knows I might actually get to die in said dumb shit that happened to me.
SuicideWatch,fo848ai,t3_g67z4e,1587589613.0,Bro wtf am I waiting for if someone had told me I’d be a fuck up of an adult I would’ve believed them. I should’ve known my life was gonna suck soon as my mom died. I’m glad you got to see God though I’d much rather him just send me to hell cuz it’s what I deserve I can’t do anything right. I can’t even survive
SuicideWatch,fo801o5,t1_fo7xrro,1587587502.0,I was talking about taking the pills & just enjoying the last time I had before it killed me. I have wine I just don’t have pills. I’m going to go on a job interview tomorrow I’m hoping to be hired however it’s dependent upon if I pass the drug test. I’m going to make sure I get a detox drink because I have been smoking (out of a job & place) & im trying to give myself the best chance for the interview. Otherwise I’ll be looking at those pills. It’s my birthday tomorrow so for me it’s like the job interview is a present to myself so I want to do well on it. We’ll see tomorrow I guess. Thanks for listening
SuicideWatch,fo7xhwm,t1_fo5u9e9,1587586233.0,This is what I’m afraid of but I mean being institutionalized is like being dead no one knows you’re there sounds like a good option
SuicideWatch,fo7whd8,t1_fo6xrk9,1587585730.0,This is what I’m going to do
dating_advice,fo2pi3z,t3_g5dejh,1587470608.0,Honestly just remember your username is pretty much how he acted about the situation that should give you a clue on how serious you’d take it. He knows it would hurt cuz u didn’t even wanna talk to him about your surgery. If there’s a next time for a surgery I bet he won’t make the same mistake. That’s if he really cares about you and sees a future with you which he probably does because he ain’t tryna walk away after being insensitive like that. It’s like he doesn’t realize those scars aren’t something he had to mention to her everybody doesn’t need to know the details. He has to learn to be more private about what he shares about his relationship
SuicideWatch,fo0wszy,t1_fo0wp1t,1587421250.0,No problem. I don’t feel too upset but I’m just hopeful is all I can be

AskReddit,fnz0ysq,t3_g4qju7,1587382795.0,It was kinda terrible. Depending on if you got to stay at a shelter or not. Really the state you live in determines how well your life was while being homeless. I did a lot of walking during that tome. I’m so used to walking idk how I’ll feel when I get a car again. That’s if life lets me start over and build something. Cuz otherwise I’m basically about to end up homeless again
SuicideWatch,fnz0jco,t1_fny9hyh,1587382398.0,I was at the hospital waiting to go to the psych ward I wasn’t able to go until I did a telehealth call with the dr at the psych ward

teenagers,fny5g11,t3_g49e39,1587353864.0,"There is such thing as a delayed reaction I hope you know that. Everyone grieves differently and certainly reacts to it firsthand differently. I didn’t cry when my mom died. I didn’t cry at the wake nor the funeral idk when I actually cried about it. Probably by myself. I was 13 I didn’t want to cry around anyone. But what I’m saying is, sometimes you’re not gonna react the way u think u should and that’s ok."

AskReddit,fnxzizg,t1_fnxu28v,1587349827.0,Best answer I’ve seen on reddit is it ok if I post this answer in the suicide watch sub?? I can’t cross post but I really feel like someone might see it & it might help. It helped give me some confidence and look at myself a lil different. Anywho thanks for your thoughtful answer.
SuicideWatch,fnxxvou,t1_fnxxb7u,1587348729.0,True. Damn What do you think you’ll end up doing?? I know we want to die but I’m trying not to go straight to homelessness. But I just feel like wtf I’m all out of moves here. I hate where I’m living so I feel like I need to move out of state but during this time it’s probably just as well suicide to do that. I’m going to see whether I can get a job soon to decide if that’s what I’m going to do
SuicideWatch,fnxufmv,t3_g4jch5,1587346566.0,I’ve been feeling I can’t find myself anymore. I’m 28 & I walk around earth like well why is this xyz or what is the point of abc. When I turned 18 I thought I was gonna be able to go out into the world and try my hardest. These last ten years have beat me up. Idk if my start button works anymore. I don’t see any reason why I’m alive cuz nothing interests me because I always been tryna prove I can be something. Thank you for this accurate post. It reminds me how I’m not alone wondering what life’s all about
AskReddit,fnxray0,t3_g4ixir,1587344714.0,I think it’s about the equivalent to three times a week
SuicideWatch,fnxkc16,t1_fnxjk46,1587340430.0,I still think I’m a burden to people girl that’s why I don’t ever talk to people but I try to realize it’s nothing I can do if I am being a burden though cuz the person said I could ask them for help. But I’m so hard on myself I won’t ask for shit from anybody
SuicideWatch,fnxjtrf,t1_fnxjcxl,1587340129.0,Idk what normal is I have learned to suppress my urges to do shit but my episodes are bad so I’ve tried to just stay away from people as much as I can. But I’ve learned to go out & have fun by myself. Like I was trying to force myself to be better even if I’m all alone. You’re a person that can change & will change.
SuicideWatch,fnxiap1,t1_fnxhj4q,1587339210.0,Right that was a shit move on them because we won’t learn how to effectively mend our relationships if people don’t give us the chance. Now you tried three times. They clearly don’t care if you’ve gotten better. But I’m glad you’ve gotten better shit u even managed to get disposable income. They’re gonna learn to accept people wanting closure sooner than later. It’s like they think you’re toxic when you’re not you’re just a decent person who has mental abilities that focus on stuff we don’t need.
SuicideWatch,fnxhxe3,t1_fnxh8n5,1587338988.0,Did u comment on one of my post someone else told me they were ocd... hi fellow bipolar person!!!! I have bipolar as well. Why do you think you’re difficult I’ll be damned if I look at myself that way. We always blame ourselves that’s our defense mechanism. I still feel like it’s my fault I don’t have a job nor place to stay. But I know it’s not my fault. It is shitty. I have gotten rid of all those people that hurt me but I’m not able to make friends easily since I fear if someone knows I’m bipolar I’ll get talked about or looked at like a freak (as if I ain’t ugly enough). I hope I learn to just think about myself from here on out
SuicideWatch,fnxgp6a,t3_g4gqka,1587338262.0,Do you want closure from the situation or from everything in general??
SuicideWatch,fnxgn3e,t3_g4gqka,1587338227.0,It’s fucking stupid that people push u right where u shouldn’t be. I mean if u know I’m not around my parent why tf would u do something to make me end up there. Those feelings of abandonment hurt like hell. It’s just I’m so sick of how people are treating us. It’s just like ok you don’t have to keep hurting me ya know
SuicideWatch,fnxg7t8,t3_g4gqka,1587337974.0,You know what I hate?? They tell u to go to the hospital but don’t seem to understand there’s a need for at home support.

SuicideWatch,fnxa77h,t1_fnx9t2q,1587334544.0,I was homeless because I was in a relationship with a guy who was basically telling me what to do. A bunch of bad decisions. Feeling like I could try with him again I went back to where he lived but only ended up being homeless since he didn’t actually want me. I move to Tennessee afterwards to try to get a better bond with my sisters & just start my life over. That was 4 years ago when I came here & I’ve just been dealing with not being able to keep a job because I quit cuz something triggered me or harassment or I felt I was suffering with the job I was doing. Nothing really felt normal I just kept trying to get back up after I’d fall. I’m just tired now of trying to start my life over.
SuicideWatch,fnx9jqr,t3_g4fc8x,1587334173.0,Yes I’ve had to go to the hospital as well for a suicide watch. I did attempt at the hospital so I was stuck for a few days. I hate going but I feel like I should go back. I’m clearly not making any progress in life right now
SuicideWatch,fnx93s8,t1_fnx8kre,1587333921.0,The sister she was telling about lives farther sway &cannot help me as she’s just started a job & can’t take time like that to be out. Their dad lives in California we’re all in Tennessee in the US. I don’t think you read the link because it states their mom is dead and that’s the only one I’ve known as a mother. I might can get a job but we’ll see I’ve been applying to jobs I just haven’t heard anything. I’m suffering from not being able to work because I’m also low on funds so I have to make my moves calculated.
SuicideWatch,fnx8lts,t1_fnx865x,1587333637.0,Then I saw on someone post that luck is preparing for opportunity and I’m like wtf???? That’s not how we call people lucky though. Like I used to get upset in high school because the worst kids always had the nicest stuff. I hated feeling like I had to hold on to stuff & always acted as if I never needed nice things. Now I’m almost 30 & hardly have bought myself anything nice I’ve been just doing the bare minimum to keep myself thinking I’m happy
SuicideWatch,fnx7pfc,t3_g4g2w7,1587333120.0,Fuck that therapist. Wish we could get their license revoked. This is what I mean by people going thru shit & can’t even get out of it. I promise being homeless sucks but even I’d do that right now if I were in your situation. I’ve also been homeless before if that helps
SuicideWatch,fnx6fn3,t1_fnx5px1,1587332400.0,"My sister asked me why I asked her for help & to ask her dad or sister. I only asked her stupid ass because she’s was 5 mins away from me and could help. Oh well that’s fine it’s all fine. I haven’t taken meds since January I have bad flip outs when something triggers me & something triggered me at the last clinic visit so I haven’t gone back. All my friends have no room or are across the states. That last job fired me because I wasn’t talkative enough & so I didn’t have the right attitude to work there. Thats just as well I mean fuck you’d rather have a bipolar girl throwin a fuckin fit I get it it’s funny to watch.


But here’s your story of a life time hun


https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g1ae0t/here_goes_nothing/fnf03yq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

I was homeless because I was letting a guy take care of me he asked me to do something stupid and I lost my job & ended up homeless. Then a second time I thought I was going to go be with him again ended up homeless again"
SuicideWatch,fnx4e0l,t1_fnx41me,1587331249.0,"All you can do is try. I have contemplated cutting a lot but I keep snapping myself out of it and just crying some more.  Yea I’m a bipolar fucktard who can’t keep a job. So right before quarantine I lost my job and apartment on the same day. I don’t have a car so I’ve just been spending all my money for food n a place to stay. We’ll see maybe the homeless life was meant for me I mean after all, I have been homeless twice why not just go back to it clearly I can’t keep my life together."

AskReddit,fnw07ph,t1_fnvzqrc,1587308734.0,First I gotta find out who is my family. I’ll be sure to put a pin in this. For now I’m just orphan Annie & don’t get to go to mr warbucks.

AskReddit,fnvzdh1,t3_g48fqg,1587308227.0,"My stepsister. This is the first time I’ve called her that but honestly it fits. I’m adopted the rest of my sisters are the parents biological kids. I was born first and picked out from the hospital before any of them came along. Thought it was understood that I’m family regardless. Once the oldest (I’m the oldest child but she’s the second oldest) of the 3 found out I was adopted she started treating me a little different when we were kids. Fast forward now we’re all in our late 20s & I don’t talk to any of them especially her. A month ago I lost my job and my apartment on the same day. I called her to see if I could crash where she was because she is the closest to me in this state& can help. 

Me: hey etc yea I don’t have a job or a place to stay
stepsister: idk why you called me I can’t help you why don’t you call ____ or dad
Me: that’s true
Stepsister: yea don’t doubt yourself on asking for help
Me: yea ok I’m gonna go now *hangs up phone and proceeds to block her and the other sisters number*

I am an idiot for calling because I know she doesn’t care for me much unless I can do something for her. I was desperate as I have been freaking out because it’s a pandemic, minimal people were ok and didn’t freak out but I was not one of them. She was 5 minutes away from where I was staying. The sister she was asking me to ask lives in a city 45 mins away & is not able to help me because of her schedule and I knew that. Their dad is back home in fucking California what exactly can he do go broke trying to give me money??? That’s not exactly smart. Anywho I hate her. People always think I’m stupid not asking for help but honestly I’m just used to responses like hers from other immediate family. I was pretty correct to assume the world would act the same way."
dating_advice,fnvxvxx,t3_g47ovk,1587307301.0,Know that you can always work on being on the phone with him. It’s hard for all of us I used to have anxiety calling places but I got better. Y’all are only 15 it’s not much y’all can do besides try to have fun but maybe y’all just have been bored with your current hobbies together and should make new ones. That’s a start
AskReddit,fnvvy41,t1_fnvr691,1587306042.0,This is already happening. Next

SuicideWatch,fnubapm,t1_fnua6b7,1587258401.0,Like I’m 28 I’ll be 29 in a few days I feel so sad cuz it’s like I wished I could talk to friends that didn’t mind me being sad. Like I blocked them because I didn’t want to seem like the depressed bipolar friend. I’ve started over so much idk what to do anymore. Of course I’ll talk to ya more often on here from now on. I’ve deleted all my social media & honestly since I’ve come on here I’ve even liked it more than twitter. I might still get my twitter back but probably not my Instagram.
SuicideWatch,fnu9pnv,t3_g3uuyy,1587257447.0,You’re hurting because of stuff he did he knows you’re sad but doesn’t care. Sounds like me. We just gotta get new friends but hell it was hard enough getting the ones I had. I just broke up with my ex he wants to remain friends. Idk if I’ll ever date again. I’m tired of trying all the time. I feel like my start button is broken
NatureIsFuckingLit,fnu5fxw,t3_g3vdkt,1587254915.0,Me if I was a retarded doe
SuicideWatch,fnu5c6o,t3_g3t3m8,1587254855.0,I feel like this all the time now. It hurts like sometimes I always wonder why do I even get happy about stuff it doesn’t really last long anyway. I’m trying to feel motivated about starting all over again but I really don’t see the point anymore
