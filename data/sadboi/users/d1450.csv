No , it's not a joke. I'm not going to tell you how many years I've cruised/cycled for because looking at your attitude you're going to take it as a brag or some other nonsense. I'm just stating it's suddenly to much for me. If you take personal offense to it, log off.

JoeRogan,fqos8f1,t3_gjvg4h,1589523324.0,"So this really bugs me about a lot of online podcast/interviewer fans:

Joe knows way more about what happens behind the scenes in regards to government... Hollywood... policy making... Friends at that level have the kind of access to information you will most likely never, ever have in your entire life. I would say on any given topic, 3/4 of us have no fucking clue what's really happening. 

And yet - people are *so* sure they have a better grasp of issues. We are small time cattle. Keep your aggressive opinions on the back burner and stop trying to convince others. 
For example you might have an airtight understanding of economic concepts, but you don't have access to key facts that are steering this country right now. Facts that are unverifiable for the common man. No matter how convinced you are that you know.

Absolutely not saying that Joe can't be ignorant by choice... I'm saying you're ignorant because you have no choice. Joe isn't subject to misinformation in the same way me and you are. There's quite a few people that have even a decent grasp of what's happening - you're probably not one of them.

On a tangent,

People that have actual faith in God love others like they love God. Religion revolves around doing God's will in a modern society (or any society). Just want you to know , that the idea of giving God all the credit, is just about realizing you can't control everything. If it doesn't work like that, it's not a religion, it's a cult and a scam.

Obviously it's not for anyone else to 'realize'... so nobody jump the gun and assume it is.
