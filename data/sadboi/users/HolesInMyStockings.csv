I'm the same, I could be in a great mood and someone could say something in a weird tone or something and I'll wonder what I did to get that tone from that person and it will total flip my mood and keep me up at night. I try to force myself to stay in a good mood or at least pretend so that people don't think I'm pathetic"

Make sure to block him on everything, his number and all social media so that he can't contact you, sometimes its extremely easy to be seduced by familiarity, and promises from someone manipulative who used to have so much power over you. He'll probably be desperate to win you back with false promises. 

Stay strong and good luck, may your 2020 be full of growth and success ‚ù§Ô∏è"

What you are feeling is valid, don't ever feel like you can't feel bad because other people may have it worse. You matter and your feelings matter.
Have you tried speaking to a professional by the way? It may help how you are feeling"

Thank you, People tell me to just not cry and to just calm down, it makes me feel bad because I just can't, so it's comforting to know that you understand.
You've definitely encouraged me to go see a psychiatrist so I'm going to do that as soon as I can.

My friends mom passed away and when she went to the pharmacy she broke down in front of the person behind the counter and he gave her the pills to calm down. She had a couple for the funeral and gave the rest of the pills to me. So I didn't get them myself but I know she didn't need a prescription to get it"
