india,fqovrdj,t1_fqouccp,1589526345.0,"Thats exactly what I was saying. When the person that I replied to said ""They are not allowed to act on their gay desires inside the mosques/churches"" well they arent allowed to act on their heterosexual desires either. thats what I meant. Inside churches/mosques you're only allowed to pray and not act on your sexual desires be it heterosexual desires or homosexual desires. The person I replied to made it seem like two gay men aren't allowed to kiss each other while a man and a woman are. Thats what I was trying to clear out."
india,fqomen0,t1_fqokz8v,1589518729.0,">But Being gay in Islam is still a taboo,  the usual argument is, ""as long as they don't act on their gay desires"" or something like that, it's not wrong.

I am pretty sure being straight in churches/mosques is also not allowed. You're not allowed to do heterosexual or homosexual things in churches/mosques. You're only allowed to pray.  


>But Being gay in Islam is still a taboo, the usual argument is, ""as long as they don't act on their gay desires"" or something like that, it's not wrong.

There's no one absolute version of any religion. Maybe there's a scriptual version of Islam that's homophobic but many Muslims and activists believe that Islam doesn't forbid homosexuality and if all the Muslims/christians start believeing that, that'd be a fucking Eutopia. I hope that happens and it's started in the west, hopefully would here as well. As long as we keep these fundamentalists and extremists in check, everything would be fine and world would be able to progress."
india,fqok3cd,t1_fqoc202,1589517093.0,">This is a very good point and i agree. But is it ok, if SC intervenes in religious traditions for example: Can the supreme court force Muslims to accept gay people or let gay people participate in Church What do you think about the temples that allow only women?. A lot of Amman temples have women only rituals. Should all temples/churches/mosques allow people of all religious faith to come inside their place?.

That'd be ideal but it isn't happening any time soon. Maybe some time in the future. There are gay Muslims who go to mosque and pray and gay christians who go to churches in western countries. Hopefully that'd happen here as well. I don't see a problem with that happening. It's absolutely what should happen

 and it is what we all look forward to."
