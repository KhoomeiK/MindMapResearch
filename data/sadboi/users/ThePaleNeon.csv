But apparently being ruled by a party that calls itself a communist party renders these material realities in how they function on a world stage, completely moot.

Let's just assume they're communist: why would that preclude a proper critique of the capitalist system? It says a lot about you that when one properly identifies the faults, contradictions, and damage that capitalism has brought upon the world; you immediately assume the proposed opposite, Soviet Russia and Authoritarian China, must have differing material realities that result in the same dysfunctions. When, in reality, the faults usually lie along the same structural issues for both 20th Century capitalist and  communist societies! Unjust hierarchies, unchecked power, and a severe lack of a democratized workforce. Where power still wields its hammer, and thus, decisions are made by those in power to keep their power.

I had recently gone through a severe bout of anxiety and insomnia that put me in a psychiatric hold. It wasn't a particularly terrifying affair: I had really only desired to get anti-anxiety meds and sleeping pills to get me over the slump, and I wasn't willing to wait for a doctor's appointment since my insomnia was so bad. The sleeping pills were standard, and they worked: however, they gave me an off-label use of an antipsychotic to treat my anxiety. I understood that they wanted to avoid giving me benzos due to their risk for addiction, so I was fine with it. I did not anticipate a particular side effect. 

Akathisia is a condition that isn't discussed often in the context of mental health treatments, as it can be a side effect of antidepressants, but mainly it occurs with antipsychotics. But it is, bar none, the worst experience I've ever had in my life. I would have not hesitated to put a bullet in my head if I was told it was permanent. 

The descriptions you'll find on the Internet do not do it justice. It isn't akin to an anxious restlessness that can be relieved with pacing, tapping your foot, or simply stopping to take a few breaths. It is a restlessness that feels imbedded in your very muscles and nerves, as if they are screaming at you for relief that they will never get. You do everything in your power to relieve it: you shake your body, pace back and forth, you feel as if your entire body is on the verge of exploding and relieve all of this tension. But it never comes. It's impossible. 

Most redditors are probably more familiar with 'restless leg syndrome', which is that urge to move your legs while trying to sleep. It's similar to akathisia, but imagine that urge occuring in the very core of your body and mind. You can't pinpoint where the feeling is coming from, but it's there, and it drives you fucking insane. 

I had it for two days. I couldn't sleep, couldn't shower, couldn't eat. All I did was pace around my house like an absolute freak until my legs were severely sore and I had given myself blisters. There is no conceivable word that accurately sums up the torture of feeling like every individual nerve in your body is screaming at your brain to never rest and relax. And nothing but stopping the antipsychotic would relieve it.

I think about it a lot. Now I know why mental hospital patients spend their time pacing so much."

We're dealing with a novel virus, with no vaccine and no herd immunity, that appears to be more infectious than the seasonal flu despite a relatively similar fatality rate (I can't provide links, but browse /r/COVID19 and you'll be able to triangulate that the fatality rate is rather low.) It's an empirical fact that this would overwhelm hospitals. Flattening the curve is important to save lives.

That being said, our reality and what we perceive as immediate danger doesn't exactly listen to pure facts or reason. Just how our monkey brains work. The media chooses what we fear. And the media, whether intentional or unintentional, has made COVID-19 seem like the apocalypse. I think it's because of a variety of circumstances: for one, we're all stuck at home so we have more time to sit down and consume this news.

The media knows that, too. There was clearly a cynical push to start airing rare cases of younger people ending up in the ICU, or dying. This most likely arose when the narrative that 'the elderly and immunocompromised are mainly at-risk' took on, which probably kept younger people, ome of the biggest demographics, from turning in and getting those article clicks.

Misinformation still spreads like wildfire in the age of information. Don't just take a single news headline or a single Reddit comment as gospel; investigate yourself, and use common sense.

And limit your time spent browsing the news. You don't need to sit there all day, reading about new cases on the other side of the Earth."
Anxiety,fkrqteh,t1_fkrpcsc,1584474195.0,"A repeat of the *exact* same conspiracy theories with HIV/AIDS. It wasn't true then, and it's not true now. First, ask yourself: what would be the incentive for creating a virus to wipe out the population? One might say 'curbing overpopulation' as a way to benefit the rich, but the world is shutting down and stock markets are crashing. This is of no benefit to the rich, they're losing money right now. 

The simplest, and correct answer: a single wet market in China, with unsanitary conditions, passed the virus from animals to humans. Most likely through pigs that were infected by bats."

Anxiety,fkhyodg,t3_eupik4,1584208453.0,"Here's a list of common symptoms arising from chronic anxiety/stress:

- chest pain

- difficulty breathing/shortness of breath

- muscular tension

- neck and shoulder pain

- tingling sensations

- migraines/tension headaches

- dizziness

- fatigue

And that's just a few of them. A LOT of the symptoms of anxiety/stress line up with reported symptoms of COVID-19: the only real missing factor is a fever and a cough. If you don't have a fever or a real, persistent cough, you definitely don't have COVID-19. Just take a deep breath, and remind yourself that it's most likely your chronic stress and anxiety. Try not to compulsively check your temperature: only do it once or twice a day. And practice good hygiene!"

Coronavirus,fkdmjs3,t1_fkdmexl,1584084958.0,"Uh, OK? I said that we spend the most on healthcare than any other country, but it's an inefficient and parasitic system because consumer markets exist with pharmaceutical companies. It's a giant money pit that lines the pockets of a select few individuals. Just because the US lags behind in federal spending doesn't contradict me. The market is clearly inefficient and parasitic."

Coronavirus,fkdl7c8,t1_fkdkngu,1584083245.0,"The real pathetic part? We *do* spend a ton on healthcare, the most per capita in the world. But it's a parasitic, inefficient system that lines the pockets of pharmaceutical and insurance industries."

starwarsspeculation,fglhfqo,t3_ez6o24,1580897919.0,"Supposedly, JJ Abrams always had the idea of giving Rey 'dark side origins' with her past. So, I'm guessing we may not have seen Rey Palpatine in Episode VIII, but some other parentage reveal that essentially would have mirrored the Vader reveal in ESB. Other users are saying it would be Rey Skywalker, but I don't particularly agree. JJ would've known that Rey Skywalker was the 'obvious' reveal after TFA, and try to get cute with it.

The ST as a whole would have been a generic rehash of the OT, but more coherent as the entire story would conform to JJ's vision. It's a matter of: do you prefer a painting 2/3rds done by an artist you dislike, with 1/3 of it by an artist you like? Or a full painting by an artist you dislike?"
