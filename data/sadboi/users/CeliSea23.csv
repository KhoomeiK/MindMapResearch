You’re a teen, we all know y’all have crazy hormones ( god made those hormones). God also created us as sexual beings you’re not doing anything wrong if it is consensual. However it’s totally up to your conviction as to why you’re going to keep doing it or not. And that will be between you and your bf and god. But be ready to proceed like adults, either way that innocence is gone. But god will still love you. He is a forgiving god and all you gotta do is say you’re sorry and boom! The grace of god kicks in and you’re in the clear. No hell. At least not for that."

Yeah sure, there are tons of other little churches in sub-groups of Christianity, just keep looking to see what is a right fit for you. Keep in mind you're looking for a right fit and not a perfect one because there is no such thing as a perfect church. Look, as a fellow Christ believer I want you to know that God will love you no matter if you're black or white or green or gay or straight. There is no mold. You just keep doing you and remember, God didn't make no mistake when you were created. Now all you can do is live your life as happy and fully as you can for the memory of your family."

But I found that just venting even if it’s just to a bunch of strangers like us here is cathartic in a way and I totally suggest you try therapy or counseling. I know, I know... “therapy” but it’s honestly helped. But I gotta tell you, you’re strong af just by admitting it to yourself and others ( via this post ). That in itself is brave and very bad ass of you. So, being that badass, don’t you owe it to yourself to just live for yourself ? ( and the kid). You’ve really nothing to lose, just by choosing to live for yourself regardless of whom enters and leaves your life. And therapy doesn’t always have to be one on one, it could be in a group too. 
Circling back, this whole feeling and fog is total balls. I know this second suggestion is also seek medical advice ? Maybe the reason you’re feeling this way is cause your brain isn’t producing enough of a chemical  and you’ve gotta correct it with antidepressants. It actually helps. 
Lastly, you’ve gotta stay alive. This sounds petty but you’ve gotta outlive your enemies.
