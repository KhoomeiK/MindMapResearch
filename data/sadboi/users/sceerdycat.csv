It hurts. You wonder why God doesn't respond to you, why doesn't he give you the answers you desperately seek? I've begged for answers for 4 years after losing someone who means the world to me.

I know how it feels to not understand the point in life...
But when you have people, animals, anyone in your life who truly loves you, needs you and cares about you, and you couldn't live without them... That will be enough reason for you to keep pressing on.

I'm sorry you're going through this, I don't know the details but I can sense your pain.

Focus on college, or if not follow what makes YOU happy. Do what you love. Or do both! Pursue a degree so you have something aligned for your future but also allow yourself time to do what you're passionate about.

If your friends aren't helping you on your journey, I hate to say it because it's not easy but try to find new friends.

And OF COURSE you deserve a beautiful life! You deserve happiness! I know it's hard to believe that when you think about your past mistakes, but we all mess up... You're human. You do deserve happiness and love. I'm so sorry you're going through this. I wish I had all the magical answers but I'm stuck in many ways myself."

My currently pretty bad anxiety is still not nearly as bad as it was during the end of my kratom use... That was hell.

I don't have to plan out my day and worry about when, where and how I'm going to dose every 3 hours. I don't have to go through hellish intermittent withdrawal due to missing a dose.

Did I mention I'm me again? Lol

I'm struggling because I have personal issues that kratom helped to mask so I'm not going to say everything is perfect but....... I'm so very happy that I finally made the jump after so many failed attempts. I'm glad I didn't give up. I had to let it go for my family and everyone I cared about. And for myself.

I'm at around 160 days.
Been having major back problems and my job is very straining on my back so it's awwwwwful. Considering keeping kratom in my car just in case..... I took a hydro 2 days when I got home last week because the pain was unbearable but I don't have anymore. I feel like I could use responsibly now (I know, I know...) But I'm very conflicted because of the guilt I have associated with it.

Sorry didn't mean for this to be a novel. Point is being a slave to a substance 24/7 is not worth it. If you can't take it occasionally (I personally DON'T KNOW if I can, because I didn't take it slowly enough in the beginning, didn't have a plan, and then it was too late), then it will become your main focal point in life, which is really... really bad.

When I was going through kratom WD baclofen honestly didn't seem to be doing much, but recently I've been able to take baclofen instead of klonopin and I surprisingly notice a difference when I don't take it. But I have generalized anxiety, I don't typically have full blown panic attacks. But considering the severity of my anxiety, baclofen could help but I don't think 10 mg (standard beginners dose) would be enough. If your panic disorder is related to kratom withdrawal it might not help but it's worth a shot.

I took K for 3 years and was at around 25 gpd in the last year. I tried CT multiple times, and it was too hard. So I tried to taper. A few times... and was unsuccessful. Until the last time. I'm at 105 days sober now, and my anxiety is finally getting more manageable, to the point that I've been able to get through my work day with baclofen instead of klonopin..... which is saying a LOT.

I have no clue why kratom withdrawal causes the breathing difficulty... but it does get better. But that was one of the hardest parts of wd for me. Wish I could tell you when it really started getting better.. I think by 2 months the issue was completely gone though, but probably sooner than that. Did you taper or quit CT?"

quittingkratom,fbml0wf,t1_fbgi88a,1576985375.0,"Yes, it was terrible. I felt I was oxygen deprived and I was exhausted. My chest was so tight. I don't think it was just anxiety either. I still deal with anxiety and it's a powerful thing but that breathing issue was something physical and out of my control. I went to the doctor to make sure I wasn't anemic. I'm at 101 days now. I'm taking full breaths again. It got better after about 2 months, but gradually got better during that time. It's the kratom withdrawal. Idk how it causes it but it does, no doubt."

cats,fb512rv,t3_eb9hpw,1576518982.0,"Thanks everyone! I've read some of these ideas but wasn't sure how well they worked, clearly you all have had some success. Think I'm gonna buy a styrofoam cooler, a cover and some straw for now."
Anxiety,f9uiyma,t3_e6t3w4,1575651723.0,"This is my life!
But this past week has been better. I think the longer I'm at this job the more comfortable I'll get... at least I hope so. Been there for about 8 months and take klonopin the days that I work (3 days a week) to cope, and for the first time I didn't take it on Wednesday and I felt ok!

Last time I tried to go without the klonopin my day fell apart, along with my brain."

And yes, it's a matter of opinion. Even if there is a large consensus that doesn't mean that some people will not be attracted to you.

I think you're way too hard on yourself."
vegan,f9m0spn,t1_f9m0ncb,1575437555.0,Oh I didn't plan to! Lol. I definitely appreciate it.
vegan,f9m0opc,t1_f9m071v,1575437454.0,"I'm so grateful he went vegan for me, he's super sweet, caring and understanding toward me. I should have mentioned that in the original post. I just care so much less about me in this situation, I want others to feel for the animals like I do. I have vegan activist friends on facebook and they're so passionate, but no one around me really is except for maybe my sister who won't be living here much longer... My Dad is actually suddenly passionate about animal rights as well which makes me so happy and proud ‚ù§ I just want my husband to be! That probably sounds selfish but it's really not about me... but I know I need to try to understand him more and just be thankful that he cares enough to not support animal ag.

I actually have Peter Singer's book and have yet to even read it myself!lol. I need to. I've been wanting to go to an animal sanctuary for a long time. I just envisioned taking my sister with me because she's a hardcore activist like me. But I'd love for him to go, just wasn't sure if he'd be interested."
vegan,f9m066r,t1_f9lzauk,1575436994.0,"That's interesting. The article talks about ways to become more empathetic on your own. Sharing that with him would be messed up. But still really informative, I didn't think about it being a big issue like that... mainly influenced by society or upbringing though. I wish I could just be a positive influence on him... jeez it took him weeks to finally start feeding the stray cats when I wasn't home even though he knows I want him to. They're hungry lonely and cold :("
vegan,f9lz1wu,t1_f9lywi1,1575435996.0,Thanks for explaining that. It's just hard for me to understand because I'm a huge empath and it's hard for me to relate to that mindset. I let it bother me too much sometimes especially when I'm in one of my depressive episodes. I needed to hear a different point of view.
Vent,f9lypfa,t1_f9lt6a8,1575435697.0,"And no no no no don't EVER call yourself that. You are beautiful and amazing. Truly. You need to love yourself before you worry about someone loving you, as cheesy as that sounds. Go after what YOU want in life... love will follow."
Vent,f9lyjw5,t3_e5t5z3,1575435564.0,"I naturally was always was more attracted to short guys. Idk why I just was. I'm married now and my husband is tall so I can't say that anymore lol

Also who's to say you're unattractive? That's a matter of opinion and not factual. Someone will find you super sexy... that's just the way it works... we all have certain characteristics that we're attracted to."
Anxiety,f9lxal1,t3_e5tw3k,1575434523.0,I assume you mean general anesthesia (if you went to the oral surgeon) which would completely knock you out so you wouldn't have to worry much about the procedure since you'd be asleep... if that helps!
Anxiety,f9ji9s4,t1_f9iyrmf,1575375484.0,"If you can't do that try an herbal supplement like kava. Take on an empty stomach. Or ashwaganda, valerian root, CBD. But also just remember that other people are nervous speaking in front of people and most people won't judge you for being nervous. I had a friend that would always shake during her school presentations... but she made it through and no one said anything about it we just understood."
Anxiety,f9ji42e,t1_f9iyrmf,1575375305.0,"For those situations I'd try to get a prescription for an anxiety med just to take occasionally. Even if it's not a benzo, there are other meds that work for some people. It's really hard to handle."
Anxiety,f9ji17s,t1_f9hgji7,1575375209.0,I'm sorry :( I really hope you find what you're looking for!
