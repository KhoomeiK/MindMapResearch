okay lmao im sorry but im laughing my ass off.   this  is literally such female-virgin logic, and ive seen it before in other female virgins.     you're not going to impress a guy by grabbing a cockroach in front of him LOL,    if I saw you do that that would actually make me really unatractted to you.

one thing i really don't understand about those type of guys  is how blind they are to the fact that associating with neckbeard  communities like incels, redpill/blackpill, mgtow, etc etc,   is so unnatractive.  and the more time you spend in those communities the more you become like them, they're so toxic.   your chances of getting laid literally decrease the more time you spend in those communities becausue they brainwash you so much. like, if i was a girl I would definetly not want to be with a guy like that either. it says a lot about your personality."

phenibut is really a functional drug, not a recreational one.  it really shines when it comes to socializing.

next time take it and go out and socalize with people. you wont even notice you're acting different probably until someone mentions it or days later when you think back to how different you were acting. thats how it works in my experience.

phenibut,fbifeyg,t1_fbausl5,1576899432.0,"holy shit i just realized i had this for about 2 weeks after i had like a  mental breakdown triggered by a night of blackout drinking  (it was building up for a long long time, that was just the trigger). it really only lasted for 2 weeks but  i'm still not completely the same 2 years later.   I had all the same symptoms as you, I  literally would have these insane  dizzy spells, and would just zone out, couldnt eat, couldn'tt get  a boner, no sex drive.  didnt realize it was   depersonalization and derealization  . I literally was scared for my life for those 2 weelks.

Anyway man Im  sure you know this but it wasnt NECESSARILY the phenibut that caused it, it was just the trigger.   it's a mental thing. I wish you the best man. I'm 22 and literally have just layed in bed the past 4 years, not going to school, work, or socializing or leaving the house.  im so mentally fucked up. maybe worse than you.  not due to any drug, but extreme depression and anxiety and other problems.   infact phenibut has helped me so much with my condition on many occasions.

I hope you know theres nothing physically wrong with you.  the  phenibut withdrawl ""traumatized"" you and now you're stuck in that mindset.   It really is just  a mental thing. I actually had this for a little after starting phenibut in high dosages.  but it went away eventually. I  I hope you can get out of it.   really wishing you the  best man!"
