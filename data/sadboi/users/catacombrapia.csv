That's why she's not as alert and even lowered her bat when he's trying to explain himself."

gentlebdsm,fn2vsit,t3_fw5m3n,1586605202.0,"These are non sexual in nature, mostly situations in which I feel responsible or protective of someone. When there is a situation that requires me to mentor somebody, like when I'm teaching somebody something I really know more about. When I hold my friend's hair when they puke from hangover, make sure they get home safely, or making sure they're well-cared for while tripsitting. When I carry my friend or my partner's bags and leading them while crossing the road to make sure it's safe to cross. When I tell somebody how great they are and how they should stop hating themselves because of it."

relationship_advice,ff32rq6,t3_eqgboo,1579532177.0,"Update: I broke up with him in my room after a discussion that we should get eggs for breakfast. I cried with monologue and everything. His reaction was ""so...are we still getting the eggs?"" I can't even with this dude :""D"
BorderlinePDisorder,fbbilzw,t3_ecbomd,1576701237.0,"I feel you. I used to masturbate when I'm anxious and I have abused porn and my own sexuality to deal with panic attacks/splitting in the past. Hell, I still turn to sex to deal with negative emotions and abandonments albeit not as severely.

Antidepressant doesnt seem to have any effect on my high drive. It's both a curse and a blessing to my partner, we served each other very well lol. But I constantly have to fight the urge to make impulsive decision of flirting/or worse sleeping with other people. I kept thinking my partner is gonna leave me anyway, why not give him a reason to (cheating, scare him away with my hypersexuality). So far I manage to keep this under control but on my darker days it's very difficult to not hurt people with my actions.

It's hard, man. It's a fucking battle (pun intended). There are days in which I felt like being sexual is the only part of my identity. I know it isn't true, but on those days I'm not sure. I'm trying to make peace with my sexuality itself and try to rely on it less to ""solve my problems"" or use it to get a fix of serotonin highs. Not sure if this will help for you but for me, I try to do sports, socialise, cook or write instead. 

I hope you find peace with this man. Stay strong. Find ways that work for you."
