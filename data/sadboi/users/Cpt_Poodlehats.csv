mentalhealth,fn5sv7t,t3_fplncz,1586674718.0,"Im still moving forward inch by inch as well. I was never taught how to drive and so Im 27 still trying to do that. I feel like I have to lie to my friends because I feel like they would think Im weird or pressure me to get a license asap. Hell, Im too afraid to go on dates because of it also. I dont know whats wrong with me, but Im making progress, dammit. That's the ONLY thing holding me back from what I want to do in life. The only thing. Im getting there though. It's tough as S-H-I-T, but I AM getting there.

Stay strong man <3"

Questions:

What was the original process like?

Did they say that during one of the Live Letters or just a normal update?"

And yeah, I completely forgot that it's ARR content so there's no way they would've known."

Do you feel like this when you're around friends?"
Animedubs,f7nbkxp,t3_buvsv8,1573893960.0,"Her work with Mikoto Misaka is EASILY my favorite by a landslide. I love every dubbed character in the Railgun and Index animes, but she outdid (and continues to outdo) herself with that role. She absolutely slays it. Definitely in my Top 5 dubbed anime roles. Just pure art all around.

I HIGHLY recommend those series by the way (they're interconnected), to those who haven't seen 'em!"
