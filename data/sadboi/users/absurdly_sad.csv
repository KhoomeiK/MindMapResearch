I found my purpose, I found it today. Because if we are going to live with regrets all of our lives, we might as well choose a purpose that you know you are going to regret tommorow.

SuicideWatch,f74ums4,t3_dud3fj,1573408239.0,"Well because we people keep asking philosophical questions on suicide instead of curing it.
I still don't know what type of mental illness I have(doctors keep diagnosing different things) so I self diagnosed myself(maybe). I one day read Lacan's theory on schizophrenia and thought it applies to me. So I asked my doctor am I schizophrenic, he laughed and said nope, don't self diagnose yourself from Google. So I said yes and forgot it. Now he has given me every drug possible and hey, I'm still suicidal. Maybe unconsciously I want to become a schizophrenic. So I self sabotage myself to become one. 
I don't what's happening to me. I have stopped giving a fuck. I sometimes overdose on Adderall to amuse myself. I create new concoctions of drugs like Adderall and Modafinil mixed with Clonazepam. That shit has also stopped amusing me now. Now I live, a hollow shell of a person, technically alive. Attempted suicide once but couldn't do it. They will give me some new drug coupled with new therapy after some time. That shit is guaranteed to work, isn't it?
Why did I write this here? Because I genuinely don't care about anyone anymore. Call me narcissistic, I don't give a fuck. So yes, to answer your question, no I don't think suicide is selfish. I think it is better than suffering from a mental illness for life."

Congress on the other hand is more cunning and works on appeasing everyone, good or bad. I hate BJP myself, but Congress makes me puke.
