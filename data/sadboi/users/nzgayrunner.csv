They can often analyse your stride, if you under/over pronate and what type of shoe will be the best fit for you. My local store even has free podiatrist fitting appointments a few times a month - if you want advice from someone properly trained. Maybe look for a store which offers that as I'm guessing other stores probably do the same thing. 

In terms of brands - I've generally stuck with Brooks since getting fitted in them - they are comfortable and I've had no issues with my running since then."

In terms of being a PT - maybe you can just focus on the exercise part of their routine, give some very generic advice (cut the amount of sugar and unhealthy fats you eat, portion control etc.) and then find a half decent site which has more detailed diet stuff if they want to explore it further. If they ask about what you eat it would give you an opportunity to say you don‚Äôt consume animal products - at that point id imagine they would either be interested in knowing more or just turn off. I‚Äôd also say it would help if you look in good shape to show what you‚Äôve achieved being vegan.

What is the living situation? If you aren't living together it might make things a little easier. If you are living together, are you jointly responsible for the lease or is it just you? If you can, talk over the plan with a friend or family member who can give you support through this especially if they live in the same city. If you can make a plan that covers the most important aspects of your life - living and such. If you live alone, maybe ask to stay at a friend's place for a bit or ask for one of them to crash at yours. However, you do not have to wait till you have a perfect plan. The most important thing is having your basic needs covered (food, shelter). The rest are added bonuses. You may doubt yourself after doing it so make sure to keep talking with friends. Make sure they know what has happened as you will need their support.

I say this as I was in the same position as you but living with my ex in his country where he had manipulated the situation so that I knew very few people.
