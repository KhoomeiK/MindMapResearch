Guess it's all just in our heads üòÇüòÅ"

bipolar,esk57at,t3_c853sn,1562051748.0,"I have Bipolar 2, also dont feel like sharing my me time with anyone. I feel weird for feeling like this. But I also see many of my friends and family getting significant others and such and I kind of want to date and have that k in nd of relationship with someone but I also want to just do my own thing."
bipolar,esbvirk,t3_c6xci1,1561812906.0,"I'm feeling that way too. I'm 27 and my parents and friends are waiting for me to have kids. In a joking manner my parents even mentioned they dont care who it is, they just want grandchildren. One of my friends gave me a deadline of 30 to get married and have a kid. I know they are all joking and such and at the moment they told me this I laughed with them because I thought it was funny. 

But it always comes back to me. I feel like I havent done what I should have done by now. I'm so far behind. Most people my age are done having kids and have bought their house and live with their significant others. 
I'm also not dating. Which causes my non immediate family members to question me every time I see them why I'm not dating. So I feel a lot of that pressure about it sometimes."
bipolar,es9afhs,t1_es9679v,1561731559.0,"It seems like it affects me when I start a menstrual cycle sometimes and lasts until after the next menstrual cycle. I wondered if it was a coincidence or if my hormone fluctuations maybe also helped induce BP symptoms and kind of wondered other peoples experience 

At first I thought i was pms-ing for like month or so. then I thought...oh that's probably not PMS anymore lol"

bipolar,es8lagm,t3_c6g2br,1561702277.0,Anybody here relapse into hypomania or depression often due to their menstrual cycle? Or do you feel it's normal menstrual symptoms?  What is it like for you?
bipolar,es8jn6m,t3_c6232p,1561700386.0,"I stopped taking it by accident. I forgot to take it when my schedule was hectic with school and work and other things. I didnt start it back up after since I lost my insurance coverage a month before. So I basically stopped it abruptly. It's been a month since I last took it.

I'm not sure how I feel yet though. It's a confusing state. I feel the same but also not. I am also dealing with constant worry of a relapse into depression."

bipolar,es8gp2k,t3_c6d0kx,1561697296.0,Skip or count is better. Lamictal has that whole rash side affect that can be life threatening. Just make sure you take it the next time. At least that's what my psych doctor told me to do if i ever failed to take it or didnt remember if I took it.
bipolar,es8fjqb,t3_c6aa9m,1561696189.0,"Lol, I can't even get this far. I'm worried doing anything different in life will set me off. Also, scared if I meet with someone who might be a killer lol. I watch too many shows where they end up being killers or obsessive stalkers. There goes my paranoia."
bipolar,es3ho0f,t1_es36rwm,1561562781.0,It truly is strange being 2 different yet same people. Not many are able to understand it. And some dont believe that our symptoms are actually real. That's the hard part is when they think we do this for attention.
bipolar,es2yert,t1_es2xlz2,1561546918.0,Yep I've had it when I've really liked someone but I ruined it when I felt the disinterest and stopped talking to them. Which was probably for the best. It sucks having to go back and apologize for it all the time. And it sucks for the person on the receiving end having to put up with it.
bipolar,es2kn7a,t3_c5llsd,1561527818.0,"I do this often as well. I  constantly feel bad about it but I just really would rather not talk to them. I apologize once everything goes back to normal. I do feel guilty once I'm normal again. I havent been able to figure out when it happens. It comes on almost randomly. I try and fight it and continue to talk to people but theres nothing there. And I get annoyed so I end up just ignoring them. It's not that they said anything annoying in particular. I can't stand to listen to anything they say because there isn't anything that interests me in their conversation. For example, my friend told me their kitten got attacked and killed by a family members dog and I couldnt muster up much sympathy. I had to fake it. In my head I thought, 'I really dont care about what happens to your kitten. Why are you telling me this?' Very unfair and messed up, but I couldn't help thinking this. But I also thought that it is a sad thing to happen and would make most people sad."
bipolar,es2j04l,t3_c5ie2m,1561526082.0,"Hello,
I'm also new here.
I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 in 2015at 24yrs. I had previously attempted suicide at 19 yrs with history of cutting since I was 15yrs old. I promised I wouldn't try anything like that again since it worried my family. I had been suffering with my symptoms after the attempted suicide but managed to seem ok to the world. At 25 I started feeling really bad, I was contemplating suicide every moment of the day for a while. I was very close to attempting suicide again. I was watching something that promotes mental health awareness and they kept saying it's ok to ask for help. It took me a while but after hearing other cases and what other people have gone through, I finally realized it really is ok to get help. I never wanted anyone to know what I was going through. It felt like something was really wrong with me. I was embarrassed by the way I felt and what I was going through. Eventually I sought help and was placed on medication and helped a lot. I did start to spiral down while on medication but once my psych dr adjusted the meds I stabilized again. I wanted to hug him and cry tears of relief but realized it probably isn't appropriate. And also I'm not a hugger, But I just felt so relieved. 

Unfortunately I have been off my medications for the past month due to insurance loss. 
Now I'm just sitting here waiting for myself to go crazy again or maybe I've already begun to go crazy lol. It's hard to figure it out sometimes. 
In the words of Jared Padalecki: ""Always Keep Fighting."""
bipolar,es2ej0t,t1_es19pnn,1561521770.0,Not necessarily happy just more what I suppose would be normal I guess. I wasnt itching to try to cut myself anymore. I wasnt getting spontaneously angry at my family members anymore. I wasnt as self conscious and nervous about every little thing. My family noticed a difference. I was able to enjoy more of the things I used to enjoy doing and actually feel up to doing them. At some point it stopped working for a while at 300mg and had to take Latuda to help it work again. Once I started stabilizing again my doctor was able to take me off Latuda. I just stayed on Lamotrigine 300mg.
bipolar,erzv3is,t3_c4vhdt,1561453207.0,For me they weren't very drastic but I started to notice I wasnt having as many suicidal thoughts. It takes a while but slowly the depression symptoms started to dissipate. I also wasnt experiencing hypomanic episodes as frequently. I would occassionally feel it but it wasnt as intense. I ended up at 300mg of Lamictal though. I had to be slowly titrated up to that dose. I didnt feel much of a difference at 150mg.
