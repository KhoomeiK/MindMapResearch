They also knew at that point three people were going to be in the running. Would have been easy for Dreamz to give the immunity to Yao and plan with him and Earl to boot Cassandra and those three go. Cassandra was just kind of there.  That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt get. Dreamz was so fixated on being in the million dollar vote he didn‚Äôt consider that being a giant asshole wouldn‚Äôt get him a thing. But he still had that truck. He could have had the truck and his integrity."

It was sudden and I remember my first thought after my sister hysterically screamed it into the phone was that I should pause Better Call Saul or I‚Äôll miss what‚Äôs going on.  I actually hung up on her bc I was using the wrong remote control.

Needless to say, from the moment the news hits you until...I don‚Äôt know when... it‚Äôs weird. It‚Äôs painful. You have ups and downs.  You deal.  The worst part is, everyone around you starts to go back to normal and your heart is still missing something.

I almost miss the days after, when my mom and sister and I were just crying at the family house and buying each other McDonald‚Äôs and throwing it up in the sink.  When we kept him alive a little longer by having people to call and tell and talk about it.  When we still had things to handle, like his phone and his prescriptions and just everything to stay busy that kept his presence there.

I think the worst part was a couple months after when the headstone went up and the grass started to grow. There was no more. Life went on. The shitty terrible crying and losing it feeling goes away, but there‚Äôs a sad emptiness that stays. Everyone deals and handles differently, but I can honestly say most could agree with the ‚Äúyou mean life goes on and I‚Äôm supposed to just be normal now??‚Äù part."
