What I \*TRY\* to do is limit myself to one game of each genre at a time. I'm failing in this currently because I just bought a new console and am all over the place with my gameplay, but generally I try to play one game at a time.

Open world game: Assassin's Creed Odessey (PC)

3rd Person Shooter: Uncharted 4 (PS4)

1st Person Shooter: Outer Worlds (PC)

JRPG: (This is where I'm breaking my rule, as I'm currently Juggling Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1 (PC), Octopath Traveller (Switch), Pokemon Shield (Switch), Dragon Quest (Switch) )

Tactical RPG: Mario vs. Rabbids Kingdom Battle (Switch)

Rhythm: Beat Saber (PC)

Side Scroller: The Messenger (PC)

Roguelike: The Binding of Isaac (Switch)

I'm sure there's others, but I'm not thinking right now about what they are. VR I play when I can, but I have a new puppy and mostly haven't been playing that cause of her, save my beat saber exercise sessions.

Generally I'll play the same games until they finish, so they sit at the top of my recently played queue on PS4, Switch, and PC. 

I just ask myself 'what type of game do I feel like playing today' and then play the game of that type from my 'currently playing' list"
