AskReddit,fjuvlhn,t3_few10e,1583620683.0,"""Is this natural/organic?""

 This is context based but when it comes to products such as skincare/makeup/household products I gotta give an eyeroll. Natural does not equal green! It doesn't always mean that its sustainably and/or ethically sourced. Why are we using agricultural spaces that are not biodiverse to create such products. 

We can make the same amount of products locally with less resources (eg/ transportation, harvesting, water) and with the same molecular biology. An example I can give is that it takes about 30 roses to make approximately 1 drop of rose oil whereas you can make a lot more in lab with the same molecular biology. 

The fearmongering of 'chemicals' is doing more damage to the earth. The easy of just throwing around the word 'natural' or 'sustainable' without having information to back it up is so dominant.  I understand how it's become normalized and people cant know what they dont know. Thankfully there are some companies and organizations of chemists that are trying to dispel such misinformation and promoting sustainable practices! So my eyeroll goes towards the fearmongering practices/frameworkc"

We have completely different personalities to the point where we actually wouldnt be friends. However, we vibe. We are friends because we both live with bipolar. Despite having experiencing mania differently, I do feel that connection as we have both fundamentally suffered in the same way and continue to do so. I will say that at one point it was enabling bad habits we use to cope. We would do those bad habits together. However we knew we had to stop  for the sake of our lives and our loved ones.

Anything in particular that make lead you to apologize a lot? For me I find that it happens when I'm hyper aware of my movements, posture, tone of voice, what I'm saying, etc. I think I get hyper aware when I get nervous that someone might detect that I'm bipolar (not many people know) or somewhat something is wrong with me. I sometimes get hyper aware when I've been going through weird episodes and just need to be more aware of what's going on and that sometimes I might hurt someone. This just leads me to try really hard to gafe what the person/group I am talking to is feeling g or thinking. Every pause I count its duration, i try to interpret eye movements, body language, I analyze responses, etc. Ofc this type of anxiety can lead to negative thoughts. So I apologize a lot thinking that o may have hurt someone. I'm not sure if this makes sense"
bipolar,f7vdeb5,t3_dxg1xe,1574022740.0,"Wowza. I actually feel a bit better coming across this as I've been experiencing something similar. It gets frustrating when there's clearly judgements and assumptions made about the things that I do and the boundaries that I put up myself. I'm getting use to not feeling the urge to either justify or defend myself. At the end of the day, what's the point? This urge stems from caring about what other people think which I'm trying to care less about as it creates a lot of toxicity for me. It definitely gets frustrating because no one can really know what you're experiencing, how you're experiencing it, and why. We dknt even know that ourselves"

SustainableFashion,f7eplet,t3_dphp48,1573663011.0,"This is super cool! It's a great way to show the many possibilities of upcycling things into practical things. It also raises great conversation/debate points too in terms of environmental issues and sustainability which would be great to hear from professionals. By using cuts from a company and reducing their disposal costs, would this still be supporting an industry that is already contributing to the amount of stuff we have in this world?  What resources are being used to create these upcycled items (eg/ production, shipping) and does it address social issues that are connected to environmental ones. Yet on the other hand, the fashion industry won't just 'stop' overnight. Waste is still going to be produced. So if we are speaking in terms of 'immediate' and I guess 'larger scale' solutions, this is great because these cuts contribute a significant amount of waste and is now literally being diverted from landfill.  On a larger scale, will a transition to a more sustainable system for the top companies that are contributing to the most emissions and environmental impact ever occur? Of course this has lots of layers and complexities to it"

bipolar,exc71qd,t1_evdsfh4,1566144682.0,He was on the show with Letterman in 2018 and he says that he believes his version of bipolar is a luxury version. He acknowledges that other people have different experiences and are experiencing more debilitating aspects of it than him. He knows that other people have it worse and cannot function without medication. I believe he is trying his best to not entirely hate this aspect of him so he is trying to find something good about it.  He absolutely didnt sign up to be an advocate. It's absolutely hurtful that people of the bipolar community are attacking another person with bipolar. We all have different personalities and experience it differently but the last thing we need is more people showing disgust to someone with bipolar...ESPECIALLY from people who already have bipolar. This forum has left a bad taste in my mouth unfortunately. I was hoping we'd all be open minded to other people's experiences. We of all people know that people with bipolar experience different levels of it.
