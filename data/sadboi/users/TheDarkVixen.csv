depression_help,fr33j49,t1_fr2xw0t,1589849213.0,"I’m sorry people make fun of your singing, it hurts when people do that. I’m glad that you did find a place where you can sing freely. We have a swing set in our backyard, and when my parents are at work and my brother is doing his schoolwork downstairs, I go out to the swing and sing. I put my headphones on and just sing. Lately I’ve been doing it more often, but at the same time I’m still constantly afraid the neighbors will hear me and judge. I wish I had a place where I could sing without fear, but for now it’s all I have. I’m trying to not be as scared when singing, and to not care what others think in general, it’s just hard. But thank you for the advice, I’ll try to take it to heart. I really appreciate it."
depression_help,fr31lr7,t1_fr1yoby,1589848115.0,"thank you so much. Music has always impacted me greatly, and I’ve always wanted to make my own, I’m just scared to do so. Even though that may be the truth, I still sing when I’m sad. Sometimes I just sing random lyrics and notes, just to get stuff out. It’s just I’ve always wanted to share my music with others, and make them feel the happiness other musicians have given me. I wish I wasn’t so hard on myself, but I don’t entirely know how to not be. I am grateful that you took the time to write this. I feel like I say this a lot, but thank you for your words. It means a lot to me."

It would be nice to talk, but I don’t really know how to explain what’s going on. I’m sorry, but thank you so much for offering. Thank you"
SuicideWatch,fntz8ba,t1_fntxbk6,1587251439.0,"Thank you. I’ve calmed down a little bit but I’m still pretty scared.

It would be nice to talk and I appreciate it but I don’t really want to make you feel bad. Thank you though. Thank you for being caring."
SuicideWatch,fnq8r9q,t3_g3399n,1587159860.0,I relate a lot to you. I’m sorry you are going through this and I’m sorry I can’t do much to help. I wish I could give you a hug. I don’t really know what to say other than that you are in my thoughts. I see myself in your words. I can relate so much. I don’t know you but I hope you are still here.

I’m glad other people feel the way I do, and understand. I never thought of it as strength, being with a villain, but I think you made me realize it is. I don’t know if I’ll post again but I’ll see. Thank you so much. You don’t know how much your words mean to me."
LoveNikki,fgnprjc,t1_fgnooq3,1580950192.0,"I get the message, “Update Download Failed Decompression Failed 400”. I did make the big mistake of trying to redownload the game to see if it would work, but now I’m in an even bigger mess because I can’t download anything at all now. My dad tried to download the game on his iPad to see if it worked and it didn’t, so at least we know it’s them. I really hope they fix it, I was really excited about the update too. Let’s have hope they fix whatever’s  going on so we can play again!"

It’s been like this for a whole day, and I haven’t been able to play. To be honest, I’ve been playing for two years and haven’t missed a day, it’s fine for now but I’m worried that I won’t be able to play again. I apologize I wasn’t able to help, just wanted to say you aren’t alone, it is happening to me too."

I really appreciate all of the support. I didn’t expect this post to blow up like it did. I feel bad that so many of you are worrying about me. But thank you, from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. 


To the people that got downvoted: I wish you the best. I know you may roll your eyes at me, but I really do hope you are ok. I hope you know I forgive you for being mean. I forgive you."
SuicideWatch,fec6j49,t3_eo9o49,1578967480.0,"I got back from the library about an hour ago not expecting this. I thought it would be my last visit to the library, and this post would be meaningless. I thought the night would be my last, and by morning I would be gone. I thought nobody would care. 


I honestly started sobbing when I saw all the replies, messages, chat requests and the award. I read each and every one of the replies and messages and thought about each one. I thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart. I truly, truly do. I would chat with the ones who wanted to, but I wouldn’t know who to chose and I already have someone I’m chatting with. I will try to reply to the messages and some of the replies, but it’ll take a while so I wanted to make a  big reply so you know I’m ok.




I told my dad about how I am feeling. I feel a bit better now, but I would probably would’ve been gone if it weren’t for you guys. You’ve given me hope, enough to make me rethink my decision and live another day. I can’t say this won’t happen again, but for the time being I think I’m going to be ok. Thank you so much. I love you all.  Thank you"

I’m glad you reached out on reddit for help, you are very brave to do that. It’s hard asking for help, believe me I know. I’m also 13 and female, believe it or not. I joined reddit a while back ago when I was at my breaking point. I’m still not ok, but I’m trying to get through it. I know you are probably under a lot of stress right now, but take a moment to take a deep breath. Please remember you are worth it and you have a right to follow your dreams. I’m not the best at giving advice, but I feel your pain. I wish I could give you a hug but a virtual hug is the best I can do. Please have hope ❤️"

The only feedback I can give is to try to have the pacing follow a pattern, but it’s just a suggestion. Like for example, the words “my friend with a name and a smile”, maybe have that come after every few lines or every few syllables. It may make it flow more. Maybe play around with rearranging some lines and such. But again, it is just a suggestion. I do like it as it is. It is very beautiful and it touched my heart.
