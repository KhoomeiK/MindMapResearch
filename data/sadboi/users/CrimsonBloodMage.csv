AskReddit,eviyu44,t3_cjsq0b,1564552166.0,"I personally am still conflicted atm whether they are real or not but my personal experience that made me think they are was in highschool. So, I was in my 3rd period environmental science class which was still around morning time, and I'm a sleeper during the day no doubt about it. So I get in a comfortable position lay my head down to catch some quick Z's. Now I sit in the back of the class (perfect for being least likely to get caught) and bout 5 minutes in I feel a smack on arm....I look up thinking it was the teacher or someone was fucking with me and nothing of the sort had done it. I shrug it off and go right back to sleep when a few moments later I get smack on the back of my fucking neck. I shot up thinking ""alright who wants to die today"" and remember theres no one behind me as I sit in the back. The student next to me Ik for a fact did not touch me because of how oblivious they looked. Got very wary and stayed up for the rest of the class. I feel like some teacher or student died in there and wanted me to pay attention but jeez for a ghost the smacking felt so real."
