prolife,foras9f,t3_g920xa,1588009075.0,"I think education is the key. I think abortions should be illegal, but I also know that things aren't quite that easy and people will still have them. At the bare minimum, we need to educate people. If someone wants a baby, it's a life and a baby. If someone miscarries we're sad for them. If someone doesn't want a baby, it's not human and it isn't a baby. There are plenty of organizations that help with having a baby — making it affordable. I also have 0 doubt in my mind that if you go up to any church and say ""I don't have money, so I'm going to abort"" that the church will help out. Even people who aren't Christians. As someone else pointed out, in countries with free healthcare, there are still abortions. A lot of it is the attitude, lying to ourselves and lack of education. Why do abortion clinics not show you the ultrasound? 

At the bare minimum, there should be a plethora of information, saying both the pros and cons. Yes, if you abort the baby you don't have to be pregnant for around 10 months. Yes, it will probably be less stressful. Yes, then you won't have to deal with the baby for the rest of your life, or you wont have to feel the awful pain of giving up your child. HOWEVER, the cons (killing a living being) is youre deciding what life is. You're deciding who gets to live or die, you decide the worth of that baby and you choose death. You will rob that baby completely of its choice because you can't carry a baby for around 10 months. Taking away an average life expectancy of 68+ years for 10 months. You share about cells, DNA, you make them listen to the heartbeat and look at the ultrasound. You give them all the information they need and make it difficult (time consuming with all the info) because it is a difficult decision. Then you let them go for a couple of days and they come back and talk to them again about it, hearing from both sides. The death penalty and euthanasia are all taken seriously, presenting facts and making sure this is what needs to be done. The same should be done for abortion. I understand it gets harder to kill the baby as time goes on (it grows oops), but I believe at least a week should go by. Really, it should be weeks. What if the woman isn't completely in the right mind? Haven't we all had times where we're in a mindset and then later realize that's not how we felt?

dating_advice,fojlm2d,t3_g7rcgf,1587824048.0,"It's incredibly sexist and I don't like it. Sometimes I realize I have sexist thoughts that I think are right, but I can tell they are not. For example, although I believe in splitting the bill, a part of me also thinks a man should do it. In our society, if a man doesn't do it, he's considered bad. Then again, IM NOT A CHILD! Why should he have to give all his money??? Why does everything still suck for the guy (girls are spoiled), but then if a guy says ""I want you to stay home with the kids"" all hell breaks loose? That sounds sexist to me, but someone saying a man should pay doesn't elicit as much anger. In short, I know that's wrong. I love my SO and I try to treat him well. I actually came on to him first by telling him I'm attracted to him. He was first to tell me he loves me, but I always tell him he's sexy. I told him that I want him to really understand that. Girls are always considered sexy and desirable, but men never really are told these things. 

I've bought him some really nice gifts that made him cry 😭 because no one has ever done that. Ive told him soo many things that he says ""no one ever said this"". HE HAD AN EX-FIANCE and sometimes it makes me blood boil. How dare she not treasure him? Anyways, we're actually long distance, but when we meet I'm going to romance him. I plan on bringing flowers, chocolates, wearing a cute dress and smiling. I'll have a card and we've always joked about pop rings for some reason.

It's there but I don't know if a test can actually quantify it or prove it.

If it isn't God, then something weird has been happening the past seven years. Long story short, there have been times when I've heard or said things that couldn't really be known. My first experience was when I was annoyed and thinking in my head, questioning different things about God. Just then someone came up on stage and I had never heard of people getting an actual word from the Lord. I thought ""this should be great"" and then I continued my grumbling. Well the thing is that I was focused on what I was thinking and then realized the lady was answering my questions. Not only answering them, but rephrasing them. I probably am worse than doubting Thomas so I asked about ten different questions while sweating and then just sat quietly because I was like ""what the heck"". Honestly, it scared the crap out of me. I think I believed in mind-readers more. Then there was another time I saw someone and felt like I needed to talk to her. This naggy feeling. I'm a pretty shy person and I went to her and hugged her, which really is something I never do (and have not done since). I started pouring out words about her life and answering different questions she had. The thing is, she didn't ask me and questions. The words just came to me though, I can't explain it at all so I'd understand that people would think I'm crazy. 

I've had a lot of different things like that, **but no, I do not have a system** that magically says ""from God"" or not from God. I have a couple of options, I can ignore what I've felt and seen, I guess I can say I'm a mind-reader... but somehow I don't think that's the case.  This is probably an awful example, but what system do we have to verify that the sun will be there tomorrow? Do we really have any proof? Our proof is that it has been there and was here today. That's sort of like my system for God, it's just there. I could go more into why I think it is God speaking to me, but somehow I never learned how to write a little bit.

Islam: 
Why do you ask the people of the scripture about anything while your Book which has been revealed to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is newer and the latest? You read it pure, undistorted and unchanged, and Allah has told you that the people of the scripture changed their scripture and distorted it, and wrote the scripture with their own hands and said, 'It is from Allah,' to sell it for a little gain. Does not the knowledge which has come to you prevent you from asking them about anything? No, by Allah, we have never seen any man from them asking you regarding what has been revealed to you!"" Sahih Bukhari 7363, Book 96, Hadith 90. In the Qur'an it says to follow the Gospels and Torah, but it also states that Jesus was not God.

And because of their saying (boasting), ‘We killed Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah,’ - but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it was made to appear to them so."" an-Nisaa’ 4:157

Quran (5:51) - ""O you who believe! do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people

There are plenty of verses, I'm not sure what you wanted me to expand on exactly. If you google it, you'll find a lot of Imams try to seem accepting to Christians/nonbelievers. They can do this because taqiya and also because the Qur'an goes back and forth. One verse Christians and Jews are bad, others they're okay. One verse says you can befriend nonbelievers (interestingly enough when Muhammad didnt have a lot of power - I mean followers) and another says not to. If you know anyone that speaks Arabic and isnt Muslim, have them read Muslim questions and explanations. 

They try to hide things in their religion because it isn't really PC. Although, you can find questions my muslims in English sometimes - you'll probably learn the most there. I remember reading about one poor woman who asked what she should do because her new husband has sex with her daily and she doesn't want to because it hurts. They quoted this verse:

The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘If a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses [and does not come], and he spends the night angry with her, the angels will curse her until morning.’”

Regardless of what Islam says about Christianity, you should view what it says in general. Do you really want to follow a religion where the leader had sex with a 9 y/o? Do you want to follow a leader whose child bride (Aisha) even said no one suffers more than Muslim woman? That Muhammad has made women as equal to asses and dogs? A religion that allows you to have 4 wives? That allows you to hit your wife? A religion that doesn't even guarantee if you go to heaven? A religion that gives you a 2 women to have sex with in heaven? A religion that talks about how many times Muhammad has sex in one night with his 9 wives at once?"

Christianity,fmm2te9,t1_fmj3hdi,1586197737.0,"**Father**

I think what the person was getting at was the MEANING behind father. Jesus was not saying don't call anyone father as in now don't call your biological/adoptive father ""father"". That's literal. It's the act of saying ""father"" like the person is over you. It's a title of respect and authority. It's just like in the verse it says not to be called a teacher. If it's taking the term in a literal sense - okay. Someone who does the act of teaching is a teacher. That's okay. What Jesus seemed to be saying was that He is the ***I am***. Everything taught, anything you have is from God. So do not act like you are a teacher, because really you're just repeating things from God the actual teacher. This verse comes to mind: [1 Corinthians 1:26-30](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/1.htm). 

What protestants have a problem with is some of the AUTHORITY given to religious leaders in Catholicism. 

Answer me this: **Why do you call your ""fathers,"" father (not the biological or adoptive father)?** 

**Mediators**

There is nothing wrong asking someone to pray for you. However, that is not their claim. Their claim is two things 1) it isn't them, but God who forgives. You are correct the verse before it says to pray to God for others, but it then it says **JESUS** mediates for us. We do not mediate for anyone, we ask for intervention then Jesus mediates. Jesus was put in our form to experience what we go through and through His death he mediates for us. We do not have the ability to mediate. Jesus resolves the argument, he mediates the problem through HIS sacrifice. We are unable to resolve someone who is sinful, we merely can ask Jesus to mediate them. 2) it says in the Bible not to pray to dead people in multiple times. The saints and Mary are dead. If you'd like I can give the verses.

If Mary was alive now and prayed for me, that's okay and biblical. If my salvation depends on Mary's prayer, that's unbiblical. Mary cannot mediate, as said in the Bible. Before it says **we can pray** and then the **MEDIATOR, Jesus, who mediates between GOD and MAN.**

**Mary** 

*Greek word: makários* (""blessed"") describes a believer in *enviable* (""fortunate"") position from receiving *God's provisions* (*favor*) – which (literally) *extend* (""make long, large"") His grace (benefits). 

All Christians are blessed.  

“Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, whose trust is the Lord."" Jeremiah 17:7

To be blessed means you receive things. She was blessed because she got to bear Jesus, meaning, she received God's favor as we all do. It doesn't say ""she was the most blessed"". It just said she will be considered blessed, which by the way, isn't a great argument. Mary was blessed, but just because someone is called blessed doesn't mean they actually are:

'So now we call the arrogant blessed; not only are the doers of wickedness built up but they also test God and escape.'"" The miraculous thing about Mary is Jesus. She is blessed because she had the privilege of carrying Jesus. We are also blessed for Jesus dying for our sins. 

 

She did this better than anyone else excluding Christ. Where is this in the Bible? Can I see a fact check?

I can address other parts, but really your whole claim is that she is revered because she was blessed. Guess what? A lot of people were blessed in the Bible before Jesus and then it says all Christians are blessed. Mary was good, she obeyed God, but **she also sinned.** There are Christians today and in the past thousands of years who obeyed God, but also sinned. Some are blessed with the ability to sing and other to prophesize... that doesn't mean they're greater than another (actually it talks about this in the Bible). 

Again, where does it say Mary did better than everyone? The verses you gave truly do not prove anything. If you're curious I can break each one down for you. Jesus was CLEAR. Why are you listing that people were excited Mary came? Don't you know people also fell down to worship angels? To worship John the Baptist? Does that make it right? NO! DO **NOT** follow what people do or say, follow what JESUS says. What did Jesus say?

Luke 8:  

**19** Now Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd. **20** Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”

**21** He replied, “My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s word and put it into practice.”

**Truly, can you tell me what this means? Why did Jesus say it? Why did he make no distinction between his mother and everyone else? Why did no one pray to Mary in the Bible? Why did no one pray to saints? Why does it say to pray to God and not mention anyone else if it's acceptable? Why would Jesus give us the Holy Spirit and break the temple veil if we couldn't go straight to Jesus? Why pray to Mary or Saints?**

Why does the rosary prayer mention Mary more than Jesus?

They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers. Acts 1:14 There is no where in the Bible it says to pray to people. Even when they were with Mary, no one prayed to her in the Bible.

**Manmade**

Protestantism is not a new religion. It's merely going back to what the heart of Christianity was. The original heart of Christianity was the trinity, a relationship and the Bible (as seen in the Bible). Protestantism was getting away from manmade things in the Catholic church.  The Catholic church has evolved. For example, the first historical mention of praying to Mary was 300 years after Jesus. The first Christians do not resemble Catholics today. They do not even resemble Protestants today, but I believe we resemble them the most in the heart. What I mean by that is that first they were Jewish Christians. I strongly urge you to look at the history of Christianity. Look at Catholic, Protestant and atheist/agnostic history of Christianity. That way it should not be as biased.

Normally then I say ""here I am, take me all"".

But then I also struggle because there are some verses that talk about if you sin you don't follow God and we'll be pruned from the tree. I know Jesus leaves the 99 for the 1. I know it's God who saves us, but at the same time we do have to make somewhat of a step. Jesus does go after us, but there are times we have to say ""yes I'll follow you"" or ""I won't do this anymore"". I think that's where I struggle. 

However, what I think I'm learning is that it is about the heart. We are wicked, we are sinful. We need to constantly renew our mind. We need the Holy Spirit, we cannot do anything without the God. My thought was to make a covenant with God - I have it on my notepad. I will fail again, but I will praise Him. I will do well again and I will praise Him. I think where I get so dismayed is I think ""I won't do it again God!"" or ""I wont do it if I love you"". When I fail I feel rotten, but I think that's because I'm not quite getting it. *I need help.* I need God and I overestimate myself even though it turns into loathing (I don't know if that makes sense, I try to understand myself). I think it may be a source of pride.

So, my covenant is to accept that I am sinful. I'm going to fail God - it's inevitable. It isn't about me, it's about Him. No matter what happens I will praise Him instead of focusing on what I did or think I will do. After all, who is my God? Will He not save me? I believe He will so then I ask myself, ""Why are you worried?"" Just wait patiently, seek Him in every moment and tell Him your heart (even if that means all I can utter is ""help"")."
Christian,fmln4je,t1_fmjkr7b,1586189613.0,"Thank you! That made me think of the song ""Keep Your Eyes on Me"" by Tim McGraw & Faith Hill. 

Thankfully, God gots this. I happened to just look up at my wall that have verses and you know which one my eyes immediately went to? ""Wait for the Lord and be strong. Take heart and wait for the Lord"" then the other one my eyes darted to was ""Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding""

It is well with my soul. Truly, the verse you listed is great. I know what I have to do. It's like when God first put in my heart to pray to know Him. The first day nothing happened. The second day nothing happened.

Now, I see the battle raging within me and it is strong. I know He is here and I know my thinking isn't correct, but it doesn't change how I feel. That is something I am learning - sometimes it doesn't matter how you feel. It doesn't matter that you really feel like sinning. It doesn't matter that you feel like God isn't here. The truth, the reality, is that we have to deny our flesh and that He is here! It's just so difficult. I once wrote this and this it comes into my mind:

Though I can see, I walk as if I were blind. Oh wretched soul, at least the blind do it when they cannot see, but you who can see clearly walk to your own death. 

Another verse repeats in my head randomly sometimes from Isaiah that says ""Awake, awake!""

Christianity,fmjbqmp,t1_fmj4d41,1586127070.0,"Do you disagree with the Bible? 
After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were ALL filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.
Acts 4:31
Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Galatians 3:2
But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His Romans 8:9
Okay so, we all have the spirit, check.


If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you. James 1:5 
Okay so we can get wisdom from God, (ANY OF US), check.

But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. John 16:13...
So what are you disagreeing with exactly?
We are to ""meditate on his law day and night"" -Psalms 1:2
We are to hide the word in our heart... Did it say after someone tells you what it means? No. The Bible says the Holy Spirit will go before us and guide us.

Jesus called away with rituals and religion, something that Catholics later brought back (no, not Peter and the church-- which by the way was not Catholic). Jesus called for a personal relationship and through Jesus we are all equal. 

What interpretation is that really? Protestants agree on the main important things - I'd say the different churches are way closer than we are with Catholics. Some churches vow to not do certain things because it causes problems (e.g. Baptist not drinking alcohol). That is personal, it isn't because the Bible said so. Then the other part because... people aren't perfect? It says in the Bible there will be false prophets and demons will masquerade as light. It says believers will go astray. However, I hardly think Pentecostals and nondenominationals truly disagree, nor baptists, nor Presbyterians... We believe in the trinity. The disciples disagreed, the early church disagreed. What do you make of that? 

And really no two can agree? Next time say that most or a lot of them can't agree on. I have gone to several different churches and I am non-denominational myself (because I don't follow a church, I follow God and the Bible). I have yet to find a differing belief between us EXCEPT personal statements such as: ""in the bible it says not to be drunk, therefore, my church and I will not drink so that temptation does not occur"". It isn't ""THE BIBLE SAYS"" and then ""NOOO, I THINK IT SAYS.""

I have also yet to see a lot of churches say ""this is how a verse is"". Generally they give the facts (historical references, what they think, what others think and they say what they feel like God has told them). Normally how the Holy Spirit works (as it has when talking to you) is as you're asking for guidance the Lord puts scripture in your head. Scripture backs up scripture.

I'm curious, have you read the complete Bible? Have you ever felt the Holy Spirit? Has the Holy Spirit ever talked to you?"
Christianity,fmj8blc,t1_fmj08g0,1586125084.0,"That's sad then, it sounds like you do not have any hope. Perhaps what you could do then is make a post or link the post were everything is explained? I never said Catholics do not try to offer explanations or produce evidence, I merely said you guys did not. I do not agree with Catholics, but I'm not against you guys. I see what you're saying, maybe we just have too differing of beliefs. 

My thought is that I'd rather waste a second to send a post because maybe the OP won't be engaged, but someone else will. It doesn't hurt to copy and paste or send a link - in fact it takes about 5 seconds. The ""truth,"" should always be spread. I encourage you to do that, even though I do not agree. 

We must not grow tired of spreading the truth. It isn't for nothing, if it's true, does God not see that? If you have to explain to someone 77 times isn't that better if there is a chance they see? Nonetheless, I said I'd like to see the proof. You are not obligated to share anything, but if you've posted it before I'm sure you could reproduce it/copy it. 

I must say though, if it's information from a catholic website w/o Bible verses or any historical backing, you probably will lose 99% of people. I only say this because the Catholic websites I have looked at don't seem to like to focus on the Bible, but rather what saints, popes, priests and etc. say. I don't follow them...

I think that's because a lot of Christians try to proclaim something is so when they have not really consulted God. Do you believe in the Bible? It says that he guides **us (His children)** to the truth. This is what JESUS said. I don't know why there are disagreements, other than what the Bible says: 

* **We aren't perfect** as humans, no one is (including the church created by people and religious leaders like the pope).
* We have to renew our minds each day. The Holy spirit guides us, but we easily fall to sin.
* Christians since the beginning questioned and had disagreements, this is found with the 12 disciples and the churches Paul & Timothy addressed. Read Galatians 2:11-13, Peter had some issues there and were disagreements. Does that mean neither Paul nor Peter had the Holy Spirit? No, we just aren't perfect. Also, Peter disagreed w/ God at one point by denying Jesus three times. Everyone, priest, nondenominational Christian and catholic are not perfect.  So I'll ask you - How do you know priests/saints have the right information? The same reason non-denominational Christians do - through the Holy Spirit. Does that mean we know everything? No, but that's another question...I think it isn't an error w/ God, but an error w/ us. The Holy Spirit does GUIDE us. He speaks to us, but sometimes WE do not listen. That doesn't discredit God's word or that every believer can have wisdom from God.
* It  says to go back and forth w/ multiple leaders who hear from the Lord:  Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.   **1 Corinthians 14:29** 
* Some people are false;  Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world  1 John 4:1 Satan masquerades as an angel of light - Jesus warned us of this.
*  For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.  Matthew 24:24
* His thoughts are not our thoughts, his ways are not our ways. It's easy for Christians to get messed up on reading God's word because we are imperfect.
* The question isn't for me, but more for God/understanding God because Jesus clearly says:
   *   As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit—just as it has taught you, remain in him.  1 John 2:27
   *   Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will. Romans 12:2 Other verses talk about this too, but since I think I've written too much already check out Proverbs 2:1-5 if you're interested.

Scripture has gone under incredible scrutiny. Authenticity is looked at. I cannot remember the exact council/board that deals with this, but I remember being impressed. When I finish studying I find it for you.

God is perfect. Evolution doesn't contradict the Bible because it never said in the Bible that we do not evolve/change. It isn't mentioned. You could say if for 100% we were ""monkeys"" then that contradicts the Bible if Adam and Eve were the first humans. 

Supposedly in Judaism the garden of Eden is supposed to all be figurative. The supposed thought is that apes and humans have a common ancestor - the two branched off. The reason why they believe this is because of our DNA. It's well-supported, but it isn't proven. Science changes all the time and if you do a deep search about our evolution from ""monkeys"" as you said, evidence seems to be sparse IMO.

&#x200B;

Nonetheless, even if it were true I don't know if I would say it rules out what the Bible say if it's taken figuratively. Also, is it not possible for God to create separate beings with similar DNA? It doesn't mean that they had to come from them. God can make things from thin air. Likewise, almost every animal seems to have similar DNA as we do. DNA was discovered less than 200 years ago, we're testing things based off of our own ""tests,"" our own ""tools"".

Also check her legs, touching both legs and feeling temperature. Is her leg swelling? Does it feel cold? Hot? Does it feel hard? Can she check her pulse?

If she can find the pulse on one foot and not the other that is a BAD sign. If she can't find either that may be understandable, so it is important she compares each leg to each other. 

IMPORTANT: UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should she RUB her leg. If it is a clot and she rubs it, it could travel and become a pulmonary embolism which could result in death. If she suddenly has shortness of breath, that could be a sign of pulmonary embolism and she'll need to go to the doctor's ASAP. 

She should walk around and probably elevate her leg above heart level, but I'd make sure with a nurse. Can your mother call her doctor's office? I know things are busy now, but it may be good to call. At the bare minimum, please call a free nurse hotline such as this:

I've also heard hydration, diet, limiting noises & lights 30 mins to hours before you sleep can help. Exercise is good too if it can be done earlier in the day.

Sorry for the long post. I am with a wonderful man right now that was severely depressed. He did not leave his house really for a year. For 10+ years he has been in excruciating pain. He felt ugly, worthless and was not loved how he should. Like me, he thought nothing would ever change. Do you know what he did yesterday? He cried/almost cried because I gave him a valentine's gift from my heart. If you would have asked him a year ago if he would meet someone like me, that he would be doing better like he is now and feel loved, he would have told you ""no way"". None of his medication ever worked, but he finally found something that does. Just because you haven't experienced it, doesn't mean you won't. There will be pain on this earth, but there is also happiness. I cannot guarantee you that everything will be okay, but I do know for one thing, if you end your life you 100% will never have any of that."
legaladvice,fczlr1p,t1_fcwnz2g,1578103993.0,"Thank you for replying! It helps to get an opinion from someone in the medical field. I believe I had some poor wording on my part. I did not mean to say it was dangerous, but that I think it **may** be dangerous. I wrote ""I think,"" but I can see how that could be viewed as I'm stating it like it's a fact when I meant to say it like a possibility. I understand that many medical professionals would not ask patients to check their blood sugar, but I'm assuming that's for a healthy patient that has a normal blood sugar. Under side effects for Metformin on WebMD it says the following: "" It is a good habit to carry glucose tablets or gel to treat low blood sugar."" It goes on to talk about diet. It says that because a side effect is hypoglycemia. However, this is talking about hypoglycemia that may come about for patients being treated for **hyperglycemia**. My thought (which of course I will admit I do not know everything, but this is based on my understanding) is that if say your blood sugar is at 130 and Metformin lowers it to under 100, that's okay. If you're healthy and your blood sugar is at 92 and lowers it to 80 that's okay. However, if you have a blood glucose of 55 and take a drug that lowers blood sugar... will it not lower it anymore? Couldn't that lower her bs to below 40? It's generally okay for those with normal blood sugars because they can still have lower blood sugars before they become hypoglycemic. However, if you already have hypoglycemia I would think that could cause issues. 

I have not had my thyroid levels tested in awhile, but in the past I always got the T3 and T4 tested just in case. You said ""usually"" do not treat. I think if I did not have a family history of people almost dying d/t thyroid issues it would be fine to just test the TSH. I do not think it's unreasonable to ask for my T3 and T4, especially since I was able to get it through my last doctor. 

I'm not sure if you would know this, but does it hurt anything to report her? My thought is that the board will review it and if they think something is problematic they will act, if not it will be dismissed. That does not mean that I'm not taking it seriously, as I wrote in another post I'm at the beginning stage of thinking of reporting her. I would obviously write differently if I wrote a complaint and would not include everything. I wrote this post to see what others thought and wanted to give all the details. 

&#x200B;

I hope that patients will share with me if they feel like something is off and I have no problem with someone reporting me for things. I may be naive, but I figure if they make complaints against me that aren't warranted then I'll be okay, if they are warranted I'd rather get in trouble. I do not want to ever hurt patients or do anything wrong. My priority will always be my patients, I have no problem with taking responsibility and I'd rather be corrected/have my license taken away than hurt people. 

I really appreciate the time you have taken to read and reply to my post. Thank you! I hope I did not come off as a know-it-all, that is not my intent. I came here for advice because I feel like there are concerning patterns I have seen from this doctor and I have a passion for patient safety."
legaladvice,fczhe2z,t1_fcx7r2t,1578101298.0,"I think that many doctors and nurses may relax when they hear a patient is in the medical field, but that does not mean it is right. Do I think that alone is enough to report her? No. My main point from my post is to show that she seems to lack care for her patients. This is not a problem for someone who just needs a checkup, it could be a problem for someone with serious health issues (that's what worries me, for the patients who do not know any better and are a higher at risk population). It is standard procedure for doctors to give paps starting at age 21 and once you get a pap until 65 it is every three years meaning I am due since I have not had one. I probably would not share this in my complaint though since doctors do differ in opinion and I have the freedom to go to another doctor. My point with that detail is she did not seem to want to do any testing and there is a pattern in her behavior (she does not seem to double check anything - which shocks me because as a nursing student we have been taught we are to triple check EVERYTHING and if we don't we will get in trouble - whether in school or once we graduate.)

A living will is appropriate for any adult, but she did not discuss that with me and the reason why I'm questioning it is because it was right by the other tests that are generally for the older generation. My main point for this detail was that she put information **we did not discuss** and it seems like she does not know which patient she is writing information for. My sister does not have that in her documentation and she is a few years older than me. Also... I know a living will is something smart to have, but my older sisters and everyone that I know in my generation (and one above) that I've asked have never been asked about a living will from their doctors. My parents and grandparents have. Maybe it just happens to be that way for everyone I know or that's what it's like for people around here, I'm not sure.

My main complaint is that she said my potassium is fine without a test as the other patterns she has shown me couldn't stand alone as a viable complaint IMO. If I did report her, should I not mention any of the other things she has done that I believe show her character? I figured it was best to tell the whole story, but of course I would condense everything I wrote on Reddit and make it more professional. 

I would not share any information about my sister on my complaint unless I had it verified from another professional and research. I decided to include all the details in my post to see what other posters thought and I figured it would not hurt to add the info about my sister and Metformin to see if anyone knew anything. 

Metformin is not insulin, but a side effect of Metformin is to lower blood sugar. Based on my research it seems like this is rarely a problem for **healthy** individuals unless certain circumstances are present (e.g. bad diet,  other medications, etc that cause hypoglycemia). <- What I get from that info is hypoglycemia + hypoglycemic = bad. The problem here is my sister has low blood sugar. It sounds like she would maybe be okay, but I think most doctors would not give an oral hypoglycemic (drug that lowers blood sugar) to someone with low blood sugar. I could not find any information regarding Metformin and those with low blood sugar though, so I may not know enough. I'm on reddit right now as my first step, I'm not about to send a complaint tomorrow. 

I appreciate the time you took to read my post and make a response! I hope I did not come off in a negative way. Thank you!"
legaladvice,fczd8vb,t1_fcwmwe5,1578098606.0,"Even if she did pay me the courtesy of assuming I know what I'm talking about, that really is not something a doctor should do. We are all human and I know this point may not be a huge one on its own. However, my whole point of all these details aren't one specific thing or even the specific action, but rather I think it shows the character of the doctor. I will also add that I just started the nursing program (which she knows). When I met her I had not even finished my first semester. Maybe each institution is different and it varies by state... but student nurses are not to be viewed as nurses here. We always have someone over us (a nurse or professor) because we do not know everything and are still learning. So yes, I think it is slightly disturbing that she would give me the courtesy that I know what I'm talking about. Likewise, even if her patient said they were a doctor, should she just do whatever the patient says for medical care (I'm not saying choices, obviously the patient decides, but I'm saying if a patient says I'm a doctor you can give me 500 mg of a drug that you CANNOT give, should the doctor just give it? No!) When I am in the patient and doctor relationship, I should be the patient and she should be the doctor. Likewise, any patient can tell her their credentials, that doesn't mean they're real and that doesn't mean she loses responsibility to be a doctor. It is not a big deal what she has done to me, but I feel like I'm seeing a pattern here. It was okay for me, but what if she believes another patient later without double checking and they get hurt or even killed? That's why I feel like I should maybe report her. Not just for one instance, but her ongoing pattern that she has shown me. 

My sister's documentation was different from mine. Both of ours should have looked alike seeing as neither of us had a mammogram, dexa and etc discussed with us and are basically the same age (besides my sister's extra info like PCOS and hypoglycemia). I had extra information added that did not pertain to me. My point here is not this one detail, but rather that there are multiple issues here which I think show she is either making up info or negligent. It's the little details coming together that I think show isn't a one time mistake, but rather an ongoing lack of care on her part.

Thank you for your reply, I appreciate it! The point of this original post was to see what other people think because I know that I do not know everything. I think I'm not conveying my points well because I see the other people who replied are focusing on specific points rather than my question as a whole of the doctor's character which I believe could be dangerous for patients. Perhaps I am to sensitive and do not know what I'm talking about-- this was why I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask for advice on reddit. I've received it and I appreciate it, I hope I don't come off as defensive. I'm just trying to clarify what I believe needs to be clarified.  I want to have solid ground -- otherwise there wouldn't be a point of reporting it. It seems like the other commenters including you do not believe this, so I am a little more hesitant to report her."
techsupport,eyrnb2h,t1_eymjvku,1567373079.0,"So then if I'm understanding correctly, a wifi extender would slow down the internet for everyone?  Or would it only affect speed on the devices connected to the extender?

My father went ahead and got an extender and we just tried it and unfortunately it did not work. It could be us... haha. However, it was having the same problem as I've had with my phone. We were able to make two networks from the extender and I can ""connect"" to them, but I cannot use the internet. It shows full bars, but no internet is available (even in the same room as the router). We tried setting it up manually and reset it and tried setting it by WPS. 

Anyways, that was just a side note. What's weird is that we were always able to get a connection before on AT&T. I think we've had wireless internet since I was at least 13 and I had used my iPod and iPhone without any problem in my room and throughout the house (the kitchen was the only place it didn't really work). I was even able to go outside and listen to music with the wifi. Since last year it has gotten progressively worse and then it got to a point where we were having the same issues on Spectrum so we decided to switch since 1) we weren't really getting service -- at times no one had a connection 2) it's $20 more expensive with less mbps. 

Spectrum when connected is way faster and better. Sorry, that may not seem to be important because I don't think that information helps now, I'm just trying to state that it did once work so it's a little strange. 

I'm glad you have faith that I could maybe manage it (although I'm struggling to find the model numbers so that might not be a good start). I'm interested in adding another access point through an old router, although I was only able to find an old modem and an old gateway. 

The router model (I think... there's about a million number and letter combinations on my router and no where that says the beautiful clear English word: ""Model"") is  RAC2V1K. I found that on the system info page online and when I googled it, the pictures appear to look like my same model. 

I am not sure if the gateway will work since it's a combo of a router and modem, but its model number is 2701HG-B.

techsupport,eym5svx,t1_eycs3ti,1567200209.0,"I might have been confused with the Double NAT terminology, but if I understood correctly from the website we do not have that problem. There are only two active things plugged in, the modem and router spectrum provided.

How can I run tests by connecting my laptop to the Ethernet cable? Sorry, my internet and wifi knowledge isn't amazing. The router and modem are probably considered pretty far from where the devices trying to connect are. The equipment is in the basement and we try to access internet on the first floor (maybe 8 steps  from the basement) and the third floor (about 4 steps from the second to the third one). It's at the west corner and we're generally trying to access it from the middle/east corner. 

I wanted it upstairs, but the basement is where the only available phone line is and my dad is also the one making the decisions. He said they connected another cable to our house through there so if we were able to connect it upstairs, they would have to come back to install the cable further which would be complicated. My laptop detects about 10 wifi's -- two are ours (5G & 2G). My father said that he is going to get an extender, but now he is saying that it is complicated to find the right one (such as a dual-extender that works for 5G and 2G) so he is doing nothing. I haven't gotten a chance to look because I'm a busy double-major, but not having internet on my phone is starting to make me lose time so I think I will start looking today.  Any advice?

&#x200B;

I've tested it now and it seems to work on all devices when we get closer, so I think it is a proximity issue. Is there anything I can change on my router settings that may help though? Like changing the channel?

&#x200B;

Changing the DNS worked on my phone the first week, but now it makes it disconnect completely (now I'm unable to see the internet name at all). Should I still try to change it on the router settings and see if it works? My understanding is that you can do it manually from a device or set the router that way so you do not have to do it manually on each device. If it is causing problems for my phone's connectivity, I would assume changing the router to the DNS of say [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) or [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) would be the same if I did it manually and not work well with my phone. 

Is the wireless log where I can find the status of if anything is wrong? In my settings I went to Advanced > Status > Wireless.

&#x200B;

I tried removing them from the power strips. It worked for about a minute or two, although I think that's just because I unplugged everything which restarted it. Is it normal for there to be range issues, but it works briefly when you reset everything? I would think there would be another problem then, especially since it shows full bars, but doesn't connect. I thought bars showed the signal strength, so I'm still a little confused. 

&#x200B;

I'm shocked by all the information I was able to get from the  wireless report. Is there any specific information I should look at? 

&#x200B;

I think this would be useful information to share:

The network is disconnected because the user wants to establish a new connection. (6)

The driver disconnected while associating. (4)

The network is disconnected by the driver. (4) 

Unable to identify a user for 802.1X authentication (2).

Some of this info is showing my universities internet connection as well. It says that it failed to connect (if I'm understanding it right), but I've never been disconnected from my school's internet on my laptop. Could that be from my laptop on sleep and me walking around? Unless I always happened to be reading something and it disconnects and reconnects in a second without me knowing... 

Yesterday, I did have issues with my laptop disconnecting multiple times at my house, but it disconnected and then reconnected within a second or so.

techsupport,eycc4dm,t1_eyau0kx,1566999741.0,"I'm answering this one first because later I will try the solutions of the first poster.

As far as I know yes. The ethernet cable is connect to an old computer (probably 10+ years old), so we dont try to get on the internet with it. On my phone, I'm never kicked out of the wireless, the pages just never load or say ""you are not connected to the internet"" even though it shows full bars. The few times my laptop disconnected though, it shows an asterik by the wifi, meaning it went out of it.

The equipment is from them. The wifi seems to work near the router and in the bathroom well (above the router). Something that's weird that I forgot to mention is that once I move from my room to the bathroom, I cannot use 2G. I can only use 5G. 

So, 2G intermittently works in my room (remember I have to reset it to make it work for a little bit and repeat) and then 5G doesnt work at all (says no internet connection when I try to connect). In the bathroom, the 2G has full bars but wont load anything. The 5G will.


Everything is new. Before we had a gateway from AT&T, now we have a modem and a router from Spectrum.

No new electrical equipment.

They both have separate power strips."

We started out giving him around 18-20 hr sleeping time and it worked well the first week, but he has been waking up at night and not tired. We tried playing harder and always had about 2-3 hrs before bedtime playtime so he would tucker out. My sister and her boyfriend (who have the crate in their room -- I actually don't live with them but are helping them out with him) just got tired and so have been having him sleep around 16 hrs a day and he's been sleeping well again.

Actually, besides having to adjust the time he is pretty good in the crate generally. Also, after his nap we had a great playtime! He actually listened to ""release,"" ""settle down"" and ""sit"" for the majority of the time. He ate, drank and used the potty correctly. He bit a couple times at the end of the play sess and wouldn't be redirected nor listen to ""release,"" but putting him in the playpen worked.

I'll tell my sister about upping the nap time. :)"
