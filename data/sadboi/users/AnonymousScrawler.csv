CPTSD,fqygsoa,t3_glh85s,1589748345.0,"Hello, adult survivor of years of overt sexual abuse here.

Communicate with your partner. Start slow, include touching and foreplay that feels safe, and stop if you feel triggered. Trust me, powering through despite being triggered never helps. 

If sexual experiences in general are hard for you, it might help to experience your sexuality on your own for a while (i.e. masturbating) so that you can reconnect sexually with your body while being more in control. You can do this privately, or work it into your sex life with your partner. 

Some situational changes might help? Like place rules around it. Maybe there are certain places on your body you dont want him to touch while having sex that way (i.e. no hip grabbing, no hair pulling, whatever).  Maybe you need to keep the lights on to stay grounded. Maybe it helps if you're in a room that is (or isnt) the bedroom. 

You could also start REALLY slow and just see what it's like for him to touch you from behind. Build up trust and comfort like that before trying penetrative sex. 

Theres lot of options, but they all take trust, communication, and TONS of self-compassion. And an excellent therapist, on my end. And sometimes I still have to stop being intimate for a while. And that just has to be okay. My husband understands. 

I guess I'm just trying to say it gets better!!"

If I got too amped up, I took the mask of and did something soothing. After a bout a week of practice at home I could go to the store.

CPTSD,fpwgj2c,t3_gflljc,1588963053.0,"Whoa, a few thoughts. 

1. You have every right in the world to set boundaries with your brother and with his friend. You are not in a good headspace to being talking this random friend through his PTSD. That's not your responsibility to do. Just because you relate in some ways, that doesnt make you obligated to be his mentor. He likely would benefit from professional help, which you cant provide. In your shoes, I would say something like, ""For personal reasons I am not comfortable discussing these things with you. I want you to be well and get help, but I cant be that support for you.""

2. Your brother may have had good intentions, but you also have a right to adress with him that this made you uncomfortable and for him to not do it in the future. You dont owe him any other explanation, and he doesnt have to like to like it. 

So much of trauma healing is learning how to set appropriate, protective boundaries. These are two excellent opportunities to try.

3. I am 28(f) who has struggled with self-harm since I was 13. I've been with my boyfriend (now husband) for 10 years, and have relapsed probably a dozen times during our relationship. And I have told him every time. It is the worst conversation and he hasn't always handled the information well, but we have gotten better at being able to talk about it. And if you're intimate with your partner, he might find out on his own. Better to have the conversation, in my opinion, than to have him see cuts or new scars with no explanation. It has also helped me resist the urge because I know I can come to my husband when the urge to cut is super strong, and he will understand and help me work through it.

Have you talked openly with him about your history with self-harm before?"

That being said I'm happy to chat back and forth about it all"
CPTSD,fpvz6kp,t3_gfq0z5,1588954451.0,"I read all of this. Its pretty good. A few thoughts that would help clarify things:

The difference between PTSD and CPTSD is prolonged exposure to the trauma. A one-time trauma, which can cause debilitating PTSD, is not the cause of CPTSD. CPTSD is the result of many related or unrelated traumas stack up for a prolonged period of time.

A trauma is considered any situation when you feel real or perceived threat or danger towards yourself or close others. This is important to address because it means a few things. It means that the threat does not actually have to be real; you just have to firmly believe it is. And you do not have to be physically injured to experience CPTSD symptoms; it is enough to just have the constant threat or risk of injury present. Also, real or perceived danger encompasses chronic neglect, abuse of any kind (physical, spiritual, emotional, sexual, verbal), domestic violence, community violence, repeated sexual assault, etc. 

Another difference is that CPTSD is associated primarily with childhood trauma (although not exclusively, as in cases of prolonged adult domestic violence or even war trauma). This is notable because experiencing ongoing trauma as a child SIGNIFICANTLY impacts and alter brains development, which is why the symptoms often persevere and can look different from PTSD. This also explains the disruption of self-image, as children depend on their peers and caregivers to shape their own sense of self-worth, boundary-setting, and autonomy. Additionally, frequent activation of the sympathetic nervous system (""fight or flight"") during childhood can alter growth of the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Children are super vulnerable to this. This means poor emotional regulation, overactive responses to the environment, poor impulse control, etc.

Adults have an already-developed brain, so although traumatic incidences can greatly impact adults, they have a fully developed brain to fall back on..kids dont.

Also if you're going to speak to borderline personality disorder, its worth noting that a borderline diagnosis pretty much always stems from a trauma history, and is closely related to other trauma diagnoses. Theres some key differences, but it makes sense for you to be misdiagnosed as borderline... its a  common diagnoses when we're talking we're trauma. 

Sorry, that was a lot. Hope this helps! I have CPTSD but I always work as a practicing mental health therapist, and children/teens with trauma is my speciality. So I know it from both sides üôÇ

I still feel immense guilt for the pain and worry I caused them, as well as pressure to continue to show them that I'm better now. 

It sounds like you're concerned by your own substance abuse or you wouldn't have brought it up.  I found that being authentic and honest in my healing is always the best choice even when it's the most difficult choice.  And addictions keep us stuck. They prevent us from having to face our trauma and emotions, which prevents healing.  This great future you're building for yourself is at risk if you don't deal with the substance abuse. I'm sure you know that and I'm not saying it to worse in your shame. There's a reason so many people with trauma histories fall into various addictions.

My belief that inner child work was too silly and off-base was basically me trying to intellectualize my way out of my own healing, using my go-to ""I'm too smart to need this"" defense. I couldnt tolerate the idea of offering kindness to my inner child because I hated her, and I avoided confronting my hatred for her by trying to intellectualize my way out of inner-child work. 

That's just me, but it was really helpful to finally understand why inner-child work was so uncomfortable for me. Because, in 10 years of therapy, it was the first time I could admit to myself that I blamed myself for the abuse. And I had to admit to that to work through it.

But yeah, when you're in a traumatic situation your sympathetic nervous system kicks on and your body is flooded with adrenaline and other stress response hormones from your endocrine system. This happens for animals, too, but animals are almost never unable to burn off these hormones because animals in the wild either fight, flee, or die. Being frozen and unable to act on your body's urge to fight or flee is an experience very unique to being human. The stress hormones have to go somewhere. A lot of new research is saying they're absorbed by your fascia, and when you eventually deal with the trauma they are released from the fascia which can cause shaking. Like super intense trembling and shaking."
CPTSD,fhye524,t3_f58pfz,1581974096.0,"Been there. I am in a loving committed relationship with a partner who knows my history and is understanding and patient. But it's still super hard sometimes. 

What helped me was to start exploring my sexuality on my own. I was so closed off to even the idea of feeling aroused or sexual that I had to start super slow... like something as simple as intentionally noticing when I felt aroused in any way, and  feeling my body (not even my sexual parts, just like my stomach and arms) and letting that touch be okay. If I got triggered, I used skills to calm down and noted what about it was triggering. For example, I had to have the lights on in my room and felt too vulnerable lying down, so I would sit up. These things helped reduce my tension. 

 I did trauma therapy with a gifted therapist alongside all of this, although I rarely talked to her about my own self exploration. 

Eventually it just got better. It was like a gradual desensitization over years. At this point I can masturbate without being triggered like 75% of the time. And if I'm triggered, it's more manageable. And I have a pretty healthy sex life with my husband. There are times when its harder, but its manageable.

But the self exploration is most useful if you're super mindful about being connected to your body and kind to yourself. I'd stay away from porn or material that would help you masturbate while remaining disconnected. Also some people with sexual trauma histories get really into hardcore stuff that reminds them of their trauma...  and that can had negative impacts on your healing.

CPTSD,fhyc0jw,t3_f5cbpd,1581972843.0,"I shake sometimes. I've actually read that it is a natural byproduct of your body releasing some of the repressed tension and terror from the physical trauma. If you like podcasts, the Mental Illness Happy Hour actually has an episode that addresses this... I'm happy to share the link if you want. 

The premise is that when you feel terror and are unable to get away, your body produces stress hormones that have nowhere to go. Fighting or fleeing would naturally burn off these hormones, but if you're unable to do either, your fascia and muscles absorb the stress hormones. When you reprocess the trauma down the road, the shaking is your body finally releasing and processing the stress hormones that were produced during the trauma. I know it sounds outlandish if you're unfamiliar with this stuff, but it seems to be true. That's why exercise and physical stuff is so important in trauma healing."

It sounds like you're in the beginning parts of your trauma healing journey. The way you feel now will pass, with hard work and help. 

It feels really overwhelming to be able to take a step back and realize how messed up things were, especially when abuse/neglect/dysfunction was normalized in your home. But being able to acknowledge the big picture of your trauma is so so so important. And it's a good sign that you're doing so. 

It was not your fault and you didnt deserve it. We are taught to blame ourselves, and children also naturally blame themselves. But it wasn't your fault.

CPTSD,fhluh2c,t3_f3f8g8,1581704832.0,"I've actually been discussing my inner critic A LOT in therapy recently, after my therapist pointed out how often my inner critic comes out. I cant remember a time in my life where I wasnt highly critical of myself. The salience of my inner critic absolutely means that it served me a purpose. 

The conclusion I've reached is that my inner critic helped me feel safe. I blamed myself for the abuse I experienced, and my inner critic fed into my belief that if I could be just perfect enough my father would stop hurting me. My inner critic kept me locked in a pattern of holding myself responsible for my abuse and then helping me believe that I was in control of ending the abuse by being just perfect enough. My inner critic gave me both a sense of control and a feeling of hope. 

Ultimately, the purpose this served was sparing me from having to face the fact that I was completely powerless to effect what was happening to me. There was no rhyme or reason to when,  why, or how badly I would be abused, but children arent equipped to live in that kind of chaos. Blaming myself made me feel in control of my abuse, which let me buy into the belief that I could keep myself safe. My inner critic told me that he hurt me because I wasnt good enough, but that once I finally was good enough, he would stop. It was magical thinking, and it completely dominated my inner world. But it gave me a false sense control and hope, and I desperately needed both those things. 

Blaming myself also spared me the absolutely devastating pain and grief of coming to terms with the fact that my father was choosing to hurt me. The grief I've faced accepting that he was not equipped to love and care for me has been a brutal letting-go process. 

So, in sum, my inner critic helped me feel safe and in control, and also kept me from having to face the painful reality of my abuse. It helped me feel powerful and shielded me from my pain and grief. 

Of course it also led to an eating disorder and compulsiveness and self-harm, because I hated myself for never being good enough and because I had firmly convinced myself that the abuse was my fault. That's where my inner critic failed me.... it caused me constant, inescapable shame.."

Realizing how my trauma influenced my ED is what ultimately helped me overcome my ED. It's a huge, important step. 

When I exercise and feel like its triggering my ED stuff, I remind myself that I am exercising to be strong and to take care of my body... that after so many years of being abused, caring for my body is a reparative act. Nurturing my body and growing strong is taking care of myself in a way that wasnt offered to me as a child, and that is healing. 

I am also super careful. I dont diet. I cover the calorie counter if I do cardio. And I am hyper aware of the fact that my ED stuff gets triggered whenever my sexual abuse stuff is triggered. If I'm deep in trauma work, I am extra cautious about body image stuff because that's when I'm lost vulnerable to engaging in old ED habits."

And she is reacting in hostile ways because she is triggered and struggling.

Doubting your own abuse is often a symptom of abuse. Abusers use manipulative tactics to make their victim feel crazy, so the victim is easier to control. Your doubt and feeling crazy is probably a strong testament that the abuse did happen as you remember it.

I am also in the mental health field and incredibly well-versed in trauma. I find that my clinical experience and knowledge makes my own personal trauma work feel harder, because I get so frustrated with myself. Logically knowing about trauma doesnt translate to my own trauma healing in the ways I want it to, and it pisses me off. When I get super frustrated I remind myself that I was a child when the trauma occurred, and trauma is developmental; as a child, I didnt have the knowledge about trauma that I now have, and it is still my child self that is so wounded. So of course what I now know about trauma doesnt perfectly translate to my own trauma healing.

CPTSD,fhi91hk,t3_f3eb2k,1581620066.0,"I really relate to this post. One thing that has helped in, in the past is to remove myself from the equation and instead take an analytical approach and look at my SYMPTOMS. Instead of relying on my memories of what happened or how I feel about it as ""evidence"" that it was or wasn't ""that bad"", to instead look at my symptoms as definitive proof of what happened. 

If what happened was significant enough to cause the slew of trauma symptoms I experience, my brain was undeniably impacted by the trauma. There is no room for ""maybe it wasnt bad enough"" because my trauma symptoms prove that it was. Your autonomic nervous system responds to the stimulus, and it the stimulus (i.e. trauma) left me with all these symptoms than it was ""bad enough"" to traumatize me. No argument there. 

Of course ideally I will eventually be able to connect my emotions to my trauma and validate myself, but when I get caught beating myself up because ""it wasnt that bad"", stepping back and looking at the symptoms and behaviors I experience as a direct result of the trauma helps me quantify my experiences without as much shame. 

For example, I have flashbacks, nightmares, and I dissociate at the drop of a hat. These are all textbook symptoms of trauma that I didnt choose, and they are proof that it was ""bad enough"" to cause them."

Therapy sessions loose their effectiveness in these type or arrangements.

Wanting to talk through some of the info from session with your partner is one thing, but putting pressure on each other to report back is another entirely different thing and a little codependent.

CPTSD,feeumee,t3_eosjva,1579041565.0,"I dallied in disordered eating for three years in high school. I counted calories, severely restricted my eating, exercised compulsively, and made myself vomit.

I also cut myself, and my cutting and eating were interwoven in this terrible fucked up way. 

I've been mostly free of ED symptoms for about ten years, now. I still struggle with using food for comfort, and I cant diet (I will never be able to diet without getting compulsive). Body image is a struggle, but I better understand now that my body image has more to do with control and my abuse tha  it does with my physical appearance.  

Understanding how my trauma and eating habits were related is what helped me recover. And a damn good therapist. I found that the restricting accomplished different things for me than the purging, which was useful insight. 

95% of the time, I can eat without guilt or shame. I eat what I want, when I'm hungry. I dont obsess over my weight or count calories or binge/purge. I can exercise in healthy, non-obsessuve ways. But I consider it like alcoholism in that I will always be in ED recovery. I cannot allow myself to diet or pay attention to calories (on food or when exercising). I am very careful about how often I weigh myself.

He has stood by me as I've done various parts of my trauma work. Even when he doesnt understand or cant relate, he asks me what I need and he follows through. I was sexually abused, so our sex life can be challenging. He is always kind and understanding when intimacy is hard for me. He knows how to support me when I'm anxious, when I'm scared, when I'm dissociated, when I'm down on myself.

I decided to talk to her about it at our next therapy session. She suggested that because I was abused by someone I deeply trusted and cared for, maybe dreaming of other people I trust hurting me in a similar way is my brains way of trying to process my ability to assess when someone is trustworthy or not, whether or not I can trust myself to trust others, etc. Also it is a way of processing the grief and pain I feel over my initial abuse, being transferred onto other perceived caregivers. Whether i dream of my husband, mother, or therapist abusing me, the core of the dream is someone I'm supposed to trust, who is supposed to keep me safe, hurting me.

Generally, I think if the memory returns in a flashback, it probably happened. False memories can occur, but they arent usually created and stored in the brain in a way that would lead to a flashback. Flashbacks are the real deal and a pretty solid indication that it occurred. 

That being said, even if the memory is not real, the fact that you believe it could be is worth exploring and validating. Lots of times folks feel shame if they dont think the memory is legit, but just believing it could be usually indicates some difficult stuff about how they felt as a child.

CPTSD,fdrbp5j,t3_emungq,1578682172.0,"Borderline seems to be caused by extreme trauma, just like CPTSD. There are absolutely similarities. And it is common for folks with extreme trauma to be misdiagnosed as having bipolar disorder. I think your therapist is right, sometimes treating the symptoms and healing is more important that the diagnostic label. 

But there are diagnostic differences between CPTSD and borderline personality disorder (BPD) when it comes to symptoms. In my opinion, the biggest difference is that folks with BPD often have a disrupted sense of self... they dont have a clear core idea of who they are as a person to come back to when upset. If you ask someone with full BPD to describe who they are as a person, it would be challenging for them, and very based on how they felt in the moment. This lack of a firm sense of self leads to lots of dysregulation and difficulties in mood management and interpersonal skills. Since they struggle to check in with their core self, it is really challenging for them to identify what they need moment to moment, and to meet these needs in healthy ways. 

While peeps with CPTSD also struggle with self-image, its not quite in the same way. They might have deeply wounded parts of themselves, and a distorted self image, but they can usually still identify a core Self. Their ego is a bit more in-tact.
