1. Could be better, could be much worse.
2. I am living alone with my cat.
3. Dark green, there is probably a word for it but I am a simple guy, so I have no idea.
4. Why not both? I live in a small studio apartment, but I would definietly have a dog alongside my cat, if I lived in a fenced house.
5. A little bit miserable, my mother is a nurse and she works with COVID patients so I am worried.
6. Not much has changed in my everyday life, since I have always been a loner, my work hours have been severly cut, it is tough but a lot of others have it much worse.
7. Digital sessions all the way! I have the social aptitude of a handful of dead butterflies, the less I interact with people personally, the less I embarass myself.
8. [https://www.youtube.com/user/TheWolfePit](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheWolfePit) This dude cooks and reviews horrible frozed ready to eat meals, I don't know what I find so addicting in the latter.

10. My go to snack is chewing gums.
11. It has been more than 3 months, since I had a beer with my friends, I am not a party animal, but I am really starting to miss a good night out in the town.
12. Xcom EW with long war mod right now, also new Xcom spinoff is releasing withing a week, so I am excited about it, I love the series.
13. I don't watch anything currently.
14. Learbed how to cook minute rice in 57 seconds.
15. Xcom Chimera Squad wohooo!!! I am on my way snek waifu!!!
16. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDNXVHvo-yM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDNXVHvo-yM)

18. Same answer as to 1. Could be better, could be much worse.
19. Gaming is my lifeblood, especially nowadays.
20. I am REALLY hoping, that underpaid healthcare workers like my mother, will recieve better treatment from society, than they do nowadays.
21. Did I mention Xcom: Chimera Squad? The remaining funds would be spent on some incredibly embarassing hentai game, that I would try to hide from my library after playing it."

Stealth is key in an all out battle royale, so I would definietly go with a pokemon, which can turn invisible. It has been ages since I last watched the anime, but I remember Haunter was able to turn invisible, he could just go invisible at the beginning of the match and wait in the sidelines until only one other opponent left, then he can ambush the other one, who is probably exhausted, and take an easy and really scummy win."

My absolute favorite game is really hard to pick, since I have a lot, but one of the most influental game I ever played was Xcom: Enemy Unknown and Xcom 2. Enemy Unknown was my first ever Xcom game, in introduced me to the franchise and cemented my love for turn based tactical games. Xcom 2 basically is an improved version of enemy unknown and it basically fixed my only problem with the game, it has semi random maps now so replayability is ensured. I also played the old Xcom games since then and loved it (but holy hell terror from the deep is HARD). Btw if you are by chance also an Xcom fan, check out Xenonauts, it is an Xcom clone but an actually good one.

I want Synthetik: Legion Rising mainly because it is a roguelike, the combat system looks fun and tactically deep, and a famous african warlord gave it his recommendation, so that is gold to me (hey hey people)"

3:  S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky

5:  Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide

I would love the Stalker franchise, because I purchased Escape from Tarkov half a year ago and had incredible fun with it. Many people told me that the game is incredibly similar to the Stalker games, just without the multiplayer part, and told me that based on my enjoyment of Tarkov, I would probably love any of the Stalker games. They also told me that I should definietly check out mods for them, because it makes the games even better. Watched the trailers on stream and the game indeed looked fun, looks like it has a sci fi twist in it unlike Tarkov, definietly piqued my interest

I am interested in Vermintide, because I am an avid blood bowl fan, which is basically a board game that is taking place in the same universe as Warhammer, I would love to play a non goofy game in the same universe and immerse myself in the lore (people say it is vast) Also read that it is a melee fighting game with a focus on coop, I played a lot of Chivalry: medieval warfare, and more recently, getting my arse kicked in Mordhau, so I am always interested in melee games.

My favorite game is Kingdom Come: Deliverance, It is a historically accurate open world RPG without (thankfully) any fantasy element, you also play as a good for nothing peasant, since you are a common blacksmith, you suck at swordfight, archery, heck, you can't even read at the beginning of the game, every time you level up, you become slightly better and it feels amazing to see Henry slowly become better and better at doing everything. The combat is also excellent and harsh (playing the game on hardcore is a must IMO) you WILL get your arse kicked at the beginning, and being outnumbered is almost a certain death sentence.

All in all, if you like open world RPGs and tired of the fantasy tropes, Kingdom Come will not disappoint you

Favorite villain have to be nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest, the fate of McMurphy at the end of the movie is one of the most horrible state a human can end up in IMO.

I was about 8 years old on a cruise with my family, my father repeatedly told me not to flail my legs over the rails because I will lose my sandals, I ignored his warnings every time and just as he said, promtly managed to lose my sandals to the sea within 10 minutes.

The fun truly began when the ship docked at a small, almost uninhabited island for some free time, the island only had trails made out of pebbles for tourists to follow, and it hurt like hell to walk on. After a couple of minutes my father couldn't bear to listen to my whining any longer and gave his sandals to me and proceeded to spend the rest of our time on the island walking on the pebbles bare footed, cursing and getting laughed at by the other tourists and my family.

Almost 20 years have passed since then and my family still brings up this story every summer when I go meet them."
