We’re certainly not unified enough for such a task yet. And yet people think China and the US are different. They seem to be getting more and more similar by the day. 

But that’s just how I see it. An “essential” worker. Who’s getting paid a salary (the average of what i made before) now because they don’t want to give us raises. The people seem very sacrificial right now, and yet it seems that so many are very willing to sacrifice themselves. Does trump get elected for another 4 years? We all say no, but some dread deep down makes me think he will be re elected and then re elected again after those 4 years. See where I’m going with this? I hope I’m wrong. I really do."

Shooter is an ex cop. this person sworn to uphold the law. How can someone who is supposed to trust the system, take justice into their own hands, breaking the system of prosecution they were sworn to uphold? People will argue that we need stricter background checks for owning firearms. But the system for that has failed in this instance. This was an ex cop. Someone who has, probably, the best background there is for buying a gun. The hard truth is that we can’t predict what people will do. What their mental state will be even a day from now. People can snap in an instant. Make poor decision or make great decisions. One could argue that if the man jogging had a gun he could’ve defended himself, wouldn’t that just be anarchy if everyone had a gun and used it so freely like this? One could argue that guns should be outlawed, but then that breaks constitutional rights? Maybe a “rent a gun” for hunting only allowed. 

For me, owning a gun for home defense is like owning a fire extinguisher. You hope you never have to use it, but having it could mean the difference for me and my family. Owning a gun for hunting is different. Using that tool for anything other than to hunt would be wrong. Personally, I cannot understand anyone who picks up a gun and can wield it so casually. There is a certain respect that should be given to the tool in your hands. A power not to be taken lightly. It’s not a nerf blaster, it’s not a trigger on a console controller. When you pull that trigger, there is a consequence. Good or bad. Guns shouldn’t be feared, but respected. Like getting behind the wheel of a car. I’m not afraid to drive, but I understand that it’s entirely possible for tragedy to occur by my negligence. Anyone who can pick up a gun and not have respect for it or show any restraint should not have a gun."
