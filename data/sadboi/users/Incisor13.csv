They dont have any obligation to move along and YOU have no idea as to whether or not the OP attacks people who do anal, except for a single opinion post in a sub DEDICATED to unpopular opinions. Why dont you take your own advice and since you dont like this post, MOVE ALONG BRO."

I can't believe people are actually applauding CA for doing what they were supposed to do anyway."
