It’s all about perspective. Do you look at these downs as an impenetrable barrier blocking you from your happiness? Or do you look at these downs as an opportunity to overcome, improve, and learn. Ik it’s super cheesy and cliche but it’s true; a negative mindset will only worsen your situation. It’s much easier said then done but if you just give up and let yourself fall, how do you ever expect to reach the top?"
helpme,fedees4,t3_eoi8d1,1579009225.0,Wow! Sounds like a packed schedule. Since it seems like you don’t have much free time I’d say start getting into doing some meditation. Just 10-15 of you time where you can relax and destress a little. And you can always do that on a whim!
helpme,fe57rqi,t1_fe56t8p,1578866348.0,"Then I’d say to get out of your coworker setting because I’m not gonna lie at this point it’s gonna be a lot harder to integrate intk that circle then start from scratch elsewhere. If you play sports join a rec team, there may be something at your local gym. Maybe talk to old friends you haven’t talked to in a while, idk man it just seems like a change in scenery could really do you some good"
helpme,fe4puh5,t3_enkb87,1578861697.0,"Dude I feel you 100% I’m on the contrary in that I’m very social but I don’t really have close friends that I can rely on or talk to or have fun with outside of a school setting. I have a cat though and he really makes me happy and lightens me up just by being around me, if you find that getting to know people or connecting to them is too hard, I’d say get an animal if you can afford to keep one. Something that can roam around the house would be best like a dog or a cat. Don’t feel bad about your co workers though. Fuck then. They suck for that. Try making new friends like going to a bar or a comedy show or join a club with people who harbor the same interests as you. And you may find a few people you really click with. You don’t need a ton of friends. Just a small handful of badass people and y’all can conquer the world"
helpme,fdgu9t3,t3_ekztws,1578408480.0,"As a fellow teen who has spent many days and weeks home alone I personally feel that’s it’s ok. But if you think there is a better option for you to go or if you think you’re gonna do something dangerous while unsupervised id say to find somewhere to crash, let it be a friends house or your grandparents. Use your best judgment and take care of yourself ❤️"
