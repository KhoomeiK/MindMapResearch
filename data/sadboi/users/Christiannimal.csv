One of the points it claims is most of your vegetables are pollinated with this species and wild bees do the rest.  One of the reasons we are losing our native bees is due to mass bee farming industries.  I know several bee keepers and some of them go through a couple colonies each year.  Sometimes the colony just rejects the queen and flies off.  Another statement they claim is part of the decline is from losing their habitats, they have no natural habitat here(aside from the wild escapees), just farms.  That said, this post was in regards to ‚Äúmurder wasp‚Äù and contributing to the decline of honeybees, which is silly.  

Native bees include orchard bees, solitary bees, bumblebees, squash bees, carpenter bees.  There is a very real threat to these natural native species.  There‚Äôs some great entomology groups out there that have more knowledge than I if you want to learn more."

AmItheAsshole,fgh8qyc,t3_eyfzw2,1580779325.0,"NTA

Agree that it should be combined decision-making between you two, but here are a few of my thoughts.  

She doesn‚Äôt have to do skin to skin contact, you can!   Both my husband and I did skin to skin.  It will benefit your baby and maybe she‚Äôll come around.   

I will always sing the praises of breastfeeding, but if she‚Äôs final on that decision, trying to convince her otherwise might come off as unsupportive.  I would talk with her about at least breastfeeding the first week or two so baby can have all the amazing health/medicinal benefits of colostrum.  

Breastfeeding brings me to the last one.  I‚Äôm confused why the placenta, because eating it will increase her milk supply (I consumed mine in capsule-form after my kids).  I‚Äôm also wondering what negative effects you‚Äôve heard regarding the practice.  

Either way, let her know you‚Äôre supportive, she‚Äôs filled with hormones, and it may seem to her that you are challenging her and she will probably double down on defying you."
