When I was 3 I started having dreams that I was a boy and it felt so natural and normal. I knew then that I was trans, but had no language to express myself. I ended up repressing those thoughts until I was 19 when I knew I was hiding something from myself, but made a conscious decision not to find out what it was because I didn't think I was ready. At 26 I finally came out as trans and started transitioning. 

I think the take away here is that by supporting your kiddo in whatever decision they make you're giving them a huge leg up. They will never have to pretend they're someone they're not because they feel safe around you. Follow their lead, and stay supportive. You got this!"

So I guess my advice is to stop giving away your precious fucks. You're an incredible human and more people admire you than you think."
