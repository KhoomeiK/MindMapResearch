AmItheAsshole,fps984x,t3_gf4knq,1588869592.0,"NTA. I was put in a very similar situation when I was about 10. Without going into too much detail, my adopted sister was 17 and pregnant when my parents took her in. We shared a cramped attic room, and she stole my things constantly. My mom and step-dad always took her side, no matter what. My step-sister stopped visiting because she felt uncomfortable around our new ""sister"", and because of that, I was robbed of a relationship with a sister that I actually loved. I understand that adopted kids deserve love and concern, but you still deserve it too. I cannot stress this enough; make yourself heard. I'm currently suffering from several mental disorders (Borderline personality disorder, Major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, etc.) that are heavily rooted in childhood trauma. I have a massive fear of being abandoned or forgotten, and I have bursts of anger and suicidal tendencies because of the way that everything was handled in my situation. You do NOT deserve to go through this. PLEASE make yourself heard. I'm here if you need support."

So, I usually use a box mix of couscous, the brand is Far East. You could probably make a similar one from scratch, but I think it's easier to just use the boxed stuff.

Ingredients:

For tofu:

â€¢14oz block of extra firm tofu, pressed at least 15 min
â€¢1 tbsp sesame oil, or your favorite kind of oil to use
â€¢1 tsp tamari, or soy sauce 
â€¢1/2 tsp garlic powder
â€¢1/4 tsp rice wine vinegar 
â€¢1/4 tsp maple syrup or clover honey (any sweet syrup you have on hand will work!)
â€¢2 tsp cornstarch or rice flour

For Asparagus

â€¢1 bunch of asparagus
â€¢2 tbsp butter
â€¢Juice of 1/2 lemon (about an ounce) 
â€¢1 tsp onion powder
â€¢1tbsp grated Parmesan, or more to taste.


Tofu: Pre-heat oven to 400Â°F. Cut tofu into 1/2 in cubes and pat dry. In a medium bowl, whisk sesame oil, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, syrup, and garlic powder until homogenous. Coat the tofu in the bowl using a rubber spatula to gently turn the cubes until completely coated. Sprinkle in 1 tsp cornstarch and stir until coated. Sprinkle in remaining cornstarch and mix until no powder can be seen. Spread the tofu carefully onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Bake for 25-30 minutes, stirring twice during cooking (I usually stir once every 10 minutes). I recommend salting the tofu when it comes out of the oven for a bit of highlight to the flavor, but that's optional. 

When the tofu has about 10 minutes left, I would recommend starting the asparagus if you're going to make them together. The couscous I mentioned only takes about 5 minutes, so you could start that around the same time if you're making it all together (which I highly recommend bc this is literally the best vegetarian dish I've ever come up with)

Asparagus: Using a large knife, cut the asparagus into 1 1/2 inch pieces, discarding the tough bottom parts. In a medium skillet, melt your butter over high heat. Once melted, add the asparagus. Stir with a spatula to coat in butter. Continue to stir every 30 seconds or so for 3 minutes. Add lemon juice and onion powder at this point, and reduce heat to medium-high. Stir occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and add parmesan, tossing lightly. Salt and pepper to taste. 

When plating, I usually put the couscous on the bottom, asparagus on top of that, and tofu on the top of that. Drizzle with tahini or top with Lao Gan Ma (hot chili crisp). You can also top it with parmesan if you'd like. Should make 3-4 servings!"
vegetarianrecipes,fml4nw5,t3_fvt2jg,1586178506.0,"Crispy tofu is my favorite thing to make, and it's so much easier than you'd think. Usually, I serve ours up on top of parmesan couscous and pan-seared asparagus, topped with spicy chili crisp, or just some tahini or something. HMU if you want the recipe I usually use!

AskReddit,fkzbn35,t3_fl944n,1584667241.0,"When I was about 15 or 16, my parents paid their friend to divide the attic of their house into two rooms. I used to have the whole attic as my bedroom (it's a really small house, originally 2br1b) but they decided to convert the second room into a small area for them to keep their hobbies. 

Their friend created the wall by making a sort of wooden frame and screwing drywall onto one side, which ended up being the side for the new room instead of the side for mine. He then installed two wall lights, leaving me with some wires dangling right next to my desk. I know nothing about electrician's work, and decide it's safe to hang a shoe organizer (I used it for light craft supplies like buttons and embroidery floss) from some of the wires, like a complete genius.

One time, I was on a Skype call with my ex-girlfriend. I was messing with the shoe organizer and ended up disconnecting some sort of wire. It knocked out the power to the one light that was hooked up on that side in the other room, so in a complete stroke of genius, I tried to fix it. I realized that one of the wires was exposed, and was supposed to be nestled down in this cute little orange cap with another partially exposed wire. So, I shoved that wire down in there, which caused a huge spark that potentially could have burned down my house. This shorted out the entire attic and left me without electricity for most of my spring break, since my parents are major DIY enthusiasts who refuse to pay for anything they remotely believe they can do by themselves, which isn't much.

I never told anyone what caused the short, but it was a super scary moment for me."

I haven't had a dream about him in almost ten years, but I think that may have been a manifestation of my desire to be the center of someone's attention, instead of being put on the back burner, like my parents and family always seemed to do. 

Dreams are so interesting, and that might be the reason why I try so hard to lucid dream whenever I can. It feels like a sort of escape, but one in which I'm anchored enough to not lose myself, if that makes sense?"

I'm an AFAB non-binary person, and I struggle with my self image SO hard. 

I've always been overweight, so Ive had self-hatred ingrained from a young age. I remember an episode I had last August during an acid trip, where I began to compulsively work out for hours, only stopping to purge. Struggling with gender on top of body image is difficult, especially in a plus size body that looks STRICTLY feminine (wide hips, DDD breasts that are impossible to bind, big thighs, curves everywhere, you get it) After that day, I could barely look at myself for almost a month. I was constantly high because it was the only cushioning between self-harm and me. This version of myself feels as if it's always lurking, and I fall into that mentality at least a few times a week.

On the other hand, there are days where I can't stop looking at my face because I think I'm the ideal of beauty. Usually, these are days that I spend hours on my makeup. These are days that I have this massive confidence that feels unbreakable. I'll wear cute clothes that compliment my shape, I'll do my hair in ways that I don't usually do it, and I almost gain some sort of God complex, which is scary in itself.

Since my diagnosis, these extremes feel a bit more explained. I've learned that I can at least make a mock confidence for myself if I wear makeup. I know it sounds shitty, but at least then I can look people in the eyes when they talk to me and not feel like Frankenstein's monster. I think that this might be my biggest symptom, if I'm being real."

BPD,fi0mbse,t3_f5rwea,1582040206.0,"I was the only child of my mom's first marriage. After their messy divorce, my mom married my stepdad, who had a daughter a few years older than me. They constantly gushed about her accomplishments, catered to her every picky request, etc. She didn't live in the same house as me, but she was over every other weekend, holidays, and sometimes school breaks. 

My mom desperately wanted to have a child with her new husband, but she was never able to. She ended up adopting a seventeen year old girl that loved across the street from us for a majority of my life. She was pregnant, and due to her mom's abusive nature, my mom had a ""God's plan"" moment where she decided to help by legally adopting her.

She had her baby when I was ten years old. My step-sister stopped visiting because this girl and her situation made her uncomfortable, and tbh me too. Obviously, her and the baby became the main focus of everything since new life was all my mom wanted. I slipped from being a ""gifted"" student into a majorly depressed self-harming nightmare. I had physical fights with this girl who was legally my sister, and was ALWAYS somehow out into the wrong whenever a fight or argument transpired. I eventually became someone who never interacted with anyone unless necessary. 

Eleven years later, I'm 21, living with my fiancÃ©, going to college for my English degree, and actually beginning to figure out my mental state very slowly. Every time I call my mom, she only wants to talk about my sister and my nephew, who she was granted custody of after his mother abandoned him at four years old. My sister gets supervised visitation, is living with her birth mother again, and is 28 years old with no car and no job.  

Sibling relationships effect the hell out of people. I'm fairly confident that my mental state would have never gotten this bad if I had been enough, or even shown that I was loved after all of this happened. It was draining to live in that house. I left at seventeen, and I don't visit anymore unless it's obligatory, part of the reason being how many suicide attempts I had there. 

Parents can be shit, and I'm sorry."

AmItheAsshole,ff7j43p,t3_erwpm1,1579650753.0,"Absolutely NTA. Children are the best measure of telling if something is delicious or not, simply because they have more taste buds. You can't help that your neice enjoys the food she is given when she's with you, that's just how kids are. And she's not really old enough to understand why her parents have the quality of food that they do. Kids know wants, and wants are expressed. Not her fault.

You are simply feeding the child you're watching (for FREE) in the most convenient and gracious way you can. You should not feel bad. They are in the wrong for even addressing it."
AmItheAsshole,ff705zc,t3_ertvg6,1579638476.0,"Obviously NTA. I think you did something beneficial here, OP."
AmItheAsshole,ff6zlaa,t3_ervv4n,1579638141.0,"ESH. You are digging your own grave with both your step son and husband by refusing to let him stay for the summer. That will cause permanent damage to your marriage and any future relationship with your stepson, as well as your husband's relationship with his son. Obviously the kid's an ass for what he's done, but as an adult woman, you need to understand that he has barely begun his life, and is now entering a very rough time in which parental support is crucial. This is a huge crossroad that you've found yourself at. For lack of a better term, I think that being the bigger person would be beneficial. Who knows? Maybe things will be different now. And if they aren't, you can take appropriate action then. As a person who was raised as a product of a failed marriage, I would give anything to take away the harsh things I said to my stepdad as a shitty little teenager."
