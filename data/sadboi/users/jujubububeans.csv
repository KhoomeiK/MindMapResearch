bipolar2,f8lhkng,t3_e0zteg,1574622262.0,I struggle with it and it made my bf break up with me.... I would have outbursts on him... I miss him so much. He was the sweetest man I‚Äôve ever dated and supported me in any way he could. But I couldn‚Äôt control my anger and the last time I unleashed he said he couldn‚Äôt do it anymore... I think daily on how to control this so I don‚Äôt loose the love of my life again

spirituality,f8fvgli,t1_f8ffzps,1574549939.0,"Hey! I was wondering, for some time insects were always coming to me. And they scare me. Also my whole life spiders have usually always been around me and they REALLY scare me. But so- about year ago I was in a very abusive relationship. We were at the beach and I felt something in my bra, I slapped my back then reached into my bra. I held in my hand a bee. Freaked out I threw it. Then after calming down I went to go see the bee and made sure it was ok. It was just hanging out. I was so happy and grateful it didn‚Äôt sting me. Then around a month after that (broken up with the abuser but they were still emotionally around and stalking me) I worked in a completely different state- Kansas- for short term job. I would sometimes see these tiny black beetles on the ground when I smoked my night cigarette. Then one night there was a swarm of them out of no where, I am with a group of people outside, yet they are all over me. Climbing up my legs, in my shirt, in my hair. And on no one else. One of the people say watch out those bite, yet none of them bit me. I had to go inside because I was getting too freaked out while everyone else was fine."

bipolar2,f8f2kar,t1_f8f0av3,1574537504.0,"It can get better. And it can always get worse... I honestly don‚Äôt know what to say because when I didn‚Äôt want to live no words could save me. I didn‚Äôt think that killing myself was murder, it was my ultimate relief. My whole life I wanted to die. I am 30 now, with 2 suicide attempts. Everyday I do something for self love. Could be as small as putting on socks... socks are great. Or drinking some water, isn‚Äôt water awesome? Maybe you can sit outside in the sun- vitamin D is so important for moods and it‚Äôs free as long as the suns out. Just choose to do one thing no matter how small it is everyday and then you will have some kind of accomplishment even though you don‚Äôt want to live. And that‚Äôs, like wow!! You did that even though you are going through the unimaginable/ through what most people can‚Äôt even comprehend. Also- I found my purpose. My purpose and goals is to make sure I am healed and to not kill myself. Then I can be a healer to others. I‚Äôm working everyday on my first goal. Everything I just said could mean nothing to you, but at least you have eyes to read and you read this for a couple of seconds and maybe felt 0.0000000001% better. I hope so... love yourself. Don‚Äôt do harm to yourself. If you want love, like most of us, give it to yourself. You are your own soul mate."

I love animals so much and they are better to be around than humans in my opinion. I know that nothing will compare to your ex tho.... have a journal and write in it how much you love yourself, how smart and caring you are, and how you are your favorite person. Write the things you would want a partner to tell you, because these are the things that you can give yourself. I know some days will be too hard... but keep the journaling daily/ throughout the day/ as much as you need/ to get out of your head and try to love yourself. I hope this helps and doesn‚Äôt fuxk up more of your shit.... I‚Äôm struggling with losing the love of my life as well.... and trying very hard to love myself so I don‚Äôt fall off the earth.

Everything was going wrong and my emotions wreaked havoic on my organs. I got very sick which led to bronchitis which led to two fractured ribs... which then led to the love of my life breaking up with me. The break up drove me into hypomania and I became a better person. Of course I Became a better person in hopes for my bf to come back but also I‚Äôve finally realized I need to do it for myself if I ever want to be in a relationship. And the first relationship that is most important is the relationship with myself. I never loved myself my entire life. Since I was born I didn‚Äôt want to live. I disassociated until I was around 7 then after that just accepted I had to live for the time being. I‚Äôm 30 now, and I actually love myself, tell myself how much I love me and write in a journal everyday. But after 1 month and half my hypomania is dwindling... I didn‚Äôt get out of bed yesterday or today... the thoughts of my exboyfriend are getting too much... the pain from the last straw of my love leaving me while I was already so broken hyperdrived me into beautiful hypomania.
