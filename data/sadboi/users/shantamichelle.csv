If emotions are so incredibly easy, why are there so many emotionally stunted people? Manifesting something into my reality based purely on emotion seems like a horrible idea. Logical and reason should be behind your manifestations, not wavering emotions. Your emotions should only be used as a gauge to see whether or not you’re in the right place to receive, but not used as the basis for your manifestations.

I shared that I read tarot and follow astrology as preface to this dilemma of attraction. In tarot and astrology alike, I’ve been given green lights to start putting things into motion. I’ve just gotten out of a dormant period of more inward work and healing. That would not have been the best time to make plans or moves. I can try to attract the things I desire everyday but if I’m not ready for them, it would be a waste. To try to attract more business or a solid foundation for a new business when my headspace is clouded would’ve been stressful and I likely would’ve dropped the ball that I spent time asking for. I’m a firm believer in “what you put out is what you get back” so if, energetically, I’m asking the Universe to deliver things that I’m not equipped to handle, then it’s a bit of a moot point. Thus why I’m here. If I feel ready and prepared, if my intentions and focus are clear in what I want, why would this road block come into play? That was the important part of the question, not my “fleas”."

energy_work,fb0btu8,t3_eax4az,1576424593.0,Start with Gratefulness. Everything else will fall into place.
lawofattraction,fb0bmvr,t1_fazyd2r,1576424525.0,Exactly. Complaining in order to communicate dissatisfaction is fine. Bottling it up usually puts the thought on loop and then it becomes a manifestation. Excessive communication is usually a sign of a lack of Gratefulness. That in itself is a blockage.
lawofattraction,fay1agy,t1_faw6gp1,1576393247.0,"This. Someone once compared a relationship with money to a relationship with a person. “If that person is clingy and obsessive, you wouldn’t want to be around them. And, on the flipped side of that coin, if the person just seemed to not care about you at all, you wouldn’t want to be around them. But in a good, healthy relationship, there is caring but there is also space to come and go freely. You have to see money the same way.” That really stuck with me. It makes so much sense."
lawofattraction,fay0qt5,t1_fav1la5,1576393003.0,"Okay, here we go!

The first place I suggest starting is with Gratefulness. Everyday, I write down ten things I’m grateful for- the first five being major things like myself, my kids, my partner, my pets, and my friends and family, and the other five are smaller things that could vary between the warmth of a cup of coffee to an interaction I had with a stranger (reddit conversations have been written about). It starts to put everything into perspective and it’s a humbling experience. It also begins to highlight what you’d like to change in your life. Maybe you start to notice that you’re not writing very much about your financial situation or your social circles. For me, seeing all that I had to be grateful for made me see my worth more clearly. “If I’m worthy of these awesome friendships, then why is the relationship with so and so this difficult?” “If I’m worthy enough to have been given the chance at an education and succeeded, why am I not getting any traction with job hunting?” 

You’ll begin to see the toxic relationships that need to be cut out, the survival tactics or bad habits you gained along the way that are now acting as road blocks, the lack mindset you may have due to fear or insecurity, etc. Once you can see these things clearly and can remove or manage these issues, it clears the path for what you want. You have to make space. 

Also, be careful with the language you’re using. Don’t describe yourself negatively. Even avoid saying, “I’m broke.” **broke = broken** Language is very powerful, and when you’re ready to manifest, use present tense. “I *have* a job I love” vs “I want a job I love”. 

As far as manifestation, what I do and recommend is sitting down with a sheet of paper and writing down a detailed description of what I want, no detail is too small or petty. Really focus on it and put it out into the Universe. And if you’re more visual, maybe try a vision board. I’ll be putting one of those together soon too. 

You really have to believe that what you want *wants you* and **clear the space for those things to arrive**. That’s most important."

March’s retrograde was the worst, and the entire time Mercury was in Scorpio (Oct 3- Dec 10), emotions ran *deep*. I know **so** many people, including myself, that had moments of hard sobbing over the past few weeks until Mercury shifted into Sagittarius on Tuesday. It’s been an intense wave. But the purpose was to look inward, uncover past wounds so that we can work on them, become aware of habits that may no longer be serving us so we can break them, etc. We have to dig deep in Scorpio so that when Sagittarius- the archer- comes around, we can take our bow and arrow and aim for exactly what we want!

It wasn’t until I started a Gratefulness journal that I wrote in every morning (and still do!) that things became clearer- blockages were more apparent, my wounded inner child stepped forward with all of her hurts, toxic people stood out more, etc. And that may seem like the opposite of what you’d expect, but when you start to see every good thing that you’ve manifested and/or have been blessed with, the areas that need work begin to stand out, and they’re easier to deal with once you’ve been humbled by what makes you fortunate."

She fell face first onto the pavement, the area above her eye hitting first.

Even the AVM seems to be a reflection of letting go, washing out my womb. While a AVM is rare, it’s nothing permanent, it’s nothing horribly damaging, it is purely the flow of blood. It could have been so much worse but it’s not and I’m so very grateful.

My father’s side of the family is largely conservative and, in the recent political uproars, have voiced their opinions loudly against immigrants in spite of my existence in their world, knowing I wasn’t born on US soil. To them, I’m the liberal black sheep even though it should be plain to see that I **cannot** be agreeable to their opinions when I have family members that would love to live here too."

I agree with my therapist when she says, “everyone should really be going to therapy.” And due to how much it’s helped me, I’m now considering going back to school go become a therapist myself."

Being a cartooned version of myself and finding Wailmer in a pond.  (pregnancy dream)

Giving birth to a litter of puppies inside of a UFO headed for space but stopping at The White House and being led to the bathroom by George Bush.  (pregnancy dream)

Being young again and in a pick up truck with my dad. I was in the middle and a man I didn’t recognize was in the passenger seat. My dad was driving. He had tightened my lap belt to the point of discomfort. We were traveling down a curvy mountain road. A sharp curve came up and my dad and his friend bailed out of the truck and let me launch off the side of the mountain alone. (repeat dream)

Walking into a church filled with people I didn’t recognize I at all. They’re all in mourning and I can see a casket up by the pulpit. No one is paying any attention to me. I walked to the front and looked into the casket to see my dad laying there. 

Black and white dream. Being a professor at a college by the ocean. Leaving the hustle and bustle of the school to walk the beach. Found a wooden row boat and decided to get in it and push off the sand. Everything is quiet but the sound of the water lapping against the boat. I’m far enough away from shore that the large school now looks small. I hear a sound to my right and turn to see water shooting up in a mist, and then a blue whale starts to surface. It’s the only color I see in the dream. His eye comes up above the water and we just look at each other for a while before he goes back under again. (Later that week, I drew a tarot card for myself with the image of a blue whale on it that was very accurate in meaning. The connection between the card and dream made me very emotional.)"

Mindfulness,f8g3xpt,t3_e0c1lu,1574553669.0,"I am someone who was once married to a porn addict (Sex & Love Addict as he was diagnosed). You are going down a slippery slope, my friend, and the slope leads you to a deep, dark hole that is hard to dig yourself out of. You already feel that darkness invading your headspace and, speaking from experience, that darkness can creep into your external world. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD due to sexual trauma as a direct result of being in a relationship with a porn addict. If it’s difficult to control the urge to look it up, you might even want to consider something more drastic like temporarily using a flip phone with no internet access- anything to “detox” from it, if you will."
