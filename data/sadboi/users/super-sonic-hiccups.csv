Adulting,fquyluf,t3_gl0zdr,1589666523.0,"I was disgustingly overprotected. I LITERALLY did not know how to wash a dish when I went to college. I always joked that google was my mom. I just googled how to do literally everything the first couple of years. I got maintenance assistant job my junior year. I’m a really good employee and learn fast. I learned a lot of life skills there. 

My mental health was trash. I have a laundry list of severe diagnoses. I say that my family was emotionally stupid. They love me and that’s good but they wrecked my brain and my genetics are garbage. I got in therapy and worked my ass off for years. 3 years later and so much work there’s no way I can put it into words and I’m finally seeing the light. 

It was pure hell but 5.5 years later I graduated. I got a job through connections of a professor that gives me great experience. I plan to move cities with my partner at the end of the year and get a “big girl job.” 

I still struggle keeping my apartment clean and fuck up some things other people wouldn’t and have problems I need to work on, but I’m sure it’ll all get addressed eventually. They aren’t the priority atm. 

I think being willing to learn and being open about what I don’t know and asking for help are what saved me. I identified the problems and addressed them. 

So yes, it severely affected me. I’ll live with the scars of my childhood/stunted growth for the rest of my life. Can I live a happy, healthy life and maybe not think about those scars for long intervals? Yes. Maybe a life better than others because I know how to learn things and have rebuilt myself into a capable person. I have hope for my situation. There’s been tons of progress and I expect tons more. 

Triage your problems. Find the most important. Work on as few as you can at a time so you can give them the proper amount of focus. Take it one problem at a time. One day you’ll look up and you’ll be there."

BingeEatingDisorder,fqh9iux,t1_fqh4m3m,1589371832.0,"I’ve heard many good things about it as well, and I’ve also heard many reports similar to yours. 

I believe it’s a good program. I just don’t think it’s suited for everyone. You can see from my history above that my ed is very treatment resistant. The only thing that worked for me in the past was dbt, which influenced my decision to find a program focusing on that. Dbt is the modality that is typically used for people when other things didn’t   work. 

From my experience, brain over binge seemed like a typical first level response to binging. I’ve tried many things similar, and they are just not suitable for my problems and many other people with more complex/treatment resistant disorders."
BingeEatingDisorder,fqh0fk3,t3_giqswt,1589363523.0,"My story is similar to yours. I’ve tried everything. Treatment centers, therapists, medication. I finally decided to take matters into my own hands instead of being let down by providers constantly.  I did it before with my bipolar disorder and it was the only thing that saved me (I’m medicated. I just learned how to handle my treatment/docs). 

I have a psych degree and spent about 8 weeks  searching for, studying, buying, returning, and testing different books/programs. I bought textbooks for therapists and used my previous knowledge from treatments in centers and with dieticians, school, my other mental health treatment, and experiences to learn what I needed to have in a program. I then researched most of the books available on Amazon to find workbooks that met my criteria. I settled on and am currently using these two books together for myself. 

The DBT Solution for Emotional Eating: A Proven Program to Break the Cycle of Bingeing and Out-of-Control Eating https://www.amazon.com/dp/1462520928/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_AT7UEbJYFBZG9

Overcoming Binge Eating, Second... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DG1H8V4?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share

The first one actually mentions the second one in its text. 

I’ve had bulimia or binge eating disorder for 17 years (I’m 24) and have been in 2 treatment centers. These books have been indescribably enlightening and helpful. Especially the self monitoring and review sessions in overcoming binge eating. They are better than my second treatment center. Possibly the first as well.

I recommend applying week one of Overcoming Binge Eating for 2 weeks and in the beginning of the second week apply week 1 of the DBT book. That way they’re staggered and you can really implement the concepts thoroughly. Try not to apply a concept from both books in the same week if that makes sense. 

I’ve also have been using the following book on and off. I read a big chunk of it before starting the other two programs. I’m dedicating my time to the programs for the time being but I will definitely be going back to this later. It’s not a program/workbook so I don’t classify it the same as the other two. 

Eating in the Light of the Moon: How Women Can Transform Their Relationship with Food Through Myths, Metaphors, and Storytelling https://www.amazon.com/dp/0936077360/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_nY7UEbH0KV8PR

I use my therapist to help me when I have problems doing something in the book or there’s a hump I can’t get over or a pattern I can’t figure out. I have many comorbidities so my eating disorder can’t be the main focus of all my sessions. This system seems to work well for us

I need to disclaim that I’m still in the beginning of both books and this is not a success story post. I’m just sharing my research and findings. I do have more hope in these programs than I ever have anything else. That might also be attributed to me being really ready to address the issue and/or also that I tend to be optimistic about treatments. 

Another option for you depending on where you live is an eating disorder specific dbt group. I unfortunately live in a small town and don’t have access to one within a 3 hour drive. Please look online or buy, skim through, and return the dbt manual to see what things an official group should have before paying for one. There are many “knock off” groups.

Some final notes. If you aren’t sure you’re quite ready to change, the third book might be a good place to start. Also, Overcoming Binge Eating and Eating in the Light of the Moon are both fine for electronic copies. DBT is better for physical. For the printouts in Overcoming, I just used templates I made in Google Sheets and Evernote. I tried pen and paper in the beginning but I couldn’t keep up with it. My tracking is much more accurate now."

Each “type” of hypomania and depression present differently, but would ultimately be medicated the same, so I don’t feel the need to differentiate by entering multiple moods each hour."

I found that taking immediate release adderall works well for me so I have more control of the stimulant and adding extra sedating Meds to prevent hypomania. My psychiatrist upped my atypical antipsychotics to balance out the hypomania that is stimulant induced. 

I honestly don’t pay attention to the adhd so much. I mainly want the adderall for binge eating (my pdoc knows this). I used vyvanse at first but I was up all day and it was too much. Sometimes I only take 1 adderall to balance out my moods. 

The adderall definitely helps my ability to do work. I just let the meds work when they do and then be a doofus when they wear off. I can’t take the dose I really need bc of the bp but it’s good enough to do what I need for work. I just make sure I work in the spurts that the adderall is active."

I finally found meds that I can use but finding the right dosage is hard. I am also rapid cycling which is difficult to treat. I also have a huge list of comorbitities  that affect my moods and can make it even harder for me to get stable. I have been actively trying to treat those conditions for many years. They’re just very difficult to fix. Also, many people have treatment resistant conditions. Meaning a lot of treatments don’t work for them. I’ve tried upwards of 20 medications, ketamine infusions, tms, and ect which have barely helped if at all. And most caused debilitating side effects. 

I think it was a very good thing for you to ask people and to question your beliefs. I do not fault you for having those beliefs at all. I do want to warn you that when I read this I felt angry and invalidated. Which is not your fault or because of anything you did. I just want to warn you that if you express these views to people you care about, it could turn them away or make them angry.

internetparents,fnpy2t5,t1_fnpqpit,1587154092.0,Being a witness to their pain is such a shocking statement to me. I will absolutely apply everything you’ve said but will probably drag the witness to pain thing to other parts. Thank you very much for your input
findareddit,fnpwzxh,t1_fnpnvsb,1587153528.0,Thanks for the info! I’ll definitely look into those.
DeadBedrooms,fnpwjzr,t1_fnpn0to,1587153303.0,I’ll pm you if that’s ok. I feel weird posting his specifics.

raisedbyborderlines,fnp3oqk,t3_g2qw6n,1587138666.0,"Just to put this in perspective, I did this for a friend that was down and out and she couldn’t stop thanking me. It was like 3 weeks ago and she still sends me thank yous and tells me I’m such a nice person and so thoughtful and she’s grateful to have me in her life. So. Your moms a bitch."
Daylio,fnp2nyc,t3_g3287y,1587138169.0,This is my favorite suggestion
BingeEatingDisorder,fnp20ev,t3_g2vpxs,1587137844.0,Can you expand on what you used? Especially the timing thing? I’ve never heard of that
DrinkingGames,fnouweu,t1_fnn4c7l,1587134061.0,"thanks for the update! im glad to hear it worked out. I'm also super happy to hear you changed to rules to you and your friends' tastes. we dont keep the rules the same every time we play either. When i posted it originally that was the vibe i gave, but people seemed to feel more comfortable with some hard and fast rules. we'll typically start as it is and when we get bored start making shit up depending on who's playing. 

what rules did you add? i'd love some ideas!"
oddlysatisfying,fnmlqvx,t1_fnm3rx7,1587073721.0,"Yeah I didn’t mean for that. I tried to crop it. Even when I duplicated the crop version, when I’d uploaded to reddit, it would uncrop"
oddlysatisfying,fnm2xno,t1_fnlz871,1587064168.0,I honestly feel like it’s even more useful to have a nice style you can put away when you shower and sleep. My best friend wears wigs exclusively and she can look so good in just a couple minutes where it takes me much longer.
oddlysatisfying,fnm2nm2,t1_fnlyt53,1587064030.0,Oh I didn’t notice that. It really tripped me out
internetparents,fnifg4a,t1_fnhhp0m,1586979085.0,I never would have thought of that. Thank you
quarantineactivities,fne5ck5,t1_fndar92,1586883337.0,I’m an idiot. Thank you so much.
findareddit,fne52yb,t1_fnd55rq,1586883204.0,Dicks and Brittany is anyone who has a dick or wants one and then Brittany is the hardest person to get drunk in the group
BingeEatingDisorder,fncnatg,t1_fncmt5l,1586841256.0,That was helpful. Thank you
quarantineactivities,fnck2m6,t1_fncdypx,1586838764.0,Gotta love all the peoples
quarantineactivities,fnbve9a,t1_fnbs1xv,1586823082.0,PM'd you. Please make a copy as soon as possible
quarantineactivities,fnbm9h5,t1_fnbm2qs,1586818057.0,"Good idea! I'll do that. I didn't do it initially since I made the board editable. I customize it each time I play and I kinda expected people to do that. I'll edit the original board before more people get to it.

Edit: it has been edited to add most of the rules. the formatting isn't spectacular since i tried to do it fast, but all future downloads should have the info there! thanks for the advice

Edit 2: Formatting fixed"
DrinkingGames,fnbm2f7,t1_fnblfp0,1586817953.0,"That's super helpful, thanks!"
findareddit,fnbll3h,t1_fnbkj3l,1586817703.0,"I'm not quite sure what you're asking. Squares are like spots on the board. like on candy land or snakes and ladders. there's also squares to put players' names. There's also squares for how to play and how to set up.

If you're asking what each spot means, I say in the ""How to Play"" sections that it's either self explanatory or it's a rule from King's Cup which you can find super easy on google. Everyone plays King's Cup a little differently so there's a lot of leeway there. There's one exception that I explain in the ""How to Play"" section, which is ""dicks and Brittany"". A ""Brittany"" is the person hardest to get drunk in the group. 

One of the reasons I made sure everyone could edit their own file was so they could customize their own squares and make their own rules if they wanted. I changed the squares based on the people I played with (ex. no one has a dick in the group, so you'll have to change the dick squares)"

intrusivethoughts,fn9u27i,t3_fzwt5x,1586784555.0,I’ve never heard this one! I hope this isn’t offensive but for some reason this is funny to me. Not that you have intrusive thoughts or the trouble they cause you. Just this one specific thought in a vacuum.
BipolarDisorderReddit,fn78pm6,t1_fn6vnh4,1586715474.0,"Thanks for reading! I didn’t expect anyone would given the length. 

I’m glad to hear I’m not alone. I appreciate the advice. I will use the amends and not pushing it/bringing it up. I like that mentality more than the one I have rn. 

Thank you for your support"
BipolarReddit,fn3530j,t3_fyx4sa,1586613047.0,One of my triggers is change. My roommate/best friend moved cities for a job and about a week before she officially left I started going up up and away
BipolarDisorderReddit,fn0z0vg,t3_fy3p6i,1586551524.0,"I have been in the same position many times. I even gave into it a couple times. After I failed at dying and while I was feeling like you were feeling, in the big picture (maybe not in smaller moments) I didn’t stop trying to get better. Nothing worked. Nothing worked. Nothing worked. It was so tiring. I was so terrified it would never end. I was so ashamed, so alone, so discarded, so hurt, so helpless, so empty, so out of control and in such despair. 

I kept trying things. I felt stupid because everything failed and I continually let myself down. Like I must be doing something wrong because all my efforts kept failing. They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, right? That must mean I was insane bc I kept expecting the new things I tried to help me. 

Even worse was when they would help for a little bit and then stop. That meant even when I was succeeding that I was full of doubt and didn’t believe it was real or lasting change. Always had my eye out for the other shoe to fall and for me to end back up where I was. 

But then, all of a sudden, for no reason other than that I kept trying, something REALLY worked. I felt better than ever. I was in charge of me, not my broken brain. Then it stopped working. But bc I had tried so many things, I could eliminate tons options to try, so I had a better chance of it working again. So I tweaked some things and it worked again! 

I’ve done this a couple of times in the last year. Each time the bad parts are shorter and less bad and the good parts are longer and better. I have hope again. Life isn’t terrible anymore. It’s...dare I say fulfilling? When I go to sleep, I’m excited for the next day. 

When I was depressed, I thought happy people were faking it or didn’t know the reality. The depression brain was the brain that knew what was up and happy brain was a stupid idiot. Thats not the case. Happy brain knows shit. Happy brain knows shits and HANDLES it. 

I still have my eye out for the other shoe to drop. It inevitably will. But I’m hoping it will be shorter and I can get back to happy sooner. 

I say this to encourage you to not give up. There are countless combinations and things you can try. That might be overwhelming to hear. But my mom always told me “how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.” Just take it one bite at a time. Focus only on the bite you’re on. 

Focus on this moment and this problem here. If you are undeniably going to kill yourself, please make a small phone call to have someone intercede when you’re about to do it. Please. Call the police. 

If you don’t think you’re going to yet, focus on the next step that can help you. Just do that one thing for now. 

I’m rooting for you to find your heaven on earth. For you to rebuild your life from whatever ashes are around you. For you to find the sugar and water to make lemonade with the shit ass lemons you have. 

Peace exists in this world. I never believed it. I knew the pain and the sorrow and the gut wrenching trauma and all that had been stripped away from me and all that left me malfunctioning and useless would stain me forever and render me a burden to the world and every person I loved. I was wrong. 

I have deep connection, growth, fulfillment, joy, excitement, boundaries, and lots of problems too. But I can handle the problems now. I have lots of meds and lots of coping skills/therapy and a support system. 

I urge you to keep going. Death is a valid solution to your problems, but the pain it takes to resist killing yourself and the pain it takes to keep trying will lead you to something much better than death

I wish you well. I hope you continue this life. I hope you find the fresh air of happiness and stillness of safety.  

You will be in my thoughts this week. I’ve set and alarm to go off twice a day for you at 8am and 8pm. Someone is thinking about you and hoping you keep going."
