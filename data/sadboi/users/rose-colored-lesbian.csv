I had a very hard time waking up, as I was prone to anxiety attacks in the morning, so i made my availability afternoons and nights only. Started taking more hours after a few months, slowly adding more and more til I was at about 30 per week. About a year in I was promoted to full time.

Basically, start slow, but steadily push yourself just a bit more and a bit more. I can‚Äôt speak for everyone of course, but in my experience, the benefit of the distraction of having something to do that work offered far outweighed the few times I got overwhelmed or had severe symptoms in the store, and helped me learn to manage them better.

I left that job a year ago for a new one, but I‚Äôm still grateful for the opportunity it gave me to gradually build my work ‚Äútolerance‚Äù! 

(40 hours a week is still BS though if you ask me, not good for anyone‚Äôs mental health, but what are ya gonna do :/ )
