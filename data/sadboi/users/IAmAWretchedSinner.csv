Most people don't realize that the boxcutters and zipties brought onto the 4 planes in 2001 were all perfectly legal carry on items at the time.  The terrorists exploited the conventional wisdom of the time:  If hijacked, don't resist, do what the hijackers want, they'll eventually land and make demands.  Of course, this didn't happen - the terrorists made their demands, gained access to the cockpits, and hit their targets with exception of Flight 93, which only took a bunch of determined regular American guys to take the plane down and prevent a 4th strike, albeit at the expense of the lives of everyone on the plane.  Congress and President Bush created the TSA to make us all feel better.  Senator Daschle famously said something along the lines of ""If want to professionalize, you have to Federalize.""  Proponents of the TSA will point to the fact that there have been no plane related terrorist incidents on US flights since then (ignoring the shoe bomber, who was subdued by, you guessed it, regular American guys as he tried to light his shoes on fire), but imho the real reason for this is because we've hardened the cockpits and those doors don't open until the flight lands.  But most importantly, everyone (including potential hijackers) knows that if anyone ever attempt another hijacking, those regular American guys are going to subdue you, probably beat the ever living shit out of you, and you'll get to spend the rest of your life in a Federal Supermax prison, or Guantanamo, that is if you survive the initial beat down.  The TSA exists to extend Federal control, provide jobs, and provide a poor illusion of security to the American flier (not that anyone's gonna be flying anytime soon, what with COVID-19)."

On the upside, though, I used paroxetine for well over 10 years before it stopped working, and switched over to sertraline, which is great for depression and OCD, but hasn't been as good for anxiety.  However, my anxiety is of the panic disorder flavor, so sertraline may work just as well for your GAD and social anxiety, as they appear to be less severe (although they may not appear that way to you).

Wellbutrin: 8 out of 10.  Wellbutrin was a great adjunct to Paxil, and combined with eating right I lost all the weight I had gained, which was about 50 lbs.  The Paxil/Wellbutrin combo was perfect for me,  and it sucked when it stopped working.

Sertraline: 7 out of 10.  Started out well, controls symptoms almost as well as Paxil, but long term weight gain has been a problem.  And really bad dry mouth.

Clonazepam: 1 out of 10, not because it doesn't help with anxiety - it does -  but because it wrecks my working and short term memory, and has been habit forming, at least for me.  I won't say addicting, but I know it's going to be a shitty ride if I ever have to come off of it...

Depakote: 3 out of 10, not because it doesn't work on anxiety and mood - it does - but the sides are horrendous.  Remember that 50 lb loss, well since being on this stuff I've gained at least 70lbs, which doesn't help with the depression.  But it helps in keeping me from thinking about eating a bullet, which is something.

Xanax: 0 out of 10, only because I had a really bad reaction either to the drug itself or to the inactive ingredients.  I hear it works for a lot of people, however.

Pristiq:  0 out of 10.  Did essentially nothing so far as I can tell.  My doctor eventually agreed and took me off of it.

So there you have it - mixed at best, I suppose.  But again, I'm still above ground and doing pretty well mentally, and that, my dear friends, is something indeed."
