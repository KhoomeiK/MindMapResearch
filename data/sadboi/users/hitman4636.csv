With ping high as say 60-80ms, when you swing, enemy will appear on your screen before he sees you depending on 'Your ping+His ping'. Now as you start shooting 'Your ping' will come into play and your bullets will register accordingly(Late) but this is the best you could do.   

Now when you swing as a low pinger against high pinger enemy, you will see him before enemy and your bullets will register faster than high pinger enemy can react. (Very high odds of you winning the duel)  

When you hold an angle as a low pinger, you are more vulnerable to High ping swinger than to a Low ping swinger.  

And likewise holding an angle as a high pinger is the last thing you should do."
