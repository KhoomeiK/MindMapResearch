>Swen: We’re planning a mixture of magic items from published DnD materials and some homebrew items of similar complexity and power level.

>When you mentioned that loot will be static, is that only for magical items or is that for all items? Following this, will all magical items be know upon finding them or will a player have to use the Identify spell or something similar to discover the magical qualities an item holds?

>Swen: Identify is going to be in. And I did indeed mean magical items.

>What's your plan for magic items? Are you using the classic magic items from existing d&d source material, or are you creating your own? A mixture of both, perhaps? Will we be able to design/craft our own magic items in-game?

>Adam: We’re planning a mixture of magic items from published DnD materials and some homebrew items of similar complexity and power level.

>Also, will there be awesome items like the golden pantaloons that you have to carry throughout the game/multiple games to be able to unlock the full potential of the item?

>David: Golden pantaloons: We are creating unique items by hand. They will have special properties. I shouldn't go into details and promise golden pantaloons, so that's all I'm saying.

>Can you tell us anything about itemization? Will magical items be scarce, or will there be a lot to find?

>NickP: Not like in Original Sin. BG is a different type of game when it comes to loot and item fever. We still want to make treasure exciting, though, and that means a lot of manual work.Treasure has to make sense in the context, and that means hand-placing and hand-creating it. There will be equipment with magical bonuses, but not many - they’ll feel special, and they'll be tailor made.
