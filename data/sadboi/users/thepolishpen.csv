If you’re a slow caffeine metabolizer, meaning you get jittery and anxious for hours, NAC (supplement) and even broccoli can help metabolize nervous system exciters. 
These are two of the things that work that are backed by nutritional science. I swear by them. 

Also, learning a meditative technique was the only thing that allowed me to resolve *chronic* anxiety and panic attacks. Meditation is also backed by science. MRIs have shown that mediation changes the physical dimensions of the brown (thicker cortex, reduces the size of the stress center, amygdala, among others).

Energy/consciousness/soul(?) exists across them all, or inter-dimensionally(?). Similar to electrons and superposition. Where do they go? We don’t know, precisely. They blip out and return with *more* energy. 

10 years ago the serious conversation began about storing consciousness so that it can persist. Today, it’s discussed as an inevitability. 

If we don’t catch/upload the consciousness/soul at death, where does it go? Is the individual preserved as that transference takes place? That’s what the individual wants to know. Will I persist and will those I love persist after transference to other dimensions? What does returning to The Source really mean? We become one experiencing itself through each of us at once?

Anything can happen in the 10th dimension."

Consciousness cannot be explained within the context of brain chemistry. And an afterlife, a state of being beyond the function of biology—beyond the function of biological function—cannot be discussed or theorized using a biological model. This is due to the same reason their will be no McDonalds in the afterlife.
