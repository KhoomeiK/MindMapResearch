illnessfakers,fngft78,t1_fngey6m,1586930889.0,"It’s so crazy to me how some people judge their value off of how much attention they can get. I’ve been through way too much shit in my life to define myself by the ways in which my body is dysfunctional. I’d rather be seen as the person who is resilient despite their struggles, not the person who defines themselves by their struggles. You are not defined by what happens to you, rather, how you deal with what happens to you. Some people choose to sit around and bitch about everything instead of making the most of the one life they have to live. It’s always nice when I come across other chronically ill people who don’t just complain 24/7 and actually try to live to the fullest."

I failed out of the test at the same time all the obese kids deemed physically unfit dropped out and I was yelled at and called lazy for it. At the time I was misdiagnosed with asthma and my gym teacher would tell me to take my inhaler and get back out there when I was struggling to breathe, even though I told her that the inhaler doesn’t help.

ptsd,fd6n6dg,t1_fd6l3fl,1578193346.0,"His mom got the dog to appease her daughter and spite her husband who she separated from because he never wanted a dog. She was looking for a calm snuggly dog yet got the first dog she saw and liked, despite having none of the qualities she wanted. It was a terrible idea from day one to get a dog out of spite. She said the dog was going to be her new companion while her kids are at school but it seems like all she does is complain about the way the dog acts and long for her kids to come home from school so they can take responsibility for her in the time that they’re home. My boyfriend was the only one in the household not begging for a dog yet he’s the one who gets stuck caring for her 90% of the time because his sister is too busy sleeping and complaining that the dog is too poorly behaved and his mom is either at work or saying that her back pain is acting up and she can’t walk a dog who pulls so much (she has had the back pain even before getting the dog and should have taken it into account). They don’t even have a fenced in yard so most of her exercise is throwing a ball down the hall in the house so the dog crashes into everything, causing further frustrations with everyone. As an animal lover I’m so conflicted and upset at how this dog was picked based on looks yet nobody in the family can properly care for her. I don’t know how to break it to him that it would only be fair to the dog to rehome her to someone with an active lifestyle and patience to train her."
ptsd,fd6iofi,t1_fd6h3i5,1578191626.0,"Thank you so much for all the info, I’ll pass it along to him. I’m beyond frustrated with the situation. The family consists of one adult with 2 jobs and 2 kids in college who aren’t around most of the time. His sister insisted that they HAD to get a pitbull despite not having enough time or endurance to exercise her properly so she acts out extra horribly when she lacks exercise which is quite often. When I yelped after she bit me, she kept jumping on me and tried to push me off the bed and get even more on top of me. I’ve never owned a dog either so I don’t know much of how to properly respond yet they also hardly know anything. I love his family and all but if you can’t suit the needs of the dog financially or lifestyle-wise, you are doing a disservice to them and everyone who then has to interact with your horribly behaved dog. This is especially concerning because I’m in the process of obtaining a service dog and she’s super dog aggressive too so I would never bring the dog to his house with her behaving the way that she does. They have had her for 6 months and have made no effort to help with her dog aggression. I hate to say it but it makes me want to suggest rehoming her but I know my boyfriend would be pissed if I brought that up. Their lifestyle is fit for a lazy, calm dog, not a high energy high prey drive one. Not too mention how they walk away when frustrated with her. The dog will bite his sister’s feet and instead of correcting her, she just gets pissed and locks herself in another room. This dog is getting horribly mixed signals that are ruining what little training she has"

She really doesn’t know many commands either so saying “off” or “down” means nothing to her because nobody in the house kept up with the one bit of training she did go through.
