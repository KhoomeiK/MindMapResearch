When did I use my disorder as an excuse? An excuse for what? Calling you out on being an ass? Again, maybe I just misread what you meant, in that case I'm sorry. But it seems you easily get into arguments on this sub so maybe I'm not the problem.

As I said and as you can see from my posting history you can clearly see I'm actively seeking help, I believe I can learn to live with this. You made yourself sound like someone who does not understand the struggles of having AVPD that's why I responded like that.

I think a lot of parents can be in denial about their child's mental health or just don't know how to deal with it (happened to me too). I can't say anything about how your parents feel about you. If they haven't straight up told you that they hate you, you can't be sure it's true, it could be your mind telling you these things. 

Is there a reason you don't care about excelling in school?

Also, do you actually want to die or do you just want your situation to get better? This is a thing I ask myself every time I feel suicidal. It's good to think about it and to be realistic about what actually is the problem.

Do you have anybody close you feel comfortable talking to? Maybe somebody from outside of the situation like a teacher from school?

It's just difficult for me to accept that my brain doesn't work the way it used to. I feel like a constant failure, but when I think of colleagues who are at the same level as I am, I don't think of them like failures or as inferior,, so that's just me being dumb...

Others complain about her too sometimes but she can be nice too, after my breakdown she acted somewhat sweet and even said I was smarter than other colleagues (which was just a dumb and mean thing of her to say). I will talk to our manager if she continues her behaviour after today, or to someone from my school.

I will try to seek help, a few months ago I mentioned to my doctor that I was suicidal, he eventually got me a referral but I canceled it because I was too anxious.. I'll have to wait until next year because of insurance and Covid19, but I really do plan on getting help.

I really do want to get help, it would feel so good to finally be able to talk about my feelings and to work out a plan, I'm just so scared...

I don't know anybody besides those people and my direct family doesn't go to therapy. One of those friends is studying psychology but she has no idea about my struggles and I don't know her well enough to bring it up... We barely talk... Though she might have some good referrals for me! It's just scary :/

Honestly, bless Reddit. Reddit is the only way I've finally found a name for what has been destroying my life for years now and it's so good to finally talk to people!

I will try to do that yeah, they're barely involved in my life besides them telling me everything I should be doing :/ But at the same time they're one of the few people who I feel somewhat safe interacting with.

AskReddit,fozvmh0,t1_fozuc4l,1588197658.0,Ah great! Would you mind secretely whispering her name to me hehehe you've made me curious!
SelfHarmScars,fozvj3p,t1_fozujfv,1588197611.0,"Ah, I see! Sorry, didn't check your profile before responding hehe,,
I personally don't know the difference in selfcare between burns and scars but as long as they're not flaming red, with puss, hot to the touch, you're most likely good. The ones you show in your picture look like they're healing up well (source: I'm a nurse and also selfharm haha)."
AskReddit,fozuaao,t3_g0g4gs,1588196979.0,I'm a little late her but have you found her name? You could look or ask on selfharm.pics
SelfHarmScars,foztos1,t3_ga0lbn,1588196679.0,"Yep, those will mostly likely either fade completely or turn white . Nobody would see them unless they're actively looking for them."
SelfHarmScars,foztib5,t3_ga0vgg,1588196589.0,What kind of scars do you mean? These personally don't seem different from my usual. Do you mean the placement?
illnessfakersgonewild,fouils2,t1_foufqw6,1588084740.0,Well then I'm curious as to why you think that :0
illnessfakersgonewild,foufnt7,t1_fosmk6j,1588083172.0,"It looks like an absence, which is a short type of seizure. She blinks her eyes (very common) and seems to zone out. It's more common that an absence lasts about a minute rather than a few seconds but it can happen. It is true that seizures can look vastly different, I've seen people undress as a symptom of their seizures and it's really hard to fake epilepsy to get a diagnosis... But it does look really odd, I agree :/"

illnessfakersgonewild,fos5n0k,t1_fos2w0j,1588024411.0,"Ah I see! So glad nobody is faking their suicide here ^^',,  thanks for the clarification!"
illnessfakersgonewild,foq5ihr,t1_foq5hhb,1587983746.0,Or is crpl-pnk not the person you mean?
illnessfakersgonewild,foq5hhb,t3_eklr1r,1587983717.0,"Little confused here, a tumblr blog with the exact user name @crpl-pnk has a post from 2018 from their family saying the user killed themselves?
Hmmmm :/"
Nurse,fopyjew,t3_g8moui,1587976507.0,"This is 100% why I work in handicapped care! Whenever I go to work, my goal is to make all my residents have a good day. I always receive the unconditional acceptance when I give that to them."
SelfHarmScars,foolhn2,t1_fooh3a1,1587941358.0,"How strange :/ never heard of anything like it! Like the other comment suggested, just keep an eye on it! If it starts hurting when it didn't before, I'd suggest you seek some medical advice from someone you can see in person, just to be safe!"
SelfHarmScars,foo2b0s,t1_foo1upm,1587931107.0,Hell yeah!
SelfHarmScars,foo24t1,t3_g8j6e2,1587931010.0,What did it look like before exactly? Is it bleeding on the surface or is it just turning red?
SelfHarmScars,foo1pua,t3_g8k7z1,1587930774.0,Looks good! I bet you're proud😊
SelfHarmScars,fontgiq,t1_font33g,1587926131.0,Oh I see! I was already curious! It's so great you have a friend like that :)
SelfHarmScars,fons6io,t3_g8gpw1,1587925417.0,I wonder about the context of this picture. Do you cut it together?
ShitMomGroupsSay,fomxo3p,t3_g851y7,1587906975.0,"Ah yes, because vaccines have disinfectant in it."
Leprous,fokyijd,t1_fokxv5m,1587851378.0,"Okay, I'll admit that's pretty epic. A lot of their songs live are so much more awesome live :')"
