Speaking from experience, most people eat wayyyyy too much sodium and nowhere near enough potassium. If you're trying to feel better to kick your weight loss off try sticking to 2000mg sodium a day.

To make a long story short, my sister has a 16 y/o kid that I grew up with (I was a late accident and thus a young uncle). We've always been on good terms.

Recently I met her BFF, a girl she's been friends with since kindergarten. They occasionally have fights and typical teenage drama, but have always been good friends.

After everyone went to bed, she and I hung out and talked. We found out that we have a lot in common (including our sense of humour) and had a really nice conversation. Talked a bit more the next day, same thing.

Ever since we've occasionally been talking online, and today she asked if I wanted to hang out sometime. While I really wouldn't mind spending more time with her, I can't help but feel that it's either weird due to the age difference or that it may cause problems in the long run between me and my niece (especially if they fight again).
