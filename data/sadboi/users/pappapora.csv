Anyone who has played the show for a few years know that home run is great way to get your eye in, level up at mind numbing speeds and get a few diamond players because the showdowns have pitchers whose stamina never drops.
San Diego have made a conscious move here to push stubs up and for the players who spent time grinding at 25 Xp  home run should not have been on the list of things to do.
