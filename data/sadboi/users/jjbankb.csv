Both of my sisters saw my grandmother pass in a bus and wave and smile at them. Both of them where even more spooked when we met up about 30 minutes later and they both had seen the exact same thing. 

I was always a bit skeptical because they had seen it but i didn’t, but thought of it as a little check in from her. Reading this similar story i’m a little more compelled to believe it!!"
ptsd,fpitrri,t1_fpilwgr,1588648536.0,"Its hard making friends with other ptsd people. In a way they “get it”. But also bonding on the basis of trauma is not really a lasting bond usually. And having shared trauma doesn’t mean the other person knows how to comfort you, or act right or be a good friend. 

I’ve also had cptsd from childhood and my mom does a similar thing. Like every conversation between us seems like a heart to heart or a therapy session for her about traumatic stuff. I had to start setting boundaries and limit my interaction a bit unfortunately to avoid getting triggered. But i’m happy i did!"
ptsd,fpff8z8,t3_gcwyeq,1588569513.0,"Honestly misery LOVES company. I had a friend who also had PTSD and was open about pursuing a case against her abuser. Because i was pretty tight lipped about what happened in the past, she would wait until we had a few drinks to ask me pointed questions to see if it was a sore spot and I would cry. She was satisfied I guess when I was triggered and wept. She thought we were more bonded after that, and I decided to stop being friends with her. Trauma bonding mixed with trauma olympics. A stupid game."

Some guys are really square and don’t know how to approach other people who don’t adhere to the  “bro code”. Their brain cant handle actually connecting and speaking on a sincere level. Easier for them to keep everyone at an arms length and lay on the “no homo” with all their companions. Its sadly restrained. I feel like it has a lot to do with the concept of “toxic masculinity”, and there’s a lot that goes into it. 

Although I want to mention, masculinity in itself is not toxic. I feel like manhood exists outside of stereotypical machismo. There are a million ways to be a man, but only if you feel you are one! Feel free to continue exploring.

Super nice of you to get your wife such a fun gift!


Here is my suggestion

-Spend $20-30 on the bag: at target/ulta look for something with a waterproof interior, a few compartments, and aesthetically pleasing to your wife’s taste.


Some one size fits most/safe but fun options for you to buy are

-Mascara: I see she is using covergirl, try getting her a “bestseller” brand mascara from ulta or sephora which can be a little nicer. I like twofaced’s mascaras but there are quite a few options. 

-makeup brush kits: super useful! Usually come with 4-6 brushes in them. Sonia kashuk (at target in the US) has great and inexpensive options. 

-small eyeshadow palettes:  to be safe I usually go with neutral (brown and similar) tones when buying as a gift for others. It looks like your wife likes to keep all her things in one bag so i would avoid huge palettes like the jaclyn hill/morphe ones other people have mentioned. An example of a nice one would be: HUDA BEAUTY Obsessions Eyeshadow Palette


A lot of other makeup like lipstick, blush, and foundation should really be chosen by the person wearing it, so a gift card doesn’t hurt!! 

Something I like to do while makeup shopping is to quickly check reviews online so I know the product works well/ is good quality before purchasing because unfortunately there are some bad products out there. Try to avoid drugstore makeup. Or dont be afraid to go in with a list of three types of items you want to get her, and ask an employee at ulta/sephora for the best of that item. 

Hope this helps!!"
