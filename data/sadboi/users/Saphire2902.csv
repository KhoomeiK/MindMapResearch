I think we are very far from assigning symptoms their biochemical raison d'etre.

I actually dont think schizophrenia has any advantages or that schizophrenics are somehow extra inteligent or extra creative ; we just hear more from those who are.
But here is the dilema : if schizophrenia  has no advantages, why has it not been bred out so far? 
The most famous example is of course Hitler, who managed to exterminate german schizophrenics ( and other mental patients) as a dry run for his Final Solution; yet after the war, the incidence ( not prevalence) of schizophrenia was just as high.
