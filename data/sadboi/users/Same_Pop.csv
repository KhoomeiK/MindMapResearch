I've been on the pill since I was 18, but this is the first guy I've done this with, and we did have a conversation about what we would do should an accidental pregnancy occur.

Also remember, it's actually very difficult to get pregnant. I always try to remind myself that when I get nervous."

If it's really making me uncomfortable, I'll either ask them to leave me alone, or make eyes with my boyfriend and signal him to come over. I'll give him a quick kiss when he joins me to nip it in the butt.

I will say though, my current boyfriend (25M) who is probably the best man I (25F) have ever been with, worked so hard and was always wanting to see me when we started dating, like even wanting to just grab a coffee for 20 minutes before I headed to the airport for a work trip after our second date.

I'm guilty of this too, so you're not alone!) 

I definitely think you should talk to him about it, but I do want to say if he's just looking her up because, like you said, they were best friends and he misses having her in his life, and it might be worthwhile to let him have that friendship back, or at least talk about letting that friendship reform. Especially since he moved away from all of his friends. I know that sounds scary but he also moved for you, so I think those actions speak louder than if he wants to rebuild a friendship with someone he way back one had feelings for. 

I don't know the best way to go about bringing it up without admitting that you looked through his search history...which I think you can just own up to and be like I'm sorry I snooped, but can we chat about this? 

If you don't want to bring that up, maybe next time he brings her up in a dream or something, you can ask oh what she's up to these days? If you just want to know if they've been talking again etc."

It also doesn't have to be a big deal, it can be a more casual thing you just say like ""im not seeing other people"" or something. It doesn't have to be a direct ""are you sleeping with other people"" convo or anything.

About a month and a half in, I told my boyfriend something along the lines of I wasn't seeing anyone else and he just said same and that was that for our convo about exclusivity. 

If you initiating things becomes a problem for you, or it's already a problem and you want that to change, then that's a different story, and goes beyond you bringing up exclusivity I think. 

Good luck!"
legaladvice,fbx2jwm,t3_eex1aj,1577166823.0,"I think it depends on where you are, from my experience in the US you are the photographer and therefore you own the rights to the photos so you can do with them what you please.  

That being said, if you signed a contract with the venues giving them the rights, then you would not own them and can't print them without getting the ok and rights from the venues etc.

If you just handed over the photos with no contract you'd still be the rights owner and should be able to publish the photos.

relationship_advice,es8fsqc,t3_c6fhty,1561696424.0,"This is probably not the answer you want to hear but, your best friend, mother, and therapist have it right. 

First off, I just want to say, you obviously know your gf better than any stranger on Reddit, but here are my thoughts. 

Ik you're hurting, but in my opinion, it's not fair to her in this situation, and those closest to you have said that as well. Assuming your best friend and mother know her well too, they would not lead you astray here, and I think they gave you sound advice. Plus they know you and her better than me or any other stranger on here.

I'm a 24F and I've been cheated on in the past, and I know for me I was unable to function like real myself for days after I found out, and that's not a position you want to put her in when she's already so vulnerable as it is in this new place. 

She will be pissed regardless of whether you tell her now or in 4 weeks, and if you really love her, I think you already know the best thing for her is to let her complete this training.  You basically said so in your post - but again, you know her better than I do. 

People make mistakes, and I'm so sorry you're struggling. I cant imagine, but think about how good it is that you have people around you to support you. I think it's only fair for you to give her that chance at support too when she comes back.

I realize this is so hard to bear, but I would really think about your loved ones that have told you to do the opposite of what you have planned right now.

It's hard for me/anyone here to know if she is just forgetful and hasn't archived them, or lazy and hasn't archived them or actually just wants to keep them on her phone since I'm not her.
