hydroxychloroquine, which prevents viral reproductions, needs to be given early to keep the viral load low and therefore prevent clotting and damage to lungs. But this med has been around for a very long time, and though it’s known to cause some changes in heart beat in rare occasions, pre-Covid research on this showed that the changes weren’t life threatening and the medication was safe. That being said, it could mean life threatening changes for someone having heart issues as a result of systemic clotting causes by SARS-CoV2. It really is a med that needs to be given early for it to be both affective, and continue to stay safe to take."
seculartalk,fptd8sn,t1_fpt4li4,1588889130.0,"Dude is jogging in thin workout shorts and a white shirt. What exactly could he have stolen from the construction site that would not be blatantly apparent? 

Every neighborhood I’ve ever lived in in the south, everyone goes into homes under construction and checks them out. I’ve had whole hour long conversations chatting up a friend from inside a house under construction, looking at the design features and layout. All my neighbors in many different areas I lived in did this, just to look, with deep respect to the property/house and tools. My parents too. I’ve been to small get together inside homes under construction thrown by the kids who’s parents are building the new house. Not once did anyone think they could be “accidentally” shot for it, certainly not so after clearly and visibly leaving with nothing. 

The type people who steal from construction sites bring trucks, or at least a bike. You don’t go out jogging and leave with a band saw or stripped copper. And construction workers don’t leave their tools overnight on sites that can’t be locked up, or are missing doors and windows. 

The dad and shooter was a former law enforcement officer. There is no way he actually believed the jogger had stolen something. He damn well knew better. 

One cannot jog or run more than a few yards with a weapon in the elastic band of workout shorts. Had they actually suspected he was carrying a weapon, they definitely would have said so when the 9-1-1 operator asked them why they were calling, why this jogger was a threat. 

In the 9-1-1 call, the operator asked the father what the jogger had done wrong to warrant the call, and the father did not respond to that question. As a former law enforcement officer, he knew he could not say anything had been actually done by the young man he was following."

Coronavirus,fpjmf5x,t1_fpjff5d,1588673956.0,"Per the lab’s own published research, they made a bat SARS-CoV that was capable of human to human transmission years ago so they could research this specific scenario we are currently in. The idea behind this type of admittedly dangerous “gain of function” research is that it would provide answers for future pandemics and make outbreaks easier to spot, though none of this research helped with the pandemic we have been facing. 

Also, back in Jan 2019 they released a report stating they found a naturally occurring SARS-CoV that they suspected had the capacity to infect humans. It was in a bat population over 900 miles away from Wuhan. I’d be shocked if they weren’t housing that sample too. 

None of us here can truly say with certainty where it came from, but we can talk about possibilities. when an outbreak starts less than 1,000 feet away from a lab known to contain and research the same family of viruses, it’s certainly not an unreasonable speculation that the outbreak came from the lab. Truth be told, it’s probably the more likely scenario? All the places in China, all the places in the world, it spawned next to the lab that was known for its research in bat SARS-CoVs, including human to human transmission of these viruses."

I too think this is likely more dangerous than they are saying. 1, I found out the flu does not actually kill as many as at least the US’ Center for Disease Control (over)estimates each year, well over what actually unfolds over each year. The number of flu deaths is in the thousands, not in the tens of thousands. There are some articles out there discussing this, doctor networks adding they have never had any patients die from the flu, and if estimates were accurate, they would have a number of them over the years. I have never personally known anyone to die from the flu or even be hospitalized for it. But I know 3 people who have died from the SARS-CoV19, and though it’s just anecdotal, I do feel between all this info, it’s certainly possible for CoV19 to just be worse.

It’s really great you are rolling with the punches right now. That’s a good place to be mentally. Lord knows, stressing hard over it is not helpful. Gotta keep those cytokines as low as possible.

Thetruthishere,fpc652e,t1_fpbz74c,1588488889.0,"It’s all so crazy. I’m still sort of shocked by it all. And I really can’t explain it. It’s hard to wrap my mind around.


So the portals had me asking her lots of questions, but she did not know much about it either. Just that they exist and can account for why some properties will have a lot of paranormal activity. Her story is a wild one a wild one as well and she got thrown into this and did not know all that much about it. I can go into that later

So I only listed out some of the common, almost everyday occurrences. We also had a lot of one off guest appearances, lol. Or maybe a figure I saw once, and then another family me never saw later and then we were both shocked to find out we saw the same guy in the same part of the house. But then never saw it again. Or there was an old lady my mother would see around her bedroom, but that only happened maybe 8 times and only in a 3 year period and then never again. So while we had usual crazy stuff that happened often, there were also some oddities that popped up here and there over the years so the portal concept seemed plausible, I guess. 

My personal opinion is that maybe it’s a door to another, lower dimension? But I honestly have no clue. And I have no clue as to why it would be there. 

So some of the stuff had a horrible feeling and some of the stuff felt non-threatening. The tapper I mentioned earlier, she (assuming because of the perfume scent that came with the chill as she stopped at my bed before continuing to tap) or it felt safe. I could tell it to stop and it would. I just guessed that maybe it was a protective measure but to be honest, I have no clue. But it never felt bad, just annoying. Though when I was younger, it did scare me a little. 

my room, and the whole house, had a bad feeling to it. But definitely my room. My very close friend in middle school who was always said to have some psychic ability (super low key about it and respectable) would spend the night, but one night I had fallen asleep in the guest room where he slept, and because I’m female and to be respectful of the rules we were to always go to our separate rooms at the end of the night. So he did not want to wake me and decided to go sleep in my room for the night. I woke up in the morning to him asleep on the floor, no blanket or pillow, and I woke him up to ask him why and he responded with “there is something very evil in your room and I will never sleep in there again.” In an alarmingly sober tone. But I was elated because someone else experienced what I experienced, without them knowing I experienced it too. He was not the type to scare easily what so ever and paranormal stuff did not freak him out. He would not go into much detail, but he said he felt a palpable feeling of awful feelings and needing to leave and that he was being stared at from the same corner I experienced my stuff from. Also, I never experienced this menacing, being stared at feeling when the tapper was present, hence why I suspect the protection in her actions. 

As you can see, it’s a lot. As for the woman who cleared the place. She was just a doctors office receptionist. She had open heart surgery 2 years prior, and when she woke she says she had these beings with her that she could hear and feel. And they told her things about spirituality and as I will put it, ghostly matters. They taught her how to clear things and would tell her who needed help with the paranormal. I was one of those people. When she approached me about it, she was like “this is going to sound crazy but...” and then she told me my house was haunted and all the ways it was haunted, and she was accurate. And I’m very poker face about this stuff because I know scam artists will let you tell them what they need to know, so I shut down and give no clues, no confirmation so I can truly see legitimacy in their words and actions. From my experience, she’s the real deal. 

As for the cleaning of the property, she sends her beings to handle it. They clean the house. It’s wild stuff. I can’t speak to the validity of this claim of hers, but after “they” were sent to do their thing, the house was void of paranormal activity and actually felt different. 

2 years later, some stuff came back when I was home from college. I had some doors slam in the middle of the night (new activity not experienced before) and then the light from another room get blocked out by something. I bolted. Had her clean the place again and to this day, all activity has stopped never to return, and it’s been probably 10 years?

I also had her clean an apartment of mine. I had lived there for almost a year and all was perfectly normal, but then some small odd stuff started. I paid no mind because it was so minor to my past experiences but one night my SO totally panicked and he did not believe in the paranormal at all. Stuff started flying off the shelves onto my SO while I sat calmly looking at it from the living room, lol. He did not have a chance to see it but I could see a small glowing white orb, which up until that point I did not believe was a thing. I’m a photographer and I know the only orbs in photos I’ve ever seen were absolutely a product of natural, normal causes. 

My SO is screaming and freaking out in anger (because he gets angry when he does not know or understand what’s happening) so I tell him I will handle it. And make my call to the woman. She tells me in the next 3 weeks she will get to it and call me after she has. Things go back to normal and quiet. And then one night, shit gets weird. Of course my SO is out of town but he’s out of town often. I’m by myself and walk past the bathroom and I see, I SEE a being. An ancient-looking being in a tattered faded monk like robe. He’s human enough in shape and placement of facial features but it’s no normal human. His skin is sooo old and papery and he looks like a combo of the weird bug eyed guy on the cover of that Disturbed album from ages ago, and the giant old looking Sith Lord (?) from the new star wars. I saw him at a glance when passing and I freeze and lean back to look again in shock and there he is looking at me looking at him. And he looks freaked to see me, freaked that I can see him. I get this vibe of “oh shit she sees me” and then he’s gone. Because he seemed freaked of me, it alarms me but does not scare me. I still shower in that bathroom later that night. 

But in the night, the vibe changes. The rooms of the apartment, which is pretty small, feel full of people. Like if there was a party going on. We were on the 2nd story and the floors were wood so it physically feels like there are people walking or shoving, moving around through the vibration of the floor. You can even hear it. I slept on the couch with Frasier playing loudly and my earphones in listening to podcasts to get through the night, but the couch and things around the room were getting bumped into. Not hard, not shoving of furniture, but audible sounds and physical vibrations felt. I was so freaked. I had to keep telling myself that her “angels” as she calls them, were there cleaning the place so I was safe.

The next day, I get the call from her. She had them clean the place the night before. 

I don’t ever tell people these experiences because it legit sounds crazy. But here I am, lol. And that’s all of it. I can say, I’ve always been of sound mind. I have a degree in psychology. I don’t hear voices or see things that don’t exist, outside of seeing that weird being in my bathroom and onetime seeing a shadow person (in that same apartment... actually come to think of it, that marked the start of the out of nowhere paranormal activity there. And I did not believe or even know about shadow people before I experienced that. My reaction was to laugh and thing “oh come the fuck on, Universe. That is NOT a thing” lol). But anyway, I’ve stayed and lived plenty of places that had zero activity. I LOVE places with zero activity. I’m very science minded. I always try to find a logical explanation and will test out possible explanations if I can. But truth is, some shit cannot be explained... yet. I look at the paranormal and think of it much like bacteria and viruses. Both bacteria and viruses have always been around. They have always been making us sick. But we did not always know about them. Back in the day, they were there fucking with things, but the science did not exist to explain it. Then we developed tools to see these germs and could better understand it. My opinion is that the same will be said of paranormal activity. We just need to explore and find the reason why as well as the tools to see it better. Just because we can’t fully explain it does not make these experiences not real. When multiple people experience the same things over many years, both together and some of it at different times, there is something to it.

By the way, I never told anyone about the tapper except for my mother when she called me one day when I had moved away to go to college. She started to ask me “in your room, did you ever experience tapping...” and I cut her off quickly citing the always in a clockwise motion, cold spot and the tapping stops when it gets to you and smells like perfume, and she started screaming. She never handled this stuff well. I calmed her down and we figured out the only difference between her new experiences with the tapper and my years of living with it was that when it got to her, it smelled of feces. So while I always think of it as a protective ghost or energy or whatever, perhaps it wasn’t, as I’ve heard on here that can be a sign of a bad energy. But perhaps it was a copy cat. I don’t know. This is why we need more science on this topic. :)

Edit: holy shit, sorry for the novel. Come to think of it, this is why I don’t talk anour my experiences. It’s all connected and hard to explain without going into a little of all of it."

Thetruthishere,fpbws83,t1_fp8q5lf,1588480781.0,"Right?!!? I have no clue. But it worked. We did not even know when she would do it. Just that it would happen at some point in the following two weeks. She waited until she felt up to the challenge. 

But we knew the day after she did it. And then later when I spoke to her, she told me the day and it was the day before we noticed everything crazy in the house stopped. We mostly had a lot of loud banging on walls and furniture, some human sized cold spots, rooms would go noticeably cold before the banging or furniture shoving would occur. I realize this probably sounds crazy or scary, but for us it was just every day. I grew up with it so at an early age, it became not scary and more annoying. 

The wildest part was that she, again from afar, was able to accurately tell me what I and my family had experienced for years and had not told anyone about it. Even weirder, she was able to tell me about experiences I had not even told my family. I had grown up with a thing that would go around my room tapping objects, always in a clockwise motion, and when the tapping got to me, the air would get cold and often smell like perfume and then the tapping would continue. And it was not slow moving but like walking pace around the room. By middle school, this activity would keep me up so I would yell at it I was trying to sleep and to please stop. And it would, for anywhere from 5-10 min and the start up again. 
Well, the woman who cleared the house told me about this, even though I never told her or anyone about it. 

She said there were portals on our property. I still have a hard time fathoming this or believing it. It’s just all so wild. All I can do is take her word for it, but she asked for no money, told me things she should not know and was able to clear the house so I have no reason to not believe her. It’s just still all so hard to believe. 

Needless to say, as a result of living in this house for a good portion of my life and growing up, I’m more prone to being scared to be alone in any house at night. I’ve learned that it’s possible for unexpected, unseen forces could pop up, even though I can tell and have experienced most homes to be just mundane, normal, and void of the paranormal. 

I know if I had not experienced these things, there is no way I would believe these type things to be true."

Within a month of infection, antibodies are no longer made, thus the test shows no antibodies so it reads as negative when the person is still suffering with an infection.

There are other, more accurate tests for Lyme disease now which shows these people just still have the bacteria in their blood and thus still have an active infection. And it’s not uncommon for a round of antibiotics to not work for a spirochetal infection like lyme. They are biologically and structurally more difficult bacteria to kill. 

This info in relation to the article and CoV19: 
I would not necessarily trust that someone showing active symptoms from CoV19 is not contagious. And suffering with symptoms of viral infections and/or CSF/ME after a recent (not long term infection) viral infection is in fact evidence the infection is still quite active and present. You don’t develop lasting viral symptoms or CSF/ME from an infection that came and completely left within a month. No other virus works like that. CoV19 would not be the exception.

And OP, my comment is not directed at you. Just the article and for anyone who might be reading it for info. Thank you for sharing this. Personally, I’m very concerned about any lasting impact this virus might have on people’s health. Thanks again!"

COVID19positive,fpbq6nj,t1_fp9wwbs,1588475977.0,"While it’s always good to come to terms with one’s own mortality, don’t give up hope just yet. I had several often lethal infections for over 20 years. By the time I was able to figure it out and demand the right test which showed I had those infections, I was told there was no way to get rid of them after having them for so long.

But there are ways to beat infection, boost (really just heal back to normal strength) the immune system. I found a doctor who taught me the impossible was possible with the right combo of approaches. I don’t believe this virus is any harder to beat than any other currently know chronic virus. So if this is chronic, just know, there are other tools that can help you heal if you need them, and the right doctor can get you there.

One possibility, and it’s just a possibility, is that it could be that this SARS-CoV19 is the bioengineered bug made a while back. A top lab in India said this back at the beginning, and several other respected virologists, and one cooky virologist has since reported the same, and all have said the same thing: that this virus contains HIV DNA, 4 segments specific to HIV only, and that these 4 segments make it very hard to eradicate in the body. IF this were true, catching this virus could result in issues down the road for people who are infected with it. Perhaps this needed to be looked at and in the meantime, treated with extreme caution. Or perhaps this is what inspired the extreme caution.

I did not know about astral projection at the time, but everything else fit. I was awake, body still on bed, some weird glowing tether, and knowing moments before seeing someone in the room was a total dream. I laid back down on my body and got back in, but then could not move and had to moan until my SO touched me to wake me. And then I gasped and said “oh thank god, I thought I was going to have to wait all night for you to do that...” lol. Needless to say, it left my SO very confused.

A president has to be able to speak ideas clearly, even if he has to say one or two words a few times over. The ideas still need to be clear and not wildly off topic to the point of ‘I love having children on my lap’ void of context. 

His  inappropriate smelling and touching of women and girls is not a symptom of a stutter. His inability to properly read the reactions, the horror, anger and shock on people’s faces is absolutely not a symptom of a stutter. At worst, he is willingly and actively disregarding the women/girls who clearly don’t want to be sniffed and touched by him. But most likely, he just lost his filter, understanding of social norms, and ability to read emotions as a result of dementia. Truth is, dementia is the best fit (also, he act just like someone who’s brain is calcifying. It’s almost shockingly a match) and if his behavior is not a result of dementia, he’s just a massive sack of shit."

And when speaking can be doing fine, and then completely loose the ability to organize his thoughts to the point he is no longer speaking coherently. And this isn’t the result of forgetting his next thought or talking point. This is the result of forgetting what he said, the point of the engagement, possibly where he is, and who is speaking to.

There is lengthy footage of him taking photos with newly sworn in officials (senate maybe? It’s been a while since I watched it) and the entire time he’s handsy with women and girls. Later in the footage, he gets handsy with an elderly woman and you can see the intense look of shock on her face, even though he’s super close to her and inches from her face, her expressions are lost on him.

I know about ozone therapy because my doctor used this on my infections and infections of others I met getting treatment there. It worked exceedingly well by creating a hyper-oxygenated environment in the body, and with covid affecting oxygen levels, this treatment could be beneficial to patients in multiple ways.

That being said, I could definitely see the negative impacts of 5G (because there definitely is some level of negative impact) perhaps causing people’s immune systems to be lower and therefor make Covid19 worse.

Also, I’m not sure where you are getting that info. There are people getting sick in areas without 5G. People getting sick in areas with 5G, then leaving those areas and still not getting better, so if it was the result of EMF sickness, they would get better when they leave the 5G area.

I did not know about this until the tweet was shared, and I am one of the high risk people for this. I’ve had a virus give me blood clots and it almost killed me.

Covid 19 is not the first virus known to cause this. Anything that causes high inflammation for longer than a week can cause blood clots, stroke and vasculitis."
