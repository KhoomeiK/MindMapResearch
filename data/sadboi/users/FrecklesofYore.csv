That said, think hard on it objectively and sleep on it. The feeling worsens when we are exhausted and sleep helps us see more objectively after a good rest.

The choice is yours in the end but please sleep on it first and decide when your mind is a bit more objective.

Everyone is manipulative. From toddler years we manipulate to get what we want (crap I'm in trouble, initiate cute mode). Where it's bad is if you manipulate to harm. Like intentionally harm, not byproduct harm.

From their POV they see that we manipulate to harm and excuse ourselves. Personally I only manipulate to a degree as a defense or to help and get what I want.... So the normal. I can't say I was in the same mindset when I was younger, due to misdirected self hatred, so I can see where the people victimized by those with bpd are coming from. I think of it this way, if you're bitten by a snake, then you're probably never going to feel safe around any snake ever again. Now replace snake with BPD (and some think of the two as synonymous).
