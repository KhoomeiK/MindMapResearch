ValveIndex,fcqjroo,t1_fcq5lg3,1577887240.0,Same issue unfortunately...I really want the developer to add support for Redux. u/lukeross00 I feel like it may not  be possible since the mod must change the FOV or something but if it works in third person there's a chance
ValveIndex,fcm2gbm,t1_fcly773,1577762490.0,Nope I wish but everything looks/performs better on my end
ValveIndex,fckwf9v,t1_fcjfhjo,1577734653.0,Gotcha. I mean the physics of driving are much better and the overall contrast is much better too. I also like the weather and time effects more. Overall more scenarios too so it makes it feel more lively.
ValveIndex,fcix7tv,t1_fciudjo,1577671982.0,"It has a weird FOV for some reason and your head turning is super sensitive. I have to say though, I don't know what Redux did but the game has never looked better in VR. I am in AWE. Everyone needs to try it, I think it actually made it look clearer and more 3D with super good performance. Only thing to remember is to set Post FX to normal since there is some default motion blur when turning your head and it makes you sick. I've been using the GTA Real mod for a long time and let me tell you installing Redux is 1000% worth it even though you're in third person. You can actually use the simple trainer mod to hide your player to make it feel like first person if that's your thing too."
Vive,fc4fp32,t3_efviwb,1577415315.0,"Make sure the graphics card at bottom is your graphics card, also I found that it only started replacing settings once going into story mode for first time"
Anxiety,faf5ulu,t3_e8mot7,1576015180.0,Your anxiety is only a fear mechanism designed to keep you safe. It only has as much power over you as you let it. Our habits can increase this feeling and learning how to reduce the negative ones will ultimately allow you to more easily have control over your mind.
AskReddit,f9l66gi,t3_e5fgmo,1575415380.0,I'll have a tall mocha latte with some cream
oculus,f6jqrjz,t1_f6hjfcm,1572898804.0,Haha you're welcome!
oculus,f6gkklj,t1_f6ghv4o,1572827089.0,"Using a power adapter didn't work for me, I used the Anker one and my laptop still didn't give enough power which surprised me. It worked on my CV1 but not the Rift S, so I would recommend using a USB C adapter if your machine has a USB C port."
phillies,f3oau0a,t3_dhfgiq,1571012959.0,Girardi Girardi Girardi. He's the right guy for the job. He has managed top notch players and has had great success.
Anxiety,f38oabk,t3_dg3q8s,1570738361.0,"Yes, I started Prozac a few months ago and have noticed my focus decreased. It got really bad when I realized I lost my car. I tried an ADHD med (intuniv) and it made me extra anxious. So I tried a natural supplement for anxiety and that didn't work either. Turns out I needed a multivitamin and my focus has been better since. I'd try it, I take gummy Centrum."
cringe,f293coy,t3_dcafka,1570079078.0,Lol if Trump ever said that people would go nuts. Good luck Democrats.
oculus,f14z1s9,t3_d7u91o,1569182647.0,I think AR will be bigger simply due to the fact that instead of taking you out of the world you are born into it augments it and makes it that much better. Therefore any industry can benefit and you don't have to recreate a new world for people to adjust to.
ValveIndex,f0k10fd,t1_f0k0n1s,1568667671.0,"Hello, I would be willing to send you over a key to the app if you share the curator account with me. So far we have gotten mostly positive reviews and praise especially on the physics. Let me know! The Index controllers work super well for fielding too as you literally close your hand to catch the ball. :)"
ValveIndex,f0jv33p,t1_eymsy78,1568663725.0,"Thanks for the praise! We have reduced the price down to 20 dollars, as well as added some new content to further improve your skills. Here is a link to the video showcasing the update. :)

virtualreality,eyl2byq,t1_eyj6raz,1567174490.0,"Thanks, it will be releasing today. Keep an eye out and maybe write a review if you like it. :)"
oculus,eyl29z9,t1_eyiy3ed,1567174451.0,"Inside The Park VR is compatible with the Vive tracker and Vive Racket Sports Set. You can attach the tracker to anything. Also the Vive wands are recommended as best ""controller"" for hitting. The accurate physics actually make it feel pretty close, you'd be surprised. For fielding I recommend the Index controllers as it feels most intuitive."
Vive,ewsqi7v,t1_ewsmkyj,1565733099.0,"I plan to add additional features post-launch such as a crowd as well as additional training drills to better improve your real-life performance. Pitching is included, you can see it at the end of the video. It is currently bare bones but I am considering adding an AI batter to make it more challenging. Not planning on adding a full game mode as it is a simulator, not a video game and it is designed for training."
Vive,ewshoun,t1_ewrym8a,1565727791.0,"Hahaha, good one ;) There's actually fireworks that go off if you do hit it out of the park. It runs at 90 FPS on my RTX 2060, and it was optimized a lot so that it would run well on newer hardware. I don't have my hands on an Index yet but I will hopefully soon. It will be great on the Index, especially looking forward to grabbing the ball and actually throwing it in a more natural way. :)"
Vive,ewrcvaz,t1_ewqr062,1565702133.0,"It's different for these reasons: The physics are as close to real life as possible (multiple colliders with accurate restitutions on the bat to simulate barrel, middle, and grip, max solver iterations count to simulate almost all hit types, used real life numbers for mass and drag, no hacks, Magnus effect), there are a vast amount of customization options, it provides real-time statistics based on your gameplay, and it is meant to be a simulator to improve your real life performance, not a game."
Vive,ewrchlf,t1_ewqy47w,1565701829.0,"Yes, that's just an option to see the ball clearer and visualize the path. The menu includes that option."
virtualreality,es3yotd,t1_es28vhi,1561573428.0,"It is, especially since it's not a real baseball bat. I guess I'd have to recommend a bat like that. I like the way they mount it. Thanks for that."
Vive,es3yhxv,t1_es2l3e2,1561573316.0,Could be DiamondFX from [https://www.trinityvr.com/](https://www.trinityvr.com/). I'm aiming more for amateur training.
virtualreality,es0y18h,t1_erymr7e,1561485268.0,"It does support  the vive tracker. You can see it in the video. Problem with using real bats is its dangerous so I recommend using the racket accessory from the Vive store. You would also need to make a specific mount to attach it. With the accessory you don't need a custom mount. Works like a charm, I use it in the video."
virtualreality,erybh9u,t1_eryaf2n,1561404810.0,"Lol, not sure. I am focused on building training sims for other industries so it's a possibility."
oculus,eqsessy,t3_bz5wxp,1560283252.0,"It's a good start, but we need better content. VR software is lagging behind hardware in my opinion and it is up to us developers to change that. Don't forget, it's not just the hardware manufacturers job to make VR a success, it is ours as well. Without great software, hardware cannot function. Sure there are some amazing VR apps out there but we can do better."
oculus,epwedvu,t3_bw35kz,1559573712.0,I think they compromised too much with them. It's one thing if you want to reduce the price but they really downgraded these things. I think their main focus were the headsets this gen.
oculus,epnbhem,t3_bv1imx,1559324726.0,The original touch controllers are so much more ergonomic and just feel like a premium VR controller. Not really sure what they were thinking with the new ones.
