politics,eoh9pjg,t3_brwplr,1558576215.0,I'm glad they are actually doing what they say instead of just complaining vaguely like most companies until it blows over.
aww,eoh6hzf,t3_brwarf,1558574040.0,Thanks for cheering me up today
depression,eoh0ks0,t1_eogxwf5,1558570019.0,Thanks. Sent you a message back.
depression,eogy618,t1_eogx8w9,1558568394.0,Eh I really don't own anything fancy. After my breakup and bankruptcy I basically had to start over. My whole life has become a joke. I don't have a tv. I have a 4 year old used laptop I bought on facebook. Nothing fancy. Really just essentials for me and the kitty.
depression,eogvsw5,t1_eogufq8,1558566853.0,"Idk it's all kind of a blur now. I think they said it will be an extra $20 everyday for boarding her, but I've been looking at the laws so I don't think they can sell her for 10 days or something. I doubt they would do that. But it's just going to get outrageously expensive.

I applied for care credit before but my credit is terrible so I was not approved. Cosigned some stuff with my ex and it really meased up everything for me. Trying to fix it but stuff like this just keeps happening. Ugh"
beermoney,eogtz9p,t3_bjy78d,1558565689.0,Does this really work? Because I'm in desperate need of about $250 and an extra $50 for giving my ID seems worth it right now.
depression,eogtrn4,t3_brri6r,1558565541.0,Thanks for sharing. Seems pretty cool. Maybe it will distract me from everything
BetterEveryLoop,eognqnl,t1_eofys5l,1558561765.0,"Seriously this just makes me smile so much, but now I want to cry because I miss my cat. She would love something like this. Why am I a failure?"
legaladvice,eognekk,t1_eogm7pp,1558561564.0,"I'm actually going to try and do that when I get off soon, but I've only had this job for 2 months. And I also get paid onto one of those prepaid debit cards from work. I just opened a new checking account last month though so hopefully someone will work with me.


Update: wasn't able to get a payday loan at 2 different places because of needing a checking acct older than 3 months."
legaladvice,eogn8x3,t1_eogm0w4,1558561467.0,Yeah I asked but he said he can't really do anything because he had a few extra doctor bills to take care of this month.
legaladvice,eogizs6,t1_eogi1w5,1558558906.0,"The only person who really talks to me in my family is my uncle, but he lives on disability and his social security now so he probably can't help. My father doesn't talk to me because he didn't agree with my lifestyle. I don't really have many friends either esadly. Mostly my fault for pushing people away the past year."
legaladvice,eogi8xz,t1_eoghmuk,1558558476.0,"Sorry if you missed it, I know my post isn't organized the best. Yes I applied for care credit back in January/February but I was not approved. I have pretty bad credit after a bad breakup, cosigned a car/apartment with my fiance."
legaladvice,eoght8p,t1_eoggvau,1558558219.0,"I know, but idk what to do. I don't want to pay more and I certainly don't want my cat to be apart from me. It's not like I don't realize that it will be more expensive. I just truly don't have a choice then."
aww,eogg2ty,t3_brqrdd,1558557233.0,Aww what a cutie.
legaladvice,eogfz12,t1_eogfl8g,1558557172.0,"Thanks for replying. I guess legally they are allowed to do that then. 

I'm not trying to get out of paying, but I just can't afford the down payment they want right now. I really won't have it until next Friday, and they acted like that was fine, but then it wasn't."
freefolk,eogciov,t3_brn948,1558555179.0,"So the game of thrones final season really let me down emotionally. It's something I've been invested in for about 4 years now. I got into got with some friends during the 4th season and loved it. This may sound sad, but GOT and Marvel literally got me through some extremely depressing times in life. I looked forward to it a ton. Now I just feel empty after the ending of it. Not only is it over, but it really was just terribly rushed."
depression,eogbfga,t3_brffm6,1558554565.0,"I read a post on here a few days/weeks ago, I mainly lurk reddit, but it was about how you can't even be honest with therapists because then you might get committed involuntarily. I feel like it's true, becauze I never say I'm suicidal or have suicidal thoughts even though I do. Instead I dance around it and say oh ""it's just hard to see the point"" or ""nothing feels important"". Idk kind of off topic, but I feel like it no one really gets the help they need because there is still such a stigma around mental illness and it may be years before it changes in our society."
depression,eogaa63,t3_brnn5t,1558553909.0,I really wish I could be one some days too. Mine is literally the most important thing about my life right now. She has gotten me through everything. I'm really worried about her though because my veterinarian won't let me have her back because I owe too much on a bill. It really sucks. My anxiety and depression are at full force right now and I just hope she is alright.
