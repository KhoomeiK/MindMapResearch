Interestingly enough, despite all of the research scientists and psychologists have done on the subject, we still can't 100% explain the reasons behind dreams. What we do know, is that dreams aid in processing information. Per Wikipedia (not my favorite source, but I digress), ""Dreams related to waking-life experiences are associated with REM theta activity, which suggests that emotional memory processing takes place in REM sleep."" In English, this means our dreams are influenced by our feelings and life experiences. 

I'm not necessarily convinced our dreams *mean* something. While there's plenty of pretty legit dream analysis theories out there, I believe it's ultimately up for us to decide what our dreams do or don't mean; there is not just one correct answer."

Maybe you should invest more in your relationship. Figure out where the holes are, and how to fill them (no pun intended). Might sound cheesy but I suggest you both take the 5 Love Languages quiz.

What you went through was awful, and my guess is that they know if they went through something like that, they wouldn‚Äôt be in good shape after either. They are also probably projecting many of their own fears and feelings onto you. 

I‚Äôm not here to tell you you need to go to therapy. I understand your reasoning for not wanting go, thinking it‚Äôll make things worse. However, I want to reassure you that the point of therapy isn‚Äôt to be given a label of diagnoses. In fact, many therapists don‚Äôt even do that, nor would they take away your permit. 

What therapy *can* be about is having a space to process and talk about the things that have happened to you; things you probably can‚Äôt talk about with your extremely concerned and stress-inducing family members. Seriously, if anything go to therapy to rant about how annoying your family is being through all of this‚Äî I‚Äôd have lost it by now if I were you. 

When I was 18 my (now ex) boyfriend refused to go to therapy for his depression because he was afraid they would take away his right to carry a gun. He tried to kill himself on thanksgiving (thankfully did not succeed). He ended up having to drop out of college right before he would have graduated, moved home, had to spend years getting treatment and really altered those years of his young-adult life.
