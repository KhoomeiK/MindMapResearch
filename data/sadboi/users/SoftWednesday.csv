I‚Äôm not saying break up with your man... but, this is a red flag. Also, he‚Äôs nearly 30 and keeps washing his hands after touching you?? He‚Äôs acting like a toddler. Remember your worth! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

YES YOU CAN!) but we are not certified to help (well, maybe some on this thread are mental health professionals but I‚Äôm simply not..) 

You said you think you need to be hospitalized. That‚Äôs A GOOD STEP that you can acknowledge this. There are resources out there that will empower you. There is no shame in asking for help. That shows strength and courage. 

Sending you all my love OP. I know I haven‚Äôt met you. But I know the pain. It gets better. Actually scratch that... WE GET BETTER. WE GET STRONGER. You aren‚Äôt alone in this fight."

dating_advice,fn2po87,t3_fyzhbp,1586598248.0,"You‚Äôre not doing anything wrong! That‚Äôs super thoughtful of you. It sounds like you two have different love languages.

The 5 love languages are: 

1) gifts
2) acts of service
3) words of affirmation 
4) quality time 
5) physical touch 

So. From this post, I gather that gifts (and they don‚Äôt have to be costly) are your love language. Maybe now is a good opportunity to sit down with your partner and see what his love language is? 
For example, maybe he really prefers ‚Äúacts of service‚Äù and will go out of his way to make sure you feel loved by cooking a meal, or washing your car without asking (pulling examples out of my ass here but you get the idea) 

The point I‚Äôm getting at, is that we all express and are receptive to love languages in different ways. Communicate! You might learn something new about your partner! ü•ï‚ù§Ô∏è"
