ACTrade,fqzysav,t3_gluzx7,1589778868.0,I have a bluegill model. I’d be happy to let you catalog it for pink mini fridge.
ACTrade,fqzvv28,t3_glun0b,1589776659.0,Interested!!
Anxiety,fkazj3e,t3_fh30gw,1584022991.0,"My cat passed away several weeks ago so I know how hard things are for you. Even now I have insomnia because the way she looked at the end drifts into my head. It sounds like maybe you should take some time off school so you can fully process this. It’s important to take time for yourself so you can heal. 

Something that helped me was to make a garden outside the window she liked to look at. I also saved her favorite toy and printed out pictures of her (I was scared of losing them since they were on my phone)"
Anxiety,fk2wfbr,t3_fg3x6f,1583810812.0,Yup. I get super exhausted and unmotivated. Before my depression came under control i would get extremely sad too.
EnamelPins,fjvstpl,t3_fdxchz,1583630781.0,I love your collection!! Mind telling me where the uzumaki pin came from? I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Junji Ito pin
AskReddit,fjtqasu,t3_feuh1l,1583610039.0,Nier: Automata. It’s the only game I’ve played where listening to certain tracks will bring me to tears every time. And there is nothing else like it out there (besides Nier lol)
visualnovels,fj7ymck,t3_fbxvkr,1583101163.0,Full screen. I get too distracted by other things if I keep it windowed
EnamelPins,fingjt7,t3_f85zbt,1582562977.0,"Mostly Etsy but I have gotten a few from creators personal websites, storenvy, and local anime/comic conventions"
cats,finfpyx,t3_f8trzf,1582562578.0,"We found her as a kitten at my moms work 11 years ago. For most of her life she was very skittish and not very trusting, but she mellowed out in the last few years and became a lot more cuddly and affectionate. Her favorite things to do were grooming my dog, looking out the window, and sitting in boxes. 

About two weeks ago she was suddenly unable/unwilling to close her jaw. She had some previous dental diagnoses so we thought it was due to that and ended up waiting to see if it improved before taking her in. When we finally did we found out she had a very advanced tumor in her jaw bone that had developed in the 6 months since she was last at the vet. We didn’t want it to advance to the point where she couldn’t eat and was in constant pain (she was already having trouble) so made the difficult decision to let her journey end peacefully."
mildlyinteresting,filecyn,t3_f8e5yv,1582499683.0,This toilet has a very threatening aura
AskReddit,fik4hnc,t3_f87myj,1582472549.0,Because I’ve fought against depression for too long to let it win. I know in the future I can make something of myself and I can’t die until I do
CasualConversation,fik44et,t1_fiioa45,1582472298.0,You are so sweet :(
CasualConversation,fiinp22,t3_f80hj8,1582423661.0,Thank you so much for this post. I found out yesterday my cat has cancer and we have to euthanize her soon because it’s really bad. Been feeling the weight of the world ever since and this post gave me some positive feelings
CrossStitch,fi2ttie,t1_fi2r3wx,1582088916.0,I use plastic bobbins and write the DMC number in the top left but I will also put a piece of masking tape in the center of the bobbin and write the number on THAT as well since I’m so scared of the number rubbing off lol. I haven’t had a problem with them though. They also sell stickers with numbers on them.
CrossStitch,fi2tirq,t3_f5lvk7,1582088663.0,I love backstitching. Seeing the final piece “come together” is soo satisfying to me
CrossStitch,fi2t0yi,t3_f63pr4,1582088248.0,Wow!! This looks really great so far. Just from this photo it seems like the end product is going to be pretty big too
EnamelPins,fhyodiu,t1_fhycsc1,1581980163.0,"Justpeachy, I think it’s sold out though :("
aww,fho6pmv,t1_fhn93tw,1581743322.0,"I have one too and she’s the best. My current one is very intelligent too, but my last one wasn’t so I have no idea if that’s a breed thing or not lol"
Anxiety,fgebsk0,t3_exx6jc,1580695975.0,Yes!!!! And everything seems really loud too.
Anxiety,ffe2gx8,t3_et2bgp,1579834971.0,I know how you feel. I got my license in my early 20s but never really drove because of intense fear. Currently I’m 25 and just starting to really adapt due to necessity. Honestly when it comes to switching lanes and passing- I just don’t do it. I plan my driving routes ahead of time (using google maps) so that I am always in the lane I need to be in to turn.
autism,fevp06u,t3_eqprxz,1579399830.0,You can definitely have both. I have very crippling social anxiety and sometimes I think a big part of it is the result of me coping with my autism symptoms on my own my whole life (diagnosed as an adult) it really sucks
Anxiety,feo1ash,t3_eq2qih,1579293730.0,I swear my pets can sense when my anxiety is bad! They always come and lay around me
AskReddit,feo09my,t3_eq1wzh,1579293395.0,"I need to beat my phobia of driving, a good job, and for my generalized anxiety over everything to stop."
medizzy,f9w8t6x,t1_f9vr1u3,1575688867.0,I had to get my tonsils out as a kid because of this! I didn’t get strep all that often but since I was a carrier I was getting my parents sick all the time lol
visualnovels,f8tyyqa,t3_e1wy5h,1574814801.0,"Saya no Uta. Replayed it when the HD version came out and found it to be very underwhelming compared to how I remember it being years ago when I first read it. Still a one of a kind VN for sure, though"
GetMotivated,f7hveyx,t3_dw7pm7,1573748172.0,I'm about to move out for the first time and i really needed to see this. I have relatively severe anxiety and this is one of the most terrifying steps i've ever taken
visualnovels,f7gclqz,t3_dvnuzp,1573700242.0,Shirou from Dies Irae. He is just so badass. Some of the scenes involving him in Rea's true ending are 10/10
AskReddit,f4wknbx,t1_f4vrwb1,1571857127.0,"A few years ago when i was suicidal i genuinely felt like the few people in the world who cared about me would move past my death soon enough and that their lives would actually be better without me. Years later i realize i couldnt have been more wrong but at the time it was my cats that kept me holding on because i knew that i was their world, that they wouldnt understand where i had gone, and that nobody would be left to take care of them. You never know what will keep you hanging on"
