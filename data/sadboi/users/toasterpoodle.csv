One time I playfully teased her about putting too much honey in my tea while the same group of friends was over and it ended up being a huge emotionally draining argument that resulted in me needing to stay overnight somewhere else. If I had spoken up, I would've been put in a VERY bad emotional situation and I didn't have anyone there to back me up."
