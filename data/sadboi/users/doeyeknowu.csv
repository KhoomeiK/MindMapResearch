BipolarReddit,f7rl6lr,t1_f7rc7a5,1573983209.0,"Ok your reply just made me do a full body roll of laughter. My current doctor is legit though, I asked within the first visit (after explaining my history of panic attacks and that I literally just wanted something to have on hand when they were especially bad) and he just said OK without hesitation. I’ve been on the same dose PRN for 5 years. It’s great to have someone that actually seems to weed out drug seekers without just condemning everyone"
BipolarReddit,f7r20an,t1_f7qyofr,1573973422.0,"Yeah, I caught that too. Nice to find someone else who also has no life. 

But yeah, psychiatrists are really attune to drug seeking behavior. Also my doctor outright told me within the first session that he won’t prescribe Xanax because of the addictive nature of it over other benzodiazepines."

ShitAmericansSay,f7iz01i,t3_dw8u4j,1573767867.0,Aren’t human rights things that can’t be taken away from anyone? Because if you’re arrested or even involuntarily committed for mental health issues you lose your right to own a firearm. God I hate this country
tifu,f7fi0me,t3_dvra7a,1573679822.0,I loved you and then I saw your last edit paragraph and I fell in love. I have one friend whose daughter was fucking counting at like 15 months and talking way earlier. And then there is my kid who is 2 and refuses to ever repeat words once he says them and prefers using angry faces to get his point across
CasualConversation,f7dw9zl,t3_dvjx4t,1573633181.0,You’re either going to die or not.  I have bipolar and in my lowest lows this thought gets me to stop obsessing over the suicidal ideation if only for a moment.
BipolarReddit,f7d7skp,t1_f7d6ccp,1573609811.0,"I don’t let my anger out of my kid thankfully. I wait until kiddo is asleep and let in out in very unhealthy ways. And I’ve hated being a parent literally every second of this whole journey, I can’t go through another 2+ year period where everyday I’m planning on killing myself or just leaving my life behind. I hope things mellow out"
BipolarReddit,f7cyft5,t3_dvhoym,1573603000.0,"I wasn’t diagnosed yet, but pregnancy was truly the only time I was ever level without any medication or therapy. I don’t know what the fuck was up with that, but I know that I wouldn’t have been able to handle all the shit I went through at that time normally. Post partum and even now (my kid is 2) has been absolute hell, suicidal -angry hell. I’m getting my tubes tied because I absolutely cannot do this again."
