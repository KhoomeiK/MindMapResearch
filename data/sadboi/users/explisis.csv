bipolar2,f5i1b6j,t3_dniu28,1572209973.0,"I have BPD and schizo affective. I loved Latuda. I took 60mg every night and I personally felt a few days of brain fog, then everything was clear for me. I felt stable, calm, and didn’t notice a decrease in sex drive or anything. It made me nauseous though, even with food, I also found it made me tired, so taking it at night was a must. I have never had better success with a medicine! I felt my highs and lows were leveled out, less paranoia and anxiety, although it didn’t totally remove it."
