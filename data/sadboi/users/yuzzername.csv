NarcissisticAbuse,esgl5bj,t1_esgiz9n,1561956432.0,"If they haven't found a new supply who is a back up plan they will panic. I used to ask him when will he stop. He was relentless. I stopped him.

NarcissisticAbuse,esgkae2,t1_esgixl5,1561955622.0,By the time I was emotionally hooked he tricked me into opening up about things from my past I had worked so hard to be at peace with. I remember feeling uncomfortable with how he got me to open up. The way I look at it things now is what makes sense to me.... When he love bombed me with compliments he was saying what he REALLY saw in me. When he called me nasty names he was talking about himself. This isn't about winning for me but I had so much to lose if I didn't leave.
NarcissisticAbuse,esgimy3,t1_esgi40u,1561954150.0,I was doing great things before I met him. I felt confident and thought I would never allow someone to disrespect me. He found a crack and slithered in. I'm not the same. He's out of my life. I never lost myself completely.

One night I went through his phone which I didn't know how to use because I've lived under a rocküòí and that's how I caught him. Making me crazy was his hobby.

We didn't live together but in the middle of one of his drunken rages witnessed him pick her up by the neck and punch her in the face. I can only imagine what he did when I wasn't around. I did report that incident along with other abuse. I'm allergic to cats and didn't have pets as a child but she was my buddy. When he'd leave to work in the morning she'd climb into bed with me and sleep on my feet. I didn't know her before but if I was being affected in that environment I know she was too.

It's been sitting on my night stand for a few days. The ""addict"" part of me was still holding on to that speck of hope. Thinking of new ways to handle his mood swings, drinking etc. Today he emailed me and of course he ""misses"" me and wants to start over he threw in a jab of course and I almost threw up in my mouth. I didn't reply. I called my DV advocate for support and asked if she could go to court with me to have this stamped the judge. This isn't easy and it sucks but going back is not an option.

He was a lesson in life but YOU did all the work.

The truth is you're on your own. Reach out to a domestic violence advocate. Google the number in your area. So sorry that you're going through this alone. There's a lot a self defense videos on YouTube that are helpful. Most of all DO NOT meet him anywhere to talk or even talk to him. Law enforcement can only do so much and you have the right to protect yourself.
LifeAfterNarcissism,erw2u2w,t3_c416wy,1561331680.0,So sorry honey. They will punish you over and over for having a backbone.  The pain is horrible and you end up mad at yourself. We're here for you. No judgement we've all been there
NarcissisticAbuse,erw2601,t1_erw0wdj,1561331153.0,It's so weird. My ex told me he only said he loved me because I said it and it felt kinda nice lol
NarcissisticAbuse,erw1tle,t1_ervxrim,1561330884.0,"The reason I asked if he had a job is because of something that clicked to me one day. My ex was very verbally abusive. At first it was name calling and when I became numb to that he switched over to sarcasm and low blows. One day I asked him of he would ever talk to his boss or his boss' wife that way and he said ""no way that's my money"" 
So you see they clearly know what they're doing and see you as a love sick punching bag. Yes I stayed even after knowing that but I wasn't strong enough to end it at that moment. The day I ended it he went into a rage and hit me. I never thought he would and he did. He lost control of the girl who used to cry,  walk on eggshells, give in to sex, cook finger licking meals, stroked his ego, looked good on his arm while dying inside. My ex ""talked"" about wanting help even promised to go to to church (which was weird because he was his OWN GOD)  but when I mentioned a church or suggested a therapist he would say ""I'VE GOT IT""  Honey trust me when I say this. You are not here to help someone who doesn't love themselves."

When we post on here our questions or advice people give us their feedback and support. It's up to us if we take the advice or ignore it and continue to roll in the mud. I can't think of any narc that has ever ""changed"". I used to think my ex would someday see how much he's hurt me and have some miraculous epiphany but all I got was crocodile tears and backhanded apologies. Don't waste any of your time on him. Please work on staying away from him. He's not going to change."
NarcissisticAbuse,ervudua,t1_ervlfhw,1561325280.0,I lived it and will say Narcissist do not want love. If that were the case they'd accept it when it's in their face.

NarcissisticAbuse,eroxvsb,t1_erov678,1561092093.0,I know. It's hard to accept who they really are when they wear different masks. When you love someone you're genuine. No dramatic switching of personalities. Yes it's normal to express emotions but if you're home upset questioning his motives while he's probably eating a nice meal or sleeping like a baby then the answer is clear. His intentions were to punish you. You broke no contact and he sold you a fantasy. They take what they can get with no remorse. I know it's hard but accept that he used you and he's a monster. Protect yourself.
NarcissisticAbuse,eroxcyo,t1_erow7cj,1561091610.0,"Thank you for your kind words and support. Before meeting him I was doing great things. I had worked so hard to get to where I was. I never thought I'd allow myself to be mistreated by anyone let alone a man. 
I was a good woman to him and his child. I ignored some red flags because by then he had me under his control. 
I always knew I didn't deserve any of it. I never lost myself. I don't wish this on anyone it is too painful. Tonight I was allowing myself to feel sad. I cried but didn't break. He doesn't deserve me and I don't want to hurt anymore."

I'm struggling with the ""good"" memories but I have to remind myself how those moments were so because HE was getting something out of it. 
It hurts like hell but it's the truth. 
You slept with him from a place of love and hope. They do it for the gratification part...they pat themselves on the shoulder because their bullshit worked. It's nasty and evil. 
Cry it out and remember how bad this feels so when you feel like unblocking him remember. I've been in your shoes. Maybe even worse. My ex used to love bomb me and cry with me and kiss my tears away. He used to kiss my snot as I was crying and it felt like some soap opera shit. Next minute he's calling me every name in the book and telling me to fuck myself.

Police made him jump in and retrieve my things but I only wanted my meds paperwork and her bear. I lost a lot of stuff but that was the least of my concerns.

trashy,erawoax,t1_er9cywh,1560654787.0,"I've gotten shit for not ""blessing"" someone's sneezeüò©"
NarcissisticAbuse,eravwk9,t1_er7jz10,1560654232.0,Of course he would blame youüò© I hated walking on eggshells. What were we thinking?
NarcissisticAbuse,eravem0,t1_er89ax3,1560653876.0,You're in control. You have the power.
NarcissisticAbuse,erav9vt,t1_er8xrok,1560653783.0,"Wow! You managed to keep 6 kids quiet while driving so ""Sleeping Beauty"" could sleep? That is incredible. 
I think they sleep so much because being awake requires to live and their dead inside. It got chills hearing about your husband getting naked and taking naps...üò® My ex did the same thing. And God forbid I snored. But as soon as he would wake up it was as if I was in the middle of a Top Chef episode üò©üî™üçΩ challenge"
domesticviolence,er7ahxa,t1_er79s8y,1560572578.0,"You're welcome. And I speak from experience. My ex and I were addicted to each other physically but he was a mess. I tried so hard to get him to see my worth and he tried EVERYTHING to break me. I stopped leading with my heart and allowed my brain to end that toxic mess. The coward hit me because he lost control. Wondering what they're doing or if they're ""changed"" is normal but stay strong. Trust me they're doing just fine living themselves."
NarcissisticAbuse,er79rt4,t3_c0rty1,1560571817.0,Congratulationsüí™ Nothing positive comes out of sharing your life with a Narcissist. Starving them is the ONLY way.
domesticviolence,er79h79,t3_c0ssxi,1560571521.0,"Don't feel stupid. Feel proud of yourself. It's not in you to have a ""fuck him"" attitude and that says a lot about you. What good will come out of contacting him? He's an ex for a reason and you don't want to go backwards. He's still alive and enjoying his gay bars, girl he sounds like trouble. Don't do it. Not worth it."
NarcissisticAbuse,er73r50,t3_c0keg7,1560566026.0,How are you doing? We're here to support eachother. I hope you're feeling better.
NarcissisticAbuse,er73l7j,t1_er4x5vj,1560565872.0,You're not. The fact that you question says you're not. You're none of the things he's said to youüòâ
AmItheAsshole,er6zfvg,t3_c0ndiu,1560562139.0,NTA I think if she enjoys chit chatting she'll tame it down. I have a sensitivity to scents and I've had the scent stuck in my throat for the reat of the day along with a headache. Now I  either say something or leave the room if I don't know who it's coming from.
NarcissisticAbuse,er6yjl2,t3_c0n4n3,1560561347.0,I felt like that yesterday. If only I could see him and feel his arms around me and smell him I'd feel better but that's the addiction talking. Reality is they DON'T miss us at all. They miss the attention we gave them and the energy they sucked off of us to make them feel alive. It's hard to stay away from the person you love but the cycle will get uglier each time you give in and you'll start disliking yourself more and more. It's not worth it. It's okay to stay in bed all day. Its okay to cry. I didn't shower for 4 days and my hair was starting to dread. I seriously doubt they've missed a shower or a hot meal over me leaving him. Be kind to yourself tonight and hang in there.
NarcissisticAbuse,er6wyg7,t3_c0lfki,1560559952.0,"I'll say this for billionth time... They are demons who have studied the same Narc handbook. 
They will pretend to show interest in your stories/secrets and use them against you to make you crazy. I told my nex I slept with a married man (he was in the middle of a divorce) but didn't develop feelings for him. He then used it against me to try to convince me that I didn't have respect for myself or lacked integrity."
Heartbroken,er4ri2s,t3_botaxw,1560506527.0,I choked back tears reading this. Somehow the pain will not be as bad. We want to believe that but it feels impossible. Days feel never ending. Not hearing from them is a quietness our hearts aren't used to. My heart aches for you because Im on Day #6 and I understand your pain. I'm so sorry.
NarcissisticAbuse,er4q3v2,t3_c0gibl,1560504343.0,Bad idea. They will turn it around on you and learn new ways to manipulate you. Nope nope nope don't don't do it. You'll probably end up questioning if you are.
