The only reason I've stuck it out is because the pay and benefits are good and also because I didn't want to look like a job hopper.  Just do the best you can for right now and even though the current circumstances are not great as far as jobs go, keep looking!!  I would also let your supervisor know how you are feeling about the lack of communication and confusion regarding the reporting structure.  It may go in one ear and out the other, but at least you'll know you attempted to fix the situation.

 I had one opportunity come up about 3 months in and I wish now that I had taken it, but I was worried that it would look like I had taken a step back.  Trust me, keep looking because that type of environment will not get better."

I have been at my job for 10 months and I have hated every minute of it.  It's seriously taken a toll on my mental health and I wish I had started to actively look for other positions sooner.  All of the points you made are valid reasons to want to quit.
howardstern,fguptxv,t3_f0ako6,1581126642.0,I never realized he was this thin!  I first became familiar with him on MadTV and he was already pretty heavy then.  I wonder when he started to get fat.

My boss didn't even introduce me to the team until the end of my first week and only then because we had a team meeting that day.  My position isn't new, but the particular work they've assigned to me is very specialized and different from the rest of the team.  Of course there are no procedures or training materials at all.  Just like you I've had a few brief moments of thinking maybe it can work, but quite frankly I'm tired of being miserable at work every single day!"

BravoRealHousewives,f58rxg3,t3_dmzajo,1572062630.0,I think this is probably overall Shane's personality and he plays it up even more for the cameras.  His interaction with Emily can be painful to watch at times though.
BravoRealHousewives,f58qyru,t3_dn78pr,1572061999.0,Just yesterday Meghan was quoted as saying that she and Jim were in counseling but doing well.  I think she must have found new information about him cheating and that led to the big blow up.
BravoRealHousewives,f58l0cj,t3_dn2fve,1572058351.0,I think Teresa really started to feel hatred towards Joe after her mother died and she realized she missed almost a year of time with her mother because she was serving a prison sentence that she blamed Joe for.

Then I knew it was just a sexting thing.”*  Ummm, yeah I'm guessing maybe she found out it wasn't just a sexting thing and they had a big blow up."

I hate to say it, but showing up late will definitely put you at a disadvantage, but it's definitely nothing you can't overcome.  Just for reference, someone I know applied at my company and I overheard one of my managers say they weren't going to interview him this time because they remembered interviewing him 2 years ago and he showed up 15 minutes late.  So being on time really is more important than you think."
BravoRealHousewives,f52lqi5,t3_dmid72,1571951361.0,Emily seems to be in serious denial about her marriage to Shane.  She is constantly making excuses for him.

Eventually they transitioned some of her work over to me.  That being said, even now there are still days where I am very bored.  I don't think it's bad to look at the internet occasionally.  Maybe take some walks here and there.  I don't think it's bad to leave maybe 5-10 minutes early, but 20-30 is pushing it.  I would try to stick with this job, unless of course the new job you are being offered is superior in some way?  You need to be able to justify the short time at this job when you apply for other jobs further down the line."
