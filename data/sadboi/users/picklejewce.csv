castiron,fmuhzde,t1_fmrisk3,1586391778.0,"Sure. 
Let us come to room temp. Salt and Pepper generously on both sides. Score the skin. Start in a cast iron pan, dry and cold. Start heat on med/medhigh. As the pan heats up you can go down to medium. Fat will render, you want this. Don‚Äôt touch or move the breast for at least 4-5 minutes to create the crust. Check and you want it golden dark brown but not burned. Adjust heat if needed. Flip around 8 mins and cook on other side around 5-6 minutes for med-rare. Remove to a cutting board to rest. 
I then cook thick sliced potato chips in the duck fat because we don‚Äôt waste magic."
