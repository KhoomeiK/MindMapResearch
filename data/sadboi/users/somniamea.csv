BPDlovedones,fr54buo,t3_gmbxcf,1589902267.0,"My expwBPD also took our cats and said he would drain me financially if I tried to take or to court (lol he'd already drained me financially, so joke's on him?). I was going to do it anyway, because they were my cats god damn it, but mutual friends asked me not to for my sake. Those friends were also the ones who have me updates about the cats' health and let me know when one of them died. It still feels awful, I still miss my kitty five years later, but other than that I am so unbelievably happy and relieved that he's out of my life. Even years later I still sometimes am struck by how much happier I am and how lucky I am to have gotten away without any legal entanglements. His shadow will probably always remain, but at least I'll never have to see him again.

Congratulations on getting your restraining order, and enjoy your freedom be yourself again!"

BPDlovedones,fnl5sgj,t3_g23bnh,1587047544.0,"Yes!  It's something I've wondered about a lot. He honestly wasn't anything like any other guy I had been into before, or certainly since. Not physically, intellectually, or personality-wise. And obviously not emotionally. He didn't even share my sense of humor, which is very important to me. Our interests did (at least seem to) coincide enough for me to not feel too completely confused about what I ever liked about him (other than the completely fake persona he fabricated for me, obviously). But yes, whenever I happen to compare him in any way with my current bf or my other ex (or all three!), I hear ðŸŽµone of these things is not like the othersðŸŽµ."

depression,erm8p5u,t3_c2fuf3,1561010455.0,"Yes, exactly. I'm in a very similar situation. And I've tried to tell them, when things are going better and I can actually talk about it, that what they consider warranted nagging is actually hugely exacerbating the problem, making me less capable of cleaning or doing anything constructive, and more afraid to even leave my room when I'm at home. But it doesn't get through to them that they just keep reinforcing the spiral. 

Even more fun, at one of my lowest periods, I was having suicidal ideations, and my mother actually MOCKED me for it, saying through my door:

[Exaggerated whiny voice] ""Leave me alone, I'm going to kill myself!"" [Regular voice] ""Grow up, somniamea.""

Lovely."
