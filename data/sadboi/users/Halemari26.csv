BlackPeopleTwitter,er8nu3l,t1_er6hfxu,1560608379.0,"It took my boyfriend 4 years to save up enough to move out as an apprentice electrician, because his dad was charging him $600/month to live in a basement room to ""teach him about the real world"".  Even during times when my boyfriend was out of work (every winter), or in technical training, his dad would keep track of everything he owed and give him a fucking invoice for 3 months rent and other expenses whenever he got paid again.  

I LOVED watching them struggle with money after he moved.  They had gotten too used to that extra $600 cash flow and his stepmom had to come out of early retirement and go back to work.  FUCK shitty dads."

(No offense meant to the OP, I started at 257, so I was even more obese)"
