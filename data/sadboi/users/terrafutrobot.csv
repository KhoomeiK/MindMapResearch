BipolarReddit,eup5prj,t3_ch3u2m,1563951922.0,"Having a full blown episode is not the only way to say you are having or have had a manic state of mind. Keeping yourself in check is crucial to managing your mood and not letting it progress to that point.

If you care about the person you are wiyh now, explain to them what being bipolar means. I only spiral out into a full blown manic episode if I don't notice the mania before it is too late. Having my partner know the symptoms of mania is crucial to preventing it from escalating. The worst part of being manic is that you feel normal, but that doesn't mean other people won't notice it.

You seem to have some belief that only a massive episode qualifies as a manic episode. That is simply not true. I am hypomanic probably 60% of the time.I have to keep myself in check or rely on other people to let me know when I am letting it get out of control.

Sure, I have had 24 hours where I fucked my entire life up but there were warning signs leading up to that point. Being aware of yourself, in my experience, is the best way to avoid doing something you wouldn't normally do. Having said that a good therapist and psychiatrist is crucial for me. They have heard everything and provide perspective that helps you get to the root of the problem.

Read up on being bipolar. Understand who you are. A good friend once told me that being diagnosed as bipolar changes nothing about me, that it makes me who I am, that instead of thinking of it as something to be afraid of I should embrace it. I will never forget that conversation because it changed everything about the way I see the diagnosis. I never use the word disorder. It's just the way I am. Everyone else is just as fucked up as me in their own way so I take what I got.

electronic_cigarette,eq4a0u0,t3_bx23qa,1559772514.0,"Just take a bus to the nearest vape shop or order online. Beverly Hills can make their own rules about selling nicotine but it doesn't mean you can use it. 

Besides that, vape shops in ""high class"" neighborhoods are always over priced. I stopped at some random vape shop in a gentrified area and they were selling Naked juice for $22.99. In my neighborhood it's $13.99 max. The guy tried to sell me a 60ml bottle of something for $29.99. I just laughed and walked out."
electronic_cigarette,epyshxm,t1_epypp46,1559649683.0,"You can use nic salts in a set ups that are meant for a freebased set up. As long as you can adjust the wattage. I personally prefer a 70vg/30vg ratio juice with 3mg juice. Usually running on a mesh coil (0.7 ohm I think?) at around 35 watts and is ideal for me.

Having said that, certain members of my family dont know I vape, which are just my nieces and nephews. So when I am around them I switch to a salt and turn my wattage down to around 15. Get that nic fix really quick.

I personally think nic salts are overkill for daily use but they do serve a purpose for me, which is just to consume a lot of nicotine in a short period of time."
BipolarReddit,epp8d15,t3_bvf394,1559368256.0,"I had a hard time dealing with my initial diagnosis of being bipolar and a friend told me something I will never forget... ""This doesn't change anything about who you are. You put a label on it and now you're letting that label control you more than it was before. It doesn't change anything about who you are unless you allow it to. It doesn't change the way I see you, why would you allow to change who you are?""

I've said this same thing to a few friends over the years and it helps to pull them out of the dark. For real one of the most important and meaningful things anyone has ever said to me."
bipolar,ep3uxhj,t1_en51k81,1559029058.0,"Out of curiosity, were you raised in a religion that you are no longer a part of? I lie because I grew up as a mormon and had to lie just to get by. I hate that I still do it but it was just how I got by in life. I left the religion around 15 years ago but I still feel like I need to lie all the time. It makes life complicated because it is hard to keep track of who I lied to, about what, and why."
LifeProTips,ep3taly,t3_btqqyk,1559028294.0,"I went on a hike that was supposed to be 2 miles. 1 in and 1 out. The person I went with wanted to continue past the destination.

He was in much better shape physically and said we should continue. About 2 miles in I told him I wasn't going to make it back if we kept going.

Walking up a pretty steep hill on the way back my right leg just stopped working and I my knee fell directly into a rock. Pain doesn't really phase me so I just got up and kept hiking with blood running down my leg. Luckily my hiking partner came prepared. We used some alcohol pads, then covered it with cotton and taped it up. Never going hiking without a first aid kit again.

It was a simple hike with a lot of traffic so a 24 hour survival kit woudl not be necessary but his first aid kit definitely made the situation a lot better."
CasualConversation,ep2fkth,t3_btl4ru,1559007719.0,"Get a part time job at a department store. I worked at Nordstom and met my wife there. In my 4 years working there I saw at least 8 different couples besides me start relationships just by working together so often. I am not necessarily friends with all of them but I know of at least 4 couples that are still together 5 years later.

The store manager ignored it unless it caused issues. My wife and I no longer work there but are friends with her on Facebook. She always comments on our photos and it's obvious that she loves that she created a store where something like us could happen.

Also met my best friend there. We had a group of about 20 people who would go out to a dive bar if we were closing together. Good times."
bipolar,eowgwpa,t1_eovgbz7,1558909655.0,"For real. The one I was in they evaluated me, put me in a room with only 8 beds and no windows. I was extremely manic at the time and it felt like torture. Luckily the other guy in there was willing to talk which made it bearable. We could not go outside and I was fiending for a cig which was not allowed. Didn't have my wallet when I got out, no cell phone, and had to walk 4 miles home. One of the worst days of my life."
bipolar,eov7yqb,t3_bt6fbc,1558890291.0,"Cutting feels really good when I am manic. I do it sometimes when I am having a severe manic episode. I have no intention of suicide, it just forces me to think about the pain instead of what is going on in my head. This happens maybe twice a year. I've told my psychiatrist that I like to do it but that I haven't done it recently, which is a lie.

I went to a psych ward once for 18 hours and all it did was make me feel more manic. So I only disclose that I like doing it, not that I have done it recently. Being trapped inside a place and not allowed to leave is something I just can't deal with."
UnethicalLifeProTips,eoph86c,t3_bsgx7y,1558764056.0,"This happened to my dad once when I was a kid. Very small town and we passed by a yard sale. There was a 4-wheeler parked at the front of the driveway and my dad assumed it was for sale. He was looking to buy one at that time so he was really excited.

We got out and within 2 minutes my dad tells me and my sister we are leaving. We had found some stuff that we wanted but he was so annoyed he refused to pay for anything. That 4-wheeler was a gem amongst junk.

They lived in a part of town where you couldn't ride without getting pulled over so it obviously should have been in the back yard or garage. But they put that beauty right up front at the side of the street with no intention of selling it. This was a house I passed by almost daily and the only time I had ever seen the 4-wheeler there.

Edit: The owners claimed it just happened to be parked there that day."
bipolar,eofhc73,t3_bre4zw,1558534458.0,"I was admitted into a psychiatric establishment once for saying it was going to kill myself. I didn't intend to at all but I said those words while in a full blown manic episode. The cop who took me to the place told me I seemed fine but having said what I said, he was obligated to follow protocol. He really seemed like he hated the fact that he had to do it.

I had already been diagnosed as bipolar so when I got evaluated at the place I was sent to, the conversation was different than what I expected. The dr and I obviously talked about how I ended up there but we also talked a lot about my past.

His personal opinion was that I was not bipolar but that I had experienced a lot of trauma and emotional abuse throughout my life and it was subconsciously always making me feel symptoms similar to being bipolar. There is a term for it that I don't recall but is essentially a lesser form of PTSD.

I don't think he was wrong about that part because I've been through some traumatizing stuff, but I'm also definitely bipolar. I still question whether or not I am bipolar daily, not because of mentioned dr's opinion, but because I am bipolar. Thinking I'm not is just me hoping it isn't true."
exchristian,eo9bc69,t1_eo85ur4,1558387119.0,"Your family will regret not being there for you when you have the baby.

My (mormon) family more or less cast me out of the family after I publicly came out as an atheist on Facebook. Stopped calling or texting or inviting me to go to their weekly dinners. It hurt at first but I got over it.

Got engaged to my wife, who is mexican, which made them want to further distance themselves from me because not only is she not mormon, she is also not white.

Besides my sister, not one single family member even asked about the wedding at any point leading up to it. So my sister got invited but had a baby the day before and couldn't make it.

It was a beautiful wedding and my wife was posting photos on instagram and facebook. My brother actually had the nerve to text me and tell me I was a piece of shit for not inviting my family. It was a small wedding and I told him that everyone who showed interest in being there was invited and he was not one of those people, nor was anyone else in the family besides my sister. He responded with some racist remarks about my wifes family to show me how I clearly messed up by not inviting him.

They all had a chance to be at my wedding. We were engaged for 2 years. Now some of them post Facebook photos of my wedding like they were a part of it and they weren't even there because they chose not to be.

It was a secular wedding in the sense that there was no mention of god. My wifes family are all catholic and they were all sobbing during the ceremony. Because god doesn't have to define relationships in your family. Be strong. Your brother sounds like he would be a shit house mate anyway."
