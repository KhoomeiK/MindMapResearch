UnsentLetters,ewv2acp,t1_ewux6zm,1565797069.0,Thanks :) It will hurt but might as well keep hoping since I alredy like him too much and will get hurt anyway. I hope you find yourself someone who loves you to pieces and then back together.

depression,etuqj11,t3_cdgwtu,1563217954.0,I have not talked to my friends in a long time and I feel great. I have food and it's so good and some day I'll move into a little apartment and have a cat.

Anyway how are you?"
depression,es174zj,t1_es11hd2,1561490568.0,"Wow that's weird and so annoying. I had a good half hour ride home where I was holding back the tears the entire time.

I don't really have anyone else to talk to. I could talk to my parents or my sisters but I don't want to. It doesn't feel good to cry to my younger sister cause I'm supposed to be the older and stronger one, you know. And my dad and older sister don't understand. Mum... I'm just not comfortable enough. I have a few friends but I don't talk to them ever, it's just not something to do. I don't like to be social.

You're right, she just needs space. It's just weird cause usually she's a very social person and talks to me about how she feels. I'm pretty concerned. But it made me sad when I saw her talking to other people. Made me think it's me, you know? But it probably isn't, she doesn't hate me, I'm just an annoying piece of shit. Just kidding. I'll be fine.

Thank you so much, you don't know how much I needed you."

teenagers,ery5tkv,t3_c4sy2y,1561401084.0,"Don't do it. Instead make your sleeping schedule perfect and wake up at like 6 or 7 am, and I can't stress this enough EVERY morning. I've heard that that is when it really works. Like you're not tired when you wake up and you'll fall asleep at night. Seems like a dream that can't be reached but you might as well give it a try"
depression,ere5yiu,t1_eqrlhvm,1560774743.0,It hurts and only time will heal. You know what's great about that? Time will heal you. I could tell you to take a walk or a shower but I thinn the truth is that nothing like that matters right now. Nothing matters except for that you survive. There is nothing you can do but there's also nothing you have to do. Just get through this minute and hour and day. Don't even think about feeling better cause you won't. But you'll have to fucking survive.

depression,epyoae7,t1_epwdfp1,1559645941.0,"Thank you for commenting.
I have 17 plants in my room right now. Two of them are blooming. (Flex) It is really nice to be able to give something all it needs.

I have thought about writing to her, because talking is just really hard. I felt really invalidated in one point which didn't do great for my state. I feel better today. See you all tomorrow!"

SuicideWatch,ep0lpz3,t3_bjzs6w,1558977109.0,"I wish I didn't have my family or my friend. I just want to die but it would make them sad. Their sadness is keeping me alive.

Why do I want to die? I don't know. The pain, probably. I don't know how to live.

Anyway see you tomorrow"
depression,ep0aa62,t1_eoxza6z,1558972859.0,"Just today the most important person to me (after myself of course) made me feel like she doesn't care about me and she also ignored me. She is always very aggressive when I accidentally ignore her or answer in an inappropriate way. I feel very used, not understood, lonely and confused."
