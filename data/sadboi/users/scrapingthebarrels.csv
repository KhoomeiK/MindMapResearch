lonely,fqtoa8k,t3_gkran1,1589642865.0,"I have the same issue. Going on walks alone, visiting museums, cafes, (not to mention now bars and restaurants are shut down) has gotten old very quickly. Soon every place starts to look repetitive. 

Going to cinemas is a money pit and honestly it's much better to watch movies at home, with your own tea, going to bathroom whenever you need to. 

Cafes and parks make you lonely as hell with all the couples around you. Museums are boring when you visit them alone and have nothing to talk to. 

And I have never had the courage to approach a random girl in those places. I know I am insecure but I really don't want to be a creep or bother anyone."
