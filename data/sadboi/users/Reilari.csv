It sounds like you're nervous because it's new to you in a big way. Don't let that get in the way because if you don't at least give it a go, and not just a ""yeah let's see where this goes"" but like a real complete full-assed attempt you will always wonder.

Good luck dude, don't let your crippling anxiety talk you out of going for what seems like a really sweet, really genuine girl."
AskReddit,eo9bnam,t1_eo9a1vd,1558387353.0,"No, I remember quite well, my post was very little about marijuana, it's funny, for someone ""whose mother had been in the medical field longer than I've been alive"" (fyi, we all do you dumb shit it's pretty fucking common) you're not very open to medical advancements. I'm not saying it's a miracle cure, but to deny it has used is ignorant and dangerous. Mental health issues are an epidemic throughout the world, and we should be looking to all avenues of curing them. Psychedelics are an entire class of drugs that we know next to nothing about. 

Are there risks? I'm sure there are, but all drugs have their side effects, without more research we won't know when we can and can't use them safely, and it's irresponsible to not look further because there is very good legitimate research showing the potential of it. 

I'd genuinely like to know how I was aggressive from the start, that was simply a statement based on you using your mother who's worked in medicine as a source. I'd be willing to bet in has nothing to do with psychology, probably a nurse if I had to guess, seeing as how if she really was in medicine longer than I've been alive, nurses were by far the most common form of women in medicine. I'm sorry, but your mom doesn't know shit about how psychedelics affect the brain. It also means she was probably growing up right around the time of the war on drugs, when the government spread a lot of misinformation and villainized these drugs. 

I'm on my 3rd year of a psychology degree, and have written several papers on medical psychedelic usage. I'd like to think that I know a little more than someone ""with a mother in the field"" who seems to have no interest in learning about them (or others opinions on them) other than regurgitating their preconceived notions they've learned from their ill-informed mothers who are taking outside of their field and trying to get you not to do drugs."
