After ten minutes on an Alpha Stim, I would feel a little lifted; my mood would be a little lighter. But, I don't think I would rely on an Alpha Stim for my treatment resistant depression. A while back, I worked at a doctors' office that had several units, and I would use one occasionally to get a little lift. 

After I stopped working there, I did go so far as requesting my psychiatrist to give me permission to get one. She did, and I got one of the units; but, I did end up sending it back because I really didn't think it was worth it. 

However, note that when I stopped by the doctors' office I used to work at to meet a former colleague, when offered the Alpha Stim, I gladly put it on for ten minutes. So, if the Alpha Stim  was cheaper, or better yet free, I see no reason not to have one. I don't think it takes the place of ECT though, especially if you get ketamine as part of your anesthesia. ;)"

I'm probably over 25 treatments by now. But, they have all been unilateral. My doctor has been hesitant to give me bilateral treatments so far. Personally, I would just take the ketamine and leave the rest, but the FDA and insurance aren't okay with that.

This ended in a very bad time. 

But, these meds can really suck, and I can't blame anyone for wanting to stop them. I really do wish I could've taken a different path and prevented the hypomania and mania, but I didn't. It got very distructive. If you are for sure of your diagnosis, meds are a necessary evil.

I have only received unilateral electrode placement treatments. They focus on one side of the brain, and I'd say the memory loss has been very mild. Most of the cognitive impairment has gone away since my main series where I was treated three times a week. 

I have heard and researched that bitemporal treatments that focus across the whole brain causes more intense side effects. I haven't experienced any of those, but I think my doctor wants to go that route if I don't show more improvement. I may not go along with him.

Further, I can speak a little about ketamine as well. Since there is a need for anesthesia during ECT, my doctor decided to add ketamine to my anesthesia for my last treatment. Wow! Just 20 CC's and that day I was a little extra woozy after my treatment, but once I got home, I actually had a day where I felt normal again. I remembered what it was like to not be depressed. It was great. However, it did wear off, and I fell back into my depression. But, just that taste of normalcy gave me hope that I could get back there some day.

It's my understanding that much more ketamine is used in full ketamine treatments, but they aren't covered by insurance to my knowledge. Further, ketamine does wear off after a while and may not have a lasting effect. But, just that glimmer of hope may be worth it. 

I wish you all luck. These treatments are strong interventions and the best hope you have out there for treatment resistant depression. I hope they work out for you all."

EatCheapAndHealthy,fae1f8u,t3_e8oly0,1575991581.0,"Roasted brussel sprouts!!! My favorite recipe:

Take a big Ziploc bag. Clean and split the sprouts. Throw them in the bag. Add kosher salt to taste and pepper to taste. Add olive oil, or another oil she can have to coat. I don't remember the measurements and don't use them anymore. Then, shake until everything is fully mixed. It helps if you leave air in the bag. Pour out the sprouts on a foil lined baking sheet. Roast in the oven for about 20 to 25 minutes on 425. Check at about 15 minutes and stir them. You can add some salt if you want to as well. 

Some of the leaves will fall off and make crispy chips-- so good! But, the sprouts should be very tender and delicious. If she can eat pecans or walnuts, you can throw some of those in at the beginning, otherwise, the sprouts can easily stand on their own. 

I've taught kids and adults the joy of the brussel sprout with this recipe. I love them cooked this way. Be sure you get the crispy leaves.

bipolar,f9zal4v,t1_f9z7agz,1575740010.0,I second this from the heart. I wish I would have done this last time.
bipolar,f9unnxo,t3_e70ylu,1575654415.0,I have a serious problem doing this. I have to reboot my life every seven years. It's causing me terrible anguish this time and always does. I'm at the beginning of a reboot after a terrible manic episode and subsequent depression. This disease can be so hard.
ect,f9sw2pt,t3_e6s663,1575601957.0,I'm glad to hear it's helping you.
bipolar,f9svq0t,t1_f9sjol3,1575601715.0,"Your perspective here resonates with me strongly. I was thinking of suicide earlier today and had a thought that I might get stuck in some kind of permanent limbo. I am pretty convinced that won't happen. But, the idea of being conscious and not having the ability to communicate for 30 or 40 years sounds very real and possible. I've screwed up tonnes of things in my life, and who's to say I wouldn't screw up taking my own life. This is frightening. Thank you for sharing this today. I'm not the OP, and I'm not on the verge of something right now. But, suicidal ideation is a very real part of my life, and when I think of it this way, it puts me more on the side of living it out. I appreciate what you said."
bipolar,f9lci47,t1_f9l9k37,1575419740.0,"Every psych hospital I've been to in my town lets you smoke. You get two cigarettes each smoke break. I live in the South, but I've been to one in another city, and they did not let you smoke."
mentalhealth,f9isdm8,t3_e5a95o,1575344822.0,"Sounds like it would be a good idea to go see a psychiatrist or maybe a psychologist. You may have had panic attacks or the onset of something else. 

I'd worry about the thoughts of suicide. From what I understand, not everyone has those-- I do, but I'm bipolar. There are many medications to deal with panic attacks. I wish you luck, and I hope it stops happening to you."
bipolar,f9evnkh,t3_e4oz32,1575252767.0,"There is nothing to apologize for with a negative post. We have all been somewhere like you are now. I hope it doesn't spiral. I've got no real help for you because it happens to me too. Good luck on not getting stuck internet stranger.

Edit: Yes, indeed f$@k depression!"
ect,f9dhxgq,t3_e4n3po,1575233664.0,"My doctor said you may start feeling improvement after four sessions. I didn't see improvement until very late. I ended up getting 15. Now, I'm getting one every other week. It's helping me maintain. Sadly, the improvement is not night and day. It just got me above constant suicidal ideation. Good luck with your treatment."
bipolar,f9d8988,t3_e4kx04,1575231115.0,"When I took Abilify, I thought it made me gain weight, but looking back, it may have just been the depression. It seems like I always gain weight during depression because I comfort eat."
mentalhealth,f9bqjie,t1_f9bhatg,1575215330.0,"I've done it a few times. One IOP I was everyday for like 4 or 5 weeks. One I think may have been longer, but I'm not sure-- I can't remember well. Then, both times, I would step down to three days a week, then off on my own."
BipolarReddit,f983e16,t1_f982t8q,1575173474.0,I needed strong medication to stop the psychosis.

BipolarReddit,f97gwim,t3_e47kb8,1575165431.0,"I do sometimes crash straight into depression after mania. Particularly, this time. I had an extended period of mania this year, and now I'm suffering through an extended period of depression. 

By the way, meds for bipolar depression are hard to come by. I think there are only a few listed by the FDA. I don't tolerate any of them well, so when I was recommended for ECT, I opted for that. It's helped some. I've had fewer really horrible days, and I have been able to bounce back from negative thought patterns instead of being stuck for the entire day.

Good luck with your current mood-- depression is the worst. I know I lose all hope of things ever getting better. May you not get lost in the hole of depression."
mentalhealth,f96s1g1,t3_e43cvy,1575150971.0,"I've been to a few IOP programs, and they were mainly geared towards learning cognitive behavioral therapy coping mechanisms in a group therapy setting. 

First, we would process how our day or week was going. Next, the facilitator would teach some CBT technique. Finally, we would discuss the application of the technique in imagined situations. 

Sometimes, it would vary in the format because something would come up in the process part or the facilitator found something more useful in one of our discussions.

They can be helpful if you have a facilitator the group trusts and the members of the group participate. I've been in good groups and challenged groups. The better facilitators will prevent one person from dominating the discussions. 

A good group, with a good facilitator, can help immensely if you really put yourself out there. You have to really participate and engage for that to happen. You have to play an active role for it to be beneficial.

I found them better for recovering from an episode than the groups during hospitalization because you aren't forced to be there-- you can come and go as you please.

I wish you good fortune and healing in your journey."
BipolarReddit,f95quy2,t3_e3z465,1575133539.0,"Modafinil was fuel for my mania. I was acting hypomanic for months while on a very low dose of Modafinil. I was edgy and a little combative after a while. I stay away from it now.

Edit: I'm bipolar 1"

leaves,f91uxpq,t3_e31c8j,1575002061.0,"Your comment so strongly resonated with me. Thank you for this post! Fulfillment and Social life were the top two for me. I'm picking up the pieces from years of cannabis and alcohol abuse. Having to rebound from the trauma I put myself through is my next journey. 

I reconnected with family tonight, and I know it's because I didn't constantly feel the need to go outside find a spot and smoke. I stayed. I participated. Thank you so much for helping me reinforce the lessons I learned today. I'm thankful for you internet stranger!  Bravo!"
