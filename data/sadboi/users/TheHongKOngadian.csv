HongKong,fr1pcg8,t1_fr1eyo7,1589823671.0,"Well there you have it - your assumption that our shared culture / race is immaterial makes you overlook how we can be unified politically from both directions. The fact that we are fundamentally the same people means that we can still win by ways of cultural assimilation.

In fact I think it‚Äôs the only way we can win, because the protests have a finite timespan (measured by the media‚Äôs waning attention & our city economy‚Äôs patience), and that we overestimate HK‚Äôs value relative to the metropolises that have risen in Guangdong. They will never concede, because the economic cost of a rioting HK is compensated by the revenues of a compliant Shenzhen.

Yes, mainlander culture could sweep in from the North and engulf our Cantonese culture, but I believe our Southern influence can flow back up to them as well. You‚Äôve clearly never met Mainlanders who agree with HK‚Äôs position, but my friend, there are plenty here in my district. For reference, I‚Äôm near Lan Kwai Fong and have many friends from up North who agree.

We could build HK‚Äôs soft influence gradually again, in increments so that it doesn‚Äôt attract attention. Build back our waning film industry, use their stories / content to inspire Mainlanders in Guangdong. Build new media industries that could do the same thing in different channels.

Wielding cultural influence, not protests, could be a superior way to negate the CCP‚Äôs advantage in brute enforcement by competing with them on a totally different level. No matter how crafty the protestors are, it doesn‚Äôt look like we can sustain the protest for longer without compromising the city.

If we treat them properly, like true citizens of Hong Kong, then we have a better chance of influencing them to appreciate the finer liberties that our city‚Äôs political alignment also appreciates."

I am of Chinese descent and I‚Äôm proud of it. I won‚Äôt stand for fucks like you who inaccurately characterize my culture as one of perpetual squalor & barbarianism - We are not that. We don‚Äôt eat bats, we eat noodles & dumplings. Even the dog festival at Yulin (which you have spewed inaccuracies about earlier) is widely derided by most in Chinese society, including me. I believe that China has the opportunity to bring great change to the world if it can learn to work with the world - but for that to happen, the world has to work with China as well.

Where my pride has limits is when my own countrymen start to oppress minorities like the Uighurs. It has nothing to do with China‚Äôs development, so I‚Äôm struggling to determine why it all began. What started as a counter insurgency operation against the ETIM rebels has transformed into something far worse, and I won‚Äôt stand for it either. Just last month, I attended a solidarity rally in my city with the local Muslim & Chinese communities in response to the atrocities in Urumqi. That was the least I could do - what the fuck have *you* done? Started a shell account and accuse strangers of supporting genocide without knowing their contexts? Fuck you.

Be it Muslim, Christian, or whomever - I will defend *lives* , because I know that is sacred. I love my culture, but my own people should change before we are further demonized. Is that so hard to understand?"
