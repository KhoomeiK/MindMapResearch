Specifically the acid receptor of the nervous system. 2) there was a study done on this phenomenon specifically. They used rats and found (I’m paraphrasing a lot) that ibuprofen acts as an anxiolytic (anxiety reducing medication). The also found some connection to reducing inflammation in the hippocampus which is the primary area the underlies the development of anxiety. I’ll link the article.  If you are a science person it’s a pretty interesting research article. I skipped to the discussion and skimmed the abstract because ain’t nobody got time to read about their methods and statistics 

TLDR: there is evidence that ibuprofen does have anti anxiety effects.
