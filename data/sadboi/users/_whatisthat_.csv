But first for current diversity about 50k live in bozeman, another 17k for MSU, with a total of about 115k for Gallatin county. I would be pretty surprised if there were more than 500 black men and women living here. Just today I drove past a young kid on his bike and took note because it's just rare to see in the general blizzard of whiteness up here. There are maybe 10k population worth of minorities in Gallatin county, mostly centered around MSU so you may find the diversity you want that way but your skin color will stick out.

So history, Bozeman has pretty much always, with Missoula, been the liberal part of Montana since MSU is here. However, there has still been a lot of racism here. Most of it was aimed towards Native Americans. Even today you, a black man, will probably have an easier time up at MSU than some Indians will. But there has actually been a lot of Klan and other white supremacists stuff, not so much in Bozeman, in Montana over the years. Montana was or maybe still is a hot bed of hate groups according to the southern poverty law center. Many years ago Bozeman got its first prominent black family, 20ish years ago. The father was to be the principle of the high school and the two daughters would, if I remember correctly, be the only black kids in their age groups. I was mostly oblivious to what happened but even in my adolescence a few things got through. There was a fairly small but vocal opposition to it and enough people not comfortable with it that they let minority be their voice. Don't think it ever got violent or anything but it surprised me how much people did not like the color of someone's skin. Move forward and MSU has or at least did have a large contingent of Saudi exchange students. On several occasions, one being 9/11, there was a vocal minority and enough silent people uncomfortable enough with the Saudis to have calls for them to be sent home and some grumblings about of not mattering how they were sent home. Well if that history made any sense there is a definite undercurrent in Montana and Bozeman of racism that comes out from time to time.

Having said those things do I think you will run into any serious troubles more than a sideways glance in Bozeman? No I don't. There are way way more people that will accept you as you are or just leave you alone then there are that would give you a hard time. As others have mentioned being from California will be your biggest hurdle.

For as long as I have been alive Democrats and Republicans have openly critiqued their own presidents on big and small issues. For some reason Trump got a pass on this, at least when expressing displeasure from TS to NS. And not only that but a lot of what would have normally received a rebuke from the Presidents party actually got applause. So when something finally gets through the wall of support NS's take notice.

Seriously if Obama had suggested people inject themselves with bleach half the democratic party would be writing their congressmen and women and demanding they do something about it and probably marching on Washington. But here it's a pretty mild ""It was a really stupid thing for Trump to say. I am disappointed."" at best.

I am not trying to be disrespectful or preachy or ranty but what do you or TS's in general want us to do? Trump literally says one of the stupidest things, and pretty damn dangerous, I have ever heard or read a President to say and mild disapproval is the response from here and no repercussions will ever be experienced by Trump because his supporters won't take action. So ya I want to jump down someone's throat and kick their ass and waterboard them until I understand why TS's don't criticize Trump more or actually hold him accountable for his words and actions. Right now I feel like Trump has to actually advocate for suicide for him to be criticized and will probably now be let off by lots of supporters because it was ""sarcasm"". If I and other NS's got an actual stream of self criticism from the otherside and things that were not ok with TS's actually got through to Trump and there were consequences for him there would be way less throat jumping.

So how do you want NS's to react when criticism happens with the back drop of the last +3 years at our backs? I'll want to know why the event in question rises to the level of criticism and your reasons for continued support but I will do it in whatever manner is most courteous."

If the whole base flipped on a dime about covid-19 and the president followed without a thought to what his advisors were telling him before or after the flip is a scary thought. If memes from an uneducated, in the that they don't know what going on with covid since they don't get daily intelligence reports, mass of supporters is dictating policy that will hopefully save the lives of thousands and thousands of Americans I am scared. How is that not terrifying to you as well?

But I can't see how that is possibly true. There were no mass of memes being laughed at calling covid-19 a pandemic long before Trump declared he knew it was one long before anyone else. There were no memes about choloroquine being a miracle drug. And yet those decisions by Trump are being defended with such fervor. There were no memes calling for the pandemic response team to be dismantled yet it no longer exists and any suggestion that it was dismantled or a bad idea to do so is met with an impenetrable barrier of Trump supporters. Using technicalities and ambiguous language  from Trump to show that what he did and said wasn't what actually was said or done. If any Democrat was flipping and flopping so much through a response to a pandemic would you be defending them this way? How would you react to their supporters defending them so relentlessly?

This can be tracked to way before covid-19. Before Ukraine the Trump base was pretty pro constitution. Zero memes about presidents being immune to investigation from Congress. Even the slightest whiff that a democrat wouldn't follow the constitution to the letter would have been high treason. But Trump declares he doesn't have to follow the constitution and bam the base is right behind him. ""The investigation is partisan"" he says and low and behold the followers parrot the same line even though nowhere in the constitution does it give the President latitude to ignore any investigation no matter how partisan. If Obama had ignored an impeachment over fast and furious because it was partisan how fast would you have gotten your pitch fork? Yet Trump said it you and others lined up and declared this to be the one and only truth to have ever existed. Even if it completely contradicted your previous beliefs or even what Trump said 5 minutes ago.

His followers flip on a dime and everything Trump had said before was just to calm people or some other rationalization. He never thought it was just going to blow through and he was actually rolling out the most comprehensive plan of attack against it ever imagined and any evidence to the contrary is a lie. Just look at the travel ban and well that's it I guess but that's the most comprehensive thing imaginable.

If Trump can't do his job as you describe why not find a scientist or doctor that has the time to actually learn and understand the material that is able to stand in front of the country? And seriously shouldn't Trump, Pence, Dr. Fauci and a number of other individuals trotted out for these media events be doing other things like running the country or making sure the plan to fight covid-19 is actually working? It seems like an absolute waste of time for the top people on the country to prepare for and speak everyday.

By what basis are we gauging if something is bad? Just about everyone with the seeming exception of you asks is this change is bad for humans to continue living on this planet. If it hurts human survival its bad if it helps survival it's good. We don't really care if the planet will survive and develop new life without us because humans won't be there to see it. The earth has been incredibly hot and cold. On fire and submerged under water. Those weren't bad or good really because no human was around to label them. But we are here now so we label things that happen now as good or bad for humans. And guess what thing that hurt humans are predominantly caused or contributed to by humans. We don't blame sunspots or volcanoes on human. But hurricanes and tornadoes and even some earthquakes are caused or strengthened by human actions.

Really when mother nature does something it can be incredibly devastating but it's what this planet was designed to do and survive. When mother nature does something amped up by 10x and the 10x is human made the destruction is massive to the point of species being wipped off the planet that's an issue and that's bad. Mother nature possibly destructive but renewing good. Human fuckery bad.

Someone less prepared can do way better by actually showing up and using the tools they have.

The US had almost everything going it's way, even after all the ""reorganizing"" or whatever you want to call what happened to the pandemic response team, but the tools were not used.

AskTrumpSupporters,flu3tdx,t1_flu1xrr,1585494591.0,"From the comments of governors, even though its clearly a job of a centralized entity to make sure higher priority areas get priority on supplies, they have been trying to get supplies on their own. However bidding wars between states, which wouldn't happen with the federal government using the powers it was given for these types of situations and drives prices up, severally hampers states getting what they need. It is exacerbated even more when the federal government, seemingly at odds with the statement of states should get their own supplies, swoops in and buys the supplies out from under them. Also just a note but isn't Amazon in the business of making sure goods from scattered warehouses gets equitably distributed to households all over the world?

Its somewhat interesting to note the one place that seems to be getting all of their requested supplies is Trump's home state and the location of Mar a Lago even though it hasn't been on the front lines of the outbreak. It's also one of the states that has had the worse response to the virus.

Without barriers parts of New York would be underwater or even more susceptible to flooding then they are now. Let's go with you week change in winter. Do you realize how huge that is? The entire climate of the planet has changed so that winter lasts a full week less. The amount of energy that must be stored to heat a planet that much is astounding. And you don't think adding 3 times that much energy over 100 years is going to do anything bad? 

Longer growing seasons and milder winters aren't actually all good. They can be quite beneficial to certain crops but other crops and natural processes depend on cold dependable winters. Without those winters some highly in demand nuts and fruits are going to die out unless massive changes are done to them. As for long growing seasons those turn into death sentences for crops real fast if it gets just a little hotter and dryer. I attribute the bad and nothing good to global warming because all the good is at best transitory so 15 years of good wheat yields with decades or centuries of hard times for all crops following is not ""good"". And omg that is weather. A cold snap, which will always happen, is a weather event. Years of weather that trends up or down or flat is climate. Of course it will be cold or hot for a short period of time that has nothing to do with climate change. The trend matters.

What is your definition of ""fine""? At 7C° above what it is now almost no modern life could survive in it's current habitat. Tree in the amazon would have to migrate miraculously hundreds of miles north and south to find temperatures they could survive in. Trees don't have feet. The equator would be a dead zone with no vegetation for millennia till new life evolved to fill that niche. Plants in the north and south really can't go any further north or south so they die. Pretty similar for animals. The world would be fine if it took tens of thousands of years or more to reach 7C° hotter. It won't be fine if we do it in 100-200 years.

>CO2 is an indicator of other parts of globsl warming and destruction of habitat for plants and animals and even humans.

I'm trying to find where I said ""...a sign of everything going wrong..."" CO2 concentrations are a huge indicator of the health of the planet and how habitats like the ocean are fairing. CO2 level we have now for the plant and animal life we have now is devastating.

It's going carbon nuetral because of government intervention and pressure from those dastardly left trying to kill off all corporations but somehow actually just helping them be more efficient and sustainable. DAMN YOU LEFTIES!!!

AskTrumpSupporters,flrrgrq,t1_flrfxip,1585426286.0,"Does every change in climate need to be made by humans for humans to be causing this one? 12000 years ago lots of things were different so you can see the impact that a few degrees can have on the world. It's taken roughly 12000 years for the world to warm up. 12000 years for ~10C° change. That gives plants and animals thousands of years to adapt to new climates. In the last 50 temperature has gone up ~1C°. In 100 its projected to go up 3-5C°. Plants and animals are struggling with the rate of change so far what happens if they experience something twice rate when they are already struggling? Things die and die fast.

CO2 is an indicator of other parts of globsl warming and destruction of habitat for plants and animals and even humans. Just because it's a small portion of greenhouse effects does not dismiss its impact. Would you have been happier if I listed methane ppm or nitrous oxide ppm? Winter is weird in the US now. Here winter was late. Snow was late. Melted almost completely off several times in the middle of winter and left early. Not no snow but not the snow of my childhood and possibly a hint of what's to come. New York has flooded more often and more heavily from storms in recent years then ever before. Another possible indicator of things to come. What is happening that's 100% true is temperatures are going up and fast. Snow pack and ice everywhere is melting. Oceans are warming. Plants and animals are struggling. All this can be tracked back to the industrial revolution and temperatures pair very well with the increase in greenhouse gases of all sorts that humans put out into the world. Just because there is a cold day and snow in winter does not mean everything is hoax. Count the snow and cold days. Count the no rain and hot days. You won't like the trend.

AskTrumpSupporters,flr3cx5,t1_flqyuq8,1585412118.0,"At what level do you know about the intricacies of climate change? What level of scientific training do you have in what field? 

But first why don't we just go with personal observations that any non scientist can do. Generally how old are you? If its beyond 30 or probably even 20 you can answer this question. How hot was it when you were 5-10 years old? Compare it to the last couple years. Is it hotter? Have weather patterns changed? Talking to your parents, particularly if they are/were in farming in some way, would they tell you about different weather and growing seasons? Unless you are in some very specific places in the world it has gotten hotter over even a short period of 10 years. Over 50 years growing seasons have dramatically changed to the point of some crops not being viable and others needing to be planted several weeks late or early. Things that depend on cold weather like ski resorts open later and later and close earlier. Summer businesses are open more of the year. Now to get into things you can't generally observe without being in Greenland or hiking glaciers. The ice is disappearing. Glaciers that have been around for tens of thousands or more years are melting or gone. Greenland is losing trillions of tons of ice over 50 years and those things are happening faster and faster. Sea levels are rising and ocean temperatures are increasing. All of these things are happening faster and faster and can easily be experienced in a person's life time.

It gets hotter every year from my own experience. Growing seasons are continuing to change. Weather patterns are shifting. Ice is melting. Oceans are getting warmer. All these things are happening and happening faster just from a layman's experience and observations. I dont need to know the CO2 ppm or how fast China or the US is pumping out more greenhouse gasses. 

Climate change is real and is not stopping. If it continues the trend a layman can observe for themselves droughts and heat waves and stronger natural disaster will happen. I don't need a doctorate to analyze the data to know that. Being fairly scientifically literate I can follow the 90% of the analysis and have a great deal of respect for the 97% of scientists publishing in the field to be able to make sure the 10% I don't understand is correct.

I really don't understand how people can ignore their own experiences and ignore the scientists that have studied their field for years and pull a prediction out of their ass saying everything will be fine or even better then it was.
