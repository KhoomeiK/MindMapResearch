Monday- half price beer
Tuesday- half off bottles of wine and large hot sake
Wednesday- $2 off cocktails

There’s also a regular Happy Hour from 5-7 pm on weeknights that includes $1 off our rotating draft beer selection, $1 off house wine by the glass, and $1 off well drinks (I.E vodka cranberry, rum and coke, margarita, Long Island etc.)

Not to mention, our sushi rolls are bomb and we have salmon belly and it’s amazing! It’s like fatty fish bacon and it’s smoky and delicious."
relationship_advice,fgerzp6,t3_ey0g9k,1580707946.0,"Regardless of what he was trying to do, it was creepy and inappropriate and in this day and age every man should know to be respectful of women and their bodies and personal space. The smoothie thing IS fucking weird. Entering the room where you’re sleeping is weird. Touching your thigh is weird. You know what’s not weird? Calling out bad behavior and poor conduct. Bravo to you for not backing down and big thumbs up to your dad for having your back. His choices caused this huge problem. Not yours."
Cosmetology,eyrmsfa,t3_cyf7gp,1567372684.0,"Wanted to be able to take better care of my own hair and skin and to help others look and feel their best. Also, there’s no shortage of jobs and gigs like hooking up with some photography groups and doing hair and makeup or bridal or prom groups etc. just endless opportunities really."
depression,eyla92t,t3_cxbnat,1567179830.0,I find myself feeling guilty whenever I’m happy. Like I don’t deserve it. Or realizing ways I’ve self sabotaged bc if I have the control things are better somehow. I’m a work in progress.
socialskills,eyiphle,t3_cwlxux,1567105680.0,How I feel about myself doesn’t determine whether r not I am worthy or deserving of love.
Cosmetology,eyfbgum,t1_eyd69t6,1567046262.0,"I’m also 29 and just starting out but I don’t fuck with anyone at school, like I’m friendly and outgoing but I leave it at the door basically and focus and so far I’ve done pretty well. Of the 2 written tests we have taken I’ve applied myself and made top marks because I worry about ME. If those girls are too busy on their phone to listen to theory and the teacher then that’s their education they are squandering. If it’s disrupting you, don’t hesitate to make mention of it (politely or otherwise) or move seats. 

I’ll help other girls with workshops or whatever, but I just make sure I’m treating it seriously bc I made a financial commitment to making sure I further myself. Don’t let anybody get in your way!"
NarcissisticSpouses,ey16evk,t3_cuzyg7,1566691064.0,"Idk about the prostitution stuff and he DOES have her blocked so that’s really a matter of how much you trust his word and even so, maybe at least taking solace in the fact that she is blocked? Otherwise he sounds like a shit head in general. You’re supposed to build each other up in a relationship and provide love and comfort to your partner and for him to be so rude and hateful is what is TRULY DISGUSTING especially being the mother of his child and life partner of almost a decade. You can express your dislike or discomfort with looks and behavior without cutting someone down. You are worth respect, you deserve it. *hugs"
ACPocketCamp,excte8i,t1_exc9clt,1566159133.0,I think I’ve seen a King Olive Flounder in someone’s market box! Thanks
NarcissisticSpouses,evco9k5,t1_evacu75,1564419586.0,"Sorry to hear, but you’re better off."
raisedbynarcissists,etxha32,t1_etw5yhn,1563299320.0,"Totally agree here. And you can offer to pay them back. When you’re telling the story of your wedding day to your kids or whomever in the future, do you want to say you let him have his way or that you stood up for yourself and were supported by your partner?"
NarcissisticSpouses,etwnavw,t3_c2t415,1563278077.0,She could join groups on Facebook or go to local events or a number of other things if she just wants new friends. Everyone on Tinder is just trying to fuck. Chances are she is trying to set up a Plan B in case someone more appealing comes along. Does she open it and message people around you? Just be careful and watch for other red flags bc this definitely is one.
