It's frightening, disturbing, but also somehow deeply encouraging to have the confirmation that my intellectual fog is due to the illness. I see that I'm far from being alone, and I feel for you all. 

I have been unable to take my antidepressant in the morning from the beginning of my treatment, as I'm extremely slow to start the day and am never hungry - I don't want to take the pill on empty stomach, so I wait until the afternoon to take it with my first meal. I also never succeed in taking it at a regular time, as I am so disorganized and lost in my tasks, as well as trapped in my mind. I realize that can be one of the reasons why my treatment is ineffective. Same for the mood stabilizer - I don't feel like it stabilizes anything. I still have incredible mood swings. The only change I can notice, is I tend to be considerably less prompt to get angry, particularly at people, and have stopped to urge into conflict at the first opportunity. 
I desperately wish there was someone by my side everyday, helping me with every little thing, so I could stop being so distraught in the face of everything, in the face of life !
I am currently on a leave from work for weeks and feel guilty, and scared beyond words that I'm going completely off the rails and won't be able to get back to work anytime soon. I'm scared I won't be able to pay my rent, as the allowance I'll get from the health insurance won't cover my full income. 
I want to get up in the morning and go to work, I'm sick of doing nothing, but my current job kills me, as it requires an incredible amount of preparation and organization.

I want to fight this thing off, be able to learn again, to read again and devour books like I used to as a child. One of you guys mentioned doing puzzles and brain-stimulating activities as a way to make things better - I'll be a buyer of any recommendation in this area. 
I want to get my brain back, as stupid as it sounds. It's a matter of life now.

I'm glad I came on here to read this post."

depression,f2ao8mm,t3_dcoa7w,1570115771.0,"Turn that into poetry. What you wrote already is. Take something artistic out of it. Draw it, your demon.
I can relate to it all. I don't know how you gathered the courage to share that on here. I'm impressed by the move."
depression,f2aj02q,t1_f29kvli,1570113931.0,"I read your message a couple of hours ago and your line, «it'll only get worse if you don't keep fighting» had me get up and go shower. It might sound stupid but I'm sure you know how getting up and going for a shower can require an energy you don't have when you're so low. So your words had an impact on me. I don't even know you but I can tell you're a caring person too - haha.
So thanks a lot for cheering up the stranger that I am to you. And thanks for the journaling tip. I do journal already, but just not every single day. I tend to go at lenght too much when I write, so that too quickly turns into a chore for me. But I'm sure it somehow has a positive effect. At least for the future version of me, who hopefully will read that and marvel at the changes that will have occured.
I don't know where you're at right now mentally, but gosh, I wish you the best of luck too."
depression,f1xeodo,t1_f1riy9m,1569797346.0,"Agreed. I have a certain reluctance to pills too, so I always have them at the lower dose, when my issues are pretty deep rooted. I should agree on upping the dose to get more chances of having positive results but taking pills still has me suspicious."
depression,f1qdmir,t1_f1pluat,1569698621.0,"Yeah pretty much. I had somewhat more energy on it but it intensified my OCD. Couldn't sleep well at night too, most of the time. Felt like I was going nuts. Before that I was on Venlafaxine (Effexor), but didn't have any positive effect on it. So now I'm really hoping the Prozac will help !"
depression,f1pjdhb,t1_f1pfqi5,1569682009.0,"I've been on Sertraline for 5 months and switched to Fluoxetine just a couple weeks ago, can't wait to see the difference as well !"
depression,ewzcap7,t3_cqqe91,1565893998.0,"What a remarkable move ! I've had the same experience, dropped out of college within a year after my high school diploma, and struggled for over two years working my way through my mental issues - which were at the time undiagnosed - and a deep sense of bewilderment. After those couple years I managed to get back to college, though my mental issues were only starting to torment me and though I was years away from getting diagnosed. So all along I thought the only issue was me - just me, and not some illness that I have no control over. So you're lucky to be aware of your condition ! I ended up going all the way to the Master's degree, when I at the time only could picture myself getting to the Bachelor's and nowhere beyond. The way was paved with discouragement, thoughts of giving up because sticking to a plan and to any type of schedule was beyond me, but I surprised myself making it in spite of my huge lack of willpower, energy, and regardless of the countless classes (and even semesters) I had skipped... 
So big round of applause to you and I hope that you will hang on when the discouragement will come !"
