I've probably been depressed since I was 16 - 18 years old and I''m 28 now. Anyone who says that really has no fucking idea what they're on about."
SuicideWatch,fcoitr7,t3_efd5om,1577833283.0,"I get where you come from because I know my life will end from my own hands and is most likely to be at this time of the year. There isn't anything anyone can do to fix it either, I've tried medication, etc from doctors and believe some people are just broken. Mostly for me it's been 10 years of mental health issues and I don't see a way out in the future, and that's what I worry about the most. I'm 28 years old now and have been this way since I was 18, and I can't see how I'll go on like this for much longer. Some people are just unlucky in life and I guess I'm one of them. It would be nice if mental health issues would dissolve with a tablet but sadly that isn't the case. And the whole mental health awareness shit doesn't make a difference either (in my opinion)"
