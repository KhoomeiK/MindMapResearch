socialskills,fqsc8zr,t3_gk9c8y,1589603488.0,"There's this guy named M. In tenth grade we became acquainted from similar classes and some of the same extra curriculars. Until senior year, our conversations usually consisted of me asking a math/science question and him answering it or me asking a random question (like ""what's your favorite color"") when I went through a phase of asking people stuff like that. I thought that he found the questions invasive and/or annoying and thought that he hated me for being annoying (he never said this, I just hate myself and he seemed mature and responsible and that intimidated me). 

Senior year, we had lots of classes together and the same extra curriculars + leadership of these extra curriculars so we were spending lots of times together coincidentally and things kind of fell into place and we started dating. A bit later, I told him that I thought he hated me and he said something like ""what? I never hated you, I'm just quiet and don't go out-of-way to socialize a lot"" and I'm extroverted and he's introverted and I had this epiphany of understanding that not going out-of-way to talk to me wasn't the same as going out-of-way to not talk to me.

We became pals over time then spent time together individually and there was a shift to it. His eyes seemed to smile a bit whenever I would start conversations that became routine and then we started texting more and facetiming too. Then everything kind of fell into place."
