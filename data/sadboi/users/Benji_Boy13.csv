My big advice, show no fear!, act like you rule the world even tho you are struggling in the inside, this will get you far, look, A year ago I was convinced that I will never get a job, and now I do have a job in the thing I love must in the world and in fact Im getting promoted by the end of this month. All of that because what people see in me is confidence and security but if Im honest, Im struggling in the inside, but If i stop for a while and see what this ""fake"" confidence has gave me, oh god, that feels good."
