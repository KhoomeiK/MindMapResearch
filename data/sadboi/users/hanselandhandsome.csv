What kind of jokes? If I hear one of the jokes, maybe then I will view a different side... Until then, I don't see what the fuck is funny about mental illness or rape. 

But joking though... 
Why joke. Why not be serious.  If you're serious from the start, and no one helps you, keep trying. 
 
If you joke around from the start when there's NOTHING wrong and no one helps you... It's 100% your fault."

What I fucking SAID, was, LISTEN CLOSELY NOW.   If you need help, SAY YOU NEED HELP.  Don't make a joke.  Don't say you have something that you don't.  If you're not going to help yourself, no one else will help you.  Whoops."

Why the fuck is leaving a suicide note funny.. 
Why joke about it if you're not serious? 
You're taking away from those that actually need help. 

Yes, you can fake a mental illness.

Saying you have depression when you fucking DON'T, is ""faking a mental illness."" One bad day doesn't mean you're depressed.   I have had many bad days, some people might deem me as depressed.  I, on other other hand, just had a bad day. 

Everyone is ""bipolar."" & ""Crazy."" Like that's cute.

Oh, ""I'm bipolar.  I have multiple personalities."" 
Ok and why is that cute or funny?

Right."

When you joke around you're wasting everyone's time and when you actually need help, no one will be there to help you because you ""joked around."""

unpopularopinion,fmcf5fj,t3_fuah8p,1585944478.0,"Some teachers aren't teachers and don't need to be teachers because they can't teach. 

I had an algebra teacher who worked fast and would tell a student they should know the material. This teacher was more into talking about inappropriate things with the students and playing around instead of doing her job. 

I had another math teacher who when I asked for help, told me to ask my classmates.  My classmates didn't go to school for this.  My classmates are not my teacher. 

It's an easy job for some of them.  They're not there to help, they're there for a paycheck.  They can come to work, play around, pretend to help and still get paid."
