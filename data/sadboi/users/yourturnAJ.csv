They never missed an opportunity to take it up and look through it. They found out I was bisexual this way, and that I was on social media when I wasn’t supposed to be.

Don’t get me wrong, I think this should be taught in schools like the Vietnam War is, but not have the brevity of it amplified for long-lasting impacts (ie, better chance of remembering it later on in comparison to other subjects taught in school), especially since it risks dumbing down equally serious topics."

I lost my sense of self and any sexual desires, because I felt like I had let myself and God down.

However, this is the furthest thing from the truth. I believe that God wants all His children to be content with life, and I also think that sex is included in that. Whether you save yourself for marriage or decide to have sex early, you are creating happiness for yourself and (hopefully) the person you’re with.

AskReddit,f6fegm1,t3_dr680u,1572813470.0,"My boyfriend has ADHD. You can’t cure ADHD, but it can be remedied and it’s entirely possible to live a somewhat normal life. As of now, he can’t get therapy for it, but he plans on doing so.

What is it like? I’ll be honest, I thought he wasn’t being honest about the diagnosis at first. I used to be skeptical of ADHD and people who blame their behavior on it. However, little things about his mannerisms didn’t really feel normal. Fidgeting, being overtly sensitive to rejection, being distracted easily, that sort of thing. It was a turn off for me in the beginning, purely because I was ignorant. As time went on, I started to feel like this was actually something I should be noting, not ignoring.

It’s hard for me to understand what it’s like for him, since I don’t have ADHD, but I do my best to alleviate any agitation he has with himself and some of the things he does. I try to note everything that I should keep track of. He’s appreciative that I do this, and has expressed gratitude on multiple occasions.

I know I wasn’t right to distrust him, and that being closed minded initially almost ruined the entire relationship. However, it’s gotten better, and I understand him a little more.

It’s a process, being with someone who has ADHD, but it’s worth it. I love him and it doesn’t change anything for me."
AskReddit,f6fd3zr,t3_dr61vh,1572813022.0,"Alright, imagine this:

The table is nicely set up and has rose petals circling the perimeter, leading to the front door when your SO arrives home. The lights are off and there’s candles scattered about. Dinner is freshly made; it’s something you both like. There’s soft classical music in the background. You have a glass of red wine together, and talk for a solid hour or so. Dinner ends, you and your SO clean up, and you slow dance in the living room for a while. The night winds down with a movie you both like, and fall asleep in each other’s arms.

Is it cheesy? Yes, but is it romantic? Absolutely."

I had something similar happen to me a week ago, not long enough to be posted into this sub, but it almost ruined the entire campaign and split the group. The amount of shame I felt in my own campaign was monumental, and I can relate to your stepdad - along with many others here.

Try seeing if you can find some better players with your dad who will respect his creation. That way, you two can still spend time together, and get more people (who care) interested."
