You’re describing fearing being locked in from ALS while also saying that every day you’re isolating even more. This is the thing we do to ourselves - we turn ourselves into living zombies, making our own fears into a fake reality, so afraid of death that we just stop living. 

I totally understand where you’re coming from. I’ve been dealing with this for 14 years. So many panic attacks. So many calls to 911 and trips to the ER. So many medical tests. All to tell me that I’m completely healthy and normal. 

The only thing that has consistently helped is to take charge. Get angry, stand up, and yell NO! I will not be subjected to this mental abuse any longer!

You have to say FUCK IT and go live life. Tell yourself - I don’t care about these thoughts, I’m going to move on and live my life. 

Tell the fears - fuck you, I’m going to do what I want to do. 

Tell the imagined sicknesses - if you’re going to kill me, then fucking do it, meanwhile I have stuff to do. The thing is, THEY WON’T. Because they’re fake. Imaginary. They. Do. Not. Exist.
