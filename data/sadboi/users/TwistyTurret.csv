I totally understand where you‚Äôre coming from. I‚Äôve been dealing with this for 14 years. So many panic attacks. So many calls to 911 and trips to the ER. So many medical tests. All to tell me that I‚Äôm completely healthy and normal. 

The only thing that has consistently helped is to take charge. Get angry, stand up, and yell NO! I will not be subjected to this mental abuse any longer!

You have to say FUCK IT and go live life. Tell yourself - I don‚Äôt care about these thoughts, I‚Äôm going to move on and live my life. 

Tell the fears - fuck you, I‚Äôm going to do what I want to do. 

Tell the imagined sicknesses - if you‚Äôre going to kill me, then fucking do it, meanwhile I have stuff to do. The thing is, THEY WON‚ÄôT. Because they‚Äôre fake. Imaginary. They. Do. Not. Exist.
