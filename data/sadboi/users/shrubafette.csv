Maybe muzzle the dog around the house more and get him to work with a trainer!

Call or text a close friend just for a small chat if you can, being around genuinely caring positive people really helps lift my mood. Avoid toxic people at all cost that will invalidate you and your condition.

Some main title games were good but a lot of them once traded in would sit on the shelf forever.

Duke nukem was a nightmare release, so many people returned it the next day cause it was so bad and a lot of the old ea sports games would basically rot. No one really brought in old consoles either.

Wasnt a friendly joking kind of thing or an intentional aggressive thing to piss me off purposely it was sexually aggressive and intentional. No idea who she was and asked her to fuck off a few times she finally did. Saw her bouncing around the bar trying to do it to other girls. A little flirtiness is okay but that was sexual preditor status


Also went out for beers one night with my boyfriend and some acquaintances. There was a young girl like 19 there freshly legal to drink and we're all over 25. I felt bad for her but didnt want to try to comfort her because i didnt want her thinking I was also some sexual lesbian preditor too like the other girls. Some of the girls were very aggressive in hitting on her and made her so uncomfortable she cried and hid in the bathroom. The guys took the older girls outside so she would have some space. These same girls rubbed up on me and tried to get me in a 3some before so I knew the feeling but being so much younger that's so much more uncomfortable and she was TINY and outnumbered by these other girls not to mention naive. Made me livid how they preyed on that and said something to them at some point. She was fine after and just stuck with one of her guy friends there and played pool to calm down before I left. She said she felt safe enough otherwise I wouldnt have.

Nobody really gets how that affects your body they just think ""oh you have to watch your sugars"" (it affects your nerves and you get pins and needles and numbness, and can cause the deterioration of some vital organs, for my dad it's his brain) 

 A year ago he went to bed I checked his sugars, lower but still good enough for the morning. I came back 2 hours later. There was shit all over the room cause his low blood sugars and medication made him lose bowel control and his insulin wasn't doing its job yet to keep his sugars at a good range(slow acting). 

The bed was pushed away from the wall with him under it wailing random words in confusion. The fan in the room was broken. I called my uncle to help me clean him and called paramedics. They checked his blood and his sugars were at a 1, for diabetics an acceptable range is around 5ish from what I remember and for regular people I believe is 7? Either way his extreme highs of 33 in the morning and lows of 1 at night caused this reaction to happen and I nearly lost him for good. Realistically he should either be dead or in a coma. I've had him fall in drunken stooper or other silly things when I was younger, but this was by far the most shocking and heartbreaking. I felt helpless af and I'll never forget the lost look in his face and the sound in his voice he was so far gone and probably closer to death than I thought and it was terrifying (I wasnt living at home and my mom works a lot and he hides it well when he doesnt feel well or gets worse) this was the beginning of his transfer to a care home and is now stable but his short term memory will never be the same. The nurses that care for him are so caring and hard working and I'm forever grateful because after that experience I dont know how they do it. 

Any nurses that may on the off chance read this I appreciate you and the long hours you work."

AskReddit,f5wsag8,t3_dp6uxu,1572529722.0,"Met my boyfriend about 10 years ago through a friend. Didnt keep in touch then but bumped into eachother at our mutual friends wedding.

I didnt get the full detailed invite rather just a heads up on where to meet and it ended up being a camping optional wedding which I wasnt told. 

Boyfriend drove us to the campsite and when I found out about the camping optional he shared his beers and let me sleep in his car with him.
 
We were so hungover on the way back the next day he puked when we stopped at mcdonalds about halfway, but that still didnt stop me from spending the next 24+ hrs at his house after that and 2 months later we started dating."
vancouver,f5pilmg,t3_doa8im,1572360255.0,"McClure's is probably the worst of them all. Every driver I had with them either took a longer route, argued about where construction was only blocks from my house at the time (that I had just passed that morn. And clearly wasnt done) I've had them just be flat out rude and short for no reason. And one time the guy wouldnt go the way I asked and raised his voice at me so I refused to pay. My friend was threatened by a yellowcab and was told her head would be cut off in his country, and they're just as bad in the suburbs when it comes to comfort and safety. Boyfriend took a belair taxi and told the guy to pull over and let him out having to call another cause he was driving like a mad man and speeding and there was no way his young kid would be riding in that car. It's so out of.hand and I think that people either dont complain enough because of phone wait times when its busy or these companies next to ignore those complaints. Something needs to happen for sure."

funny,f2yssae,t1_f2xw1n2,1570497597.0,"What I said makes far more sense than this post. Dear lord üôÑ

You're right murder is murder. I never said one was better than the other. Just simply stated the fact it's easier and far more likely to cause more harm with a gun than a hand wielded weapon. 

Second how do you know this man has training? Do you know him? Is he a police officer? How do you know this man's weapon is legal and he actually went through the concealed carry liscencing process? How do you know what state he is from and if hes legally allowed that? Your argument has no backing so I have no idea what you're trying to prove with that one. Also that made up scenario you just threw in there is pointless because its quite obvious a moron with no gun training shouldnt have a gun. 

And I agree with you on how to 'fix the problem' as I stated most of these laws we have all over Canada and shootings are rare hm coincidence? Alongside every other country and state with similar laws. 

And while in most states you're right you cant just walk around with a fully stacked put together gun but what about that college girl that paraded her rifle around campus? Did she break the law? Cause nobody stopped or arrested her... so it must be legal in some states to waltz around with a gun so you're kind of contradicting there.. 

we can talk about hypothetics all damn day long but the facts still remain. Where there's looser gun laws there's more access and more gun related violence that could be completely preventable. Where there's more strict guidelines on owning firearms there's far less preventable incidences. You're all over the place with your argument I have no idea based on half the shit you said what the fuck you're even trying to defend or prove?  And I'm perfectly okay being an ass, again sit back down on yours üòò regardless of this argument most of what you said seems to be mostly in agreement with what I've said? So I really again have no fucking clue what it is you're trying to do here but have a nice day :D ‚úå"
funny,f2xqz2a,t1_f2x4jtm,1570481511.0,"I'm sorry but a knife only kills one person at a time. Eliminating how easy to access a gun it is decreases the chances of multiple people dying or getting injured because most guns can shoot off multiple rounds at a time potentially killing 5+ people in a matter of a seconds. A knife or a hammer etc. cant fucking do that unless you're literally throwing handfuls of ninja stars. And I live in Canada, Those are pretty much our exact conditions for obtaining firearms. You need a liscence a mental health check (signatures from multiple people saying you're known to be sane) etc limits on how much ammo you can bring out at a time, when and where you can bring these guns etc. This is why theres far more shootings in the us than anywhere where theres proper firearm restrictions and your so called firearms training is not mandatory for getting one there. So just sit back down please and thank you."
