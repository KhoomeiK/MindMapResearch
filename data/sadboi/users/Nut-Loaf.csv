CapitalismVSocialism,fle79cd,t1_fle1h9a,1585078912.0,"I consider central banking and government intervention distinct from capitalism because I do not believe these entities should intervene with the market. I don’t even think central banking should exist. I believe in Austrian economics, so my view of capitalism is not completely the system we see today in modern United States. It’s not that I misunderstand the capitalist price system. My view of how the capitalist price system should operate is different. I think that the government should not intervene because freer markets births competition which then fuels the wealth of the economy. 

The price system is not irrelevant at all, because the price system has a large impact on how they affect wages. The relationship is mutual or vise versa. Moreover, the price system affects the consumer as well. I do not you don’t understand these principles, but I think you misunderstand the big picture of these principles. It is good to have the paradox that exists because it allows people to purchase products that are essential to human life at a fair price. Capitalism cannot disregard labor value as important because that is a necessary component that must be reasonably satisfied to be efficient. If business people purposely paid their workers less than what the market determines (exploitation), people would not want to work for that business and other businesses would compete to hire people for better wages. 

The good of all of this is that it furthers the prosperity of society and allows people’s freedom to be protected. Most people desire freedom and independence, and I believe that these are necessary to contribute to the happiness of society. Do I think the capitalism that operates today is effective? Partially, because people still have relative equal opportunity and still can be successful. Do I think it is the most effective system? No, I think capitalism can be a lot more effective if the system is completely free from the government’s hands. 

The point is that capitalism is an economic system that works to maximize output with the least amount of input needed to satisfy both the worker and the market. The end goal for society with this system is to protect the individual and their liberty and satisfy their own ends."
CapitalismVSocialism,fldzvwb,t1_flds8vc,1585074949.0,"“As a system, it has not care or regard for labor beyond that of it being a marketable commodity, hence, why it is capable of such absurd human atrocity with respect to labor.” I do not believe that capitalism disregards labor as only a marketable commodity. The reason why wages of certain institutions are small is not a result of capitalism, but rather a result of central banking (government intervention). Central banking influences interest rates and monetary inflation, which can cause prices to rise and thus negatively affect the wages of certain institutions. This is usually because our government has a Keynesian view of the economy and thinks demand runs the economy as its own variable. I believe your observation is not the representation of capitalism, rather it is government intervention. 

As for your argument about “essentials”, you seem to view the contradiction of prices of essentials to essential workers as an immoral thing. However, I think you misunderstand the capitalist price system. When the wages of essential workers are risen simply because they are essential workers, let’s say water companies, the water companies raise their prices. That would cause the price of water to rise and make it more difficult to purchase water. We could force companies to pay certain wages and also force them to have specific prices, but that leads to a high risk of water companies going bankrupt. 

This paradox of value is good, because if we were to force a high value on essentials simply because their essential and not based on scarcity, that would lead to essentials being more difficult for people to purchase. When the supply is high, the demand is low which creates lower prices. 

I think that contradiction is not necessarily bad. When it becomes a problem is when the discrepancy between prices and wages becomes too great. But then you have to ask why this is happening, and the answer is not based on an observation. The answer lies in the analysis of the market and the central bank."
CapitalismVSocialism,fldo0vx,t1_fldn0rr,1585068348.0,"True, it is more accurate to say that my perspective of a living wage is relative. I’ll concede to that. 

As with the value of someone’s work, I made an error in one of words. “Capitalist” was supposed to say “capitalism.” And yes, I know that Marx believed what you said about capitalism was what he believed the system of capitalism was regarding the labor value of a person. I probably should have worded my response better. I just woke up so I’m a bit tired lol.

CapitalismVSocialism,fldlzf9,t1_fld7eoc,1585067201.0,"It’s fine for you to believe this, because a living wage isn’t the same across everyone. You can have r this perspective of a living wage where all of these things that you have listed are required for you if you have a living wage"
CapitalismVSocialism,flce381,t3_fnx6ja,1585027561.0,"I respond with a question: How do you determine the value of someone’s work? And also what defines a living wage? The answer to these questions are not simple because in a capitalist society, they’re not determined by some guy looking over the market and writing numbers down. From the capitalist perspective, multiple factors create the value of someone’s work. And a living wage is subjective. What people need or want in order to make a living varies from person to person. Sure, sustenance is one thing but people still have wants and other needs that not every person has. 

Back to the value of the worker. Capitalists believe the value of the worker is subjective and determined by wants, scarcity, and supply and demand. When someone works for Walmart and makes $15 an hour, some might think that’s ridiculous and Walmart should pay the workers more for how much they make. But the focus is not really about how rich Walmart is. It’s about the demand for those jobs. The demand isn’t that high considering almost anyone can work for Walmart and put things in bags and be a clerk as long as you know basic math. In my opinion, I don’t consider these “essential jobs,” but to some maybe it is. In that case, this is where the paradox of value comes in. 

The paradox of value demonstrates that water is essential to life yet it is fairly cheap. However, a diamond is expensive and hard to pay for. Similarly, it is essential to some that people should be clerks that work at Walmart and put your items in bags, but because there is such a high amount of people who can and will work for Walmart, the wage is very small. But if someday almost everyone decides not to work for Walmart and there are very few clerks, there will be a high demand for them and thus cause Walmart to raise their wages. The point is that wages are not simply determined by exploitation and capitalist pigs; they’re determined by the market and scarcity."
CapitalismVSocialism,flccat6,t3_fnpn5t,1585025911.0,"I agree with your argument that it seems ridiculous for someone to pull this off in a “theoretical society.” Certainly no business person is going to think exploiting others with the potential threat of being rundown is a smart choice. Moreover, who would voluntarily accept a contract with a business person like that? 

However, I think you are missing the essential purpose behind the capitalist argument. Although he (I’ll use he for simplicity) recognizes that this case is extreme and it most likely would not work well, his point is to question where we draw the line on liberty. Do we infringe upon that business person’s freedom for choosing to exploit his workers? Or do we let the choices of the individual (within law of course) and market decide the fate of that business? 

Personally, I would use the example of a business person who has arbitrary prejudices, and so they pay a certain group less. Do we let that business continue despite the discrimination or should social action be taken? Although the first case is extreme, it still is presenting the point of the boundaries of freedom."

Moreover, viruses like these are nearly impossible to prevent from spreading globally. COVID-19 is another strain of the flu, an illness the world experienced every year. People die from the flu every year at higher numbers than COVID-19, and is this how we should respond every time it comes up? What good do all these extreme measures have besides destroying the global economy and doing very little in preventing an inevitable virus from spreading? 

Needless to say, isolation is an extreme measure to take in preventing infection. Whereas staying clean and healthy has better results. Who else is responsible for that none other than the individual?"
unpopularopinion,fl2qon7,t1_fl2or52,1584757475.0,"True, the chances of getting the virus may be higher than getting robbed or stabbed on the sidewalk. But here is something to think about: 1.25 million die each year from car crashes. That means about 3827 die every day from a car crash, many of which are due to collisions and drunk driving. Is it fair that you, a responsible driver I hope, die because some asshole drove irresponsibly and killed you? No it’s not fair at all! But things like these happen every day and every time you go driving, you have that risk of that happening. But you take a risk because you feel experienced, you’re a good driver and feel prepared. More importantly, you have responsibilities that you feel are essential for you to do. 

This altruistic attitude that we need to care more about others to prevent the propagation of capitalism is what leads to societies like China. The Chinese government thinks they know better than the 98%, yet their government is extremely corrupt and their people suffer from a lack of liberty.

unpopularopinion,fl2nggz,t3_fk6141,1584755218.0,"The U.S. federal and state governments should not have taken extreme measures on the coronavirus. 

I understand that this virus is dangerous to certain individuals and is spreading at an alarming rate. Furthermore, it is an illness that nobody wants to deal with. However, it is inevitable that the world must face this virus just like many other viruses we deal with every year. No one wants to get sick, but why must the responsibility of combating this virus be upon the government rather than the individual? A person takes a risk everyday leaving their house. Whether they are going to go drive their car or possibly get murdered. But we take risks like these everyday. So why must we treat this virus any different? 

People have jobs, people have families to take care of. Some people are willing to take risks to fulfill these responsibilities. If people are so worried about getting sick, then THEY should isolate themselves, not the whole population. All of this quarantining will most likely bear no effect on the rate of the virus infecting people since every country and state is infected. 

The point is that pandemics should have no effect on the decentralization of government and the promotion of liberty. Let people take their risks and let people isolate themselves. It does no good to anybody if the government prevents EVERYBODY from carrying out their jobs and responsibilities."

EatingDisorders,f4jjddg,t3_dkr8bv,1571620632.0,"The behaviors men and women with an eating disorder express are relatively consistent, so I think there is no worry there. You should avoid downplaying his anxiety and simply give him something to eat or tell him to eat something. Your boyfriend is not choosing to have anxiety over food and it is more complex than simply asking him to eat something (e.g. telling a depressed person to stop being sad). You should also *be careful* about your compliments towards him if they are related to his physical appearance. In other words, avoid saying he looks thin or bigger (like bulkier). Even if they are well-intended, such compliments might feed into his negative thoughts. 

In order to be supportive, you need patience. Eating disorders are difficult to handle and you may need to endure the difficulties with him. When you encourage him or compliment him, say things that build his character and focus on his personality. After all, it is a mental disorder and encouragement can help improve his mindset. Also, please take of yourself. Be patient and be there for him when you can, but be sure to take care of yourself and show yourself some love. Encourage him to seek help with his eating disorder and maybe you can see a counselor to help you be informed and show your support."

When you exercise or workout, make sure to eat something afterwards. Rather than losing weight, you will stabilize your weight and will build muscle as well. This means having protein rich food or drinks. Along with carbs. You don’t need to have a massive amount though (I have to because my metabolism is through the roof lol). As for coping, I would talk to your therapist about that. They would probably think of good thought strategies to help you avoid being caught in a negative view of yourself and relapsing."
EatingDisorders,f41zxiz,t1_f41fi6f,1571325835.0,"There’s one based in Seattle called the Emily Program. You would have to most likely make a driving trip to get treatment. As for your situation, I completely understand what you’re saying. I had a friend of mine who went to college with an eating disorder. She was extremely intelligent and was majoring in math. Unfortunately, she struggled with depression that caused her to fail most of her classes. But the reason she had depression was because of her ED. Her friends were trying to convince her to seek help for her ED, but she refused and thought because she was at a healthy weight, she didn’t need treatment. She would have her good days and be very positive about herself, but for the most part, her ED would take over and cause her to engage in her ED behaviors. A lesson I learned in the past year is that ED’s are not just about weight. They are about behaviors. There are many anorexics who are not underweight but struggle with behaviors. And why do most of them never seek treatment? Because they argue that they are a healthy weight and they can do it on their own. My friend from college dropped out of school last year, and her parents admitted her into an outpatient program. Unfortunately, she was not progressing enough and she felt invalid in her ED, so she sought out a residential program. Five to six months later, she’s never been so happy in her life. She is always full of energy and is always body positive. Of course, she still struggles, but she learned many healthy coping mechanisms and seeking help for her ED also battled her depressive thoughts. 

The point I am making is that you may not think you need residential because you appear healthy and think you will be able to handle it. And maybe you can. But in most cases, individuals fall in and out of their ED, and it gradually gets worse over time as the behaviors increase. I still highly recommend residential, or at least looking for one. I’m not looking at the short term of this, I’m looking at long term recovery."

But you also want to avoid eating less. Sometimes old habits arise as a response to stress. Have you been stressed out recently? Are you experiencing negative thoughts and feelings?"
EatingDisorders,f3xrau3,t3_dipcea,1571242679.0,"To be brutally honest, I don’t think you will be able to repair your relationship with exercising and food until you invest in real recovery. In other words, you might need to go into a residential facility. Trust me, I don’t like telling that to people with EDs, because it’s a stressful program and requires a lot of dedication to recovery. Unfortunately, your case sounds more serious than you think, especially since this has been a life long battle. It’s extremely difficult for someone with an ED to recover without seeking a treatment center first. I hope you understand that I don’t make this recommendation because I have no other advice. I have other tips for you, but based on how you described your situation, you need to seek treatment more than therapy from your school."

EatingDisorders,f3hqiq4,t3_dgx65r,1570927222.0,"It sounds like you are dealing with a range of complex issues that are all being triggered due to the vulnerability you are feeling right now. Losing someone you thought was the love of your life is heartbreaking and very difficult to deal with. Because the problems you are going through are intricate and require professional assistance, there’s not much advice people of Reddit can offer other than see a psychologist. If you know anybody you can trust and are close to, talk to them about your feelings and issues. I know heartbreak is really hard, and it might seem like your life is crumbling before you. Yet you still keep going. You muster up the strength to tell yourself that life moves forward, even when it seems impossible. You try to find meaning, something that you need in order to really live life. I really hope you reach out and find someone who can workout your problems with you. You are worth it"

It’s a tough journey with a lot of pain, but it’s for a better and happier future for yourself and those around you."
EatingDisorders,f355fri,t3_dfoh0w,1570668878.0,"I dated a girl who had an eating disorder. She was a purging anorexic. I had the same thoughts as your boyfriend. I would pay careful attention to her eating habits and stay up late at night with her because she would worry about purging. Eventually, it got to a point where I was not always going to be able to check up on her and see if she was eating properly. I had my life and I was in college. Moreover, it stressed me out having to check up on her all the time, and if she relapsed, she would fall deeper into her disorder, causing more stress in our relationship. I tried putting up with it and thought I could help her get through it. But it was just too much for me and I started feeling resentment for the position I was in. Over this last summer, she came forward to her parents about her ED, and she was able to see a therapist. Eventually, she ended up being sent off to a residential facility where she fully invested into recovery. She progressed a lot and has never been happier. Unfortunately for us, she had some other issues with her trauma and that destroyed our relationship along the way. Part of our relationship ending was because I invested so much energy and my life into her recovery, I became very unhappy and lashed out at her over the phone. She took it very personally and eventually broke up with me about a month later, despite the fact that I had invested into her recovery for over nine months of our relationship. 

The point? Your boyfriend needs to be supportive and patient to an extent that still allows him to focus on his life. And part of that is you taking action on your ED. In other words, you’re going to have to take some responsibility and get help for your ED, because relationships become extremely difficult when partners refuse to seek help for their personal problems. It can cause tension, depression, hurt, resentment, and a whole lot of other awful feelings. I know recovery sounds like a horrible pursuit, but you have to think really hard about your future. How do you think your ED will be in the next five years without professional assistance? How will this impact your life and your personality? How will it impact your family, friends, and your boyfriend? Although eating disorder recovery is a personal journey, it has a great impact on the relationships around you. Your boyfriend might think he can get you through it, but trust me, he can’t. Only you can completely bear the responsibility of recovery. Your boyfriend and family can be supportive though. I really hope you think about this"
EatingDisorders,f30jhl4,t1_f30e345,1570555745.0,"Yes. There are multiple reasons why an eating disorder can develop from trauma, but the essential and consistent reason why someone with PTSD, for example, would develop an eating disorder is because it is a coping mechanism. Trauma can cause immense psychological pain  and your brain will create a self-defense mechanism to combat the negative feelings and pain someone is experiencing. Some individuals can have anger problems due to trauma. Some individuals can suffer from depression and use self-harm methods to relieve the pain from trauma. Similarly, an eating disorder can develop as a coping mechanism to combat the psychological pain. An anorexic will refuse to eat because they feel better about themselves when they never eat (very simplified by the way). While growing up, they may have experienced trauma that negatively affected their self-image or destroyed their self-esteem. These can be potential reasons why they developed an eating disorder. Trauma is complex and requires a professional to help you piece your past together.

If you suffer from PTSD, then it is very likely your eating disorder is linked to your trauma. If you don’t know who to contact, reach out to the school counseling center and they may be able to help you out. Or you could try contacting The Emily Program, which is an eating disorder recovery program. But they’re based out of Seattle and I don’t know if you are close to that region. Going to a local hospital may help as they might help you contact a professional. I highly recommend you seek help with your trauma as well, since that is most likely the source of your eating disorder. But I also highly recommend you seek help for your ED since that is also urgent."
EatingDisorders,f3053xz,t3_dexqb4,1570546610.0,"Talk to a counselor. Eating disorders are not just about being thin or fat, it’s primarily about the behaviors. Therapists and doctors will help you cope with your behaviors and talk with others about your situation. There are various other things they will help you with (normally about trauma or your past since ED’s usually occur from trauma), but their main focus are your behaviors. You may think being fat invalidates you just like an anorexic person thinks they are healthy and thus attempts to invalidate themselves. But this way of thinking is among the behaviors of an eating disorder. And honestly it’s a way of thinking even trauma survivors can have. It’s necessary that you see a health professional immediately. Eating disorders are serious and progressively get worse without treatment very fast."

A person may be in love with someone, but if they are afraid of commitment, getting hurt, making mistakes, or do not fully trust the person they love, they may not feel ready to create a bridge. It’s difficult because we can try our utmost to prove why someone who is in love with us can trust us, why we won’t hold grudges against them, why you are both able to commit to one another.

This won’t sound realistic right now, but eventually, you will have to forgive yourself and let go. She have to do the same in order for her to move on with her life. For now, reflect on what happened. Take note of the mistakes you made or the choices you made that you think could have been better. Learn from them. Learn from this whole situation. Be patient with yourself. Give yourself time to think and communicate with others. Try to be self-compassionate. You have admitted your mistakes and feel sincerely sorry for them.

Listen man, you can talk with me if you would like. You are dealing with a fresh wound and it takes time to heal. I would try your best to talk with friends, spend time doing hobbies or activities you particularly enjoy, or maybe take time to reflect. Either way, you are dealing with a lot of emotion and you definitely do not want to internalize it. That will fuel resentment and could even make you depressed. Communicate your feelings with others. Maybe talk to a counselor. Write your thoughts down to organize your mind and take time to reflect. It will take time to heal, but you are still you in the end. Take care of yourself."
