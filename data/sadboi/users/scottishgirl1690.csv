Legal aid lawyers are sadly a dying breed these days as the work simply is not well remunerated enough and alot of firms are or one two man bands who cannot necessarily afford the time and cost of training new lawyers. Speaking from experience as someone who did their training in a legal aid practice.

Anti money laundering regulations are strict, and solicitors have a lot of obligations to comply with to ensure they comply. Equally you'd want the solicitor on the opposite side (selling the property to you) to do equal due diligence on their client -there have been some high profile and high value frauds in England from solicitors not obtaining this documentation, allowing fraudsters to 'sell' property that doesn't belong to them."
