That link has good recommendations about using separate media for Catalina, which is what I have been doing for every new macOS operating system release. I already have two Time Machines, one running presently, and one in archive containing the last backup of the previous macOS version before I upgraded my MacBook's operating system. I never had the need to use the previous OS, but I knew if I had to revert, I have a backup copy of my old operating system on my other external hard disk. 

You could follow the link's recommendation if you decide to go the route of adding a USB hub and purchasing a new external hard disk for Catalina. Like you said, it's not the end of the world, but can actually end up be the more convenient solution if you have to keep switching between Mojave and Catalina frequently for work in the foreseeable future."

Unless you've got one of those large external disks already with plenty of space available, maybe get another separate drive for Catalina. External hard drives are pretty cheap these days, even more so the portable 2.5"" ones."

Last year's model, known to have heat issues and throttling issues, still could not maintain their clock speeds even after Apple introduced software update to make their fans spin up earlier, more frequently and at higher rpms. 

Perhaps, the MacBook Pro Touch Bar generation, even with the improvements made to the 2019 model, still cannot dissipate heat as efficiently compared the pre-2016 models (like your 2013 model).
