Guess he regrets it since he knows Iâ€™m a Disney girl at heart too ðŸ˜‚"
depression,f8akdej,t1_f8acc7f,1574400007.0,"I hate when this happens. I give love and affection and want the same back but when I receive it, I also think I don't deserve it."
depression,f80xfpk,t1_f80e6z7,1574141385.0,"Same here and I have these thoughts on a daily basis. I only have one person who I love with every fiber of my body and he's honestly the only one pushing me to keep going through this shitty life but I do wish something would happen to me. I can't ever seem to go a day without thinking about how my life could suddenly end if I do something different from my normal routine. But I don't want to put him through any pain at all.

Keep pushing through."
love,f6hc5ah,t3_dr1kso,1572842668.0,"This was definitely something I needed to read. I overthink every single thing and I hate it with such intensity. I ask for reassurance every day even though I know I shouldn't. If my partner says something like he loves me, I should take his word. I know I'd be heartbroken if *he* were to tell me he thinks I don't love him when I really really do so I try to put myself in his position and that's when I don't overthink as much."
UnsentLetters,f5z477m,t3_dpss8b,1572566685.0,This hit hard. Iâ€™ve been there for the only guy Iâ€™ve ever loved for almost 5 years. I still love him with all of my heart but Iâ€™m just afraid he doesnâ€™t feel anything for me anymore since he was with that other girl over a year ago.
