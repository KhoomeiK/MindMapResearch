I snap at people more and I'm constantly apologizing. Its exhausting. But I do it, because i love the people in my life and i dont want to hurt someone because sometimes my brain is an asshole.

People with BPD tend to attract shitty people. I was married for 10 years. I never realized how bad it was because he never hit me. It wasn't obvious to me it was abusive.  My dad use to hit me, but as he hit me he reminded me how lucky I was, some kids have abusive parents that come home and beat them every day for no reason.  I was lucky, I only got beaten when i did something wrong. I 100% believed him. I was such a lucky kid. He left my mom eventually. About fours later, I'm 16 and talking to my friend in school. She had been removed from her moms custody because she had hit her with a belt. Do you know what I said to her? 

""Well did you deserve jt?"" I did in fact notice the alarmed look on her face so I continued with, ""my dad used to hit me with a belt all the time, but I had always deserved it.""

There was a brief moment where i just short circuited a bit as all the pieces clicked in my head. I laughed hysterically, until I was crying.  And then I went home and asked my mom to put me in therapy.

Yes, the majority getting it is great and will help tremendously,(assumingthe vaccine works, despite being rushed and doesn't cause an ""I am Legend"" scenario), however, the more people who can get it, and choose not to, increases the risk for others.

Now you're out and about in the world potentially spreading it to people who can't vaccinate, could have autoimmune disorders, and things like that.

My child had a bad reaction to her first set of vaccinations. It wasn't life threatening or anything but her doctor and I discussed how to proceed.  She's 8 now and healthy with all her vaccinations, but we did all of them one at a time (where possible) and much slower than other kids her age. I don't remember what her last vaccine was but let's pretend it was measles. She was unprotected from measles a lot longer than her peers.

That actually came about really badly with a kiddo that used a visual schedule.  His RBTs tended to forget to tell him to check his schedule for fun activities.  Scheduled breaks, playground time, even lunch.

ABA,fgk0w41,t3_eyvbzp,1580855217.0,"My first like 8-10 months I caught every single illness that came through the clinic. Since then it's been much better. Over the last month every single kiddo I worked with has been sick, but never ""sick enough"" to be sent home. One had some kind of chest thing, another had a sinus thing. A coworker took Hand foot and mouth home to her kiddo, and my boss and her son ended up with the flu. I have just now caught a minor case of sniffles. It gets better unfortunately a huge part of it is just time. I wash my hands like a crazy person, but there's only so much soap in the world when you have kids literally using you/your clothes as a tissue or coughing right into your face/mouth because ""cover your mouth"" is still a target. 

When my kiddos are sick I guard my sleep aggressively. I try to eat a little healthier and maybe take an extra vitamin/drink more orange juice. Any little thing I can do, but for me at least sleep is the killer. If the clinic has something and I have a night I lose sleep I always wake up sick. When I am successful in guarding my sleep, I usually fair okay."

I'm getting ready to head home for the day, and it's still not sitting well with me, so I tell my boss I'm going to stop by one more time on my way home. I stop knock on the door, still no answer. So I walk around the apartment and start peeking in the windows. The blinds are closed so I can barely see in but I finally make out what is clearly a human on the floor. I run around, check the front door, unlocked so open it and yell his name, but still just barge in hoping to be able to help him. The smell didn't hit me right away, I'd been sick with a cold, so I was at the door to his bedroom by the time I realized I could help him. He was decomposing, green and black and was become one with the carpet where his skin was touching it. They figure he'd been dead about 5 days, in the middle of summer, in Florida, with no AC running. Cause of death was not immediately obvious, and I had entered the apartment so I had to sit there outside his apartment for an hour waiting to talk to a detective."
depression,fe2yez7,t3_enehnl,1578844219.0,"I'm sorry you've had to deal with so much. You deserve love and happiness. Just because you've found yourself in another abusive relationship does not mean it's your fault.  Unfortunately people with mental health conditions are more likely to end up in abusive relationships.  Especially coming from a childhood of abuse and a seven year long abusive relationship it's not unlikely that your ""normal meter"" is a little broken. It's hard to see the signs of an abusive relationship when your in it. An abusive relationship doesn't have to ever have physical violence and even if it does it's unlikely to start that way. Abusers look for people that they can abuse, people that might be a little broken already.  It's not your fault, it's theirs. When you're ready to look for love again use your friends. If something seems off mention it to them. My normal meter does not work so great, I call my sister or my friend when I'm not sure about whether my feelings, reactions or others behavior is normal and okay. Sometimes I accept abnormal behavior as normal, and other times I think completely normal behavior is unacceptable.  So I have to check in from time to time to make sure I'm doing okay."

I kept stopping her and asking for clarification because everything she said sounded normal.  I ended up having essentially a mental breakdown where she's telling me about her abusive mother and I started laughing hysterically as the realization hit, until I was sobbing uncontrollably and had to be sent home where I had a long talk with my mom about my ex-stepfather and was promptly enrolled in therapy.

BehaviorAnalysis,fdes6ae,t3_ekj1zp,1578345490.0,"I related to your post so much. Not working in ABA though, I was working as a case manager for an ACT team. I loved my people, I loved helping people and I stuck it out for so long despite my mental and physical health deteriorating. (I legit almost had a stroke at 25) ABA is actually what saved me. I still got to do all things I was passionate about but in an environment and with people that supported me. I'm telling you this because just because ABA ended up not being the right fit you, or the lack of support you had doesn't mean you can't eventually find the right related field for you. I was so nervous coming to my current job from my old one. That job beat me down so much I was worried I wasn't cut out to be someone who helps people for a living.
