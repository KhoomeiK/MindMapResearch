dont be harsh on yourself. with depression just living life is enough of a feat.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Amidst the endless rubble

Of this land which never seems

To stop breaking

&#x200B;

I search for anyone

To end the static

Arid state, as the sun -

&#x200B;

A tiny dot in the pale

Sky beats down

On my tired eyes.

&#x200B;

Alone all time vanishes

Do i have my youthful glow,

Or will i drop dead at any moment?

&#x200B;

Uncaring, I call out for

Any soul, my ears

Tuned to the static

&#x200B;

Waiting desperately for a reply.

&#x200B;

Until i hear your call

And time comes into focus

And we're beautiful

&#x200B;

And suddenly you're

Drowning out this

Worn down life

&#x200B;

And i love you to bits.

&#x200B;

But who are ""you""

Of so many changing

Faces,

&#x200B;

Of so many goodbyes

And nervous introductions

And falls from grace

&#x200B;

We'll walk together

""Forever,"" I'll know you

While time is ticking down

&#x200B;

A stranger

As always, you're destined

To leave

&#x200B;

But for now,

Please hold

My hand."

i have tried some of these things, but they all offer temporary solutions, and the problem comes back as soon as i stop doing whatever im doing. i have already reached the point on fully giving up on that relationship. i even feel a hatred for my ex at times for doing what they did. but at the same time i recognize the time before the breakup as the only genuinely happy time i can recall. so with that combination its sort of just like ive given up on being happy, accepting this is how my life will be. i had my chance, and it left. the only serious problems in the relationship came right as it ended. about all the listing bad/good things, ive done that in the past and its sort of just like ""ok.. so what."" in the end all that matters to me is that its over, i dont care what went wrong or how i did good or bad, i just care that its gone."

it seems more like you're just hating on yourself telling yourself he deserves better. but if he loves you that much and refuses to leave then you probably think you're worse than you actually are. if you do love him back, and he loves you then your opinion of him ""deserving  better"" shouldn't be a reason to leave, since he is happy with you. but if you really don't love him back tell him. maybe say that you need to work on yourself and you can try the relationship again in the future. to me it sort of just sounds like you're putting yourself down due to self hatred saying he deserves better, when it doesn't matter to him. good luck"
