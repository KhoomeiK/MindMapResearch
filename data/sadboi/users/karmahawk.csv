Currently, I am in the process of transition from 10 years of web development into more of a systems type of role. What I've found is that a lot of companies start off with a monolithic application, but at a point as the business grows they need to switch over to service-oriented architecture to continue operating at scale. As it is difficult for 10 teams to work effectively on one or two monoliths. So I'm just looking for work with companies who're at that point in their development.

That being said, the salaries aren't too drastically different... maybe a 20% difference, but you also shouldn't expect to become an architect if you're working on a monolith.

We have an architect position but that's solutions architecture so it's more of a non-technical role. Which effectively makes being a senior a dead-end job within the organization. Because there is nobody you can go to for mentorship to become an effective team lead, tech lead, etc.

You don't have to quit your job outright to take care of yourself.

But having said this, companies sometimes will give you the time off because they must, but when you get back trump up charges like performance to force a resignation. Essentially, the trick is to get them to agree to PIP and if they don't plan on keeping your midway through or thereabouts offer up a resignation in exchange for a positive review. Firing is expensive and this offers them an incentive not to do it. Since you have a decent amount of savings I think this strategy would be wise.  


You can take like 3 months off with FMLA and are entitled to partial salary continuation.

cscareerquestions,f75hoiq,t3_dud0gw,1573415236.0,"When I was doing it I operated a myriad of [keyword.com](https://keyword.com) websites. Which used to be a big SEO trick to quickly rank for non-competitive terms. I locked content behind what think of as *interaction walls*. This could be a tool, a calculator, whatever so the user would have to interact most closely with advertisements to view content they came for.

Another blueprint or so to speak I'd follow was exploiting referral programs for companies like Gilt that were invite-only.  Basically I would register URLs like [giltinvites.com](https://giltinvites.com) or [guiltinvites.com](https://guiltinvites.com) and rank for misspellings on the company's brand name. Then I would take the accruing store credit and purchase flipable items.

Finally, I would also run those spammy, scammy fake review websites for diet and health products. Most of the traffic would come from backlinks on the content I would put on to various platforms e.g. youtube, pre-youtube equivalents, social-bookmarking websites, etc.

All in all, I was earning about $24,000/year. This was also at a time in my life when I was not paying rent, had no debt, etc. so the annual income per year was actually quite good. But having said this, doing all of this sucked up a ton of my time. I had basically no life outside of operating my business."

Yeah, that's got nothing to do with translating code from one language to another, and everything to do with the concept of programming into a language, not in it. Which is something heavily promoted in the book Code Complete. Doing that allows you to fly between programming languages while avoiding the pitfalls of the languages. Like for example in PHP by default, the array is the primary data structure for everything, but if you use standard libraries you can get access to most data structures."
