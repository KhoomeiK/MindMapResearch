It's my second semester here (transfer) and I made the mistake of taking 18 credit hours (BioE 240, cs141, cs151, Phys 141, and Calc III, honors seminar, and additional TA training course) on top of TAing two CS labs a week.

Ended up having to drop a class, and elected for all cr/NC. Which also meant I calculated how much I needed to earn on my finals to pass everything and basically realized that I didn't even need to write my name on most of them, and I was so demoralized from the overwhelming nature of my semester before coronavirus even happened, and really just wanted the semester to be over. Tbh, I got 2 Bs and 2 Cs üò£ but I think I finally learned my lesson.

I'm hoping I can bring my GPA up enough to at least stay in honors college. Only taking 13 hours next semester, I don't care how long I takes me to graduate, I don't want to do it without learning the shit out of things (which makes getting a 4.0 much easier, from past experience).

That being said, my trans binary brother doesn't find my stance invalidating, and has done a lot to help me feel valid.

The only person who said I was invalidating, or made any sort of arguments like that were my cis hetero partner while he was struggling with me coming out."

 My brother also, totally not on purpose but because he couldn't hide his beard and what not, came out during the week my grandmother spent dieing in my mom's living room.

The whole, me being an apostate and it becoming official when my brother and I arrived thing sort of laid down some cover fire for my brother, and like I said my mom was surprisingly cool (for someone who was disowning their youngest over the literal last breaths of their non JW mom)."

math,foee0i2,t3_g7165h,1587701507.0,"I TA for a Matlab class for engineering students (college level) and am currently taking a program design course taught in c++.

While they are fairly similar, Matlab is FAR easier to work with for someone with no programming experience, but it costs money to get a license and the citrix (free) version sucks. I think the cheapest one was $69 for students through my university.

You can use an online IDE like repil.it or something similar with c++, but that doesn't come with a debugger, and if you get into much with c++ you need one.

I think also, from what I understand, that Matlab does a much better job of memory allocation and what not without much effort on your part. c++ can get gross, again depending on how much you want to do with it.

GL! Hope this helps."

exjw,foat2we,t1_foangdh,1587652039.0,"Physics doesn't say everything came from nothing. It says we're still expanding, and probably used to be super compressed.

I can imagine the mostly negative space of every atom being super compressed and lining up like a lattice, allowing all the mass of the universe to be contained in an incredibly small area, just before it exploded into the universe that became our home a few billion years later after it had a bit of a chance to cool.

But the idea of an all knowing god making this shit up? Why? Where did that idea even come from, and why bother with things that you cannot prove at all? Why would this god wait through the billions of years of evolution (something we do have evidence of, and may yet be proven as a law and not just be heald as a theory--and I mean it ha word the way it is used in the scientific community, not the colloquial meaning of a good guess) and then not bother with any other creatures aside from the ones at the top of the food chain?"

exjw,fo98foo,t3_g6ccw0,1587612972.0,"No, I don't believe in a god. I'm sure we are not the most advanced beings in the universe, but the idea of a big plan and omnipotence is a bit far fetched.

I also have learned enough about the history of religion to fully realize it is a man made invention to control population, and something that evolved with societies.

Going to college has been helpful in dispelling mythology from my childhood as well. I understand the psychology of convincing children to believe in preposterous things, and how hard it becomes to challenge those ideas as we age and they solidify around parts of our personalities.

When most people leave the bOrg, at first they are religious or have 'faith', but I think those who learn critical thinking skills and how to apply them eventually move on.

Of course I'm open to being wrong about god or creation, but so far so there has been zero actual evidence of anything other than the fact that some books are mad old.

Don't get me started on how shit of a university I would be attending if they only used one small collection of books to teach every subject that was over a thousand years old. Those books are trash if you actually read them (it's ok to own slaves, rape women, etc)."

Young women are powerful only in that they are desired--which isn't power, it's being a rabbit in a tiger cage and being told to be grateful for the attention. Old women are deemed nasty, the thing that young women and mid aged women fight so hard against, and eventually become invisible at best or detestable at worst.

Meanwhile old men become silver foxes and gain clout for their xp and wisdom.

Maybe words like ""crazy"" only help to stigmatize the recently escaped who should be seeking mental health care, but have been made intentionally weary of the very people who could help them escape delusional and extremist thinking.

I'm not saying we shouldn't exorcize caution, and a healthy dose of scepticism, but what did you expect to come out of a cult? A bunch of healthy model citizens with good education and critical thinking skills?"
