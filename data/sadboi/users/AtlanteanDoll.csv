Does he play solo at all?  What helped me a lot was doing offline raid, like scav at impossible + horde + tagged N cursed.

I had no choice to get used to movements in map and silhouettes, maybe you guys can hop on discord and try that and compete to who kills the more scavs.

You should try to read some of the answers of a bunch of posts here and on r/bpd with an emotional distance. My personal experience with mental illness makes it really hard to think otherwise.

i think some people tend to forget that we(not all) have some cognitive distortions and we often don't see the reality as it is. as a teenager i used to be straight up delusional and i'd also be mad when someone used depressive when they apparently weren't cause I really wanted to kms and would think no one understood me and they clearly didn't really know how it feels like.

Personnally I would get angry because it wasn't about me or I didn't share the same interest and I was like wtf why is he interested in something I am not as if he wasn't authorized or something lol. Also, tend to be jealous of what brings happiness in people and I can't feel the same. I used to think ""what I like is what people should like and what I dont like my S/O should dislike it aswell"". Tbh that isn't how things work and it would only bring negativity in my relationships. It requires a lot of time and patience, but in the end I'm the only one who's capable of controling it.

My actual S/O is fantastic but I'm also working on myself, trying to get my life together and I've found that I really enjoy painting and learning guitar, so it's easier when he is talking about thinks he likes to do cause I've found some myself.

I'm sorry I'm not a native speaker so I hope you can understand what I mean, but basically, it might be because you /we/ I personally don't have interests and you get frustrated because of ""jealousy"". And I'll talk about myself, but I lack an identity and I try to be a chameleon for the most part, and I'm frustrated when I discover about a new interest I didn't know about cause I can't be the ""cool girl"" about it since I didn't know.
