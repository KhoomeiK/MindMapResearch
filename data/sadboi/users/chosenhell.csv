I told her through my tears I've been seeing a therapist and that I was diagnosed with BPD.

She said ""oh sweetheart, you're fine. You don't have *that* and that therapist is just looking for your money... besides, why haven't you ever talked to me about how bad you feel? What did I do? Don't you trust your mother anymore? Am I the problem? That therapist will turn you against me I forbid you to see him ever again!""

•I'm usually super excited and way too happy about anything! Like I once ordered a beer and as soon the waiter brought drinks to me and my friends I've literally shouted so loud that everyone looked at me at bit concerned...

•I spend hours taking hundreds of selfies (and I always look good in them when I'm hypomanic).

•I can become very talkactive! I have so many things I need to say that I forget to listen to what others are saying. I even interrupt them midsentence just to get out some of the things my mind is telling me.

•Food becomes awesome, looks awesome and everything tastes ten times better. Also alcohol looks even better.

•I can't stand doing just *one* thing, I need to keep my mind busy with new and exciting things (funny thing is that everything can be exciting while I'm hypomanic).

•I could sing and dance forever.

•I feel very social and I make myself available on every known socialmedia so that people start texting me (This is something I hate very much when I become depressed again because I can never keep up with it).

•I feel like I need to do something, but I usually never know what to do and this drives me crazy.

•I make plans, tons of awesome plans! I just wish I was able to stick to them, but I usually fall back pretty soon...

Dissociation,fi38ppm,t1_fi1vpm4,1582106502.0,"Thank you for your response.

I've actually never looked into CBT, but I'm doing some sort of individual DBT with my therapist.

Dissociation is actually a defense mechanism we develop to protect ourselves when we feel we're in ""extreme danger"". Every living being can dissociate (animals do so when they know about to die), so yes, even panic attacks can trigger dissociation since most of the times you think you're about to die.

Dissociation can also be a symptom of BPD. My dissociation is triggered by past trauma, so I don't think I can simply just *stop* doing it. Sometimes I'm not even anxious... Anyway trying to get back to our senses is a good grounding technique! And you're right, practicing does really work wonders!

To be honest I don't ""hate"" dissociation, my therapist said that this is a defense mechanism that I (as many others) developed to survive... and it worked! That's why I struggle to live without dissociation. I'm also pretty used to it by now. 

I'm more concerned about the paranoia that started coming after, that's something I'm not used to and I still didn't have the chance to bring this up to my therapist."

BPD,fg0n086,t3_ew8k9g,1580411061.0,"Not sure about the DAE... I probably had a similar experience so I'll share it. 

When I was a child I was damn sure people were watching me through holes in my house, I clearly remember how I pictured them spying on me. I was so paranoid whenever I went outside cause I kept thinking that anyone could've been one of the people who watched me through the holes. 

I eventually stopped playing with toys and doing barely anything cause I was always too busy checking my back to see if I managed to catch someone.

This is pretty much my only childhood memory btw

Now I still get paranoid about stuff sometimes, but I'm constantly dissociating so it's probably just that.

I'm not sure if this is similar to what you experienced, but I'd talk about it to a therapist/psychiatrist, take care!"

My therapist (who I've been seeing for a year now because of my BPD, so he kinda knows me) diagnosed me with bipolar type 2 just recently and I'm like ""nah I'm good dude I'm not taking them meds!"""
