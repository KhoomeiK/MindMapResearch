They fixed that in USUM, but those games added so little that they should've just been post game DLC for SM."
pokemon,fkj5pdy,t1_fkj3nf8,1584236883.0,"When it comes to characters, none of them have growth, or development, or shown to have any emotion other than what they have when they start. Lillie is a child who stresses over Cosmog, Cosmoem, then eventually Solgaleo or Lunala. Her only growth comes with her deciding it's ok for the player to battle and capture it, and even then she's reluctant. Hau is the worst of them all, always being happy to lose no matter what. ""Aw darn I lost for the 437th time but I'll get you next time for sure!"" At least Hop changes in that way. For the first few battles he does the same thing Hau did, not minding a loss, but then after a while he realizes he's not going to win easily, you can tell when he starts to doubt himself by his dialogue. He starts saying, ""Well crap I need to train harder if I'm gonna beat you."" ""Huh, maybe I need to train my strategy against you."" ""Well, I've lost again. Maybe I'll never find the right way to win."" Until he comes to the revelation that battling isn't always about winning and losing, it's about the fun of it. Hau ONLY has that mindset, and it doesn't change at all whatsoever through the course of the game. And you're straight up wrong if you think there's any character to Guzma or Kukui. Once again, they don't change. Guzma is just an annoying prick who wants to get in the way and he's a mindless grunt to Lusamine and doesn't question her, even when she abandons him. Kukui is just annoying. He gives useless tips that never help, and he's probably one of the worst professors/champions ever. Gladion seemed to be the only one with any true personality, and was severely underused. He actually realized he was being a dick and decided to train with Type:Null/Silvally to be a better person and trainer. Plumeria I barely even remember, I actually completely forgot she existed, but she was just edgy and emo, had no growth or change. Basic. You can tell they tried to have a do over of these characters in SwSh. Hop is the new Hau, actually having growth and development, Marnie is Plumeria, again actually having growth, the strength to rebel against her brother and the cheerleaders that stand behind her because she's annoyed by them. Bede to me seems to be Gladion, and again having true change and going from being an absolutely snooty stuck up dbag to taking up responsibility as a gym leader, though unwilling at first. And Leon was charismatic and a passionate champion. He helped everyone he could, defeated Dynamax Pokemon left and right, and held so much power that people would rather look up to him than any authoritative figure. He was the best, and the people knew it. They loved him because he was strong, but he was kind as well. If any of the characters in SM/USUM had any of the development of one single character in SwSh, it would've made the gameplay maybe a little more bearable, but not by much. The games in of themselves were just boring and way too easy. Granted SwSh did have its own easy moments, such as rewarding maybe a little too much XP candy from early dens, but at least the gameplay was fun, the gyms took place of the island challenges and were actually entertaining rather than ""Watch my dancing Marowak and watch out for the random dude that's gonna join the performance and make this challenge super easy for you."" SM/USUM were just such forgettable, tearable games that I can't be bothered to even look at my copies anymore. I played basically the same game 3 times (Sun, Moon, and Ultra Sun) and the only things that stick out in my mind are the Alolan versions of Kantonian Pokemon, shiny farming wormholes (not to mention the disgusting controls and depth perception problems with them), and Ultra Necrozma. From Sword I think of epic legendary battles, Dynamaxed Pokemon taking over stadium after stadium, the incredible Eternamax fight where Zacian and Zamazenta come to your aid, the friend you make in Hop, after he sticks by you until the end, Bede coming to battle you one final time at the league, and the long awaited battle with Leon."
pokemon,fkihsd0,t1_fkic52b,1584220320.0,Literally USUM could've been DLC. I remember Ultra Necrozma and the Wormholes cuz of shiny farming. And how annoying the characters were. They should've just released a third game.
pokemon,fki3d86,t1_fki0sb7,1584211158.0,"Because for what you get to experience, you actually get to see the story unfold whereas the characters are all so bland and boring in SM that it makes it seem like nothing. And I hope you're joking about the ""emotion and strong theming of SM"" because there really isn't any. The only real emotion is between Lily and her mother but even then it's so predictable it's lame. Bad guy sees what they're doing wrong when faced by the harsh words of their child. At least in SwSh you can see the characters grow and develop, and Leon realizes there can and are better trainers out there than himself. Bede finds himself at fault and attempts to correct his ways. Even Hop won't give up until he's a better trainer."
pokemon,fkhpmj4,t1_fkho1i8,1584203607.0,"And while you are given items from time to time, it's not like you're given everything you need all the time. SwSh were still kinda easy, but at least they told a decent story with interesting characters instead of everyone being a carbon copy of Hau."

pokemon,fkhd0v9,t3_figkpz,1584195752.0,"I personally would put SM/USUM at the very bottom of my list of Pokemon Games I've played. It felt too hand holding and straight forward. The game just seemed too easy to play. That being said, I totally would've bought Eclipse based on your ideas. But sadly Game Freak just went, ""You know what a good idea is? Take the EXACT SAME GAME we already released, tweak a total of 3 things that could easily just be made DLC, and RERELEASE THE GAME. Bam, easy profit!"" Sun and Moon especially were just so disappointing because there just was no endgame, and catching Necrozma wasn't any sort of big event. At least they changed that in USUM but it was still just very meh imo."

pokemon,fjpelyx,t3_fejef6,1583548798.0,"I still have my Pippy. He's sitting in Pokemon Home as we speak. I even cloned him a few times back in the old days so I could keep him in various games, but I stopped doing that because it was cruel, not just to him but to myself. I've questioned sometimes whether i have the original but I trust my past self enough to have kept the right one. I never took him out of my party in Diamond, ever, because I didn't want him to think I didn't love him. I once lent him to a friend that was having trouble with the elite four and freaked out daily thinking I wouldn't get him back. I finally did and I vowed never to lose sight of him again. So I keep him and the rest of my original party I grew up with updated with every new game. I just hope Sword and Shield eventually allow me to play with my children again."
Supernatural,fia1akb,t3_f6utk4,1582290200.0,"I can definitely see where you're coming from. To me, in the later seasons, they all just become so... emo. Every episode it's ""I'm in a dark place right now"" or ""I understand you're in a dark place right now"" dark place this dark place that and it kinda gets annoying. Like, your LIVES are a dark place. You used to make the best of it and destroy anyone who got in your way. Now every time you make any sort of mistake, your hair falls down in front of your face. I do still enjoy the series, don't get me wrong, but there are times when I'm quite irritated. I feel like they injected a bit too much of the fanbase into the show (which isn't a bad thing, if done on a minor scale) which kinda just made it a cash grab."
