AskReddit,fo2ahy5,t3_g53q03,1587455126.0,"Sorry this is gonna be all over the place as it's 2am and I'm not good ar stories. Me, 16 at the time (almost 18 now), him 18 at the time. I came to the realisation that our friendship was basically alcoholism with extra steps. I considered him my best friend but all we did together was drink or something related to alcohol. The thing that set me onto realising this was as follows. I bought us a bottle of vodka and as we were driving around, I paid for some McDonald's and we went to the river to sit down and eat. He had already opened the bottle and started drinking and he made some friends and shared with people at the river. When we got to his house he was already tipsy and then a friend invited herself over because she was in town. The night ensued with them drinking mostly. Me sort of being there. I only had maybe 2 shots the whole night. We somehow end up playing truth or dare and shit gets sexual making me Extremely. Uncomfortable. They're completely fine touching eachother and tonguing eachother. Night sorta slows down and the game basically comes to an end when I don't feel comfortable kissing her (I'd never kissed anyone at that time). We end up going to bed with me on a couch about 10 feet from them and them sleeping in his bed. After probably 40 minutes they start kissing and eventually having sex thinking I'm sound asleep. Whereas I'm thinking about how fucking gross and awful it is because they're literally 10 feet away from me. Well after that night was over I was thoroughly annoyed and was content with leaving as soon as I woke up, but I ended up getting stuck driving her home. I was thinking, ""fine. Alright I guess. I'll be a nice guy"" so I drive her home. We talk about life after freshman year as that was the last I'd seen her and she veers the conversation towards my friend and claims that he basically talks down on me and talks shit about me behind my back. Which I whole heartedly agree with. He did do shit like that. After that fucking barnfire of an experience I was content with never talking to either again but a few weeks later he calls me at about a quarter to midnight because she's accusing him of rape. I text her and she tells me to stay out of it or else I'll get involved. He's crying about shit and I end up going to his house to sort out the entire experience again while he wrote down the play by play. After that I stopped talking to him. I couldn't deal with court. I couldn't deal with the alcoholism. I couldn't deal with him. After a few days though she tried to apologize and said she was dropping the accusations and tried to make amends with me to which I said, ""fuck off. I'm done with both of you."" 

I probably left out a bunch of details and this is a severely one sided story as I'm very uncomfortable about the whole thing. There was other things that he did that also sort of tore the friendship but this was the last sort of encounter. After this I thought about our friendship and realised he only messaged me when he wanted someone to get drunk with. And I gave him that."
