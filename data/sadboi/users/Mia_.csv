moving,fqspz0v,t3_gkmn0a,1589614792.0,"I grew up 45 mins from Sacramento, CA, and I love the area! It’s a city so a lot of things are walkable, theres public transportation and the area is beautiful. My sister used to live in midtown Sacramento and we would walk to get breakfast in the mornings, it’s a pretty safe area. The weather is great in my opinion, I live in New York currently and I definitely prefer California weather. It’s never freezing cold (I had to buy a proper coat to come to NY because I never needed one), and the summers get really hot but it’s a dry heat rather than humid. It’s definitely a more liberal area if that matters to you, it’s extremely diverse too. Its not super congested like NYC, although it does get busy. It’s the state capitol of California so there’s a lot of historical buildings/activities too such as Old Sacramento. The Mexican food is amazing, definitely another thing I miss since leaving California. It’s also about an hour and a half from San Francisco. Overall I love the area that I grew up in, it’s very welcoming. An issue that you might not be familiar with is that California in general has a huge issue with homeless people. In the town I am from (stockton), theres homeless people everywhere, it’s pretty normal. In Sacramento, I’ve seen a handful but not nearly as much as stockton. Still, it’s something to consider as I’m sure there are large homeless camps/areas in some parts of Sacramento. I hope my write up was helpful, good luck!"

She never replied to me but since I was getting email confirmations about remaining as a resident I figured everything was fine.

I know that I can’t be the only one who slipped through the cracks, no way that 160 other students got an email about moving out and just decided to leave everything in their rooms.

relationships,fo99quw,t3_g6ar4f,1587613879.0,"When I first saw my boyfriend spend his entire day on his Xbox it upset me because I felt completely ignored, and hearing him be loud just made me even more annoyed. I didn’t live with him at the time, but I’ve been living with him for the past month. Now I don’t mind that he plays his games, and I realize that I overreacted before. My anger came from a place of resentment that he was having so much fun all day with his friends — I thought why couldn’t he spend that time with me and have that many laughs? Now I realize it’s different, I think of when I used to play games online with my friends and how it’s just a fun experience, you’re focused on the game, everything else is just noise. It’s not personal. But if your partner is feeling unloved or neglected outside of you playing games, then you playing all day might’ve just been the last straw for her. Ask her if she’s upset because your relationship needs to be improved - have an honest conversation. My bf and I’s relationship is the best it’s ever been in 3.5 years, and that definitely contributes to me not causing an argument if he’s playing games for hours at a time.

I got multiple emails from the dorm about the being able to stay, one of them confirming that I am still a resident and when I visited the dorm I got the new IDs from the director.

sex,flhf0wr,t3_foq53k,1585161422.0,"yeah, intimacy is really important to me. but it also depends on why we’re not having sex. if we’re not having sex because we’re arguing, I feel distant, but if it’s because one of us is sick, we aren’t able to visit each other etc then although it feels less romantic it doesn’t really effect me that much. usually stuff like that doesn’t last long, either."
