moving,fqspz0v,t3_gkmn0a,1589614792.0,"I grew up 45 mins from Sacramento, CA, and I love the area! It‚Äôs a city so a lot of things are walkable, theres public transportation and the area is beautiful. My sister used to live in midtown Sacramento and we would walk to get breakfast in the mornings, it‚Äôs a pretty safe area. The weather is great in my opinion, I live in New York currently and I definitely prefer California weather. It‚Äôs never freezing cold (I had to buy a proper coat to come to NY because I never needed one), and the summers get really hot but it‚Äôs a dry heat rather than humid. It‚Äôs definitely a more liberal area if that matters to you, it‚Äôs extremely diverse too. Its not super congested like NYC, although it does get busy. It‚Äôs the state capitol of California so there‚Äôs a lot of historical buildings/activities too such as Old Sacramento. The Mexican food is amazing, definitely another thing I miss since leaving California. It‚Äôs also about an hour and a half from San Francisco. Overall I love the area that I grew up in, it‚Äôs very welcoming. An issue that you might not be familiar with is that California in general has a huge issue with homeless people. In the town I am from (stockton), theres homeless people everywhere, it‚Äôs pretty normal. In Sacramento, I‚Äôve seen a handful but not nearly as much as stockton. Still, it‚Äôs something to consider as I‚Äôm sure there are large homeless camps/areas in some parts of Sacramento. I hope my write up was helpful, good luck!"

Now I realize it‚Äôs different, I think of when I used to play games online with my friends and how it‚Äôs just a fun experience, you‚Äôre focused on the game, everything else is just noise. It‚Äôs not personal. But if your partner is feeling unloved or neglected outside of you playing games, then you playing all day might‚Äôve just been the last straw for her. Ask her if she‚Äôs upset because your relationship needs to be improved - have an honest conversation. My bf and I‚Äôs relationship is the best it‚Äôs ever been in 3.5 years, and that definitely contributes to me not causing an argument if he‚Äôs playing games for hours at a time.

vegancirclejerk,fmase42,t3_ftz77f,1585905941.0,the support these kinds of posts get have me speechless....suddenly meat eaters don‚Äôt eat fruits? veggies? grains?? üôÑüôÑ and I guess factory farm workers are treated fairly huh?
VeganForCircleJerkers,fmar5nf,t1_fmaquam,1585904528.0,"i see what you mean, especially with the hunting part. it seems like he doesn‚Äôt care enough to stop, idk how I‚Äôd even react if my boyfriend told me he wanted to go hunting. it‚Äôs so off putting. i would be honest with him about how eating meat in front of you grosses you out, maybe take him to a vegan spot & see how he likes it? it sucks that it‚Äôs always the hardest to talk about veganism to those closest to us!! hope things get better for you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
VeganForCircleJerkers,fmaqmax,t3_ftjapn,1585903923.0,"My boyfriend of 3 years isn‚Äôt vegan, but he often chooses vegan options when we go out to eat & is open to the idea of veganism. We even talked about our future kids being vegan and he was open to that as well. We talked about hunting and puppy mills, he was super understanding and agreed they were wrong. Definitely try to have a serious talk with him about your values and say that they are non negotiable. If he doesn‚Äôt take your values seriously, or immediately writes them off, then there‚Äôs not much left to the relationship. I‚Äôve argued with my boyfriend about veganism before but overall we always were able to come to an understanding."

sex,flhf0wr,t3_foq53k,1585161422.0,"yeah, intimacy is really important to me. but it also depends on why we‚Äôre not having sex. if we‚Äôre not having sex because we‚Äôre arguing, I feel distant, but if it‚Äôs because one of us is sick, we aren‚Äôt able to visit each other etc then although it feels less romantic it doesn‚Äôt really effect me that much. usually stuff like that doesn‚Äôt last long, either."
WorkOnline,flg6ewy,t3_fonwxo,1585132549.0,"UserTesting pays $10 per 10-15 minute review of a website (only audio is recorded, no video). It takes roughly a week to get started. Prolific is one of the best survey sites. Look up lionbridge (I recommend rater) and appen, they are part time jobs which will take a couple of weeks to get set up."

birthcontrol,flfsbnj,t3_fo95xn,1585116003.0,"If you‚Äôre not able to use insurance, it‚Äôs $15 a pack plus a $15 first time consultation. Nurx sends out 3 packs at a time, so the packs plus my consultation cost me $60. After that, it‚Äôs $15 a pack (price may vary depending on you bc). I get levora, a combo pill."
