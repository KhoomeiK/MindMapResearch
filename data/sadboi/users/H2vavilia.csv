I hope it continues to get better for you dude/gal. Anxiety doesn't just disappear, but it can be managed."
Anxiety,fl8hl0c,t3_fn4jvt,1584923855.0,"Smoke weed. haha. But to be real though anxiety is usually chronic, but no one has the same level of anxiety or triggers. I tried meds for a few years, but they didn't do shit and the withdraws are rough.

You gotta find out what triggers your anxiety. If you can know exactly what makes you anxious you can better combat it. One of my major anxiety triggers is social interactions especially over the phone for whatever reason. But if I look deeper, all of my anxiety runs back to running thoughts.

There are plenty of things you can do to help combat anxiety though. Limiting caffeine, getting stable and adequate sleep, and make sure to have a moment by yourself with no one around and just relax. 

Plus coping measures. I can usually stop a panic attack in it's tracks by using a method of realizing my senses. It goes like:
Observe the following:
5 things you can see with your eyes.
4 things that you can touch. 
3 things you can hear 
2 things you can smell 
1 thing you can taste.

You do that and your mind will be focused on that and not what was making you anxious.

Also another thing you can do. Simply toss and catch something. Doesn't matter what it is. But that will cool you down pretty quick.

People be people and people judge. Good thing people's opinions are their own. In the end be you. You are yourself and that's all that matters."
