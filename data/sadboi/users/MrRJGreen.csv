(Also at 23 seconds if you pause it right you cab see it's shadow)


But also as others said, it could be drones, just looks more like a mounted camera to me"

From the tip of the point to the top is ~185mm 
The ""arm span"" is ~75mm
And the main body width is 20~30mm"

depression,fdnw2mm,t3_ecb4lx,1578594017.0,"This is something I feel a lot, but what I generally feel more, is wishing that I never existed in the first place, I wouldn't really just want to die so young, not because it isn't something I feel would end my mental suffering, but because I wouldn't want to cause any hurt or suffering to any friends or family that I'd be leaving behind. 
I'd rather just essentially be erased so that nobody knew I existed, that way nobody would be hurt because I'm gone. 


I'm sorry I can't say anything that may help in any way, but I truly hope you find some peace and happiness in your life."
