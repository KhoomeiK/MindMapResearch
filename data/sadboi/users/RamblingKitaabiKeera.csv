Thank God I'm not the only one."

Makeup,fq5ki86,t3_ggu5fb,1589108866.0,"After. Always after. Even if it's light eyeliner because I'm an idiot who messes up her eyeliner a million times and each time I have to remove it, I have to redo my concealer as well. 

I always finish my eyeshadow and eyeliner first, do the rest of my face, and at the end, add eyeshadow to my lower lashline."

French,fq5dz0s,t1_fq57ax0,1589101727.0,Same! I kept mixing up what language I was speaking and my autocorrect was going nuts.
PCOS,fq5d7ot,t3_ggwbnw,1589100912.0,"I've never shaved my entire body, so yikes. Generally, I get my arms, half legs (more like half shin because I'm lazy), part of my upper back and a bit of my chest waxed, basically any areas that I don't cover with clothes, which is few. 

I once had to get my stomach waxed because I had to have surgery and since I'm a big girl, that really took a while. I don't think I would do that again. 

I'm wary of shaving the rest of my body because of how it itches like hell when it grows back, though I do shave my arms and chest when I need to. Although, I'm tempted to shave my entire legs now just to see what it would feel like. I don't think I've ever had them completely waxed (even I can't handle that much pain). 

My private bits, I always shave. Nair doesn't get rid of everything for me so shaving is the only option. 

I actually use the epilator on my face. But I used to get my face waxed between 14 and roughly 19. When I went to college, I started using the epilator because I could do it on my own then, plus it reduced the acne and dark spots that I had on my face.

Edit: I also get my pits waxed, but lately I've just been shaving them.

Edit 2: I am like 36 on the Ferriman-Gallwey scale, so go figure üòÇ and this is after getting laser on my face and regularly waxing my arms."
