Each have their own process. A lot of mine did talk therapy. I started seeing a psychiatrist due to in patient care earlier in the year after a suicide attempt. She started giving me tasks and what they call homework.  It was helping but then I lost my youngest brother to suicide 5 months ago from a .22 to his forehead. I saw him...

Some sessions she let's me talk and work out how I'm feeling and other days she takes over. Every session is different but helpful and she always helps in some way. It's never generic questions. Sometimes they are quite difficult and she helps me find the answers to what I'm searching for. 

Idk if this helps but if you arent getting anything from your sessions you might want to look into someone who specializes with grief and PTSD. Mine is also trained in EMDR therapy which is said to help we just haven't reached that point yet with everything being so fresh for me.

Everyone here has solid advice. And you can always talk about what you went through here it has helped me.
