depression,fnifaqk,t3_g1jxci,1586979013.0,I feel this. I often feel like I have to 'pretend' to be happy. It was my graduation in Jan (an event I should've felt elated about) and honestly all I felt was vague annoyance.

There are cameras everywhere and nurses monitoring you constantly. When you get there they search your belongings and take away anything 'dangerous': razors, belts, shoelaces, even mouthwash because it has alcohol in it. The nurses lock those items up and you have to ask for permission to use them. No cellphones allowed. They even took my books away because they said it'd make me 'isolate myself'.
They also do a quick physical and check your body for signs of self-harm. 

It's very structured. You wake up at the same time every day, get meds, breakfast, a couple of therapy sessions (both group and individual), lunch, more therapy, supper, time to chill and do whatever (e.g. shower, chat to other patients, call someone on the landline or watch TV), get meds again, be in bed with the lights off by 10pm. 

Weird shit happens sometimes. Some guys got kicked out for smoking hair gel (because that's a thing you can do apparently?). Another guy fainted during a session and claimed he was possessed by demons. A patient said she was a witch doctor and performed a ritual at night where she snorted herbs, did a handstand, grabbed other patients' faces and relayed 'messages from their ancestors'. I have so many stories lol.

Overall I found it a helpful experience. It was tough, but I bottle my emotions up so it was useful to have a safe space where I could let everything out. It didn't 'fix' my issues, but it was a good starting point for my recovery."
