MadeMeSmile,fpjq2xa,t1_fpikquo,1588677563.0,"Idk how big your press is but I would do about 25-30g of medium coarse ground coffee per 350g of water. 

1. Preheat your press with hot water 
2. Dump out water and add your coffee grounds and give it a shake to level the grounds
3. Pour water (195-205°F) about halfway, making sure there are no dry spots and wait 1 minute. 
4. Give it a stir with a spoon and fill the press up the rest of the way 
5. Place the plunger and press down just enough to create a seal and wait the additional 3 minutes
6. Press the plunger down firmly. 

Step 3 and 4 are really important. This is called a bloom, which is when CO2 is released and creates a more balanced cup. 

Tip: Be sure to remove all coffee from the carafe immediately because it will turn bitter from over extracting while sitting on the coffee grounds."

unpopularopinion,fn51ztu,t1_fn4zqc2,1586654032.0,"Okay but don’t you think that the way we think and value our current lives in modern society are derived from those older/extinct cultures/societies? Democracy, religion, art, etc are all derived from older cultures, which furthers to support my argument. It’s also not MY definition but one that is widely accepted and used in the field of anthropology. I don’t think I was trying to disagree with you, just enlighten you because you asked who would care if cultures disappeared and it’s very clear that things wouldn’t be the way that they are without them so yes they very much do matter. 

People still mine for gold recreationally. There is actually backpack-sized equipment you can use to find gold. My sister and I used to pan for gold all the time with our parents and the hobby is still really popular in El Dorado County, CA today. They have whole ass parades and celebrations in Placerville, CA that celebrate the gold rush and 49er culture. I only know this because I grew up in that town and we would literally visit Sutter’s Mill every year to mine for gold with all of our friends and family. There is overwhelming support of the gold rush era that remains in placerville because they don’t want it to be erased, which is why people protested when the owner of the Hangman’s Tree was going to change the name. Fun fact, the actual stump of the popular hanging tree is still in the building. Idk. I think you could have picked a stronger argument than that. I guess we will have to agree to disagree."
unpopularopinion,fn4srgd,t1_fn4m8fe,1586648166.0,"Culture is defined as everything we have, think, and do. What people have=material possessions; what people think=ideas, values, and attitudes; and what people do=behavior patterns. There are over 160 definitions of culture, but this one is most widely accepted in the anthropological field. When I say that our identity is 100% related to culture, I mean that culture is holistic in that it is many different things (cultures and subcultures) that make up the big picture, which is us. For example, we all belong to subcultures: think about how you are in terms of your family, your work, your religion, your class status, your age, etc. and maybe you identify with a larger cultural group, such as Mexican American. Culture is inherently valuable because it is related to everything we have, think, and do. 

As far as the time period versus culture thing: I meant that gold miner culture is still present because there are still people who mine for gold. Therefore, those that are gold miners relate to other gold miners and can share cultural values based off of that. I would argue that this is a subculture that is the product of a larger culture, but a culture nonetheless. Saying that gold miner culture doesn’t exist anymore just isn’t true. So random lol. 

I really appreciated this conversation because it really highlights that culture is taken for granted. It is deeply imbedded in our psyche and how we act and what we think are often habitual as a result of enculturation."
unpopularopinion,fn3xcw1,t1_fn3v5j1,1586629774.0,"I’m absolutely arguing that. Your identity is 100% linked to culture. Everything is your life is part of one culture or another. If culture is erased, so is part of your identity. Gold miner culture totally exists as people still mine for gold. The Gold Rush was a period of time in California that brought great diversity to the state and that period of time no longer exists. If Native Americans are actively practicing their cultural traditions, they won’t fade away. If you encourage people to not practice their cultural traditions, those traditions fade over time and get forgotten. Consequently, those people lose sight of their cultural heritage and eventually the culture is erased overall. It’s called cultural genocide, which is usually forced as it was with Native Americans."
unpopularopinion,fn3mw8d,t1_fn3cfus,1586623912.0,"Yeah that’s what I was thinking too. Also, if culture isn’t expressed by younger generations, it gets forgotten or erased. If people are forced to assimilate to one culture, their own culture gets erased, i.e. Native American cultures reduced to due to forced assimilation and genocide."
unpopularopinion,fn3llzl,t3_fz33c7,1586623196.0,"So first off, race and ethnicity are different. Race is based off of a person’s physical characteristics, such as skin color, and ethnicity is based off of cultural factors, such as nationality and ancestry. I think having culture clubs on campuses is important for people to feel included rather than isolated, especially while living in a world where ethnocentrism is rampant and leads to racial prejudice and stereotyping, which can be detrimental and dangerous for minorities. As far as the clubs go, it’s a way for students to feel comfortable and celebrate their heritage and it’s also a way for other students to learn about different cultures. In a country like the US, where communities are becoming more and more diverse, clubs give students a chance to express their cultural heritage as multicultural awareness grows."

Also, the whole player tracking thing is largely for player evaluations and other stats for machine placement throughout the floor. The usb that determines pay ratio is also locked behind a door inside the slot machine that only the gaming commission has access to. So all this talk about casinos being able to “flip the win switch” is garbage. They would have to bring their laptop to every single machine to change the odds, which would take weeks depending on the size of the casino. People are just pissed that they see 99% payback on a casino billboard and don’t realize that means over the lifetime of the machine, not the lifetime of your current trip."

This definitely taught me how to be concise in my writing. The first thing I do is figure out what my thesis is and then create my body out of that in my outline. Typically your professors will want you to provide quotes as your concrete evidence so I’ll usually find material that fits my thesis and then have a spot underneath in my outline that analyzes each one to tie into my thesis. Then I just have to string it all together in each body paragraph so that it makes sense. I write the intro and conclusion last to ensure that they include everything I wrote about. This is what worked best for me and really makes essay writing easy.

facepalm,fjkjbt0,t3_fdt6uy,1583427936.0,"Actually, you can tell a lot about an animal’s diet by their dentition. The teeth that are most associated with diet are posterior (molars and premolars) because of their role in mastication (chewing). Bunodont teeth have low, rounded cusps and are usually associated with omnivorous animals such as the peccary; selenodont teeth are elongated with ridges and are most useful for cutting through leafy vegetation. You’ll find these teeth in animals such as goats and cows. Humans have heterodont dentition, which means that we have teeth specialized for different functions, i.e. incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. They allow us to eat a variety of different foods. Meat consumption allowed the early human ancestors to grow larger brains because they were able to be fuller, longer due to its high protein content. They started out by eating leftover meat from carcasses discarded by other animals and slowly began hunting after the development of tools, such as the Oldowan tool, which is the first tool that we know of. If our earliest ancestors hadn’t eaten meat, we never would have evolved into what we are today."

The best thing about group settings is that so many share situations and stories that I can totally relate to and it makes me feel less bad because other people are struggling with the same things that I am.

BPD,finug9z,t1_finptkf,1582570400.0,"It only helps if you’re willing to put in the work. Learning what the skills are only helps if you’re willing to actively practice them. I really struggled with mindfulness at first. After awhile, I would reflect during the sessions and realize that I had made progress without even realizing it and now mindfulness is just a part of everyday life. You got this! The smallest wins add up to the largest change over time."

BPD,finu5ti,t1_finp2lm,1582570233.0,This. I also dropped out of school and went back recently and am going to graduate in May after a 6 year break from college. I’m proud of you! Things don’t stop being hard but they feel more manageable after learning the skills.
