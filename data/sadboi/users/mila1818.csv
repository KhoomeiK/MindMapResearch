Obviously body shapes vary across all genders but it does make sense to have broad terms for men‚Äôs clothes and women‚Äôs clothes - there are always going to be distinctions and requirements that make sense for the vast majority of people.
What most men need in a button down shirt isn‚Äôt what most women need in a button down shirt it‚Äôs often simpler to have broad terms to separate those requirements than not. 
That isn‚Äôt to disregard the requirement of trans or non binary people etc - you can still buy and wear whatever you want to and works for you. 
This just isn‚Äôt the case for razors / water bottles / face masks and so on, where gendering items tends to solely be a deliberate marketing ploy"
