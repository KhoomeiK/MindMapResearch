I have been diagnosed with ASPD at the age of 18
I can tell you with full certainty that no online test that gives access to anyone will give you the right results, if they did, you’d probably have over 400 different disorders.

Getting tested by a professional is way different and the only sure way to get a diagnosis.

Self diagnosing can be a scary thing since you start believing in your own lies. These tests are often made to let you score way higher than usual

Also I actually scored quite low."

sociopath,fhs308v,t3_f4f7h6,1581851291.0,"1. I have been diagnosed with ASPD but I couldn’t  really see how, since I actually have some close friends and a girlfriend I thought I loved.

2. All of them accept sensitivity. I used to have a really short fuse and almost always threatened to kill someone over small things. I would stay in a blind rage for hours over small problems.
But with age, and increased wisdom most people say they perceive me as ‘relaxed’ ‘calm’ and ‘stoic’.

3. I am pretty sure this happened later in life.
I vaguely remember that at around age 14-15 I had a terrible time at school
(whilst being popular) 
And lots of verbal and sometimes physical abuse at home.
I got in a great depression and got really insecure, but overtime I began to love the way I looked. I thought I was better in things than other people.. even though this clearly wasn’t the case.
This combined with weakened emotions my psychologist called ‘flat emotions’ caused the first signs of narcissism.

4. As stated earlier, I was diagnosed at age 18.
The only rime I wouldn’t be the way I am is when I go do artsy things with my friends.
I am an artist myself, and I really like it. But I can’t feel emotions through it. 
An abstract painting? My friends can totally connect with it. For me it’s just a painting, this too goes for music. I can however feel emotional through series, especially when I can find a character I can relate with. These aren’t strong emotions, but it’s something.

5. Am I cool? Hell yeah I’m cool."

(I’m actually a really chill and relaxed guy) 
For some reason it’s a turn on for some women.
Ofcourse it’s also really trendy to have a mental condition and socio/psychopaths are shown in media as these ‘misunderstood sensitive guys’.
This creates an ideal image for edgy girl or girl who think they can ‘fix’ them.
Example: this one girl liked me because I reminded her of some character from American Horror story. 
I haven’t watched the show, neither am I planning to.
But the character seemed exactly like you’d have guessed. An edgy guy who cares for no-one except this one girl.

I naturally began thinking this was and later found out there is a name for it.
It boils down to ‘what I can’t change shouldn’t take my energy trying to change it’.

This works especially good with anger.
Someone you are angry at? Fuck ‘em. Let them sit in their own sorrow, leave them in the dust.
It’s not your problem, so don’t waste your energy on it.

I had a girlfriend of 2 years. We recently broke up.
That aside she mentioned something that made me think. She said ‘our relationship is more like a friendship with lots of sex’.

Ofcourse I told her it was nonsense and that I loved her way more. So she asked in what way I loved her differently.

This is where I kinda chocked.
I am sure this is what I would call love. 
But maybe what I call ‘love’ is just as strong as ‘friendship’ is for NP’s? 

TLDR: Yes we (I) can love, but it’s probably not the same strength as an NP would feel."
sociopath,ezjlbxs,t3_d18dc5,1567946411.0,"Not a ‘sociopathic’ solution.. just mine.
I am very nihilistic and don’t see much point in anything.. that’s exactly why doing stupid shit works so well.
For example taking a tattoo or taking drugs.

People will say ‘you are ruining your body’ ‘you know that tattoo stays right?’ ‘Drugs are bad for you’.

But if life doesn’t matter, what does doing stupid shit mean? Nothing. 
So just have fun, do irrational things (non criminal preferably) and just do shit you like.

Maybe it’s from a wrong viewpoint since I care little about the consequences. But that’s the point ain’t it? If you want a cool tattoo, or go wild on alchohol, just do it. It doesn’t matter what happens after aslong as you have fun at the moment.
