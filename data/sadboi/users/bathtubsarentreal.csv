My brother is on the spectrum and when I was describing my OCD feelings to him right when they started he was getting over his and told me it was normal, turns out both my brother and father had it in childhood and being a lady I was just more likely to have it and keep it (OCD) after puberty. I could definitely see myself on the spectrum still! My brother just recently was diagnosed and I haven't tried to be yet (as a lady I think stuff can go unnoticed more as well), but it would explain a lot of things. My comment was more along the lines of, ""I kinda remember doing something I didn't do and know I shouldn't do but even though I didn't do it I am kinda confused if I maybe did and if this person also experiences this maybe I didn't do the thing!"""

Raynauds,fo8gljb,t3_g6aroi,1587596158.0,"Physical exercise sometimes prevents a ""loss"" but personally for me the biggest issue when it comes to ""losing"" toes and fingers is how wet the cold air is, if that makes sense. If it's dry and cold my feet/hands will hurt and be purple, if I'm in a humid but cold area they will also lose their blood. 

Sometimes exercise will prevent a loss, sometimes it will help a loss? It's very fickle. 

As far as temperature goes, usually anything below 72 will cause cold/slight pain/loss/less dexterity, with below 55~ (maybe?) Causing a lot of pain

The people who I think are shitty parents are the ones trying to live life the same way they were before kids, going to bars and breweries with friends all the time and hitting up intense hikes that a child isn't capable of doing, living in apartments around other younger adults and not having enough money set aside for a comfortable life with an additional expensive human being.
