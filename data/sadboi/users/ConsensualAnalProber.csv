I also wonder where all that hair goes when she wears short wigs for cosplay, I *might* think (if she had extensions) they would be clip ins to get out easier for cosplay and day to day life. However the scene of her mother washing her hair show no clips, or changes in density/length, which makes me think sew ins or micro beads. All of which damage the hair.


We can also see how fast (or slowly) her fringe/bangs have grown which doesnt correlate to the overall increase in the length of her hair since treatment. 


She says she usually has her hair washed at a salon/hair dressers (ED exhaustion and too much money) which would add weight to the theory of extentions. Most people clean their hair at least once a week (POC may vary) and it is perfect on stream twice a week, so she probably goes to the salon at least weekly. 


Shes mentioned going to the dentist a few times- and her mother once bought her gag teeth which I found odd.

Her brother is diagnosed autistic (no stigma here.) which could result in medication. Her mother doesnt have a public diagnosis but has symptoms of behavioural issues and/or substance abuse.

I dont envy her pain or the awful things she must be going through, but seeing her is so hard not to want to be like her. Shes emulated everything every pro ana wanted to be, and theres no way she doesnt know that.

OCD,fpnh201,t1_fpmg973,1588762623.0,"I'm not diagnosed with any compulsive disorders, however I am diagnosed with BPD, an ED, and anxiety (as well as others I'd rather not get into) which manifest with compulsive and obsessive tendencies.

BPD manifests with some obsessive and compulsive behaviour, I believe in part due to our occasional delusions. Personally I have spent 3 hours crying, re painting my nails, because each time I'd end up with a single chip and convince myself it was a sign of how worthless I was that other people would pick up on. I'd then have to remove polish from all my nails and toenails and start again so that I could be ""good"". To an outsider this may sound like OCD, but its cause was mood disturbances and low self esteem, which is what I used to determine it from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. BPD can also cause ritualistic self harm, which can be a symptom of OCD (as a compulsion), however again the cause of the symptom is what distinguishes it.


EDs (eating disorders) have a high co morbidity with OCD, but also have obsessive compulsive cycles alone that are labeld as rituals sometimes. For bulimics, it may be an obsession with weight which manifests with a compulsion to hoard and restrict food, which triggers a binge (eating a large quantity of food) which can trigger another compulsive purging to soothe the trigger from the obsession of weight management. Anorexics have a similar cycle, of obsessively fearing weight gain, which they subdue with compulsive weight checks, body checks, weighing/positioning food, etc. 


In both cases (BPD & EDs) there are obsessive compulsive traits, and a disorder, however the obsessive compulsions are caused by a separate disorder which I believe is what distinguishes them from OCD.


I also have heard that OCD can be caused by structural neurological abnormalities which would help to further exclude other diagnosis', however I do not believe SNAs are present in all people with OCD and I was only told this anecdotally from a man with OCD and an SNA which he  believed to be related.

I treat this ""regressed me"", the childhood me, as an ""alter"" because I feel I truely dont know her. I read a lot on here about treating your inner child, taking care of or healing them from the trauma they experienced, but that can be really hard to do when your inner child becomes your entire mind and thought process. All they want to do is cry and lash out and be held. When I see photos of myself at that age, I recognise them, but not as myself. I see a childhood photo and think ""oh, XYX looked uncomfortable/happy/confused there"" with XYZ being what I call my inner child/child self.


I know it sounds really weird, but I think it may be a trauma mechanism. It's easier as adults to not carry all that pain, fear, and suffering if you can dis-associate from the child who went through it. I think the brain locks it into a separate space so that we can grow ""new"" selves in our non abusive enviroments, instead of fourcing our abuse survivor child into adult life to face even more stress.

 ""Cis passing"" (problematic term) trans people are still a part of the LGBT+ community, lesbians and gays who arent currently dating are still a part of the LGBT+ community, and so excluding bisexuals from it for dating(or not dating) a certain gender at any given time can not be disguised as anything but rampant biphobia. 


I hope no one minds me saying that I've noticed mixed people suffer something similar- I am not a POC and absolutely do not mean to speak for anyone who is, this is purely my observation of my mixed friends and family. 


""Light skin"" or mixed POC tend to receive a similar level of ostracization from both POC and white people, which I think psychologically is similar to what bisexuals experience, because both groups interpret you as different from them rather than each seeing you as similar to them. I'm not saying bisexuals experience prejudice on par with racism- at all.

 I didnt realise it was such a deeply emotional subject for you, given you're usually so grounded and logical, nor that the embarrassment I caused you could make you feel you had to run away from the meal. I hadnt considered how personal you might take, but now realise how hard it must have hit your ego, and the shame it must have caused. I promise you that this was not my intention.

CPTSD,fov9khi,t3_g9k2gr,1588097633.0,"Absolutely. I hear you, and relate.

While it was parental figures who let me down, professionals did just as much. When my CI began to flare for the first time, but I hadnt been diagnosed, several health professionals and family members thought I ""just had an ED"". Where as, when I saught help after years of a real ED, I was asked if I had ""ever been under weight"" and left with advice to work out more. Both of these caused me months, if not years, of exacerbated physical and mental pain. 


I think on some level it comes down to feeling my pain is being ignored or invalidated, which is bad enough from a bystander, but from a professional is absolutely shattering. 


It has played a part in my trauma, because one of my biggest (if not THE biggest) triggers I have currently is not being believed or heard by people in any position in my life. Whether is be about letting me down on a mental health front, or dismissing my pain, or claiming to not believe my child abuse (what child lies about that?), it drives me up the wall.

I was originally given oramorph for IBD and after switching around got far too comfortable with codeine. I was 14 at the time, which I think made doctors assume that asking for opiates wasnt an addictive thing. I stopped taking them when I was about 17, and since have only used cocodamol twice and refuse to have it in my house because I know it is possible to separate the codeine from the paracetamol and dont trust myself.


I'm sorry you've had such an awful time having your pain taken seriously, are you in a country without free healthcare? I've noticed a difference between opioid addictions in the US and UK (mostly online, but I lived 2 years in the states) which I think may be related to insurance. I'm not sure though, so please dont take this as fact.


I hope you can get the relief you need soon, and that you find a doctor who listens to you. God knows how hard it is to find a doctor with a sane stance on pain medication, I'm still searching."

I painted this small chest of drawers and file holder with white paint for my new house. They looked a little dull afterward, so I cut out some foil leaf shapes (which are paper on the back) to attatch to both.

I was originally planning to wallpaper glue them on (thin layer of wall paper glue on the back, and another thin layer on top to secure them) but I'm not sure how the ""glue"" would work on wood, let alone wood that has been painted.


Do any crafters have any tips? They dont need to look perfect because I'm the only one who will be seeing them, however I'm afraid that if I go in with wall paper glue it may damage the integrity of the paint if the leaves peal off.
