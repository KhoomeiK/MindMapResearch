I'm sure there's some type of stereotype that's associated with how I dress and look, and although most stereotypes are usually based off some truth- stereotypes aren't always accurate. 
I appreciate you trying tho, bud. At least that gives me some sort of idea of what some people might think when they see me..."

I would just recommend taking a few breaths or maybe just try listening to some calming music or music that makes you feel happy? Perhaps even trying taking a break from the internet, sometimes too much time online or on social media gets me in a bad mood... 
It could help reduce the toxicity/negativity you might be feeling, or help improve your mood, That's all. 
Have a nice day!"

You seem like the type of person who'd be a fan of horror movies...

I feel like you would have a fun personality, and you would get a little silly sometimes :) 

I also feel like you'd be the type of person to be protective and loving of you friends, like you'd be there to defend them fiercely. 

Your style makes me think of alternative subculture, like maybe goth?

mentalillness,fpa8wax,t1_fp90mbi,1588443186.0,"I can understand that, but the first time someone asked me this it wasn't the case. Which is why it's on this list. 

There was this really toxic person in my life at the time, and when they found out about my PTSD(without me personally telling this person, or knowing that they had found out might I add) they confronted me about my diagnosis, and asked me ""why I was going around spreading false information about myself"" and that I was romanticizing a mental illness(let me remind you that I hadn't personally told this person about my diagnosis, so I had no idea what they were even talking about- the only people I had told about my diagnosis were very few close friends and family that I trusted for support and understanding) when I had denied doing any such thing, and asked what the hell they were going on about- they decided to inform me that I in fact wasn't diagnosed with PTSD and that ""I should stop going around telling everyone about it"" When I had realised what was happening I argued with this person for quite some time, but eventually decided that this conversation wasn't worth the stress and simply walked away. 

Unfortunately the situation didn't end there because-
They would proceed to harass me about my diagnosis every time they saw me or whenever we'd interact with each other, and they refused to stop unless I ""admitted I was a liar and a attention whore""


This person was so determined to disprove and invalidate me and my diagnosis that there was a point when they would demand physical proof that I was diagnosed with PTSD, like they expected me to call my psychiatrist so that a professional could tell this person whether or not I was lying about my diagnosis or not. When I had refused to do this (because it was disrespectful and a waste of my psychiatrist's time) this person demanded to see the personal diagnosis papers for my PTSD...


Anyways, long story short: I now understand that not everyone is going to react in the same why this person did, but when I had written that part onto the list- in my mind there was a reason for it. I apologize for the lack of context in it; like I said, I feel that this list came off more passive aggressive than intentioned."

Although I feel you probably already know this, I just wanted to make sure I tell you that you are valid, and so is your diagnosis. No one has the right to make you feel worthless. 
Your thoughts, feeling, and hardships are valid- no matter what other individuals may tell you, please remember that üíï"
