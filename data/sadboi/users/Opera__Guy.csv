Has anyone had this problem? I just reinstalled and am looking to try it out and see if that helped. It completely crashes my PC and reboots my computer (yikes!).

Graphics card is up to date, I'm not running it too hot or graphics too high.

I've searched a bit and it looks like ONE other person I've found said that the Legacy challenge can do this around gen 3/4, but how do people like Claire Siobhan get so far down with it?

They said it might be a corrupt save, but I don't know how to check if it is.
