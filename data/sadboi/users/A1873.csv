OCPoetry,fo9xm5m,t3_g4jzjc,1587634219.0,"You know I wasn’t into this the first few times I read it but I gotta say the bitterness grew on me (no pun intended lol). 

As someone who really doesn’t like flowers the title immediately caught my attention. I found it pretty comical and light hearted, and I expected the poem to build on that comedy and I was kinda let down that it didn’t. I feel like the frustration and darkness that you’re trying to portray is really watered down by the title. I think that that disjointed tone between the title and the poem is the biggest problem here for me. Once I read it a few times and started trying to forget the title and just focus on the words I started to see it more clearly and actually enjoy it.

Over all I did like it."
OCPoetry,fo9vl1l,t3_g6hz3x,1587632660.0,"I really love this interpretation of love and (the way it resonates with me) that worry of not being enough. And the fault of not being enough falling like halfway on circumstance and halfway on you, or I guess me is what I’m really saying.

The way it’s formatted as like an introduction almost, starting and ending with “it’s important for me to tell you”, I think that works extremely well at putting us into your head or putting into words a piece of our own. 

I think my favorite part of this is that recurring line “my love for you will not protect us”. I feel like that can hit different kinds of people in different ways. It can elude to a few kinds of inadequacy. I see it as in one way being a slightly more literal one to the scenarios described in the poem, a financial or situational sense where love isn’t enough to pull you together, or enough to keep someone around. And another way as a warning almost, a warning in the sense that this is a sort of greeting in the way I interpret it to be. Something like, “I love you, I really do but like, fuck, I know some switch is gonna flip in me and I’m gonna fuck you and what we have up regardless of my love because I know the kind of person I am.” 
It reminds me of a song I really love called The Bourne Identity by The Last Shadow Puppets that has the lyrics 
“Now I know jealousy 
I caught you talking to the real me
Can’t tell you how 
unhappy that shit makes me
If you hear him calling 
promise you’ll ignore him 
He’s kinda my enemy 
Any time I’m onto
something good, you see
he always waltz’s in
to spoil it for me”

The only place I felt a bit lost was the last stanza where things got more specific and I’m guessing more personal, and that’s probably the reason I felt lost there because what was being said was not really translatable to my experience. Which is totally fine, I love poetry that’s oddly specific and personal, that’s kinda the style I write in. 

I really did love this a lot, got a feeling it’ll stick with me. Great stuff."
