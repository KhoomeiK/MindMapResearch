And these schools can’t take *everyone* but they do take majority of them so they become over represented. Among the in’tl pool, its mostly Asians (Japanese, Chinese, Indians etc). 

Let’s look at this another way; if you go on some college websites they’ll actually tell you how much students from each country was chose to attend their school and even on the international page right underneath the diversity section you mainly see Asians than any other region and they make up most of the student body depending on which school you’re really looking at."

But one day I went to get something to drink and walked away but I went to the check how much change left and realized that the lady took my change by mistake so I was going to get it back but I shook it off and walked back home (like 10 seconds away) and in that 10 seconds as I closed my gate, seven gun shots rung out. Lady and her son was shot dead. Just thinking about how I was going back for change made me think that I too might be riddled with bullets."

ApplyingToCollege,fnfwv2m,t3_g1dymr,1586917182.0,"Unfortunately the most affordable schools for me (in’tl) is ivies, Stanford and MIT that give generous amount of scholarships or aid for a low income student like me. I could care less about the prestige or the name, I was looking for a way for my parents to not get in debt but they are very hard to get into so I gave up entirely because I couldn’t compete with the others so I’m just applying to state schools and low tier schools."

BadRPerStories,fnc3j05,t1_fnbqmk2,1586827856.0,I had to admit I did have characters that were fragile and innocent when I started out roleplaying but I got sick of girls relying on someone to do everything for them so I started making my characters with a little more balls to actually to not take shit from anybody but it gets over looked many times.
BadRPerStories,fnc34j6,t1_fnbpajl,1586827613.0,"As I said, it’s an example, I didn’t actually write it like that since I left the role play and couldn’t remember what I wrote. But in addition to THAT reply I specified that my character indeed was going to duel with the man but my partner stepped in and killed him (despite the man being more powerful than both of us) in an instant."

ApplyingToCollege,fn91acy,t1_fn90z7q,1586756177.0,"The application fee isn’t the problem. The SAT with writing is, since the rest of my colleges don’t require it I didn’t feel like gambling my SAT in a first try and score badly to do it over again. 

And even if I got in that would make me happy but I won’t go, hopefully, the other colleges I chose (state colleges) accept me and I can get a scholarship :)

Thanks for the advice though!"

ApplyingToCollege,fn3drcg,t1_fn2bh8w,1586618640.0,"I know this girl (she’s black) she got into two ivies, duke, UCLA and Rice. Though her white peers think that it’s because of affirmative action. Her gpa wasn’t low but it wasn’t high either but he had some damn good extracurriculars (I think lmao) since she wanted to do neuroscience. Honestly, I’m black also and if I happen to get into a high tier school and some person come screaming AFFIRMATIVE ACTION in my face I’ll ignore them."
