Drugs,f4pvt4a,t3_dl3ny1,1571743761.0,I'm sure we are all guilty of using drugs for the weight loss benefit as well. I was taking but was still eating normally so I decided to go on a 4 month binge too (Crystal meth) but only drinking water and eating yogurt and muslie. I was so unhappy with myself and my weight that I managed to lose 15kgs and it changed everything for me. I stopped using but made sure I kept healthy and ate only once a day. Now I'm happy with my weight.

AskReddit,f12qnok,t3_d7n494,1569144863.0,"It's hard to explain unless you've been through it. It feels like someone is standing on your chest, you Don't know how you're still breathing, and suddenly the whole world has turned into a constant nightmare that you can't wake up from. Grief can effect your entire life. Memories start to fade and then suddenly you forget what their voice used to sound like but you can see their face every time you close your eyes. In my opinion it gets worse over time not better, missing them more and more as each day goes by."

AskReddit,ey2l8sb,t3_cv8xpq,1566742444.0,Yes. In a different kind of way tho. My boyfriend turned me into a drug addict and I completely lost my mind. I tried to commit suicide and landed up in a coma. Woke up after a week and had aspirational pnemonia I was in icu for a month.
AskReddit,exycvc4,t3_cuqrco,1566650510.0,"Funny enough, my imaginary friend was myself, like my other personality. She was popular, smart, interesting, she was a singer and everyone wanted to be around her cause she was liked by everyone. She looked exactly like me and spoke the same way I did and I was her best friend. I used to make tape recordings of us speaking to each other. She never left. Later in life I was diagnosed with a split personality disorder, it made sense. Shes still around."

AskReddit,exy7qmh,t3_cuqscj,1566648397.0,"My sleep paralysis experiences have mostly consisted of several hands under my blanket trying to grab me. Ive also had my cat that passed away come and sit on my chest. It felt like hours and is so terrifying. However there was 4 occasions where I saw the demon. My demon is this tall, black, snake skin creature with no eyes and its spine stuck out that it couldn't stand straight so it was always leaning forward. It kept trying to get directly on top of me. It had a large purple tongue, that looked like an eel and it was trying stick it down my throat. I would try keep my mouth shut but the last time it came to visit me, it managed to shove it's eel like tongue down my throat and it caused me to stop breathing. Luckily the ""suffocation"" woke me up. Its like being in a horror movie, these experiences scar me and its so hard to describe how it really feels cause most people haven't experienced real supernatural terror."
