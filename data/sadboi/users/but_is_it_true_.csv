RedditForGrownups,f17h10l,t3_d84ena,1569242715.0,"I just lost my sister, 33, to suicide in July. When someone sent me a message of their condolences and they care, it was enough for me. Beyond that, I really didn't want to deal with. They, more than likely, don't know how to respond to people. This is such a horrifying and tragic loss that it's difficult for everyone. I'm sorry for your loss."
