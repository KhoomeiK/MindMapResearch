depression,ffw79cg,t3_eva4ra,1580287643.0,"I feel the same. I'm not good in anything therefore I lose interest in any kind of activities cus I know I'm not good enough and probably never will. My psychotherapist told me that it's a bad attitude cus I will end up being useless if I won't do anything but I just don't want to be bad at something and I know that my attitude is bad cus it won't get me anywhere but every time I start doing something with it I see how bad I am at it and it just drags me down and I just stop I wish I could change that but I don't know how I also stopped going to psychotherapist last week cus these talks with him made me recall everything that I was thinking of when I was sad and see how other ppl are really awesome at what they are doing e.g my gf she's just great at singing, drawing, playing the guitar (even when just hearing the song and not having the notes to play) and this all thing got me thinking like it's all pointless and I just live for my family not to be sad and for my gf even more because I know she might kill herself and I just want her to be happy and nothing more because I know that I won't be happy anymore."
FreeKarma4U,ffw670c,t1_fftpsi5,1580286184.0,What just happened cus I wrote only one comment lol

depression,ff144sq,t3_eqxc9u,1579475046.0,"I can relate, and even though I don't have any dreams I just feel like that's my perfect dream cus it's like I just don't have to live. it's just like being dead without having anyone worried about you and crying, that's why it's so great."
depression,fdxqvny,t3_en7336,1578771994.0,Maybe that's because  that's because one part of you want to be happy but on the other hand you could just lost hope for feeling better and you just gave up and judging from my and other people expieriences it's really common and easy for people with depression
depression,fdm6dop,t1_fdlwtsi,1578540901.0,"It's so me, and even when I start doing something I end up doing a simple task for a week at least."

PewdiepieSubmissions,fd94vvw,t1_fd94get,1578228448.0,"Yes, but these are exceptions. In general women are weaker than men because men don't find muscular women attractive"
PewdiepieSubmissions,fd8zvhl,t3_ekakho,1578226045.0,"You know that it's actually because women are physically weaker than men, so in situations like that it's understandable that they can't be treated equally"

depression,fc6dk73,t3_eg1ib1,1577478043.0,My girlfriend gets really obsessed when I'm sad and she gets mad at me because she says that I have no reason to be sad and maybe that's true maybe I'm just a crybaby and I feel low for no reason
depression,fc5cexa,t3_eg9dzt,1577453186.0,I love someone and she loves me but I still can't understand why she loves me and also I can't stop hating myself because I feel like I just can't do anything right and I'm not good in anything that I do and I just don't matter I have and nothing motivates me to do anything because I know I will be shut at it and now sleep is my favourite activity because then I can forget about everything and literally not live without having anyone worried or sad

PewdiepieSubmissions,fabaa91,t3_e893q2,1575920154.0,It doesn't matter if someone listened to his music earlier or not it just means that they have a lot of respect for him and he left a part of him in his music and they feel like they have known him for years and it's good that even people that didn't listen to him are sad because of his death it only shows how good rapper and most importantly human he was
