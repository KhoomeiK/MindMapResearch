teenagers,fkq2o2n,t3_fk0pxw,1584428010.0,You good my dude?
BPD,ffs5y80,t3_euuwob,1580173956.0,I love you too.
BorderlinePDisorder,ffowon3,t3_eueqsa,1580082665.0,For me I hold on to the person way after we break up even when I have found someone else.
BPD,ffoiey9,t3_eubrm8,1580077933.0,I'm here
BPD,ffjuy7t,t1_ffjtmig,1580007659.0,Could it be possible to prevent the person from changing the status of the relationship?
BPD,ffjtj01,t1_ffjsura,1580006536.0,Damn I'm sorry you had to go through that.
BPD,ffjjy5j,t1_ffjjuey,1579999929.0,That is an interesting way to describe it.
BPD,ffjjvtj,t1_ffjieeg,1579999887.0,Oh wow you are so lucky to have found someone who understands you.
BPD,ffje46n,t3_etufog,1579996339.0,Yes I wish my friends could see that I'm not trying to be a screw up.
relationship_advice,ffhe10r,t1_ffhbps7,1579931436.0,Ok yeah maybe I didn't completely want to break up.
BPD,ffgfl5n,t3_ethhv3,1579905125.0,I feel the same. I'm here.
relationship_advice,ffg86k1,t1_ffg7tid,1579900549.0,It was mutual.
BPD,ffegoet,t1_ffeghe6,1579847295.0,Yeah true it reduces my anxiety as well.
BPD,ff7t282,t3_es4b8r,1579657674.0,"I too have imaginary siblings and I talk to my book characters and I also have built up a whole ""my life is a TV show"" thing and there's ships and all those little attributes of a tv show and sometimes I do ""interviews"" breaking down specific scenes and their importance to the show."
BPDmemes,ff7ss5z,t3_es3i68,1579657482.0,"How brave of you to assume that us BPDers know whether or not we've actually been in love or whether we've just glorified a person to a degree that makes you think ""Is this love? I'm obsessed with them so it must be"". No hate on anyone we've all been there."
BPDmemes,ff79bdu,t1_ff6rc8a,1579643740.0,Same
BPDmemes,ff540dg,t1_ff4qqlt,1579579610.0,You ok?
BPD,felkzb5,t1_feljs0h,1579224683.0,Spending time with the other guy made me compare him to my bf and I guess that did lead to disappointment in him because he wasn't like the other guy. I didn't really move on with the other guy because he actually distanced himself from me to get over me. But now that I've broken up with my now ex he has come back into the picture and has revealed he is not completely over me.
BPD,fejw98u,t1_feiwgk2,1579187298.0,Yeah I do but like sometimes it's not enough.
BPD,feiyyz6,t1_feiyhir,1579151194.0,Well things are starting off with the other guy and I'm hoping I can be better this time around.
BPD,feix1d7,t1_feiwonu,1579149555.0,Perhaps I am being overdramatic but now there is no chance at changing it since we agreed it was better to break up cause we don't talk much anymore cause he doesn't have his phone and he probably wouldn't trust me since he knows about the other guy.
BPD,feiw9s4,t1_feiw00m,1579148937.0,Not giving me attention. I don't mean to sound needy but there's a certain amount of attention that you have to pay to your significant other that he didn't give me.
BPD,feivl24,t1_feiu4uq,1579148404.0,He makes me feel like he doesn't care about me.
BorderlinePDisorder,fehu2nd,t1_fehil6z,1579123879.0,Maybe more of a social anxiety thing.
BPD,fegr7l9,t3_eoxp7s,1579100637.0,I have the same problem. Whenever anyone asks me to describe myself I completely blank out.
BorderlinePDisorder,fegr39p,t3_eoz4ok,1579100553.0,I go through the same thing. I have even prepared lists of thing I can talk about but they all fly out the window when we're together.
BPD,fefozjf,t3_eo2wyt,1579061213.0,DAE talk to their friends about their SO all sweet and nice and then all of a sudden it turns into trash talk about them?
relationships_advice,fefak5h,t1_fef89i4,1579052053.0,Your dedication to wanting me to pick him is beyond anything I've ever seen from my friends concerning my love life.
crocheting,fef8j2o,t3_eoi7um,1579050707.0,Very nice color scheme
BPD,fef707b,t1_fef6qpr,1579049675.0,No he honestly hasn't ever wronged me. Just little annoyances that get blown out of proportion I guess.
BPD,fe4j3r3,t3_enothb,1578859878.0,Yes I do the same thing and my friends hate my boyfriend because of it. You are not alone here.
