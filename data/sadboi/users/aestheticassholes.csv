The fetus is inside of the body, it is taking nutrients from the mother, the fetus depends on the mother. Without the woman there is no fetus. That’s what’s I’m trying to say. A woman should have a right to her body, and what inhabits inside of it. A doctor can’t just tell you “you have a worm inside you, but you can’t get rid of it” or the government saying, “we don’t care how you feel, you will have this worm inside you”. Anything to do with abortion has to do with a woman’s rights."

Abortiondebate,es1g5my,t3_c5cmkw,1561496070.0,"I beg to differ. This directly effects women, making this a huge woman’s rights issue. A lot of this is just power. I agree any woman who will die if not given an abortion is a valid reason, but I think almost any reason is a valid one (minus just using abortion as a use of *repetitive* contraceptive). 
We are told “if you don’t want a baby- don’t have sex” but sex isn’t always about reproducing. It’s MY RIGHT to do with my body as I please. If I want to have consensual sex with a partner and I fall pregnant and I am not in a stable environment, don’t have enough income, or just not ready/don’t want to be a parent it is my right to decide what happens WITHIN MY OWN BODY.

This is being conscious of our resources and of the “child” as you so put it (I disagree, it’s a fetus. But that isn’t the debate). If a child wasn’t wanted, but born that child could be exposed to a lot of pain and suffering. We as a species are depleting our recorded at a terrifying rate. What everyone really cares about is money, so I’ll skip to that. People who aren’t financially stable get income from the government, and everyone bitches about the extra taxes for government funding to low income families. 

Abortion is painted to be a horrific bloodbath, but the “baby” or “child” (again, I say fetus) is humanly euthanized. They are spared of a life which could be full of horror. I say that this is a needed thing. 

Why are we so focused on unborn fetus’s when we could be looking at the people who are actually alive, who actually feel. Those who are being trafficked for sex, those who are being beaten by their spouses, those who are hurting emotionally or mentally. This isn’t even the beginning of who we can help, what about aliens fleeing from their country to flee violence, what about children who go hungry every night. Why don’t we focus on them? Why? We focus on abortion rights because women directly effect the population. What do politicians need. Votes. To get those votes, they need more people. Women are being controlled. When speaking on this topic, a lot of people fail to realize how many fertile eggs are thrown away by in-vitro clinics. They don’t care, because it isn’t inside a woman."
