Over the years, in my experience, it seems to be a more blatant problem in Islamic countries because of the more authoritarian psychology of Islam. I remember a Muslim classmate telling me that Islam means ""to submit"". I'm sure many Totalitarian regimes would love to impose such a faith on their people. Even if those who embrace it are in the minority, they can still impose their will on the rest through latent fear from the teachings of the faith."

You obviously have some deep-seated issue yourself, and your analysis of the characters is wrong.

How in the hell is Yuri in control of us/you? You are partially right about the raccoon poem being a metaphor for her self-harm (but that's hardly news now), but the rest of what you said makes no sense at all. Yuri is intense, but deeply shy and quiet. The raccoon could be seen as either the player, or her urge to hurt herself. I wager the latter, given that it starts appearing more and more. She says herself in act two that she was made to feel ashamed for wearing her heart on her sleeve as a child, and suppressing her emotions and urges comes at the price of self-harm. She was trying to tell you that she needed help, but couldn't just say it because she was afraid of being ostracised.

Natsuki just wants to be taken seriously by others despite her hobby supposedly being looked down on by many. The act 2 stuff with her dad was most likely a corruption of her backstory code by Monika, but still shows just how alone she feels.

To say Sayori is being manipulative in that fashion is pretty disgusting, tbh. While it's true that she did cajole you into joining the club, she did it because she wanted to see you interact with others more so you would be happy - Something she struggled to do on her own, and we all know how much that means to her. If she couldn't make you happy, then she would have failed in her mind... the problem came when she realised that she was in love with you, and she didn't know how to reconcile that with having other girls potentially interested in you. It'snot an easy thing to deal with for anyone, especially not a teenager with severe depression.

Monika was coded to become 'self-aware' in the game; That's just how it was. The title of 'Club President' was the condition for that. She couldn't handle being sentient in a world where she had no choice given, so she tried to hammer out one herself, but her lack of understanding of the script caused her to make a mess of it all, destroying her friends and her world for the love of an entity that could not truly reciprocate. It would be like one of us un-making the universe to earn the love of a god that would probably only be disappointed we did so much harm and failed to understand anything."
