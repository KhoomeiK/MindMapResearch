But it doesn’t mean that you should just immediately stop it for his mental health because this is ultimately *your* own mental health journey. Try to find someone else to talk to, and also acknowledge with your bf that you will work towards curbing self harm but only at *your own* pace. He has to understand that there’s no point for you to suppress the want to self harm just because it makes other people uncomfortable. Your progress should be about yourself and for yourself! :)"

But if he’s being like this because he doesn’t want to deal with something unfamiliar or dark, then I think you’re better on your own anyway"
