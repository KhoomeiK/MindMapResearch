Things like nuts seemed to be really well stocked when I went a week ago (only item I wanted that was sold out was orange chicken), so you probably don’t need to worry about them being gone late in the day."
sandiego,fmdc6p3,t3_fukxry,1585964199.0,No. Only essential business employees are required to have them and will get in trouble otherwise. You should still wear one though.
sandiego,fmcskw9,t1_fmc9k8e,1585951997.0,"Unless you work in a medical field, it’s just cloth masks of any sort that are required for all other essential workers (supermarket clerks, warehouse workers, Hobby Lobby employees, etc.). You can’t really expect people to be able to find ones that *aren’t* homemade at this point. And I believe that your place of work is required to provide masks of some sort. It’s why they’ve told the public to report any businesses who aren’t following the order."
sandiego,fmbw9b3,t1_fmbt6f5,1585934378.0,"They're recommending we use cloth masks, as N95 masks should be designated for medical professionals. Lots of people are making them, but if you don't have access to a sewing machine or know of any people who are making them, then they've said a scarf is just as good. If you don't have a scarf--use an old tee shirt or something of that nature. It's basically come to ""Anything is better than nothing.""

That said, I have seen some folks on this sub who are making masks. I'd search the term and then PM anyone who's making them and politely ask for one, offer to reimburse them (if you can). Etsy could also be another avenue if you want something fun and can wait. Stay safe."

Precautions aren’t even a cure. And the reason it’s currently getting tossed around is because the president also bastardized it. And he’s basically walked it back by pretending that when he said we’d end these protocols by Easter, that he didn’t actually mean that and he wants us to continue these protocols through the end of April. Even he’s starting to get it (or at least his handlers are).

There are stark differences here. Morgues in New York are placing bodies in hallways because they’re overwhelmed. Hospitals are overwhelmed. The death toll is rising exponentially. If you don’t see how these are MAJOR differences, I don’t know what to say. Other than to please stay home. Please."

The numbers are quickly rising. Regardless of how well/poorly they’ve been handling this, our own president and his medical team have said that we could see 100k-200k deaths. There were about 34k flu related deaths in the 2018-2019 flu season (what you linked to was just a projection for the most recent season, and still lower than hundreds of thousands).
