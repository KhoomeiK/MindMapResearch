Psychonaut,fqy9p7l,t3_glfeuo,1589745034.0,"I'd like to share a harrowing but in the end very positive experience I had doing a 5 gram dark trip a few weeks ago; I hope that it will help you see that this is not all there is to shrooms, and that as painful and discouraging as this may feel right now it can help you in the end. 

I did 5 grams of penis envy (a strong strain.) It was one of the most powerful and incredible experiences of my life and also the most exhausting. The majority of the trip ended up being therapeutic in nature; and the most intensely so I've ever had a trip be. I've experienced a fair amount of abuse and traumatic situations in my life, I definitely struggle with chronic depression and PTSD symptoms, and wanted to process and let go of some of these memories. And boy did the shrooms take me there.

As a disclaimer this did also happen after experiencing MDMA psychotherapy twice, which finally really jumpstarted some recovery for me, after so many years. Also a couple of other smaller dose, positive shroom trips. So I had already made a big jump in my journey of recovery. 

Anyway, I came up I realized I wanted to not only be in complete darkness, but under a blanket too. I had the sense that I needed to go deep within myself; I had the imagery of the darkness and silence of being in the womb - of needing rebirth. As I curled up under a blanket everything shattered. Myself, my mind, my awareness, everything. I was in a huge mindscape of shards of glass and ambient golden light, with the shards surrounding me as far as they eye could see and forming a sort of floor underneath me. Each shard was a memory, and my own consciousness was like a giant magnifying lens; focusing on each shard at a time. As I went into each one - and this was happening rapidly one after the other without giving me a moment to rest - I would be enveloped completely in that memory. I would remember it in such detail and intensity down to the exact clothes I was wearing, details in the surroundings, my exact mindset and emotions and how I was at that moment in my life. The physical sensations, everything. I was also finding repressed memories among these, and even things that weren't necessarily repressed but that I hadn't remembered and thought about in so long that they might as well have been. 

This was all extraordinarily intense. Visceral. I was shaking and panting, just overwhelmed with it all. This was the most physically exhausting thing I've ever experienced, beyond workouts and hikes and such even though I was just laying in a bed - it was just so all encompassing; on every level of my being. It was painful, soul rending; seeing all these things.
With each memory it was as though I was being brought through it in a way that I could experience it again but to release it, process it, let it go; however. I was brought the full horror of each traumatic memory and time in my life, for many of them more than I had remembered until now - my mind had repressed so much. But it was as though as I was an observer at the same time as I was experiencing it all again.

This lasted all throughout the peak. As it began to let up I would still find a memory from time to time but it wasn't as intense. I managed to lay on my back and just watch the ceiling with my eyes open - and now I was able to pay attention to the visuals for the first time, as I slowly calmed down.

And the visuals were fucking incredible. In this dark room only very dimly lit by the window; creating faint shadows - the ceiling and walls became a very different room; a gigantic cavern of fractals and geometric architecture, the ceiling extending far far into the distance beyond where the eye could see; just a series of arches going ever further upward. It all shifted slowly, through colors, sacred geometry, etc. It slowly wore down over a couple hours. When I got up to get water, my physical vision was still behaving like that magnifying lens but with actual real world stuff, creating hyper detail and focus on what I was directly looking at but almost fuzzy with everything else. 

A couple weeks later I am still finding memories when an association touches them. I also feel more clearheaded about what my lived experiences have resulted in and how they have changed me, and what I can do going forward to better my own life. It has been a struggle with the new things revealed from the memories I had repressed - but I would rather know them to understand myself and my mental mechanisms better now; and to better have the option of making peace.

It was so so worth it in the dark; this experience couldn't have happened otherwise. Even for just the visuals alone; I've never seen anything that incredible visually. 


I would highly recommend in another week when your tolerance is back to baseline (ideal is two weeks) to do another lower dose - maybe 3 grams, no higher. Do it in with light, in a positive, comfortable place where you feel safe and associate with good things. The beauty of nature and sunlight is a good option, if you have somewhere like that where you won't be bothered by strangers. Think on what was so unpleasant about this trip, specifically with the intent of understanding it and seeing what you can learn from it. 

Even if you are afraid, which I understand - it would be much worse to simply leave a trip like this one and the depression you have been in after it, alone; without having a positive and healing experience to set your mind back on track. It will happen, I believe in you.

Sometimes these tough experiences are necessary - healing can be very painful and at times feel like it isn't healing at all. It is a process. It takes more than one trip, to change mental things like this; and the tough trips will be worth it especially after doing other trips that will help you integrate and heal these terrible things. The shrooms are medicine and will always bring you healing and progress in the end; if you use them more than once, knowledgeably and safely; as well as putting in effort towards self improvement and integrating their messages in your daily life - even if it seems like it is slow and isn't much, even if it feels like a mountain to get over.

You can do this. Believe in yourself."

druidism,fqum8xw,t3_gkzavm,1589661160.0,"""Celtic lore and spell craft of the dark goddess, invoking The Morrigan"" by Stephanie Woodfield. It is a very comprehensive book, information and education about her, the history, mythology, what she is like and is all about, etc. Her many aspects and differing qualities. 

It also has steps to working with her, mainly meditations and spells; you can hold off on those parts if you feel it is not time yet. Although if you want to know for sure if she is calling to you or not; taking those guided meditations as they are or tailoring one of your own can help you to tentatively try and feel that out.

Also the spells can be somewhat complex and full of many ingredients that may be somewhat unrealistic to come by; if you're new to spellcraft or in depth spells aren't your thing that is alright; it's not essential.

 I also do not completely agree with all of the authors interpretations/opinions but there is little of that, it doesn't override everything else.

Overall I would definitely recommend the book to anyone wanting to learn about The Morrigan, whether new to this sort of thing or further down the path. It is a very important and helpful one for me personally. Take it at your own pace"

I am childfree for moral and practical reasons (world overpopulation, widespread poverty); as well as simply preferring to live as free of a life for myself as I can - I don't ever want to be held down by having child to look after. I would also want my relationship with my partner to be for ourselves only. I don't care about it sounding selfish, because my life is my right to do what I want with - and wouldn't it be cruel to the child I raised if I had one when I didn't want to? I wouldn't ever be able to fully hide my resentment and sadness no matter how much I tried; even if I grew to love the kid very much it wouldn't change how much they would change my life.

I was transitioning for such bad reasons, reasons I see many of these other woman doing it for - severe sexual trauma, societal gender roles that I'd been conforming to that made me absolutely miserable - one of the things that kept me stuck identifying as trans for so long was just how much more I love traditionally male clothes. Guys jeans, no heels, no makeup, sports bras under dapper shirts and button ups, cute jackets, no more shaving my legs. It's a million times more comfortable physically and mentally, I'm not constantly aware of being ogled and objectified like I was in feminine womans clothes; and they're just so much more practical too.

I got my head on straight after going through a bunch of trauma healing; it wouldn't have happened without that. And now that I've accepted I can wear those clothes and just be a butch tomboy of a woman I feel so free. And also feel so awful for all these woman who are where I was...it's tragic, and it also makes me grieve how less like I am to find a butch woman who doesn't identify as trans to date (I am lesbian, and like other butch or tomboy women.)"

And in the last couple of weeks, I've begun smoking a 1:1 THC CBD strain alongside a standard, high THC strain - and it works. I can get really high again, and I am just fine. It's still not quite the same as when I got baked in my late teens, but I can get the beneficial and recreational effects of weed again and I am so happy to have it back.

It never really feels like the real thing though; just like a watered down trace of it leftover in my neural pathways that gets triggered by the association."

I know it doesn't make their homophobia and rejection okay. I don't know what to say other than this is absolutely awful of them both as parents and as people, and I am so sorry for you and your bro. But you two don't got to let them direct your lives."

Given that, yeah; I absolutely would take the job in a heart beat. With 40k a year I'd quit my current job, and spend the time in between the trips integrating and growing myself as a person, working with the psychedelics and learning more and more about the capabilities of what I can do, and bring back into life; with the incredible tool that is tripping. I'd also enjoy the added aspect of reporting this to a professional board/organization; that I'm assuming would be the ones hiring me - I'm guessing they would have particular questions and instructions for me to pursue and experiment with. That would make it even more interesting. 

So it would basically be the path I am already on with psychedelics, but with much more freedom and time to devote to it. I'd be very happy."

LeftHandPath,fgo4lh9,t3_ezcgv6,1580959647.0,"Absolutely. Here is one thing that I would do.

This is somewhat more of cursing than hexing, and the components of it may not be everyone's cup of tea (which is okay.) But it works for me, and I have used this type of magic towards a couple of men who violated me.

So, first step is making a ""poppet"" as they're sometimes called - simply a physical representation of the man himself. Some folk go so far as to sew a whole doll. But literally cutting out two pieces of paper shaped like a human, and putting them together with scotch tape, with maybe cotton or grass stuffed in the middle; will do the trick as well. 

Get into your ritual/spell space. A headspace of personal power, of feeling your rightful anger towards him; is ideal. Call the circle if that is what you do, light red and black candles to materialize your intent into the universe as the flames burn. Bare a dagger or sword on your alter. Whatever it is that works for you in your practice.

The idea is essentially to torture him, or inflict other more abstract things upon him; through the poppet. Tailor it to your particular situation, to whatever it is you want to do to him - for example, if you wanted to curse him with sexual dysfunction to the point he can't get pleasure at all? Or to catch a painful/incurable STD? Draw genitalia on the poppet and then cross it off with red pen. Stab the drawn genitals with a needle. Go wild. Whatever works for you, do it - and while you do it, intensely visualize as well as speak the words aloud, of specifically what you want him to suffer. Don't hold back on your emotions, or the strength and harshness of your words; they are good, and they fuel and power your intent. 

You can expand the idea out from there. Curse him with declining health to the point that it ruins his life? - You could damage the poppet respectively, and visualize and narrate aloud how you will things to go for him. Want him to never be loved by another soul again? You could bind a black string soaked in a repulsive fluid, like urine or dishwater rot; securely around the chest of the doll, and speak how it is a barrier that no one will ever wish to cross, that no one will ever see what is underneath it in a positive light.

Representations and symbology are the name of the game here, and there is no wrong answer for whatever comparison you want to draw to place your will. 

You can also simply channel all of your rage and agony into the doll, willing him to feel all that he has made you feel. 

I hope this method helps. I am deeply sorry this happened to you; the injustice of it is beyond words. But, know you do have the power to strike back. Believe in your own ability."

1. This is emotionally abusive of them to do to him, he has the right to fight them on it. 


2. Moving furniture is not manipulating his parents back. What in the world are you on?


3. IF they physically stop him, he fights, and they have to physically hurt him to subdue him/make him obey them - then yes, he would absolutely have the right to call CPS or the cops. Cops might not do much, legally. CPS is the better option - CPS can see physical marks on him, hear him describe what they're doing that is ruining his life and harming him mentally, and at the least it will give his parents a good scare and importantly, a reality check - which because they are being abusive, they absolutely deserve to have. 


4. On a philosophical and moral level, when parents are being emotionally and mentally abusive, a theoretical situation where you manipulate them in return would be nothing more than fighting for your own survival/sanity, fighting to not he abused by them anymore. If you live and breathe you have the right to stick up for yourself.

We should have laws that restrict idiots from accidentally harming again; instead of treating them the same as malevolent crime doers. Take away a drivers license if they run someone over an accident. Court rule that someone may not purchase a pet or keep a child if they catch a dog in an elevator or leave a child in a hot car. 

Maybe lift that ban if they go through mandated classes on how to not be an idiot.
