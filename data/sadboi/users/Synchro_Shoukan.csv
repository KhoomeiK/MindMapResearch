self,fpcknbc,t3_gcoomw,1588504105.0,"I'll put it to you like this: Don't believe the things you think. 

You have a mental illness, so why would you believe everything you think? That seems crazy. 

You may think your parents act like that and they might even.but have you tried not using a different language than what you normally speak?

Use your native tongue, you aren't less cool or anything for doing it. Inside of lamenting how you can't find people to connect with, get out of your comfort zone (all this hate) and try just being there for someone else. Instead of waiting for them to be there for you.

It will make you feel better and you'll get along with more people. Try not to always think of negatives and look at their positives.

I'm sorry you are going through this, man. But in my own experience with mental health, a lot of what I thought was me assuming and I was wrong about it all. I guarantee if you tell your parents what you're feeling, they'd be there for you.

Good luck, take it one day at a time."
