ETA I saw the answer in another comment: it was the first Dakota Frost book. Couldn't exactly recommend it, but I like the idea and think more people should write about stuff like this!"
BipolarReddit,fja748q,t3_fc7s5m,1583167741.0,"I've started telling them up front that I'm bipolar and that sometimes I'll be a great friend, and then sometimes I'll just be absent, but that my love for them won't change. Most of my friends (even the newer ones) have been really cool about it. I've had some friends that I made recently who actually texted me when they hadn't heard from me for a while, saying ""no reply needed, but I wanted you to know you matter to me and I care about you"" which has been really helpful in a depressive period I'm going through.

I still feel so guilty though, like I'm their bummer, shitty friend they have to worry about rather than their fun, cool friend they can rely on."

FTMOver30,fa2b8zb,t3_e7hnen,1575780010.0,"My experience has been amazing, fwiw. I had a hysterectomy with Dr. Eve Zaritsky in the East Bay, top surgery with Dr. Winnie Tong in SF, and I am starting T in about a week, all in the span of about a year and a half.

In terms of hoops, I have to have a gender therapy appointment that lasts about two hours on prefer to get the referral for whatever big step I want to take (surgery or HRT), so I've had to go three times now. It has never been uncomfortable for me and my therapist was very accommodating and informed.

Any time I've gotten anxious or felt like things were taking too long, I contacted the Transitions clinic and let them know, and they worked to get by me in sooner (if someone cancelled, etc).

I also made use of their name and gender change class where they help you fill out all your paperwork, and was really happy with that too. I've been to a couple of the support groups for trans people too, and those are optional (not required for your referrals for surgery, etc)

I've been very happy with the care I've received, and my top surgery results are amazing (I did the no-nipple surgery, full disclosure).

Just want to share because I was surprised at how great they have been. Hope this helps! Feel free to pm me if you have more questions!"
