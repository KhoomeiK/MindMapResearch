I have barely been able to slow down long enough with life stuff to enjoy free time and explore more of your original reply. I'm sorry to hear about your guy and hope that you live your best life in spite of him. If you love him then let him be free, yes, but never at the expense of your own wellbeing. I applaud anybody that maintains a long distance relationship regardless of circumstances. It can be so emotionally exhausting so let's both work on that self-love we talked about because we deserve it :)"
bipolar,fqdg0nv,t1_fqdea3j,1589288847.0,"I could write a NOVEL on zen/meditation/spirituality/philosophy!!! My original post was written because I'm currently going through the beginning stages of a divorce and I want to live in the emotions that I'm feeling. So it was basically a fantasy feeling of the romance between belle and the beast that I wanted to feel more of since I was deprived of that pure love for years. Beast frees Belle because he knows that if she comes back to him, it's her choice. That sacrifice is so innocent and pure and magical. It's something I never felt with my husband. 
With that being said, I'm so glad you bring up self- love because it clearly goes into my healing process, and I know that part of my journey (loving myself) has only just begun. I'm excited to have the chants you introduced to me a part of my arsenal to help me along the way! Can't wait to hear your other suggestions :)"

bipolar,fqdcd15,t1_fqct4z0,1589286354.0,"It wasn't even a decision per se...after spending the last 6 months just doing things that make me happy and working on my own self rather than worrying about ""us"", I realized that it is possible to choose to be happy. I lovingly removed myself from the marriage. It's supposed to help motivate your partner too, but that wasn't the case for my husband. So in a quest to gather information after tossing around the idea of divorce for the last year, I called a lawyer just to see what it's all about. Instead of feeling sick to my stomach during our zoom meeting, the lawyer's little speech made me excited. I finally admitted to myself that my husband was emotionally abusive, and now here we are. That was literally only three weeks ago. It's been an emotional rollercoaster, but not a bipolar rollercoaster. I can literally feel myself evolve and I'm grateful that my obsession with collecting facts led me to call the lawyer. She made divorce real, attainable, and lifted the curtains from my eyes. I hope this helps. You don't deserve his abuse, and he needs help. Personality disorders like he probably has are not treatable the same way our stuff is. You can have a special bond and friendship and be divorced...it's just about letting go of expectations from each other. 
Lots of love I hope this helps"

Don't let it go. Go to therapy together if you want to stay married. Don't let the marriage counselor talk to you two separately (it's unprofessional).

I'm getting a punch to my gut reading the things that he has said to you because I have been in the exact same position almost word for word. 

I'm sorry you're going through this, I'm sending you lots of positive thoughts"
bipolar,fqcnwi5,t3_ghyj69,1589263392.0,"Totally relate. You've made a key observation though. You say that when this happens, you know you're worse than just simple sad or simple pissed. Being mindful of that is going to save you a lot of extra pain even if it does suck to see the disturbing images. Maybe use the powerful darkness and write a short story. Take the images and create something else with them, even if it's just a playlist that corresponds with the grotesque flashes you see. 

Obviously if you even felt like ACTING on these thoughts, that's a different story. But I think you know that. Keep up the mindfulness and introspection. I don't get alarmed anymore when my images pop up, but I'm still working on ""fixing"" them, and also deciding if they can be fixed or if I just need reframing."
bipolar,fqcnbl8,t3_gi2gsq,1589262908.0,"I can't make words right now because of my shit. But YES OMG. This sounds like me when my mania was easy to understand. I say the word easy as a relative term. I should say recognizable instead. But yeah man. You literally sound like you've taken thoughts out of my own head. 

I've questioned my illness for seven years now. I've only accepted the facts that I will never grasp all the details and will make myself go crazy with TOO much analyzation...which seems like the best outcome honestly (acceptance that we can understand our bipolar and also know nothing about it).

Fill up your toolbox for when you have an episode like this again! Make sure you don't drive a car. Who cares if you dance like an idiot at home? Find the tools to shape your mania into something that's not harmful, and possibly constructive. 

Good luck! Lots of love!"

I can Google objective advice articles about the logistics of it all, but I was hoping to hear your opinions about what challenges and considerations an American family would have to make before living in Scotland permanently. Specifically: political, cultural acclimation, schooling and financial challenges. Also, what kind of stereotypes to expect. Positive aspects would be appreciated also :) At the moment this is all just fantasy land inside my head, but I have been known to take giant leaps of faith/risk/adventure before.

Psychic,fczjhf1,t1_fcwqonc,1578102591.0,"So I believe that science and spirituality are the same since everything is connected beyond our comprehension. With that being said, this paralyzing fear personally sounds like the evolutionary biological component within all of us that warn us to stay away from creepy crawlies. Or perhaps take a page from psychology and really dig deep to try and find out why you can tolerate other spiders but not daddy long legs. Are DLL spiders the biggest kind of spider found inside your home? If so, maybe this is then just a trigger for you about how you feel about intruders infiltrating your sense of security (for example). I've found that sometimes analyzing things to death, really deeply and intently, can take the edge off some of my fears. I hope this helps and I hope you feel better! Fear is the worst feeling."

In my writing, I felt that he is now softer, but in a way that embodies strength and wisdom. With your further information, I can say that he certainly found a sense of peace in death and just seriously overwhelmingly loves you. Trust that he is always there!

Psychic,fcthy8a,t1_fctgvl9,1577943884.0,"So when I do automatic writing, I start with something that looks like this in a Word document:

""Dodging hilltops in summer like doging flies in the summertime. The fishing line tangle but there is only amusement and a man with dark hari tall and ppeppered life is meaniless without those dashing smiles are charms and alibis they only wish they could lie about a life like this. .he brookes water is cold but beautiful theres nothing I wish more than for this man here with me being carefree with nothing but the breeze the heather and the trees.""

If I'm doing and automatic reading for myself, I would then proceed to correct spelling and grammar mistakes. However, I was able to glean the answer of the question at hand and will give you my interpretation. Think of the automatic writing as a way for me to flow with the energies as I continue to practice until I do not need a medium at all. Also, I write until it feels ""natural"" to stop. Sometimes it could be pages and pages of information. Mostly, it looks like your paragraph that is written above. 

With all that being said, I was shown a tall man with a fishing vest on and a red flannel shirt. He has a little bit of peppered white hair beginning to show on a dark crew cut, but can't be more than 45 years old. He is fly fishing in a brooke that is at the base of a small mountain. The brooke is cold but not harsh. He is smiling at you, not showing teeth, in a way that is laid back, relaxed, and peacefully content with your surroundings. He is the embodiment of a good life, getting away from it all, and like all of our guides, he is the embodiment of pure love for you. Call on this fisherman/camping/cabin guy when you are overwhelmed and stressed out. He will help you find the beauty of your surroundings even if they are not as serene as the mountainside I've depicted. This may even be someone you know that has died. 

All in all, this is a really gorgeous picture. Thank you for the opportunity to write it for you. Please let me know what you think."

Psychic,fctfw79,t3_eisdmf,1577941958.0,"I wouldn't read too much into to be honest. The shop owner could have had nervous energy for numerous reasons that had nothing to do with you, but were accentuated/noticed by you since you are becoming more mindful and meditative. Even if there was something ""dark"" that the owner saw during your reading, anything can be counteracted by the light. Make sure to take precautions against negative energies so they don't consume you; I bet you will be picking up on a lot more energy the more mediation you do. Like you mentioned, these energies may not necessarily be negative, but too much of anything will cause burn out. Obsidian is good for absorbing negativity. Picturing bright, white light (or your version of pure goodness and love), will allow you protection further protection. I hope this helps!"

Wicca,f94jus9,t3_e3fk3e,1575090737.0,"""Living Wicca"" by Scott Cuninngham has really resonated with me personally. That is unfortunately the only book I can suggest to you from personal reading experience. It is a basic breakdown of solitary Wiccan practice to include tools, altars, spells, and beliefs. Wicca has reverence for nature, specifically embodied by a god and goddess. However, the god and goddess are just representations of the higher energy that abounds us all. We are all energy  and orientation is inconsequential. Hope this helps :)"

Let me know how it goes; I'd like to hear what this ""block"" ends up manifesting as for you. If you feel a block, there is a block, regardless of its physical representation.

I fucking hated when my husband did that kind of shit when I was pregnant, and we were together for 4 years at that point. That's how some people are and it comes from a place of fear. So people will turn to sarcasm and jokes as a defense mechanism, 100%. Doesn't make it great for people on the other end though. I am a woman who has had two babies. Each time, I had about 5 medical personnel in the room with me not including my husband. Having a baby isn't private unless you're at home. You could never ever want to see this dude again in your life, but if wants to be a part of his son's life and he's sober and has a modicum of responsibility, then he should see his son be born. It's fucking gross trust me - but magical. Dads do not become dads in the spiritual sense of the word until they first see their baby. You have been a mother from the beginning of your pregnancy, and he has only ""thought"" about dad life, whereas you've felt your baby move or had symptoms to physically alert you. It would set a really good example for your son to show kindness and compassion to a father that actually wants to be there. We all know someone who was not fortunate enough to have a parent that wanted to be in their life, and your guy wants to be there. This is the most significant event in both of your lives so far, and it should be cherished by the two people that made this baby even possible. Good luck, girl. My husband sucked sucked sucked when I was pregnant, but he was excellent in the delivery room and loves our sons more than anything."

You are basically a walking interpreter and it's a beautiful thing to see synchronicity and divulge meaning from it. Try looking at it in a new perspective. Say thank you to the universe next time it happens. If it gets overwhelming, say that you appreciate this divine energy but need to rest. The universe will never get mad at you, it loves you and will immediately understand your intention. These numbers come from a place of love and I bet if you look up any reputable psychics or intuitives in your area, they will say the same."

True happiness is something that will never set of a chain reaction of self-deprecation. It is wholesome and weightless to feel happy and never comes with strings attached.

Remember all the positive traits of bipolar like imagination or creativity, and then remember that you get to show a child all of those good things firsthand. They might inherit my crap (I think my first son will), but we are in a different generation than our parents who came before us and we are not afraid of therapists and talking about mental illness like they were. It has taken me a year since my second son was born to really understand how much I am their world and how much they love me.

I was excellent during my first pregnancy. I was one of those annoying people that didn't have a single physical symptom, and I had stopped taking all of my meds three months prior to finding out I was pregnant because we were trying to get preg. This didn't even mess with me at all while I was pregnant. Then my son was born and it was magical (all the first baby beautiful cliches were all true with him). I was pretty hypomanic but most women are wonky after birth. 

Fast forward to a year later when I was done breastfeeding and wanting to get back on my meds. The meds I was on before that were my miracle concoction at the time (abilify and wellbutrin) but were making me nuts when I tried them again, like off the wall irritability and more depressive thoughts. So it was like starting all over again with the whole ""what meds work for me"" thing, which sucked. But then I got pregnant with my second baby so I was like oh ok no biggie...while I was pregnant with the second, we sold our house, lived with my father and stepmother (myself, my husband, my son, and my two dogs), looked at houses to buy for 6 months, had my second son who needed to go to the NICU for a few days, moved out of my dad's because of a huge argument, moved in with husband's aunt, and then finally moved into the new house with a 6 week old newborn, two year old, and two dogs. Needless to say, shit was ridiculously stressful and inconsistent. I developed postpartum depression which escalated to postpartum psychosis. The psychiatrist I was seeing retired while I was pregnant, so I had to start literally from the top with a new person who was awful and prescribed me abilify even though I told her what happened last time. It came crashing down with a suicide attempt 4 months later, but on the bright side, I found lithium and that shit legit saved my life.

SO. With all the fun background noise out of the way....I will say this. We are certainly prone to negative effects of hormones from a pregnancy wayyy more than other people without bipolar, true. But in the case of my second son, everything I did are precursors for women without bipolar to develop postpartum depression. That is, making crazy life decisions, having a crazy amount of stress, having crazy changes. I was literally asking the universe to hand me a whopping plate of shit. My very specific advice to you is to have a supportive partner. My husband is super fucked up lol so that was rough not to feel on the same page with wanting all the cheesy pregnant pictures and dumb (fun) baby shower games. The supportive partner I'm urging you to have will come in handy in case your psychiatrist retires because they will know to get you a new one asap and not wait around. I would also make your pregnancy as stress free and change free as possible. Have a lot of fun with it and please do all the cheesy crap you want, who cares what other people think about it. This is the time where the manic side of ourselves really comes in handy because it's a lot of fun to organize all the baby stuff and research the hell out of any baby thing you can think of. 

Wow my post is so long, I'm only sorry if you're annoyed about it lol. The best part about being a parent is finding out for yourself that all the cliches are true. Be aware of the risks that you have because you have bipolar. Be mindful if you notice any of those risks developing and be honest with your support system. Not to toot my own horn, but my kids are obsessed with me so don't worry about that part of things. I'm sure they'll hate me when they're teenagers, but I am already teaching them as much emotional intelligence as possible so hopefully that'll translate. Having bipolar is honestly such a gift as a parent because when my three year old has an apocalyptic meltdown, I realize that he's acting just like me when I'm in a mixed episode and I know exactly how that feels so I can be empathetic to his struggle. They get so many adventures out of me because I'm stable enough where my ""highs"" involve exploring bugs and sticks and using our incredible bipolar imagination, and then my ""lows"" are movie days where I just have to move if the little one year old needs a diaper change. P.s. babyproof the shit out of your house for you low days so that you can just sit on the couch and not feel stressed that they could hurt themselves. 

Omg this post is ridiculous. I never use my computer to type and now I know it's because I just can't stop typing haha. I could LITERALLY go on forever here, please feel free to message me if you have any other questions!! I'm really hopeful that this post won't scare you and instead it'll show you that there is plenty to worry about, but just be prepared for anything and always have a backup plan, and everything will be beautiful because pregnancy is so sacred and your children will be angels sent just for you."

It takes a lot of fucking strength on your end to defend your grandma's wishes even though they lead to her death. I hope my kids are like you when I'm that age. Sending good thoughts your way, good luck.

Edit,  want to add that everyone should be focusing on enjoying her last good days before she gets so far gone that she's not ""there"" anymore. Im so happy you are able to do so im sure it is a gift for her and you will feel the same one day if you don't already."

Christianity,f7alegz,t1_f798md3,1573532348.0,"I'm also familiar with this feeling. I sometimes have an issue with putting God into a box with rules and restraints about ""right"" and ""wrong"" ways to practice your faith. Religion is beautiful; the politics of religion are not. Look into everything, literally. Perhaps philosophies/religions that focus on centering yourself and connecting with energy (another word for the concept of God) resonate more with what your soul needs to thrive. For example, I am currently reading ""Living Wicca"" by Scott Cunningham. I have always been attracted to the idea of universal energies, and I have also always loved a benevolent God. This book might be a super weird suggestion for this sub, but if you're open to choosing Christian denominations, you could see what's out there too. Worshipping other gods that are not the true God is certainly frowned upon, and in same cases abhorrent in certain Christian ideologies, but I'm noticing that you mention a pull towards religion, not a pull towards Christianity per se. Do I love going to church? Totally. It is calm, meditative, and familiar as I grew up Catholic. My Spirit connects with something ""more"". Do I sometimes pray to Earth Mother and Sky Father and listen to really intense Native American Flutes in the background? Yep. I really miss and cherish being involved in an uplifting religious community (catholic church), but certain aspects do not nourish my soul. I could go on and on about different religions that I have researched and then implemented their ideals in my daily life, but what seems most important in the context of your dilemma, is that you feel alone with no community, chaotic with no rules and structure, and have a spiritual calling with no idea who's on the other line. Maybe make a list of what you *need* from religion from a purely logistical standpoint. Do you need a physical church, or can you make Nature your church? Do you need to have fellow practitioners physically by your side raising you up and lifting your spirits? Do you need serious contemplation, or levity in a world that is already really dark? Do you need rituals? Do you need to be proud and able to practice a socially acceptable religion that you can tell anybody about? This last question is something I still struggle with. I have no idea what to call myself anymore and have worried for a long time what I would look like to other people if I were to actively practice a mashup of religions. I have wandered for a long time in this zone of ""who am I, Spiritually?"". I have only just recently started to reconnect with my inner self in regards to faith, and while I'm still sad that I'm alone in this current phase of my journey, I have faith in God/the Universe (they are interchangeable words to me now) and have finally realized that it's not possible to be alone when you are connected with Him. 

&#x200B;

I honestly hope this helps you in some way. I am definitely a little insecure about posting non-Christian elements in a Christian sub, but felt like it could really benefit you to hear an ""out there"" perspective. I wish I would have had this response I'm giving you given to me a few years ago when I was going through a similar struggle. I am sending a lot of positive thoughts your way!

Common courtesy is difficult for people that process social cues and information differently than what's typical.
