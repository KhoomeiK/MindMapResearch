BipolarReddit,fp09q1y,t3_gakv99,1588205126.0,"Hey I have BP1 and GAD/panic disorder (my psych just terms it “anxiety”) if that’s all right. First of all, you are not alone! There are many of us out here. 

Second of all, I’m not going to full on recommend any specific medications because they affect different people differently.  I am on a combo of a mood stabilizer, antipsychotic, anti depressant, and beta blocker for my mood and anxiety issues. I would follow up with your prescriber to find the right combo of meds for you. 

Third of all, I’ve found that meditation is a great coping mechanism. I do this YouTube meditation a few times a week to keep myself even: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=u4gZgnCy5ew&t=1479s"
