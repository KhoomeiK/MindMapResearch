I think the somber aspect is a combination of the conditions (very dense growth & damp from the rain) & it’s reputation. We both believe in the paranormal but also skeptical/ logical. We read the basics but tried not to read any personal blogs so our experience wouldn’t be tainted. 

The unease increased for us as we were trying to get back. we heard a loud crash & looked over just in time to see a huge (like at least 50ft long) tree limb coming crashing down. It was probably 100-150ft to our left. That was pretty “wtf!” No other branches or limbs had fallen that we were aware of while there. It was just too close for comfort. Shortly after that, is when we had trouble finding our markers.  

We did come across a few areas where some one had sat & hopefully, just thought for awhile. That was a gut punch. Like ooooohhh damn 😐🥺. We really didn’t think we were going to find anything. 

Is it haunted? I wouldn’t be surprised. If there’s a place that would truly be haunted (& not just due to fearful imagination) this would definitely be in the top 5 for me. I currently live in Okinawa Japan. I love the local history & folklore. I love hiking & exploring the old shrines. There’s been a few times it feels like I’m being watched or can sense something not of the normal critter variety, closing in. Or just simply get the “Don’t do it, Don’t go there” vibe. 

I believe there’s a reason so many cultures have ghost, woodland spirits, gods, boogeyman, etc. stories. A lot are able to be rationalized away with science & logic. But there’s some that can’t be. I don’t think these things simply vanished; they just live where most humans don’t go."

We did a day hike (in another part of the forest) & it was just....off like you said. There were a few times when it was just dead silence, like everything sounded 100yards away & 5ft ahead the normal forest sounds started again. It was unsettling.  We purposely strayed off the trail out of morbid curiosity. We used hot pink ribbons to mark our path & tried to maintain a fairly straight path. On our way back, we lost our trail. One of us would stay at the last marker, while the other went ahead to find the next one (so there was a point of reference & we didn’t have to backtrack). Only after it was found would we take it down & meet up. For about 20mins my friend wandered around looking for the next ribbon. Some odd things occurred during that time. 

We tried to test our nerves & hike at night. We got maybe 7mins in with flashlights & could just feel the oppression of the darkness. We could no longer see or hear the road, like it had disappeared altogether. At the same time we spoke up & called the night hike over. There was just ‘something’ in the air & we wanted to get out ASAP. Neither of us are easily scared. I would go back in the day, but a night hike is off the table."

We did the whole talk about Jesus, letting go our sins, etc. watched the Passion of the Christ (just the scene where they torture & kill Jesus), & then made all of us close our eyes & pray for forgiveness. They positioned ppl around the doors & told us not to open our eyes. They said we’d hear ppl talking in tongues & so on. The more they ‘prepared’ us, the more suspect it got. It was weird. Like “what the fuck is going on?!” craziness. Other ppl started wailing & screaming gibberish. It probably lasted 30 mins or so & then they said “ok” & just like that the hysteria died down.

In my experience, I’m not convinced there was the “Holy Spirit” or “demons.” I think they just gathered a lot of women who had daily sadness & were, well gullible (myself included), & swayed our emotional responses. 
Idk, it just seems convenient the “demons” prevented him & the preacher was near by.

Nah I grew up with that & do not want to live with that again. 

Like lately I’ve been internally spiraling: my friends moved, but we still have a group chat on messenger that we use. I FINALLY got a surgery that I’ve been trying to get for a few years that will hopefully resolve a lot of female issues (this was not an elective surgery). They all knew the date of the surgery. I talked to them the morning of on my way there. 

It’s been 2 weeks & not one of them has asked how it went or how I’m doing. I’ve been silent on messenger as well. I haven’t talked about it on FB, so there’s literally no updates from me. I’m hurt & angry, but mostly hurt. Thought we were a pretty tight group but no one seems to notice I’ve fallen off the grid. Yeah every one is busy & has their own things going on but 2 weeks?! Ppl I hardly know (in comparison to them) that I mentioned the surgery in passing to have checked on me! 
I’m so hurt, I’ve chosen not to talk in the chat so I don’t say something childish. 
From there- my stupid brain has thought of every slight, every time I got left out, every half hearted appreciation speech, etc & just keeps dragging it up. I’ve talked to my hubs about the issue with my friends, but not the dwelling part. That, that part is something deeper & I know that needs to be worked on in therapy.

I get what y’all are saying, I do. But it’s also about knowing what’s fair to put on our support systems & admitting to ourselves when we have a deeper issue. More than that- it’s about taking responsibility & addressing those issues instead of letting them fester. Like if you have a hole in the crotch of your jeans you know it needs to be repaired. If you ignore it or only complain about it, it’s just going to get worse over time. Some times patching it works. Other times you have to admit it’s time to replace them.

I went to a cultural festival recently in Japan- not a major one, but a small community one that’s known by a pretty small portion of non-locals. There was boat racing on the bay & at the end, they bring a priestess to shore. In the back ground are low mountains. Absolutely fantastic experience & almost like watching something from 60yrs ago...except right in the middle of the scene was a damn drone flying low. It was distracting & took away from the experience as well as ruined many a good pic. :\  A lot of ppl were upset. It wasn’t someone taking pics on behalf of the community either. Just someone being overzealous & inconsiderate."

The first limited (non- chocolate) flavor was Strawberry released in 2000. Limited release flavors became really popular around 2010. 

To date- according to Nestle Japan, they have  “released over 350 varieties of KitKats & regional flavors” (this is kind of confusing as it does not mean 350 different flavors. Some of the “varieties” are different forms of KitKats like KitKat sticks or mini big bites, in addition to the regular 2 finger bars).

I’ve had a hard time finding a complete list of all the flavors (even the Nestle Japan website doesn’t do it -_-) so...just from what I know of, I’d guess the actual # of flavors is closer to 250-275."

Aside from reinforcing the importance of consent, it also pointed out other behaviors like bullying & sexism. The overall message was “Men can be better” (than the current state). IMO it was a step in the right direction. It pointed out how society fails it’s self by trying to justify toxic behaviors as an acceptable cliche “boys will be boys.” 
In some ways we’ve (Americans) have gotten a little too PC & are overly sensitive in what is right & wrong. However it is changing for the better. Hell- 20 yrs ago it was a big deal when Cheerios had a mixed race family in their commercials, now it’s nothing (as it always should have been!) . 
Mental health is getting more focus but for the wrong reasons. Not every asshole is an undiagnosed sufferer. Some people are just assholes who don’t deserve to be a part of society. 
Hopefully things improve in the mental health front sooner than later. Men do suffer quite a bit, but there’s still a heavy stigma about getting help that needs to be broken."

We’re really gonna blame extra swollen blood vessels & blood filled cysts on feelings?! Never mind being consistently medically ignored for said issues has exacerbated depression. GTFOH! Grrrr. 

I don’t doubt emotional/ mental pain causes physical issues. But to imply it’s the root cause of most physical ailments is a cop out. It seems like it’s this day & ages Freudian views. It’s “the” thing to write everything off as mental & prescribe a pill & recommend therapy. Why don’t we look at WHY so many ppl have mental health issues & change our society?

If you can, push to get an MRI before a laparoscopy. That is what really changed the game for me & got the docs to take me seriously.  I’m sorry to hear you’re struggling. I wish I had pushed harder a few years ago."
