malaysia,evjpj25,t3_ck1t85,1564567255.0,The real bait for boba milk tea is the gluttony handmade boba ball itself. Nothing was overpriced for roll balls made out from tropioca flour which is cheap

confidence,erffbuz,t3_c1pzrk,1560807016.0,"Be a meme hoarder so you can be funny and do some workout. Watch movies that have cunning wit or quick-witted and sarcasm. Watch news so you can talk about current issues. Catch up what's trendy on the internet. People tend to get ignored on Twitter btw, you're not alone tho. Finally, do not engage or too attached with someone. Play hard to get. Do your hygiene right.

You don't have to be kind to gain friends all you have to do is work on your communication skills. Find out what the person is passionate about. Find friends that have same hobbies as you."

depression,eqjsy1w,t3_byo9kp,1560110725.0,"People will be influenced by the media that defines fake beauty or ideal ass. I've been there and what all I can say is, you gotta love your body more than anyone else."
AskReddit,eqat959,t3_bxtqdb,1559939476.0,I should have mastered my English grammar without grammatical error because I'll be a future English teacher in next 5 years. I could never write it correctly and lacked confidence in doing so.

depression,epvmyk1,t3_bw23tp,1559540481.0,Mostly it will be about existential crisis. Some part of me just shut off from laughing and thinking about how human cope with humor as a mechanism to stay alive.
depression,eptdg4f,t3_bvup45,1559487831.0,Depression sucks. I can't even write why I'm sad or interact with people online. Weak communication skills and low self-esteem
depression,epqwpi8,t3_bvebca,1559413817.0,"You gotta get used to it. Loneliness will slowly fade and it will become solitude. Think about it, nothing feels great when you actually reflect with your inner self. More space, more wisdom."
