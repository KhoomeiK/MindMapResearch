Those two together made me realize why I couldn’t forward with my crush back in 2012. I would feel it, try to make moves, and yet in an instant it’s like I wasn’t trying to do anything. I would be pissed about it because it’s something I want to do, but this held me back. At the time I didn’t know why.

Thankfully this is with someone I went to school with that we got reacquainted at some point. Till this day we’re great friends though.

After learning all of that, I haven’t had the chance to try again with someone new yet so I can’t say if I can fight what’s holding me back. With digital I feel it’s easy, but in person it’s where the real challenge begins. All I know now it’s difficult for me to even try to talk to someone I find attractive.

Been single since then and after fixing myself up I'm seeking hard for that even though I'm currently not searching for a relationship. I've gone through multiple dating apps and algorithms in these dating apps loves to play with people. It may work for some while for others no matter how attractive one person can be the app decides otherwise. I'm sick and tired of dating apps. In person it doesn't help I'm an introvert so thats another thing.

The last time I did have such feelings was back in 2012. It was for another person. Introversion, anxiety, and ADHD all came out to play so I was not able to move forward with her. Mind you I didn't know I had all that until I learned about it.

What's more important is my life and the road I need to get to. 2015 is where I discovered my anxiety (despite numerous signs saying I do in the past). One thing I don't want to do is to project my problems to my significant other and rely on her to help me get through this.

2018 is where I pushed myself to get help with my anxiety. Thought I can manage on my own, but learned I couldn't.

I fell hard for a crush I had between 2012 - 2017, but after learning all about this I'm glad my anxiety and ADHD got in the way of progressing things with her. Till this day we're great friends.

We all want to be with someone, but what's wrong with being with yourself? Take yourself on a date, cook for yourself, make yourself laugh. **Make yourself happy!** If you're not happy with yourself why are you going out with other people?

&#x200B;

Anxiety and ADHD, it made me feel unhappy for the most part and I didn't understand why. Now that I know more about it with myself and learn how I can work around with it, I'm more confident with myself and truth be told I love myself even more.

Do I want a date tomorrow? Not during this pandemic. I hate online dating and I would rather wait for all of this to die down and get to know them in person.

He connected it straight into the receiver and it fixed everything.

Disabling HDCP is a solution, but I wish more devices have this option. I even complained to Samsung via Twitter and the guy thought disabling HDCP is the solution. I was trying to tell him (and two other staffs) that this is a temporary fix and not every device has that ability to disable it and was curious if these TVs will get HDCP 2.3.

I looked up the internet and they say to literally treat it like a real hangover. Take yourself out for a walk, drink water, etc. Obviously don’t drink after having a panic attack. I don’t want to know how that feels like. 

As for after anxiety attacks I try not to overdo any activities and don’t over excite myself. If I can I would nap."

HomePod,fjgk5w1,t1_fjgjt1f,1583328907.0,Its a pain lol. I’ve lost count in how many times I had to do that. Whether it’s for that problem not being able to access the settings or when it’s lazy and say all devices are not responding even though they work through any other devices.
HomePod,fjgjj2m,t1_fjgiqm7,1583328410.0,"Resetting it from scratch would do the trick. The easiest method is to remove the HomePod as an accessory and it’ll pick up to wipe clean for the next person.

The other way to reset is to unplug it, give it five seconds, plug it back it, put your finger on the center where Siri’s lights are and hold it there until it beeps. Once that happens make sure to remove HomePod as an accessory before you do the first time setup.

From there you should be able to access the settings."

Anxiety,fj5r1hz,t3_fbp1s0,1583040275.0,"I suffer from this. What I’ve learned is emotions tie in to overthinking. What I do to snap out of it is to talk to myself and state the obvious. Sometimes focusing on a video game helps out too.

Another thing my therapist has taught me is to write out the current situation and then right out what you’re currently thinking. Then have an area where you’ll write out the obvious outcome. Once the moment passes look back at what you’ve written and acknowledge your train of thought process. This is to help your mind to overthink less worst possible scenarios. 

Usually this helps me to keep an open mind with things and to slowly get anxiety out of the way with any scenario. Yeah, there will be times where you’ll give in, but don’t think you’re going backwards. As we make ourselves stronger, we have to slip here and there in order to get further ahead."

ibs,fj2kpzo,t3_d8nflu,1582946192.0,"I’ve learned as you grow older you’ll be drinking less stronger stuff. And less drinking in general.

Before I was able to hang out with one of my friends and drink wine, beer, and occasionally Espolon. One night I learned I shouldn’t be drinking Espolon. I was throwing up from it. Since then I stopped doing shots.

Later on I started to learn my limits in drinking. Mind you, I’m not a heavy drinker. Before I could drink maybe three beer bottles or four. Now I’m limiting myself to one. Sometimes two if I know I had a good meal beforehand. Wine, I’m a white wine person and Chardonnay works well for me. Any other type of wine it’ll give me heartburn and gasses sometimes. I try to drink just one glass of wine. If I know I feel good and again had a good meal beforehand, I’d drink two.

It sucks. Whenever I feel like this, even if it’s just one drink, whenever I start feeling gassy or heartburn I feel like crap. It makes me want to stop alcohol together, which I personally don’t mind because I don’t drink that much in general. It’s rare to hear me say I’ll be going to this bar or buying a six pack. 

It is what it is and I’m perfectly fine with that. I just wish I didn’t have IBS in general."

dating_advice,fiz3zus,t1_fiz29rg,1582853607.0,"Don’t burn yourself out with dating apps. Regardless what you go for, it’s mostly meant to mess with your self esteem, whether it’s through algorithms or people. 

I’ve used Tinder, Okcupid, Hinge, PoF, Skout, Zoosk and the results I had are the same. Doesn’t matter how much effort I put in, even if I pay for the service, it’ll be the same crap.

I remember coming onto Reddit one time before making an account and I wanted to see dating apps tips and tricks. One poster, who I don’t remember their handle, said something that made me think differently and it made a lot of sense. If you’re the type of person that thinks highly of themself and doesn’t have low self esteem, dating apps are not for you. 

I know I’m better than that. Letting algorithms making me think I’m an unattractive person just because no one swipes right on me and if they do I won’t know about it unless I cough up cash, just hell no. I’m in no rush. I’m not desperate. I may long for a date or a relationship after 11 years of my last relationship, but I can wait. I’m not going to die just because I’m single. 

I rather meet someone new and fall for someone whether it’s through group activities or bumping into them randomly when life decides to.



And to those that actually find someone on there, congratulations, you’re the lucky ones. I’m being sincere on that. Seeing that happen reminds me that dating apps aren’t for everyone. It’ll work for some and it’ll not work for the rest.




Edit: Correcting you’re are to you’re. Don’t know how I missed that after rereading it a couple of times."
CreditCards,fixo1n6,t1_fixm6vz,1582823888.0,"That, I have learned recently. I've been banking with them for almost four years now. I did get my first increase about a month or three months after getting the Platinum card as they promised if I were to pay on time. I got my second increase last month. 

&#x200B;

Good question. That's something I haven't thought about yet. Venture One is still new to me and from what I see so far I'm liking it. Haven't booked a trip yet. Apple Card I'm liking because most transactions pend in a day, thus getting cash back more quicker. Bank of America, you can choose what is the 3% cash back category and change it whenever you want.

&#x200B;

To pick one out of three, I would go for Bank of America just because I can choose what that 3% cash back will be. We may look at the card as for one thing (other than spending lol), but down the road that'll change, thus knowing that option is always available is a big plus for me."
CreditCards,fixi4oh,t1_fixeldi,1582820798.0,"They've must've changed things then.

&#x200B;

Hmm. If I were you I wouldn't open another card as of yet. Give it a few months before opening another one. From what I see it shouldn't be an issue to get another card. As long as you can afford and manage it.

&#x200B;

As for your next card, I would look into a travel card. Wells Fargo, ever since I've heard about the scandal they've done a few years back I wouldn't even want to look at them. Chase, they're a bit tough. When I first tried to apply with them they denied me, thus leading me to think I need to start with a secure credit card (I was starting to figure out the credit card world). The rep at Capital One mentioned I didn't need to do that and also mentioned Chase is a bit harder to sign up with. 

&#x200B;

I would say do your research. I could pick out a card I would recommend, but it may not work out for you. I personally have Capital One, Apple Card, Bank of America, and Dell, even though its for their store only. Capital One I had a Platinum with no rewards. Recently they've sent me an email if I wanted to upgrade to Quicksilver or Venture One. I chose Venture One because the other two credit cards (Apple and Bank of America) already do cash rewards."
CreditCards,fixdomz,t3_fadm4i,1582818330.0,"In my case I saw the hard check being reported to both TransUnion and Equifax. I don't check the other one since Credit Karma nor Turbo doesn't provide info for them, but I'm assuming they got the same thing as well. Mind you this was before they started to report to TransUnion.

&#x200B;

I want to assume it'll be the same scenario now that they are reporting to TransUnion only, but I want to hear other's stories about this.

&#x200B;

Btw, I now have two different credit scores. I have a higher one with Equifax. Yes, it is normal to have two different scores at some point if you didn't know that already. Once I saw this happened I wanted to know if others have a similar situation and if its ok for a bank to report to only one bureau.

single,fiwcupf,t3_fa6aw9,1582781495.0,"Pretty much on the same boat. Only had one relationship (barely a relationship) about 11 years ago, suffer from general anxiety and general depression, introverted, and I work full time during the day and always seeking out some days to have my me time. I have talked and flirted online since then, but in general I’m mixed. Some days I’m perfectly fine being single and some days, like today, I would want to be in a relationship. 

I always blamed my anxiety for holding me back, but really I shouldn’t. Around the time I was falling for this girl I was also learning about my anxiety. I only knew about the butterflies. No one ever told me sometimes bees can come to play too. I feel like that plays a role for me and truthfully I would rather feel the butterflies only.

tmobile,finwqq0,t3_f8rm9j,1582571726.0,"Sorry this happened to you. Been with T-Mobile for about six years I think and the worst I’ve seen yet on my account is having the online portal disabled. One day I wanted to sign in so I can see the prices available if I were to do payments on a phone and I came across an error message stating my account is disabled. Had to check to see if it meant my service was disabled or just the online portal. Thankfully it was the online portal. Oddly enough I could still access that portal through the T-Mobile app.

Contacted T-Mobile through Twitter and they’ve asked if I have requested to not have an online portal. In my head I was laughing because that’s the only way I pay my bill through. I told her no, she found it odd, and she restored it. Her assumption was someone was trying to log in with too many attempts to the other numbers that are on my line. Practically no one else uses that. I’ve asked my family members and they said no.

Told her my suspicion was someone trying to get into my account. The only thing she suggested was to reset the passwords often.

My other suspicion is if that was really the case, shouldn’t I have gotten an error message stating for too many log-in attempts is the reason why it’s disabled rather than stating it’s just disabled?"

Sometimes unplugging it and plugging it back in works. Sometimes pretending to reset by unplugging it, plugging it back in, and press down the middle before it beeps (red circle) would do the trick. And sometimes wiping it clean and starting fresh would do it too.

When it comes to automation that all works given the fact the automation process is by the Philips Hue app and not HomeKit. 

The only two suspicions I have is the possible compatibility of the router and the fact there may have been a flaw with this HomePod. This was a non-retail packaged HomePod, which they failed to mentioned it was either refurbished or used."

If I were to ask the same command on the Apple TV or iPhone it’ll work. Only last night I had a weird occurrence where the Apple TV didn’t work, but I ended up manually controlling it on the phone. I didn’t think to try Siri on the phone.

Mind you, I lost count in how many times I have resetted the damn thing to get it working again. Unplugged it and plug it back in, pretending to reset (holding the “button” down and letting go before it beeps), and actually wiping it clean. If it works it’ll be for that small moment.


The thing that bothers me is the firmware itself. I know it’s based on iOS, but why does it suck compared to other devices with Siri on it? Is it that buggy that Apple doesn’t want to iron out?"
