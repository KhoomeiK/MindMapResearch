rape,fpdv9mf,t3_gcv78w,1588534932.0,"i think he’s hyper-aware of his actions, he knows what he did is abnormal (but maybe not “wrong” in his eyes) and is trying to see your reaction to the abnormality in order to catergoize how to proceed with a relationship with you. I think it’s important to keep in mind on WHY he’s telling you this story. Is it really to be honest and open and create a conversation of “i regret i did this, help me change”? Or is it more of a conversation of him trying to justify himself being a rapist by trying to make you feel bad that he was expelled and “didn’t realize what he did was wrong” even though he maybe very aware that it was. And in return, wants you to agree that the school punishing him was too far because “he already realize himself what he did was bad” and therefore justifying rape in his head that it’s okay to do to someone because in a way, he had your “acceptance”. Rapists will always flip situations like this. 

Either 1) he didn’t realize he raped someone (being drunk, doesn’t understand that co-ericon is rape, etc.) and the ex made him aware that it was, and in return he regrets putting someone in a situation he didn’t pre-mediate nor may have not realized that he was exhibiting his risk factors unto others that may cause situations like rape to transpire. But tbh, that’s giving a person a lot of credit who openly admitted to raping someone. Or 2) he pre-meditate a rape in his head (maybe not directly towards the ex, just planning “to rape” in a very subconscious way) and the ex just happen to be an easy victim, and now he’s testing the waters with you. He maybe trying to gain your sympathy, by thinking “i know i raped someone, but they punished me for it. isn’t that so shitty? feel bad for me”. And maybe he’s hoping by being honest with you, that you might forgive him in the future if a sexual encounter between you two turned into a power control and/or rape itself. 

And this not a dig at you whatsoever. But you mentioned being a survivor and i know from my personal experience when dealing with survivor-hood, that sometimes to others I came off as “more sensitive”, “child like naïveness”, and “vulnerable” without realizing it. Rapists seek out these traits in people. There’s nothing wrong with anyone possessing these behaviors, but it can make it easier for rapists to manipulate unfortunately. I was targeted by a guy in high school who was known to be mean to girls and use them for sex, and some of these traits that i had made it easier for him to get me to the point of trust that he could finally rape me. I am not saying this happening to you, but i think it’s something that happens a lot but may not be thought it as first when dealing with issues like this one. 

In my opinion and being a survivor as well, I would not trust anyone who would tell me this. Even if they don’t know what I have been through, rapists don’t change if they find out one of their victims has already been raped. They are incapable of feeling empathy on the level of a normal being. It’s physical impossible in most cases with psycho/socio-paths especially (there’s a strong correlation between psycho/socio-pathy and rape). Now, i could be very very wrong about all of this. But the one telling sign of this whole thing being super fishy? The fact that he told you he raped someone to begin with. You don’t know the truth and honestly you never will. The truth lays in the experience of the day it happened. So in order to keep yourself extra safe, my advice would be to leave this person quickly. 

I’m sorry your dealing with this, you don’t deserve it and it is probably extremely confusing. But just remember to always listen to your gut, you always come first, and you’re very valid and welcomed in this world with open arms. I wish you the best."
adultsurvivors,foybg00,t1_fow9unt,1588169401.0,"honestly i still struggle with this. sometimes i think “i was actually raped, you were just groped at a party”... i didn’t keep in mind everyone’s trauma affects them differently. but at the same time it’s really hard for me to equate being actually raped and just being touched inappropriately at a party—to me one is a lot more shitter than the other. theyre both shitty honestly, i’ve had both happen to me. so it’s difficult to wrap my head around this. however i am learning, i cannot compare my trauma to others and I cannot judge those who are consumed by the same trauma I am. 

i just wish it never happened. now being forced to figure out how to live life through trauma, i always have to check myself and make sure i am still the person who i know i am at my core: selfless and accepting. rape and trauma can turn us into people we never thought we would be."

I didn’t want sex, I never consented to sex, my ex bf raped me, how the hell did my current bf come to this conclusion??? Oh yeah he’s a narcissist that’s why. He views me as a sub-category to himself and in return put himself in that situation I was in and analyzed what he would have done differently and judge me for allowing an ex to touch me that ended up in him forcing himself onto me.

March 20th is a day I will always hate, but March 19th is the day that I got really high, watched the video for this album, and had an experience like no other. Such a strong experience with this music, that I took it with me on a hike to a secret waterfall I discovered years ago, I allowed myself to escape my head for an hour and to absorb the beautiful nature around me along with the music that makes me feel like I’ve lived a life of freedom and safety—it had me made feel as if no had ever touched my body with ill will and I was my own savior."
rape,fkidloa,t1_fkiak2f,1584217517.0,"I only said your comment could guilt the victim because of how you worded it. It was very strongly worded without keeping in mind the context and OP’s own relief that one who cause her pain cannot anymore to her and no one else. If what you said wasn’t meant to be related to only rape and just a general notion of not being okay with celebrating anyone’s death, maybe this isn’t the right place to say it? I get what you mean wholeheartedly and it has good intentions—we shouldn’t celebrate death. I agree with that. However, my own personal outlook on this is: the deaths of my rapists will be harmonious in the sense that the universe gave them what they deserved. The only deaths I would ever be happy about it are those ones. But am I going to use my life to wait for that happen? No. But when it does I will know that my body is finally safe. 

True rapists don’t change. They aren’t fully human regarding empathy. And at times they don’t deserve the same respect. With them it is harder to teach them the lesson of being the bigger person—unfortunately they can only learn and really be affected by negative action if it is within their same realm of emotionlessness. I’m sharing this with you since I know a lot of other survivors feel this way, and just wanted to give you the perspective to why some think it’s okay to be happy about a death of a rapist. 

I wish you the best as well! :’)"

rape,fkhj46q,t1_fkh5d78,1584200040.0,"are you kidding me? Being raped to some, if not all, feels like death without dying. A piece of you died during the rape and will never come back. Yes OP shouldn’t be going outside and shouting this death to the heavens, but to share it with an anonymous online community regarding rape? Yes that’s totally okay. 

Suicidal rape survivors =/= suicidal rapists

There may be a plethora of reasons for both, but given that rapists have caused intentional harm and predisposition mental health issues unto their survivors, it’s not far to guilt OP here with that comment. Nor is it fair to compare the suicidal mind of a rape survivor and that same mind of a rapist. The rape survivor may be suicidal solely due to the rape—the rapist may be suicidal due to a lack of power in ones life in any context, a family, or a personal matter. Or it could be a mixture of both for both parties. However, studies show that majority of rapists are narcissists and/or full fledge/borderline psycho/socio-pathic, chances are their suicidal ideation is coming from a place of “woe is me” where a survivor is coming from a place of “I cannot survive in a body anymore that doesn’t feel like mine”. 

Of course this is just an observation with these studies in mind, but after spending time around offenders, I found many rapists just feel bad for themselves and don’t think about their victims once. Even at their height of their depression and ideation. Because, bottom line is: rapists only seek power, once their power is gone, they are gone and will result back to more humanely instincts to deal with the “pain” of being a rapist who doesn’t have access to victims anymore. 

I hope you mean well by this but I also really encourage you to change your perspective regarding this correlation."

You don’t deserve that, you should be able to go see your favorite band without any problem. with that being said, i understand how you feel. After i was raped, i had to see my rapist everyday at school. Andddd after school at soccer practice since both boys and girls teams shared the same field. it was awful. but i got through it. and i think you can too. 
 
You could go to the concert, appear strong and unfazed, and it might piss him off. Rape is about power, he used his power over you. He tried to take your power. Show him you never lost your power and exert it by enjoying yourself, listening to music you always wanted to hear live. The only person you need to worry about now is yourself and trust me i know it’s hard to not worry about the one who hurt you the most and whether or not they will do it again. But if you are safe, remain in a public area with a friend(s) and bring pepper spray/taser if capable of doing so, then it can be possible to avoid him altogether. if you have an iphone, make sure your emergency call settings are on, share your constant location with someone who is not at the concert, and give updates to that same person to when you arrived and when you’re leaving. It may be overkill, but it will keep you safe. 

He’s a piece of shit rapist. He’s an evil person who thinks it would be “fun” for you to see him. He doesn’t deserve to even breathe. And you know what he is capable of, so if you are seriously thinking about going, i would talk about it with people close to you as well. If your gut is telling you not to go, do not go. If anything feels off about the situation right when you get there, leave. I know it will be hard and i know it’s not fair that survivors have to take so much precaution in situations like these, let allow have to be stuck with the trauma and years of learning to heal from something we didn’t ask for—but you can get through it. It is possible to feel confident when facing this situation, just mentally prepare yourself for any out come and always be on alert. I hope you make the best decision for you, you’re the only person in the whole world who will always know what’s best for you. I believe in you!"

rape,fh8jfpo,t3_f1tmr6,1581361015.0,"I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. My only question is: did you distinctly say “yes”? If so, I think it’s very important for you to really understand that yes, this is something that you consented to, but there was still a power dynamic in place. Like a previous comment already posted, society forces us to think that at 18, legal age of consent, that the person consenting is 100% ready for that commitment. You may have thought at the time you were, but now you’re realizing that it’s something you wish you didn’t consent to. But that’s all there is to it: you did something that you regret under the circumstances of wanting to do it with good faith at the time. This is really important to understand and the difference between this situation and rape. 

However at the same time, you can still feel violated. You now have a clearer mind, you now know what you want and what you wish you didn’t do. All you can do now is use this as a learning experience. You can grow from this, you can feel good again. It’s okay to feel what you are feeling, you have every right to feel this way. The worst thing to do is to overthink the situation, turning into something in your mind that makes it feel more of an assault like situation. It sounds like in the moment, you didn’t feel like it was assault. But now you do and it’s confusing, so I encourage you to have a clear understanding of yourself and what you want before you have sex with someone again. 

My advice would be to write everything down on how this situation made you feel and to write a reminder on the same paper, that this was something that you did consent to. Then you should write some statements on how this situation is something you would NEVER want to consent to again for x, y, and z reasons. This way, you can categorize your thoughts, get a clear understanding to what you want in your life when it comes to sex and relationships and what type of person you would to share those experiences with. I am not blaming you for consenting to this, we all make mistakes and have regrets. And the good thing is, we do not have to repeat them if we learn how to prevent them and apply our tactics. Again, I’m sorry you’re feeling this way and you did nothing wrong. I believe that you can heal from this, you’re already off to a good start by talking about it. :)"
rape,fh8h42l,t1_fh8f6iw,1581359604.0,"I’m sorry if the men you have been with have you made feel like this. Men have made me feel like this in the past when they are seeking casual sex, but made it seem like they wanted something more and left me under the impression that the sex would have more meaning to them. However, this statement can be hurtful and is not a factual thing, just a matter of your opinion and that’s okay. I think given OP’s situation, giving an opinion like this can be reallyyyyy confusing. Reality is, men can have causal sex with women with  no intentions of being them since the women may not have any intentions of being serious as well. 

Every situation is different, but i understand where you are coming from. Before having sex, the pair should always have clear communication of defining their relationship and what the intentions of the sex will be. You have a right to your opinion and i respect it, but keep in mind that it does come across as bias and too narrowed down for OP’s situation. We should keep an open mind as much as possible when assisting and giving advice for confusing sexual situations that may or may not categorized as assault. Just something to keep in mind and my intention for this comment is simply just to let you know how your statement may come across—no hard feelings here."

It’s okay. It’s normal for your brain to do that to protect yourself. Now what you should do is, is figure out a way to start healing the trauma. Wether that’s signing up to go see a therapist or find the strength to start opening up to people in your life about it. You do not have to tell anyone and your strong whether you said anything or not, however if you do have a supportive family/friend relationships, telling them will take a hugeeeee load off of you. 

They may not be able to fully relate, no one ever will unfortunately. This experience is your experience, your right to share it, and your right in choosing on how to deal with it. I’m so sorry it happened to you. You can live life normally and happily with this in your past, even if right now you feel like you can’t. I really encourage you to seek out any resources nearby in order to educate yourself in healing your trauma, understanding the situation and the effects from it really helped me.

Mediums,fapf4e9,t3_eabcbo,1576286984.0,"i felt a sense of peace and happiness between you two before i even read your caption...that being said, the energy of those two things is very still much alive if anyone is able to feel them. His physical body may not be here, but his soul is still alive with you. I wish you the best and i’m so sorry for your loss."

AmItheAsshole,fae9gyg,t1_fae8sqs,1575996538.0,I’ve been moved out since October 25th. My name is not on the lease anymore since both forms were signed so I have no legal obligation to the space.

trashy,ezmq3zu,t1_ezmou82,1567995571.0,"Because my ex (who is Mexican) created fake texts coming from “me” (they came from his own snapchat account that he claimed I “hacked” and was messaging him through so the texts literally look like he’s texting himself). In these fake texts, it shows “me” telling him I’m going to deport him and for him to “have fun in that cage”. He posted it to twitter with a caption saying how racist I am with my full name and Twitter handle. Him and I’s mutual friends called him out under the tweet, saying he’s making it up and that he’s trying to deflect from the truth (that he raped me) and wants to look like a victim himself. Somehow the tweet got really popular with other people outside my state and friend circle, and strangers didn’t fully understand the whole context so took what he said about me as truth and started sending these types of messages to me."

trashy,ezlt4oj,t1_ezlsg3h,1567981194.0,"If you really want to I can send it to you, i’m just not sure if that would be doxing. Her whole Twitter account is basically her bullying people, especially white people and people who just don’t agree with her in general. Funny thing is: when I found her Facebook, I was going through her photos and found one from 2016. It was an article in her local paper about how she created an anti-bullying campaign at her school.... 3 years later and she’s the bully herself. Probably always has been.  V sad."
trashy,ezllewp,t1_ezlkqyi,1567978225.0,My ex and my rapist. I’m not sure what an “ex rapist” would be.
trashy,ezl4e16,t1_ezl1522,1567971774.0,"Thank you... i’m so sorry for your experience. I know it all too well. People don’t want to realize that evils like rape exist in the world and even within their circle of friends and family. He has done so much damage to me and I’m getting tired of it. Getting messages like these from strangers who don’t even know the whole situation is heartbreaking and just pure malicious. I don’t understand that mindset of bullying someone you don’t even know, wishing death upon them. I don’t even wish death upon my rapist, I am better than that. I wish you a lot of peace."
trashy,ezl28hl,t3_d1f419,1567970551.0,"Thanks for the responses everyone, I searched through her twitter and was able to find her real name. I’ll be going to the my city’s police department today."
