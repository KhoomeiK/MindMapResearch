It got exhausting answering questions about it all and I just wanted a normal life and to talk about normal things. But if she brings it up, don’t mentioned that she looks good or anything related to appearance. Ask about the friends she made (I’m still friends with girls I went to treatment with 10 years ago), ask her what she’s excited about moving forward, etc. You sound like a good friend so I wouldn’t worry too much!"
ptsd,f87zxgf,t1_f85jwri,1574345985.0,Haha I’ll look into that! They are well behaved- sometimes they annoy each other and will get mad and just let out a scream 😑  but it’s mainly their toys that bother me... playing with barbies and then dropping it on the floor on accident- things that people don’t even think about are super loud and unsettling to me now. Even things like the turning of a door knob if I’m not expecting it or turning on the sink. So I should have made the emphasis on that instead of my kids! My two year old had just screamed so that’s what was on my mind haha! But I’m still going to check out what you mentioned! Thank you!!

EatingDisorders,f4g748z,t3_dke70g,1571578207.0,Look at Project Heal for grants and payment plans. And there is a link at the bottom to send a complaint about insurance. One of the girls that started a chapter had to fight insurance for a couple of years. It’s exhausting. But sometimes persistence gets noticed. Here is the link [Project Heal](https://www.theprojectheal.org/treatment-access-program-1)
EatingDisorders,eya2eh9,t3_cwdos7,1566957118.0,"Do you have access to therapy/ counseling? Maybe a school counselor? Recovery is very hard and doing it alone is even harder. Eating disorder behaviors are outward signs of internal struggle so talking to a trusted adult would be very beneficial. It’s hard to stop the behaviors when nothing is changing mentally if that makes sense. But just from a behavior point of view- there won’t always be motivation and it definitely won’t feel good or easy. Try challenging yourself to do opposite actions. If the ed voice is telling you to restrict, eat anyway etc. And please reach out to someone!"
EatingDisorders,ey9qoaj,t1_ey9ng6m,1566950052.0,"It sounds like an unhealthy obsessed and fear. I obviously can’t diagnose or tell you what you’ve been doing is binging or whatever. But I can tell you are more than stressed about this. And don’t apologize! You are welcome to pm me any time! I wouldn’t view that as “damage.” I might view it as your body needs more food. So by restricting more, it’s only going to get worse. And that’s great you are going to see a counselor! I think it will help! You can also look for free groups in your area. That’s where I started before my family found out. And I’m like you in that’s sense- I will tell a complete stranger my entire life story but I am not at all comfortable talking to my family about anything. But living in food hell is awful. You need some guidance while you try to figure out behaviors. You might need more help than a counselor. It’s awkward telling your family but they will eventually find out anyway if you just get more sucked into it. That’s what happened to me. But multiple treatment centers and 9.5 years later, it’s a lot easier!"
EatingDisorders,ey9hr0b,t1_ey9anrt,1566943600.0,"I was just incorporating them. I struggled with anorexia purge type and actually never really binged. I did deal with extreme hunger and ate more but it would not be classified as a binge. The ed was telling me I lost control. But because I’m pretty far along in recovery I was able to “catch it, challenge it, and change it.” So I caught the lie,-“(fear food) is bad,” challenged it- “if this food supposedly makes me fat, why can everyone on earth eat it and it not make them fat?” And changed it- “this is a main food group that gives me energy and I need it to survive. I will not all of a sudden become ‘fat’ from a healthy caloric intake.” 

When I have a fear food and end up wanting to eat it all the time, I put it in my “diet.” I was scared of chocolate too which made me want it ALL the time. So instead of restricting it, I stopped about twice a week and got a chocolate bar. And after a couple of weeks my body realized I wasn’t going to be restricting it anymore and stopped craving it. But I can’t stop eating chocolate altogether because I’ll become fearful of it again. So if I want it I’ll eat it. Exposure will be a great thing! It’s terrifying but it gets easier!

Our bodies fluctuate! So what if you gain weight? Logistically, why is it a traumatic feeling? What bad thing will happen? (As long as you are in a healthy range). I’ll tell you my experience- I was underweight so I gained a lot of weight over the years. I also gained my personality, a sense of humor, friends, freedom, I was able to carry two kids, I got married, I can walk and not have to sit, I can play outside with my family, etc. Weight is just a number. It doesn’t change who you are if it goes up or down. And I promise you will like who you are once the ed is silenced. I was so scared I wouldn’t like who I was without it. But that’s a lie. 

Do you have a treatment team? Or a therapist? The cycle of restricting and binging is exhausted and very very hard physically and mentally."
EatingDisorders,ey80t8i,t3_cw2911,1566907971.0,A turning point for me was realizing it didn’t have to feel right to do it. It felt awful and foreign and bad. And then it just gets easier. Keep pushing through even if it feels wrong. Constantly challenge yourself over and over again until each thing isn’t a big deal anymore. It does get easier and it really is worth it!
EatingDisorders,ey80k3m,t3_cw29nz,1566907740.0,"This was literally me a few months ago. I started a food plan and exercise plan and my relationship with food and my body had never been better. Until a few weeks in when I spiraled. It happens really fast. I just had to take three weeks off to get my mind back in the right place. I really thought I would be fine. So please be careful! I would recommend getting a trainer, therapist, dietician, etc., just someone that will guide you and be able to call you out if you start slipping."
EatingDisorders,ey7zzwi,t3_cw2d8l,1566907218.0,"I feel I am in a similar situation and might have a little advice. I had been fit my whole life and was always doing something competitive. I’ve had two kids over the past few years so my body is obviously different. I felt like I was in a good place in recovery (been in recovery 9.5 years) and decided to start weight training. Not body building but I wanted to get very lean and strong. And after about 5 weeks I spiraled into restriction and cutting out food groups entirely and not going out and avoiding social get togethers. I am an all or nothing type person too. It doesn’t make sense in my head to not be that way. But we really need to try. I don’t want to live in a disordered mind set so I stopped my food plan and stopped working out until I wasn’t scared to not do it. It’s been three weeks now and I took measurements and I haven’t changed AT ALL. Which was honestly shocking but proved the point that our bodies can do what we think they can’t. We can skip the gym and be fine. We can eat what we are scared of and be fine. Three weeks of eating my fear foods every single day and NO change happened.

I feel like it’s easier for me because of all the treatment I have gotten in my life. If someone had told me “just stop going to the gym” or “just eat normal food” a couple of years ago, I would have told them it was impossible and that even if I wanted to I couldn’t. I am a firm believer that therapy is the way to go. Every single one of my therapists told me my behaviors were a symptom of something. A very serious symptom, but a symptom. So my advice is to find someone you can talk to. Figure out what is causing this need for control/ obsession/ whatever it is and then work on that. Because it gets more miserable. You can figure out a healthy balance of diet and exercise and not be a prisoner in your mind. I also think you can hit your goals without the bad obsession being there. But first focus on your mental health. I promise it gets easier!"
EatingDisorders,ey7yksq,t3_cw2f2l,1566905852.0,"I remember being in a position of not being able to get better without help. It’s scary. Can you look into an online therapist? One you can video call? 

What helped me was exposure- challenging myself. If eating breakfast feels impossible, feel like crap and do it anyway. It’s ok for things to feel foreign and not right. They are going to feel that way for a while. It was a turning point for me when I realized recovery didn’t have to feel good or right. It was going to be terrible but it wouldn’t feel so bad forever. 

I would really look into online therapy though. Sometimes we just can’t do it without help."
EatingDisorders,evybiyn,t1_evx84jm,1564928378.0,That’s awesome! My insurance only covers for my state so I would need to find something that I can drive to everyday that’s close. Thank you so much for your reply!
EatingDisorders,evybgmu,t1_evwkp1y,1564928329.0,Really? It’s so frustrating. And insurance is so frustrating. Thank you for your reply!
EatingDisorders,evviomh,t1_evvhqtv,1564838224.0,"(I’m op) That’s what I’m worried about. I don’t need a 12 step program, I mainly need help for the ptsd and derealization which I’m hoping will create a positive response in ed recovery. I think am going to try to start seeing my therapist more and hope it helps because there just aren’t any ed treatment places. The annoying part is there is a residential treatment place 35 minutes away but it’s in a different state. So frustrating! Your reply was very helpful! Thank you so much!"
EatingDisorders,evvidxd,t1_evvdrlm,1564837933.0,"(I’m op) And I went through the same thing! When I got back from inpatient and residential they put me in iop but it was so easy to manipulate and they kicked me out and told me to go back inpatient. I do feel like I’m in a place where I want to try. I was trying to relapse then and now I’m trying to get better so I’m hoping that will make a difference! I used to have substance issues 10 years ago when I was hospitalized but I don’t now, so I’m concerned the 12 steps will be the main focus and that’s not at all what I need. I mainly need help for the ptsd and derealization. This was helpful! Thank you so much for your reply!"
EatingDisorders,evvi54u,t1_evv6kvv,1564837697.0,(I’m op) This is good to know! I’m sorry it wasn’t great. It really sucks when time and money is spent and it’s not a good fit. And I was wondering about the 12 steps part of it. I don’t need the 12 steps I mainly need help for the ptsd/ derealization and am hoping that in turn will help the ed relapse if that makes sense. I am going to see if I can start seeing my therapist more to see if that helps. It doesn’t seem like an addiction place would be best for me! Thank you so much for your reply!
rape,evti470,t3_cl7kkt,1564770887.0,"I can’t answer all of those questions. But I started recovering memories 20 years after. I had no memories until then. But I lived in constant depression, anxiety, ptsd, and was hospitalized by an eating disorder. I felt like I was crazy for not knowing why. Now that I know it makes sense and I can make peace with it eventually. So just in my experience, I would have wanted to know."
ptsd,evtfnx2,t1_evtbu0o,1564769382.0,Ok that’s good to know! And I was mainly talking about the professionals- I should have added that. Like 10 years ago when my parents took my to my pediatrician he was like yeah you’re underweight but just eat better and exercise. Obviously that advice almost killed me and I ended up inpatient. I’m just nervous to not be surrounded by other eating disorder patients because the eating disorder mind is SO easily triggered by everything (super annoying).
derealization,evshinh,t1_evs1wtp,1564746476.0,Really? Because I am not seeing things from far away which is what I read that is. I honestly don’t even know. I just want whatever it is to stop
EatingDisorders,evck8tc,t3_cj8zlm,1564417110.0,"I used an ed to help with anxiety. I still do even though I’m trying to fully recover. I don’t think anyone can diagnose online but it’s definitely not normal to make yourself sick. So whether that’s an eating disorder or disordered eating, whatever criteria you meet doesn’t really matter, I would start seeing a therapist to help with the underlying issue. Eating disorders are serious and deadly but they are symptoms of something else."
EatingDisorders,euganii,t3_cgb3qk,1563803950.0,You aren’t alone. Even after 9 years of recovery I still have the same thoughts. But recovery is so much better than staying in the ed. You have to push though even though you might not want to and once you reach the other side it really is so much better. I have an actual life now. The ed life will kill you.
survivorsofabuse,eu4l1b8,t3_ceqlt0,1563456953.0,I do. I dress very modestly and have to cover everything. Sometimes it’s frustrating because I go to the gym 4 days a week and I have such a hard time finding enough oversized tee shirts. But if I don’t I feel like people are constantly staring and seeing the parts of me that are damaged. If that makes sense? I’m trying to work through it
EatingDisorders,eta0rqn,t3_caj1ra,1562609643.0,Did you tell your therapist at php? Are they considered binges or could it be extreme hunger? Transitioning is really hard. It gets better
EatingDisorders,et9zm9g,t3_caj1t9,1562608905.0,"I don’t have a ton of advice, but I know when I went to (previously known as) Remuda Ranch, they did some admissions based on income. If you have any sort of job that brings in income I would call around and ask places if they do that. For parents- mine were passive for a few months when my friends made me tell them. Only when a friend approached and told them literally everything did they bring me home from college to send me inpatient. So maybe taking them to a session? It’s so hard and awkward and throughout recovery you will have to fight for yourself. But you are strong and you can do it!"

EatingDisorders,es8fwk3,t3_c6bon6,1561696525.0,"In my personal experience (because everyone is different and I am not a doctor) I had to be forced to stop. Before my husband, my parents sent me to inpatient. Now that I’m married, when I struggle my husband reminds me that our kids can’t be around that and that in order to protect them they will have to stay somewhere else until I decide to get it under control. The ultimatums work for me. I’m now at a place where I actively fight it instead of constantly giving in. So I think it also depends on where your so is at. I just know that before I went to inpatient (and before any type of help) I was in so deep I couldn’t get out of it on my own. I fought recovery until I was actually in it and decided I wanted a life. But it was ultimately up to me. I guess what I am trying to say is you might have to try different approaches to see what works. Ultimatums are not ideal for every situation, but I would likely be dead right now if it weren’t for them. It will be hard to talk about but if your so is doing this often, then it needs to be brought up again. They might decide they want to continue to live like that but how you respond and your part in it is up to you. I’m sorry they are struggling with that. It really does suck for everyone involved. I hope they choose help."
EatingDisorders,es8f1i8,t3_c6eea5,1561695721.0,"Eating disorders are so tricky and the lies are so believable. But remember that you typically aren’t recommended to get help unless there’s an actual problem. I would trust them and go with it and I can pretty much guarantee once you look back, you will see it. I was forced into inpatient and still had to sometimes ask my therapist if I actually had an ed. But looking back it almost killed me and it’s hard for me to see how I ever believed I didn’t. Even though it’s confusing, stick with it- you will be glad you did."
EatingDisorders,es8eh7v,t3_c6eebp,1561695206.0,"I went to Remuda Ranch in 2010. I was terrified but it ended up being one of the best things to ever happen. It wasn’t like a jail. And because I was 19 I could have signed myself out (my parents were in charge so by their rules I couldn’t) but I didn’t want to. I didn’t want recovery when I went but I left fighting for it. I was there 9 years ago so it’s kind of hard to remember the exact schedule but here is the gist of it. We woke up and got ready in the same room because all of our stuff was contraband. Then we had our vitals taken and were weighed. Then ate breakfast and got our stuff together. The rest of the morning was filled with group sessions and classes. We had a massive workbook that we used and would work on a new chapter. Then snack and more groups. Then lunch and individual therapy then snack and then chapel and then dinner and down time and then snack and then by 730 we were heading back to our rooms for bed. Weekends were more laid back. We had equine therapy and then a lot of free time or they would have crafts for us. During meals we couldn’t wear long sleeves or anything with pockets and we had to keep our hands on the table. Inpatient was really freaking hard. They had so many rules but it almost felt relieving that you could escape the world while you got better. And I’m still close to some of the girls. I’ve never met more understanding, kind, fun, and encouraging people. And the nurses were great too. They really got to know us as individuals. We played games some nights with a therapist, there was a guitar there and a girl who was there with me would play songs. We just understood each other and were able to fully be ourselves without the world judging. Because recovery is hard and emotionally draining and you have to face a lot of hard things. Inpatient was a safe place for me. If you have the opportunity to go, I absolutely would! And feel free to ask me any questions!"
EatingDisorders,ersmvhy,t3_c3e5yz,1561218637.0,By diet I am thinking you mean a lifestyle that helps maintain instead of gain? I am 9 years into recovery and I just started a healthy lifestyle change that does include knowing calories and I struggle with that. But I have been able to remain healthy because.. 9 years. A dietician/ nutritionist needs to be who you speak with. Let them deal with the calories and you follow a meal plan like in the beginning of recovery. It’s really hard to try to figure out healthy lifestyles on your own in ed recovery without it getting obsessive or without your brain making foods “bad.” At least it is for me. Just remember eating disorders are tricky and can slip in without you realizing it.
EatingDisorders,eqfx5hw,t1_eqcuuwy,1560028261.0,I have been doing a little cbt! I can only go to therapy once a month so I don’t think big progress with that will be very quick. But I have gotten some great tools to use out of it! Thank you! ETA- I’m the op
EatingDisorders,eqfx0r3,t1_eqfla7x,1560028195.0,"Thanks for the insight! A lot of times things are black and white for me. For ex- I fixed the problem and the ed should go away haha. So it’s actually relieving to remember it’s not that way. And I’m usually only triggered by my weight and body and not by emotions. Anxiety used to drive it. And typing this out I realized when I feel like I have a lot of weight on my body I get super anxious and then I start to relapse. So anxiety is also still a part I guess. So body image is really what I need to work on ugh. I don’t think that will ever get better.

intermittentfasting,eqbg1hx,t1_eqbbucf,1559948977.0,Thank you so much for the feedback! All I’ve known is what my brain has deemed safe foods and unsafe foods in regards to the eating disorder so it was pretty irrational. Nutrition didn’t matter even after years of having a dietitian. So I’m kind of new to all of this. And a lot of the foods I’m learning are good for me are big fear foods so I’m glad the general consensus is that it’s all in my head and these foods will actually be good for my body! I don’t have the option to work out in a fasted state and protein and fats have made me a little nauseas to workout on so I’m going to switch to protein and carbs! Thanks again!
