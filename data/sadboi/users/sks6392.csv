depression,fqfyh0x,t3_gibavz,1589334217.0,"I was suicidal when I was in college. I was so miserable and lacked motivation to do anything. I slept all day, gained 20 pounds and cried all the time. I was so depressed at one point that I didn't do an assignment and when the teacher asked me why I didn't hand it in, I made up some bullshit excuse and got a zero. 

Honestly, what helped me was knowing that being in school isn't forever and if I put in the work now, the faster I could go back home with people who love and care about me. Knowing that I was just avoiding things made me even more depressed because I would just be putting myself back in the same shitty situation later on."
LittleFiresEverywhere,fntscgy,t1_fntegie,1587247739.0,"I dont understand this either. In the flashback I was expecting some incident that would explain her hate for white people but there was nothing. She has this superior attitude against Elena from the second they meet and all Elena was doing was offering her a place to live! I can't stand Mia.

Understand the author is trying to explain race dynamics but i think there needs to be a specific reason why the hate from Mia."

AskReddit,fng46o7,t3_g1k6op,1586921913.0,"Wow there are so many but a really important life lesson I think is don't try to bullshit your way out of your mistakes. Just own up to them and be honest because trying to cover them up and lie is just going to make it worse.

Also, don't be afraid to take a job that you think is below you and be humble in everything you do. You never know who or what will come back to you in a future job."

GilmoreGirls,fneef2w,t3_fzq6ug,1586887891.0,"My opinion changes everytime I watch the show. 

I'm rewatching the show now and I'm finding lorelai selfish, self-centered, and a bad parent. When rory slept with Dean and when she stole the boat, she needed lorelai to be a mother-not a best friend. 

I also can't stand the way she treats her parents. Granted, Emily isn't the most perfect human being either but still. You are an adult lorelai, grow up. 

I wish we got more more insight of lorelais childhood, maybe her actions against Emily would be more justified..."

mentalhealth,fhfsc2e,t3_f2ngy6,1581550159.0,"Im sorry you are going through this. I also struggle with depression and anxiety and Ive been doing this for years so I know how exhausting it can be. 

I've recently come to the realization that people say stupid shit about others to get over or forget their own failures and insecurities. I would bet your co-workers are probably feeling the same way in terms of insecurity or anxiety or whatever.

Also, people are so self-absorbed so they might notice something one day and will completely forget it the next day. Everyone makes mistakes, your co-workers sure do. Try not to let them bother you. That is how you learn!

if you try to keep this in mind when stuff comes up, eventually you will be able to kick those annoying little negative comments aside!!

I hope this helps you!"

Just remember that everyone was in your position at one point too and in a couple of months what you are doing will become routine and comfortable. As for social aspects, just try and relax be yourself. They hired you for a reason right? And try to genuinely listen to someone when they speak. Whenever I get really nervous talking to someone I imagine I'm talking to my best friend, helps relaxes me. :) Good luck!!"

Thanks for mentioning this ""persistent depressive disorder"" didn't think this was a thing. The feeling of needing to get away is so strong for me too.

depression,f41fj2i,t1_f405j2q,1571318744.0,"Hey, 
I'm no expert in this topic but it sounds like he has has alot going on. Did something happen in the past few months that you think could have caused his shift in emotions? And if so, maybe try to put yourself in his shoes for a little while. Maybe trying to see things through his eyes could offer some perspective?...not giving him an excuse to be treating you like this but maybe it could offer some insight? 
My parents went through an extremely similar thing and they went to a counselor which really helped.
Again, I'm no expert but I guess my advice would be to just keep trying to talk to him, gently but not pushy. A simple ""hey how was your day?"" or ""anything interesting or different happen to you today?"" like phrase it in a way that allows him to open up in a different way you know?"
depression,f3ciu83,t3_dgh3e4,1570824558.0,"Hey,
I know how this feels and I'm sorry this is happening to you. I have had severe depression for more than 10 years and my fiance has a hard time dealing with it. Whenever I am feeling sad or angry or just horrible I try to give him a warning like ""I need to be alone"" or ""Im just going to go to the bedroom for a little while,"" that way when I'm at my worst, I don't take it out on him and he can process what I'm going though in his own way, seperately. When I'm feeling better, (could be hours or minutes-and that's okay!) I always, always, always let him know what happened and let him know it wasn't his fault so he doesn't put it on himself. This goes vice versa to. If he is feeling overwhelmed by you and your symptoms, he can let you know in advanced and you can let him diffuse before it becomes too much. 

Also, I can usually sense when I become too much and then i reach out and call someone! I call my mom or my friend. It's nice because they also offer different insights and perspective on things! 
Communication is key. Others love to help. I hope this helps you."
