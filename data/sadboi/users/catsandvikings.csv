DecidingToBeBetter,fqtkivm,t3_gkuq1t,1589640791.0,The good folks at r/stopdrinking can help! Hang in there!
stopdrinking,foybyot,t3_ga5zs8,1588169692.0,"You’re not alone. I’ve been drinking during this quarantine, too. It sucks donkey balls."
bulletjournal,foocs16,t1_foo8wqt,1587936685.0,Exactly!!
bulletjournal,fonudaz,t1_fonpx0i,1587926640.0,"I just try to pay attention to the time around when I’m heading to bed. So it’s not exact, but it’s pretty close. That’s why I gave up on April bc I don’t give a single shit about what time it is these days lol"
bulletjournal,fon65ci,t1_fon5fw4,1587913083.0,“Unproductive mess” feels super relatable. I’m definitely learning to give myself grace to just make it through.
bulletjournal,fon0daa,t1_fomucrl,1587909169.0,Any semblance of a schedule just does not exist. It’s rough.
bulletjournal,fon08dj,t1_fomrg1v,1587909060.0,"That’s the plan eventually but hasn’t been in the cards as of yet. Also having to do it by hand forces me to be actively aware of my schedule and habits, so it’s kind of nice."
bulletjournal,fomzvlg,t1_fomj6sy,1587908703.0,Lol mental health reset day
bulletjournal,fomztsp,t1_fomhej8,1587908665.0,Waking up in the middle of the night. If I’m up for more than 30 minutes or so I’ll document it.
bulletjournal,fomzqdw,t1_fomdwze,1587908593.0,I reached the wall of my mental health. A good ‘ol reset day.
stopdrinking,fod0wof,t1_fob5aoz,1587678474.0,"Yea, it’s not really feasible for either of us to leave at the moment."
policydebate,fo3nbqs,t3_g5ipvx,1587489771.0,An expert in the literature base that proposes or in some way advocates for your plan (or in this case CP). It can’t just be an off the wall solution you made up. You need an author who supports it.
BPD,fo3kqm7,t3_g5f6ff,1587488535.0,"One of the DBT skills that might help with this is ‘describing.’ Instead of internalizing how awful you are, try mentally describing the situation and put distance between you and your thoughts. 

For example, instead of saying to yourself, “god, I’m such a piece of shit. I’m a failure.” Try to say to yourself, “I’m having a thought that I’m a huge failure.” 

Even just putting the mental distance there to say “I’m having a thought that...” helps us to differentiate between facts and feelings. 

Hope this helps!! Hang in there!"
confession,fnx6be1,t3_g4eolq,1587332333.0,"I did the same thing. Stolen right out of my driveway bc I left the keys in the driver’s seat. Luckily I got mine back, I hope the same happens for you. 

Try not to be too hard on yourself! You’re not the only one!"
Parenting,fmsr484,t3_fx6und,1586360659.0,"Advice seems to be covered here, but I just wanted to say I relate so, so much! I have a 4 year old son and omgggg. 

I know part of it is bc his dad and I over-explain things in order to build communication and set examples of ‘using our words’ for problems, etc. but yea. A simple, 5-word sentence might go around in circles for 20+ words. I’m going nuts. You’re not a bad mom."
Conservative,fla1jq8,t1_fl92pju,1584974572.0,Maybe... it has something to do with Trump’s incompetent response to covid19?? Still seems to fit the topic.
catpictures,fjne9bu,t1_fjmd57p,1583505378.0,"Lmao no, it’s a digital thermometer"
bulletjournal,fj1b55z,t3_faajb4,1582916389.0,"When you finish one journal and move on to the next one, do you copy over the pages you still need to reference or do you have two journals for a while?"
stopdrinking,fcqvsyu,t1_fcqv10j,1577892966.0,"Thank you! Even if it’s not your one year, keep at it! I’ve been working at this since about May and I’ve reset numerous times.. it’s a process. But I’m convinced it’s worth it! 

Happy New Year to you as well and good luck!!"
getdisciplined,fb8cywk,t1_fb8279k,1576611223.0,"I don’t know of any shorter books... most everything I’ve come across is aimed at clinicians or clients completing the whole shabang. I did find some handy-looking things on Amazon, though! It’s a deck of cards with principles, tips, and exercises for both CBT and DBT. They’re called “The CBT Deck” and “The DBT Deck.” Reviews say they’re really helpful."
getdisciplined,fb7n66f,t3_ebwhmk,1576594667.0,"This is probably not exactly what you’re looking for, but Dialectal Behavior Therapy addresses these types of negative behaviors. It teaches coping skills for distress tolerance and emotional regulation. You don’t seem like you struggle with this generally, but it could definitely come in handy during those times when things seem to fall apart. There are lots of DBT resources online!"
BorderlinePDisorder,fb7lmdh,t1_fb7dxrs,1576593520.0,Well I wasn’t prepared to cry this morning but here we are. Your comment is beautifully written and so hopeful. Thank you for this encouragement. It’s too true.
curlyhair,fb45n6m,t3_eb8v91,1576502056.0,Is it just the no poo or all DevaCurl products? I use the low poo and one condition..
bulletjournal,farvsb5,t3_e9m8py,1576320626.0,Has anyone ever used bullet journaling for counseling or therapy? What kind of spreads do you recommend?
getdisciplined,fapbs0i,t3_eaa9sx,1576284980.0,"I listen to news podcasts on 1.5x. But if it’s like a narrative form, I don’t. I honestly don’t notice it anymore. I started doing it because I’m a competitive debate coach and I like to keep my ear trained to comprehend faster than average speaking, but it really is a decent tip. I don’t think I’m a sociopath lol"
stopdrinking,fak8ogr,t1_faisao3,1576162892.0,"Thank you! I feel like I didn’t do a great job describing my frustration, but this is spot on."
stopdrinking,fahn8fz,t1_fahm8dc,1576089372.0,That does make a lot more sense. Thanks for sharing.
stopdrinking,fahn5if,t3_e9afq7,1576089321.0,"To be clear, the situation in question didn’t involve AA. I only mentioned it because, from what I understand, admitting powerlessness is a tenet of AA and it’s reminiscent of what this guy was preaching. Except this was just straight religion."
curlyhair,fadsrw2,t1_facoulj,1575985228.0,I recently started using the denman brush too and I had the exact same thought!!
BPD,fabjoj0,t3_e89ofu,1575924243.0,r/stopdrinking is a wonderful community!!
BPD,fab25ai,t3_e8chmg,1575916700.0,"For sure. From what I’ve been reading, I think the key is to focus on 1 or 2 things at a time, rather than trying to get our life together all at once. I know it all needs to be fixed, but trying to do it all is setting ourselves up for failure. The momentum from feeling good about the 1 or 2 things you’re focusing on will propel you toward those other goals. 

Easier said than done, I know."
BPD,fa8i64b,t3_e80e5s,1575846797.0,"I’m reading the mindfulness chapter of DBT and it talks about this. We have Emotional Mind and Rational Mind. Extremes of either can be bad and DBT is about balancing both with Wise Mind. 

I also experience this. In times of severe distress is just... don’t feel the emotions. Like you said, though, it can put relationships in danger."
BorderlinePDisorder,fa1bsb3,t3_e7fpj2,1575767810.0,"Yep. I started lying in my late teens to deal with overly strict parents and it’s carried into my romantic relationship. I was punished whether I told the truth or not, so I started thinking, ‘why bother?’ I recently got myself into quite the dumpster fire in my marriage and I’m currently dealing with the repercussions. So yea.. it’s a problem."
BPD,f9m74uu,t1_f9ldza5,1575444330.0,"Individual differences and compatibility are important. But if that insecurity and possessiveness is routinely interfering with relationships, perhaps it’s something to examine. BPD tricks us into thinking a lot of things are “just who we are” when it’s really not. If it’s not interfering then party on."
BorderlinePDisorder,f9ez32n,t3_e4s8xw,1575255292.0,"Yep! BPD is a response to trauma and it’s totally fixable. Dialectic Behavioral Therapy was developed specifically for BPD and has great success. There are lots of folks here who know way more than I do, but I do know that part!!

Good luck!"
BPD,f8nxbzm,t3_e19ufy,1574655464.0,Please reach out to one of the folks on this sub. Your life is valuable and anything can change.
bulletjournal,f8c2pos,t3_e05m2j,1574451057.0,"I’m reading The Bullet Journal Method book right now, and it honestly seems like this is encouraged. It gives a more accurate view of what’s going on in your life at the time and what you’ve done! 

Plus, yeah. Feels good, man lol"
funny,eucaddc,t1_eubxc49,1563669501.0,"There are absolutely terrible, sexist judges and coaches who exist in the speech and debate community, but I certainly would not characterize the activity like that overall. 

Sure, high school debaters aren’t always great at critical thinking and argument flows. But that is the goal. That’s what’s taught. It’s just a challenging skill to master."
stopdrinking,etzidet,t3_ce50hk,1563332202.0,"I’ve restarted a couple times in the past 4 months, and the first 1-2 weeks are the hardest for me. Hang in there!"
Debate,erpr6hm,t1_erphuob,1561125994.0,That’s fair that’s fair. I read the post really quickly. My bad!
Debate,erp3ppk,t3_c36hxa,1561098355.0,"I will say, there are circuits (like the Midwest) where this is a norm - albeit a bit uncomfortable, but not a way a to “kiss up to the judge” ... it’s just a way to seem more civil or hospitable. Even coming from the Midwest, it makes me uncomfortable/annoyed sometimes, but it’s not always coming from a place of sucking up. 

Again, I understand the discomfort with it, but try to understand that it’s not always disingenuous.

Also, be mindful of your gendered language 😉"
curlyhair,erp0c6l,t3_c35iuz,1561094548.0,I love seeing parents on this sub! Your kiddos will never know the awful stage of hating their hair bc people don’t know how to care for it. Keep cultivating that self-love in your beautiful babe(s)!!
policydebate,era4j1b,t3_c122r7,1560635785.0,"Yes, there definitely are in the NFA-LD circuit. There may be more or less depending on your area, though."
stopdrinking,eq3ndid,t1_eq3ije6,1559759306.0,"Yea, coffee was the hardest part for me, too. Good luck!"
stopdrinking,eq3hlnb,t3_bx4g8o,1559756096.0,"I had gastritis a couple years ago. It’s awful. If you drink any soda or coffee or anything else acidic, try to eliminate that. Look up the BRAT diet and try to drink water and eat what you can. Mine cleared up completely within about a week or two."
stopdrinking,eptjrpr,t1_eo9tbmy,1559491664.0,"I kind of do! I’m a Speech & Debate coach, so I have to read a bunch of news/current events stuff, research the current debate topic, and read prose/poetry/drama for some types of speech events. It’s a great way to spend the summer... I just read what looks good and call it “work!”"
AmItheAsshole,eptirni,t3_bvwls3,1559491071.0,"NTA. Also, can I come hang out with you to talk about life lessons?"
stopdrinking,eo9wtn9,t1_eo9wdo3,1558402104.0,That’s a great idea!! Thanks!
stopdrinking,eo9pa6z,t1_eo9ogm8,1558396948.0,That’s great!! I think I’m going to join the summer reading program. I’m excited to enjoy reading again and to meet new people! I’ve lived in my current town for almost a year and haven’t met anyone outside of work.
stopdrinking,eo6hwlt,t3_bqoo5x,1558320147.0,"Sometimes your friends can surprise you. They might not know how to handle sober you, or know when it’s appropriate to invite you places. Maybe hit them up and suggest something to do that’s fun for everyone and drinking isn’t involved? 

Good luck! Hang in there!"
