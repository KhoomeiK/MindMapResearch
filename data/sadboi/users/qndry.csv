Anxiety,fqpeeyl,t3_gk7mgi,1589544186.0,"1. I think that psychologists want the client to define their worries so that the right measures can be applied. There isn't really a pre-planned method that magically works for everyone, so the therapist needs to know how to adapt their treatment appropriately to their client. I also think that she wants to get an understanding for how you feel and what sort of anxiety you have. 
2. I think she's trying to validate your feelings and also check so that she hasn't misinterpreted your thoughts. 
3. I've been doing cbt for the last couple of months and usually the first sessions are just a warm up and you later on get material and exercises to work with. I just think you need to give it time."

I really understand your situation because I've felt those feelings as well. My best tip is to not compare yourself to others, we all lead different lives and you shouldn't beat yourself down because others have been with someone. Many struggle, you just don't get to see that a lot. 

Look, highschool is over so there's no reason to dwell on it. I understand your future feels doomed, I know that feeling. But keep in mind that a lot of people don't make a sexual debut until their 20s, some their 30s. There's nothing wrong with that. One thing that has worked for me is to not chase a relationship. For me at least, those things come more naturally and smoothly when I focus on other things. Why are you worried that your future partner will be more experienced than you
