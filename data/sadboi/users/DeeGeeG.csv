Ontop of that were basically in finals and I've been too sick the past few days to even work on them, and haven't been sleeping properly. 
I'm just so tired of these miserable desperate patterns. 
If I were to go jump off the parking deck for example I wouldn't want my parents to get stuck with my student loans or motorcycle payments. 
Dammit, I've gotta ""get up"" for class in an hour and I haven't even slept yet and still feeling sick as fuck.

depression,fonaovl,t3_g88b7i,1587915798.0,"If you feel like you could have made something good out of your life, do it now. I'm 26, have dealt with MDD like 14 years or something like that, that was when I wrote my first letter apparently. Ive gotten a diagnosis and medication since then. When I got dropped out of the military that was the lowest point I had been because thats all I wanted to do all throughout high school.

Anyways, I'm definitely older than I should be for the point of life I'm at, but that's fine. I've still got another 20 years ahead of me, I feel like I probably will die in my 40s due to some stupid very unhealthy shit I've done, but thats besides the point. I'm in school now. One of the top art schools in the US as an animation major. I've swapped between Architecture to film and then to animation.

My point is, all you can do to make something good from your life is to start it. You don't have to have it all figured out right away. Some progress is better than no progress. This doesn't even have to be through school, maybe let your manager know that you would like to apply for a promotion, if they don't allow it maybe apply somewhere else. I know Publix in the US is good about helping people who want to move to management, and their store managers make bank.

Or if you're like me and feel like you've lived an unhealthy lifestyle, start to change it. I may still hardly ever eat but I have started working out at least.

Idk take what I've said here into consideration, but also with a grain of salt as I'm still often lost."

The strange thing is, from what she told me, it sounds like he wiped multiple accounts. She uses 2 banks and both are reporting negatives now.

I told her to call the banks ASAP, maybe they have some kind of insurance policy or can bounce the money back or something.

I don't think the guy has enough information on her that he could use to open any accounts.

I feel bad for her, it seems like a there is nothing she can do, I'm going to see how much information she has on this person today. Maybe can atleast report it to the police."
