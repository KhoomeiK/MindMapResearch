depression,fcnutz8,t3_ei19sk,1577818863.0,"Hey, hopefully none of you officially ended the year in financial disaster with a bankruptcy... just completes an otherwise underwhelming and pathetic life."
SuicideWatch,fc7lzc6,t3_egl00d,1577511793.0,"If you are worried about parents or others finding you, then you are not ready to die. 

Slit wrists are horribly ineffective because you'll more than likely stop before real damage(ask me how I know), Carbon poisoning may or may not work, more than likely won't... painless and effective is a firearm, but very intimidating."
depression,fc7imu1,t3_egjkeq,1577508598.0,"Wish I had some great life saving advice...somedays are better than others, but I have constantly sabotaged myself, relationships, etc. Maybe find one thing that keeps you going for another day, then another, be open to possibilities and the like. I have managed to have some good times, but joy is fleeting, still haven't found myself or any meaning. Try not to do this if you have the wherewithal, just be honest and take it one day at time, the present that is...the past is the past and ultimately pointless for the future. Starting to fray my thoughts as usual and hate to see another in pain, really sorry you have to experience this."
depression,fc7hjbr,t3_egjkeq,1577507626.0,"Been thinking about this for at least 30 years, everyday... dreadful existence really. Apparently not ready, as you are not either. All I can say is take it day by day, not saying it gets better, but you never know."
depression,fc75glm,t1_fc752a0,1577498045.0,That's not what it was meant to be.... I have been there is the point.
depression,fc6sj2n,t3_egdm43,1577488378.0,Still young... can't possibly be a failure at 25 and to what standards. Come back in 25 years.
depression,fc60z7d,t3_eg9dzt,1577469832.0,Don't sound boring at all... all good qualities in a superficial world.
depression,fc48du1,t3_efwqy4,1577409396.0,Yes... and I have given up on good karma as well.
depression,fc39svc,t3_efukvu,1577384929.0,"If the jokes are at my expense, then quite a few. Otherwise it is mostly a facade."
depression,fc1px88,t3_efhdh9,1577325999.0,"Not cringeworthy at all, very much a window into the madness."
depression,fc1a46k,t3_effx75,1577312638.0,That is where I am at... watched a couple of Netflix movies to see what feel7ng good may be like.
