I'm not really sure why age seems to make such a difference, but it does and I know that's not super helpful to you now other than knowing that there IS a light and to not give up thinking that it will never change. Keep up with your counseling and do activities that you enjoy (I've always been a big reader) and just try to avoid stressors as much as possible (easier said than done I know) and know that you are not alone in this.

I used to be repressive with my anger bc I was terrified to cause anyone to get mad at me and stop being my friend (my BPD was the super clingy, needy kind lol) so I was basically a doormat until I learned through DBT, counseling, and life in general how to express ALL of my emotions in a healthy manner.

None are just random sick folks that have been chosen to ""hate on"". There is abundant evidence contrary to their claimed diagnoses and symptoms. CFS, the illness you mention, does indeed have quite a lot of variation in severity and symptoms but the majority of subjects here do not claim CFS, but other diagnoses that gain them many more treatments, procedures and devices. Sure, every body is different and every person's illness is different, BUT the subjects here all claim to be super rare and ""the sickest of them all"" and yet their actions show otherwise. CZ, for example, uses a wheelchair during the weekdays, but then goes hiking and mountain climbing EVERY weekend. Does that not seem just the tiniest bit odd to you?

illnessfakersgonewild,fgo9jtk,t1_fgo9f03,1580963192.0,Yes that's quite likely as well. That bish will do/say anything for another surgery.
illnessfakersgonewild,fgo3ht6,t3_ezj0dl,1580958913.0,"Hmm I wonder if the DOCTOR told her she needed to go back to 2 lumens and AnaLIES is trying to make it sound as though it's her decision ü§î

We all knew she couldn't stay away from her Sicksta long. Pathetic."
illnessfakersgonewild,fgf2bny,t1_fge4kgi,1580720575.0,Right back at ya. Why do YOU care what WE think enough to comment your dislike for this sub *on every post*? Do YOU have nothing better to do than tear us down? See how this thing works both ways which makes your multiple comments ridiculously redundant??
illnessfakersgonewild,fg8bxmo,t3_ex9r7g,1580615052.0,"I'm not freaking out yet because there's just so many unknowns concerning the virus. It could become serious, but then again it might fizzle out, so until I see evidence that the former is the case then it's pretty low on my ""to worry about"" list. I'm almost 40, so I've seen a lot of ""potential pandemics"" come and go and so far the vast majority didn't end up being anywhere near as severe as what some sources had originally predicted."

candlemaking,fg3skd8,t1_fg3oisn,1580488761.0,"Yes, something like that was exactly what I was thinking of! There's a soap vendor who loves Jane Austen and each soap scent and color is based of a character or scene from the books and a very popular wax melt vendor who does lovely glitter and labels with a vintage/Victorian theme....these are just a couple good examples for a new business to look at and figure out what it is that inspires *themselves* and sets them apart from the rest."
illnessfakersgonewild,fg3r4e6,t1_fg32byc,1580487865.0,Yep! I'm always a bit suspicious of people who seem a bit too syrupy sweet because in many cases it's all just a pretty front for the ugliness that's lurking underneath.
illnessfakersgonewild,fg3qmjp,t1_fg2zdfr,1580487561.0,"These church ""mission"" trips are just a big excuse for parents to send their kids on a supervised South American vacation so that when their friends talk about their kids going to Cancun for Spring break, they can be all,""Well, MY kid is doing God's work down there while yours is getting drunk"" üòÇ Such a joke!"

cats,ffzi0j6,t1_ffpuef5,1580380147.0,How's your kitty? Doing better I hope?
illnessfakers,ffxvu8n,t1_ffxu6kh,1580333423.0,"Having a central line does NOT prove that someone is genuinely ill, as fakers have ways of faking themselves into unnecessary medical devices. Also, there's many a quack doc who's perfectly fine with performing procedures and installing devices and handing out false diagnoses for a buck. Imo, Ally probably does have some very MILD symptoms, but she highly overexaggerates and overdramatizes them to ratchet up the ""excitement"" on her account, thus receiving even more attention, sympathy and asspats. 

Posting here in an obscure, niche sub Reddit what she herself has already posted and discussing its merits (or lack thereof) or how the post is propitiating misinformation or overexaggerating an illness is hardly ""hate"". The rules of the sub state that sub members may not contact subjects in any way, so all the discussion and ""hate"" as you call it, is confined to this one place."
