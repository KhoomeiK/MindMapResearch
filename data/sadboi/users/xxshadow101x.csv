depression,ffh0ew5,t3_etk5ny,1579919765.0,Good job dude glad u feel like you had a good day. Good days can be rare sometimes so when they come around it hits different.
depression,ffas65v,t3_eskmjm,1579743239.0,"Cant help but feel this, I get you. I fail at everything I ever do and am already really self conscious so I just stoped trying anything all together. I'm not old enough to get a job yet but I feel the same thing will happen to me when I am old enough. I get the though of just never feeling like you'll amount to anything when you cant do the simplest of things correctly. I feel for you bud."

depression,fdeyhva,t3_el170m,1578349298.0,Same when ever I would say something first though although they replied eventually it was clear they didn't really want to talk and just kept the conversation short. Eventually its gotten to the point to where we never talk unless I say something and they domt even respond really anymore. It makes me feel like a fool. So yeah I feel you 100%
depression,fdd2ybt,t3_ekp8u4,1578292652.0,"Thats honestly okay, you know its bad and your trying to fix it. Slip ups are going to happen, its the way things are. Dont beat yourself up over the mistakes because you'll end up giving in and falling back into the pattern. I know what it feels like and the shame that can be felt in comming back to it. We just gotta try our best to fix it. Also sorry for whatever your going through, this might not have helped so just know that I tried. This also might not have made sense so sorry if thats the case. Hope you have a good day stranger!"

OverwatchLeague,epwxxx2,t3_bw2afv,1559587371.0,I think the best players take so much time to play all the time so having a faimly and being older would give less time to play and in this industry if that guy doesnt practice for x hours then someone else will and competition will surpass this player or even replace idk tho i am probly missing lots of things
