R6STeams,fr00d9f,t3_glvebc,1589780111.0,I’m always down to add people. I’m about 3400 mmr right now. My GT is vR wildcard
Advice,fqo05o2,t1_fqnzjmk,1589504869.0,Okay that helps a little. I wasn’t super worried about my GPA tanking but was more concerned other ways it’ll impact me. I doubt my soon to be college would reject me for it. Another thing is I don’t know how I can explain this to my mother. She is used to me getting As in almost every class but I don’t know if I could get her to understand this situation. I feel terribly guilty because I know I could have prevented this situation by just trying because it wasn’t like I COULDN’T excel but like I said I just don’t have any interest or passion for the class and it was taking its toll on me.
xboxone,fq5nfb6,t1_fq5mqp8,1589111822.0,"America. Near me it looks like target, Walmart, Best Buy, GameStop and more are out of new controllers"
xboxone,fq5lrvn,t1_fq5kjbd,1589110192.0,"Same. By the looks of other responses, it looks like I’m just going to have to order one and wait unfortunately"
xboxone,fpyf0fb,t1_fpy64km,1589002812.0,Uuuhhh no. That just sounds dumb. Why would I abuse a controller when I know I have to spend $60 for a new one? That just doesn’t make sense.
xboxone,fpyekkl,t1_fpxw92h,1589002545.0,Exactly I don’t think most people understand how Xbox controllers aren’t all made equally or are very high quality. I don’t abuse my controllers because I have to spend $60 on them already
xboxone,fpyecym,t1_fpxt4pc,1589002423.0,It’s definitely not that. I do play quite a bit but I don’t think they should wear out as fast some of them have. A couple have been great but my latest one for example has already shown signs of giving out and it hasn’t been two months. I don’t rage throw or anything and I set them on the charger when I’m done.
xboxone,fpxslip,t1_fpxs10p,1588988735.0,I know I don’t understand. They are so inconsistent. I’ve had controllers last a long time and a couple that barely last led a couple months because they were messed up coming out of the box. I do play competitive games a lot more than the average person though. I play siege and rocket league where youre always on your analog sticks but it is frustrating how quickly I find myself having to raise my dead zones
xboxone,fpxsbjh,t1_fpxrvh3,1588988572.0,"I do play quite a bit but it’s so hit or miss with these controllers. I had 1 that lasted about 2 years, then I had 2 that lasted about a year each. I had two others that just didn’t last long at all. Like they came out of the box already messed up. I know they make them cheap and not very high quality but dang it’s frustrating having to spend $60 on a controller."
Rainbow6,fpuorrm,t1_fpuooih,1588918834.0,I just don’t understand how it’s fun making an account dedicated to just destroying lower ranks. IMO these smurfs have such fragile egos
Rainbow6,fpuoon7,t1_fpunp1c,1588918760.0,"I play console and it frustrating how every round I encounter a smurf, mnk user or both. I love the game and concept but it can be sooo hard to actually enjoy when you aren’t actually playing a fair match. I want to play people my level and improve.  I feel like there are so many things out of my control most matches. A good mnk user will beat me who has a controller most fights. It is hard to kill a guy on smurf who’s smurf account is the rank of my main account. It’s going to be tough killing a guy when I have a 1/5th of his play time. I can say I would like this game so much more if I didn’t have to put up with this every match."
Rainbow6,fpuobyy,t1_fpuo5dn,1588918464.0,I guess you are correct about DDoS attacks are platform issues but it’s so dumb that someone would talk trash right before ddosing me out of a lobby. That just shows how low this community can get.
Rainbow6,fptnwao,t1_fptma5g,1588894800.0,"Same man, rocket league is my main game too. I feel as if almost every game is competitive and winnable. Smurfs aren’t nearly as bad, at least in my rank. You don’t have to worry about a smurf with a fragile ego using mnk either. I know it’s not an advantage in rocket league but for siege it definitely is. In rocket league I feel and see my progress while in siege it can be so hard because I’m not even playing people my rank more often than not. How am I going to improve by getting destroyed by a smurf every round. Yeah I can see what they’re doing but I’m not going to develop their aim overnight or have the same knowledge as them when I have 1/5th of their play time. I like the game and concept and wish I could enjoy it more but it is demoralizing at times."
SiegeAcademy,fppisra,t1_fppfn9m,1588803050.0,"Not necessarily. I just feel like I could be doing a bit more. It’s tough because we have kind of a weird team composition. We have our top two players who are pretty knowledgeable about the game and are normally our top two fraggers almost every single round. Then there’s me who is still learning quite a bit. I’m solid with my aim, not crazy but I can get the job done. Like I said though I’m either support or flank watch in nearly every round which is fine with me because I like a lot of those ops like thermite, thatcher, hibana and nomad. I’m definitely our third best each round. Then we have the 2 bottom guys on our team. One guy has about the same time played as me but just kind of struggles. He isn’t the best overall as he can’t get many kills and his game sense lacks big time but he’s our friend so obviously we play with him and try to help. Our 5th is also not the greatest. He’s super inconsistent. His game sense is also kind of lacking but he has solid gun skill. Just depends on the round. Today he went 1 and 8 one match and then two matches later he went like 12 and 6. So definitely can shoot but struggles with siege knowledge at times. Just figured I’d give you some insight to what our team is like and why I want to be better. All of us are friends in real life and 5 stack pretty consistently which is nice."
depression,fpku8hw,t1_fpjzscs,1588701123.0,All I can say is ouch because it sounds like we are in very similar situations lol.
SiegeAcademy,fpc3bbt,t3_gcjg12,1588486246.0,Yeah I kind of stopped solo queuing ranked for this reason. I normally have a 5 stack but I’d solo queue once in a while when they weren’t on. My favorite experience is having an off match in ranked and then receive personal messages from my team mate(s) telling me how bad I am lol.
gaming,fp8esof,t1_fp8engg,1588390490.0,Looks like I’m about to make the purchase. Have like 4 people saying to get it 2 minutes after this post lol.
gaming,fp8ens3,t1_fp8eiib,1588390393.0,Alright thanks for the input! How did you think the gameplay and mechanics were?
RocketLeague,fp4mxzw,t1_fp4gsuw,1588302582.0,"I’ll definitely try to use some of those tips more, thanks!"
Rainbow6,fp3mq35,t1_fp2as7b,1588282036.0,I get that playing better players can make you better and teach you things but in reality I shouldn’t be in the same lobby as some of these players. I am though because they are on a smurf account and that’s what is frustrating. It wouldn’t be so bad if it was occasionally but I can say it happens in 99% of ranked matches. Sure we win some against smurfs but some are just so good that it makes it tough to even compete. I don’t know I just wish that I could go against 5 people of my rank for most matches but that isn’t going to happen. Not trying to be rude but I don’t think someone should be expected not to play ranked if they don’t want to play smurfs. I don’t know what kind of logic that is to be honest.
Rainbow6,fp3m6ff,t1_fp1mvqv,1588281759.0,I totally get what youre saying and I understand that it won’t go away. The may thing for me is that I enjoy trying to get better and rank up. I like the game overall. I just don’t like playing smurfs who are clearly leagues ahead of me. It’s frustrating feeling like smurfs are impeding the progress I’m trying to make. I hope this kind of makes sense because I don’t know if I explained it too well.
Rainbow6,fp3lxfa,t1_fp1nu94,1588281631.0,I don’t think you quite understand. I’m not upset at MY skill level. I’m upset I’m playing someone who’s NOT my skill level. Someone who I should never be in the same lobby with but they have a smurf account to just destroy lower ranks. I like to play and get better but how is it fair at all that I’m trying to play and get better in a what should be a Gold 1 to Plat 3 lobby but then I get matched up with a smurf who’s actually plat 1 or something.
Rainbow6,fp3lkzg,t1_fp1ozhg,1588281452.0,Yes it isn’t as common as smurfing but it definitely happens and it’s kind of annoying but it isn’t the worst problem right now.
xboxone,foxejm7,t1_foxe2gd,1588141591.0,Just chilling on the same table my xbox was on
xboxone,foxei9h,t1_foxd8b7,1588141559.0,No it was just on a table for most of the time. I don’t use my controllers when I’m eating or drinking anything.
Blackops4,fooxmoi,t1_foor9mk,1587948628.0,Micromg
Blackops4,fooxlfe,t1_foor48f,1587948606.0,"I don’t play a lot of zombies myself so I couldn’t tell ya, sorry."
Blackops4,fooq8ro,t1_fooofvb,1587944165.0,It’s called the micromg. It’s a dlc weapon that you have to earn 50 reserve crates to get.
RocketLeague,fonvvta,t3_g8joah,1587927495.0,I feel like you might have a bit better luck at r/rocketleaguefriends. Good luck finding some team mates!
Blackops4,fonvp1b,t1_fonvc0d,1587927389.0,That’s insane
Blackops4,fonvlby,t1_fonvj4t,1587927331.0,Only for this weapon. I’m not sure what that’s all about tbh
Blackops4,fonv3mq,t1_fonuu33,1587927048.0,They created a bunch of dlc weapons with a few being head and shoulders above the rest.
Blackops4,fonui9t,t1_fonbip8,1587926716.0,"Thanks man! I don’t get why some people still seem to take this so seriously or too much to heart. I just play the game casually for fun because I have a few friends who hop on the game. I just play with them and try to rack up the kills. I grinded 50 reserve crates so yeah, I’m going to use the weapon I unlocked on maps that go well with it."
Blackops4,fontx6d,t1_fonm63p,1587926389.0,Exactly. I’ve been able to get 2-3 weapons for free by getting reserve crates.
Blackops4,fontrwq,t1_fontmi7,1587926307.0,Lol
Blackops4,fonto0w,t1_fonck91,1587926247.0,It’s a pretty broken gun. Absolutely lethal close range but isn’t viable at longer ranges. This might only make you more mad lol but I was only using laser sight I here.
Blackops4,fontb4e,t1_fongxew,1587926047.0,It’s not one of my main games by any means. One of my friends has it and it’s really the only game he’ll play aside from Minecraft. I only play when he’s on. I don’t think it’s be worth the reinstall.
Blackops4,fon6m5o,t1_fon4oju,1587913368.0,Nah only to get one in 4 seconds
Advice,fomnl5h,t1_fomnaai,1587896919.0,That’s great! I know I might sound like I’m complaining I’m this post but I don’t take it for granted. I’ve been doing it for a year and I’ve learned a lot as well throughout my time at the store. I just think it’s time to move on for me.
Advice,fomn6c1,t1_fommgm9,1587896450.0,"Thanks for the advice! To clarify though, I have a second job that is very part time. I just fill in as needed for now as I work 20-25 hours a week at the retail store. I’m also a high school student. I guess what I was saying is that I might just quit a week earlier than planned because I can take on more hours at my second job which was going to become my full time job this summer if all that makes sense. To fill the gap I’ll be able to focus on school as well."
Advice,fommciq,t1_fomltw3,1587895507.0,"I definitely understand the importance. I do every job to the best of my ability, but as you mentioned is your response, I just don’t feel like this is something I signed up for. I know everyone is just trying to make the best of the situation but even my old tasks felt repetitive and boring. I feel like I’m on auto pilot my whole shift. At least with my normal tasks I still keep pretty busy which helps the time pass but doing the same thing over and over is just not it for me. Also we aren’t allowed to listen to my music which is unfortunate but understandable since you want to look approachable at your job. I think I’ll just have to make the best of it. I was planning on putting in my two weeks right at the beginning of May anyways but now that this was just dumped on us I feel like I’ll just do it here in the next day or two and call it quits about a week earlier than I planned. I have an opportunity at another job anyways soon that was already lined up which is cool and a little more suited to my strengths and personality."
Blackops4,fomki92,t1_fomkbhx,1587893452.0,I’m sorry I know it’s wrong. I just use certain guns for certain maps. Since it’s hard point and such close quarters that’s my go to for Morocco.
RocketLeague,fomjfnp,t3_g8aphg,1587892282.0,Oddly enough someone actually was a nice opponent today and told me I had a nice bump on him that led to us scoring. Was kind of surprised lol
RocketLeague,fomjbwx,t3_g8aycq,1587892171.0,I was one of them lol. Time for bed though
xboxone,fnvi9gx,t1_fnvhxgq,1587294328.0,"I haven’t contacted Xbox support yet. I’ve just been looking through some of their possible solutions but nothing has worked. I’ve tried hard resetting, clearing saved games, uninstalling and reinstalling games, removing my profile and adding it again. Thanks for the info though. You’re right I might just have to contact Microsoft or have it serviced but I’m trying to avoid that at this point. The next console comes out in several months but I might even switch to PC anyway."
xboxone,fnvhkqq,t3_g41vba,1587293597.0,I have no idea what your budget is or anything but I’ll let you know what I’ve liked. I got myself a 43” TCL Roku 4K UHD HDR Smart TV (43s425) for $230. I’m just a high school senior so I went for a budget buy and I feel it’s given me the most bang for my buck. I play a quite a bit of Xbox myself and watch some movies. I probably game more than I watch but what I have has been great for both in my opinion. If you have more money to spend than I did though I’m sure you could find something better.
R6STeams,fnqe3nh,t1_fnq0pl4,1587162805.0,For sure will do if we have a spot later
RocketLeagueFriends,fnpx2ga,t1_fnpwv7h,1587153564.0,Oh just send me your rocketID. Maybe we could just use discord if you have it?
RocketLeagueFriends,fnpwl9z,t1_fnpwbua,1587153321.0,I have a mic for my xbox but I also have discord if you would rather do that. Whatever you prefer
R6STeams,fnpvsxj,t1_fnov4lt,1587152913.0,Alright cool. I’ll add you and if you’re on when we get on I can just toss you an invite
RocketLeagueFriends,fnpvp0t,t1_fnobyxu,1587152856.0,What’s your GT?
RocketLeagueFriends,fnpvnnu,t1_fnobyxu,1587152837.0,I’m on Xbox. I’ll be on tonight and quite a bit this weekend.
R6STeams,fno6tgv,t1_fno6jaz,1587114248.0,Sure what’s your GT? I could hit you up when we get on tomorrow if you’re also on. Or just whenever
RocketLeagueFriends,fno6qnc,t1_fnn0381,1587114159.0,I’m not a great 1s player by any means but if you’d like some help I’d be down. I’m Plat 3 in 1s and Champ 2 in 3s
R6STeams,fno5x3r,t3_g2wlra,1587113276.0,I have a few friends. We are all high school seniors if that matters. Sometimes their is already 5 of us but most nights it’s only 3-4 of us. We have Plat 3s and people in gold. Let me know if you’re interested

SiegeAcademy,fnarlr9,t1_fn9f24s,1586802590.0,Okay thanks man! I’ll be sure to check that out
buildapc,fmzs270,t1_fmz6nls,1586528354.0,I was looking at potentially pairing this CPU and GPU because from what I’ve read it looks like it is more for budget graphics. Unless there is a larger problem you can expand on that’s wrong with this pairing that I’m missing. Also is their a mouse you would recommend?
buildapc,fmz52xt,t1_fmz2f4e,1586506712.0,"Will do, appreciate the advice!"
buildapc,fmz0uqn,t1_fmyzix6,1586502215.0,Oh yeah I was already thinking about the hard drive part because that’s easier and figured I didn’t need to include that here but thanks! The size of memory is 16gb DDR4
buildapc,fmwnfia,t1_fmvs8f6,1586449695.0,Oh wow thanks for that! So that site will even let you know if all the parts you have are compatible? I might have to play around with that a bit
buildapc,fmvqvxq,t1_fmvqd2i,1586427424.0,Thanks for that advice as well. So what you are saying is that it is easier to upgrade your own build in the future than it is to upgrade a prebuilt?
buildapc,fmvqt8r,t1_fmvpwho,1586427338.0,Wow! Thanks for the info and tips. I’m glad you pointed that out about prebuilts and not making the building sound overwhelming. That’s the biggest thing for me is not regretting my decision. This is all new to me and I would like to make it a good experience to see if I want to permanently move on from console.
buildapc,fmvqmvv,t1_fmvpksi,1586427139.0,"I would probably say that a budget of 900  for everything for the actual PC. I would give myself about 200 for a solid monitor and then obviously I’d need to get a mouse, keyboard and windows. So between all of that I’d say $1300 for everything that’s going into my setup."
xboxone,fmvpg90,t1_fmvp6jn,1586425796.0,Thanks for the advice! I’ll definitely give that a shot
xboxone,fmv1icb,t1_fmuzwe1,1586403770.0,When I do that it says “too to long to to open storage management” every time like with my other games and apps
xboxone,fmuzqdo,t1_fmuzcq5,1586402573.0,Dumb question but how would I reformat it?
xboxone,fmuwd40,t1_fmuvn7e,1586400356.0,Sorry for the confusion. I know where settings is. It just doesn’t let me even go into settings when my external drive is in. It says took too long to start over and over. When I unplug the external hard drive I can get into settings. Also forgive me for being blind but I managed to get into settings but I don’t see where to configure the hard drive. It wasn’t in the devices section. Should I try going into >system>storage?

xboxone,fmuvmvy,t1_fmuuxqu,1586399893.0,Forgot to add this but does your advice still stand if I already have games downloaded onto it? My games are already on there but nothing works
xboxone,fmuvjtm,t1_fmuuxqu,1586399838.0,Thanks for the advice. I’ll give it a try and see if it works. Might be difficult to get into settings but I’ll try it
RocketLeagueCoaching,fmkjsbd,t3_ftbmas,1586157376.0,I don’t know if you’ll see this now but if I could get the opportunity to learn a thing or two from you that’d be awesome! I’m an 18 year old rocket league player myself currently in Champ 2. I’ve been really getting into the game these past 6ish months and am passionate about improving and one day hitting GC!
RocketLeague,fmdy3xx,t1_fmdv2p9,1585981882.0,I feel like a carried one tbh. I’m trying to figure out what my next step is rn. I have a lot to work on but idk how to approach it in training. I KNOW I can be better but idk how to go about it. I just want someone to tell me how they do it.
RocketLeague,fmdxynk,t1_fmdv3li,1585981729.0,Thanks but this truly isn’t some type of humble brag. I just haven’t been improving like I was before. Idk what to do next or what to work on I guess. I do know how to maximize my training to get the most out of it. I hate being stuck where I’m at. It’s literally been driving me crazy. I’m hardly moving a division ever. I also feel carried. I offer next to nothing on the offensive end
RocketLeague,fmdxtnd,t1_fmdv96e,1585981584.0,Mechanical. I’m just terrible. My game has just felt like it’s been lacking heavily. I’m pretty confident in my defense but as a striker and consistency on my shots or touches I’m pretty horrendous. My car control is weak. My recoveries are bad. I’m just stuck at low champ 2. I want to be better but idk what the next step is. For each rank before it was clear what I needed to do but now idk. I’ve tried working on backboard shots but I’m hopeless. My game is rough and not at all smooth. Idk in conclusion I’m stuck and lost
RocketLeague,fm6d7p3,t1_fm6b9tk,1585791482.0,I wish! Unfortunately I’m on Xbox although I do wish I could take advantage of that
RocketLeagueFriends,fm055by,t3_fs6fjq,1585645106.0,I would really like to. I’m on Xbox though if it matters. Im a champ 2 rn but was mainly champ 3 last season and hit Gc a time or two
RocketLeague,flqccb2,t3_fqgzos,1585388593.0,Idk man when has this started for you? It feels like it’s been happening a lot to me recently. Things like backflipping or not dodging. I don’t know but something has seemed off to me too so I don’t think your alone
xboxone,flow5ot,t1_flmpdi7,1585346714.0,Sorry if this is a dumb question but how do you format an external drive
xboxone,flmn5vb,t1_flmmbny,1585288957.0,Just saw my awful grammar lol. I’m actually thinking you may be right... I just tried playing a game on my internal hard drive with my external hard drive disconnected and those few games all worked just fine. What would you suggest I do next then?
xboxone,flmmy9y,t1_flmmtoo,1585288740.0,I’m sorry but I’ve tried numerous times and it didn’t help
xboxone,flmkuqi,t1_flmhpzt,1585286706.0,Like 13 but they I have an external hard drive
xboxone,flmkte9,t1_flmife7,1585286671.0,"You are totally right! That’s what is happening to me and then they’d play. Now though when I unplug and then plug back in it’ll say “External hard drive ready” or whatever and all my games pop up but when I click on them they either don’t go into the game at all or it’ll go to the first screen when you load up and then sit there for a few minutes and then it’ll tell me it took too long to start. It does this with everything though. Games, apps and even settings."
xboxone,flm8cfp,t1_flm5uko,1585276994.0,I’ve tried so many times lol. I don’t know what to do
xboxone,flm8bgk,t1_flm4wfj,1585276976.0,I hit reset console in system settings and chose the option to reset but keep games and apps. Don’t know if that is the same as you’re talking about or not.
xboxone,fl2ndly,t3_fm748t,1584755162.0,Same problem here but no idea what’s wrong
xboxinsiders,fkfl3o1,t1_fkfjwu8,1584136809.0,Yessir I have. I’ve tried doing that and clearing local saved games. I’ve done just a basic restart. I don’t know man. I am trying one more thing right now though. I unplugged literally everything and restarting my WiFi as well. I just don’t know what to do. I just hope it’s not giving out on me. I’ve probably had it for about 5-6 years. It’s just been acting weird in general lately. Been trying to make it to fall when the next Gen comes out
xboxone,fkdcbyi,t3_fhu0ql,1584074071.0,I mean I could definitely use a new game lol. On a more serious note gl to everyone
RocketLeagueExchange,fjokf2r,t1_fjok9yx,1583529534.0,Oh ok thanks for the advice. I’ll revise it. I was just going off the website
RocketLeagueExchange,fjdjr8t,t1_fjdjexh,1583253975.0,Wait what how could you tell?
RocketLeague,fjaoslc,t1_fja4o6a,1583177698.0,"Thanks man, will do!"
RocketLeague,fj99yrd,t1_fj99j40,1583138661.0,"Thanks, what you pointed out makes sense and has been something I’ve been trying to work on. I feel like it ties into my recoveries a little bit too because I’m not the greatest sometimes and probably use more boost getting back than I need to. I’ve been practicing recovery mechanics though. I also have a question about positioning though if you could maybe help me out. What I have trouble with is sometimes I feel like I’ll get caught lurking  in mid field too often and will spend a lot of time driving back and forth in the middle of the field but not actually getting a chance to strike or go on offense on the opponents side. I don’t feel as if I get a lot of striking opportunities. I don’t know if it’s a trust thing where I don’t always think my team mates will rotate behind me or what. I’ve been making a point to focus more on where my team mates are more often too which helps. I hope what I said makes sense. I’m just normally a more defensive player and I don’t get too aggressive usually."
