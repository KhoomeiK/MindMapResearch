careerguidance,fqngex2,t3_gjvbs0,1589494386.0,"I’ve been in your situation twice. It definitely depends on your industry and experience level. 

The first time, I started applying two weeks before my move. That meant phone interviews usually right as I was moving and interviews as I was settling in/unpacking. I personally preferred the gap. 

The second time I moved, I ended up starting my new job the day after moving into my new apartment and experienced major burnout. It was rough to adjust to. 

I’d suggest you prepare yourself for a slight resume gap. There’s no harm in applying early, but know that some places may discount your application after learning you can’t start for four weeks (even though let’s face it, the application process is usually a slow one)."

women_in_recovery,fq9szrr,t3_ghhlwt,1589206429.0,"Congratulations on six days! I’d also recommend you try some online/zoom meetings, especially ones geared toward beginners because they often provide an opportunity for newer folks to share or get phone numbers. Talking to other people who know what you’re going through is invaluable — just like you’re doing now by writing this post. 

Another good thing about online meetings is you might be able to find an interim sponsor. Someone who’s been though it before and can offer suggestions, someone who has the kind of sober life you want for yourself. As addicts we don’t always have the best instincts; and having someone else with experience can be very helpful. 

If you can, ordering literature online is great too. There’s a very short beginners book called Living Sober that offers very helpful tips. If money is an issue and you’re located in the US, DM me your address and I can send you one. 

You’re doing amazingly well. Reaching out for help, asking for suggestions, and getting sober in the middle of a very strange time. Remember: “one day (or sometimes one hour) at a time” is a slogan for a reason! Please keep posting here and keep us updated!"

Keep traveling. If you love the travel aspect of your job, do as much traveling as you can with your vacation time. 

Find a mentee/mentor. In the office or outside of it, work on continuing ed as well.
