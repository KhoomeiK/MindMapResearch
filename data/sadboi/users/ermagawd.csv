MichaelJackson,fr3t2qs,t1_fr3rdnq,1589865497.0,"Yeah plus he had no idea he was being recorded so he's really speaking from the heart. I agree about it being a critical mistake, and I believe he really was quite naive and emotionally stunted due to being a childhood star. You hear all those other kids that stayed at Neverland saying that it was always like a big slumber party with movies and candy and stuff. Is it weird that a grown man was throwing slumber parties? Definitely. But at the same time I find it hard to believe that anything sinister happened because of how stunted Michael was, I think he truly just wanted to pretend like he was a kid while at home (hence the name Neverland). I think people who steadfastly believe he is guilty just can't see it from a different perspective, it's black and white to them that if someone hangs out with kids, they aren't normal and therefore must be abusive to those kids."
MichaelJackson,fr3qg1i,t1_fr3pqw3,1589863505.0,"Yeah that is REALLY hard to listen to, but holy shit the last part of that recording sums up everything about why Michael was the way he was. That he loves them because he didn't have a childhood and he feels their pain. Damn that's fucking heartbreaking. I wish more people knew about this recording. Like he was saying this shit from the heart, when you're doped up like that you have no filter."
MichaelJackson,fr3q5ti,t3_gme9hi,1589863297.0,I'll never get over how much he looks like Michael.
MichaelJackson,fr3oojy,t1_fr25qy8,1589862230.0,"Yeah that whole thing with Prince was fucked up, like he was so young and really really didn't need to be up there. I also never heard the recording that Conrad took of Michael talking about how he was going to use the money from the shows to build a children's hospital. Hearing how out of it he was really broke my heart. Such a tragic death."
MichaelJackson,fr2xhcs,t1_fr2t35s,1589845796.0,"Yup, they are totally grasping at straws. They try to make literally everything he ever did into some weird pervy thing. It's honestly pathetic"
MichaelJackson,fr1uidd,t1_fr0yyzg,1589826170.0,"I think it was well done, it lined up with everything I have read surrounding his death and they seemed to just be reporting the facts, not throwing their own opinions in too much, although I gotta say I really don't like Diane Diamond lol.

Definitely read some books! My favourites were Michael Jackson: The Magic, The Madness, The Whole Story by Randy Taraborrelli. It was the first book I read about Michael and it basically goes through his entire life  since Randy was close with the family since day 1. I found it really unbiased, well-researched, and so well-written. It was the book that made me see MJ in a different light. Another one would be Untouchable by Randall Sullivan. Also My Friend Michael by Frank Cascio provided really interesting insight to Michael's behaviour and how he craved a normal family life more than anything. I agree that the Arvizo case was incredibly suspect, they shouldn't have even taken it to trial since there were so many holes in their story and credibility. 
Yeah Conrad Murray is hella suspicious, like that doc said MJ was worth more dead than alive so the entire circumstance leading up to his death feel really fishy to me. Conrad didn't act like a doctor should have and his behaviour after his death (like sneaking out of the hospital and avoiding police questioning) was soooooooo unprofessional. It makes me really sad, especially for MJ's kids."
MichaelJackson,fr1sijb,t1_fr0uw37,1589825185.0,>Have you looked at the Leaving Neverland HBO subreddit lately? It's actually insane how hard they grasp at straws to make him look guilty. I checked yesterday for the first time in a while and there's a picture of a baby magazine that michael had signed and they are twisting it to make it seem nefarious in some way. It's fucked.

MichaelJackson,fqzz5tm,t1_fqz1uh1,1589779157.0,"Ah I just started watching that doc you recommended and it's HARD. The first few minutes are already making me sad lol they are so right that the world stopped on the day that he died. I remember precisely where I was at the time I heard it (my friend's mom was driving us home from an outdoor pool) and it made all of us in the car collectively gasp even though none of us were even fans.

Have you read The Michael Jackson Conspiracy by Aphrodite Jones? She was a reporter that covered the Arvizo trial and she was allllllll for guilty verdict until the end of the trial and she realized how fucked her and her colleagues were for only reporting the little tidbits in court that made him seem guilty. She wrote the book in hopes to bring to light the media bias against him. I'd recommend it for sure.

 I agree in that he had good intentions, he just was not good at showing his care and generosity in a 'socially acceptable' way. I think he had a really hard time trusting people seeing as a lot of people in his life just wanted his money, so who knows if he really even considered getting help as a viable thing since he probably wouldn't trust the people helping him. I think that's why he  found it easier to be around kids, because they were innocent and liked him for him, they didn't see him as the superstar, and they didn't want money from him. 
I'm glad he had such strong support from his fans the whole way through everything, he clearly cared a lot for them, although I can't really think of him dying because the fact that he was so very alone in that moment is heartbreaking. I'm stoked to finish the documentary though."
MichaelJackson,fqyxexv,t1_fqyajtw,1589756210.0,"Thanks! I will definitely give it a watch later. I'm always interested to learn more about the circumstances around his death. 
Yeah that was basically me as well, there is SO much information out there it's hard to sort through it and piece it all together while making sure it's all from good sources and stuff. I've totally been there lol I mean it's been over a year and I'm still reading as much as I can on him, it's crazy how much information there is. 
I think over the years more stuff may come out that will help create a clearer picture, like Taj Jackson's documentary and others. I get that he did show signs of grooming but at the same time, I also think that he was just a generous person, I mean looking at all the footage of him at children's hospitals and stuff it really did seem like he wanted to make people/kids happy. There is an innocence/naivety about him that comes through in all the books I've read, interviews, and footage and from people that knew him as well. I would love to know one way or another as well. My heart honestly hurts for him if he truly was innocent though."
MichaelJackson,fqy65kx,t1_fqy4d3o,1589743245.0,"Yeah that's fair. I really do wish people knew more about his history before judging him on the drug stuff. What really kills me is that he was so opposed to doing the Pepsi commercial but his family guilted him into it. He didn't believe in the company and didn't want to support it. Plus the fact that he was always vehemently opposed to painkillers due to his spiritual beliefs. His life was just a series of tragic events. And the whole Conrad Murray thong still fucks with my head. Like he performed cpr on michael on his bed. I am no doctor but even I know that Cpr needs to be performed on a hard surface. Plus with how long it took Murray to call 911. The whole thing feels sketchy to me lol.
Yeah I get that. To be fair I was 11 when the Gavin trial happened and since I was so young I just believed what the media was saying and up until watching LN last year I was firmly in the camp that Michael was a creepy pedo. After watching LN I felt like it was very....contrived and that's when I fell down the MJ rabbit hole and my views of him totally changed. I agree that he made some really dumb choices especially having kids over after the first accusations. But at the same time I try to look at it with the context of his whole life. He lived in a tiny house with a bunch of siblings, to him sharing a bed with people was super normal. Plus his bedroom at Neverland was like 2000 square feet and he usually slept on the floor. Does it make me feel icky? For sure but I also think he had a Peter pan syndrome and since he was never really exposed to what society sees as 'normal' behaviour for an adult man, he didn't see what he was doing as a creepy thing. Plus I also read that he had a huge defiant streak because of his father. Idk I've been back and forth on it so many times but I just don't see him being guilty after doing all the reading about him."
MichaelJackson,fqy2wh7,t1_fqy18uf,1589741715.0,"Yeah it's tragic because I think he would still be alive if he hadn't agreed to do those shows. He seemed to be so financially savvy when he purchased the Sony ATV catalogue but I think his wealth was just too much to keep track of and he also donated so much of it. Didn't help he was constantly being sued because people knew they would get a settlement. I don't think he was perfect either, and I think a lot of people in this sub would agree as well. I believe his childhood really fucked him up and it ruined the way he was able to connect with people as an adult. I just hate the way the media treated him his whole life, I think he was very misunderstood and I do think he was innocent."
MichaelJackson,fqy0fzf,t1_fqxylpr,1589740608.0,Yeah his finances were an absolute mess. I think they brought in a ton of accountants to sort it out but it was near impossible. It seemed everyone wanted a slice of the MJ fortune pie. Ugh yeah I can't even go to that subreddit anymore to argue it's so frustrating. They will always put their emotions and feelings before the facts
MichaelJackson,fqxxt34,t1_fqxx4tc,1589739479.0,"Yeah it's kinda hard to follow but knowing how Michael was, he didn't really deal with his finances right? I think he just wanted the whole thing over and done with at that point and his lawyers encouraged it, plus there was that whole thing about Evan pushing for the civil lawsuit to be pushed ahead before the criminal one was finished. Which ended up becoming illegal in cali because of that situation."
MichaelJackson,fqxxa0v,t3_glghox,1589739254.0,"I love that none of the comments I found about MJ are negative. They're all like 'Who WOULDN'T dance to 'Rock With You?""

Looooove it."
MichaelJackson,fqxwimu,t1_fqxvl3u,1589738931.0,"I know, although I recall reading that it wasn't actually Michael's decision, it was the insurance company that kinda forced his hand because if they had let it go to trial it would've been really expensive and time-consuming. Anytime the Jordy thing is brought up people are like why would an innocent man pay them off?!? Like I get how guilty it makes him look but understanding the context is important too but most people aren't going to look into it like that. Jordy's life was absolutely ruined by his dad. Collateral damage of an insecure dad for sure."
MichaelJackson,fqxuy34,t1_fqxsoym,1589738274.0,"Yeah you could always kinda tell how his mental state was by how thin he was. In 2009 he looked absolutely skeletal, it broke my heart."
MichaelJackson,fqxuubd,t1_fqxsn0b,1589738224.0,"Yeah I have read those. Honestly from all the reading I've done, it's always seemed to me that Evan was a shitty dad, then when he realized that Michael, June, and Jordy were becoming like a family, he panicked and was really upset that he felt like Jordy had another dad in Michael. I mean he even said in the transcripts that he didn't think Michael was harming Jordy sexually. I think he was mostly angry at June. The whole situation was totally fucked up. Evan was completely messed up and I think that's underlined by the fact that he killed himself shortly after Michael's death."

GERD,fqtso4j,t1_fqt4zfu,1589645335.0,"Agreed. I've had it since I was 21, and my doctor thinks it was due to Advil use for migraines over the years damaging my stomach.

If people were guaranteed to die younger we would be seeing a HUGE amount of younger people dying from stomach and esophagous cancers, since GERD is quite common."

GERD,fow1zxk,t1_fou6lds,1588111544.0,"Completely agree. I had this conversation with my doctor as I have been on Pantoprazole for 2 years now, and have tried weaning off only to have horrible gastritis and GERD. At this point, I would rather risk the side effects of long-term use (and take my magnesium and B12 lol) than suffer, and have higher risk of esophageal/stomach cancer."
