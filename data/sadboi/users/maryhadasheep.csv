Everyone’s body & brain are different and everyone is going have a completely different reaction to THC. I find for me (rapid cycling bipolar 1) it helps tremendously, as long as I’m stable on my medications and being monitored by a doctor. I use it to help with my PTSD, anxiety & depression. It does wonders for my insomnia episodes as well."

DiagnoseMe,fqjit7g,t3_gj9nnm,1589410540.0,"My mom-mom (79F) has had this spot on her leg for ~6 weeks. Was treated as cellulitis/hematoma with five days of oral antibiotics (amoxicillin) through last week. The hematoma burst open overnight late last week and my mom has been cleaning it daily with peroxide and warm water and covering with a bandage. 

I used to be an LPN and have experience in geriatric wound care & had a chance to go over today & look at it and that’s when I snapped this picture. I uncovered the wound + proceeded to clean and irrigate with normal saline. I noted dried bloody & yellow drainage, and the wound was only slightly draining (bloody/yellow) while I cleaned it. I pat the area dry with gauze pads & left open to air, and told my mom to irrigate & clean again with normal saline before bed & cover with a bandage just at bedtime. 

We’re going to be calling her doctor tomorrow morning to get her in hopefully tomorrow. I guess my question is, am I overreacting? I think it looks absolutely awful & I imagine they’ll order wound care nursing to come in and care for it. I’m just looking for other opinions. Thanks all! Let me know if I can provide anymore information.

History on my grandmother: 79 year old female with history of COPD, A. Fib, arthritis. Currently taking multiple medications including Coumadin as a blood thinner.

EDIT: Just got off the phone with her PCP, he said to get her to the ER ASAP. Just waiting to hear from my mom & I’ll be meeting them at the hospital. Thank you all for helping me advocate for my mom-mom! Making me feel like a real nurse again :’)

EDIT 2: So I probably should’ve mentioned she isn’t running a fever and there are no swollen lymph nodes, and the wound/leg isn’t hot, which are all really great signs.

EDIT 3: We are getting ready to leave the ER now— doctor prescribed another round of antibiotics (doxycycline this time) by mouth x10 days. He assessed the wound for an abscess & attempted to express trapped air/pus and was happy to not find anything. The doctor dressed the wound with a petrolatum dressing, gauze & an ace bandage to help keep it breathable with orders to change the dressing twice daily. He wants us to follow up with her PCP tomorrow to get a consult for wound care."

Some advice I’d give to a new pug owner.. get a harness for walks, don’t even bother with a collar. Get him microchipped & consider pet insurance or a care credit card for vet bills, expected + unexpected. Pugs are very prone to heat related injuries, so try to be aware of the weather and plan your days and activities accordingly (especially in the summer) if you’re including the pug. Pugs are seriously the best dogs in the whole world, give them some time and attention and they will reward you with a love, loyalty & joy you’ve never known! :)

Enjoy your new friend! You’re in for an adventure!"
