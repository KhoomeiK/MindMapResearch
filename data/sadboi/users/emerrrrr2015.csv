IAmA,fmyv1xh,t3_fxte0z,1586496636.0,what are some of your suggestions if you're just feeling lost... i know i have something wrong mentally but everyone i see has a different opinion so it makes things hard a frustrating for me how do you get to the bottom of a good plan to help yourself especially right now w very limited options. do you need to have a diagnose to treat your mental health it's hard when everyone says you have a different issue? :/
