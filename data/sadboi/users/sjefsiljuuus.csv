PinkpillFeminism,fr0p321,t3_gln1rq,1589802956.0,"I have never liked or enjoyed porn. My exes consumed too much of it - which resulted in me getting raped by them. They saw something on porn they just had to try out, and didnt think me telling them no was enough. It wasnt a valid argument for them. 

My current bf watches, however, I have noticed that he doesnt watch as much as he used to. I notice this due to how he acts and treats me. The periods where he watched a lot of porn, he got more cold towards me, more angry snd selfish in bed. He would lock himself in the bathroom for hours, while he knew I wanted sex and talked to him many times, asked him why he didnt wanted to be intimate with me, and I believed that something was wrong with me. When I first asked him about it, he got defensive and told me I overreacted, porn is normal, everyone watches it, didnt understand why I was so upset by it. He asked me if I was scared of him watching other women because I would believe he would cheat on me with them. I couldnt answer him or tell him everything because he got so defensive and angry. Two days after, I told him I wished I never told him about the issue I have with porn and never talked with him about it. He told me he was sorry and that he was happy I talked to him about it. I felt he lied to me just to calm me down. 

I havent told him that porn has influenced my rapists and porn is a big factor to why I got raped. I dont feel comfortable sharing that to him, because what if he says I overreact again? Its triggering me to know he can watch porn, and he does it even when I told him it was uncomfortable for me and that it hurted me. Even if he doesnt watch it as much as he did, he still does it, he knows what I feel about it. He still does it. He said to me he only watched porn when I wasnt home, and if I was, he would rather have sex with me. He lied about that because I have seen him watch porn while he is in the bathroom, and sits there for hours, while I sit in the room beside. He must think Im stupid or that I doesnt realize it - but Im way smarter than he thinks. It makes me feel disgusting and I start to not want sex with him because of it.

I find it very difficult to talk to him about sex, what I want to try out, needs etc because he often changes the subject or doesnt answer seriously. I have told him multiple times what I want to do and to try, he says we can do that but when I first ask, he always says he is tired or dont feel like it. It rarely it happens if I initiate sex with him, so I have kinda stopped even if I have a very high sexdrive. He has told me that he feels insecure about sex and want to be sure that he pleases me, and sometimes I can see he feels guilty because he says no when I ask him. He also said to me that he just dont feel the sexdrive as much as before, and I think porn has affected him and/or he has low testoteron levels. He told me he wanted to take a blood test to check it out, so far he hasnt done it. 

I have now recently tried to talk to him about porn and the news about pornhub (cp, rapevideo etc) and he thought it was disgusting and didnt understand how people could do that towards other people. However, I cant force him to stop watching porn, its his choice to do so. Im happy that he doesnt use it that much anymore, but I would be more happy if he just stopped completly and focused more on our sexlife. Most of the sex we have, its more like me doing him more than he is doing me. Its the same stuff and same pattern that happens, and I get bored. I have told him that I get bored and want to try new stuff, it feels like he gets defensive when I tell him. He tells me he is sorry but I dont see any changes. Most of the time, I finish him and he just assume its over - doesnt ask me if Im finished. I have to finish myself and I find it depressing. I have started to try to avoid sex as much as possible, because I would rather just do myself alone than feel like Im giving him a good time and dont get the same back. Sometimes it makes me feel used, like Im a person designed to only get him off. 

The problem also, is that even if we have these problems - I trurly believe that he loves me. He supports me at all times, cuddle with me a lot and do everything he can to take care of me. I think the problem is that he has a sexual trauma. He told me once that he one time woke up at a party and saw a girl over him. I told him it was rape, and he said he knows but never really talks about it. He doesnt think its as important as my rape. He has never gone to therapy for the trauma. He has a lot of different trauma. I believe treatment would help him a lot - traumatherapy helped me a lot to heal after rape. I have gained more confidence and started to explore my sexuality. I wish he would explore it with me. It feels lonely most of the time. 

Im really glad I joined this sub, it makes me feel less crazy for disliking porn."

My mother is a narsississt and sosiopath so its hard to tell, but since she never has told us kids this and this is something my brother just overheard, it makes me sure about it.

PornFreeRelationships,fnq8ln1,t1_fnpvynl,1587159775.0,"sounds like the guy was reasonable and knew what he did was wrong, and he did talk to you about it. its weird to see a dude respect you after being with someone who hasnt. im still surprised when my current boyfriend is very calm and asks a lot during sex ¬´do you feel good? do you like this? how are you doing? do you want to have sex? you dont have to do anything you dont want to¬ª and doesnt get mad if i say no!! what a catch. 

in contrast to my exes, where they expected me to have sex with them, forced me even when i said no. couldnt even sleep in peace without them bothering me. couldnt even drink without being forced to drink more until i blacked out and got used. i was called ¬´starfish¬ª a lot by them, because i just laid there doing nothing. i had given up when telling them no didnt work, forcing them off didnt work, nothing worked so i just laid there and got used. compared me to pornstars, wanted to try stuff they saw in porn - got their way because nothing helped to stop them. i blame the influence porn has on people a lot for most of my rapes.

i notice with my current bf that im not a starfish at all, i love to join in and be all in. he was the first guy who told me that he loved me during sex. he still does. one time i had talked to him in the morning, very tired. he thought i was awake and took my hand on him, and started to stroke it. he stopped quickly because he notcied i had slept off (i woke up while my hand was on him). he talked to me about it, apologized A LOT because he thought i was awake since i has talked to him 2 minutes earlier. i know he would never disrespect me, and since he talked to me about it and said sorry a lot, he almost cried because he was scared that he had scared me. he is a really good man, but it was weird to see someone apologize

it is rapey to fuck someone who is asleep, even if they say its okay for them. i dont want to sleep when someone has sex with me, i want to be awake, to know whats happening, to bond and connect with the person i have sex with. im not able to protect myself or my boundaries if i sleep. i could say ¬´its okay for you to do PIV when i sleep¬ª but what if i sleep and he does anal or something i HAVENT consented to? and im not aware? or if i didnt have birth controll and he didnt use condom? or made holes in the condom? maybe he would mix my sleeping pills in a drink to act out fantasies without me stopping him? it sounds very paranoid, but this is actually real case scenarioes, and if he first got premission to have sex with her while she is sleeping, while she use the pills, she doesnt know what he does to her while she sleeps. this is not about ¬´trust your partner¬ª in my opinion, im wondering what kind of people would be excited to see another person knocked out and wants to have sex with them? i believe its all about power and control. to want to have sex with someone who cant stop you, who cant defent theirselves, to have all that access and not have someone to stop you... its rapey. my boyfriend would NEVER think it would be exciting to have sex with me while i sleep. he think its horrible and disgusting that people actually want to, because basically, its about taking advantage on a person who is defendsless, cant set boundaries and protect theirself. they dont know whats happening to them while they sleep.

EDIT: antoher thing, if you sleep, the other person can record you without your knownledge. if the relationship ends, what if that person shares it or upload it on pornsites? i have heard a lot of stories of especially girls, have found clips on their partners phone, of themselves in their sleep while they partner does stuff to them. they never consented or got informed about it. makes me shiver."

i have some sleeping medication that is so strong i dont wake up no matter what until i have slept for 8 hours, if my boyfriend ever told me that would make him excited, i would run away as fast as i could. my boyfriend has seen me knocked out on those pills, sometimes tried to wake me up to check on me (i ask him to do this sometimes if i go to bed earlier than him), and he has told me multiple times it freaks him out the way those pills knocks me out so much. one time, i took them before bed and sat in the couch. they started to kick in, and suddenly it felt my body was paralysed, and he had to carry me to bed because i couldt move. he said ¬´i dont like those pills, some people are sick and would use them to hurt others. i dont think you should use them if they make you like this, it freaks me out¬ª. i dont use them at all because they gave me nightmares, but it also scared me how knocked out they got me.

however, im trying to see it as an experience, even if it damaged me and traumatized me a lot. because of this experience, i have learned a lot of different red flags and are able to use this story to warn others and inform people about dangerous behaviours. if i can help one person by telling my story, i think that would be a wonderful thing."

You are allowed to be frustrated. Just make sure its good communication and that you are having your needs met. I know for certain, as a person with ADHD, we can be a little handful at times. But in relationship, it takes two to make it work. I can only speak for myself when I say this, but sometimes, I dont registrer how my behaviours or habits affect others unless they tell me. Its not that Im selfish, its just more like, one million things to do but at all the same time. I got diagnosed with ADHD in 2002, but never got to know I had it until 2018, was then diagnosed again. So Im trying to learn how my executive dysfunctionals affects others, but also to learn to accept that I have the ADHD forever. Medication could lessen the ¬´symptoms¬ª of ADHD, but its a lot of options, and not everything works for everyone. Cognitive behaviour therapy is also recommended, and I want to get that so I can learn to manage my ADHD as much as I can in daily life. If not considered, you can suggest it for both for you?

I can relate to a lot of the things you say in the post. I experienced a lot of abuse because I wanted to know what ¬´love¬ª and ¬´affection¬ª was. a man beating me whenever i said no isnt love, i didnt deserve that and neither did you.

I feel Im in the same recovering phase as you. I now live with a man that has never disrespected me, and values me as a woman I am and will become. Im 22 years old. I am certain that no matter what, I will make sure to never depend on someone if its costing my health and/or life. 

I experienced sexual abuse as a child and later in my teens, it fucked me up a lot and made me believe that the more ¬´slut¬ª I was to men, they would want me more. It felt like my worth depended on men wanting me - and that felt really depressive. 

My current boyfriend has seen me for almost 2 years now seen the woman I was, and the woman I become. I have evolved a lot - with therapy and good support around me.

SexAddiction,fmjqlzk,t1_fmjkben,1586135704.0,"Yeah I know. I worked for a while at a mental hospital for young people with psycosis, and when I read their journals, most of them had addiction to drugs and trauma. It combines so well, because the ¬´dopamine-high¬ª we get is rewarding, but in addiction, the dopamine crave more extreme stuff eventually to get the same rewarding high. Its really interestning and fascinating how our brain works.

In late 2018, the police caught me doing illegal drugs, benzodiazepines, because I wanted to stop the pain from my trauma. The woman who worked at the police station, looked at me and said ¬´I would never imagine that someone like you would develop a drug addiction¬ª. She said that because I was freshed up, done my makeup, nicely clothed and had a fulltime job. Then I told her my trauma, and lets say that she was speechless. Now she is helping me with a case, and I got her personal number in case I need someone to talk to. She cried a lot when I told her my trauma and how it made me use benzos to cope with the pain. She treats me different, is more caring towards me and doesnt see me as a ¬´classic drug addict¬ª.

Due to the sexual abuse from early childhood, trauma and abuse from mother and her boyfriends, I never learned what a healthy relationship was supposed to be like. My first boyfriend was abusive and raped me a lot a year period time. Some of them were brutal, and it fucked up my brain lot. The dopamine had normalized rape, and normal passionate sex was boring because the dopamine craved more extreme stuff. That made me get with my second boyfriend, which was also abusive and raped me. Since every sexual experience was rape, it was so normalized that I couldnt feel the trauma it caused me. 

I ran away eventually, and met my current boyfriend. Im most likely a sexaddict, and I havent told him because well, not officially diagnosed and Im ashamed of myself. I notice my cravings gets more intense when Im stressed, sad, depressed, anxious, dont feel safe etc. Sex is a coping mechanism for me, but after being with my current for almost 2 years, I have been in therapy and learned a lot about myself. My mission is to try to learn the dopamine in my brain to act more normal (also have ADHD so I have dopamine issues). I have also tried to learn to do everything I can to take care of myself. Its hard to not act on the urges, but at least I have some tricks that works for me. Baking, photoshop, gaming, doing makeup and dress nicely, walk in the nature. 

I will eventually get therapy to treat the sexaddiction, and one day I have to tell my boyfriend about it. Now isnt the right time, I dont understand it enough to tell someone about it. One day at a time, things get better. Show your body love and warmth. Take a long warm shower, use body lotion and good masks. Treat yourself a good dinner. Learn to love the time you have for yourself, because now you have the possibility to focus ONLY on yourself! Sorry if the response was way to long, I got carried away. The quarantine makes me feel lonely so when I get the chance to chat, I use it very wellüòÇ

Most importantly, take care of yourself, only you! The more you love yourself, you will get more boundaries and see red flags from men, and see who is good for you or not. You dont need a relationship or malecompany to be happy. Set goals, where do you want to travel? What do you want to experience in life? What can you do to make it happen? Im glad you found my comment helpful‚ù§Ô∏è I wish you all the best, dont hesitate to pm me if you need someone to talk to"
SexAddiction,fmjiqxr,t3_fvn7d3,1586131130.0,"I havent been diagnosed - but I strongly suspect that I have the addiction as a result of severval sexual abuse in early childhood and in my teenage years. I have this urges, I have issues with male friends, because I feel I as a woman has to have sex with male to be loved and accepted. I believe this is because I got neglected as a child, and the inner child in me craves for affection and love. 

I dont know if I answer your question, but I try to best to answer, little unsure if I understood your question right, but I hope the answer will be helpful somehow.

I notice with my self that packing myself in with heavy cozy blankets helps me calm down, it gives the body the oxytnonin - you get it when you cuddle with someome as well. My urges gets less intense while Im packed in blackets, it feels safe and I feel protected somehow? Take the time to focus on yourself - what do you need to feel safe? What can you do to make you feel safe without acting out? Take one day at the time, do things that you enjoy. Maybe you like art? draw or paint on either paper or on photoshop? Do you have any games you can play? I use Sims 4 to distract myself from my urges, because then i need to focus on building houses and plan how they are going to look, and which funitures matches the house.

Treat yourself good, make a good meal, do makeup if youre into it, fix your hair or change style if you want to. Spend some money to get new fresh clothes to make you feel good. You are still young, and those males can wait for a while. It helps me when urges are intense."
ADHD_partners,fmjedc0,t3_fvjf4w,1586128626.0,"Both me (F) and my partner (M) have ADHD diagnosis, and are medicated with vyvanse - different dosages. I can relate to this a lot, my biggest issue is to wash clothes - it gets stacked up and suddenly its too much and overwhelming for me to do it. However, I know I need to wash those fucking clothes, or else we wont have clean clothes to use.

I often feel like I do most, like organizing plans or stuff, planning things and such. Some days I dont have the possibility do function at all, I have a lot of other mental health issues combined with ADHD. If he does something, like fixing his computer or changing clothes, he throws it on the floor and doesnt pick it up. The mess from stuff he does just lays on the floor, and I eventually have to clean it up and throw it away while he sits on the couch. He often tells me ""Im tired, I will clean up tomorrow"", often to see that it doesnt get done, and I have to do it. He is good with vaccuming and sometimes do the dishes,  cleans the table and kitchen. But compared to the chores I do vs the chores he does - I have the most of it and the heaviest of them, and it makes me want to explode sometimes. 

I often feel that if I have a bad day, where I dont function at all, we dont get dinner, stuff doesnt get cleaned as its supposed to, and clothes laying around the floor. Im now sick, with extreme cold, pneumonia and infection in both of my ears (I had to be tested for COVID, luckily its was negative). We havent even had dinner yet, I asked him hours ago if we could make dinner (I cant do it alone because of the pneumonia), and he said he would fix it. I asked him now if we could make something because we havent had dinner yet, and he just said ""we skip it today, its too late anyway"". Im hungry, but cant do shit because of the fucking pneumonia, I feel helpless. I want to snap sometimes as well, but since I have ADHD myself, I dont know when or if its right of me to snap.

We often communicate about this, and it works well. Im gonna have a new talk wth him tomorrow I think, about that I cant do the chores I normally do due to pneumonia and he needs to do them - because now Im more dependent on him since I cant do shit."
ptsd,fmj6hop,t1_fmcetoh,1586124013.0,"I got the results back again, luckily it was negative!! I just have an extreme cold and pneumonia, and got an infetion in both of my ears as well. Its better that, knowing its a sickness that can be treated, makes me less anxious. If you dont feel well, call your doctor one time too much rather than one time to little. My doctor told me to all at any time if I got worse. Yesterday, my boyfriend had to call the emergency because I got trouble with breathing, I couldnt speak and when the ambulance arrived, I passed out. We believe I used a lot of energy to breath, which made me pass out for a while. Im okay now, dont remember anything but my boyfriend was there and did an excellent job with taking care of me. I called the doctor again today to ask about the results, since I had coughed on my boyfriends face while I had passed out, and updated them about my symptoms. They were really nice and cared, and told me to call even if it was small changes or if Im worried. Told me to drink a lot and rest with my head higher up than usual.
I havent played that game, but saw it on the store when I looked few hours ago, due to me being bored of my games. I have Zelda BOTW, Pokemon lets go Eevee, Mario Kart and Super smash. Normally I would have played sims 4 on pc, only because I like to build houses and stuff. My boyfriends motherboeard broke, so he is borrowing my pc for some days until he gets the new motherboard. 
I struggle to keep myself active and not bored, but I try to wash my face every now and then with cold water, take showers, doing my makeup and fix my hair and find some nice clothing. Clean the apartment often, light some candles and make good meals. Cuddling with my rabbit, watch stupid clips on youtube with my boyfriend. I try to not read so much about the virus because its too much negativity, and I notice it affects my mental health a lot. 
Im happy to see that you are enjoying yourself! Your kids are so lucky to have an excellent teacher as well as an amazing parent! I enjoy art as well, I like to draw/paint in photoshop, and building houses in Sims with modded items and costum content gives me the ability to design freely and to create something uniqe. Its also really therapeutic, makes my mind more calm and I focus on other things than my ptsd and trauma."
sex,fmj2jsq,t3_fv8wc4,1586121742.0,"I can understand this as well. Severve sexual abuse during childhood and teenage years, very complicated and fucked up relationship with my body and sexuality. Took a looong time to learn to love myself and my body, still has a lot to learn. The euphoria it gives me, the empty head, no worries and i finally get relaxed. I notice during the quarantine now, I do it more often just to distract myself for developing depression. Childhood trauma starts to show up a lot more, and Im not in the right place mentally to do EMDR therapy again to treat it. 

The first time I figured out how to do it enjoyable, I cried of happiness. I then experienced this ""ecstacy feel"", and I felt I finally was on the right road to overcome the sexual trauma. Good music in the background, color lights and being all to myself really do the thing for my mental health. On the other hand, Im not sure if Im using it right at the moment, I dont know if I do it to pleasure and to love myself, or to just distract myself from stress, anxiety, bad memories and feelings, forget that Im starting to get depressed."

They only test people if they job in the healtcare system or you really need to struggle with your breath to the point you need a respirator.  One doctor here I live, refuses to test people and only tells them ¬´just take a paracetamol¬ª. I didnt even know they live on the hard surfaces uptil 72 hours. I have felt a lot of those symptoms you mentioned, especially fatigue, headache, runny nose and had a fever a few weeks back. My boss told me it wasnt an issue for me to work with elderly patients even if I was coughing, had a runny nose and felt an extreme fatigue because the corona only gave fever, sore throat and pneumonia. I didnt show up for work because I was unsure if it was safe or not - and the elderly patients would die by the flu, a cold so corona would be hell for them. 

My doctor thinks my extreme fatigue is because I have too low vitamin D in my system, so I try to take some supplements. Since I have a disability with my left foot, I cant go much outside as I used to (used to walk 30min - 90min walk every day before). But when I see the sun comes up, I try to get out and get some sun in my face. 

Thank you for this comment, it made me more educated and gave me more information than my actual government does here. Also, I highly agree with that corona is way worse than the flu. The flu and symptoms shows up quickly, while on corona, you can have the virus in your system uptil 14 days before you get symptoms. Imagine how much people you can effect at that time. Ugh, its freaking me out a little bit"
CongratsLikeImFive,flgscti,t3_focysj,1585149374.0,"This is one of the main reasons I strongly dislike the porn industry in general, and I hope there will be more cases like this where they shut down sites and law enforcement punish those who are in charge. A lot of the popular pornsites has childpornography, may not be easy to find but there is (research about it and you will find out that its true). Porn is damaging and harms the users, due to addiction of the dopamine-high, and because a lot of the people in the videos are either trafficted, raped, revenge porn, minors etc. A lot of the content on porn has normalized incest, violent and torture acts, rape and mostly shows women that pleasures men, and men feels power over them. There are may a few videos that shows genually consent, respect towards the partner and equality, but I believe its not many of them.

Im so happy to hear this, its showing me that there is hope and there will be action against these sites. Im so sorry to hear what you have been thorugh, you dont deserve that and I hope you are in a much better and safer place now. Im a rape survivor myself, and one of my rapists raped me because he was addicted to porn, and *just had to try the stuff they did in porn*.

ptsd,flgqphv,t3_fok9ew,1585148430.0,"I will as well say that I personally, experience that Im unaffected from the quarantine. I sit home, not having any social connecting with people, dont work due to disabilites - my life is excact the same as before the quarantine. I dont notice any difference on how the quarantine affects my daily life, the only thing I experience is that my boyfriend is home the whole day since his workplace is closed under the quaratine. 

Normally, I work as a nurse, but since I have some diabilites - I am not function at work in the time they need healthcare workers the most. I believe that if I was working - I would get so much stress and anxiety and just break down. I would have had to stop working eventually.

I feel people are kinda overreacting over this, but deep inside, I know the dangers of the virus. But as a coping mechanism, I have the tendency to make seroius bad things to not seem so serious and bad at all. I believe this is beause I dont want to get any more stressed about the situastuon that I already am from my PTSD and other illnesses. I get tired of reading everything about Corona - it makes me stress a lot more and I feel everything is only negative. Its everywhere, I dont feel I cant be on a social platform without any Corona studd, except for Reddit (because I choose what I want to see and not). Like for instance that everything is **CANCELED**, I would rather like if they said that eveything is **DELAYED**. The media has the oppurtunity to choose their words, and mostly the news about Corona is negative and has negative words. They write articles about worst case scenarioes, they write about the collaps of everything in the system, they write about everyone that loses their jobs, that the daily lives are changed for ever etc. Im not saying the issues I mentioned is not important - however, I mean its how they are writing the articles and their choice of words that kinda matters in my opinion.

However, I take it seriously enough to make sure I wash my hands enough, cover my mouth and nose if Im outside, uses handsanitizers at the stores to make sure Im not infecting other people or getting infected myself. There is people that wont tolerate the virus, and most likely end up dying because of it. I have gotten a reduced immunesystem because of all the stress my PTSD has given me, I notcied that since I get more sick now than before, so I believe that if I get that virus, I will get very ill, but I dont think I would actually die of it. Also, I believe we dont know enought about the virus itself, they need to do more research on it and how it operates (does it mutate, how often does it mutate, how does it affect individuals with different healt conditions, could there be other symptoms we dont know about etc). We should also get more people tested for it, because I am certain there are a lot of dark numbers on how many really has the virus."

rape,fkrzl9s,t3_fka6bf,1584479199.0,"i was sexually abused as a child by an adult, and sexually abused in my teenage years by two guys at different periods. im now 22 years old.

at a point, when i was 16, i drank heavily alcohol. i had got abused home by my mother and my first boyfriend raped me so much. i just wanted the pain to stop. then i got raped while i was blackout drunk (i was forced to drink, pressured by my ex), and i got scared of alcohol. still is. that made me selfharm, its like a drug as well. and i got addicted. i stopped when i left my first boyfriend.

my second boyfriend hurt me a lot and made sex unsafe. he always wanted me to act and behave like a little girl, like i was a kiddo. he tried to choke me in the pillow multiple times because he had fantasies. it scares me now years later if this is a really bad sign of something much worse. after i left my second, i drugged myself a lot with benzodiazepines, mdma, lsd, xtc. it felt amazing because i felt happy, the black depression was gone. on mdma, i could cuddle my currect boyfriend without fearing for my life. i was so influenced - i saw pink light shine around him. pink is my favourite color, and i felt safe and was so happy. 

the thing that really helped me was 1,5 year with therapy, emdr therapy. i kinda didnt want to dig in my head to reexperience everything again - but i was so sick and tired of living and seeing myself as the ¬´rapevictim¬ª. so i just decided no matter what, i just had to do it, and i couldnt stop, i needed to face my inner demons, as bad as they wore. when i first started therapy, i didnt remember the sexual abuse from my childhood - they appeared 7 months after i started with emdr. the more emdr sessions i had, the more memories came from my childhood. i think im past the sexual abuse from my teenage years, but i have to do emdr again for my childhood. the dilemma is - if i dont remember much now, is it that smart to dig it up? should i wait until i remember more, until it bothers me too much? at the time being, im mostly bothered with nightmares and bodymemories, and sudden change in personality (me becoming the little child i was).

i recommend therapy so much, emdr therapy as well. its all about connecting and having chemistry with the therapist. therapist need to ve experienced and trust is very important. emdr has made my life much better - even if it made me remember my repressed memories from my childhood."

my current boyfriend, he knows my past and exes. he doesnt care about that, he has only comforted me and showed me that he really loves me - even with the history i have. its good to feel safe with a man that doesnt has to make my traumas all about him. he lets me have my trauma for myself, he is only there for support. he told me that men like my exes were not men, they were scums and he was embarrased to know they shared gender. when i told my current boyfriend about incels, he got disgusted by the fact that incels actually are a thing."

one day at my therapist, i just said ¬´you know what, im so sick of hearing about my moms tales about the people in africa. I GOT ABUSED AND RAPED, IM ALLOWED TO BE ANGRY AND HURT!¬ª yeah people die of hunger, but that doesnt mean that im not allowed to tell that i got raped and abused my whole fucking life.

now im mostly saying to people ¬´dont ask me how im doing if youre not sure you really can handle the answer or if you really dont want the truth¬ª, because if people ask me - im going to tell them straight up how im fucking doing. thats not my fault. im allowed to speak about my past as much as people in general are allowed to speak about their a4 bubble lives.

TwoXChromosomes,fkb1baf,t3_fgn505,1584024075.0,"I want to add something as well to this post. 

I have been sexually abused as a child - but due to repressed memories I didnt knew that until I went to EMDR therapy for rape and sexual abuse that happened in my teenage years.

My first boyfriend, I was 15 at the time, was very immature and pressured me for sex. he got pissed and angry every time I said no or that I wasnt sure. I gave up eventually and let him do it. I just laid there, didnt do a thing and just froze. It hurted a lot but I was learned that if I was in pain the first time, it was good because then I ""proved"" that I was a virgin. The second time, he pressured me and raped me. I froze and just laid there. Until I found out that it took too long time, then asked him to stop it. He refused, because he had to finish. Then I just laid there again, froze. 

I tried a lot to say no, ask him to stop while we had sex but it didnt happen. I told him it hurt, but no that didnt stop him. I never felt good with myself afterwards, tried to tell him I didnt like sex, but he told me it was normal to begin with, and that I would like sex eventually. The reason I never liked ""sex"" with him was because he raped me.

Since telling him no and freezing didnt work for me, I then started to fake orgasms only to make sure he got more turned on, so he would finish more quicker. If he finished more quicker, then I didnt have to feel the pain of being raped. If I just alid there and froze, then I had to feel it hurt a lot more and longer. 

One day, while being with some friends, my ex boyfriend told a guy how much I hurt under sex, and that I hurt everytime he had sex with me, and had issues with getting it in (because I wasnt wet enough due to tension/rapetrauma). His friend looked at me and smiled rapey, and then said to me ""Well if thats true, maybe I could try you out as well? You seem to be one of those special girls"". My ex boyfriend said to me once that the pain I experienced gave him a good feeling because it reminded him of my ""innocence"" and that my pain excited him more. 

Now that Im writing this, I feel myself get angry because he raped me, because my pain reminded him of my innocence and that excited him? What the fuck"

Drugs,fjilqmh,t3_fda0gd,1583370414.0,"I dont know much about the case itself, but i heard of one man here in norway, who got caught with LSD (not sure how much). The law at the time said that LSD was one of the most dangerous one, as dangerous as herion i think. This man hired a really good laywer, did a lot of research, and then met up in court with the research. That case alone made the government change the law. LSD is still illegal, but it isnt classified as one of the most dangerous drugs more. 

Now in Norway, we are trying to change the law so that addicts and people that experiments with drugs doesnt get jail or punished for doing illegal drugs. The police cant give them a fine for illegal drug use, but has to help them to for instance seek help or go to treatment. Also, we want to change the law so that if I for instance go out on the street with 15 doses of LSD, and the police caught me, they cant punish me for it, because 15 doses is the maximum for a persons own use, and not enough to sell/deal. Each drug is going to get their own limit so that people that experiment with drugs can do it, without being scared for the police to arrest them and throw them to jail. The same thing would happen if I walked outsidewith 15 grams of weed, I wouldnt get arrested or get a fine for it because its for personal use. I really hope that law gets enforced this year. 

Jail, fines and police harrassing people doesnt help addicts to quit drugs. I dont trust the police, I want to be able to trust them, in case somehting happens and Im under the influence of a illegal drug. I dont want to get a fine or arrested for it. I dont think people has any business with what I do or take as long it doesnt harm others. If someone I knew for instance overdosed on MDMA or cocaine, and I had take MDMA as well, I would get a fine or arrested for doing illegal drugs if I called the police to get help.

Police has harrassed me a lot. I got a fine for doing diazepam, which I didnt had legally. I told them I had PTSD due to the sexual abuse and the abuse my mother did to me, but all they cared about was that I used diazepam illegaly and fined me. I paied the damned fine, but they still harrass me. I got ADHD, so I got Vyvanse legally to minimize the symptoms. I got stopped by the police when I was driving, and they took tests on me. Tested positive for amphetamine, and I told them I used Vyvanse. This happened in august 2019, they still hasnt finished the case and think Im an addict. Maybe they think that becuase I have the diazepam incident registred on me in their system. 

My doctor and therapist has told me that my PTSD most likely is a illness I will never get rid of, due to a lot of trauma I have experienced. MDMA, LSD, shrooms, ecstacy has helped me a lot with my PTSD. It makes me see things with a different perspetive, I think differently and has made a lot of choices due to those drugs - which has helped me a lot to overcome the sexual abuse I experienced. I felt safe for the first time after the abuse, to seek out and to be intimate with someone. I could sit right beside them and not get scared. I could cuddle without fearing for my live. It made me feel great with my self, I have had a lot of selfesteem issues after the sexual abuse. For the first time, I felt worthy. Im a real person, and I matter. I have a big potential to have a beautiful life. I have struggled with depression and anxiety most of my life, and LSD, MDMA, shrooms and ecstacy has helped me a LOT!

I looked at my boyfriend while being on MDMA, all I saw was the most beautiful person in the world. I also saw pink light around him, and I love the color pink. That was something special, it was amazing. 

 I will use them, I dont care if its illegal, I dont harm anyone by doing these drugs as long as I know how to use them - and dont get in situations where I for instance overdose and may traumatize others. 

MDMA had been used earlier due to treatment of PTSD - with good results. I would like to try EMDR therapy while being on MDMA, I think it could do wonders. 

Before, people though coffee was the devils work, and it got illegal. Alcohol was illegal before. I honestly have a theory that most drugs are illegal because the goverment makes money on it being illegal. All the fines they get from people experimenting with drugs etc. The big pharma could got a lot of money if drugs got legal, they could make some good medicine, maybe something like MDMA for PTSD or something? It would be more controlled and people would maybe trust the police more. I dont think every drug should be legal, like heroin and like that, but drugs like LSD, shrooms, MDMA, ectsacy, weed and that kind og drugs could be legal, BUT CONTROLLED. 

I also belive that if the system treat drugaddicts like shit, people think drugs are shit and all bad. The only thing the government does, is to tell that drugs are illegal and dangerous. They could tell us how to use those drugs, how to take care of yourself under the influence, give us the information we need so that we use drugs safely. 

Sorry if I mispelled something etc. Im tired and my Vyvanse has started to stop working for the day, and Im really tired. But I hope I got my point out correctly."

CPTSD,fjhw8my,t1_fj7oao9,1583356211.0,"Yes I recommend EMDR, but I have some criteria for why.

You need a very experienced therapist to do EMDR, you need to feel safe with the therapist and trust the therapist. The relation between you two should be good and honest. Dont do EMDR with someone if you dont feel quite safe with them or dont trust them. 

Second, you need to know that EMDR is a treatment where you will be words before better. For someone, it can be traumatizing. If you believe you have trauma you DONT remember, MENTION IT before you start EMDR. Mention EVERYTHING that you believe its trauma that has happened in your life. You decide whats your trauma and not, no one else. If you get suicidal, very depressed or anything - tell the therapist! OPEN COMMUNICATION

Third, when you start EMDR, you dont know what will come up, what memories, what feelings, what body memories. You should not force yourself, just relax, sit comfy in a sofa or a chair. Let things happen normally. Dont hold back anything.

Do you have any issues communicating your needs verbally? Tell the therapist. Plan a safeword/safesign together (in case you want to stop some time and need a break). Tell family, friends, SO, dont go throught it ALONE, NEVER! Its hard to do EMDR. If you can, go to the doctor while you do EMDR, check up yourself and just talk to them. Its nice to know they are there for you if you need them. Take a break of work those days you have EMDR. Take the breaks you need.

After a session, you will feel everything, remember things and see memories pass by in your head. Feelings comes back, body memories shows up. ALLOW YOURSELF TO GRIEVE. Trauma is damaging, and you are allowed to be sad and grieve. It can feel a lot easier afterwards if you allow yourself to grieve.

Last thing, after some time, try to forgive yourself. Forgive yourself for blaming yourself, you did nothing wrong. You didnt deserve this, and I hope its gets better for you! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
CPTSD,fj1gzj0,t3_fav8jf,1582919864.0,"I have this issue where everything has to make sense. It has to have logic for me to understand and accept it. If I dont see logic, I simply refuse to accept the fact. That can be a problem itself, because it will make me blind to things Im not open to see. It makes me not being able to learn something new.

My therapist just said to me one time ""what if the logic is that there isnt any logic behind it?"". It made me think for a while, sounded really confusing but it made sense, and gave me the logic I was looking for. 

Another thing I found peace with, is that for someone else, they might have another way to find or see the logical meaning behind things, maybe seeing a different type of logic than I do. As long as it makes sense and logical for me, with the information, experiences and what Im able to see it for, its completely okay. 

I am me. I function the way I do, I live the way I do, I see and mean what I do, simply because I am myself. And that, is my logic for me. Im trying to learn to find peace with that. People doesnt have to agree with me or mean the same, and thats okay. They are who they are, I am who I am.

With that position of power, I have serous doubts of her being a good cop and doing a good job out of her heart. She is 19 years old now. 

My brother on the other hand, have an icecold personality. He doesnt care about things, he just cares if it haves some negative effects on him somehow. His girlfriend is depressed, and he listens to her talk and stuff, but every time you see in his eyes he just doesnt care, is tired of her and just says ""stop biching around i had it worse my dad abused me shut up im tired of this"". He is scamming people, especially disabled people for money. He is known for the local police, one of his friends tried to attack the cops with a crowbar because the cops asked them if they had drivers license. He is 16 years old. He is cold, but very intelligent. He plays with peoples feelings to get it his way. He blackmails people to get it his way. He is one quiet person, but he analyzes everything and tries to find a possibility to find a persons weakness. I have tried to be very careful with information i share with him, but one day he got his hands on my journal from the therapist. I was supposed to show him another piece of paper, and he read some om my journal. He knows my diagnosis and my traumas, and somehow, he is going to use them as a way to blackmail me or play with my feelings. He tried to scam me for money, playing on my feelings. But what he doesnt realize, is that I know all the tactics he uses, because thats the kind of people I have lived with in my life. So he doesnt get me so easily.

Its sad to see how they are evolving. I have tried so much to encourage them to seek therapy, even if it feels like it doesnt bother them. They refuse and dont care, think therapy is bullshit. Yeah, i can clearly see that (ironic tone)"
CPTSD,fj14lv7,t3_fanbza,1582912912.0,"Oh my god, yes. YES. I can tell a lot about what my familymembers have experienced due to way they behave and treated me. I realize this is going to be a shitload of text, so be prepared if you wanna read. I find this topic very interestning as well, so thats why I write so much about it.

My mother is a narsisisst, she has most likely been abused as a kid. Her partens splitted up early, her mother is an alcoholic, her sister lost her father when she was 5 in a car accident, which made my mom forgotten and most likely not cared about. I can tell because my grandma always treated my mom and her sister different. My mom has so much anger towards grandma, always has. My mom didnt have her father a lot in her life, he always chose the relationship with some random woman, and his kids became a clear second. My mother has never been good enough for either of her parents. She never went to therapy for anything. Her father has most likely hit her, because my uncle told me he was pshycially and mentally absued by my grandpa. Both of my moms parents would suddenly get a new partner and have kids with them, and then do the same thing again. My mom has done this as well, neither me or my siblings has the same father.

I believe my moms dad, was and is some kind of porn addict. He had pics of all those nude women in his house, didnt care if children saw them. After learning a lot about porn addiction, I see he most likely is one of them. He wasnt nice with his girlfriends, neither his children. I would sometimes borrow his laptop, and he always had to wacth what I was doing, made sure I didnt look through his laptop. My brother told me not long ago, that he had heard my mom being upset, and telling about her dad being a pedophile, so maybe she got sexually abused as well as a child? But her mother didnt care because she was too focused on her sister, who had lost her father in a car crash. 

She got with my dad and they got me. Splitted up because she was controlling over him over his money, just for her to spend it on her own (guess this somehow is traumarelated issue, moneyproblems. i have read that a lot of people with childhoos traumas has money issues later as adults, because of the ""high"" they get on spending? its a way for them to forget about their horrible life earlier, and since they have traumas, they spend money on things because it gives them excitement for a little bit, a little bit of happiness over something new, forgetting the pain, and suddenly you spend more than you have).

She later on started to date men that clearly were abusive towards her and us children. Men with serious mental illnesses, men with domestic abuse history (one she was married to had just got out of prison for beating up his fromer wife), men with alcohol issues. All she ever knew was abuse and trouble, negelect and not being good enough. A sosiopath/psycopath could charm her so easily because most likely, she was way beyond traumatized, and never healed from it. My dad is THE ONLY NICEST MAN she has EVER been with. Im dead seroius when I say this, because I remember all of her boyfriends and every one of them was horrible. One of them sexually abused me when I was a child. The other one drank a lot, came home one night and screamed to my moms face that he had no problem to get a gun so he could kill her and us kids, one of us kids were his own son of blood. The current one, she is still married with him, but she is completely isolated and manipulated as hell. 

Her current husband, has threatned to hurt me, he has hit me right infront my mother. She didnt do a damn thing with it. He told my mom that either I had to get kicked out from the house (I was 15), or he would leave her. She chose him over me. He has forced my mother to have sex with him, or else he would leave her because she wouldnt be a real wife if she didnt give him sex. She was forced to wear some sexy clothes because he wanted her to, or else he would leave her. He made sure one after one from our family wasnt in contact with us, and now my mom is all alone with him. No methods to get in contact with her or anything. He forced her to delete her sosial media accounts, and made her share accounts with him. She has no private life at all. She is so isolated, and her husband tells her the whole time that he is the only one loving her, he is the only one caring for her, because no one from her family is around. He influenced her a lot. He is from Iran, I believe that he only married my mother to get the green card. He didnt do a damn thing in the house as cleaning and such, either my mother had to or me and my sister. That was a woman thing. And boys? If me or my sister had sex or any contact with boys before we got 20 and married, we would be dirty whores and not pure, no man would want us later. Men only want pure and well behaved women as their wives, and he sure as hell has made my mom to his model wife. 

Sooner or later, my siblings are in CPS custody. My brother got abused and hit by his father. My sister doesnt have anything to do with her father, the last time she visited him (she was 7/8 years old), she came home scared. Said he drank too much, and felt he was scary to be with. We dont know what actually happened while she was there. Her father was the one sexually abusing me as a child, so I feel a little bit concerned. I only have my father, he has always treated me nice. 

In my teenage years, I experience a lot of the same shit as my mom has experienced. Abuse from parent, siblings being better and liked more than me, abusive boyfriend that sexually abused me and tried to kill me. Started to drink heavely when I was 15-16 years old to egde of the pain. Experiment with drugs, like benoz, mdma, lsd and so on to edge of the pain. Combines it with alochol sometimes. One day, I went to my doctor and told her I was depressed and told her how my life was with my last boyfriend. I told her a bit of my history. My doctor then tells me ""it seems to me that you find those male figures you have grown up with, because thats whats normal to you"" and I got very offended and pissed at her. How dared she saying that to me. However, fuck hell, she was right.

Since 2013, when I was 15 years old, I have been in therapy, with different therapists for different traumas. I got diagnosed ADHD, PTSD, OCD, panic disorder, social anxiety, agoraphobia, most likely personality disorders (need to check up more before I can conclude). Now its 2020, Im a 22 year old with a hell of a story. But at least, I am the ONLY one in my family that has beein IN THERAPY. And I still need fucking therapy, but thats fine with me, as long as I stop the circle of abuse. I dont know if I want children, but if I get one kid one day, I sure as hell wont end up like a piece of shit parent my mother was to me.

I believe my mother has been lonely a lot in her life, craving for love and affection. Just wanted to be loved by someone. I am 100% sure she has been negelected and abused. She never went to therapy, she just became like her parents. Now, I have reported her to the police for the abuse she put me through, and most likely, it will get to court. 

I believe that she either knows how horrible mother she has been to her kids, but have serious mental issues that makes her not being able to stand up for herself. I really want to believe that deep inside, she knows how much harmful things she has done, but she wont admit it for herself because that would be another trauma for her as well. Or she just dont care, and are a plain sosiopath or psycopath. We shall see sooner or later.

But everytime I see a photo of her, I can see in her eyes that there is some kind of sadness and pain in there. Im just not sure what makes her sad and hurt... Its hard to tell when you dont know if she really cares or not of the consequences of her actions and behaviour. But she looks really sad and depressed, that I can say for sure. She has become a lot thinner over the years. I dont think she live a good life. I feel for her, but at the same time, she had a choice when she became an adult and a parent."
CPTSD,fj030tw,t1_fiydg95,1582886756.0,"I just want to add that I have been in EMDR therapy for 1,5 year, and I have to do more EMDR in the future - just on a little break for now. I have a lot of different traumas, the reason to why I was doing EMDR now was because of the sexual abuse as a teenager. The EMDR therapy was great, however it came with a price. I started to remember repressed memories about sexual abuse as a child, and experience more body memories as a aftermath. 

Also, want to add that before my childhoos trauma came back to life again, I still struggled with pain, but after the childhood trauma came back, the pain has become more often and worse than before. Before the childhoos trauma came back, I only believed it was some weird periodpains, and tried different NSAIDs medication (parcetamol to mention one example), but no effect. Then I read online that sex and orgasms could help with the periodpains, and I tried that. Sometimes, it worked. After the childhood trauma showed up again, this has been problematic. Often after an orgasm - the pain gets even worse and I feel disconnected and has almost blacked out. I get anxious and sometimes naseous. The sex itself has been good and passionate, and we both use good time with eachother to make sure both is warmed up. 

So after reading some of the comments, Im now more sure its PTSD symptoms in form of body memories. It makes sense with the timing when he childhoos trauma first came back to life again, that Im not in therapy due to taking a break to just collect myself after 1,5 year with EMDR sessions every week. 

I just think its weird how it is little talk about the pshycial symptoms of PTSD, because I feel what people talk and hear more about is the anxiety and the flashbacks. This has made me feel that when I dont have the mental symtpoms of PTSD for a while, that Im ""fixed and cured"", which is wrong. A lot of doctors, therapists has now told me I most likely not only struggle with only ADHD my whole life, they also believe my PTSD will be chronical and that Im not compatiable to work like normal the rest of my life. Im now in a process where Im getting examinated and mapped, and will eventually become some degree disabled because of PTSD. That fact makes me a little sad, because I feel I get punished for being born. At the same time, me eventually become some degree disabled from work will also be a blessing, because then I know for sure how sick I actually is, and will be more kind to myself."
CPTSD,fj01yam,t1_fizvbw7,1582885307.0,"Relationship has been hard for me as well, Im very lucky with my boyfriend at the time because he is so supportive, kind, and has never done any harm towards me. Very loving and compassionate, very considerate and really cares about consent (!!), which my exes never did. I guess some of the good ones are out there even when we have seen the worst in others. 

Im definetly going to check it out, because if it is body memories acting up, all I need to do is to learn my body that it is over. My head is more in place after 1,5 year of EMDR therapy, its more my body acting up, which I believe you are right - the body keeps the score. I hope it will work for you if you consider to try it, and good luck! Glad to see Im not the only one with the same problems, which makes me a more normal and not irrational about it."
CPTSD,fj00te1,t1_fiz56uo,1582883720.0,"I have the same problem as well! Not always with penetration, but sometimes. If the pelvic floor is the issue, then it really starts to make sense."
CPTSD,fj00qam,t1_fiz0m50,1582883595.0,"I remember my traumatherapist suggetsting something like this as well, because I told her I had a lot of pain and my body was sore from nothing, and how I always felt tired and had no energy at all to do really a thing. When I told her about the pain I experience down there, which has started to show up more and become worse over the last few months, she suggested I should check myself for pshycial illness / problems, even if she was really sure everything was because of my PTSD. She wanted me to get the paperwork in place, so I could get the right treatment for it. She has asked me to get a blood test, check at a gynocologist and a general check for my pshycial health as well. My bloodtests turned out fine, only had too little of vitamin D - which is normal at winter.

I could try to use a big soda bottle, fill it with warm water and see it if does any wonders. Due to a lot of changes of my doctor, its hard to get a check up and get followed up as good as I should have been from the beginning.

Im sure some of my doctors thinks I just wants drugs, due to me getting prescribed dexamphetamine, opiates and now oxazepam at the same time. The last doctor I was to, he checked up all my earlier medications and dosages for my ""periodpains"" and questioned me why it didnt worked for me at all, because all the earlier medications were supposed to work, and I even had high dosage so it wasnt meant for me to not get better from them. I believe the opiates I use only helps because the morphine helps my muscles to relax a lot, but the problem with opiates is the tolerance and addiction. I dont want to use opiates at all, and I have already noticed that I have become really tolerant on them. People see me on the opiates and cant tell the difference if Im on opiates or not at the time, because Im acting so normal and causal.

I went on urine tests regulary because the doctor wanted to check if I misused any drugs, and after a year with tests, it has showed them that I havent, which makes them wonder what the hell my problem really is and how they can help me. I will definetly save this comment and talk to my doctor when I get one doctor that I will have for a longer time period than I have for now - where they have switched out the doctor every 1-2 months. Thanks for your advice, I really appericiate it and Im happy to hear it worked for you!!"
CPTSD,fiydg95,t3_facuay,1582837280.0,"I feel this as well. Lately, the last couple of months, I have had big issues with work and tasks, as well as  maintaining my own house. I sleep over half the day, dont feel I have any energy at all no matter how much I sleep. 

Lately, I have notcied why I dont have a lot of energy when I¬¥m awake. I have a lot of nightmares about my traumas. I start to feel a strong painful feeling down there, due to earlier sexual abuse. One time, I woke up with me kicking and fighting off someone, because I dreamt that my abuser did it all to me again. I was so confused when I woked up, because my bedroom was all dark, and no one was there. My body constantly shivers the whole night, my boyfriend has commented a lot on this. Another night, I woke with strong pain down there, and was almost unable to get to the bathroom. It wasnt periodpains at all. I almost collasped and passed out, it felt like i had a fever, I felt I was totally disconnected from reality, didnt understand where I was or why it was happening to me. I had trouble breathing because the pain down there was way too strong. I sat on the bathroom floor for 20 minutes, confused as hell, but had to sit in a really weird position, because if I didnt, I would feel that pain too much and eventually pass out. I believe its my body remembering the sexual abuse.

Sometimes, the pain is so strong that I have to take opiates to ease them, it doesnt always work. I recently was to a gynocologist, and nothing was wrong with me. Before the consultation, I had a lot of anxiety and I felt this pain down there, it hurt like hell. While i was driving to the appointment, I still struggled with the pain. While I had the consultation, I was painfree, but had almost a panic attack. After the consultation, the pain came back even more painful, and I had a panic attack in my car. It is all pain because my PTSD acts up and remembers the sexual abuse I experienced as a child and a teenager, I guess.

Also, I have started to develop anxiety for sleeping, because I know nightmares will come and torture me. I tried medication like Zolpidem, but it makes my nightmares even worse. I just got prescribed Oxazepam I can take when I feel the need to. I noticed when I took 1x10mg 1-2 hours before sleep, and 1x10mg right before sleep, my nightmares doesnt come at all, and I feel calmful. 

I guess my body is on edge constantly, mostly at night, and it fucks up with my energylevel a lot. On the other hand, I also have diagnosed ADHD, and have been prescribed Vyvanse and it works amazing on me. A lot of the ADHD and PTSD symptoms I experience look a lot of alike, but behaves very differently."
relationship_advice,ffq3bxy,t3_eu5gfv,1580118125.0,"(EDITED) 

my first boyfriend was abusive towards me. he broke up with me because he blamed everything on me, i believe he did it to teach me a lession. i tried to be friends with him, because i was too brainwashed by him and i was very dependent on him. me being friends with him only made things worse. he was a lot kinder to me during our friendship than he was to me as my boyfriend, but he also became more abusive. every guy that tried to flirt with me or even talk to me, he scared away and threatned (without my knowledge) because he wanted me isolated and all alone for himself. he started to rape me more brutally, he tried to kill me multiple times, he beated me up a lot. 

to those who want to ask me why i still tried to be his friend despite the fact he did all this; i didnt knew any better. i have been sexually abused as a child, abused by my own mother until i moved out as 15 year old. all my life was about abuse, i didnt knew abuse was wrong. he manipulated me a lot and told me that he would kill himself if i didnt was his friend. and he treated me good, very good sometimes, but also very horrible. that made me believe i deserved the horrible things, because he sometimes was kind to me. fucked up logic, right? i know. but thats the truth.

and the hardest part is that my ex boyfriend was the kindest person i had ever known, when he wanted to be nice to me. he cuddled with me while i was crying and wanted to kill myself, he gave me his support, he made sure i wasnt alone. all that was a part of his act, to make sure i never left. eventually i just couldnt handle it anymore and left. he stalked me a lot afterwards, drove around the city to look after me, to scare me and beat me up. i got together with a new one, and then my ex boyfriend told people around me that he missed me and all these nice stuff. he got angry when i didnt talk to him after that. he could stop talking to me, just ignore me, to then later send me pictures of him harming himself, telling me he was going to kill himself, because he knew i cared about him. and after a whole life with abuse, you get addicted to the stimulation the abuse gives you, trust me on that. sometimes when he stopped talking to me, i just said ¬´ok¬ª to
him and didnt care because i was tired of the shit he gave me but he came back. apologized a lot. if i didnt visited him, he showed up at my house and forced himself inside. i wasnt safe at my home or other places, he would find me no matter what. i believed at some point i would never get rid of him, and therefore it was the best to be on his good side. after i got NC with him, he was outside my house a lot, looking after if i was home or not. i saw him and heard him, and had to hide so he couldnt see me. i saw him once outside, and we talked. it wasnt on purpose. he then told me ¬´i know i did some very serious bad things to you, and i wish i never did it¬ª. that was serious for him to say, that shows he knew what he did to me. but he had lost that control over me and was desperate to get it again. that was his last try. he wished he never raped me and abused me because i got away and he is at risk where i can tell someone about how he actually is. he doesnt care or feel bad, he only cares about himself and feels bad for not controlling me enough to make sure i would shut up. at new years eve now, me and my currect boyfriend were out with friends. my rapist shows up and talks to us. we try to keep it causal due to the people around us. after my rapist left, my boyfriend got so upset and screamed after him ¬´i hate him so much, he raped my fucking girlfriend and he goes free like nothing!¬ª. i got upset later due to how causal my rapist acted, he even talked to me like nothing happened. if i were alone with him, i know for certain that encounter would have bewn dangerous - he knows i have told people and he would punish me for it. he lose more and more control every day, and thats dangerous in an abusive relationship. the abusive one feel comfort in having control over the other person and does literaly ANYTHING to get that control.

i NEVER wanted to be abused. however, i have been abused so much, that i still crave for that stimulation longterm abuse gives to its victims. a normal healthy relationship is boring when you are addicted because the drama, the adrenaline you get when your life is in danger, the lovebombing is constant in an abusive relationship. you have used a lot of mental energy on someone, and its hard to realize that you have wasted all that energy of someone. when you have been abused or are getting abused now - i would say you kinda live in your own bubble and lose a lot of insight from whats really happening. and even if you got out, it still takes a long time before you see it for what it acutally is - abuse. i was with my first boyfriend for 7 years ago, i got away 6 years ago. it hasnt been until recently i learned and saw all of the shit he put me through, because he is a selfish fucker. 

she needs therapy, this isnt good at all. he will at some point, if he havent already, do her more harm than earlier. you need to take care of yourself, this isnt something you can fix. she wont understand how dangerous this is until she actually can see whats wrong, and it doesnt look like she want to. leave if this still continues, i know you love her but you need to love yourself aswell. this shit can traumatize you. you should also go to therapy, because this will take a toll on you and if you continue to be with her - it will break you completly. to constantly worry if something will happen, if something has happened, her not understand the risk of this friendship, her defending her ex all the time and not care about your feelings and opinions. that could count as emotional abuse. 

she doesnt want to be abused as well, but she doesnt love herself enough to respect her own boundaries. she has them, but she lets her ex oversteps them no matter what. she doesnt have to cry because of guilt, she doesnt has to cheat with him. she could cry because she know her boundaries has been stepped over and she may feel she should have done something to stop it. if he is a really good actor - he could do something and while doing it, convince her its all normal and that she is doing it voluntary even if she doesnt do it voluntary.

be careful, take care of yourself please."
ptsd,fcx687y,t3_ej536l,1578052926.0,"i feel the same way. i was always tired and slept the whole day, missed out on events and lost relationships with people in general. no one seemed to see the stress i was carrying around in my body, and never understood why i was so tired all the damn time. neither did i, but that was because i didnt take myself serious enough to learn to understand my bodys response to the traumas i have endured my whole damn life.

my two only solution was to actually get ADHD diagnosis, which i had gotten already in 2002, but since i never tried medication or even learned i had ADHD until the end of 2018, i had to get the diagnosis all over again. my medication keeps me awake and stabilizises my mood. i use a very high dosage, and since im functioning very well now, i have to pay a price for it. for every higher dosage medication, i get a more cold personality and feel i kinda lose some parts of my self. however, i also love that i get a more cold personality on medication, because then im well functioning in daily tasks, im awake the whole day, i dont feel much of those negative ptsd emotions anymore, unless im very very triggered. the other (2) solution was to realize i had endured trauma and was not treating myself right. i did EMDR therapy for almost 1,5 years, ended it recently because i feel i have worked on the rape trauma - however i need to do emdr more due to other traumas. EMDR needs to be done with the right therapist for YOU, i cant stress this enough because the choice of a therapist can effect the whole EMDR treatment, how beneficial it is for you or not. 

my traumas may have changed me to eventually become a sosiopath and a narsissist, and i say this because me and my therapist did screening on these - as well with other personality disorders. that could also be a reason to why im a more colder person now than before. i have no empathy for people that doesnt interest me, i only feel warm and empath towards people i really love, or people im interested in someway. that has also made me lose friends, because i simply just dont care about things, or a person if it doesnt give me anything or doesnt seems interesting for me. i need to gain a benefit somehow for being emphatic with people - due to me being a empath before and that only got me abused in many horrible ways my whole life."
loveafterporn,faog0cd,t1_faod5zl,1576263504.0,"thank you for your comment, i really appericiate it! we did combine EMDR and ADHD treatment, since i wished to do that, which have done wonders. i am able to be more focused in the sessions, which gives me more ability to recover from my trauma. 

i have thought about that, its hard to tell him how challenging it may be some days. i dont feel i have those compulsions as much as i did, but i have a lot more i need to work on in order to recover. i have asked my therapist if she can send me my journal, which gives me the ability to read over it. i have planned to show some of it to my current boyfriend, because it would be easier for me to tell him that way. i have a big challange with verbal communication, so my journal will help me a lot this way.

i joined this sub months ago, simply because i didnt know anything about the negative effects on porn. i came to a point where i had questions i didnt had the answer to, and this sub has helped me to get more informative about the matter. i feel its one of the few subs that we could be open about the issue. but i agree with you, it could re-traumatize me, and im trying to be aware and dont use reddit on bad days, which has gone well so far. if i use reddit or other sites and i dont feel i could handle it at that point, i do something else like taking a walk, doing my makeup or cuddle with my rabbit. it may be good to take some space from this sub while im at it, but maybe once in a while give adivce or give positivty if i feel i can handle to read things. i need to see how my mental health is before i eventually do so first.

thank you again for your comment, i really appericiate it! i feel i have come a long road, still a long way to go but i will do it. so far, recovery has given me a lot of my life back in ways i didnt believe it would. im happy that i have the chance to reflect on myself, my behaviours so i can be a better partner for my boyfriend, and most importantly, learn to take care of myself."

ptsd,fadoa90,t1_fadjhdz,1575981040.0,"im glad to see im not alone experiencing this, however im also sad to see that you had to experience it as well. it makes me wonder how serious PTSD actually is, and to wonder how much PTSD actually affect a person? i feel most of the time, if people hear about the diagnosis, they think about flashback and anxiety, which is common symptoms. on the other hand, i believe PTSD has a lot more symptoms and aftermaths after such traumas, maybe its more taboo to speak about it or something? 

my friends has also gotten used to me have these moments where i have those uncontrollable shakings, but it freaks me out because i dont know what my body are trying to tell me at all. i have notcied that when i abused benzos and alcohol, i would sleep a lot deeper and not have those shakings. it makes me feel bad about myself because the potential to an eventually addiction is there, and im trying hard to not abuse it.  

in my last relationships, i had fantasies to cheat and to have sex with other people. i got so bored of them, and if i met strangers, i wouldnt stress about the intimacy because i didnt knew them. i cheated on both of my exes (they were both rapists anyway). the first one, i sent nudes to other guys to get that attention. i just didnt care about if i were in a relationship or not. with my other ex, i cheated on that stage where i had an emotional affair and later multiple sexual encounters with someone. i believe my brain experienced the stimulation from rape so much that it eventually started to crave that much stimulation. i didnt experience my first time calm and safe, it started right on with rape. this has made me have big issues with intimacy with my boyfriend, and i struggle to know how consensual loving sex should be. people has also based their opinion of me based on the fact if i sexually satisfied them. the more i satisfied them; the more valuable i was. when i was a child and had access to inernet, i talked with way to many men that i shouldnt even talked with. i sent photos of my self to get that attention since i had a very sexual behaviour as a kid. deep inside, i knew they wanted to do things to me that would hurt me, but i only wanted to be loved by someone since my own mother never cared or loved me. already when i was 9 years old, i saw heavy porn and over 10 years later, i remember the first porn i saw. it was brutal, objectifying women and violent towards women. im a 22 year old female. 

i struggle with the same, i used to do better in school, i was healthy and was never sick. after the traumas, i had almost weeks where i didnt show up to school, i was almost sick all the time, and i slept over alarms because i was so tired. im not sure if my unmedicated ADHD at that point had a role in that part, but it got a lot worse after the abuse. in 2016 - 2018, i had a fulltime job and now i cant even work two days a week without that being too much for me. its unrealistic to say i will get 100% better from PTSD, even if i dont have that much flashbacks or mental symptoms. however, i dont feel like im not having PTSD anymore, i feel like it just become worse but on another scale than before. i feel more stupid than i was before. sometimes its just too hard to do normal chores because i just freeze and blank stare in the wall for long periods. i struggle with a serious depression around november - february every year due to a lot of trauma happened at winter time. i cant stop myself getting depressed either. i tried sleeping pills, but they fuck up my sleep after one day using them, so i dont use them unless i really have to. i want anxiety pills instead i can sleep on, because its anxiety that keeps me awake at night. it doesnt fuck up my sleep either if i dont abuse them. 

thanks for your reply, it made me feel less alone about this. i hope it gets better for you and please do take care of yourself. you deserve everything good and self love."
GenderCritical,fadhtzz,t3_e8gtoy,1575972345.0,"im sad to say that one of my rapist most likely were addicted to porn, and his addiction made him rape me and almost chocke me to death a lot of times. he compared me to porn stars, told me i had to act more like them or else he would get bored. my first time with him was rape. i had this feeling of something not being right, but he laughed it off and told me i was a weird girl and that i would love sex eventually. it never got better, the only thing that changed was that he became more brutal and dangerous. it was shocking for me to realize that porn was a huge reason to why he raped me, and why he raped me as brutally as he did. he craved that dopamine high so much that he ended up raping someone to feel that high for 30 seconds. its tragic to think about. he willingly ruined my life just because he needed that high when he got off. porn gave him the ability to become more dangerous than he may would have been without porn in my opinion."
adultsurvivors,f5k1yxp,t3_dnydfz,1572252519.0,"before i remembered the csa and before i knew i was raped at 15, i would say i lost it when i was 15. i dont remember much of my csa so i dont remember when it started or ended. but abuse doesnt count as losing virginity in my opinion, because when you lose your virginity, it is because you willingly have consensual sex with someone. 

i would now say i lost my virginity when i was 20, due to the fact at when i was 20 years old, i met the first guy in my life i had consensual sex with. when i was 15, i was abused and raped, as well as when the csa happened. i was sexually abused from i was 15-20 by two different persons, and i refuse to say they took my virginity - i never gave it away willingly in a consensual act. my virginity is something i decide to give away to someone by having sex with them, all consensual. 

my rapist from when i was 15-16 would probably tell anyone that he took away my virginity - and he is not allowed to get that honour. what he did to me, was to break me and to ruin my life. he is one of the reasons i have ptsd. i never gave my virginity away, he stole parts of me to what i consider is parts of myself to have a healthy life and decent body image etc. to feel confident in my self and my looks. what he took from me was years of happiness, and made them with guilt and me having big issues with ptsd. 

i wish i could tell my current boyfriend, the first man i ever have had consensual loving sex, that i would consider him being my first due to the past history of multiple years with sexual abuse. that i feel that he is the one i gave away my virginity to. maybe some day i will, but for now i know it myself and thats whats helping me cope with the abuse i endured."
cptsdcreatives,f2atvm6,t1_f1mtx25,1570117728.0,"sorry for the delay on the reply, i was supposed to reply and just forgot.. x) im so happy to hear that you have come this far. peoples actions doesnt tell us who we are, it tells us who THEY are. if someone abuses us, it says something about them, not you and me. we never asked to get abused, and no one asked to get abused at all. abuse is all about power, taking controll over other peoples lives. 

i have never believed in God, simply because i havent learned about him at all. no one in my family believe in God, which explains why i havent learned and heard so much about him. however, i do believe that your points sound trurly amazing and i can somehow relate to them. my traumas were like hell to experience, but it also gave me the ability to learn something and to help people that struggle on another level than people most. it made me understand more, and it changed me as a person. i dont find that a bad thing, because i had to change myself. i was too kind and let people use me as their door mat until i told them stop and refused to be their door mat anymore. im a person with feelings and i matter as well. my boundaries matters. i lost a lot of family and friends due to me changing, but that only shows that they really didnt care about me at all, and thats fine with me. (: 

im still caring and shows affection for those i really love, i have a big heart and a lot of emphaty to those who trurly deserves it. my mother was abusive. she got abused as a child, as i have been told recently. i can understand her more on why she was like she is, and that she has some traumas she never coped with - but that didnt make it okay for her to abuse me and give me traumas as well. her story only allows me to understand her more, but not tell her her actions towards me was or is okay at all. as a child you dont know better, youre innocent and you dont know whats right or wrong, you dont know what abuse is. as an adult, you have way more responsebility and most adults know that abuse is not okay - abused as a kid or not. im a 22 year old adult and i would never treat my child like my mother did treat me. it seems that it has been a lot of abuse in my family and alcohol abuse, but im going to be the first person after my mother that stops the circle of abuse. im not going to be like her. my traumas learned me a lot, even if it was a very painful way to learn it. however, with those traumas, i have the ability to spot things most people dont see. i know a lot about these issues due to my own experiences. i know abuse once i see it. i know what i can say or do to help people in similar situations, and i think thats a gift itself. i found your comment trurly inspiring, thank you so much!!"
GenderCritical,f2a1b5n,t3_dcleqr,1570107176.0,"i remembered that as a i child, i sometimes wondered if i was i boy because i didnt like pink and dolls, and most of my friends were boys. i felt confused, and it got worse as i got 10 - 12 years old and girls in my class started to wear makeup and i couldnt care less. my mom also told me it was weird that i as a girl didnt like ""girly stuff"". i often believed that i was born the wrong gender and wanted to become to a boy at some point. as the time passed and i was a teenager, i realized that i wasnt less of a girl because i had other hobbies and interests than the girls i knew. i was just me. im 22 years old today, and i enjoy the colour pink more now because i find it beautiful, not because its a ""girl colour"". on the other hand, i also love blue and think thats beautiful. i enjoy doing makeup and look good, however, i also enjoy being geeky and do coding on the laptop. that doesnt make me another gender, that just shows who i am and what i like. i wished someone told me this as well when i was younger, and that my hobbies and interest werent wrong because they werent ""girly enough"". excellent written by you!"
rape,f1ovdhf,t3_da8dpx,1569663972.0,"i felt the same way as you about a year ago. my first time happened when i was 15 with my first boyfriend. he did it multiple times over a year. then i met someone else, he seemed better but as the years passed, he did the same thing as my ex. i believed i was healing at that point, but i wasnt. now im with my third boyfriend and he is different. nice, treats me good, always care about consent, respects me and i can talk to him about the trauma. he has been amazing support. after starting therapy last october, i figured out that i have a long life and i dont want my trauma to affect it as much as it has the last 6 years - almost 7. i have things i want to do, places i want to see and to experience life. i deserve to treat myself good and give myself the best life as possible. another thing that has helped me, is to think that the more the rape trauma take away from me and dont let me enjoy, the more my rapists wins. im gonna let them lose, and show them no matter how much they broke me, i got back up again, all alone. 

last weekend i saw my first ex (rapist) and he was drunk. he tried to talk to my friend and my boyfriend and i got scared, almost had a panic attack. then i felt this urge to just not listen to my ptsd. i took a deep breath and just walked towards him. my boyfriend was supposed to just get us burgers, and he didnt want to talk to my rapist. i walked towards them and noticed that my rapisr turned around, and saw me walk towards them. he turned from smiling until getting a dead serious face. he said hello to me anyway, and i said it back. i placed myself right beside my boyfriend and thought ¬´im so fucking tired that i need to get away because youre here, now its your turn to get lost because im here. IM CONTROL THIS, NOT YOU. you hurt me, you should remove yourself¬ª. clearly my rapist got uncomfortable with me standing right there, so he just left. i could feel my heart bit faster than ever, but i reminded myself that this is my life and he is not allowed to stop me living my life. im still happy i had the courage to do this.

the point is that it may seem pointless and hard to believe but it will get better! dont rush it. take the time to grieve, and then start to takw care of yourself. take a nice warm shower, put on some good smelling body lotion on your skin, take on some warm and soft clothes. give your body and skin love. its not you, you didnt do anything wrong. the rapist did. they know what they have done and have to live their whole life knowing they raped and violated someone. while we on the other hand, we get to live a life where we experienced a horrible trauma, but we still lived our life. its not easy, but see the effort you have made. YOU STILL TRY EVERY SINGLE DAY! im so proud of you, you do the best for you as long it keeps you safe and good about yourself!üíó"

cptsdcreatives,f1hr4gv,t3_d9fsle,1569499372.0,"this is accurate for me as hell right now. i discovered right before summer that i had trauma from csa after having emdr for sexual abuse when i was 15-20 years old. since i coped with that trauma, my head was ready to show me what the little child experienced. i have only felt body memories until last weekend, when i experienced a horrible flashback from my childhood which i havent remembered at all. yesterday at my therapist, i told her this and we are now certain about the csa. she told me i should look at the case like a little girl trying to reach for safety and comfort from an adult. since the adult me dont have too much dealing with at this point because of emdr, the little girl inside me finally reached out for help to tell the adult her story and get safety. i have felt that i have been in a inner conflict with myself. however, seeing this made me more comfortable with the situation. im going to try to protect the child and show her that not adults are bad. im going to try to show her she isnt alone anymore and that the monster isnt here anymore. i will try to be the adult she needed so bad when she was scared and all alone. im going to save this image to remind myself to take care of myself and the little girl inside me. thanks for posting this, it brought tears to my eyes"
RedPillWomen,f1b1fvy,t3_d8fkt8,1569319200.0,"i struggle with this as well. i also have severve ptsd due to rape and sexual trauma. when i first got ptsd, i acted out very sexual and let men do whatever they wanted with me because i didnt matter anyway. i was a property. this made me get raped again after my first trauma. i didnt knew i had a value as a person, and that my sexual needs were important. the only reason i excisted was because i had to please the male. 

i started to go to therapy last year, in october. i started with emdr therapy (trauma therapy) and have been doing it since then. still doing it. 

i got together with my current boyfriend last summer, and i have always had issues with taking initiative and show interest with sex. i always felt ashamed and guilty when i wanted sex. i was scared of using my boyfriend, scared that he would feel that i tricked him or used him. i am still scared of become like the ones who raped me. they always tokk initiative and my brain connected taking initiative with abuse. the ones who raped me also showed affection before rape, so when my boyfriend wanted to just cuddle, my brain told me he only did it for sexual reasons and that made me pull away. i was very conflicted with myself because i didnt know what a healthy relationship looked like. 

while i have been in therapy, i have learned more about myself and how much my trauma has affected me. im now at the point where the actual trauma dowsnt affect me that much, its more the aftermath of them. i dont know myself at all, when it comes to sex and kinks. i have never focused on myself or my needs. i have the last year learned what consensual sex is, i am 22 years old and i have had ¬´sexual¬ª (SA and rape) experiences since i was 15. the feeling of guilt and shame still haunts me, i have issues with wanting sex and tp show interest, so if my boyfriend was to ever write about a dead bedroom, he would tell that i was LL. this summer i have tried to learn myself and focus at myself in sex. i have tried to just masturbate and to find out what feels good or not, and that journey has been really difficult. i hate to say i want sex, verbal interest is hard for me. i like to use my body language because it feels safer for me to communicate that way. i havw anxiety due to performance and i put a lot of pressure on myself because im ashamed of myself due to the trauma (i wish that i was more experienced and that i knew how i could do sexual positions etc, rather than only know what rape is). i have tried to talk and communicatw with my boyfriend, i still have a lot to tell him and i have told him this. i just need some time to find the right words and to make sure he understands this isnt a problem he is supposed to fix, but something i need to work on alone. recently, my emdr therapy has made me realized that i got sexual abused as a child and this has made things more complicated. the talk im supposed to have is harder to have because i have to tell him about the CSA, but time will come and i will tell him eventually when i know how.

my whole life i have based my value as a person if i have sex or not, if someone finds me sexual attractive and i have as long as i can remember only thought about sex and how i can get it. i believed at a early age that if i gave some sex, i would get away with things and people would leave me alone. if i got connected with a male, i had to have sex with them no matter what because thats the only thing people want from me (this is how i have been thinking all my life). even when i was a child, i believed that if i did sexual favours for adult males, it would be okay and i would get treated good. its really fucked up, right? i still need therapy because i have a lot of work to do with myself, and i have to learn that sex is not a chore and my value as a person is not based on sex. sex is supposed to be beautiful moment between to people. the intimate moment where people really show how much they love eachother. sex is supposed to be good and pleasurable for all parties, even if its a hook up or relationship. 

i used sex as an escape, from myself and my own feelings. the feelings my body get right after sex when you feel dizzy and happy for a while feels like a high for me and i wanted that drugged feeling, because i was tired of the anxiety and the trauma. its easier for me to have sex if i dont feel closeness with the other one, because being intimate with someone scares the shit of me. they see everything about me, my weaknesses, my soul and me naked. they see me at the most natural, and that scares me. fuck my ptsd and trauma for ruining my sexlife. im going to get better and take action for a better life. i suggest you start with therapy with your ptsd, because ptsd is hard and the longer you have it untreated, the worser it gets (it was like that with me). i went 6 years from the first rape until i got treatment. thats a long time and it has affected me more ways i orginally believed. 

please take care of yourself, you deserve everything good and to have a beautiful life. you deserve a good sexlife where you feel good about yourself and your needs. sex doesnt define your worth as a human being. sex is only supposed to be a good and exciting thing. please dont hesitate to message me if you need someone to talk to."

loveafterporn,ez3pman,t3_czsbk7,1567672458.0,"i had really messed up experiences with sex to begin with, and while being in trauma therapy now (EMDR), i learned that some reasons to why i got raped was because one of them used porn. i dont know how much, but i believe he watched a lot since he compared me to porn stars, and talk about stuff he wanted to do that he saw in porn. he needed sex the whole time and got really angry when i refused, and told me he could just watch porn or get another girl. since i refused to do some shit, he had to get it somehow. i have had to partners where i was learned that my pleasure didnt mean anything, my job and chore was to please them. i was never important. 

i watched a lot porn when i was 9-11/12 years old. i remember i cried a lot while doing it because it freaked me out, it was scary, but i had to watch it no matter what. i couldnt stop. my therapist and i believe i have been sexually abused as a child (body memories during emdr), due to how sexual i was as a child. how freaked out and disgusting i felt after i watched porn. i was negelected a lot as a child and believe this affected me more than i have realized before.

my whole sexuality was based on that i as a female only had one job, and that was to give pleasure to the male. my needs and boundaries never mattered and its hard to shallow the fact that this is wrong, and that porn has a lot of fault for making me think like this. im only 22 so im still young and able to change my ways of behaviour and thinking. its hard to enjoy sexual moments where my current partner focuses on me as well. its really disturbing, but im glad to learn how damaging porn is and how it affects relationships and sexuality. mine has been awfully affected by porn, both by me using it as a child and being with partners that used it a lot. 

im anti porn, but its hard to leave habits alone and i sometimes look up to watch, only to feel disguting and awful with my self. i know its harmful for me, but its familiar to me and familiar things are safer than unknown things. its not familiar to have a sexuality not affected by porn for me. my trauma therapist has helped me recover a lot, but i need to work on more complicated stuff still. its hard but its for my best. its hard to be in such conflicts with myself. i felt awful for this for years and disgusting, but a couple of weeks ago i started to tell her about how porn has ruined my life. 

its good to read about other experiences and perspective from other people. thank you for writing this post, i wish you good luck and take care of yourself. this sub helps me a lot to realize my problems and constantly teaching me why porn is awful. im happy this sub exsist."
TwoXADHD,ez3n5fi,t1_ez3dbtk,1567670830.0,"i used low hormone bcp couple of years ago and loved them. i skipped my period when i had to, and it was painless and didnt even notice that i had my period at all. that changed when i changed to long term birth controll. considering going back to those pills again if its possible for me. what part that scares me is if i forget, because i tend to forget stuff. going to talk with my doctor about this, thank you for your suggestion!"
TwoXADHD,ez3adra,t1_ez1zwd4,1567663683.0,"yeah i should do that too. i was a little bit hard with myself the last time, but now i know what its going to be like. good to see someone experiencing the same as me, thank you! :)"
TwoXADHD,ez3a2ij,t1_ez0m10b,1567663533.0,that sound really helpful. my period cyclus has changed a lot the last year so its hard to keep a track on it but i will try to do that. glad to hear that you found something that helps you! :)
TwoXADHD,ez3828l,t1_ez0mn10,1567662550.0,i used one low dose bc before and remember i loved it so much. i will try to check if i can go back on that if its possible. thank you for your reply! :)
TwoXADHD,ez37usj,t1_ez34aaf,1567662452.0,"i cant do that with the one i use now, but im considering changing it. just have to know my options."
TwoXADHD,ez37qm5,t1_ez1i0d7,1567662391.0,"luckily, my doctor knew this which makes me calm about the matter. its a shame that it isnt talled about that much, but i guess it is because adhd has been easier to put on boys rather than girls. thank you for the articles! :)"
TwoXADHD,ez0abid,t1_ez05vxd,1567633865.0,"i can see that and i have heard from others that birth controll can change a lot. going to look at my options for this, thanks for the tip :)"
TwoXADHD,ez085sk,t1_ez05v42,1567632770.0,"will try to check it up! used birthcontroll for 4 years, switched last year because i needed something else. i think i was a little hard with myself because it was so intense last time. now i know that can happen, which makes me better prepared next time. thank you for your reply! :)"
TwoXADHD,ez04are,t1_ez01imx,1567630381.0,"my doctor has joked to me as well, like saying ¬´who guessed you needed amphetamine to function, dont be worried if you feel speeded sometimes¬ª and so on, in a sarcastic tone and we are both laughing so i dont get offended at all. today, i asked her to get documentation for medication and driving, and asked if she would write that vyvanse is what it is, amphetamine. and she was like ¬´yeah the cops may not know about vyvanse and what it is, and that you only dont get amphetamine at the streets anymore¬ª and i just started to laugh, so did she. i really like her and i feel she takes me seriously. she told me today that she sees that i dont abuse my medication and therefore, not worried to try new ways with medication to give me the best way to function as possible. she always takes her time for me and i enjoy talking to her, and she is open to learn new things about vyvanse as well due to my weird experiences with it. im way too honest with her, but i think she appericiates that a lot and that i feel comfortable asking her and telling her.

i have heard about RSD, and im certain i have it due to untreated ADHD my whole life. without medication, i had all these fucked up thoughts and got anxious for no reason. no matter what i did, i wasnt good enough. i was my worst enemy. too hard with myself. i have felt my whole life that im different somehow, that im not like the others. my adhd makes me different, but at the same time, i have the possibility to do a lot and it can be my superpower as well as my worst enemy. my family is kinda med shaming in general, but have been more openminded due to my ADHD.  when i was on 50mg i felt different, the first day i took it was mindblowing. i took it early in the morning, slept some more and woke up with a quiet head. i was fully awake. i was calm. it was so amazing that i started to cry from happiness. i was also sure it was the right dosage, but i agreed to try 60mg since my doctor meant it could be better for me. she was right, 50 was good but after using 60, it felt like i really got the fully potential of vyvanse. the only anxiety i have is PTSD related, but im in therapy for that so im managing that. all those negative hurtful thoughts and the RSD has almost gone away after vyvanse. they only get back when the dosage ends for the day, but then im tired and going to sleep so i dont have the energy to careüòÇ

im glad you have a better life with medication, and if you need them its no shame taking them. i think my country are going to try to take adhd‚Äôers in the army now, to individually evaluate them rather than refusing everyone with the diagnosis. the most important thing we all should do is to try to accept who we are. we didnt ask for this life, but im going to live my life fully and adhd isnt going to stop me. if i need pills to have a brain that kinda functions normally so be it. i havent been the same without adhd, me being impulsive makes me say the most weird but funniest things, i make people laugh. my hyperactivity makes me energic, talk a lot and i can easily join a walk in the forest. my lack of concentration makes me have a short attention span, which makes me easily distracted and sometimes notices things or end up switching the subject in a conversation. it can be quite entertaining. i tried my whole life to be normal, but now i realize that i dont want normal, i want myself and my personality. who can define what normal is? a life with adhd is normal to me. to have a brain that works like trash has been my normal until i got vyvanse. sorry if this got long, my meds have worn off and i got so distractedüòÇ i found your comment reallt helpful! thank you for posting this!"
TwoXADHD,eyzxfvk,t1_eyzw4nu,1567626415.0,"i think she wanted to upper my dose at 70mg only for the days with period before she would try a fast release pill, to see how it worked on me. im supposed to take 60mg like usual, but only 70mg when aunty red stops by. i think most of the reason im skeptical is because im somehow scared someone will think i abuse vyvanse or that i only want the highest dosage as possible (no reason to think that, general anxiety i guess?). its serious medication and i want my doctor to see that i use them correctly and like i should do. however, i comfort myself by telling myself that im honest with her, i ask for appointmens with her so i can talk and ask her questions about all and nothing.

 i got told the same thing as you that 70mg is normal for an adult. the weird thing is that while i was uppering my dosage to find my match which is 60mg, i didnt feel this issue at all. it came when  i had been steady on 60mg for a while. im curious to see how things goes.  glad to hear you have the same effects as i have on vyvanse :) thank you for your reply! :)"
TwoXADHD,eyzv8po,t1_eyzuih2,1567625391.0,"birth controll pill? i use birth controll and have for 4 years, switched as well during that period. maybe i can change it again if this continiues? thanks for your reply! :)"
TwoXADHD,eyzuyp8,t1_eyztgge,1567625269.0,"last time i had my period, i tried to relax more and sleep more because i got exhausted. i worked and while i was effective at work, it didnt work at all when i got home again. i havw struggled with serious cramps in the uterus (?) and in my back since i started on birth control 4 years ago, which also makes me more exhausted and makes me need more rest than usual. i have tried to switch birth control without any luck there. 

back to the point, it was horrible, i believe i got more exhausted since vyvanse wore off too early, and my brain was tired from working like hell those hours. it made me explode in anger and suddenly turned to me feel extremely depressed which made me cry all the time for no reason. at work, i tried to take more breakes than usual. i will try to may have somw days off in the future when i have my period if its still like this so i can take more care for my self. i will try some different strategies to see what works or not. 

this is the first time i have been medicated for adhd, even if i got the diagnosis already in 2002. it definetly made my life a lot better, but im still new at this and want to have information about managing my symptoms. thank you for your reply, gonna think about this in the future! :)"
ADHD,eyzhukx,t1_eyzg5zx,1567618069.0,"we always describe ourselves ¬´we fulfill each other¬ª because since we both have the diagnosis, we have the same struggles but at the same time, different struggles. he is very bad at organizing, while im better at it. he is better to clean up after himself while im rather bad at it, to mention one example. he knows im a little sensitive, but he tries the best way he can and thats all i can ask for. 

youre right, good communication is hard to find. i notice with my self that i have improwed a lot this year, simply because i had to due to him having adhd and me having adhd. it was challenging to begin with, but im glad to see how much it has given me. its hard to find, most people dont listen, just wait for their turn. its a difference. i hope you also take care of yourself and ask when you need to. even if they hyperfocus, we are allowed to want attention from them. it doesnt have to be much at all :)"
