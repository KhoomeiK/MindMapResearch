We already created a great concept and got accepted by the festival organizers and they even promised us nearly double the budget because they loved our ideas so much.

And I feel like being in the middle. I also never had a relationship but about a month ago I developed some strong feelings for a friend. It was also the first time in my life I kinda got close to someone ever.

Over the years I always thought something was wrong with me and my brother(s) and I just recently stumbled over the terms demiromantic and demisexuality. For the first time I can relate to something. 
I never had a close relationship with my parents and while I think to know they love me it's something that never got spoken out. I'm not entirely sure but I think the missing open love and affection definitely had a bad influence on me and now I have serious problems to develop feelings for someone else and to deal with these feelings. It may sounds sad but I can't remember anyone telling me 'I love you' ever I always felt kinda unloved.

But it's hard to say what's really the reason why I am like this. Right now I'm fighting with this ugly combination of depression, social anxiety, demisexuality and demiromantic. If it doesn't work out with my friend I don't see myself in a relationship for the next years. This fucked up combination of mental health problems and orientations seems to make it nearly impossible to find someone"

For me it's about the pain I would cause in friends and family. If would kill myself right now I would make a lot of people incredible sad (which is actually a good thing if think about it, people care about me)
I don't know if I would view it as selfish if I had nobody in my life, probably not but I really don't want to find about this.

Thanks for your kind words you made me feel a little better today"

But seriously pls don't go on a rampage it will change nothing. 
I absolutely understand that you hate these people you probably have every reason to do so, but what about family or friends? I totally get that someone can give no shit about a stranger or let's say someone they don't really have a connection to or someone they hate. For me family and friends are probably the single most reason to not ever kill myself. I just wonder how you feel about it?"

depression,fgpv4m8,t1_fgpu0wv,1581012601.0,"I have experimented with a lot drugs in the past years. While I avoided the super hard drugs like heroin (or opioids in general, I know I would love them) or meth I have to say that for me alcohol is one of the worst.
Not just because of the effects, the hangover or because it's neurotoxicity but also because of the social status the glorification of hard drinking and the that it's available everywhere. Luckily I never got addicted to the point of withdrawals

Don't get me wrong alcohol can also be great especially if you have social anxiety but it's so important to not let it become a habit.

depression,fgpsxil,t1_fgprlsg,1581011379.0,"Yeah I already have my experience with that and you are absolutely right. Usually I try to limit my drinking but from time to time it happens that I will drink to much for a few days. It always makes things much worse when you feel physical like shit as well as mentally.

You know just like in the way of  'you can't love someone else when you don't love yourself first'. I always hated this platitude but I have to admit there is a deep truth in there. 
I just can't figure out how to care about myself in the long term. I can do it from time to time but it feels like I constantly loose interest in myself and have to start over.
I think the key is to find the right balance of caring about yourself and caring about others. As long as this balance isn't there it means you will suffer from it"

depression,ffqnd0h,t1_ffnk97d,1580139138.0,"Surrendering to the situation seems to be my only option at the time. It hurts a lot to let her go. Looking back she was like a gift in my life that kept on giving and now I feel ashamed that I can't give back to her. It's weird how long it took me to realise what a gem she was and is to me. Back in school she always encouraged me to be myself, helped me a lot with my confidence problems and now she made me accept my own depression and made me reach out to friends. She always was a good influence and I'm extremely thankful for her.

I see the point of your story and I'm sorry that you had to go thru this. It's something I have a lot of fear about. Like in both ways. That she could be the one going hard into depression and destroying a relationship or the other way around. But it hasn't come this far yet so it's just fear in my head about a potential future. And to be honest if it doesn't work out with my friend I don't see myself in a relationship for a long time. It's just how I am. It takes me ages to feel romantic and sexual feelings for someone else and my social anxiety and depression makes it nearly impossible to built these relationships. It sucks because I'm craving for love and affection and I'm sure it's part of the reason I'm depressed but maybe life finds a way some day.

Pulling the trigger on this message feels like some fucked up balance act right now. But I think I will wait some more and I hope that you are right and at some point I feel when it's the right time.

I'm still pretty young so I don't know how much it means but I feel you are much more wise then you think."
depression,ffnfxk9,t1_ffma8da,1580065383.0,"Man you really know how to touch someone's feelings, I have tears in my eyes. This is the most kind and warm hearted response I ever got on reddit. 

It really helped me what you wrote and I feel like I know what I have to text her. I really like the part with keeping the door open forever. Your message to Jane is nearly on point in how I feel about my friend, thanks a lot for this.

I just don't know if it's already time for such a message. Everyday I still have this hope in me that maybe tomorrow she will text me. But I can feel how this hope is slowly eating me from the inside. Letting her go won't be easy but I think soon I have to do this otherwise I will not get better.
She told me she will move to my city maybe in the start of february, so maybe I will just wait another few more days till my last realistic glimpse of hope died and text her then.

Another shitty thing is that I fear about her well being and mental health. From what she told me her relationship doesn't sound good for her mental state and I feel like it's also part of the reason she feels depressed. Her family supports her but also seems to have some obvious toxic aspects. 
All this makes me worry that isolating herself and being surrounded by all these people will not do her good. I know I can't do anything about this but it creates this feeling that letting her go means betraying her and leaving her behind without helping.


Thanks again for everything you wrote. I hope that you can figure everything out with your friend and that Jane will get in contact with you again. You really are a kind soul."
depression,ffm4pa0,t1_ffivv3j,1580048493.0,"Man thank you so much for this, I have read your response maybe 10 times now. 
I think trying to keep the door and my heard open is what I want to do. Like you said not being judgementel plays also a huge role, I know how hard it is for her and even thru she played with heard and really hurt me I can't judge her for that.

I hope so much that you are right with the ebb and flow part. Over the years it happened a few times that we didn't had contact for a few month. Not because something bad happend or so it just happend and we then would find each other again. Maybe it's like this again. I still don't understand how she can do this to me but actually that doesn't really matter. I know her pretty well and I know that shame guilt are things she will feel a lot about this. I don't want her to feel this it makes me fear that she will never reach out again to me and it makes me feel guilty for making her life even harder.

I know that's a lot to ask but do you have any advice about what I could text her? 
I want to be honest about the way I feel but I also don't want to hurt her or make her feel bad about this at all. I can see that she still reads my texts so maybe the right words can built the path for a future with her. Be it in a relationship or as a friend, I don't care she is important to me and a beautiful human being. Loosing her completely would create some dark place in my mind I can already feel this deep sadness building up inside of me"

dysthymia,fcxjs0a,t3_ejcotb,1578064659.0,"For me I think it has a lot to do with perfectionism and anxiety of failure. When I decide to learn something or start a project or whatever I really want to do my best. The problem is that this attitude is extremely energy consuming. So when I feel like I don't have the energy to do something up to my standards I will often not even try it. Failure is something I really dislike. I think I learned this as a child when my mother was screaming at me for not doing something the right way or for not knowing how to do something. It was always easier to just don't try anything, so this way I wouldn't fail and don't get screamed at or shamed. 

I feel like I'm slowly learning that failure is a major part of life and that it better to fail than not to try. Anyway I still have to work on this a lot"
