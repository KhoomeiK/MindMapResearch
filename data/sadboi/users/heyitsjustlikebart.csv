I made a little slip layer as well. Both the slip and top layer had a 5” slit (I simply didn’t connect the tulle into a loop). I sewed ribbon around them to make a V. Then I sewed ribbon all along the top and included a 12” strip extending from both edges so I could tie it. The ribbon is too slick to hold, however, so I will be replacing those strips with something else.

Works great!

myog,fgd0u73,t3_exn0zk,1580677944.0,"How I made it:

Machine: Brother CS-6000i

The following dimensions are of the finished bag. Don’t forget to add seam allowances!

Unrolled total bag dimensions: 12.5” x 21.5”

Rolled bag dimensions: 12.5” x 16.5” 

I used 2 identical rectangles for the front and back, both about 12.5” x 16.5” unrolled. I attached everything to each side before sewing the right-sides-together. 

To the front, I attached 2 D rings sewn into strips of cotton webbing. Sewn, these strips came out to be about 4.5”. These D ring are what the clasps hook onto. As you can see, I sewed all but the D rings themselves completely in place. But before sewing them down, I sneakily placed the edges of a front pocket beneath them. The distance between the webbing / the width of the pocket opening (same) came out to 5.5” exactly. That’s it for the front.

On the back, I pinned and sewed my clasps and handle. I should have also attached my straps at this time, but I didn’t so I had to go back and fix it. For my clasps, I attached them to cotton webbing, including strap adjusters. At their most extended, the *sewn* cotton webbing is 8.5”. It takes more than this to attach the hardware and the strap itself however. I believe I had used a 13” strip. The handle, curved, is 8” and I used a 10” strip. 

For the straps: To make one, I sewed two rectangles with a curved end, turned right-side-out and top stitched. They came out to be 2” x 14” (with the 15th inch sewn to the bag and hidden). Then I sewed a 30’ strip of webbing to the middle of the strap, aligning the tops of the pieces (so that 15” of cotton webbing extends from the bottom). I sewed 3 lines to attach. 

Each of these pieces extends from 11” up on the bag, with an inch of each sewn down in a square with an X across. The handle is curved around and there is a little more than 2” between the ends, with 1” of each sewn down. The clasp strips are an inch away from the handle on either side, and the shoulder straps’ webbing strip aligns with these. (Double check that everything is facing the right way since the clasps will stretch over to the front.)

Then to cover the ends of these pieces, I topstitched a piece that was the same width as the back piece, and about 3 inches tall. Careful, because you will be sewing through 6 layers at a couple points. I also added a 5.5” anti theft zipper pocket to the back.

I attached the zipper to the top of the bag and top stitched. I pinned all the straps to the middle, out of the way. Then I sewed, right sides together, the bottom piece onto both pieces to effectively create a loop. To make two little D ring connectors, I used 4” each of cotton webbing, looped it through the rings, and sewed several seams to close them and prevent fraying. I pinned these to the gray 1.5” down from the seam. Remember that you are sewing inside out, so the D ring will be within the bag when you sew, not sticking out. I sewed straight down the sides, being careful to line up the seams as well as I could. No need to leave a gap since the top is a zipper. Then I sewed two 3.5” seams to make a triangle in order to square out the bottom of the bag. Attach the strap and strap adjuster, looping through the D rings and sew to secure. Done!"
