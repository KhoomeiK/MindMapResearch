Advice,fkenjtj,t3_fhzrwb,1584116860.0,this happened to me my freshman year last year with my ex the best thing i can advise you to do is not to get angry and show you can be angry and if you want get revenge i suggest you donâ€™t do anything donâ€™t talk to people about it just let people ask you if this happened or they question you about it. and most importantly make sure you keep the story the same because you say you didnâ€™t rape her so with that tell the truth and donâ€™t talk to the deans or police without your parents there.

Bass,fk0bv8q,t3_ffnfm3,1583751419.0,if he likes music so much try to get him to develop perfect pitch. Not so heâ€™s a good musician but for the ability to listen to a song and be able to play it from memory. it would help learning music theory

Advice,fjew5gu,t1_fjevqrl,1583279330.0,Heâ€™s been suffering from depression since high school thatâ€™s why he started to drink and with him he doesnâ€™t talk much as is. is there any sighs of him getting physical worse or more dependent on it
Advice,fjevyab,t1_fjevm3i,1583279222.0,i was never going to yell at him because i know that has never helped anyone. If there anything i can do to make it easier for him because i canâ€™t drive but my parents know and will hope. When heâ€™s drunk he gets angry very easily and iâ€™m worried i might do something that will make him angry.
