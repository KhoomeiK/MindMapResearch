However, that is besides the point. Even if objective reality does exist it cannot contain any information as to the existence of some moral value. A moral value is something which is decided upon by the subjective individual. We have numerous examples of societies that believe in female castration, of societies that don't believe in death. There are endless examples of people in the world who see things differently than you do.

Reason is an important part but not the only part of finding out what one should do, you're saying that survival is necessarily ""human nature"" but is it?

Elon Musk asserts that you need people to make stuff making a very broad strokes argument about how we should re-consider how our civil rights are being infrigned. Look, I'm willing to give you eating and shelter and basic subsistence as civil rights but the absurd idea that going to work in a state of emergency is a right is something I'm not going to give.   


So let's think about what your argument is since it isn't about what Elon Musk said. You're saying, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that the long term death toll of unemployment will exceed the death toll of corona-virus? How do you know that? We know very little about what the virus is capable of and given we lack a treatment the decision to just start co-mingling again may be pre-mature.   


I also think we need to consider what specifically it IS about unemployment that causes these deaths. You know it's very news journalist of you to bring statistics into play and kind of sneak your own agenda about what they mean. SO let's actually take a look shall we?   


""Unemployment was associated with an increased risk of suicide and death from undetermined causes. Low education, personality characteristics, use of sleeping pills or tranquilizers, and serious or long-lasting illness tended to strengthen the association between unemployment and early mortality."" 

Okay so in this part that YOU quoted, (and by the way this article is VERY old, anyhow).  
We can clearly see that death is from undetermined causes, naturally you lead us to assume then that, well given the title of the article that it means it's unemployment that's got these folks down, while apparently not reading this:

""Low education, personality characteristics, use of sleeping pills or tranquilizers, and serious or long-lasting illness tended to strengthen the association between unemployment and early mortality"" red flag.

Could it be the case that unemployment is a symptom of a larger problem, that while unemployment does tend to exist among those that commit suicide that maybe there's something socially happening like, I don't know, lack of availability of jobs or lack of access to education and the healthcare?   


Okay so now here's where you say ""aha"" point proved Coronavirus is this factor increasing unemployment therefore increasing deaths therefore potentially outnumbering the deaths from the virus itself. Wait though! Are you not missing something there?  What happened to all those other factors increasing the likelihood of suicide and death? Surely unemployment isn't the only factor here. Is it possible that being forced to work in an environment where you are risking your life just by coming in will also cause an increase in stress? Is it possible some people will avoid going to work at all costs to avoid getting sick? What about the elderly population or the already sick that all but require clean and safe work environments to work?   


These things are all connected together, there are multiple factors which lead up to and cause unnecessary deaths.  I hold that we don't know enough about what the decision to open back up will do to make that decision. So what's the take-away. Well to quote the article we're addressing in the conclusion you opted to not include for reasons unknown:   


*""Conclusions.* An increased risk of death from external causes implies a need for support for those experiencing unemployment, particularly susceptible individuals.""  


A need for support for susceptible individuals.  


Now, article 2: Yale:  


 “Employment is the essential element of social status and it establishes a person as a contributing member of society and also has very important implications for self-esteem,” said Brenner. “When that is taken away, people become susceptible to depression, cardiovascular disease, AIDS and many other illnesses that increase mortality.”   


What about when people seek out purpose in life and are denied. There is also a direct correlation between happiness and the job you get to do, as this quote suggests. So my question becomes who are we re-opening the country FOR? Is it for the low wage, already high risk impoverished person making barely enough to survive or the guy just sitting in his living room going crazy because he's bored with nothing to do? Depression is a very serious issue, I don't doubt that I am an active member of the mental health community. I support anything that will help people cope with this situation, but we have to ask as matter of ethics at least, what is the population most susceptible to the spread of disease? Who are the most vulnerable populations and how many of them would be relieved to go back to their 7.50/hr job?   


There's nothing wrong with working those jobs by the way, but those jobs often pay too little to keep a person well and alive. It strikes me as profoundly hypocritical to protest not being able to go to work yourself when you're condemning by doing so everyone else to also return to work in the light of a deadly disease armed only with statistical data from the 1970s."

The fascists would have you believe that their government is going to do something great by reopening the economy when really what they want, what they know, is that now is a golden land grab opportunity and it can be worked on the backs of the most vulnerable.

I will say this again, just because you think you have a right to work doesn't mean you should and just because I have a right to stay inside doesn't mean I can if you don't. If we all stay inside and collaborate for a little while to deal with this situation we can get out of it, but if we all just break pace while some of us get to go back into the workforce, get lucky and not get infected, or die by doing it then you're really imposing an oppression on people that just have sense enough to stay safe.

We don't have a right to impose a moratorium on work forever, but we also don't have a right to cripple people too vulnerable to fight the disease. It's like the hypocrites that go on T.V. from their house and say ""I'm willing to make the sacrifice"" all the while knowing they never have to leave anyways. Yeah it's easy to say you're willing to go back to work and it's your right but that imposes an unfair advantage which will permanently cast some people into poverty. That won't happen of course because people aren't going to risk their financial security to not work and stay safe so what WILL happen is that EVERYONE goes back to work and we start spreading the disease like glitter and it just never goes away and way more people die.

I am advocating for people to reconsider their choices before they fight regulations their representatives, who they elected, put into place as a precaution to protect them.

Autocracy is absolute power and as it stands we don't live in a fascist nation, but there are fascists out there. People who will stop at nothing to gain power so as to seize the means of production and therefore rule unfettered. If you believe that's not true when was the last time someone really had an actual choice as to where they can live, and what they can eat? It all requires capital, capital is freedom, capital is power and it's the only thing that makes free folks free anymore."
Capitalism,fpup8ix,t1_fpu0nzu,1588919232.0,"> Mortality rate for the impact this extended shutdown seems to be having on our food supply chain? How about the 20% unemployment rate? Or the significant increase in calls to the suicide hotline?

Interesting, so what you're saying is that people need basic subsistence like food and mental health care, because I have news for you if so? 

In two months we've had 70,000 deaths and 1.29 million confirmed cases. Is your position that it would actually be better now taking more risk at this point? See because I have this nagging problem with your long term thinking here, you seem to be assuming this thing will go away. 

Fauci has already said it's possible that the virus will return even stronger in the winter time. So what then? Do we just muscle our way through everything until all the vulnerable people are dead and our healthcare system implodes because more and more healthcare workers are disenfranchised and stressed, and the systems we have in place are strained by the public that thinks keeping safe is infringing on their civil liberties? 

We don't need to pretend like we don't have the infrastructure to keep critical system afloat for a little longer while we actually wait for AT LEAST some type of treatment. It's been two months. 

My contention is that you don't have a right to work if your right to work will kill someone, because that's murder. We can speculate all day about what the long term economic effects will be, but we KNOW that if left unchecked the virus will have massive and long lasting impact on the global economy as well as destroy countless lives.

1. Elon Musk says that ""public health officials are saying this"" with no sources provided beyond that for his first argument that COVID-19 cases are being overblown by primary cause of death and Joe Rogan just accepts it.
2. Elon Musk claims that we should put massive weight on anything which is a ""threat to our civil liberties"" to which I would respond ""how big of an infringement is wrongful death on our civil liberties?"" if I deliberately coughed on Elon Musk knowing I had a potentially deadly disease whose rights are being infringed? Elon Musk's, or mine when the cops show up?    

3. Elon Musk claims that 'people think that if someone has more stuff they just took more from the horn of plenty' and ""if you don't make stuff, there's no stuff"" attacking some distant strawman that no one is building and presenting it as if that has something to do with COVID-19 relief checks which went out to a temporary stop gap to keep poor people fed while they couldn't work.   
It's true that if you don't make stuff there's no stuff, what has that got to do with keeping people safe from other people? What has that got to do with keeping people alive and well so they can actually contribute to the economy when the pandemic is over?  


My analysis of this video is that it's random clips from a youtube podcast from a man who would allow people to ""choose"" to go to work despite the intrinsic risk that presents to the greater population, and despite the deaths that would result from such a decision. Elon Musk in this video as presented has 0 sources referenced, is making 0 truth claims but rather just far reaching arguments to an indefinite opposition which may not even exist, and is being blatantly biased towards economic and business interests.   


If everyone is dead, sick, or worse the machine STILL grinds to a halt. That's why this is an emergency, not the common cold threat level he seems to think it is. Long term it's better for us to deal with the virus then restart and be careful doing it than to rush reintroduction of people into the workplace so that this months profit margins don't dip.   


So, I maintain. Why should we listen to Elon Musk who is definitely biased, has not presented source material for these claims, and is not uniquely qualified in any way to make judgement calls on the best procedures during a pandemic. He hasn't an ethical leg to stand on, the shoddy civil liberties argument is about as effectively convincing as a Westboro Baptist church's argument about their right to protest the funerals of military personnel.

I was emotionally and physically abused as well by both parents, and my sister too which is why I understand that sometimes forgiveness isn't always possible and it can definitely seem like there is no reason for a behavior.

I just consider myself an advocate for people and I think simply thinking about the possiblity that something is up with this kid is worth while. I would love it if I could reconcile some of the differences I have had with some of the toxic people in my life and so if there's even a chance I believe it to be worth while for everyone.

I don't know the situation though. I think sometimes we don't always realize the extent to which our behaviors affect people, and we aren't always willing to admit our contributions or potential contributions to someone's self image. I also don't think we always understand how something like sickness, death, and massive traumas affect different people. 

Many people who experience death for example grieve differently and I imagine the same is true with how we deal with stress. When it comes to OPs description it sounds a lot like my sister, closed in and unwilling to participate in family affairs. It wasn't until we realized after her shitty father's family stole money from her and abandoned her basically that she started developing all these phobias.

The reason she doesn't want to participate in family affairs, learn to drive or move on with life or be what we would consider a ""better person"" is because she in constantly navigating an anxiety minefield where almost anything could be a trigger at any time. She's triggered by playing certain games or watching certain movie etc, she has tics and generally shows physical symptoms as a result of psychological trauma. Much of this is genetic and related to other causes as well but I won't get into that. 

I don't know that OP's sibling is affected this way but my main point is that stress can manifest itself in surprising ways, which to me is enough to give pause and consider.

Punishment can be effective when it's clear what the reason for the behavior is but if it's something amorphous like being a shithead it might not stick or worse make the person feel entitled to some type of their own retribution.

BreadTube,fpjx12x,t1_fpj7o4s,1588683185.0,"I would like to contribute two things:

1. &#x200B;

It may be true that there is some perceived fundamental miscommunication, but we don't know if that has anything to do with language or simply an attitude of a person. There's not any doubt in my mind many alt-right people have built this entire universe of explanations around why the left is the left, and that most of it was simply invented for the explicit purpose of rhetorical annihilation. To the right wing fascists I'm imagining there's not some desire to hold hands ""but gosh darn the left just doesn't like us"". Many alt-right personalities are specifically being influenced by an emotional drive to win some imaginary battle for ""freedom"" etc etc... In the US there has been this war behind the war for a very long time.

2.

The philosophy of language isn't an non debated topic in and of itself.  For example there are some who might argue that even among people of a common ""language"" there is always some miscommunication. Even when we abide by these maxims it may be the case that I simply don't know what ""petrol"" is or I don't necessarily understand the implications behind this said ""cooperative principle"" meaning I could be entirely lost about what some person expects me to do in a situation where I am out of gas.

I might think the person who says the garage is down the road is trying to tell me to walk up there and call someone to come tow my car to my house. Granted it's a silly thing but there are more complex situations where it's not so simple. People play these sorts of language games all the time and depending on their background information and how they were taught they might have entirely different sets of principles which guide their language.

I once knew a person who expected their SO so understand when they said they were going to bed that the SO should come to bed as well. Sure between those two that might mean the same thing, but then consider the third party in that isn't necessarily going to be receiving the same message, for one because they aren't the SO and secondly because they aren't necessarily aware of this unspoken principle.

More importantly consider that in both cases it's absolutely necessary for the hidden meaning to exist between the SOs and specifically NOT anyone else. We need this hidden languages between us to develop friendships, to communicate in a secret way as not to alert suspicions, etc...

Semi-related rant/tangent:

It's just so complicated that we HAVE to debate what words mean, we have to figure out what is appropriate and what everyone can agree on and so even the definition of a word like privilege needs to have some basis for it's use in order for everyone to agree with it otherwise you're asking for a plethora of mis-information being spread everywhere. Half the left using privilege the other third advantage and the last third having no certainty about what to use.

The reason the right can be so directly challenging and consistent with their language is because the right doesn't need to discuss what's right or wrong to accept someone into the fold. On the right as long as you express some anti-immigrant, pro-gun, etc... sentiment you're in the club.

I truly believe the problem with the left is how hard it is to be helpful and feel like a part of the community. There are so many groups within the humanitarian coalition that are totally comfortable gatekeeping, and perfectly happy leaving people on their own to figure out for themselves what's right about being on the left (ba-dum-tsh). It's not necessarily a bad thing in good times, but when you need to motivate and move forward and take control of the cultural zeitgeist it helps people to not be left in the lurches, be welcomed with open arms for any interest in giving a shit about people, and generally not looking down your nose on anyone no matter what their walk in life.

The human, familial, thing is to accept everyone equally and have a program where people can be integrated into the left without meeting resistance of entry for being either ignorant or misguided. I'm not saying we swing open the flood gates and just let anyone say they're on the left but as a community we need to be more open minded.

That SAID, I also believe the left doesn't really exist. The left isn't really as defined as the right is, there are people within the coalition of humanitarians which have widely different views on fundamental principles surrounding speech and other human rights. The alt-right is a war machine designed to inoculate people with ritual practices and simplistic if then logics. Until there is either a more defined left or the right can be blurred with enough of it's own discourse I don't think I see there being much of a shift from the two party system we have.

rant,fpg6cls,t3_gd68vr,1588595494.0,"I doubt this person is past the abuse, see because the problem is so many who are abused are taught to hold that shit in, to stuff it on some shelf and forget it. Unfortunately in some cases those same people are taught to release their anger and hate onto a target or onto some proxy and that's the least likely thing to help you get past your rage and  sadness. Fighting and screaming at people, punching things, shooting guns and other violent things people call ""catharsis"" are all just emotional amplifiers. It feels really good to get catharsis for a moment, so you have the momentary high where all that shit you've been holding back has been seen and so you feel seen, but only for a minute.

Few people talk about what happens after that, that you reabsorb all that frustration and rage and anger and sort of put it back up on the shelf, and you keep repeating the same process over and over but what happens like any drug? Eventually the catharsis doesn't feel as good anymore, so you have to use more and more often and you have to get that high more and more until you just become someone who feels constantly justified by their rage, you don't know who you are without it and maybe you even think it's a good thing to consistently display or have at the ready. You BECOME an abuser, it's a poetic homonym.

What is the real source of frustration? You need to let that out in a way that people can actually read. Rage is so chaotic and fleeting that when you let it out that way it just becomes loud and unpleasant noise, we need to learn the language of vulnerability and that skill is just something you have to work on developing yet so few people see it that way. Vulnerability isn't a weakness, in fact it's a skill you need to be a truly functional and whole person. Anger and rage have their uses but there is no natural reason to hold them in, it's fabricated.

Truthfully people don't want to hear about other people's problems because they are already so, almost to the point of physically, blocked up by their own baggage. Baggage which makes hearing vulnerability a challenge which people are ironically too weak to handle because the anger makes them unstable and confused. People will, when faced with something too big for them to address, enter fight or flight and then that's it; the pot boils over and they need to use and abuse again in order get back into control.

We need vulnerability to study the drug, to understand where it is affecting us and how so we can start to administer some sort of action plan to stop abusing the drug. We need to spend hours in peace and calm to isolate the source of frustration such that if confusion does set in and fog our clarity we have something like a beacon to reach out for in those moments to truly regain control of our bodies and minds."

I don't know if I agree with your view on suicide here. I think there is the possibility of a net gain, since it's impossible to predict the future to a degree which is certain. I don't know if there is such a probability of life being bad or good since both of those ideas are tied to many variables, some of which can be subjective and depend on the experiencer.

It's certainly possible that any one variable in the equation changing could bring about a cascade effect at any time. Sure no one should be forced to endure the drudgery but there's also a part of me which thinks there are a lot of steps between drudgery and suicide.  If I knew I would die tomorrow I would probably break my usual habits and try to live a life as best I could in that time. Do things I never would have while under the impression that I would need to work for a living.

At the end of the day it's quite stoic, the worst that can happen is that you die and if that's the case why force the issue?  Let your actions take you as  far and close to death as you want, burn out even if you like but to immediately jump to death just seems like a wasted opportunity to try something you know you won't be able to afterwards. A lot of times when I'm suicidal I will think to myself that if I live enough life for too long I'm going to accidentally convince myself not to do it. Sometimes that happens, but if I do convince myself to live I usually do so because I feel better about something or at least differently. I figure that so long as death is possible it's not so bad just doing whatever or trying whatever until I'm convinced otherwise by some other source of information. At the least of these sort of level I can give my life up for others, if I'm morally opposed to the drudgery or something I can try to reduce that for others before I go.

I guess what I'm saying is sometimes it's not just black and white, you know? It's not just drudgery and happiness, there are a lot of emotions to feel which can drastically alter your mood and I'm just not so sure it's not worth while to ride those waves out. If your life falls into hell so be it, see where it goes, you WILL die, that is something which cannot be avoided and so in a way that's empowering because it means you don't have to sit and plan it out. In the end your death is coming so there's nothing really to lose from life?

Yeah you can feel pain, but is pain a bad thing? It certainly has it's uses, it teaches you about things, it provides feedback to what you like and don't like. Pain is just a human experience and insofar as life is, pain is just a part of the thing until we die.  I can use my pain to show others what I have learned, that is worth something. You really have to add these factors to the equation of whether it is logical to kill yourself or you're being selective which is a sort of cognitive bias. In my opinion there are a lot of life multipliers we don't tend to think about which makes different outcomes very possible.

I never would have thought I could achieve certain things I have and I have had traumas which I never thought I would. Ultimately and without and sort of pushback I have to give in to the idea that at least I don't know what will happen."

Violence can be effective in silencing people but we aren't any better for it, as I said even revolution has it built into the name. It's just revolving doors, one opression leaves breath for the next.

Do we need violence? Sure. Sometimes violence is an only option, but nothing about that makes it a good tool to use, just an effective one and there is a world of difference between the two.

Edit:

And I should add the only reason we ever have for violence is violence, once you throw the first punch at that point you've crossed a boundary which just does no help your cause.

wholesomememes,fp1i09m,t1_fp189fc,1588236191.0,"Justified and valid, yes absolutely. Hatred just isn't usually a strategic emotion to act on, and please notice I say act on because obviously we can't help feel the emotions we feel, and sometimes even when we have a choice we just need to choose to feel them. In the cases we choose hatred it should be a tool. Hate should rarely be against a person in particular and always against inhumane and oppressive ideas, this in the form of rising to meet better ideals and to that end violence and silence are seldom a strategic response.

For one silence is a crime perpetrated by the people who pretend to be innocent, it's the same as neglect. If we aren't speaking out vehemently against bigoted and oppressive ideas as well as contributing to discourse productively we aren't in the fight at all and that means oppression wins.

Secondly violence is a call for destruction of everything, like an atom bomb, it destroys the discursive battle field and turns it into a real one. Violence can accomplish the goal of killing specific oppressors, but that's a victory won on the back of something so toxic it will corrupt the next to rise up into oppressors in an endless cycle.

Unfortunately hate can be something which is hard to control, violence and silence, and rage these things can corrode a person to the point of apathy, nihilism, and cynicism which is self-dominating. No need for an oppressor when your mind is fogged by your own darkness."

I mean it all just seems so random, you know I could be exactly in the middle of the curve when it comes to IQ and that might as well mean the same thing as being in the middle of a curve that shows how flamboyant I am compared to others. 

Unless flamboyancy produces some result which is either favorable or not favorable the data means nothing, right?"

I've found myself (as a male who identifies with many values found in feminism) lost in the world. I've found it hard to find community, ones which will accept me warts and all. 

On the one hand I never want to be a part of a community which hurts women and as such take active steps to try to avoid them. I also find it difficult to explain to some of my friends and family why I want to be an advocate and so there is this great tension which feels isolating. 

On the other hand I have had my fair share of outright accusations and gossip and all sorts of negative feedback from male and female feminists who are on the more extreme ends of things, and if not directly then behind my back such that I feel like an outcast among people I want to stand with.

I'm opposed to any sort of anarchic market, there needs to be sensible and affordable options for people without access to get what they need to be alive. I'm willing to deal with the price of soda being whatever it is so long as we also have absolute means for people to get things like insulin.

Capitalism,fo6mlbt,t1_fo6bfwd,1587562422.0,"""So i will adress some points here, collective ownership doesnt work on large scales. Lets say you and i own a car together and we share it that works. But lets say the whole block collectively owns the car, now its not about sharing it anymore, now its about taking it before anyone else takes it. So collective ownership just doesnt work. ""  


Well who says a whole block has to share a car? Let's say we collectively own the factory which produces the cars, we know that in order for everyone to get where they need effectively we need to produce X amount of cars. With collective ownership we don't need to rely on everyone being able to afford the cars in question, we can just make all the cars we need.   


I feel as if you're assuming some type of poverty associated with collective ownership, but that's not necessarily the case. Innovations in technology and science have rendered mass production quite achievable. I don't deny the value capitalism has had in the past in producing mass wealth but it's possible something better is ahead of us which promises even fewer people go without the essentials in life.

""So in the case of private property being the basis for production let me paint you a scenario. In the first scenario you own a plot of land and what you grow there is yours.

In the second the plot of land is collectively owned and everyone who collectively owns it can grow things there and/or take crops from there at will.

In which of these two scenarios will you actully grow crops, in which of these two will you work hard and produce as much crops as you possibly can?""  


I think that really just depends on the relative compensation society has deemed appropriate for the labor I do. Let's not get away from the idea that private property can and does exist in systems outside of capitalism. I don't necessarily think collective ownership of everything is a great idea, while it's at least seemingly viable as I outlined above I do think you're right to say there is value in private ownership.  


I think it's a good thing that people can earn the extras in life, does that mean every single resource must be negotiable on a free market with no regulation? I don't think so. I think there are enough resources globally that we can have both collective farms AND private farms. One collective farm, (which by the way is real there are community gardens in many urban areas where food deserts are common) can feed everyone who can't necessarily afford what the private ones sell.   


It's not so much about removing a market as it is developing it to be more humanitarian.   


 ""People are of course not only motivated by monetery rewards, but it costs money to produce things, it also cost time and effort to produce things, and people hate losing money, they hate to lose time and they hate to put in an effort without reward. With collective ownership all the lazy people will just go and take what they need from the plot of land while you are working very hard to grow crops there. So you stop doing it. This is pretty much what happened duing collectivisation of the farmers in china which was part of the great leap forward, and in a very short timespan 45 million people starved to death. [https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/01/20/145360447/the-secret-document-that-transformed-china](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/01/20/145360447/the-secret-document-that-transformed-china)

Collective ownership doesnt work on large scales, it works on very small scales only.""  


You know I don't actually believe in laziness, as a concept it's never really worked fundamentally because even lazy people do things. Very few ""lazy"" people sit in a room alone and do literally nothing while their body wastes away. ""lazy"" people need to eat, they usually require some sorts of stimulation. There is room to hypothesize that perhaps the people we consider ""lazy"" simply don't have the appropriate motivation. I know many people who have anxiety and obsessive disorders that give them great challenge in meeting the expectations of certain types of labor. Some people are ill equipped to handle the stresses of nuero-typical lifestyles.   


I don't really see any problem providing basic healthcare and subsistence needs for these people because very many ""lazy"" people have latent value which is never allowed to see the light of day because of a pressure chamber that demands they do things which drains their mental capacities. Einstein sometimes wouldn't bathe, DaVinci never met with any real success until long after he died. Capability and social value don't always manifest in a free market economy, very much progress has been produced by other systems and economies suited for others of a different type of mind.  


I don't think there's very much value in treating people like numbers, statistics, or using prescriptive labels and writing them off. I think some areas of life deserve more observation and research before we make a damning determination on the overall value of a person. It may be the case that some people would steal and take advantage of a collective system but that's true NOW. There are people who steal from private industries, I can go to pirate bay right now and steal pretty much any movie I want and never spend a dime and that's within a free market system.   


I don't think the free market does very much to prevent people who really don't want to work from  taking advantage of people that do.  It's just that in one way you ignore the people that really want to work hard but are unable because of other economic or personal circumstances."

The mental health community must support one another in whatever ways we are able as often as we are able, so that means I would be a hypocrite to participate in gatekeeping mental health.

In popular culture there has been this whole movement about believing women and I think that is an absolutely vital function of feminism and the same is true for mental health but for everyone. Believe everyone when it comes to what they say about their own personal struggle, because we can't be in their skin."

&#x200B;

>Another great thing which supply and demand did, was that it told us what to buy within reason, we got market prices which contains a lot of hidden information. If the price of fish goes up either the demand for fish has increased, or the supply of fish has gone down, it has for one reason or another becaome a more scarce resource.Now without any central planning we could together organise our economy, and we know what we should choose to buy given the chance, buy the cheaper product (between two different products ofcourse) because now you use less of the resources that are scarce and might be better spent on other things, and you buy the things which is in good supply, that doesnt suffer from scarcity to the same degree.

Many people are content to completely use up every natural resource there is, in theory people would think ahead and say ""maybe we shouldn't keep making plastic with oil from this country"" but they don't. It's a nice idea that people would operate based on supply and demand, but unfortunately when supply of a resource drops and companies are forced to charge more, sometimes people just don't buy the product at all so you need more coercive tactics to stay afloat.

Another hidden fact about supply and demand that it isn't always taken into consideration the lasting effect the extraction of natural resources has on local economies from whence the resource comes. Many times large international companies can afford, again as we discussed earlier with Coke, to simply undercut a market in a particular region and force local businesses in an already struggling economy to collapse. After a business has eliminated the competition they can come in and start essentially socially engineering the people of that area, they can force them to become dependent on the company and instantly that's a solid source of revenue and the resource they need to continue to produce. Look at how cities offer tax breaks to certain companies or certain legal loopholes to bring their business over? Dependency is the natural result of a lack of competition, and if a corporate entity becomes just like the state in terms of control of natural resources I would submit to you there is no effective difference between that and a totalitarian regime.

Lastly I will respond to your closing statements:

>So then why doesnt other systems work: without free markets you dont have supply and demand nor market prices, without private property its dangerous to go out and work. So less is produced, we waste more and we cant use our resources efficiently (with a planned economy that controlls prices, which is one of the reasons why Venezuela is doing so poorly, a planned economy)  
>  
>So you always end up back at Private Property and Free Markets, otherwise things gets worse for everyone but mostly the people at the bottom.

&#x200B;

I would say we can see the effective result of any system where there is a power imbalance the people that suffer the most are the people at the bottom. I'm not a rock, I can be swayed but I think I would need a little more to be convinced that capitalism does much of a better job at preventing power imbalance as any other system. I have always seen capitalism, particularly free market capitalism as a means of reproducing a controlled anarchy. In some sense it makes sense that the markets should even out at first glance and everyone should, with enough energy and time be able to take some share of the market for their own to sustain themselves. 

In theory the entire planet has enough resources for everyone, so we could say ancient tribes could have indeed split up the resources, and simply traded to their hearts content and everyone benefits but that isn't the whole story. Trade has always happened in human history, but so has war and famine, fanatical leaders and people who are always trying to edge out their competition so that they can finally feel a sense of security anyways if not a sense of absolute dominion. The aspect of domination and winning and conquering all has not gone away over the history of all of humanity, as such any system which replicates the conditions which does not seek to specifically reign in that part of the human ego is doomed to create power imbalance.

I can sometimes get behind when people say ""capitalism is the best we have"" sometimes. If the best thing we can do is capitalism, fine, I don't know that I agree with that but capitalism is far from the meritorious victor of history. There are good and very ugly things, and I think we should always strive to progress to something bigger and better."
Capitalism,fo4mjtq,t3_g5h9kw,1587507141.0,"Understand that I am responding with respect here, please don't interpret anything I am about to say with an angry or condescending tone: Please note I am responding to the entire post which means I will be responding in two comments.  


P1 (of 2)

I want to first respond to these statements:

>""...So now when you could actually leave your belongings for some time you could go out and be productive and try to sell those things on the market.""

I don't really see where this is a good case in support of capitalism in particular, it makes a good case for property being protected by the state in general, but that could exist in many sorts of economies. Private property is just another way of saying ""things"" which you can exclusively enjoy without state intervention.

1. ""[Socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) is an economic system characterized by social ownership and control of the means of production and cooperative management of the economy, and a political philosophy advocating such a system. ""

In socialism private property not only exists, but individuals collectively control the means by which that property is produced meaning if anyone needs something in particular because it was destroyed, stolen, or repossessed the people have the power to replace it immediately and we can even give people a RIGHT to owning certain properties in the first place. In a capitalist system it's true there are rights which protect what you own but there is no promise that what you own will always be worth the same. I would argue more people lose what they have paid for in a Capitalist system from repossession by banks and debtors and there is less reliance on the law to repossess from the unlawful, the state can respond immediately to put you back on your feet and get you producing again.

>""It is also the reason why people are productive at all, because if you dont get to keep what you create you dont work unless someone is paying you to do it.""

I think many capitalists underestimate people's sense of civic duty and personal motivation, I also think there is also a misunderstanding of what truly drives people to create. People are not only motivated by monetary incentives, if you can make someone's working or home environment equal what they are putting into the economy precisely you don't need capitalism you just need a smaller economic curve from bottom to top. We might of course need to reevaluate what types of jobs are truly essential and therefore who gets the highest qualities of goods and services for their work in but it's doable.

If as a janitor I come home to a reasonable home life and time to do what I'm passionate about do you really think I am going to complain about doing the janitorial job? It's a matter of proportionality, motivation can come from more than just monetary incentives, it can come from state produced incentives as well.

Additionally, I  would like to mention that not everyone particularly WANTS to sell what they produce of their own volition anyways. Many artists work jobs just for the money to do the art they want to on the side for free, or for their own amusement. I don't have any incentive to sit on Reddit right now and talk to you, no one is paying me to type all of this I just like to write and converse with people so where's the free market there? >!(low hanging fruit to talk about the development of Reddit in a capitalist society, there is no evidence to suggest it would not have developed elsewhere under other circumstances).!<

Next I want to respond to these statements:

&#x200B;

""Free markets, simply means that the state doesnt interfere with the market you are free to produce and trade whatever you like at whatever price you want.""

That isn't exactly true, while yes in a free market you have the free choice to sell your shoelaces at 1.2 million a piece it doesn't always make it a viable option. It's a bit like saying to a man in prison they're free to leave anytime they want, provided they understand they're going to be shot as soon as they leave the premises. The free market brings with it potential for exploitation and underhanded tricks used by the largest and most influential businesses, and indeed this is what we have seen. As Coca-Cola I can afford with all my extra capital to eat the cost of flooding the market for long enough with cheap enough priced product that everyone will buy my product and subsequently shut down smaller businesses in the process, businesses who simply do not yet have the capital to produce a cheaper product for as long and bring to the market. Once I have eliminated a large enough portion of my competition I can begin raising prices again and remake the investment ten fold with my new customer base.

One other issue is without a lot of competition I can afford to continue to increase my profit margins by spending less money on quality control and sometimes even bring unsafe products to the market. State intervention at some level is required, regulation at some level is necessary, and it's just matter of how much is where the debate truly lives.

>""This gave rise to supply and demand taking control of prices which was amazing. Now we wasted less resources and fulfilled more peoples wants and needs. Less people go hungry and we throw away less food.

As I stated above I don't really think supply and demand can truly exist on it's own, it's entirely possible within an economic system to take advantage of having extra capital to eliminate competition. Capitalism has more to it than simply the free market. Waste produced is a matter of cost, efficiency, and overall the attitude of the person producing the product. If there are no immediate ramifications for me throwing all my plastic in a ditch somewhere and it costs less than building a recycling plant it only makes sense for me to choose the cheaper option, even if it does end up costing me later on for all I know that will never happen. People might demand your cheap plastic product, and you might have much more resources to invest in a larger supply as a result of being able to cheaply dispose of your factory waste. Resources are limited, but some resources are effectively limited by nothing. There are some resources we could use for millions of years and never run out, but which might produce a byproduct when used to create certain products that will create an endless source of waste as well."
