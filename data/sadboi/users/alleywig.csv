I saw your halloween marriage proposal and loved it. You two are absolutely adorable, and I can relate to the awkwardness of the whole thing (getting the ring out) when I proposed to my wife. I got cancer (in remission) the year of our wedding and took a month off from chemo to get at least something poking out of my head for the pictures.

I would enjoy life. Make every day halloween. Get married early in a graveyard (sorry for assuming). Cry every day and then pop a xanax and smoke a bowl (just personal experience here) and do what makes you happy.

I survived the worst year of the flu (2017-2018), that killed over 62k in the USA, while recieving treatment. I did get infected in November and transferred to the ICU for a day- but I made it. You can make it through this immunotherapy stuff to extend your life.
