ADHD,fmy0ihk,t1_fmy0ba1,1586475556.0,It's a good idea but I kind of never leave my house. I share a car with my husband so I don't have access to a car to go anywhere because he works 10 hour shifts during the day. I also hate sports except for martial arts. I did martial arts for 14 years but now I can't afford to go to a class and my apartment is too small to practice in. But thank you for the suggestion.

ptsd,fl3kzt6,t3_fly9i5,1584788884.0,"Such good advice. I suffered trauma as a teen and I think I was too young to understand the full impact of the trauma. All I know is that I also suffered trauma as an adult. Pre-adult trauma, I was maticulously organized and on-time - perhaps as a way to deal with teen drama. Either way, I've had to come to terms in my later adult years that I'm not that maticulously organized on-time person. And it's hard. My most formative years were shaped by being on-time and organized. But maybe that wasn't even me to begin with. So... I've had to let go of this teen version of me - that I'm not even sure was real - for this new older adult me. It's hard."
ADHD,fkgzroq,t3_fi1qbs,1584182420.0,I can't tell you how many times I've been so proud of myself for making it to class on time that I missed that whole class because I was focusing on my achievement.
sleep,fg32m82,t3_ewlvbq,1580467502.0,"THIS HAPPENS TO ME TOO. Sorry for the all caps, but everyone looks at me like I'm crazy when I talk about it. Like, my dreams are so vivid and so crazy that I feel like I'm awake in them all night. Unfortunately, I still haven't found a solution. My doctor sent me to a sleep specialist, but the sleep doctor just said, ""There's nothing we can do for the content of your sleep,"" and he sent me on my way."

ADHD,f7sf18w,t3_dxfmvd,1573994116.0,"I always think of it like this: ""Is this something I actually want to get done?"" If yes, ADHD. If no, lazy. Either way, I try to come up with a way to make it easier. Like... If I need to eat and get the laundry done but I only have enough mental energy for one but both need to get done, then I'll order food so I have enough mental energy for laundry. The financial cost is worth not spending the mental cost on making food so I can get the other thing done."

mentalillness,f6yrsu2,t3_dtsxum,1573293641.0,"Just stay away from typical conservative Evangelical Christianity (normally Baptists, but I won't say they're ALL bad... Just mostly...) unless you want to hear a lot of ""if you just pray enough, it'll go away"" or ""you're just not being good enough for God to take it away"". Now, Anglican or Orthodox Christianity is the way to go. I'm Anglican and often go out for beer or coffee with my priest and we have reality based discussions about mental illness and how it relates to faith. That's been really helpful. I will say religion gives you something more eternal to grab onto and something outside of yourself. It can help you see the purpose and reason to it."

RantsFromRetail,eyk1fxk,t3_cx30wb,1567134054.0,"Having this problem right now. Or, similar. I'm a graduate student and working on a thesis. When I was hired a months ago, I told them I could only work 20 hours a week. They've been scheduling me consistently for 26. That may not sound like a huge gap, but it is when you're reading 200+ pages a week and trying to get a 100+ page high academic paper written. I let it go for two weeks, since I had just been hired, but kept reminding my manager that I'm overscheduled. He said my next schedule would absolutely only have 20 hours. Checked it yesterday and I was scheduled for 30. If they can't schedule me for the availability I was hired for, I'm quitting. A retail job isn't worth the thousands of hours I've put into my education."
