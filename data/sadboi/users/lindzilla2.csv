No one would be okay after putting the pieces together and realizing that is who it was (your friend.) Your story I think I was meant to come across...I lost my cousin Gage he was like my little brother when he was only 16. He died by suicide and shot himself in the head. I developed PTSD because his body was not fully dead and they life flighted him to the children's hospital. Seeing him like that made me think this thought... ""What is one last thing I can do for him before we pull the plug?"" üò≠üò®üòñ I decided to go to my grandmother's house where he lived and clean up his blood myself. I have PTSD from that too. I know my story is nowhere near as bad as yours but I wanted to share that I'm here for you and you can get through this slowly but surely.

This medication definitely makes us weak in the sheets. It's either that or be psychotic for me. My partner would much rather me be like this than psychotic. I guess you have to base your life around other things too. (Not saying you don't.) We just are so different from ""normal"" people. I understand the way you feel completely.

I have my therapist and paychiatrist on my side. I often wonder if I'll ever be the same person again. These meds are necessary for me not to go super suicidal but they drain me as well.
