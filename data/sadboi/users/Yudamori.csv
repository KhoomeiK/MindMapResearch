But for the record I've never had a teacher look at me with this mentality even once. I've been lucky to have great teachers who always went above and beyond (except for 2 of them, but whatever) to take good care of and prepare their students for real life. That goes for both private and public school, by the way. They treated us with respect and love, and genuinely cared. 

More times than I can count, I was snuck a school breakfast or lunch by a cafeteria employee, more times than I can count a teacher shared their food with me or ordered a pizza to share so that I could have something to eat. It wasn't just teachers, sometimes classmates would pack extra lunches and bring me one from home, exactly the same as their lunch, and we'd eat together. When I'd come over after school sometimes their parents would make extra and pretend it was by accident and then offer me some. I didn't ever call them out on it but I knew what they were doing. It literally kept me alive during the times when my family was having money issues but didn't qualify for financial aid / free lunches. 

When considering candidates for financial aid / SNAP / TANF / Free Lunch in the US, the applicant's income is looked at but not their expenses, so if you have a middle class income but tons of hospital bills that use all of it up, for example, they often won't accept you into any assistance programs."

The school I went to had a lot of rich/celebrity/political kids attending so they didn't get it at all.

TooAfraidToAsk,eywpfnt,t3_cz5axy,1567534857.0,"That's really something to talk to your partner about. I have friends who get really irritated when sex lasts a long time, and friends who feel kind of ripped off when it doesn't, and I'm kind of on both sides of it where sometimes I just want to finish and other times I really want to take my time with it. Everyone's kind of different with regard to sex, so if this is someone you're looking to be with more than once you might just want to have a conversation.  


If you're worried about it sounding awkward, you can word it less like ""hey do I finish too quickly during sex"" and more like ""I'm working to make sex better for both of us, and I'd really like some input when you're able to let me know. I'm not always sure if more or less foreplay is best, or if sex would be better if it went on longer. What would make it better for you?"" and just also include ways that it can be better for you as well so it doesn't seem like you're putting them on the spot. People often don't talk about what they want during sex, and are sometimes used to their partners not even caring what they want, so it can be hard to bring up or talk about.

  
If you phrase it like you're looking to make the entire experience better for both (which you are, making your partner have a better time will make you have a better time as well, since you seem like the kind of person who cares how they're doing.) I've never had better sex than when with a partner that can give me some constructive criticism during, like ""push a little less hard than that"" or ""that's starting to be a little too intense"" or ""maybe switch to another area because that area is getting sore"" or ""that's really nice, do that more"", things like that. You pick it up along the way.
