StackAdvice,f82in6y,t1_f7be706,1574191984.0,"Just ve read it thanks for reply. Started takin aniracetam with omega-3, gon do it for 21 days and after switch to piracetam for 3 weeks also. I already can tell that short term memory is recalling while brain fog disappearing. Could NSI-189 be helpful there? I can get some in my country right now just wondering if I should."

depression,f4uy69c,t3_dlp6ws,1571833008.0,"Memory loss is mad real. I've always had brilliant memory to the point that I could remember any text with just rapid look at it. So yeah depression was building up slowly so at first you don't notice, then you do notice but in yo head shit is just not worth it to remember. And the last stage (as4me) whereas my friend is telling me the sentence, I do listen carefully and BAM! what you just said ? And the worst nightmare of mine was speaking to people while trying to be in line of their thoughts and you couldn't. Around 8 month ago I stopped ssri and all medicine. Memory is coming back  and you are feeling so good that it's not gone forever. Still not comparable to the memory I had before but we re going on the right way!
DEPRESSION WILL NOT DIVIDE US !!!"

Nootropics,evdsx6v,t3_cjaw5b,1564446651.0,"Have been injecting it for 2 weeks straight last year. And I can say it kinda was, some sort of light head was there 4sure but dunno if I was tired. Btw as far as I know it's good for brain injury recovery/stroke recovery. As for my problem of abusing alcohol while having PTSD it made me feel better, memory came back, mental clarity and better mood overall"
