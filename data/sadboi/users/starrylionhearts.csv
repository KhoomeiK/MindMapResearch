TeachingUK,fpx8we3,t1_fpx7qqv,1588977933.0,Thank you. Thatâ€™s actually really good advice tbh. I know they donâ€™t expect you to be a qualified teacher when they interview you because thatâ€™s what training is for but if youâ€™re used to just overthinking stuff youâ€™ll get worried about it anyway.
TeachingUK,fpx5hv6,t1_fpwv5ge,1588976040.0,No I havenâ€™t tbh. I can relate to what you and others have said on this thread though and the whole interview process does worry me.
TeachingUK,fpv27tj,t3_ftuizm,1588932226.0,How did you manage at the interview because I feel like I can relate to this and I just feel worried about it?

lost,fnwq1s5,t1_fnwpxwl,1587323199.0,I wish I lived in the lost island world. I think it's literally one of the best fictional universes.
lost,fnwpxwl,t3_g46yl3,1587323137.0,This scene is honestly beautiful and it's what makes this show so different to everything else. I love this post lol.
YABooks,fnss03f,t3_g3bf93,1587227684.0,The Raven Cycle series 100% thereâ€™s nothing really like it and I love it so much.
TeachingUK,fnsmysr,t1_fnsly31,1587224897.0,Well I actually haven't done that much stuff since the last application. I applied in August and I've only done one thing that I can relate to teaching.

progressive_islam,flk47l5,t1_fljy40c,1585233573.0,"Well from what I have seen on this subreddit, I assumed that the majority were welcoming and accepting of the lgbt community. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything wrong with supporting people who are apart of the community, I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a sin in that. 

People can still participate, but I think they should be more respectful. This place is also open to different interpretations including the one where the act of homosexuality is not a sin. I think that is also part of being progressive too. Thereâ€™s probably a few interpretations to that passage that is used in support of homosexuality being a sin."
progressive_islam,fljlrr7,t3_fp506l,1585218062.0,"A lot of people here are accepting and supportive of the LGBT community. You donâ€™t have to be here if you disagree with that, I mean to the people who are against being LGBT."

TeachingUK,fkeefso,t1_fkee46h,1584111462.0,I know theyâ€™ll still need people on their courses but I just donâ€™t know how it will work out. Iâ€™ll contact some of the other universities and see. Thank you.

TeachingUK,fke64u5,t3_fhzmjr,1584106140.0,"I have contacted a university to ask them as well, but Iâ€™m just wondering if anyone knows anything about this."
lost,fj6bgw4,t3_fba2ej,1583065956.0,"I would love to see Ben and Hugo back, I feel like there was more to the relationship between them that could be explored. They could bring new characters in so itâ€™s not the same thing as the original show too, but I would really love to see something new from the LOST world."

Anxiety,f4zocg2,t3_dm63gs,1571912266.0,yesss and sometimes it's always the same moment that i keep cringing over and even after like 7 years i still cringe over it.
DoesAnybodyElse,f240sy7,t3_dbrd42,1569942302.0,"yess, same like they were so huge much bigger than us and it just amazes me that they existed. they kind of feel like some mythical creature lol."

progressive_islam,f14e5fw,t3_d6zii3,1569173167.0,"Tbh how I see it is that wanting everyone to be treated equally, regardless of their differences in sexuality or gender etc., is fighting against oppression or discrimination. And there's probably a quote in the Quran that says that oppression is wrong, so if you want to go against homophobia or misogyny, you aren't doing anything wrong. I also like this subreddit too, it's nice."
DoesAnybodyElse,eztue93,t1_ezr4erb,1568138858.0,"I read somewhere online on reddit and other websites that your feelings/thoughts/emotions are valid during or before your period. Your response to them may be exaggerated due to hormones, but they still are valid. So just try to think of it like that."
DoesAnybodyElse,eznwto2,t3_d1h41l,1568012799.0,I think its a frustrating feeling too because I feel this and then upset because it's not a real emotion and I want it to be real.
DoesAnybodyElse,ezll6yr,t1_ezljxjo,1567978146.0,"Same and then if I realise its due to my period, I get like dissapointed too because I feel like I wouldn't care that much for other things if I wasn't close to starting it idk. I sometimes also overthink my feelings and its hard to understand why I felt a certain way."
Anxiety,ewy5t4b,t1_ewy5qkl,1565875334.0,but its like on a lot of reddit threads not just this partiuclar one

TeachingUK,ewv0w5y,t3_cqax7c,1565796174.0,I'm not a PGCE student but I have seen a few books on amazon that might be useful. There's one called 'Succeeding on your Primary PGCE' which seems good.

TeachingUK,eud6wi6,t1_eud5r7p,1563704780.0,Because I never got round to making a proper one and probably didn't think it would be much of an issue until now.
TeachingUK,eud6ocq,t1_eud5rqp,1563704419.0,Thank you. I literally worry about everything so now I was thinking like what if it doesn't match perfectly. I'll just make sure that I can do the one in my passport I guess.
TeachingUK,eud5pdp,t1_eud5nbn,1563702856.0,"So you don't need to like put the same one you put in your passport lol? Because the one I did in my passport is not a scribble, I wish I made it simpler."
TeachingUK,etms6e5,t1_etl84px,1562967245.0,Thank you so much. I'll just put volunteering or volunteer then.
