LetsTalkMusic,etuj1tn,t1_etuhdey,1563213604.0,"Yes. Sorry, I phrased that wrong. I think what i meant by ‚Äúbad vocals‚Äù was ‚Äúnot the easiest on the ears‚Äù or maybe just not using perfect singing technique. I don‚Äôt prefer one over the other, in fact i think that sometimes having vocals that sound too perfect can make a track more boring. I think singing with technique has its benefits, such as sounding more smooth, whereas a track with ‚Äòrougher‚Äô vocals can evoke more emotion"
LetsTalkMusic,etuiip4,t1_etudybq,1563213294.0,"Agreed. I think that there‚Äôs not necessarily a better way to sing, just different ways of conveying emotion. Car seat headrest is amazing.
