I watched the first minute or two, but then I switched to do my math homework instead.

I still kind of hate myself now."

That was early last fall semester. Thankfully I've been clean since then."

I've done psychological self harm by watching triggering videos on Youtube despite the fact that I knew it was triggering. As for physical, I bit my hand in hopes of peeling off the skin.


What defines self harm is basically in the title, whether that involves bullying yourself or physically bruising or cutting yourself."

In fact, my roommate told me she could not see them after a week had passed. Sometimes I don't want to see them myself. A thing I kind of like is that my scars are pretty much invisible whenever I'm washing my hands or taking a shower.
My scars are at least two months old, so I haven't seen how they behave with my eczema yet. They might completely disappear then. I don't know."
