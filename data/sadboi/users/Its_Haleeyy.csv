There's no way of telling right of the bat what medications and dosages will work for you.

I had the opposite issue, Aripiprazole was the first one I tried and I had horrible side effects on it. I'm hoping I have better luck with Wellbutrin."
depression_help,fivaoag,t1_fiv9zd3,1582756978.0,"> Can you give me a more focused summary of what you're going through? Your age as well, I think that's important.

I got diagnosed with Bipolar II about 4 or 5 months ago. I was mostly struggling with hypomania but that's been better since I started Lamictal. 

The last 2 ish months I've been struggling more with depression. It was really mild at the beginning but it's been slowly getting worse and I'm not really sure what to do. 

I'm going to a new psychiatrist at the beginning of April and I'm gonna see about getting on medication. I'm looking for a job change too, I know that's a big part of it too. 

I'm also 23."

depressionregimens,fil28dd,t3_f8fdrb,1582492093.0,I've never been on Prozac specifically but I have quit an antidepressant cold turkey before and the withdrawals were horrible. I would suggest slowly tapering off of it.
depressionregimens,fikpy9m,t1_fik5qyr,1582485030.0,"> Do you still feel the need to add something to address hypomanic episodes then?

I don't think so, my hypomanic episodes seem to have stopped for the most part. I still get mild episodes once in awhile, I think I could maybe up my Lamictal a tiny bit but I don't think I need a whole nother medication.

> The only exception seems to be Bupropion, since it doesn't act on seratonin.

I was thinking about seeing if I could get on this for my depressive episodes."

Yes.

Do you know if it's all antidepressants in general or specific kinds? (Antisychotics, SSRI'S, etc)"
depressionregimens,fibdp9r,t1_fib8mkt,1582319799.0,"> Yeah, don't quit Aripiprazole cold turkey. They should have known. Why were you even put on that?

She said they add it with mood stabilizers because it's supposed to help more apparently. 

> How does Lamotrigine work for you and what dose are you on? I'm taking 200mg and it helps a great deal.

I like it so far. It doesn't help as much with my lows but I notice a huge difference for the highs. I'm probably gonna try to add another antidepressant but I'm just nervous to because I had such a bad experience on Abilify."
bipolar2,fiamsz0,t3_f7di0i,1582304274.0,"I had an awful experience on it. It made me super restless, more anxiety, loss of appetite, masked expression, I just felt like a zombie. 

My psychiatrist also told me I could quit it cold turkey if I didn't like it and I ended up getting such bad withdrawals that I had to take two weeks off work.

EDIT: I also got blurred vision as a side effect too."

Thankfully I found another psychiatrist nearby that takes patients without needing to have a therapist in the same clinic so I have that to fall back on too. They're booked out six weeks so I think I'm gonna call and make an appointment there just in case - I'll have had two or three sessions with the new therapist by then and can decide if I wanna keep seeing her or go back to my original one."
