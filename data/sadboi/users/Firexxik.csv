Some days it gets lonely. I think if all I have lost and it makes me sad... but I do t miss them. They were from a different time in my life and I am just going to keep moving forward.

There was a time I was 300# and gladly did nude modeling. Then I lost 120# and had the worst self image issues of my life. 

Here‚Äôs the thing... don‚Äôt focus on getting people to like you. Focus on doing you to your fullest and best enjoyment. Educate yourself. Make yourself healthy. Make yourself happy, active and doing things YOU love to do. 

Also, find a therapist. They aren‚Äôt there simply to fix the broken but to help you navigate growth, lose and self improvement. 

You can‚Äôt expect anyone to like you if you don‚Äôt like you.

Personally, I LOVE myself. I‚Äôm FAR from perfect. I have more mental, physical and emotional scars from a past that I did nothing to deserve. But I LOVE me enough to work each day toward happiness, good health and my own convictions. 

I don‚Äôt worry about trending fashions or material things. I focus on my own beliefs, values and sense of right and wrong. 

Life is still pretty lonely but I have a few friends now that I really enjoy spending time with and a few friends that I never get to see but I know they are always with me in spirit or when I need to talk. 

I have lost so many friends in my movements and growth that I no longer expect anyone to be around forever... I have learned to enjoy people in the moment, leave kindness in my wake and owe nothing to anyone. 

I promise you can find happiness and social fulfillment. And oddly enough, it all comes from working inward.

Huge congrats on losing 80#! That‚Äôs amazing and to hell with anyone that wants to call you a 2.

Say on a normal Monday you work 7-5. 

5:30: wake and shower
6:00breakfast- eggs avocado toast, sit off screen, cook eat and wash up the dishes.
7:00- start work. Make sure to take breaks as you go. 
10:30- apple slices and peanut butter 
12:30. Lunch time. Salad with chicken, half sandwich with soup. Anything light and not carb heavy. Fiber and protein are good.
5:00- have a snack. Meat and cheese, or fruit. Maybe half cup of trail mix. Yogurt and granola. (A bit of healthy carb is good hear to boost you after a long day... plus.. now you will take your walk.
5:30- brisk walk around your area
6:00- hit the books. Start your studying (Tuesday‚Äôs and Wednesday‚Äôs skip this and go to the gym)
7:00 dinner. Healthy portions. No more than a cup of pasta or rice... keep this veggie heavy with a good portion of protein. Dairy is good because the calcium and magnesium will help tone down the body for the evening.
8:00 one more hour to study
9:00 Wind down for bed. Have a cup of sleepy tea. Stretch the body and settle in for bed. 

On a weekend-
Wake up 6:00- shower, breakfast. 
7:00- do chores. Laundry, dishes, clean your apartment etc.
10:30- snack. High fiber/ protein. 
11:00- groceries for the week
1:00- lunch. Enjoy it! Sit out side, go to a cafe, picnic... just get out of the house!
2:00- spend the rest of the day doing what you love (active rest- go be busy, hang with friends, laugh!)
9:30- wind down for the night. 

Sunday

6:00 wake- breakfast.
7:30-12:30- study. Do projects/ papers etc. don‚Äôt let assignments fall behind. Take a do it first and out of the way approach.
12:30- long lunch. Make something good. Share with friends... enjoy the relaxed time
2:30- back to projects
4:30. Go for your walk. Make it an hour... listen to music... take photos... breathe.
5:30- snack
6:00- wind down for the evening. Watch a movie or just relax. 
7:30- dinner- keep it light- avoid carbs 
9:00- bedtime... 

I hope that helps. 

You don‚Äôt need to plan every detail of assignments and such. Just block out a consistent routine.

There is little to no time for social media and web surfing. You are on a mission to make dollars and get your degree. That‚Äôs going to take a few years of focus. This isn‚Äôt life forever... but it is your current mission.

getdisciplined,fqu6zm7,t3_gkz9n2,1589653239.0,"Honestly, strict routine and lots of time management.
Schedule your week. Plan things one hour at a time and even schedule meal times. 
Don‚Äôt eat at the desk. 

Wake, shower and breakfast. Do a 20 min stretch and energize routine. Nothing fancy. Just get your heart rate up. Minimal carbs at breakfast. 
Make sure you get up for 5-10 minutes every hour and walk around and stretch. 

Do you work 10 hours a day 7 days a week? Because that‚Äôs not reasonable with school for anyone.

Schedule a 30 min evening walk daily.

Plan breakfast, lunch, dinner, and 2 snack breaks daily. Make it a moment in your day that you step away from all tasks. 

Join a gym and plan 60 min of weight lifting 3 days a week. No need for more... this will show you results. 

Study times should be one hour at a time and a little each day. Again, take breaks. 

Sleep consistently with fixed bed times and wake times. Sleep is vital to retain information.

Keep water at your desk. Sip all day long. 

Living by the clock is bland but it does keep your day in bite size portions so you don‚Äôt have to constantly panic about your mountain of tasks. You just need to focus on the next hour. 

Make sure you plan one day of active rest each week. This doesn‚Äôt mean sleeping in or being lazy on the sofa. This means doing something fun and avoiding stressing obligations. Hike, sports, socialize, window shop, meal prep. Be sure to do you... keep your hobbies and interests active. 

Start simple and build on it. 

Keep away from caffeine, sugar and alcohol. These cause highs and crashes in energy and the goal is to be consistent.

Posture will be a constant consideration... make sure you get chiropractic care."

Are you BOTH giving equal effort to finding middle ground? Or is one person always conceding?

Is there a middle ground to be had? Example. My ex husband and I split because he wanted kids that were genetically his, I believe in adoption over procreation till there are no more orphans to love. There was no compromise here. We split on good terms. Now I mentor and he has a son. 

My current relationship he‚Äôs cluttered but clean. I‚Äôm organized but care less about germs. We both do our part to make things cleaner.

I guess it depends on what you consider a red flag. There are dangerous and toxic traits that should not be ignored. Temper issues, jealousy, cheating, lying to name a few. These can be over come if both parties are willing to do serious work to heal and become better people.... but this desire must be independent. The individual must want to be a better person for themselves otherwise when things get tough... it will breed resentment ‚Äúi changed myself for you‚Äù should never be said in an argument. 

I guess the line is when you no longer can grow together and when only one person is making effort... then you are beating a dead horse. Therapy can go a long way but only if both parties truly want to find common ground and make things work."

Take the opportunities as they present themselves. Say yes more than no. Don‚Äôt let fear of ‚Äúnew‚Äù hold you back. Try anything interesting once. (Barring toxic things like drugs and crime of course).

You are doing just as you should by being supportive in letting him know he doesn‚Äôt need to buy your love. However, it feels like this is less about you and more about his own self confidence and worth. 

My advice would be to allow him to buy the ring and be supportive by being enthusiastic about it regardless of what he chooses. 
Keep your grandmother‚Äôs ring to pass on to your children when the time comes. Wear it to remember her and wear his to honor the efforts he put in to it to ensure he would be worthy of you and the family you will build together.

Many men and cultures still value being a provider as a sign of worth. To disregard that may be a slight against his beliefs and a symptom of an inability to understand and value what he values.

If the nurse messes up something that big, she Will lose her license. We are their assistants and until we are nurses ourselves, our jobs are very important and we must do them as they are assigned. It is possible that the patient had been showing those signs previously to your seeing them (even if just recently) and the nurse is aware and steps are underway.

If you feel this is truly a bad nurse who is letting their patients die and should be under review for potential loss of license... then absolutely report them.

selfimprovement,fq65fc6,t1_fq64p3e,1589124860.0,"Drink as much as you can, even before you feel thirsty.""  That's been the mantra to athletes and coaches for the past three decades, and bottled water and sports drinks have flourished into billion-dollar industries in the same short time. The problem is that an overhydrated athlete is at a performance disadvantage and at risk of exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH)--a potentially fatal condition.

Dr. Tim Noakes takes you inside the science of athlete hydration for a fascinating look at the human body‚Äôs need for water and how it uses the liquids it ingests. He also chronicles the shaky research that reported findings contrary to results in nearly all of Noakes‚Äô extensive and since-confirmed studies.

In Waterlogged, Noakes sets the record straight, exposing the myths surrounding dehydration and presenting up-to-date hydration guidelines for endurance sport and prolonged training activities. Enough with oversold sports drinks and obsessing over water consumption before, during, and after every workout, he says. Time for the facts‚Äîand the prevention of any more needless fatalities.

I think this is shedding light in a far different context than the OP is talking about. Remembering to hydrate throughout a day is a far different concept than endurance athletes over hydrating. 

I agree that athletes and others could overhydrate easily and lose electrolytes in the processes. (Has to teach this to my BF this summer when I noticed early signs of hyponatremia in him on a hot day. He easily goes thru 1-1.5gal of water on a hot day) this would be more inline with your concerns. However, the average joe trying to remember to hydrate each day when many Americans will go hours upon hours without a beverage is a very different situation.

I would say melt a little bit of oil or butter in to a bowl of hot water. Drop some soap in question on to the surface. If the oil scatters away from the soap... then it should kill it with 20seconds of Washing.

If you do pay your own rent and become finacially independent of him and you tell him to leave you alone, you may have some legal course of filing harassment charges but this will burn the bridges between you and your father.

I know the pain of wanting a partner to share it all with but the theory is, the more you build your value, the higher your standards and the higher your value=find a partner that is of high quality and that respects you. 

Next, you will find your partner while doing the things you Turkey love for no reason other than you love doing them. This is how you find a partner that enjoys the same activities you do. 

So, as you can see, you don‚Äôt just sit around and wait like sleeping beauty, you find your perfect partner on your path to finding yourself. Only then are you strong enough to be independent, valued and able to hold up your half of a lifetime with someone.

I hope that makes more sense.

I do compare my bf to him... but in good ways. There are reasons we didn‚Äôt work out that don‚Äôt warrant a ruined friendship. 

We do not have a child together but he does have a son that I try and be an active ‚Äúaunt‚Äù role in. 

I feel very blessed to have retained my friendship with him.

I can say that I would 100% crash at his place and there is a 100% chance I would NEVER sleep with or rekindle anything with him. 

That being said, any time I‚Äôm serious with someone... I introduce them to my ex husband/best friend. Anyone that sees us together for an hour will see that there is NOTHING going on. 

I think it‚Äôs safe for you to express to your bf that you respect his current relationship‚Äô with his kid‚Äôs mom. That it does make you uncomfortable and you would like him to work together with you to help make it more comfortable for you. That you need time and extra effort to feel secure with him having that type of friendship and familiarity with his ex wife. 

Do not accuse. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to feel uneasy about such a situation and as long as you can be open about him maintaining that association with her, he should be willing to nurture a feeling of security with you. 

Make sure if you find things specifically that bother you about interactions they have that you address them in a non-accusing atmosphere.

If him spending the night bothers you more than his need to be there when his kid wakes up... then you need to weigh that out. Maybe crash with him, if it comes to a point that he wants to introduce you to his kid on that intimate of a level. 

There are work around a here and it doesn‚Äôt need to be completely right or wrong to be concerned. But it will take a very mature and gentle conversation and actions to make it work and grow.

It‚Äôs taken us about 3 years for my ex‚Äôs gf to warm up to me and my presence but even now we can sit and share a cup of coffee just the two of us on occasion and she even hugs me hello and good bye.

Oatmeal contains good cholesterol. The entire goal of good cholesterol is that it moves fat from your tissues to your liver to be burned, used, eliminated. Literally the fat exit bus. 

Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of eggs! The are quick, easy, yummy and a complete protein. Meaning it contains both the amino acids your body can make, but those that your body cannot make and must be consumed.

I would avoid the ramen. Notoriously filled with chemicals and sodium and yucky fat. 

Stick with Whole Foods whenever possible. Meaning ditch the temptingly easy one minute side dishes and chicken nuggets or even frozen chicken/beef meals. 

Slower cooker meal prep is fantastic if you can donate 2 days every 6 weeks to cooking. 

You can search online and find huge recipes for massive meal prep. I did this ONCE. Cost me $350 in groceries and made 40 one gallon bags of slow cooker meals. Fed 1 female and 2 hungry adult men each meal with usual left overs so... for one person it may last you like... 4-6 months. Plus, once the work was done and the bags were frozen all you had to do was throw them in the slow cooker in the morning and call it done. Then just add breakfast and fruit to your diet. Leftovers for lunch. I‚Äôm sure you can freeze in smaller bags and use small slow cooker. It was a TON of work and a TOn of food to prep and process but lasted forever.

nursing,fq1ybgo,t1_fq1pdwa,1589051134.0,"Vital signs are different on a patient that is a sleep vs one that is awake. Heart rate and bp specifically along with respirations. 
Beyond that, you risk the patient waking up mid process and if they are even slightly confused could lead them to be startled, confused, panic or even violent. 

It‚Äôs a tough call when you compare your human feelings with your clinical judgement. However, any time you are going to touch a patient, they should be awake. At least awake enough to hear you say you are there and going to be doing vitals. 

Rapids get called often on night shift because patients don‚Äôt arouse when attempts are taken to wake them for vitals. 

All that being said, a nurse may use clinical judgement to determine if vitals can be skipped if the patient is finally sleeping well, has been very stable or if they have had a traumatic day and needs the rest more than the record.

From personal experience I can tell you that I had a horrible experience at a hospital for a week and I woke up every morning to a needle already in my arm. The CNA didn‚Äôt wake me... they just came in with a flashlight and stuck me. I can‚Äôt tell you the number of times I nearly hit them, let alone jumped causing unnecessary bruising. 

This is a topic that is currently under medical debate, however, across the board it‚Äôs said to be better to skip the vital signs of the patient is doing well and stable rather than to take them without waking the patient. 

On the highest of extreme ends, one could find them selves in a mess of legal issues. 

If a nurse touches a patient against their permission, they can actually be charged with assault. Ensuring you have permission to lay you hands on your patient, even for something as simple as vital signs, without some recognition of approval from your patient (sometimes that‚Äôs even an affirming groan), you could find yourself liable. Again... that‚Äôs super extreme but no one wants to risk that kinda court case."

Seeking therapy to sort out all you have been thru and filling in the gaps of things you may have missed growing up would be a great idea! 

Therapy is not a sign of deficits. I started therapy 4 years ago to become a better business manager. The best thing we can have in this world is a keen sense of self awareness and therapy can really help you improve on that! 

I hate that there is a stigma around therapy. That suggesting it feels like an insult or partaking is like a disease. But the truth is, just like anything we do... it‚Äôs like going to the gym or doing physical therapy to improve ourselves. Think of it like a psychological mentor. 

I‚Äôm not one to judge. My numbers are up there and I started young. Always cautious and always clean but even the most meticulous people can catch something so... there is always that. (Cheaters suck).

But for this particular issue, I would say... have the conversation with him. If he‚Äôs truly going to toss you aside and judge you so easily for being honest about a number then I would say you dodged a bullet. 

You have learned to respect your body as a prize worthy of being saved for someone you choose worthy... next is saving your heart, assets and time for someone who is going to not only appreciate you for all that you are and how far you have come but be eager to grow with you in to the future and not look too coarsely on your past. 

He may be a good guy over all... but if he can‚Äôt over look your past to move forward... then you deserve better.

Well, because the sinuses are gory to trap all the filter stuff... also because they are narrow, breathing out in a sudden relaxation of the diaphragm results in blowing that mucus out and making your nose runny. It also forces pressure on the lungs by backing up the air slightly at the nose and increased pressure from a relaxed diaphragm. (Your breathe muscle).

So, by exhaling thru the mouth you can let air quickly leave the lungs without runny noses or increased pressure. This helps the body relax without instinct reflexes of increased lung pressure.

LifeProTips,fowjn3a,t1_fowj7dh,1588121076.0,"Dust mites ‚Äì sometimes called bed mites ‚Äì are the most common cause of allergy from house dust. Dust mites live and multiply easily in warm, humid places. They prefer temperatures at or above 70 degrees Fahrenheit with humidity of 75 to 80 percent. They die when the humidity falls below 50 percent.

explainlikeimfive,fowjhco,t3_g9z9mf,1588120986.0,"For orbit to happen you have to have two directions of pull. 

So, say you have a tetherball and you want that ball to orbit a pole. First, you need to tie that ball to the pole (gravity, a force pulling toward the earth). Great! But now, you only have one string pulling in one direction. So... it will fall to the pole and smash. 

So, now you need a second force. This force need to go sideways. Like, if you were to throw the ball. Now... if you were to simply throw the ball straight, it would shoot off in to space and never bend around the pole. See, we need both.

So if we have a string holding the ball to the pole (center force) and then throw the ball side ways (angled force) the two pull on one another and cause the ball to bend and swing around the pole.

This would be easier with crayons and paper."

LifeProTips,fowi6ks,t1_fowhrjp,1588120258.0,"Termites? If there are termites in your pillow, there are bigger issues. Also... everyone has dust mites in their pillow, mattress, blankets, and on their bodies. Fact of life."
Anxiety,fowi2in,t1_fowhov1,1588120194.0,"No problem. Sounds like you are off to a great start. 

I feel you on the caffeine... I work night shift and consume more coffee than food. 

Once you enact these practices you will find you are less tired, your anxiety may start to level out and over all health will improve. Beer belly isn‚Äôt just a sign of fat but a sign over over health issues... improve the diet, exercise and rest and you will see this symptom of deeper issues resolve. 

Yes... this is a mighty tall order to start under quarantine... but it is the road you must travel to reach yo goal. Just do it one step at a time... which means an apple instead of chips, fresh chicken thighs over nuggets and veggies over pasta. 

Good luck!"
socialskills,fowhp6t,t3_g9yjhc,1588119993.0,"It comes from a lack of self confidence. 

You worry you will be judged if the compliment isn‚Äôt received in the manner you intended it to be. 

Ex

You tell a girl ‚Äúwow! That dress looks great on you!‚Äù Genuine.

She responds with ‚Äúquit staring creep!‚Äù

Do you feel rejected, dismisses and less of a worthy human?

Here‚Äôs the thing. Her reaction to your compliment doesn‚Äôt change you opinion or your compliment. Understanding that her reaction is no reflection of your good will and only harms her reputation and character goes a long way to building that confidence. 

I have said many things both positive and negative and has people tell me to shush because someone might hear me. My response is always ‚ÄúI know what I said and stand by it.‚Äù That is confidence. Being self aware enough to know your actions before doing them and then the integrity to stand by them. If you are ashamed of something you say, the. Chances are you didn‚Äôt like the fact that you said it. That should stand true to someone‚Äôs face and behind their back. 

Learn to emit your beautiful self to the world and fear not the actions of others. Keep your grass green, you intentions pure and light bright and carry on with your beautiful ways. The right people will come find you and LOVE your willingness to express your positive opinions"

Throwing your pillow in the dryer for 45-60 min once a month or so helps keep the dust mites dead and a pillow healthy"
Anxiety,fowgu0e,t3_g9yjtn,1588119504.0,"Stick to a daily routine. Make sure you are getting plenty of sleep and rest and exercise. Exercise at a time where you can rest and relax completely for 2 hours afterwards to allow your cortisol levels to drop again.

I will ALWAYS advise for weight lifting training. When we build muscle, we burn more calories on a daily basis so the workout continues long after the gym. 

Use stimulants sparingly. Coffee, nicotine, etc. 

Switch to herbal teas (I love peppermint) to stay well hydrated. Avoid sugar... they are also a stimulant. 

We don‚Äôt always have the option of leaving a high stress job, but learning how to walk away at the end of the shift and enjoy your time off work is vital. 

Learn about ‚Äúactive rest‚Äù these are activities where you are relaxed but active. Hobbies like painting, hiking, walking, swimming, etc that get you moving but also don‚Äôt raise cortisol levels. 


Watch what you eat. You don‚Äôt need to do any crazy strict diets but stay away from junk and eat healthy Whole Foods. Avoid premade packaged foods. Believe it or not, meat and veggies make a full and simple meal that is very satisfying. Marketing tells us we need the rice aroni and other packaged foods... think cavemen diets... 
Best of luck!"

He needs help with his depression. Professional help to be exact. That being said, he also needs to WANT to improve. Hard pill to swallow but... being with you may not be a large enough motivator for him to want to change. 

Depression is tough and we all deal differently. If his depression is inhibiting his daily life and impacting his health (evident by the skin lesions) then he is in serious need of help. 

Unfortunately, your only option, if he doesn‚Äôt want to get better, is to walk away. He has to want to save himself. There is no way around that. 

Your intentions sound pure but he‚Äôs likely going to feel defensive about anything you push on him that doesn‚Äôt make him feel happy. Showering and changing May feel like a huge chore and burden for him. 

Suggest help. Tell him you are concerned. Tell him this isn‚Äôt the future you want for you two. Tell him you understand how hard this is and that his feelings and pain are real and valid but he needs to get help and get better. 

It‚Äôs heartbreaking but depression is a battle people need to want to face and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt happen till they hit a place of such discomfort they finally want to change."
relationship_advice,fow3h4y,t1_fow2r7c,1588112315.0,"Yeah... you might want to bounce that booty right on out there. Spend some time chilling on your own learning to love that body and find someone who‚Äôs got his life straight.

Believe me... I‚Äôm the damn queen of 99th chances. But if my babe ever asked me to move out to give him more alone time... I wouldn‚Äôt look back. 

Putting your boundaries up with someone you love is the hardest thing ever and I swear I have hated myself so many times for doing it with my partner. It‚Äôs fucking HARD. But it‚Äôs paying off. We fight... we stand at odds sometimes but the love is real and we both mold around those boundaries as needed till they are respected or can come down. 

You desire a partner who wants a future... not just booty."
relationship_advice,fow2grf,t1_fow1o4p,1588111788.0,"Oh no! That adds a whole new layer... I wouldn‚Äôt be worrying about the sex life... I would be telling him he needs to find a new job if he wants a future with me.

$250,000 a year... no job is worth giving up my life for and if he‚Äôs legit too stressed to live with his partner then... he‚Äôs losing his life to this. 

I wish you the best of luck and if things don‚Äôt pan out with him (and seriously... give this man no extra excuses... if he can‚Äôt find the gusto to say you are important and changes need to happen... you go find yourself a man who‚Äôs going to make your partnership a priority)"
