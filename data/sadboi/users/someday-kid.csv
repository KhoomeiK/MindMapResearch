guineapigs,fqsn86h,t1_fqq6c62,1589612233.0,"You can avoid chasing them around the cage and your pigs biting you by sorta trapping them. Our pig doesn't like to be picked up. So we cut the bottom off of an amazon box and cut a door to let her in. Once she's in we put a piece of cardboard to cover the door and just pick up the box. It's much less frightening for her, so I hope it works for your pigs!"

KindVoice,fnhyezv,t3_g1qq2h,1586970930.0,"I am also a high school senior [18F] and for my last year, I decided to switch to cyber school. I also have some undiagnosed attention issues that I have to power through. Some tips that my school gave me in the beginning of the year were:

1. Make your own learning/studying area, temporary or not! I found that having one designated area for learning to actually help quite a bit. It adds a bit of normalcy in your day, like having certain classes in the same room. This also helps if you're easily distracted like I am. The less things I have around me that aren't school related, the better I can focus on school.
2. Take frequent breaks. I like to really rush through my work to get it all done for the day so I don't need to worry about it. I find this lowers my performance and attention, especially if I've been working for hours on end. Even taking a nice break for lunch and doing something that makes you happy can help your brain get back into it.
3. If you're getting frustrated or stressed out by a certain assignment, switch to something else for a little. I found that when I'm doing a long and boring assignment, my quality of work tends to go down as I get even more stressed with it. I usually switch to an easier assignment, like something I can finish pretty quickly. If I finish the easier assignment it gives me a bit of motivation and a confidence boost to finish the original assignment.

I wish you very well in your studies during this awful time. good luck! ‚òÜ"

AmItheAsshole,fndztk4,t1_fnd5n73,1586880534.0,"I agree with this. OP let her boyfriend become close to her parents because he has a bad experience with his own. It is understandable that they've become close, as I am in a similar situation with my own family and spouse. But, that doesn't excuse the fact that his demeanor is changing and that he's telling OP's mother about private matters and possibly lying about it. I agree that a conversation should be held between all, if they plan on staying together."

mentalhealth,fmknrm3,t1_fmhnwy1,1586161580.0,"I didn't recognize my perfectionism as a flaw until recently either! I have a few undiagnosed physical and mental issues that take quite the toll on me. It doesn't help either that I didn't have much support during my childhood, which just fueled my low self esteem. My perfectionism doesn't give success, it terrifies me. Seeing a large project scares me because I know that there will be many little details I'll worry over because I need to follow the directions to a T. I can agree with you completely. Perfectionism isn't being perfect."
mentalhealth,fmhb0ks,t3_fv5y5j,1586072944.0,"I was always called mature and well mannered. Little did they or I know it was an instilled anxiety by my parents to do everything perfectly and be perfect. I even got an 'MVP' award in softball when I was 14 because I was 'a good team player'. but aha, I'm just terrified of disappointing others! I'm still undiagnosed of whatever perfectionism I have,, but ooh boy. it isn't fun."

mentalhealth,fafwyo0,t3_e8tjtj,1576033994.0,"In the past year I've been developing dissociative symptoms. It's strange, you're there but your brain is in a different place and you're just... floating. I haven't been experiencing it nearly as long as you have, but it's definitely a really strange feeling. you're not alone! Usually, to help myself focus a bit better, I take note of the simplest things around me. Usually I start off my closing my eyes and taking a deep breath. Then, when I open my eyes, i take note of different colors, textures, and objects i can see around me. This doesn't distract me fully from it, but a nice sort of ""reset"" usually helps me become a little more aware."
