We were a ground floor apartment, so we couldn't leave our windows open while we were out of the house 12 hours a day, so he blamed the mould on our lifestyle.

We got environmental health out who said there had been a previous leak way before we moved in, and this landlord had bought it after that leak took place, yet never got a survey completed.

Me and my boyfriend moved out 3 months before we were meant to, and still had to pay rent. Biggest prick ever."
