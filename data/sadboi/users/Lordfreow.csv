Funko,f4nqxyo,t1_f4nmnev,1571692245.0,"Honestly, my house is WAY to small. I used to keep all kinds of packaging ""just in case"", but since moving to a smaller place, I had to downsize everything.  
  
Those boxes are actually for a baseball and a bat. You can buy them at Michaels. They are the PERFECT size for Pops."
Funko,f4nqid1,t1_f4nil7b,1571692105.0,"I used to collect other toys and figures. I could never stand leaving them in their ""plastic prison"" so all toys are freed so they can be played with like they were made to. Although, from the votes my post has, people must see me as a heretic."
Funko,f4nq4wd,t1_f4l4fm4,1571691993.0,Sharknado was my second ever Pop. I didnt even know people kept the boxes at that point.
bipolar,f4mjf2t,t1_f4mj2an,1571679081.0,thanks. it sucks that you had to go through all that. It is supposed to help with nerve pain. I am hoping to glean some of that.
bipolar,f4mj330,t1_f4mhw4m,1571678965.0,"right. you dont want to be paranoid, but you dont want to get caught off guard."
bipolar,f4minuo,t1_f4m453d,1571678821.0,"I have heard this. The only time I felt anything was probably right when I started taking it, and I just felt pretty chill. I take benzos, and have an opioid prescription, but I use them very responsibly."

bipolar,f4leyng,t1_f4kysdy,1571666196.0,"It seems a weird one. My psych cleared it, but the neuro gave it to me for migraines. I was in a serious funk though, and its in the same family as Depakote which made me gain a ton of weight."
bipolar,f4ksv4k,t1_f4ks6u3,1571657248.0,The depression and suicidal ideation was pretty bad when ramping up on it. Now I am just hungry all the time.

bipolar,f4hj838,t3_dkfb23,1571592192.0,"Very recently, I made plans, I was confident, in general, just killing it. I was getting a bunch of stuff done, and that felt good, so I wanted to get more done, but that required money.  
  
Finally, my wife was like ""Has it occurred to you that you might be in a manic phase?""  
  
no. It hadn't crossed my mind at all. At that moment it was like the sheet was pulled back on a magic trick TA-DA! You are flying, and you are going to crash. Start preparing. My wife is the best for seeing trends in thinking that I miss. Just the way I speak can tip her off to whats happening. Sure enough, the crash came. and it feels AWFUL. Like a car wreck isnt so bad in a parking lot where you are moving slow. but if you are just FLYING, then the crash is so much more damaging.   
  
My wife says she feels like Sisyphus, she keeps rolling that boulder at work and never gets anywhere. I am Icarus. Even though I have been warned, Im still going to fly too high and crash."

The mother clearly felt that Eli could be ""cured"", but she was the one that was trashing his immune system ""to keep him safe"". What did she think was going to happen? He wouldn't be a satan baby anymore? I dont really get it.   
  
I got clues to the end from the front door markings, there are crosses on the top, and upside down crosses on the bottom."
fanedits,f3o4rae,t1_f3kt7sp,1571008373.0,"I like it. I just wish the music were mixed a little higher, and certain sound effects accented like caps shield were louder. Its harder to do without bringing in the soundtrack from the movie too. The song is a good choice though."
fanedits,f3kt1sw,t3_dh5vat,1570969270.0,"I like it, but I think the sound effects are too loud and you cant really hear the music and how it relates to the images. With no many scenes changes, its really noisy."
