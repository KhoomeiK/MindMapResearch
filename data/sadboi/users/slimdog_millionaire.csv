The purpose of a skincare product is to make skin look nicer. If it makes you break out, that’s the product failing to do its job. The purpose of clothing is to clothe you, not to make you skinny. If your clothes don’t fit anymore, the clothing hasn’t failed at its function; it couldn’t expand or contract to fit someone’s fluctuating body because it’s an inanimate object made of a certain amount of fabric.    
    
If someone’s clothes cease to fit, it’s not a failure on the part of the clothes or the person. It’s just something that happens."
