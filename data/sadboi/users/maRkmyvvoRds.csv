An impossible choice between two equally troubling options, so I chose a third. 

Second attempt was similar, but I’d been moved back into my parents house for about two years, and had been having nearly constant flashbacks for a few weeks beforehand.

He doesn’t seem to understand how messy that gets how quickly, and I can’t get him to understand that I’m a different person in our sessions then say when I’m alone and obsessing over some guy I went on two dates with and who isn’t texting me back right away.
