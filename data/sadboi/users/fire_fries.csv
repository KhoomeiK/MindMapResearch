MaliciousCompliance,f395qj3,t3_dfynzu,1570743999.0,So where I am doing school we need to do an internship 3 days a week. So when we got sick we also needed to get a Doctors note at the third day. But the thing is that we were only allowed to uave 15 sick days... If we had more we needed to work the time on schooldays after school or on holidays. Most of my class were 16 and the thing is that it is in the social field so out Internships were in schools or Kindergartens. You can probably think of it but when you first enter a place like a Kindergarten where every Kid want so cuddle and snort on you... you get sick fast and often especially when your body is new to it. We also werent allowed to have overtime and we didnt get payed and that for 24h a week. And I saw hoe my classmates needed to do things that an expirienced person should do.
