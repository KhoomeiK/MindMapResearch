Second idea, they are moving their HQ, what happens to current HQ? Could they not turn it into a HOF? Imagine not only seeing the HOF and museum but you get to be in same building their history and superstars have been."

depression,evjaxky,t3_ck4qk1,1564558857.0,"I went to the hospital because I wanted to commit suicide. I was moved from the hospital to the mental hospital. To be honest it felt a bit dehumanizing at first. Had to be checked out in the nude for lice or contraband, the latter I think because it is where police take people. Had to go through paperwork and rules of ward. Assigned a room but had to be watched as I slept since I have sleep apnea and have to use a breathing machine.

The first full morning was unique, they were all about schedules, meds, check ups and food. The hardest part was being in a place with others with severe issues that made me feel like I was taking a spot from someone worse off than me, but I needed it since I had planned out my suicide.

I was there from Thursday night to Monday afternoon. It had its ups and downs but overall it was good for me. Had a few moments when other patients got violent. Not all units are like one I was on since police bring in people here.

I went in voluntarily and followed the rules, I got away from my day to day and was able to reflect. Not all are the same so you might have a different experience, in my case though it helped and I got some stories out of it as well as perspective that I could be worse off. It made me double down on following my therapy, med schedule and taking care of myself. I don't want to go back and I see it could be worse for me from others I interacted for.

I hope this helps a bit and thinking of you and hope you find some help and relief. It is hard but you are taking the steps to get help."

SquaredCircle,eog3b2d,t1_eoftg3l,1558549886.0,"I personally don't think it should on here the method of suicide. If someone wants to know go to TMZ or some other place that is that heartless. We don't know if she had friends on here and it is sad enough to know that your friend committed suicide but then to see the details on how just seems wrong. I work in media and we only say it was a suicide with no details. We won't even report on someone threatening to commit suicide by jumping off a building or any other way that would sensationalize it or glorify it. 

My personal thought comes from my own suicidal thoughts. Seeing how she did it in a headline was upsetting because this was another human being. I was sad that she committed suicide and to see it almost glorified in a headline was revolting. Again I say people have internet, go find it there and it doesn't need to be posted here."
