depression,fomlph9,t3_g876jr,1587894785.0,"I started thinking of how mistakes aren't a big deal. I went from, ""fuck I'm useless"" to ""no... I know it's not me... I guess"" to ""whatever"" to ""COOL THAT SUCKED MOVING ON"".

This took... YEARS. But now I know how to blow off simple mistakes/negativities and the guilt associated 'em (for the most part). I think what helped me get to that point was telling my brain off for being so dramatic - like I would separate my thoughts into two categories, either it was the depression talking or my actual self. Idk if that helped, but I hope you know that we're here for ya.

Edit: also Reddit's a whole thing anyway, people suck on here when someone makes a mistake. It's unnecessarily ruthless so I don't doubt you felt that way at all. That would get to me too just 'cause it's a hoard of scrutinizing people behind screens. But still, if you can find a way to separate yourself from that, it's really worth it"

I still had family nearby in WA, but there were times when I thought I wouldn't be able to see my dad and grandma for a year. But regardless, I never regret going to university. It's a new chapter in life and it helps you grow no matter what age you are. Independence from family is worrisome but it's also really awesome because of the opportunities that come from it. I say go for it, and make sure you and your parents understand just how hard that will be at times, but that it'll be worth it. Definitely start thinking about how you'll keep in touch with them, whether it's video chatting, phone calls, whatever. Those are my thoughts on it, and ultimately your call. Regardless of what you choose, it'll be what you think is best for you. Stay safe!"

NoStupidQuestions,fmhb82i,t3_fuz2r3,1586073169.0,"Yes, but I want you to consider your wording next time you ask a question about languages other than English. ""Our"" assumes everyone reading this right now speaks English and English alone. Or rather, that everyone reading this only uses the latin alphabet, rather than a Cyrillic or Arabic alphabet for example. Millions of people online are multilingual. Some asian languages have a romanized version of their orthography, so they ""use our"" alphabet. The most accurate thing to say would be, ""How do non-latin languages and alphabets signify question sentences? Are there any languages that don't signify a question in their grammar, and if so, how do they know it's a question?"" Question marks are signified in many languages in many different ways. Sometimes by the question mark, sometimes by a tonal difference, sometimes a diacritic. But yes, question sentences are signified in many different ways.

Empaths,flrqo9v,t3_fqltnu,1585425806.0,"I personally treat dreams only as additions to my thoughts, not solely predictions or intuitions. Sometimes your brain can work out surprising things without even consciously thinking, but on the other hand, sometimes your brain will make stuff up based on feelings. Same with dreams, I would only see them as a microscope to your thoughts, and whether that means something more depends on the situation.

I bring this up because back in middle school I would be obsessed with what my dreams were telling me. It was fucked up to say the least, because it was all about this crush I had. I didn't know him, but my feelings and my subconscious convinced me we were supposed to at the very least be friends. I realized how damaging that was for both me and potential future relationships - to see this completely different person in my head and perceive it as the person I see in reality. It's dangerous honestly. So please don't let yourself be obsessed with dream messages, it'll create a feedback loop of what you ""want to/think you should"" see. But on a positive note, awareness of your dreams can give you good insight to what you're thinking under the surface."
TheMaskedSinger,flhj9b4,t1_flgyff0,1585163711.0,"I agree to some extent, but I wish people knew that there are some very talented internet personalities like Binging With Babish (home cook), Game Grumps (gaming entertainment and music), Jaiden Animations, and Anthony Padilla (thoughtful and informative interviewing, also has acted some small roles) - unfortunately anyone famous on the internet is going to have a very niche group of followers because by nature it won't immediately be obvious to the general public who that person is. The other issue I think is that it's hard for TV execs to know the difference between a good internet personality and a bad one because both - if they've heard of them at all - will have a significant following regardless. Take Ninja for example, he's a bit polarizing because he has controversies but he's a big name in the gaming world and the younger generation for one reason or another. Is he a good person? Bad person? Who knows and who cares, right? I imagine it's the same with Jojo. Actually now that I think about it, _Joji_ would be a pretty good in between. He started as a crazy internet personality and now he's breaking through to the general public as a crazy good singer. Damn I went off, whoops.

I picture a fanatic as someone who knows every detail, who spends their day looking over character bios and scenes to put things together - I just watch the show and enjoy it in the moment. I usually don't dig any deeper than my initial watch. 

I also don't read the manga, I don't cosplay, have any merch, or draw fanart, or read/write fanfiction (though I used to). For example, I watch My Hero Academia but I took a break for 3 months. I caught up, and that's that. I know people who'd be eagerly waiting for the next episode and I'm just not that. I like the show, but if I talked to someone who was super into it they'd talk about things I've forgotten that they think are incredibly important. Consistently I forget character's names, even the ones I really like. I also haven't seen a lot of anime, just a few.

And I think the remaster's great, I played the first Spyro on PS1 so I was worried about how they'd handle it, but they really seemed to keep everything faithful. My only gripe was that the style is very cartoony, but I got used to it after awhile"

asexuality,f71ryog,t3_du2ux1,1573346803.0,"For my parents, I just explained it around the general ""why I think I haven't found the one yet"" conversation. My dad doesn't really get it, but my mom's chill about it. For my friend's, I didn't overtly say it, but I wear ace pins and colors around them. Some of them have asked me about it and some haven't, so I'm personally fine with that.

But overall, you don't have to tell anyone you don't want to. I found it easier to only bring it up if someone has a question or if I'm uncomfortable."
asexuality,f71rmkg,t3_du3mls,1573346594.0,"Ugh, I feel that. The worst for me is when I told a doctor I wasn't sexually active (and never have been) and she seemed to get that at least. Or so I thought. Then she suggested, almost insisted, that I get STI testing. Again, hilarious, but I did it because I was curious about the STI testing process. Couldn't hurt, right? Later on I checked my checkup info on my account and read through her notes. Surprise surprise I'm STI free. Shocking. But I read through in detail and next to sexually active it said ""yes"". It was just... such a lie. And I'm sure to her it was a simple mistake or something she forgot when talking to me, but it's still something I think about."
asexuality,f71qq6g,t1_f70qt3w,1573346042.0,"I also get uncomfortable thinking about sexual intimacy with crushes haha. I personally always thought that if I had a boyfriend, then I would find out how I feel, but being single, I can't ""picture"" myself having sex with another person. So I identify with heteroromantic asexual because I get crushes on men (or masculine identities) where I think they're attractive and cool, and would like to date them, but sex is always forgotten about in my head. Then if I do think about sex with that person, it weirds me out. 

In general, I also am not opposed to sex, but I haven't been in a relationship yet to know how I feel for sure. I'd say that you sound like you're asexual, and if you agree then welcome! And either way, feel free to ask more questions and I'd be happy to answer. Sexuality can be confusing regardless."
asexuality,f71pogx,t3_dti52u,1573345353.0,"Oh wow, I had forgotten about this...

I saw that episode before I found out I was ace. And I remember thinking that the episode seemed weirdly cruel to have been written that way. That despite there being a term for it, asexuality, that a ""tumor"" was making the character ace. It left a sour taste in my mouth, and I felt disappointed afterward but shrugged it off thinking ""I guess that's how it is then"". I was disappointed because I thought they were going to answer something for me that I didn't know at the time - could there be people happily together who don't have sex? And they said, ""no"" and back then I was kind of sad to hear that answer. And... yeah... now I know why I was sad."
AmItheAsshole,f6vcl15,t3_dt65rd,1573182447.0,"As someone studying linguistics, NTA. I regret every single day that I wasn't exposed to at least one other language. Not to mention that this is the perfect time to introduce another language, kids are like sponges at that age. Past 7 is when the brain starts to solidify its language learning and it becomes harder and harder from then on. 

I can understand her concern, or whatever, but she needs to understand that it should not be confusing. Children learn more than one language at any age and come out of it just fine. Kids are pretty amazing! I would suggest that she do research on second language acquisition, and child language learning. Everyone says that the younger, the better. And the amount of usefulness from having bilingual fluency will be invaluable later in life for the child."

marvelmemes,f3bxkig,t3_dgb714,1570817328.0,"I don't really see this as that big of a dig. ""Diminishing to the other movies that aren't getting tickets"", there are some good ones out there and the theater business is dying so I see what she means. But, in Marvel's defense, if the tickets were cheaper then yeah I would see a romcom in theaters, or just more movies in general. $13 for a movie is steep as it is... I'd rather see a superhero throw hands than a cute couple on the big screen. 

And a counter-argument could be that Marvel is filling seats when the theater business is dying, vs the other movies which do ""just okay""."
