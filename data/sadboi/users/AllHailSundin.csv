Some of my depression is circumstantial (losing my mom, not being able to work, money worries and being at home and feeling like a failure in my 30s), but not all. It started before a lot of that. That said, I think it’s one reason why meds don’t help.

I’ve tried 15 or more. Prozac twice. Anafranil, Elavil, Trintellix, Lexapro, Paxil, Zoloft, Cymbalta, Pristiq, Trazodone, Mirtazapine (also for sleep, but it made me sleep a ton and feel very groggy for days), and more.

Also counselling, grief counselling, therapy, a weekly round table support group (suspended because of Covid) and three day programs in 2018/19. Thirty for weeks of daily classes."

Mine really started when my mom was very sick and passed, and I would buy different video game controllers or hockey jerseys that I didn't need or use. Now it's on to books. But I guess I did it some as a kid and teen with movies and games and hockey cards.

I have started doing that, actually. Sitting on purchases that is. I started doing it in the summertime, because I'm cheap and can't work much and don't want to spend too much. It's helped me avoid buying a decent amount of things, but I've broken down and purchased some books despite waiting. Too many really. Most of the books I buy are from the thrift store and cost maybe $2 at most, but I've made some $100-250 orders of Stephen King and other books at Chapters too. Sometimes stuff that the library doesn't have, like the 17 Supernatural tie-ins.

I'm pretty good at coming up with reasons not to buy them, but I'm weak and almost always miserable and buying something helps.

Right now, I have a cart with the six John Cardinal books by Giles Blunt and two by Clive Barker. Cardinal is one of my favourite TV shows and it just ended. It's based on the books, and the libraries near me don't have them. They just have eBooks, and in Canada Kindle doesn't work with Overdrive eBooks. I have a Kindle, and only Kobo works with Overdrive. I'd rather own the actual books than read on my phone or on a Kindle. But it's hard to justify spending another $150 for 8 books."
