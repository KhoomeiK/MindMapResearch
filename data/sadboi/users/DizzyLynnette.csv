Should I try for a 48h fast to break a plateau? I haven't been counting calories yet, but I'm thinking I'm going to start at 1200. Am I on the right track? Missing something? Do daily 16h or 20h fasts? I'm not sure how much is too much or too little... anyway, advice appreciated. I've just never been this big.

3. Thinly slice mushrooms and sautee them in worchestershire sauce, salt and pepper, and minced garlic. Remove them when done and finely chop them.
4. Combine meats, parmesan, mushrooms, egg, and pork rinds to bowl. Add abiut 1T of Worcestershire, 1-2tsp of Italian seasoning, salt and a pepper to taste (estimating- I eyeballed them tbh)
5. Fill onions about halfway with meat mixture, pressing an indent in with your thumb or a utensil. Divide the cheese into four chunks, placing one in each onion. Fill onion completely with remaining meat.
6. Bake for 40 minutes.

**MODMIN POST**

Hi y’all! 

CW/TW weight loss, surgery, dieting, eating disorders, fatphobia, mention of self harm
I
I
I
I
I
The TL;DR: we are not accepting any posts about weight loss, dieting, etc. I strongly urge everyone to read the entire post for a more in-depth explanation.  

We’ve noticed an influx of posts concerning weight, weight loss, diets, etc. and wanted to address it and hopefully help others understand a bit more about fat acceptance and fatphobia. This is a space that supports radical fat acceptance and combats fatphobia, whether it be ingrained or internalized. 

First and foremost: fat is NOT a bad word or a negative. 

What is radical fat acceptance? This is a movement that educates others about HAES, or Health At Every Size. It rejects the terms obese, obesity, and overweight. These are medical terms that are outdated and disproven. More and more studies have proven that being fat does not cause nor lead to hardly any of the previously listed medical conditions that fat was blamed for. The BMI has also been proven as useless and unable to accurately portray a persons health. We have got to break the habit of assuming fat means unhealthy. We ALSO have to stop demanding that everyone be what is considered “healthy”. Chronic illnesses and disabilities exist, and every time those folks see fat people getting berated for “choosing” to be unhealthy, they’re also telling those folks that their permanently “unhealthy” bodies are wrong. While of course people will all have their own experiences, it encourages them to look past pre-conceived notions that have been ingrained in us by diet culture and harmful medical misconceptions. A good way to combat this thought process is this: think of a health condition that we blame on being fat. Now ask yourself, can thin people have this? If so, how is fat the cause of yours? 

The second part of radical fat acceptance is loving and appreciating fat bodies. Some people may think this is the body positive movement, but this came before and is certainly much more inclusive. Even the body posi movement enforces only certain fat bodies as attractive and good. It focuses on hourglass shapes mainly, and tends to have a real problem with racism and transphobia. RFA says ALL fat bodies should be treated as perfect. 

Fatphobia is one of the last standing acts of bigotry that is allowed even in most social justice spaces. It is heavily ingrained in society and fat people are taught to internalize it from birth. It’s so pervasive and strong that it has lead to eating disorders, body dysmorphia, self harm, and dangerous medical procedures.   It’s important to note that all of these things affect fat people as well, especially eating disorders and self harm. We have got to do our part to start dismantling fatphobia and educating ourselves. Fatphobia far extends past insults or slurs; it can be seen in buildings and housing not accessible for fat bodies. Inability to fit in cars, train seats, planes. Refusal by the majority of clothing manufacturers to produce a full range of sizes. Weight limits on most items including medical equipment and office necessities. And the biggest and most dangerous one: medical fatphobia. This quite literally kills people. Fat people are denied procedures, denied specialist care, and go undiagnosed for most dangerous conditions because they are fat. Symptoms will continuously be blamed on fat until we either end up hospitalized with irreversible damage or dead. 

Diet culture and intentional weight loss are extremely dangerous and harmful. Dieting is worse for your body by a long stretch than it ever is just having weight you don’t think you want. Weight loss surgery is not only horrifically mutilating to your body but causes lifelong and irreversible conditions that can shorten your lifespan and cause extreme discomfort in daily lives. 

There is SO much more to this and I have barely tickled the tip of the iceberg here. I know this topic tends to be met with anger and disbelief more often than not; trust me I run a fat acceptance group I see it a lot. But please just try and soak this in and maybe even do some research. Your fat friends and family will appreciate it, and if you’re fat yourself, starting to accept yourself and feel good is going to BLOW your MIND y’all 😂💕

On that note: we will not be approving any posts talking negatively about weight gain, asking for tips on dieting, hating fat bodies, etc. TWs need to be added for any posts venting about fatphobia or medical fatphobia. If you’re struggling with accepting yourself and need advice or the like, please TW the post and the mods will monitor to make sure it stays on topic and nobody is concern trolling. 

Any questions you can ask here or DM me. Most of them will not offend me, I promise. I will warn you now however I am extremely passionate about my fat body and protecting all my fat siblings so anybody getting spicy on this post is going to be firmly asked to knock it off."
