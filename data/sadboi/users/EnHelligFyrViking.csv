As far as the grapple-boost, I’m not too keen on that theory, since they never say anything like that in the games. But, I understand why they added it in Arkham Origins ‘cause it is a convenient form of transportation and gameplay element."
BatmanArkham,fikzi5d,t1_fibfgvw,1582490408.0,"One of the things he had in origins that he shouldn’t was the grapple-booster. In Arkham City, Batman had to do a training program to sort of learn how to use it because it was just a prototype. The only other gadget I can think of that *maybe* shouldn’t be in origins is the electronic gun-thingy he has, but he built it so fast in City that it could be argued he was just so familiar with it from his younger years that he was able to just build off rip like that."
PrequelMemes,fi8d125,t1_fi8bt8d,1582237926.0,"Vader might have had regrets when he first killed Mace Windu, sure. But he wasn’t really full-on Vader then, however, either. 

When Vader went on his killing spree, he had basically disassociated himself from Anakin Skywalker. This is even studied in psychology schools as an example for that specific mental illness. I’m sure he did have regrets, but they were definitely deeply suppressed, almost as a coping mechanism. 

If you’re truly in a regretful state-of-mind, I doubt you’d become so fluid and accurate in executing the activity you’re regretting doing (if that makes sense). He relentlessly tried to kill his master and best friend. He, without mercy, slaughtered the children and former associates he fought in war with and grew up with. He 100% convinced himself that his actions were justified. 

In my opinion, his mindset left little room for regret in that specific timeframe."

He was more so mourning the “death” of his former self and was immensely worried that Padmé would reject Vader as her lover since she fell in love with Anakin. He was crying out of pure selfishness for himself, not for the pain he brought on others. Seems pretty sithy to me."

Depression is not edgy, sexy or mysterious; it’s a disease that can very seriously affect someone’s life and, in the worst cases, end it.

The most bizarre order came from a lady who was upset that the printer chopped off part of a cloud in the picture. I tried to explain to her that that’s how it unfortunately was sent to us, and she got visibly frustrated. She told me she needs the full cloud in the photo. I asked (politely, of course) why the cloud was so important to and she says, “That’s no ordinary cloud; it’s a manifestation of Jesus Christ.” I looked at her, then at the photo. Her, then the photo. I tried my damndest to see JC himself but only saw a cloud. I dared not say that to her, though, and gave my best shocked face I could muster, apologized that there was no way to print the full image, and went on with my day.

My cousin killed himself two years ago, coincidentally on my 21st birthday out of all days, and my family is still mourning his loss. My grandparents have become depressed, saying they can’t believe they failed their grandson. My mother had to fly down to her sister’s house and stay with her for a month to make sure she didn’t do anything stupid during her grief, while at the time crying herself because she also deeply loved him. My other cousin (his sister) went into a momentary drug relapse, and every time we have a family gathering, no matter how wonderful it might be, there will always be that sadness in the back of all our minds knowing we’re missing a member of our family. 

Suicide is selfish. Look, I’m very, very depressed too; I go to intensive therapy every week and had to drop out of college because I could barely get enough motivation to get myself out of bed. But I know my life is not my own; if I killed myself (I’m an only child), I know for a fact my parents would follow suit.

When the shock was over, I looked to my right in bed, and saw a silhouette of a tall man standing over me. I got chills and refused to move in hopes that it would somehow make whatever that was go away. I closed my eyes, but as I did I felt the bed weigh down (like when someone is trying to crawl in without disturbing you), and jolted my eyes back open. He was a little closer to me now, still standing. Then, my alarm clock went off (I had to get up at around 3:30 in the morning), but I ignored the beeping for a while because I was too scared to move. Eventually, the shadow man moved from my bed to my bedroom door. I jumped up, turned off my alarm clock and bolted past him and out of my room straight into the bathroom. I texted my friend and told him what I experienced and got ready. That wasn’t my last encounter with the shadow man, but he hasn’t visited me ever since I first moved out of the house.

As weird as it sounds (and as unbelievable as it seems) those little jests mean there’s still a slither of hope - a tiny spark that says I want to live. 

I would let your best support group know how you’re really feeling, though. I didn’t start really getting the help and motivation to get well until I had a support group. These could be friends, family etc. Even if it seems it’d make them uncomfortable, believe me that in the long run, they’d rather be uncomfortable in that moment, than feel the pain of “what if” from losing someone to suicide. 

YOU ARE WORTH IT, AND YOU DESERVE TO GET BETTER. Don’t let the devil on your shoulder tell you any different. Another thing: medication does actually work. I was skeptical, but after two months of being on Prozac, I’m finally beginning to see a dim light at the end of the tunnel. You can do this!"

People had to leave their rooms and move into other people’s rooms in the meantime. Luckily, my room didn’t get infected, and my room was so small that it was impossible to share it with anyone. So, I got to keep the room to myself."

But, I doubt it; he has always stressed the importance of gun safety my entire childhood, and has never joked or taken weapons lightheartedly. It was entirely out of his character. That’s not to say he didn’t just have a random spur-of-the-moment-who-gives-a-fuck attitude right then and there. But, again, I doubt it."
Paranormal,epjx88j,t3_buukod,1559262286.0,"I can’t say for sure, but I remember my grandmother told me a story of how one day she kept feeling an evil presence in the house, and thought she saw shadow figures on the wall. She then said that my grandfather was acting unusually hostile towards her for petty stuff. He asked my grandma if she knew were his hairbrush was and she said no. He then (as she told it) pulled out a gun and pointed it at her and told her that, if she’s so useless, he may as well shoot her. She ran into her room, closed the door and said she began praying and asking for the negativity to leave the house. When she finished, she stated that a heaviness was lifted from the air and when she got out, my grandfather was no longer upset, just ashamed. 

Just to note: my grandparents have an interesting relationship, in that they constantly throw shade at one another from time to time, but are NEVER in anyway abusive to each other. This was the one and only time he has ever done something so extreme. So, that’s why I think your suggestion is plausible."
WalgreensStores,epjqy3q,t1_ephrwpo,1559258228.0,"Yes! I’ve started to grow an intense burning hatred for anyone who uses Western Union. I know there are a good, reasonable amount of users who understand the rules and how money processing works. But, for the most time, I’m stuck with trashy-ass people who don’t understand the rules and regulations and somehow think I’m the incompetent one. 

One time this lady’s transaction wasn’t going through and I asked her, “Did you misspell your name maybe?” and she looks right at me and in the most disrespectful tone goes “I think I know how to spell my own damn name.” My professionalism died right then and I shouted back, “Okay. I was only trying to help!” I think that startled her that I stood up for myself and afterwards she was acting really nice to me and tried to joke around, but I wasn’t having it. Not my greatest moment, but I was tired of being treated like trash."

I remember when I was young, I actually used a voice recorder and, for shits and giggles, asked if anyone was there. A voice clear as day answers back, “Claudia.” I got chills when I first heard it."

rant,eou6amd,t3_bt2txd,1558857551.0,"I bought an Xbox One X from them thinking something was wrong with my original. Turned out, my original wasn’t broken, so I went in to return the Xbox. They let me return it full price. This was about 3 months ago, I think. I’m very confused as to why they denied your return. 

Also, they tested the console right in front of me to make sure it was still operational and *not* broken. It sounds as if there’s something a little shady going on where you’re at. Or, they literally updated their police on returns not too long ago. Either way, I’m sorry that happened to you. Hope you enjoy the bad-assery that is Arthur Morgan."
