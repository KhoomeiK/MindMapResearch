It's great, then Subnautica is somtehhing to consider, depending on what you like about SOMA etc."
pcmasterrace,fqpgh4c,t1_fqp71rw,1589545784.0,"You are not reading me right. The game is especially good BECAUSE it's an exclusive. BECAUSE Sony holds it to ha HIGHER standard. And put their label on it. Keep in mind i am not trying to fight you here, but without exclusives Sony would not have the hold it has on the console market. One it will keep having this coming gen too, because now they have doubled down and put all of their first party devs under one umbrella. They should be lauded for their keen eye on good devs, and making damn sure the devs get all the money and time they need to produce classics. I see your point, i really do. But for console gamers this would make the decision of buying the right console for them even harder. From your perspective, you want those games for the PC. And i fully get that, but there is a reason there is a saying ""It's PS or nothing"" because microsoft puts ALL of their games out for the xbox on the PC as well. Making it almost insulting compared to what PS has to offer. Without the exclusive deals, the money SONY gives them, and the time needed to make a fully polished product-we would not have classics such as TLOU etc. Point is, it's not a dick move like the epic store, they actually invest in the production of the game from day 1, not simply swooping in and holding them ransom after the fact. Not witholding them them for the sake of it."
pcmasterrace,fqpc21q,t1_fqp71rw,1589542163.0,"It's called business. Sony has paid and worked long and hard to develop these relationships. Exclusives are the lifeblood of the PS4. The Xbox is a useless console, as you might as well just get a decent PC. Sony though? exclusives though the ass. And exclusives also mean extra budget. Think before you speak. If you wan't exclusives pick up the damn console. I will never get people like you. Exclusives on the PS are not the same as a ""epic games"" exclusive. Sony has a direct hand in some way or fashion in all those games. It's something that should be respected rather than taken out."
soma,fqh331t,t3_giucvu,1589366143.0,"No the blackboxes are clearly stated to be overloaded. Also you can see the splatter of brains on some of them, and no detached heads.

That's what happens before they explode."
steelseries,fqgpc0r,t1_fqflvvz,1589352798.0,"Sorry for this short response 1) Yes ONLY for gaming, they are....""decent"" to be charitable for music, and wireless ruins the quality for me, with gamedac on the PS4 tht virtual 7.1 Surround is AMAZING. Currently playing subnautica, re2-3 final fantasy VII remake, hunter: showdown etc. And it sounds just like a real 7.1 setup! so the wireless being good says something, since the wired ones are where it's that! but tbh, some things ar ebetter quality on the wireless (which CAN be used with the gamedac that is used with the wired) completely compatible.) So to be clear the praise i amthrowing on the arctis pros are actually with the gamedac, even the wireless is used connected to the gamedac just like the originals,  rather than the reciever that comes with wireless. Another thing! the earpads to me are terrible, i changed both out for WickedCushions leather memoryfoam ones. The sound is incredible, such great seal and comfort! And a last thing (lol) the equalizer is a little complex compared to say, other popular brands. Since it's all in hz-khz and the presets are TERRIBLE i've found. Not everybody understands what all those sliders do. I certainly did not. I'd dare say that for gaming, at least on the PS4, they are top 3, and for many nr1 still! So that design flaw is pretty damn stupid! And i'll make sure to keep being super gentle with mine for sure!"
soma,fqf3pxt,t1_fqexna4,1589318204.0,OR just an easter egg :P
steelseries,fqf010y,t3_fuevwj,1589316440.0,"A lot of people also treat their headsets like shit whether they think so or not. I do believe there's faults with some of them, but i do not believe this is a issue that is ""guaranteed"" or even likely. (they make hundreds a day, like with any products like these, there will be some bad apples) I live in Norway and i don't have to RDA them, i simply send them for free to the place i bought them at, and they deal with it, sending me a replacement immediately. I just had to return my gamedac tho. Burn in after 3 weeks. How do i avoid this? i only put them in when i am gaming (Ps4 only) because i also have a 5.1 speaker system connected to my tv which makes the headset also recieve sound. I think plugging it in and out is actually counterproductive. I take mine on and off in a relaxed fashion, and i put them down, a lot of people i know drop them. These headsets are some of the best on the market still.  Also for the ""there's no bass"" comments, rumbling bass ruins the sound. It has balanced bass. Honestly too much bass destroys any clarity. As one can see in the comments here, there's a lot of people saying they've had no problems at all. I have mine pretty tight too. Edit: i also have the wireless for PC use (non gaming) and it's the same build as wired. I've had those for a long time. One thing is clear though: that design IS flawed, whether it breaks or not!"

steelseries,fmcehet,t3_e321ne,1585944111.0,"For gaming, if you really want to get all out of it gaming vice, i'd go wired.  I have the latest wired and wireless, i only use the wireless when i'm listening to music out and about. There is a noticable difference, the gamedac is basically an external sound card. So it's not all about the ""high-rez"" sounds which is still in it's infancy. I'll never use that option. Too good surround for that with the pros. However, if you can withstand a smidge less clarity in your gaming sessions, you should go ahead and buy wireless. they are dope as hell. Great soundscape. Currently testing them out on RE3 remake etc, breaking them in. Which btw is not a complete myth, it makes hella sense. fight me commenters xD Edit: and yes they are competely the same driver and software wise, but the wired has cool color options and also WAY more custimization. You don't get to control your equilizer half has much as you can with wired. TL;DR they are both great, but i'd still go wired. The again that's because i have a 7.1 surround speaker system for when i'm walking around the house anyways. Remember to downlaod and install all updates for the recievers and you're good to go.t the steel series app on your PC, from there you can change tons, and then effects aren't limited to just your PC, the headset will remember your new settings without no longer being hooked up to the pc. It's genius TBH. I would NEVER recomend with for xbox players, this is PC and PS4 only."

Nioh,fi4h37e,t1_fi4giua,1582141056.0,"William said after he got his guardian that he was gonna go look for something (i don't remember off the top of my head) so he def had a purpose that a sequel could explore, but people love CAC, and they did the right move in my mind by not following William further.

Nioh,fi4fto2,t1_fi4e98l,1582140330.0,"Because overcoming odds and eventually becoming more powerful and winning is satisfying. Eventually becoming god-tier storywise is a pretty big deal in these kinds of games. Can't escape the DS comparisons. While Ds1 and ds2 didn't utilize this to the fullest, you can basically see DS3 is the direct ""continuation"" from DS1. In DS3 things are even more dire than DS1, the world is literally fallen completely apart in all ways. Making the ashen one much more important than the chosen undead from 1 where the ending in DS1 doesn't even matter in the scheme of things. A prequel goes backwards, i'd just prefer it going forward. But as i said, i believe they didn't know where to go after Niohs ending, and they knew people want CAC and not William. They set Nioh 1 up for a direct sequel, but they didn't have anywhere to go since they set nioh 1 at the end of the Sengoku period. You can't deny all signs point to that if they could do this over with hindsight, this wouldn't be a prequel. I mean the ending of nioh 1 sets up a new goal...They just realized they had nowhere to go. I like my character being the most powerful by the end. Power fantasy, struggle and all that. But i guess they could realistically go anywhere they want from nioh 2. I'm just a stickler, i know that."
Nioh,fi4diih,t1_fi4chz9,1582138992.0,Yes...Especially since Nioh 2 will have a deeper story to it.

Nioh,fi4ddc5,t1_fi4bs77,1582138906.0,"I agree, But unless they reboot after Nioh 2 this will still lead to William. My guess is our character is the one who will set the entire guardian thing in motion,i mean opening the fountainhead to good spirits etc, and he will surely accomplish more in the story of nioh 2 than william in 1. But the fact remains that we can't go anywhere from nioh 2 without william. They'll scrub him either way but i worry for the series as a whole. And i'm just always sceptical of prequels unless it contains the same main protagonist (thank god it's not in this case) but a series like Yakuza is a perfect example for a prequel (0) where i had zero worries. Same character, so all his feats carry over to each game. Feelme? I guess i'm just wondering how they'll make our character be more impactful than William since he put an end to Kelley and also in the ending was going to settle some scores."

borderlands3,f5f4qwc,t1_f5culvm,1572178243.0,"I was tired on ambien. *power through* the game with me.* No I want to only do the main story missions and finish the game so i can have access to the real interesting leveling, the guardian system. Leveling is a joke from BL2 to this. Guardian should have been open since you start your first playthrough. Leveling means almost nothing in this game from BL2. So either i get somebody who is willing to help me blast through everything, or i have to drop the game i just bought. (Didn't think thye were gonna go backwards on the leveling system, but that's my bad) if i had my way i could finish the game and still be as low level as possible for hard mode run, where i would do all side quests and not rush. doesn't help that the level cap is so low with no increase in sight, and that Zane's skills don't work for me. Like literally so not work."

theouterworlds,f59ux8v,t1_f59s6h1,1572095871.0,"Because it usually if not always breaks the games that allow this.  i am purposefully doing so right now with Outer worlds, i am proficient in everything now, i can do whatever i want, speech, hacking, tech. combat. Leadership. And i only just finished doing some quests after i got my ship up and running. I'm that early into the game (what i mean by i can do anything, is that i'm way above all skill checks in all areas, and with anybody i encounter, and i have 26 unspent skill points i am saving for when i reach the next higher skill check. they made the game to be replayed, as they've said.  What point is there when you can do everything? be a specialist in everything? i even get XP for multiple solution access door quests, where i can hack to do something, or lockpick instead of keycard etc. I just do them all for the xp, negating the purpose of sacrificing one skill for another. But i think i gave you the wrong idea, it's just something i've been thinking of since BG days. :)

I am having a blast!

And they could have some encounters where this type of double-crossing is possible, but not all. It's not penalizing, it's ""you have role-played your choice, gotten your xp, and your choice was the choice you made in this situation"" And not let you shoot the NPCs after your choice. They could also just lower the XP you would get for example. I'm not directly advocating for doing this, because i could simply not do it if it were that important to me, and i also recognize that it's part of why we love these types of games. It's still double-dipping, and it's fun. It's great for me, as like i said, i usually don't do replays of games. So i get to see almost everything except choice quests. Anyways, ignore it, it was a minor comment. It is a ""flaw"" because that's not how they would want you to do things, as it grants you limitless power, like i have now. And these games are meant to be replayed with different skills etc to see different things you could not previously, that can't be debated, obsidian has said so about outer worlds themselves. But it's a flaw i personally enjoy."

insomnia,f4b7g9e,t1_f4b1kb2,1571507988.0,"Well actually, Zolpidem increases late phase sleep. So if one discards the addiction, it improves sleep in general. REM sleep in also enhanced, which is why many gett lucid dreams on it. It's a good option in general. research have shown a minimum of 47 days effectiveness- but most people respond to the medication on the same dose at years in the interval. It also has other properties that are not reasonable to put out in this case."
insomnia,f4b6of9,t1_f4as6ew,1571507643.0,"Some people do 50mg, that's shocking as hell. I only see this trend in the US though. And 6mgs of Clonazepam is more shocking if we think medical terms. people are easily fooled by the MGs Clonazepam is actually stronger than Alprazolam. And lasts for about 2 days. steady-state is reached within 2-4 days. *While with Xanax (Alprazolam) can't do that. It has a duration of action (DOA) of 3 hours with a half-life of 6 hours. Clonazepam, on the other hand, has a half-life of 30 to 40 hours. Imagine being wounded and getting a band-aid that's Xanax. but imagine wearing a full suit of armor. That is how powerful Clonazepam (Rivotril) is. It stops panic attacks before they have a chance to even happen. And is also one of the best benzodiazepines if one has to stay on it long term."
