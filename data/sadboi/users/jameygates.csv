https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/what-is/mst/

""Magnetic Secure Transmission, or MST, is an advanced technology that helps power Samsung Pay. It generates a magnetic signal similar to that of a traditional payment card when swiped, providing the added convenience of being able to pay quickly on the go without having to reach for your wallet. It then transmits that magnetic signal from your device to the payment terminal’s card reader for further processing.

Accepted at nearly all payment terminals with a card reader, MST technology is very convenient and is even more secure than traditional methods of payment card. Samsung Pay also supports NFC payments."""

>“But who will perform the legislative function when the State is abolished?” is another frequent question. “You would surely not entrust that to Pinkerton or his fellows!” Most assuredly not. When a person subscribes to a protective association, a clause might well be inserted in the contract by which the subscriber agrees to serve as a juror whenever he is called upon to do so. When a prisoner is to be tried, a juror will then be selected by lot from among all the subscribers of the association. This jury will then judge the facts, and if they unanimously find the prisoner guilty, they will determine what punishment he shall receive.

But who enforces contracts between you and the ""protective association""? Traditionally the enforcing of contracts has been the states role.

Whats stopping me from just saying, ""fuck that contract"" and walking away and joining another protective association that will gladly accept my money?
