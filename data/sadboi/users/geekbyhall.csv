Seriously despite being in the middle of a global pandemic once I got used to everything and got into a routine I got less stressed and anxious in general than I was when I was working. I've even been able to manage my depression. If it weren't for everything going on with this virus I'd have to say I'm happy. 

I'm scared about going back not so much because I'm afraid of the virus (I am very anxious about it and I know I probably will be until I get vaccinated) but because I'm afraid of the stress of my job. It was taking its toll on me for so long and I don't think I realized it until recently."
