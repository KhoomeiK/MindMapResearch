diet,fo65nk0,t3_g5mkmz,1587547421.0,"hi, seems to me you are really struggling with food intake.

so, I have some options for you to discover.

combo 1. Boiled potatoes seasoned with black pepper and salt with soy yogurt..its so filling and tasty and easy to fix.

combo 2. pulses,, so many varieties to choose from, boil the your desired type of pulse and fix a onion tomato gravy separately and mix the boiled pulses with the gravy and boiled oats with it. You say combo of onion tomato makes you bloated , may be you are eating it raw, if you blend them first and then cook it, it should fix the bloating problem i think.

combo 3 boiled sweet potato with almond or any non dairy milk.  

* try skipping meat and other animal originated food for some time and see if it helps."
