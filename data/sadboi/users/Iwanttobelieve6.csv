 Again you don‚Äôt and can‚Äôt know that based  just seeing this video  . And it really depends how  severe ( IF she has schizophrenia) it is , not all people with schizophrenia has all the symptoms stated in the DMS . People with schizophrenia are still individuals with choices . It is ultimately up to them to take care of their mental health . 

‚ÄúThat's why I mentioned my toddler daughter.  She's not held accountable like an adult because she's... not an adult.  She's a very smart girl, but right now she barely even knows how to talk.  She certainly doesn't understand the rules of society.  And I'm not sure that this lady is mentally capable of doing that, either.

We need to stop making excuses for people who are xenophobic and call them out as we see it , whether they have cognitive disability or not .

Ted Bundy was a sociopath who knew there is something wrong with him , and yet he still continue to kill innocent victims and not get help. He was smart enough to know what is right and wrong, even through he lacked empathy.

Hearing that statement really had hurt my feelings and I never call her out for it but I wish I did . It was very hurtful and it made me feel invalidated .  I get that she has her preferences as she should but stIll.

AmItheAsshole,evuc9il,t3_cl6mgt,1564791241.0,"YTA . For enabling your kid‚Äôs manipulative behavior . When you respond every time your kid is behaving badly , he will continue to use this negative behavior to get what he wants . Also , it is DEFINITELY not normal for your older son to be in his room for his safely because his little brother could or already has potentially hurt him. If you do not get him evaluated by psychiatrist or a doctor , he could potentially develop Antisocial personality disorder later on or other potential developmental disorders. I am not , by no means , a psychologist . But I have majored in psychology and studies shown if  children with behavioral problems are not intervened at young age ,  they will have problem with authorities , keeping their jobs ,issues with developing relationship with other people , and may engaged in criminal behaviors .  Chances of him becoming a serial killer is rare but not impossible if he has done the triad : 1) kill or torture animals 2) wets his bed 3) has issues with mother (you).Again , I am not saying he ll become a violent offender or a serial killer , but he could be if he was not intervened . It is YOUR responsibility to make sure your child understand that there are rules and that he needs to respect them .  Ultimately, if he continue to defy your rules  ,he will become a menace to society .

As for leaving your friend‚Äôs at dinner , YTA for that too .  Because you knew your son have behavior problems and apparently it seems like your husband is not taking any responsibility. If someone were to report you to CPS and it becomes serious that you need a trial , the judge will rule you and your husband as incompetent parents because your younger son cause your eldest son to be scared and it seems like you have been neglecting to find out what causing your youngest son‚Äôs disturbing behaviors. Shit like that have to be taken seriously right away ."

It can be really discouraging to hear from a friend that she isn‚Äôt good enough .  Her friend should be encouraging or a least offer to help her , not putting her down . You need to recognize that although she is your daughter and may share some characteristics with you . She is still her own person and deals with things differently .
