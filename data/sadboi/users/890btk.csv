EatingDisorders,fmg2hjk,t1_fmfxej0,1586039868.0,"Thank you dude. I've never met another guy with an ED before, nice to know that I'm not alone.
I relate to feeling like you're not ""allowed"" to have these problems. The idea of a straight adult male having an eating disorder is so alien to most people. It's just embarrassing. It was much easier to talk about my alcoholism and drug problems because they are more accepted ""male"" coping mechanisms. 

Yeah DNP was a mistake, I still want to go back to it sometimes because the weight loss was so crazy fast but I know it's not worth it. I was so dumb with it as well, I just didn't care. I took way too much for too long. 

Yeah I'm exhausted too. So long back and forth restricting, I don't even seem to have the willpower to properly restrict anymore and it's depressing, especially now that I'm a fat fuck. I'm losing weight but it's so slow. I feel like I'll be dead before i ever reach my goal weight."

relationship_advice,fmfe0ej,t1_fmek90h,1586025273.0,"Thank you :) yeah it's difficult. I've had disordered eating all my life and have fluctuated between underweight and obese multiple times. I don't know what ""normal"" eating looks like for me. I have been an alcoholic since i was 21 and had problems with drugs since 17. My mental health is not the best.

Honestly, I don't think she is very attracted to me but i don't blame her. Maybe she's not disgusted but it's hard to imagine that she's not.

I know i probably need some kind of help, I'm going to take it one day at a time. I know drinking is the biggest barrier to weight loss right now so I'm working on that, it's hard because even though i don't drink as much as I used to I'm still physically addicted so I get terrible anxiety when i don't drink. You're right tho, self worth is so important and I don't have much of it. If i hated myself less weight loss would probably be easier."
relationship_advice,fmekaij,t1_fmeiu90,1586006564.0,"I drink alcohol daily which takes up a lot of calories. Definitely need to work on that. It also increases the throwing up problem. 

When i stick to my diet I do well but I struggle with random binges on unhealthy food. I am losing weight, but it's slower than I would like. 

Yeah i do need to exercise more. I used to be fit, i should start lifting again but i struggle with motivation."
