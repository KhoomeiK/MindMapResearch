I'm scared of the hospital, but I don't know what to do. Do you know of other options other than the hospital? The therapists, my school counselor etc. all said that I should just think about other things and try to have a positive mind (which I believe I do have)

In Chinese it'll be the best if you learned the most basic characters and what they mean. Because they'll be in a lot of other characters. Plus learning the pinyin would be great.

If you put these two together it would be 火山 Huǒshān meaning Volcano. Of course this is just a very basic ""introduction"" and it'll get more...difficult later.

Just know the basics and get a strong foundation. Also don't worry so much about writing and reading Chinese when you first start out.
