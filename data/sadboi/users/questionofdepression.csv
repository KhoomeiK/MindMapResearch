relationships,evl3cfs,t1_evk9r7l,1564589854.0,"Is it normal to feel this way after a long time? I broke up with my gf (she wasn't toxic, just a relationship that couldn't work for a number of reasons) about a year and a half ago and still am not over it."
AskReddit,ev0uj43,t1_ev0tcz9,1564146868.0,Hahahahaha! Definitely this.
AskReddit,ev0r386,t3_ci1j5w,1564144884.0,"Stopping. 


I keep myself constantly busy. I have ADHD so my mind is always racing and changing from one subject to another. But I've never ever 'chilled'. My ex used to tell me she wished just once we could swap brains so she could take the strain and let me relax for once. So for me as soon as I try to stop and not do anything. I feel depressed. I feel like I'm wasting my life and no matter what my achievements are they're not good enough. So I keep busy."
ADHD,ev0qnbo,t3_chrq4z,1564144623.0,Literally ALL the time.
AskReddit,ev0lqn4,t1_ev0llcx,1564141571.0,"Thanks, I should give it a go again. I've tried Headspace before but found it so hard to keep to a schedule (yay adhd). Instead my brain is like ""Nah let's rethink your breakup for the 1,000,000th time."""
AskReddit,ev0lk0x,t1_ev0l1ug,1564141449.0,I like this.
depression,euzybb5,t3_chx5vf,1564128645.0,"Yeah I know those feelings also. My happiness has always been dependent on others. I've never once chilled on my own and been content. Friends, family, loved ones, I need someone else to tell me things are ok. I don't have any answers for you, but maybe others will chime in with suggestions."
depression,et9gq38,t1_eqrlhvm,1562596493.0,"Ohhh man I can so relate to this. That point where all the things that used to make you happy no longer do. Everyone has the same advice, ""do something that makes you happy"" and you think to yourself ""I would... if I knew what made me happy?"". 


Good luck, I hope you find something, and I hope I do too :)"
depression,esyryyw,t3_c9irqc,1562348359.0,"All the time. You are not alone. I spent the weekend lying on my couch sweating (air con broken) and doing nothing. I kept thinking I should clean, go to the gym, do all sorts. But what I did was sit there on my phone. I didn’t even pick something to watch on Netflix, hours of scrolling never picking something. You’re not alone."
depression,esxr22z,t3_c9af1y,1562334145.0,"I broke up with my girlfriend because it was long distance and I couldn't handle it, she's met someone else. And now I've realised she was a big part of stopping me from being even worse. It was a year and a half ago and I still think about how bad it is. She knows how bad I feel and we occasionally talk and she's always made it known that she'll be here for me if I need her. But of course she can't be here the way I want her to be. 2019 has so far been awful, just like 2018 and most years before. 


I hope your therapy helps you. I don't have any advice for you, but I just want to wish you good luck."
