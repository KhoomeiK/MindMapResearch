That was pretty awful. My roommate was in some Anti Cop group on Facebook and got into an argument with some cop and they posted the navy seals copy pasta in response and stopped replying. 

A couple official looking dudes were pounding on our door for like 20 straight minutes before one of us realized it was our door (The way the building is set up there's always some kind of banging going on, and we can't hear knocks at the back door from upstairs). 

They said they were with the FBI and thought my roommate was a genuine navy seal threatening this guy. 

We're not convinced it was really the FBI, but probably a couple of this cops buddies they sent over to scare roommate. Especially because one of them, while reading the copy pasta, said something along the lines of, ""and what did you call this? A 'meme'?""

The best way to get rid of someone is honestly to just talk to them every day. They will want to leave eventually. You can't really pick and choose who, you just have to wait until it cycles around. I had a few of the same villagers (that I wanted to keep) say they wanted to leave 1-2 times before someone I actually wanted to leave asked me about it.

Time traveling a week or two at a time is a good way to get someone to move, but is risky considering you will have less control over who it is, and someone you want to keep may end up leaving. Both options have their downsides but both are effective. I normally have one villager asking to leave every 1-3 days and I talk to all my villagers daily (while time traveling forward one day at a time, generally)"
