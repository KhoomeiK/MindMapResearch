But seriously, be very careful to not be sucked into the negativity of many of this website’s communities. Even if you think that a subreddit is just funny and a joke, if it’s dedicated to making fun of a certain group of people, it’s likely negative in a way that can easily suck you in. Do your best to avoid these. 

Stick to the communities that are actually meaningful or productive in some way. Join the subreddits for your hobby to gain inspiration. Join subreddits with people who share your passion. 

But even these positive communities can suck you in. “I want to be productive and make music, I should browse a music subreddit to gain inspiration” can easily turn into hours of unproductive, mindless browsing.

Keep the mindless front page browsing to taking a shit or waiting five minutes for the bus. If you don’t, you will lose thousands of hours of your life over the next few years. This advice applies to all social media."

whowouldwin,fpg26or,t3_gd5xm5,1588591926.0,"According to wikipedia, the fastest recorded punch was by boxer Keith Liddell at 45mph (66fps). Mike Tyson was never measured but I will assume he was up there or close. Let's assume that a fist has to travel two feet during a punch, and round the 66fps to 60fps for simplicity's sake. At 60fps, it would take a fist around .03 seconds, or 30 milliseconds, to cover two feet. 

The fastest human reaction time is believed to be around 200 milliseconds. Even with the .25x perception of time, the average man would hypothetically only have 120 (30x4) milliseconds to even perceive the punch, much less react to it. 

It's also not like the untrained man can actually move any faster due to the time perception perk. While it may make tracking a moving target easier during a punch, Mike Tyson should be able to block the untrained man's attacks just as easily with or without the time perception bonus. 

Just for the sake of the battle, let's either double the distance traveled to four feet or cut the punch velocity in half, bringing the duration of the punch to 60 milliseconds. That still only leaves 240 milliseconds to react to it for the man with the .25x perception of time, which is hardly enough time to even perceive it, much less to make a block while basically moving his arms at quarter speed. 

I'm going to say based off of this that Round 3 is Mike Tyson 10/10. 

As for the other rounds, a boxer who seriously trains for five years might still have a pretty fucking fast punch, and the untrained man's time bonus is cut in half. Even if we cut the punch speed in half AGAIN (to a quarter of the original world record of 66fps), the untrained man will still only have 240ms to react AND MAKE A BLOCK, when accounting for the decreased time slow-down bonus. 

I'm also going to guess that these rounds would go to the boxer 10/10 times if these are five/ten years of serious training."
