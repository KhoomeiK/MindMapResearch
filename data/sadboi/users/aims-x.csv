nhs,fhdzbo4,t3_f2pte2,1581508640.0,"Firstly, the other comments on this post are fantastic and provide some excellent information and recourses for you to try if you haven’t already. 

I’d just add that many DBT resources can be accessed online for free, and you can find out information about this and seek support over at r/BPD too. 

There is also a charity called Rethink who have a useful page on BPD 
https://www.rethink.org/advice-and-information/about-mental-illness/learn-more-about-conditions/personality-disorders/

I’m sorry I can’t offer you more help and I’m really disappointed in the way you have been treated by the NHS. It may be a good idea to see a GP as the other comment said, and fingers crossed they are kinder to you and able to offer help while you are on waiting lists. 

Take care x"
