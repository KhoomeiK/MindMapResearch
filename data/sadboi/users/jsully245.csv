lgbt,fqxjltj,t3_gli6sl,1589733313.0,"I’m not a he/him lesbian, but I’ve dated one before, so I’ll try to explain my understanding. 

First, he/him lesbians and transgender men are not the same thing. A transgender man would likely feel that being a man best represents how they understand their gender. A he/him lesbian would likely feel that being a woman best represents him, but still desire he/him pronouns. As a woman, he can date other woman without considering himself straight.

It’s similar to women wearing men’s clothes, but a bit more grounded in personal identity. A woman in men’s clothes is not a man, they just prefer presenting that part of themself in a masculine-coded way. Just the same, a woman using he/him pronouns is still a woman, but prefers using the masculine-coded pronoun set.

This could be for a number of reasons, though you don’t need to know the person’s reasons to believe that they have them. Some are attached to their identity as a woman and/or as a lesbian and don’t desire to lose it, but would be more comfortable presenting very masculine. Some have a similar gender identity to a trans man or a non-binary person, but understand their gender through the lens of being a lesbian. Some are non-binary, but feel that lesbian is the best description of their sexuality. Some just like the way it sounds. Etc.

Does that answer your question?"

teenagers,fqg56hl,t3_giq0m9,1589338214.0,"I’ve been suicidal for around ten years. Here’s some things that have helped me.

•Parents would be sad. My dad said if I did it, my mom would be “destroyed,” as in barely able to function for a long period of time, if ever

•If you have any dreams or aspirations, you’ll never get to find out if you reach them

•Friends would be sad. In high school, my bf had a friend who committed suicide. It took him three years to be able to think about it without crying, and they weren’t even particularly close. You would be ripping a hole in the lives of more people than you realize

•You wouldn’t get to experience all the good in the world ever again. No more laughing so hard it hurts. No more finding your kind of music and vibing with it for hours. No more perfectly sweet strawberries, or perfectly juicy steaks, or whatever your favorite food is

•If you have a pet, they wouldn’t understand why you just disappeared. If they did get to see you, that might even be worse

•Think of something cool from the past decade. Smartphones, SpaceX, internet culture, whatever excites you. There’s gonna be more new stuff like that in the 2020s, and 2030s, and so on. If you’re not around, you’ll never know what it looks like

A lot of this stuff might feel pointless because you don’t have it now, so why would it matter in the future. Maybe your family or friends are shit, or depression makes it hard to enjoy the little things in life, or you’ve already given up on your dreams. But I’d be surprised if you lived to 80 and most of them didn’t re-enter your life at some point.

When my suicidal urges are worse, I really wanna just give up and have it behind me. But when things get better, it’s almost unthinkable that I felt that way only a week ago. At that point, I wish I could just talk to “suicidal me” and tell them how good it is to be alive. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work like that. When you’re suicidal, the messages just don’t work like they should. So I guess the best I have is that you’re just gonna have to trust me that you’ll start to have good days more often eventually and that you’ll be glad you stuck around. Don’t fuck this up for future you."
