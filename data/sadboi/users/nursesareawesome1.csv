BPD,fn8jiay,t1_fn8jduv,1586743073.0,Im sick of constant mood swings. I feel numb
BPD,fmlcj1g,t3_fvx87k,1586183642.0,"I went through the exact same thing as you..... I stalked this guy and harassed him... I called him like 130 times once when i was drunk and sent close to 1k words worth of texts to him when he just flew for an entire day abroad for studies...... 
I would drunk dial him crying like a loser and even threatened to kill myself (i just wanted his attention)......my friends had to come to my house. I drank for 3 days straight and spent my days in a haze and made my fam and friends worried. My grades suffered badly....   
I was soooo lucky in the sense that the guy i did all those batshit crazy things to is a very, very, VERY patient & understanding person...im not obsessed with him anymore and we still game/talk regularly albeit not abt deep things.   
He was really shocked at first but because of his personality i was able to be friends with him so it depends on what your fp was like... I didnt talk to him for like a week when my friends told him to block me so i can get over him for good.... 
I spiralled. You don't want to walk down the same path i did, i drank & drank & binged on food and puked and i was so depressed i didnt get out of bed for a week straight.   
Grieve now.focus on yourself first. Cry if you have to, exercise, journal, anything to distract yourself from her. Are you able to see a therapist?  
Things will get better, you'll slowly stop obsessing and thinking about that person.   
Remember, our waves of emotions and feelings are valid, we just have to choose the best course of action that would benefit us & not harm the people around us...   
I, too left a wake of destruction and kinda broke a few friends' trust and burned bridges due to my psychopathic shit.   
You live, you learn, you grow, you can't change the past, learn from it, grow, be a better person next time. Now you know what not to do. Please see a therapist or at least a school counselor. You need professional help.   

You will get better i promise. Best of luck!"

HaircareScience,f34k89i,t3_dfmh4u,1570655694.0,"Nope didn't work for me my hair just got oilier and grosser. I wash it every day now. Exact same hair type(mine is short, like chin length) , condition and climate. Just experiment and do whatever works  for you. I don't style my hair or use any dry shampoo but I've had it bleached and colored. Sometimes, I use a protein conditioner called long term relationship by herbal essences on the ends (below ears only) after shampooing with a thickening shampoo by umm herbal essences too I think but any mild thickening shampoo should work. Other times, I simply skip conditioning and use a light hair oil on the ends of my hair. I use vinegar rinse like once a month and every 3-4 months I oil my scalp and hair with coconut oil.   

I don't think you can train your hair to be less oilier especially so that you're a sweaty person living in a hotter climate. Take it from me haha. My hair looks best after it has been freshly washed.

DecidingToBeBetter,ew9fpjm,t3_cncxpv,1565224575.0,"Hey so glad I found your post cause I'm struggling with the same thing haha. I've lost a lot of weight and learned to doll up and because I never got the attention of the opposite sex the entirety of my adolescence, when I do get it now at 20 something I feel my ego being slowly stroked. It feels nice when dudes look at me, I hate it that it makes me feel validated. I absolutely loathe myself for being so obsessed with how I look and how others view me    

Like you, I also needed to get off my high horse and significantly lower my ego in terms of everything and realize that I'm just an average Jane and not some kinda special snowflake. I recently started hanging out with this awesome girl that's really humble and down to earth but really influencer-like. Not a bad thing per se and she has never once made me feel bad about how I look/act but it's my own feelings of inadequacy when people and especially boys ogle at her.   

She's a world of difference from the group I usually hang out with in terms of how they don't really care how others view them and keeping up appearances. She's really humble though and I love the way she carries herself with such confidence brimming out of her.   

Sorry went off on a tangent there but how I deal with being shallow is for example, Like, when Im going out and dolling up and shit, and then once I leave the house I don't think about how i look or whatever anymore. Also, I try to cultivate the mindset that I eat healthy and exercise on a regular basis BECAUSE I want to be healthy and nourish this vessel that's gonna carry me for the rest of my life.   

I avoid going out alone (crippling anxiety) and when I do go out with friends I try my best to focus on whatever we're going instead of fidgeting and gaf about how I look or others view me. The friends I usually hang out with don't like shopping for clothes, makeup and all that and it helps me but I'm not saying to completely forgo your circle of friends or your own interests of these things if you like them in the first place,just try to detach them from your self worth I guess? Like keep telling yourself whether you have these things or not it doesn't make you any less of a person.     


Finally, drill it unto yourself that your value and worth are not tied to your appearance. In fact, anything shallow like grades and material possessions etc do NOT define you. These things can be taken away from you at any point in time and at the end of the day, your core beliefs, your empathy, how you treat others, if you're willing to humble yourself down for others, learning from your mistakes and constantly bettering yourself is what makes you a better person.    

We all make mistakes but as long as you keep getting back up you're doing absolutely great. All the best!"

AsianBeauty,eu48xkp,t1_etv22dz,1563444516.0,"Meeeee. I have anxiety and Ive been picking at my scalp for about 2 years now. Going to therapy for that but yeah damage control involves the normal shampooing and conditioning and then kiku moist lotion on scalp and hair and then aloe Vera gel on hair. I have a dry and sensitive scalp too. It heals my pick wounds and scabs!   

Oh and I'm totally fine with the smell, it smells really faint and nice to me!"
AsianBeauty,eu48bw1,t3_ce2f81,1563443659.0,I can't put it on bare skin with no lotions and potions and cream layered underneath it because I'll get like quite dry. I have dry sensitive skin. But overall I love it. It's cheap and the alcohol means it's easily absorbed into the skin.
SkincareAddiction,eu47nna,t1_eu2r9a3,1563442688.0,I'm really interested in retinoids! I'm 21 and I don't know if it's too early to start using tret 0.05% twice a week and then slowly bump it to daily or how often i can actually tolerate it. Would the cons outweigh the pros? I heard that your skin stops producing 1% of collagen after the age of 21. Retinoids are DIRT cheap here and available otc. Thanks so much for your time.
