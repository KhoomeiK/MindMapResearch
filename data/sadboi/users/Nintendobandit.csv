I broke the hand he was using to hold me with. He did not flinch! He stared at me with angry but cold, dead eyes.

The whole time I screamed like a banshee but people ignored me. Finally, some guy got sick of hearing me (probably 15 minutes i screamed) and came and threatened the big guy. THAT made him let me go.

Cops were called; they told me his hand turned wild colors and got verrrry swollen. IE: I had broken the shit out of his hand. Luckily, I was physically unharmed. Mentally? Not so much.

Due to experiences prior with the injustice system I declined to press charges. I wasn't going to subject myself to another trial when the criminal would receive either no punishment or too-light sentencing.

For decades after I always checked my six. Still do, sometimes. Also, I refused to wear long, loose-fitting sleeves for at least 15 years, if not more.
