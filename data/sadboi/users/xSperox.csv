mentalhealth,flcevu8,t3_fnum2j,1585028333.0,"Thinking ""I would rather die than be here"" is a thought on its own, it's a negative one and one that should not be taken lightly in any way. However, the genuine thought ""I want to kill myself"" is very different. That is you admitting to yourself that you are in fact, to some extent, suicidal. 

A suicidal thought is simply that. It is the thought of the before, during and/or aftermath of your own suicide, as well as, in some cases, the actual planning of said suicide. 

If you are in any way thinking of hurting yourself then please, please seek help. Being unable to seek therapy and/or get a disgnosis is one thing as I know there are many reasons people aren't able to do so. But hurting yourself and having suicidal thoughts are much more urgent and extreme concerns. 

There are suicide hotlines you can call, I understand that if family is an issue then you can do this without telling them although I urge that you speak to someone at least who you are close to. 

Please stay safe, especially at times this these and I hope this helped."
mentalhealth,flcdypm,t3_fnk22w,1585027442.0,"Something I've learned throughout my life is that emotion, feelings, they're gonna be here, that's just how it is. We NEED emotions in order to be human beings, good and bad. Don't ever feel like you aren't allowed to feel lonely or sad or angry just because someone else told you so.

You are valid, your feelings are valid and with that, tour loneliness is valid. 

I'm really sorry that you feel lonely and are going through a difficult time and mine along with a lot of others DM's will be open for you to chat if need be. Just don't ever feel like you're not allowed to feel something because other people have an opinion on what you should feel, they don't get a say in it."

I read through lists on this thread of difficulties that either sex has to deal with and a lot of these difficulties are things that wouldn't exist if we were all just a little bit nicer to each other. 

Sexism exists when it doesn't need to. Racism exists when it doesn't need to. Homophobia exists when it doesn't need to. The list can go on and on. 

There is no need for it, what is wrong with the human race?

There's also the issues with Brexit right now, Britain leaving the EU, largely to ""keep out the foreigners"". It's sad to see the amount of racism and xenophobia in this world that I had been blind to for so long.

Don't get me wrong, racism works in all directions, it's just perceived differently depending on which side of the ""pigment spectrum"" you're on."

I've spent my life being kind to people, putting others first, I took the ""kindness"" aspect too far and became fake.

However, even with years of repressed memories there are still a few that make me believe it wasn't all bad. 

One of my fondest memories and is about my online friend as a kid. My childhood left me very depressed and anxious so I found an escape to life through video games and was so excited when I met a fellow female on black ops (this was around the time when girls gaming wasn't seen as 'cool' so there were very few to find). We hit it off instantly and I remember our first Christmas as best friends, she lives 6 hours behind me so I was up all night talking to her, excited about it. She sent me a video of her presents all piled up and I remember being able to open mine hours before her and sending pictures of what I got to make her jealous :) 

We also used to send each other really inspiring and empowering messages (at the age of around 12-14) and I made a video using all of them for her 14th birthday (I think I still have it). She honeslty the only reason I got through my childhood. 

We grew apart over time and especially due to the extreme distance between us but she is one the piece of my childhood that I could never forget about."
