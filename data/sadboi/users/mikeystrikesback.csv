But I hadn’t known it would turn into mania bc I hadn’t been diagnosed yet, so I was rather reckless for the few days before it got really bad. 

Looking back at past episodes, alcohol always had the effect of helping me for a bit and then making me a lot worse when I’d sober up

My best advice is to avoid alcohol at all costs as well as any drug with a psychoactive effect, plus get a healthy and routine amount of sleep."

BPD,ez8hl3s,t3_d04dc4,1567743664.0,"My experience was similar: bouncing from diagnosis to diagnosis before discovering BPD outside of therapy. I read all about it and related to basically everything. Eventually I brought it to a. We therapist and psychiatrist.

What they both told me was they weren’t comfortable giving a diagnosis upon early meetings. After a few sessions we went through the criteria together to see if it felt like me, and that’s when I was formally diagnosed.

I think the weird thing about bpd is how it can manifest as so many other things if your clinician doesn’t have the big, lifelong picture. Bringing it up first can at least put it on their radar and help them understand you more, even if it involves ruling that diagnosis out. 

TL;DR Don’t wait to let them figure it out, provide them with your own information and inferences to help them make a more informed decision and treatment plan. In any case, I hope this helps!! It’s tough out there :/"

However, I’ve basically had the entire summer off and away from stressors, so that was also a likely factor in my mood. School starts up again soon so we’ll see how meds stabilize me, but I’m optimistic. 

Meds are different for everyone, though. Only way to know for sure is to try (to the extent that it’s safe to do so)"
