edit: id recommend mixing it with a large flat popsicle stick/ similar flat stirer & scraper in a disposable cup. the cups can be reused depending on their texture - the layer of unscraped silicone peels off really easy when pulled off a nonstick surface. also score the surface of whatever youre about to whip and wipe it with an alcohol prep pad or an equivalent. 
hope this helps! ♥
edit 2 bc i forgot to mention it: clear silicone makes a tiny bit of paint go a long way."

i think the fact his style hasn't changed despite the lack of success that '10 things about' videos have been bringing as of the last like 10 years could tie into the 'youtuber' title thing or could just be a result of his narcissism.
