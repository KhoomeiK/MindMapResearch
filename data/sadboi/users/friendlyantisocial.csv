Ground beef, pasta and canned spaghetti sauce- cheap and filling

Grilled cheese and canned tomato soup 

All of these meals should cost around 5 dollars or so for 4 people. One thing I learned being a single mother- the dollar store doesn’t actually save you money.

There was chronic negligence in cleanliness, basic needs etc and food scarcity because that woman kept the pantry, fridge and freezer locked. Because of that, I wandered a unsupervised a lot. These two caregivers were rarely if ever available if something happened and it often did. I was raped at 4, severely tortured at 6 and at 15 I was handed to that woman’s boss because ‘at least then she wouldn’t have to worry about me’ even though he was 36 and a pedophile. In spite of those incidents, my elder sisters had it far worse. All three have criminal records now, and involved in either prostitution or drugs, or both. Even though I have no record and have lived as a law abiding citizen, somehow I’m the one blamed for everything, so I don’t keep in contact with any of them or my brothers. 

I know what a relatively good childhood looks like,  I’m now providing one to the best of my ability for my own family- but I never had a chance to experience it myself. I have a diagnosis of ptsd and bipolar depression(meaning my most common or strongest emotions are irritability and/or depression), I suffer from chronic muscle pain and migraines as well as an over active adrenal gland that is impacting my heart though they don’t have a diagnosis for what that will mean long term. 

I don’t know how to socialize on a basic level although I’m pretty nice and don’t gossip or participate in mind games(which I despise) but I don’t know how to connect or trust very well. But I also have a deep sense of empathy and a very heightened sense of right and wrong and I volunteer in my community often. One thing that continues to effect me most however is that I know I will never be able to really bond and connect with others or be normal, but I can’t share the extent of what happened to us to explain why I’m so reclusive- because people find it easier not to believe these things can and do happen in America, and I don’t want to deal with being called a liar anymore or treated like I’m crazy.
