StopSelfHarm,fqq94jr,t3_gkckio,1589561505.0,I would consider entering group therapy if you have a desire to help others. Group provides a great opportunity for this.
MusicBattlestations,fpak2ge,t1_fpahk48,1588449792.0,"In that case, probably not to be honest. But if you ever start deciding to record anything I would get one for sure."
MusicBattlestations,fpah48g,t1_fpadkt3,1588448053.0,Absolutely. It allows you to connect any electric instrument or mic to your DAW easily. You can also use headphones or monitors through it and can make sure that you are clipping.  Focusrite 2i2 is a great place to start. I have wasted a ton of money on gear and feel that the 2i2 is one of the best buys I have ever made.
MusicBattlestations,fpaarr0,t3_gc90wc,1588444293.0,Welcome to the best hobby in the world. I would invest in a decent audio interface early. It took me WAY TOO LONG.
therapy,fp6hjoc,t3_gbarai,1588352450.0,"Psychologist here. This can be caused by a very large number of things. As has been said, I would share these experiences with your therapist and ask for their impressions."
therapy,forhzku,t3_g931lj,1588012557.0,"Psychologist here. No, it doesn't look bad. To me, clients taking notes communicates that they are engaged in treatment. Just make sure you say that you are looking at notes so your actions aren't misinterpreted."
starcraft,foauqgz,t1_fo9m8up,1587652804.0,Yes! Thank you!
therapy,fk8qivh,t3_fgyp61,1583960987.0,"Psychologist here. If I am ever more than 1-2 minutes late, I apologize. I have only be more than 5 minutes late once, and that was because I was hospitalizing a client due to suicide risk. I ended up rescheduling that session for the next day to ensure that we had sufficient time to do the work that we needed to. 

There are circumstances that make us late sometimes, sure, but not recognizing the impact that this can have on a client is a mistake on the part of the therapist."
Type1Diabetes,fg4hcv5,t3_ewq38d,1580503331.0,"Low = anxiety, sweating, racing heart, shaking, dizziness 

High = irritability, thirsty/dehydrated, nausea, feeling dry/like all the water in my body has somehow been removed"
AskReddit,ffu5w1d,t3_ev5zdg,1580235154.0,4 days ago when my wife and I learned that her cousin was no longer willing to be a surrogate for us.
TalkTherapy,fbbgfce,t1_fbb4iha,1576699926.0,I completely agree with you. I guess it is hard to answer the question of what makes me think clients are smarter than me other than simply feeling like they are smarter than me haha
TalkTherapy,fbb09ba,t1_fbamlrg,1576690578.0,"I’ve worked with medical doctors, professors, researchers, other psychologists, and all sorts of people who have degrees that I could never obtain and skill levels that I could never reach.

One thing worth noting is that no matter how smart someone is, they cannot view themselves as clearly as I can as an outsider with training in psychotherapy. The only thing the eye cannot see is itself. 

I consider myself to be a pretty skilled therapist, yet my times in therapy have offered me things that I couldn’t see in myself, regardless of how good I might be at my job."
TalkTherapy,fbaheeu,t3_ecc7ua,1576678227.0,Psychologist here. I absolutely have had multiple clients who were considerably smarter than me and I feel we were able to do good work together.

GuitarAmps,f83r0ts,t3_dyuq6n,1574218657.0,I am sure that puts out a nice tone. However you should clip those strings before they stab you in the eye.

diabetes_t1,f1jg9mz,t3_d99v57,1569522855.0,The being sidelined because of a low is always the hardest part for me. It just makes me feel so useless/weak.
guitarpedals,ey61icm,t3_cvpmde,1566845263.0,Happy to see you know how to properly adjust the HM-2 :)
Psychiatry,ewrkn20,t3_cpsyrs,1565707708.0,"Psychologist here. DBT skills are excellent and are all available for free online. I would still recommend you buy the workbook though. TIP and DEAR MAN are arguably the most usable of the skills and I use them regularly, even though my work is largely dynamic."
diabetes_t1,es431gy,t3_c5q15r,1561576030.0,Diagnosed at 29. It has probably been the hardest thing I have ever had to adept to. This sub helps.

screaming,er5wk1t,t1_er5t06b,1560534965.0,Makes sense. To be honest I’m a beginner too so I’m not sure. I know he does some inhales but that is about all I know. He was epic when I saw them live several years ago.
screaming,er5ggcj,t3_c0iaj6,1560525530.0,"Since you are just beginning, I’d recommend trying to find your own voice first before attempting to imitate someone else."
