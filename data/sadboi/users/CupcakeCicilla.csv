Anxiety,fqdejps,t3_g8v0l8,1589287893.0,"I've loved working from home so far and seriously dread going back into the office. Enough that I imagine I'll need a half day when we go back because I'll be going from being around a cat, dog, and in the evenings my fiance; to seeing 200+ people, dealing with claustrophobia inducing turnstyles to get into my office, and having every person distract me as they walk around because my brain is stupidly hyperaware of everything and I need to be doing 3 things at once to negate it all.

My coworkers have been talking how they want to get back to the office and see ppl not in their families again and I'm just in the background thinking ""I'm good never seeing you guys face to face again."" Not in a bad way though, I like my coworkers. 

Staying home? I need to work out a cleaning schedule and at work slow down because the system can't keep up with me (which is an in-office problem too xD)

But I'm lucky enough our boss is already looking into a rotating work from home schedule. Usually whatever she hints at happening actually happens, so I'm excited for that to be a thing, even if I have to get back on the phones from home.

5-11 I lived near a graveyard, house wasn't too bad, but the woods (schoolyard sized, no animals of note) I had stopped playing anywhere near because I had seen a super tall, dark something stand and look toward me. I booked it right back out of there.

12 I lived in an old farmhouse. This place might've been the bad wiring giving us hallucinations, but we never liked looking out the windows (in an attic room that you would have to make a lot of noise to get to, I saw someone in white. I tried very hard to ignore that I saw that.)

16 we moved into a duplex that was scary as fuck. Mind you, there were 2 petite women (me and mom) on our side, and a frail old man on the other. 
Hearing heavy, stomping steps sounding angrily towards your room late at night is absolute nightmare fuel. Mom and I heard this on separate nights (she searched the house with a gun, nothing.) 
Mom saw small shadows that were definitely not our animals, me, or anything outside since the windows weren't large enough (or angled right) to reflect outside.

Fill the skillet with approx. 2 cups of water (never actually measured this. You'll want to be just over the noodles so it cooks down fast enough)
