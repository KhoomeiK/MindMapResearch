Either her hormones are extremely off balance or her brain is off balance. I am speaking from personal experience, as well. What happens if you stand firm with her? Refuse to let her pack the kids' things? You may not like this, but you may have to call a psych ward to have her involuntarily committed if she continues to act this way. She will eventually become a danger to herself and/or the children. She needs more than just a couple weeks of therapy. Maybe start setting an alarm for her meds and see if that helps her?"

You need to take her to a different doctor. Have you asked her why she stops taking her Zoloft? Could the side effects be too much for her? When I was on Zoloft, it made me feel out of touch with reality and made me into a zombie. Be open with her and communicative. Have you tried calling and talking to her ob/gyn or her primary doctor over the phone? Often they can point you to a specialist for her and possible a post partum therapist."

I won't be having any more, but it is possible to still have children despite the diagnosis. Please get her into a therapist so she has a safe place to work through all her fears and anxieties.

She would always hit me and use me as her emotional and verbal punching bag, but she kept my sister basically locked in her room for her entire childhood with nothing to eat except dry cheerios and peanut butter sandwiches and nothing to drink except 3 glasses of bathtub water every morning.

AskParents,fondugm,t3_g8dy0n,1587917586.0,"I know I disappointed my parents as well. I was homeschooled since 2nd grade, my mom always pushed me to work harder. She took me to our local community college at 12 years old to take the assessment so I could take advanced math courses and Spanish classes that she couldn't teach me. I passed the assessment with no issues. After I turned 18, we got into a huge fight and she kicked me out in the pouring rain. Eventually, I ended up catching a felony and spent time in prison. I am now about to be 31, have 3 beautiful boys, a boyfriend that loves and supports me, and a career at Costco. We plan on buying our first home in a couple years and I no longer speak with my mom. It took me years to understand how toxic and abusive she was. My dad, on the other hand, is proud of who I have become today. No, I don't have a college degree, but I am not afraid to get dirty or bust my butt at any job I have ever had. And I am more than happy to pull my fair share of bills and home responsibilities. My boys are always fed, clothed, and extremely happy (if not a little spoiled from time to time). Point being, a college degree isn't always what it's cracked up to be.

As for the dead bedroom, I pointed out several things--including the fact that our sex life was great before I got pregnant and that around the time we were trying (it took us 4 months to conceive), he started joining Reddit, mewe, and his porn usage increased tenfold. During the pregnancy, he would come up with excuses to not have sex and I constantly found porn on his phone--everything from nude celebs to stories (erotica) and even nsfw Reddit posts where he would comment and call the women ""hot"", ""sexy"", etc. I called him out on it and flat out asked him if he has a porn addiction. It took him a few minutes, but he admitted he thought he did. Plus, he is having performance issues and he doesn't know why. Open communication, brutal honesty, and neutrality (no judgment for anything being said and promising never to use it as a weapon against the other person) is what is helping our dead bedroom. We are now taking steps to help him with his addiction and setting up doctor appointments to see if his performance issues are physical or mental."

Other than that hiccup, our relationship is great. I suggest getting your divorce in order, hiring a lawyer if possible, and continuing those lovely dates. If you are the breadwinner, most likely you will get hit with having to pay alimony.

depression,fgv51en,t3_f0fyui,1581137339.0,"Not single here (February 19th is our 2 year anniversary) and I feel the same way. I hate this day, to be honest. When I was single, I hated it because I felt lonely. Now that I'm in a relationship, I hate it because I still feel lonely and it's a day that you HAVE to show affection and buy garbage to ""prove"" your love to someone. I would rather this day just be another stupid day..."
childfree,fguqiy7,t3_f0geao,1581127108.0,"That is just nasty! In a grocery store, where people buy food, no less!!! I would be embarrassed as hell if that happened to me. However, if I knew I had a bladder incontinence problem, you wouldn't catch me without a diaper!"

breastfeedingsupport,fgrmu2i,t3_f05ci7,1581051004.0,"My baby will be 3 weeks on Saturday and I am literally struggling with the same issues. I strongly suggest seeing a lactation consultant if you can. I ask mine constantly for lists of foods that can help with breast milk production. And I took to fb in my mom groups for help. Lactation cookies seem to help me (I got mine at target. Going to Wal-Mart tomorrow to get some more). They taste a little bland, but I have heard great things about them. Stay away from fenugreek. I have been told it's a 50/50 chance of either helping you or stopping your milk all together. Keep taking your prenatal vitamins! The iron in them can especially help with production. Oatmeal is your best friend right now. It helps with breast milk AND helps with constipation (which can be caused by said prenatals). Also, Google ""power pumping"". Basically it's pump for 20 minutes, pump 10 minutes an hour later, pump 20 minutes in another hour, and so on. If you can't get it in every hour, at least pump every 2 hours. Set an alarm if you have to (I know I do!!!). And MAKE SURE YOU EAT!!! I don't know about you, but I have a HUGE body image issue, so I really don't want to eat constantly. But I have found eating 2-3 meals a day along with 1-2 snacks a day has really helped my milk come in stronger. Usually, one pack of lactation cookies is a ""snack"" to me. I have found that massaging my breasts while I pump helps let more milk down. Good luck and please, don't feel bad if you can't nurse or pump for as long as you like. My milk has always dried up at 2-3 months post partum, no matter what I do--and this is my 3rd baby. I'm hoping this time is different, but I keep reminding myself that as long as baby is fed, full, and happy, that's all that really matters. 💖💖💖"
childfree,fgrfvl8,t3_eznuqa,1581045803.0,"What in the actual fuck?! I threw my own baby shower with things from the dollar store and we bought all the big ticket items USED. Why the fuck does someone expect anyone to fork out hundreds of dollars for something a baby won't use for very long anyways?! Seriously. Hormones or not, she is acting like a spoiled, entitled bitch. My guests brought over bags of nice hand me down clothes and blankets and we were overjoyed that we got anything at all! In fact, I was pissed off that my sister in law spent almost $200 on a playpen! I told my boyfriend that was way too much money! That's just how his family is, but still! Smh. I would have offered to exchange the car seat and kept the money. She doesn't deserve it."

My baby will be 3 weeks on Saturday and I am already having to supplement with formula because my body just doesn't produce enough milk for him. That fact that you have gone 5 whole months with breastfeeding is amazing!!!"
relationship_advice,fgo7h6s,t3_ezivwn,1580961672.0,"No happy ending? I beg to differ! You have your sister, you got rid of a potential problem, and you both are much happier. In time, you will find someone who will share your values on family."
childfree,fgkupx6,t1_fgkrlqx,1580874038.0,"I'm a parent. I found this group by accident and I have C.F. family members. This sub opened my eyes to a whole new world I had no idea existed. I do agree with a lot of issues C.F. people have to talk about--being allowed to get a vasectomy or hysterectomy whenever they want, at whatever age they want, and without permission from anyone; having access to planned parenthood without being discriminated against; and the rude, snotty, entitled kids with the equally rude, snotty, entitled parents. I am also proud to say that I learned what a bingo is and actually helped defend my sister against one of her (now ex) friends who was trying to bingo her. I honestly love this sub and fully support c.f. people because it's honestly no one else's fucking business when or if you want kids!"
childfree,fgktx11,t1_fgkr5oj,1580873517.0,"Agreed!!! I think my middle son has ADHD, and he is treated the same way as his siblings. You misbehave, you face the consequences.

beyondthebump,fgfg994,t1_fgevoim,1580737865.0,"Honestly, I don't think the age gap matters for my boys, but every child is different, too. My 4 year old is a bit of a squirrel, so I'm glad we waited til he was a little older. My 6 year old was a great help and a terrific big brother at only 2. Both of them love to help with the baby now. They enjoy reading to him and singing to him all the time. I do prefer to keep kids closer in age range simply for the fact that I don't feel like I'm starting all over again. My 4 year old will be starting kindergarten later this year, so it will be just the baby at home, which means I still need a babysitter."
beyondthebump,fge3lfj,t3_exx71f,1580690575.0,"I wish I could upvote this a million times over. I've been feeling down a lot lately. I have 3 boys, 6, 4, and 2 weeks. I'm struggling with the breastfeeding, struggling with getting my oldest to school, struggling to keep my spirits up, and struggling to be a normal human being. It isn't easy and I struggle with postpartum depression, too. Keep your head up, mama. We are all in this together. 💖💖💖"
AskParents,fge1l1t,t1_fgcds06,1580689457.0,"Therapists, counselors, etc. It's because they say it takes that long for someone to show their true colors and true intentions. So, rather than having a relationship clouded by great sex and crappy standards, you have a stable relationship all the way around. No offense to anyone, by the way. It's just what multiple counselors and therapists have told me."
AskParents,fgbp9lc,t3_exjunj,1580664710.0,"I'm a mom myself. My oldest is only 6, but I was homeschooled and pretty much stuck at home 24/7. I lost my virginity at 18 by sneaking out of my bedroom window and meeting a guy around the corner from my parents' house. (My mom was extremely controlling). Even as adults, it is recommended to wait at least 6 months to a year before sleeping with someone. I know society is all about one night stands and sleeping around on the first date, but if you are truly wanting a relationship to last, it is best to wait. That being said, I strongly encourage you NOT to have sex in public places because they are nasty, for one. People urinate, deficate, vomit, bleed, and spit in public places. Not to mentions animals as well. For two, if the police catch you, you both can be arrested and put on a sex offender registry. That will badly affect both of you in your futures, because that will limit where you can live, where you can go, and definitely limit your job opportunities. I would imagine your mom is possibly in denial. Does she know you have lost your virginity already? She may not be ready to face the fact that her little girl is growing up. She may have had a pregnancy scare while she was a teenager and doesn't want you to go through the same thing. Try sitting down with just you and her and ask her. Communication is key here. Present your feelings and reasonings without being argumentative and then listen to her side. She may have reasons that none of us have thought of and she may be able to give you some wisdom and insight. Good luck, sweetheart! And I do want to give you praise for using protection. That is very smart. Ask your mom if it is possible to get on birth control as well, considering condoms do sometimes break."
childfree,fg6ndc4,t3_ex1hho,1580572428.0,"Mom here. That is just disgusting. No one wants to see your child's private parts, for one. Public areas are nasty as hell--especially bathrooms. And a dinner table?! Where people eat?! Changing pad or not, that's just gross. I would get up and walk away from my food if I ever saw that. Take your kid to another room or somewhere private to change their diapers."
JUSTNOMIL,ffno9o9,t3_eu80dw,1580068475.0,"If your court house has a self help clinic (which most courthouses do), I suggest going in there with all your evidence and ask about a restraining order. From the sound of it, you have enough evidence to file for one, despite her being in another state. And also, try changing your phone numbers if possible."
relationship_advice,ff9mn8z,t3_es8jy7,1579716186.0,Be supportive of her. I was gangraped and ended up pregnant from it when i was 19. I had a miscarriage and i never had anyone to talk to about it at the time. I eventually got therapy for it and I have now accepted that part of my life and moved on. My boyfriend of 2 years knows about that part of my life and he supports me inside the bedroom and out. Just be open about boundaries and what she is comfortable with and what is a hard no. The fact that she trusts you enough to tell you about something so traumatizing says a lot about how she feels about you. Tell her how you feel and how you want to make sure she is always comfortable during sex. Communication is key here. Keep it open. And just love her.
childfree,ff9lue4,t3_es98jm,1579715712.0,I'm a mom and I cannot commend people who are dedicated to the childfree lifestyle enough. Seriously. You have to field off bingos a lot. You have to be dedicated to preventive measures.  You get judged a lot (my personal opinion). It can be difficult to date. It isn't easy! Another reason why I enjoy supporting you guys wholeheartedly. Treat yourselves at least once in awhile! It's a wonderful accomplishment in my books!!!

relationship_advice,feeckkg,t3_eoihfs,1579030968.0,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years next month. Normally, he lasts awhile and we have a great time. Once in awhile, (especially if it's been more than a couple weeks of sex) he turns into a minuteman. It happens sometimes. Men get extremely self conscious about it. It affects their ego. Just be patient with him and definitely give him a second chance."

AskParents,fdsexzm,t3_emthg0,1578701172.0,"I do this, too. I was traumatized badly as a young child (3-4 years old) and my adopted parents never put me in therapy, despite being told I would need it. My adopted mother was verbally, mentally, emotionally, financially, and physically abusive. I was also her verbal punching bag. I'm not nearly as bad with my boys (6 and 4), but I still catch myself flying off the handle at them from time to time. My boys try to apologize to me for whatever they did wrong and I try to be a bigger person and apologize back to them and explain to them what I did wrong and why. It's a big step for me and I do try to walk away when I feel myself getting angry."
childfree,fdqzq14,t3_emorjx,1578677523.0,"Wtf?! So, who is the parent in that household?!?! Childfree or not, you definitely dodge a bullet in that household.
