confessions,fnfi9sa,t3_g1g3io,1586908568.0,"I've been staring at the screen debating posting this comment on this account or not because I've shared my face on here, but in the end I think I need to learn to not be ashamed of past abuse.

  
Hi, I'm 19 and I was groomed online by an older man from when I was 14 onwards to be a pet/slave in a polyamorous relationship setup. Because of the grooming my aspirations and desires were very similar and my mind is very damaged from it. By 16 it went from online to physical. For about a year afterwards I struggled with wanting these kinks while also being disgusted by them. Today I'm simply disgusted.

I can understand not wanting to have those sexual desires ever again. But you can heal and desires can either change over time or your mindset can change and they can become *healthy* desires.  Try not to let it control your life.

You mention you've only ever opened up to one person about this before, so feel free to message me if you ever want to talk about it, not to mention there's plenty of online communities that can help too."
