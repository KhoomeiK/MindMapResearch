depression,epyekfd,t3_brffm6,1559630514.0,"I have told all of my closest friends that I've wanted to kill myself repeatedly and even went into detail about my plans, like which building I would jump off of or how I want to wait for my parents to go to sleep, steal my dad's keys and die via carbon monoxide poisoning and they don't know how to deal with it so they just laugh it off like it's a joke.

I even recently started to joke about not wanting to be alive to my parents. They ignore it. I can't tell my therapist because then I'll get hospitalized. The suicide hotline people all don't fucking care. One of them hung up on me. All of the other ones talk in complete monotone.

I feel like a piece of shit for even mentioning it. why should other people spend their time worrying about me in the first place?"
