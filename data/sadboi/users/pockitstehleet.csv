asktransgender,fqkqiii,t3_gjayx7,1589433512.0,"I experienced this, but in a retail setting.

Very few coworkers knew what I was going through in the lead up to my FFS. My GM knew and he was willing to tell my coworkers for me. I disappeared for three weeks and then came back, a still slightly swollen and slightly bloody mess. It definitely put off some coworkers, and while I didn't work directly with customers very often, whenever I did or had to be in a place where passersby could see me, I was stared at relentlessly.

After I had finally healed mostly, several months later my coworkers had gotten used to me and were much more comfortable with me and my changes. I'm still in the androgynous area though; 99% of customers don't know whether to address me as ma'am or sir and so they don't use either. The other 1% is a 50-50 chance of getting addressed as one or the other.

Tldr: depending on your results and how long it takes you to heal, will determine how others view you. We're humans, we're superficial. It's just our nature. If you can get you boss or boss's boss on your side, I think that it will definitely go smoother.

Also, if others think that you're vain for wanting to change yourself, to make yourself more comfortable in your own skin, just try to ignore them. They have no clue if what you've been through and are being judgemental by not even bothering to ask you and talk about it."
