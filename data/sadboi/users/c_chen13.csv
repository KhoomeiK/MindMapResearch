It's kind of sociopathic in my opinion, getting so much of someone's information and pretending to be them for your own enjoyment. He's in prison, he didn't intentionally ghost them from what I understand. You are getting in the way of this man and his families business. It's very rude. You could simply say it's the wrong email and not fuck with caring grandparents lives. You should reverse the roll on yourself and think about how your loved ones would feel talking to an imposter for their own enjoyment. I would be furious. I hope you the best OP, but every image I've seen you post on this is pretty fucked up in my opinion. They obviously care about their grandson regardless of what he's done. Leave them alone.
