>Or find another doctor.

This is my point, I guess. Should I? Or should I give up? Asperger's, or my presentation of it, at least, makes therapy pretty difficult as I've discovered I have no understanding of emotions and can't really identify them, not to mention speaking them aloud which is even more difficult for me."

tumblr,fpnronc,t1_fpn9x6c,1588771112.0,"Admittedly there is some debate on the topic of life expectancy. 

However there is also plenty to suggest that life expectancy was only marginally lower at worst (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.489.8781%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&ved=2ahUKEwiWo8PhnZ_pAhUrmHIEHSUfB4sQFjABegQIBhAB&usg=AOvVaw1SFlmUbpmwqlEPj0jZZf5U)[[50]. 

There is of course always the conversation about life expectancy being heavily skewed by infant mortality, which is very much the case for hunter-gatherers, an idea supported by both of our data. 

Additionally, this comes from the source which you linked:""The average modal age of adult death for hunter-gatherers is 72 with a 
range of 68–78 years. This range appears to be the closest functional equiva-
lent of an “adaptive” human life span."", Which places life expectancy near the modern life expectancy, partially excluding infant mortality. This is the reason I linked the source in the first place. 

If we are using life expectancy as a measure of quality of life, infant mortality is irrelevant. Additionally, life expectancy even in the Western world has only recently reached it's current heights, and has been much lower less than a century ago. 


>A 2010 paper argued that while hunter-gatherers may have lower levels of inequality than modern, industrialised societies, that does not mean inequality does not exist. The researchers estimated that the average Gini coefficient amongst hunter-gatherers was 0.25, equivalent to the country of Denmark in 2007. In addition, wealth transmission across generations was also a feature of hunter-gatherers, meaning that ""wealthy"" hunter-gatherers, within the context of their communities, were more likely to have children as wealthy as them than poorer members of their community and indeed hunter-gatherer societies demonstrate an understanding of social stratification. Thus while the researchers agreed that hunter-gatherers were more egalitarian than modern societies, prior characterisations of them living in a state of egalitarian primitive communism were inaccurate and misleading.[42]

I did not argue that hunter-gatherer societies were perfectly idealistic communist societies, only that the levels of inequality were far lower. Additionally, it is true that wealth transmission existed, but it existed in only 30% of tribes, as stated in my earlier source. 

>Also is disingenuous as it implies a group of 100 people would be able to scale their system up to a population millions of people without issue.

I did not say that it scaled up to a modern society. I had absolutely no intention of implying that it did. I was simply responding to the idea that our modern society is the best form of society our world has seen. 

>And this is to say nothing of the inherent misogyny of hunter gatherer tribes.

Inherent misogyny? While some hunter-gatherer societies were misogynistic, many (dare I say most) were largely not. It was common for women and men to be afforded equal rights.

Revise* 
That said, I am neither romanticising nor revising the past.

I fail to see how that is unproductive, and the researchers in the anthropological community appear to agree. 

>By virtually every metric our lives are much better than hunter-gatherers and feudalistic peasants. This luddite way of thinking is harmful, extremely priveleged, and brings nothing to the conversation.

You have cited nothing that makes this claim. In fact, you have not even made this claim yourself until this particular paragraph. That aside, I have demonstrated several metrics in which our lives either do not differ overmuch or their lives appear to be better. I also have not addressed feudalism at all, although many similar arguments could be made for feudalist societies. I fail to see how attacking me as priveleged adds to the discussion, although I don't deny that I am, within the confines of our modern world. I also reject the idea that it is harmful and brings nothing to the conversation. The anthropological researchers who dedicate their lives to studying this sort of thing certainly disagree.

I have just done a quick Google search for ""doctors find parasites in the Amazon"" and ""doctor visits Amazonian tribe"", and while the first yielded little of interest, the second yielded several articles warning that Western doctors were accidentally exposing Amazonian tribespeople to modern, Western diseases. I found nothing supporting your claim. As such, I would like to see you provide evidence for it. 

>Now we have surgery, vaccines, sanitation, and an understanding of biology which keeps us much safer.

We do have these things. To that extent, you are correct. However, as I've previously said (and cited, mind you), hunter-gatherers had similar life expectancies to modern people. Therefore, they did not need modern medicine to keep them safe. We now need modern medicine to keep us safe because we live in unsanitary crowded conditions with unhealthy diets and unhealthy lifestyles. In essence, because we live in the modern world which you hold so dearly. 



>If you’d like to go live in the rainforest or the African savanna, be my guest, but I’ll stay here in my comfortable apartment with my easy desk job. Sure, maybe it is a boring life at times, but remember that someone living as a hunter gatherer would have never read a book, traveled the world, learned about space or physics, driven a car, or indulged in any of the incredible luxuries we have in our modern world.

To my knowledge, there are no hunter-gatherer tribes currently residing in the African savanna. Of that, however, I am uncertain. There are some in Australia and the Amazon, I believe, but I don't think they're accepting immigrants at the moment.

Someone living as a hunter-gatherer would have told stories verbally, so you're correct, they would not have read a book, but they would have accomplished the same thing. They traveled plenty, truthfully. They did not learn about space or physics, drive cars, or engage in the ""luxuries"" of modern life, but they certainly didn't seem to mind.

Early societies were under little more threat of disease than we are under now. Under the current circumstances, many were probably less threatened by disease than we are now. Hence, similar life expectancies. 

It is true that they had none of our modern technology and knowledge. Yet, by many metrics, they had a better quality of life. They had more leisure time, certainly, and more wealth equality. 

They were under little threat of famine. Famine doesn't become an issue until the agricultural revolution, for the most part. And might I remind you that we are also under threat of famine? Three percent of the American population provides food for the other 97%. Any natural disaster hits, like the dust bowl, for example, and a lot of people will starve. 

War? Most tribes had little hostile confrontation with others. And when they did have wars, which, make no mistake, they absolutely did, the wars which they had were far less devastating than modern wars. 

In most cultures, women were not subjugated. That is simply a myth. In a few, yes, women were subjugated. Subjugation of women became widespread following/during the agricultural revolution for most of the Western world, at least, and it's worth noting that women were subjugated in the United States until approximately 50 years ago, long after most of the developments which we hail as having brought us out of the ""dark ages""(another myth, but that's another story) came about. 

Weaker members of the tribe were mostly cared for by stronger members. It was very, very rare for them to be left to die. There's plenty of research on the subject, I'd be happy to provide tomorrow, as it is currently almost 4 in the morning for be.

Hunter-Gatherers had life expectancies roughly equivalent to the modern life expectancy (https://www.academia.edu/17979487/Longevity_Among_Hunter-_Gatherers_A_Cross-Cultural_Examination)

Hunter-Gatherers typically worked 3-5 hours per day (http://www.eco-action.org/dt/affluent.html)

Hunter-Gatherer diets were widely varied, far more nutritious than most modern (Western) diets, and the human body is pretty much evolved for the hunter-gatherer diet. Numerous health concerns have been linked to the modern diet, as a result. (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.825.7981&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

Wealth inequality in Hunter-Gather societies is typically very low and wealth transmission between generations virtually nonexistent. Land ownership at all is very rare. As such, it is a highly uncapitalistic society with very high levels of equality. (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://faculty.washington.edu/easmith/Smith_etal_2010-CA_HG.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiG5oT_1Z7pAhVRYjUKHceIBpU4ChAWMAR6BAgGEAE&usg=AOvVaw3_7NBSwhc0syQoZ9IdW1Y-)

And that's not even to mention the environmental advantages of hunter-gatherer societies. It also does not include any information about later forms of civilization (feudalism in the medieval period, for example), which also tend to have granted people far better lives than is commonly thought.

I have a friend currently that's completely unlike anybody I've ever been friends with before and it's been difficult to learn to interact with her, especially since I have to learn from just her how to interact with just her. Luckily she's been patient and understanding, and she's very nice, but it isn't the first time I've been completely unprepared to interact with someone and I'm sure it won't be the last."

I personally went several years pretending I didn't have depression and there was nothing that I truly enjoyed. I just didn't want anybody to know. 

That said, if any of you are struggling, please don't pretend you aren't. You deserve help. I will always regret not asking for help and trying to hide instead."

However, you do not actually answer op's post. Yes, we vote for leaders, but our vote has practically no impact on legislation or the behavior of the government. A small group of wealthy donors have almost complete control over POLICY, which is what we're actually discussing, and to some extent they have a degree of control over who the officials are to a greater extent than do the poor. While OFFICIALS are popularly elected (kind of, the electoral college throws a monkey wrench into that one, too) their POLICY is largely enacted at the behest of a small group of wealthy individuals, not their constituents. Hence, policy is controlled by a small group of wealthy individuals, regardless of Democratic (ish) elections for leadership."

My house is completely filled with chaos and I'm stuck in the middle of it. I haven't ever been able to discern whether I come from an abusive family or a neglectful one, truthfully, and this whole situation is just bringing both sides to a head. I've been trying to distract myself with my only hobby, playing trombone, but that's apparently too loud (it never was until like literally a month ago. My entire family plays instruments). So now I don't even have that really. I'm so fed up with all of this and all of these people who have never cared about me and likely never will, although they insist on pretending they do in the most uncomfortable ways possible every couple months or so.

You can subtract 1x to get just the tax, which leaves 0.07x. That means the tax is equivalent to 7 hundredths, or 7%, of X. X is the price of the good.

MentalHealthSupport,fjdad88,t3_fcveh9,1583249201.0,"Hey, I was just like you just a few years ago. You're certainly not too young to be experiencing mental illness nor to seek help for it, if that's something you're worried about. I know it was something that I worried about a lot back then. Social anxiety is a real problem and I know how awful it can be, especially in (in the United States, anyway) high school. I found talking to my family really difficult, especially in person, but I was able to text a friend who encouraged me to get professional help and helped me to set up an appointment with a therapist without having to talk. If possible, I'd suggest you do the same. Therapy will be really hard at first, especially with such severe social anxiety, but most therapists will try to help you work through your difficulty expressing yourself and will go at your pace. They'll never make you do anything that makes you too uncomfortable, but they will push you to open up more in a safe space and help you to do so. If the first therapist you find doesn't do that or doesn't seem like they'll be able to really give you the help you need and deserve, don't hesitate to switch to a different one. They can help you with anger management as well. Assuming by not loving anyone you mean your peers in a romantic sense, you're still young and might just not have reached that stage in development yet. Everybody does at different times. You may also find that you never experience it, and there's nothing wrong with that. r/aromantic is a community full of people that never experienced it. If you meant people like your family, I understand that as well and would recommend speaking to a professional about it, if and when you eventually do see one.

You did the right thing reaching out. Good luck!"

""I know I smoke a lot, but I never want you to smoke. It's not good for me and it would be bad for you. I made the mistake of trying it and I can't stop. I don't want that to happen to you.""
