In which case you need to talk to someone in primary care, or potentially emergency care if this gets out of control, they should be able to offer more advice.

There is also brown leaves in every other season so why is it just related to autumn? If the colour of the leaves (the majority of them) during that season is the defining factor then shouldn't spring and summer both be green seasons?
