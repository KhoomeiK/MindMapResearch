depression,fiol2xn,t3_f8zruj,1582585348.0,"I don’t have the energy for a long uplifting answer or advice. All I can say is that I relate, I‘m sorry, and I‘m thinking of you right now. My life feels absolutely unbearable too; I don’t know what to do anymore. It‘s been hard for years. All I ever wanted was to be loved, but maybe that’s too much to ask for. 

I don’t know how or why, but I‘ll continue another day. Maybe I don’t need a reason for now, and maybe it’s okay to only focus on the next hour or even minute. My hope for you is that can somehow continue too – just in case things do get better after all."

WritersGroup,ezf5jrj,t1_ezf19h0,1567873278.0,Thanks for the explanations! Especially the fact that a permanent resident can actually leave their residency temporarily was something I hadn‘t thought of.
WritersGroup,ezedcss,t3_d0s949,1567862417.0,"As someone suffering from severe and chronic depression myself, I can relate very well to this poem, and I’m glad you shared it. It vividly expresses the overwhelming, crushing exhaustion one feels. 
What I found a little odd was the line “He seems to be a permanent resident now“, followed by “He is here longer than he is away.“ To me, this seemed somewhat contradicting. Is he always there or “only“ most of the time?
I’d also reconsider if referring to “the idea that I had of rock bottom“ as a mountain is really fitting. A mountain is high, sublime, impressive. Things might have got worse than you believed they ever could, but that doesn’t mean you formerly thought of rock bottom as a good place, does it?
Besides such details, the poem might be more intriguing if you incorporated more different aspects of depression. I feel that there is a little too much emphasis on and description of exhaustion, while other experiences commonly associated with depression, such as intense sadness, loneliness or low self-esteem, are hardly expressed.
I hope you find my suggestions helpful in some way. As already mentioned, I really like the poem overall.

PS: This has nothing to with your writing itself, but I sincerely hope you are better now and will not feel the way you did when you wrote this poem again."
