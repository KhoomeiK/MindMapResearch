But hey, throw some meme/twitter focus questions at the guys and get all those views on an extra episode. Go Netflix I suppose.

I like Joel McHale normally but the interviews felt stunted at parts. The relaxed play can work sometimes but when you're dealing with a doc with the severity of subject matter and interviewees known to run off on tangents or branch into things you probably don't have questions ready for, it's probably better to have some structure that isn't just end on the same question every time."

I'm listening to it more for the conversations between Jenna and Angela though so their tangents are kinda the point for me. I don't see where else they could go with a podcast like that apart from going off on stories and tangents from their time on the show and surrounding elements.  


If I listened to someone dryly explain the office to me episode by episode without these tangents and extra stories? I think i'd end up hating it."

What normally helps is to have someone to speak to openly about that problem/issue but due to some recent circumstances i have lost that person for good. My counselor is stepping in where they can. I find keeping a notebook/journal of my feelings and when they happen help massively with this as well as the code of conduct. Having it as a physical thing in my pocket to pull out and effectively chastise myself is very useful."

As a professor you teach at a college.

You are a College Teacher.

Don't put down the rest of teachers in the world just because you have hang ups about the word.

EDIT: I actually find it amazing as a TEACHER, you also don't seem grasp the concept that using a word that has context to a younger person (such as teacher to a child) would be a good way of *teaching* them something new.."
JustNoSO,f81olfl,t1_f81o6jv,1574173577.0,"It was never worth it not for a second. 

At the time I had no idea why I did it. My current thought is that I was so desperate not to lose someone so amazing I was scared her happiness and my self deprecating mind set were at odds and I'd just be left behind and alone. It's not a nice explanation and I'm in no way proud of it. I'm willing to challenge the very thing I am to become a better person and work to never do it to anyone again so that involves asking myself these questions a lot. I don't know if I'm getting the right answer but I'll keep trying until I do.

EDIT: Part of the reason I'm on this sub is to see the things people do and how to recognise them in myself to challenge them. I don't want to be a monster forever."

JustNoSO,f819m4r,t3_dye4bk,1574157313.0,"Hi, JNSO here.. hoping to one day be a JYSO.

I'm new to this sub so apologies if i say anything wrong or don't understand certain things.

My SO broke up with my this week and it has destroyed me, the worst part is i cannot blame her for doing it.

The crux of it was that i've got some issues and although these are no excuse for how i've acted, they have contributed as to why. I have issues with my father, my relationship with my mother was abusive and my last serious relationship was one in which i knew my partner had been cheating for numerous years but I kept quiet about it because i was... well i'll be honest, i was too scared  to be alone.

After that, i met, who we'll call ""L"". L was great in every way, she was and is perfect. She cared for me, was supportive, knew how to make me laugh, smile. She was my sanctuary like no one else had ever been.

I fucked that. I was argumentative. I let issues with anger and frustration come between us. I was never physically abusive, i would never and could never do that to anyone. But, if she was happy, i would cause an argument. I would shout, be snappy or even just make vindictive selfish comments. I never meant any of them and i regret saying every single one. Unfortunately that doesn't matter and what's said is said.

She has left me this week and it's absolutely destroyed me. I'm having to find somewhere else to live hurriedly, I don't know where i stand. The biggest thing that breaks me is that i was already taking steps to improve but there was a lapse. I saw a note she had written, asking someone else to go on a date. I freaked out and panicked. I got scared and i got argumentative again. IDK. I think all the past feelings came flooding back in one big go and i was terrified to lose her. It was the last straw. She explained that it wasn't a note ""to someone"" but rather just something she had written because in her days of frustration with me she had imagined what it'd be like to be single and wrote that note. I'm okay with that to some degree, i'm not okay that iput her in a position where she felt like she wanted to do that but that's on me, not her.

So, here's what you're asking. What am i doing to fix myself?

Well. I've started counselling, I tried to do this earlier in our relationship but the waiting lists for these kind of things where i live is just ridiculous. I'm going to anger management causes, i've written myself a very strict code of conduct that i'm going to try and live by. It involves things like how to talk to people, moments to stop, recognizing triggers and the like. I'm not explaining it well but it's a very strong thing and i carry it with me at all times now. I'm usually one who hides my feelings, doesn't speak to people but right now i am trying to get hold of anything and anyone that'll help me not hurt people i love anymore.

I have no idea if these changes are ever going to make the difference and to be honest, right now, every single day is getting darker. I don't know if i'll ever ""get her back"" and if i'm being brutally honest with myself i don't deserve to. She deserves so much happiness and so much joy. I know i have to do this for myself but it doesn't seem worth it... 

If anyone else has any advice of how i can become a better person, i'd more than happily accept it."

My only advice is that you can't choose your family and the bonds people say you have to have with them are entirely optional. It'll take time but you can build your own family from other people in your life. 

Most importantly, don't blame yourself. You can see from your post you see this as unreasonable already, don't let it get to you too much and concentrate on building your own family through friends if you can."

Use it as an opportunity to grow your independence too, with time you should almost be able to preempt what your counsellor/therapist would say and not even need that call. You can just catch up on it in the next session and then you get that awesome feeling of saying ""yeah it was shit but I did this and I fixed it.""."
depression,f7tj6xo,t3_dxnt6r,1574004841.0,"Love and hope to your relationship, they're precious. Never forget the support you've both felt throughout it.

With my ex if I was down I found I got snappy.. I try to isolate myself to avoid this. Maybe it's worth asking if he needs the space or the knowledge that he's not affecting you. If it's the latter, I know the thing that always helped me was just a simple ""I'm here for you."". It helped me keep that connection and over time, even some of my darkest days were made better by sticking to plans with my partner."
depression,f7thzxw,t3_dxnpy1,1574004536.0,"I got that for a while. My old counsellor wouldn't bother as so much as a ""why"" if I said I was cancelling or rearranging. It felt like she was meeting her professional obligation and that's it.

I switched and my current counsellor is much better. She even offered me 3 ""S.O.S"" calls. No matter if I cancel for 3 months on the bump or what, if I really just need that other side of the phone (and its between the hours of 9am-5pm, let's be fair she's a counsellor, not a saint. She has to have limits too.) She can be there for me to talk through what I'm going through and her best advise to calm me in the situation. When I go I hope it doesn't make her feel like she's failed because she's pretty good."
depression,f7t8fpv,t3_dxn69n,1574001889.0,"Doesn't sound like you saw a good therapist given the main difference between sadness and depression is that the sad person knows what they're sad about and it's usually external, they may be sad about a breakup say but that doesn't necessarily affect how they think of themselves. A depressed person cant put their finger on the reason and it does make them unhappy with their self.

Try different therapists. That's my best advice."

depression,f7p7d59,t3_dxdrfq,1573944014.0,"How long have you been on the prozac for? I found after a few days the nausea went away on it's own but the insomnia didn't clear for a little while after.

Not entirely surprising but I used to force myself out on runs alot, helped stop me doing anything stupid. That certainly helped with the insomnia but only as long as I finished up the run an hour before I went to sleep otherwise it woke me up more. My basic advice with insomnia is not to force it and if it starts stressing you? Leave your bed. Nothing worse than turning it into a stressful area, you'll only associate it with the trouble of getting to sleep rather than comfies.

Edit: oh and weed but given the circumstance you'll have to weigh up whether that's right for you."
