SuicideWatch,fm83fvg,t1_fm8363q,1585842081.0,"It’s almost terrifying how our brains could just decide to self destruct due to extreme stress and sadness. The weirdest part is that we seem to both recognise that suicide is a tragedy when applied to others but not ourselves. 

What am I going to do? Maybe I’ll try to get better until I can’t and the suicidal thoughts overwhelm me again. 

You?"
SuicideWatch,fm825jv,t1_fm7km5x,1585841372.0,Thanks... Why are people on the internet so much kinder
SuicideWatch,fm821e2,t1_fm7q3gu,1585841308.0,"You could reverse it if it’s only been going for a few months. Of course it’s going to be hard, but doable. For me, I was never a happy girl and it got worse 5 years ago, then it’s turtles all the way down from there"
SuicideWatch,fm7pd8t,t1_fm7or67,1585833747.0,"You seem like a nice person. It’ll probably be the world’s loss to lose you. At least I care about you being alive. Give it maybe a few days? And when your head is clearer, I hope you’ll make the decision to throw away the poison. But if you don’t, I totally understand."
SuicideWatch,fm7o5cm,t1_fm7nzet,1585832871.0,But at least I wouldn’t hurt any innocent people in the process. There have been cases where people jumped off a building and killed someone else while staying alive
SuicideWatch,fm7m0oj,t1_fm7kfa9,1585831244.0,Tied a noose around my neck... Too afraid to actually step out and partially suspend myself
selfharm,fliroax,t1_flirnfz,1585189094.0, No problem bro
selfharm,flirfdv,t1_flio3tz,1585188930.0,"It could potentially be easier but it’s still hard to quite self harm. Heck, who self harms for aesthetic reasons anyway, it’s almost always because of overwhelming emotions. Just that this by- product of self harm could serve you in the future"
selfharm,flinvp3,t1_flinlf2,1585186620.0,"At least there’s something positive to it. Try turning that energy into designing new patterns to something like carving, sculpting etc. If you could do these instead of self harm every time you have urges, your brain might just start associating whatever you do as relieving as self harm.  This problem of enjoying designing scars could potentially provide an easier grounds for quitting."
selfharm,fline17,t1_flina25,1585186302.0,"You know... I still have no idea why tattoos are ok but self harming is not. Probably because one of for aesthetic reasons and all that. Still though, props to you, people may say that being “proud” of your scars make you cut more but I think it does the opposite"
SelfHarmScars,flifhv1,t1_fli46qi,1585181414.0,Thanks
SuicideWatch,flifgkq,t1_flibrut,1585181392.0,I’ll try... I understand how painful it is to lose someone to a suicide. And that has been my only motivation
selfharm,flhfgmh,t3_fopljy,1585161648.0,Not proud I’ll say... More like... It’s a part of me like my pimples... You’ll hide them at first but it gets tedious and no one actually notices these small things anymore
SuicideWatch,flhe9mk,t3_fir9m2,1585161029.0,"Another point of view though... 

Maybe some of these people who say that have someone they knew died committing suicide. They feel guilty as they believe they could do something to prevent it (and it’s probably true), at the same time though, they don’t want to admit that they’re bad. This cognitive dissonance then drives the brain to find a plausible solution to all of this- that maybe it’s the person who committed suicide who is the monster, who is bad, who is selfish here, and it’s never about other people like themselves"
