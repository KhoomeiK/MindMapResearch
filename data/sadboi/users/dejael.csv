example: i grew up in the shitty house of my dad for my first 7 years of life. looking back on how we were treated ( fed once a day, made to walk home from school 2 miles away sometimes, beat over simple shit) it certainly seems traumatic, but to be honest i dont think it has effected me in a traumatic way and the only time i think of those memories is when im having a hard time and i need to tell myself im stronger than the situation. 

however, if you put someone else into the exact same situation, it may be traumatic to them. the definition of what is traumatic is completely subjective, so even though an experience might be simple and calm to you, i can imagine that some people still do suffer traumatically from them.

the chem. sunscreens will protect your skin, nothing else. it will not moisturize, it will not soften, and if used everyday it could arguably be toxic if youre sensitive, but a true american spf will not let ANY sun reach your skin if you keep it dry. 

as much as i love purito and other min. spfs, they arent comparable to chemical spfs AT ALL in terms of garuanteed protection. its like like ibuprofen vs morphine, you can use on everyday and be fine, but in extreme cases, the weaker one wont hold up and you NEED the stronger one. thats just my experiences with it though, hope if helps."
