Anxiety,fh8r5pm,t3_f1s25w,1581365674.0,"I’m long out of school and I still get this feeling, as do most people. The reason this happens is that your body has an automatic “fight or flight” response designed to help make you stronger and faster. Unfortunately it can feel extremely uncomfortable! The good news is that you can learn to recognize it and speak in public even when you feel it. When I have to give a presentation at work, I still get the racing heart and even fears like “I can’t do this.” But sure enough, I can, and I do. The positive side of the same coin is that you can channel this automatic response to be “positive” - this is easier said than done, and I’m still working on it. You can train your mind that when you feel those feelings, you say to yourself “I’m excited!” It might not be true, but it can help you start to be less afraid of the feeling."

Anxiety,fb6z72m,t3_ebp2pe,1576566125.0,"Mine got better! Over time I’ve learned more tools to help understand and cope with anxiety. I can typically notice my anxiety levels increasing earlier and start to take steps to feel better. And when I don’t feel better, I’ve learned the patterns and that I always get through it. That helps. My health anxiety has gotten better because I’ve had enough experience with it now to know that my “symptoms” will probably go away shortly (eg I made up a saying for chest pain - when it hurts, wait for burps - because it’s always been gas). My social anxiety is getting better too because now that I’m in my 30s I’m realizing that most people in my life are less judgmental and more forgiving than I assume."

Anxiety,f0h66u5,t3_d4vkbm,1568613844.0,"One more thought - don't let this dissuade you from driving generally! As you keep driving and have more experiences where you feel ok, your brain will learn that there's no need to panic. If you start to avoid it, you'll be reinforcing the fears."
Anxiety,f0h5zp7,t3_d4vkbm,1568613707.0,"When I've had panic attacks in ""active"" situations like this - eg when I can't just stop what I'm doing - the technique that works best for me is ""grounding."" It's about forcing yourself as much as you can to come back to the physical reality around you, instead of the thoughts in your mind. For example, concentrating really hard on what you can see, or maybe on how the steering wheel texture feels, or how the music sounds, etc. The breathing techniques signal to your body that it can start shutting down the panic process, and the grounding helps you manage the tunnel vision and thought spiraling we get during anxiety attacks."
Anxiety,f0h5nnt,t1_f0gybcv,1568613481.0,"The paper bag is intended to help you restore the correct balance of CO2 (because when we start to panic and breath really fast we take in aot of oxygen, which is fine but getting the balance back can help you feel a bit better). Instead of a bag, I focus on getting a good exhale when I realize I'm starting to panic (instead of a big inhale). 4 seconds in 5 seconds out works well for me."
Anxiety,f0h4uqe,t3_d4u5g9,1568612960.0,"Hey, I hope you're feeling better now. I just want to let you know that I've had a lot of intense health-related anxiety attacks, and it has gotten better over time. It's so easy to imagine the worst case from any symptom. I have a bad habit of linking unrelated symptoms together (e.g. oh I hit my arm AND my leg hurts! That must be related""). But now, after dozens of times doing this kind of stuff, I'm able to say ""hold on a second, I've had this same feeling and fear before, and each time I thought it was something awful but then it was nothing."" So now, I can usually keep myself from spiraling. It's taken a while, but I hope that brings you some comfort."
