So, do a bit of research, and figure out what you want to do in the game. Look up Xynode Gaming. He's a content creator for ESO and has lots of different builds.

Right now, I have 4 toons on NA server, and 1 on EU server, all different races and classes. 2 are dps, 1 is a healer, 1 is a tank, and the last one will probably be strictly pvp. IMO, you need to play past lvl 25 in order to really understand the class and skills you're playing/using, or you'll never find what you like. Just try stuff out, and you can always re-spec your attributes and skills later. Once you have 1 toon past lvl 50 and start accumulating champion points, all other toons will roll over to whatever cp lvl you are once they hit 50. Just remember, ESO is not like WoW.

I've been doing this long enough to know that the replacement that is suggested by IC isn't always a correct one. Making replacements takes common sense. Get the closest thing you can to the item they want. If they don't let you know in-app (because some will) that they don't want the one you chose, explain at the door and make refunds accordingly. Very simple. Actually telling someone what was out of stock at the door, usually will stop them from marking it missing. Don't just walk up and hand them their groceries. Giving them the low down of what choices you made, let's them feel in the loop and let's them know you cared about their order, and still gives them the control to accept or deny your choice. Grocery shopping for someone is a lot more intimate than going and picking up a bag of burgers for them. You get a look at their life. And food, what they buy, can tell you a great deal. Yeah, some customers are genuine, entitled assholes, but most aren't. They're regular people like you and me... But A LOT OF PEOPLE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO TIP PROPERLY. IF I CAN GIVE MY PIZZA PERSON A $5 TIP FOR BRINGING ME A PIZZA, YOU SHOULD AT LEAST TIP YOUR GROCERY SHOPPER MORE THAN $2, OR NONE AT ALL. START AT 10%.
