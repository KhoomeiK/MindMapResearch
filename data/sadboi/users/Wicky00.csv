insomnia,fqzz1is,t3_gk609u,1589779065.0,"This happened to me about a month and a half ago. I eventually fell asleep for a few hours. I was up for like a week and didn’t feel tired. I eventually got Ambien because without it I can’t sleep. I haven’t taken a sleeping pill in 2 days and managed to get some sleep, which I’m happy about."
insomnia,fqzdaiv,t3_glqvkc,1589764960.0,Good for you! I’ve been sleeping pill free for 2 nights now. I decided to try to sleep on my own and it’s been good.

insomnia,fqkqwuu,t1_fqhms67,1589433812.0,Would you recommend lunesta? I’m having sleep issues and have to take an ambien every night to get to sleep. I’m looking for a long term option because I don’t know when my sleep will get better.
insomnia,fqgncw6,t1_fqgjk19,1589351084.0,"How’s the restoril? I’m also researching about this to see if it’s a good choice for me. Also, how’s the zopiclone too? Which gives the best sleep."
insomnia,fqgd8r7,t3_gihg57,1589343347.0,Ambien works for me and I have no side effects.

insomnia,fpugdb6,t3_gf4m85,1588912211.0,I’ve been getting them everyday for about two months. It’s been ruining my sleep.
insomnia,fppkxej,t1_fpp3slj,1588804187.0,Ok. I was thinking of asking my doctor to switch me to Lunesta since I can use it long term. I don’t know when my sleep problems will get better so I’ve been looking for options that will help me sleep at night.
schizoaffective,fppkr0y,t3_get7op,1588804093.0,Thank you for this.

insomnia,fpovkwe,t3_gefetl,1588791404.0,I used to be able to sleep without problems. Now I don’t really get sleepy. I can go days without sleep and won’t even feel sleepy. It concerns me. I take ambien to sleep and it helps most days.
insomnia,fpmfb6m,t3_gdsouf,1588731824.0,"I was diagnosed with schizoaffective about 5 months ago and I’ve only started having sleep problems since April. I’m concerned because I’ve never had sleep problems before and I keep having loud thoughts and ramble on and on. It’s very tiring, I miss the days where I could sleep for 8 hours no problem. I’m currently on ambien for sleep and it helps sometimes and puts me to sleep for a few hours. I’m going to try cbd oil to see if it works. I hope you feel better."

insomnia,fpeikh3,t3_gcybwd,1588548237.0,This happened to me last night. I was relaxed and had rain sounds playing with my eye mask on so the daylight doesn’t bother me. I feel kinda rested but sad that I didn’t get any sleep. Every time I slipped into sleep my body would jerk and I would get this jolt of energy and we wide awake.
insomnia,fpbcr9x,t3_gc5vfq,1588467049.0,I’m on 200mg of Seroquel for sleep but it doesn’t help so I take an ambien. I take 100mg of Seroquel to calm me down at night because before bed I’ll start to get anxious. I hope everything works out for you.
mentalillness,fp89t2h,t3_gbt432,1588387065.0,I’m accept that I have mental health issues. I’m trying to maintain my relationship with my boyfriend and it’s been pleasant. I hope you feel better and things work out for you.
schizoaffective,fp89mev,t3_gbvlse,1588386942.0,My doctor tried to get me on depakote. Once I saw the side effects especially the one about hair loss I refused. I’ve been on risperidone at it’s been cool. I’m having sleep problems and Seroquel has helped with my anxiety although it was prescribed for sleep. I’m currently on 10mg of ambien for sleep and it helps most days.
insomnia,fp779m9,t3_gblqqt,1588365338.0,"I used to be able to daydream about different characters I loved in anime and movies to get myself to sleep, but since being diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder I can’t sleep without prescription medication."

schizophrenia,fp4pvtj,t1_fp4p6h8,1588304492.0,I got into a lot of mysticism and alternative spirituality like Hinduism and shamanism. I believed in spirits and had a voice but I thought it was a “spirit” tell me that he was my soulmate and just kept talking to me.
bipolar,fp4nfv5,t3_gb78oy,1588302896.0,"I’m on 200mg and worry about the weight gain as well as other side effects. I’ve done some research and it seems if you’re on higher doses for longer periods of time, you’re more prone to side effects"

schizophrenia,fp4n700,t3_gba3ws,1588302740.0,I have an obsession with Eazy E. I believe we were soulmates in a past life and can’t stop thinking about him. I want to learn everything about him.

insomnia,fp4m67d,t3_gavouo,1588302093.0,I can relate. It’s been happening to me every night for a month now. It keeps me awake all night. The only thing that helps me sleep is ambien.
schizophrenia,fp4m23p,t1_fp4j2uy,1588302024.0,I have no friends besides my boyfriend and family members.
insomnia,fp3vp6d,t3_gb4ire,1588286682.0,I was prescribed it for insomnia but my body has been acting strange when I fall asleep. When I get to the point of falling asleep my body will jerk or I will receive a jolt of electricity. It has been happening before I was prescribed Seroquel. I take 200 mg at bedtime and it helps with my anxiety. I was concerned about the side effects but I read that you have to be on really high doses for long periods of time to see and side effects.
insomnia,fp3kud5,t3_gaz0g9,1588281074.0,I’m going through a similar problem. I used to sleep regular but for past month and a half I can’t sleep at all. I’ve been prescribed sleep medication which helps but if I don’t take them I can’t get to sleep. Know that you are not alone.
insomnia,fp3f538,t1_fp345rh,1588278224.0,After reading the links. I definitely suffered from Delayed sleep phase disorder all of my life and didn’t even know it. I also had sleep apnea as a child but had my tonsils and adenoids removed which fixed my sleep apnea. Now I can even fall asleep because my body will jerk. I don’t stop breathing at night but as my body falls asleep it will suddenly jerk or I’ll feel a jolt of electricity and it will wake me up and repeat all night.
insomnia,fp32cn6,t1_fp22fwm,1588271897.0,Glad you got some sleep.
schizoaffective,fp2q0vm,t3_gay2rf,1588265964.0,Seroquel makes me sleepy but never puts me to sleep. I like it although I’m concerned about the side effects. It was given to me for insomnia but all it has done is calm my anxiety when I start to hear voices.
insomnia,fp2jtfp,t1_fp26obz,1588262981.0,What are the side effects?
SuicideWatch,fp2jr7n,t1_fp1cnrk,1588262950.0,"I know my voices are always here but I just meditate and relax. I practice a meditation by Echert Tolle, where you listen to the voices and just remain calm. Let the voices come and just listen to them don’t think about what they’re saying and don’t react. When I found this meditation years ago it made me wonder about the world and how others may hear voices but don’t view it as schizophrenia; the voices that people hear tend to be negative because Tolle talks about the ego and negative self which is different than the real self which expresses love, compassion and creativity. My voices can’t say positive and loving things but my own inner thoughts and feelings are positive and loving. Makes me think about my own voices and the ego."
ambien,fp12mrq,t1_fosw1g8,1588222736.0,Have you used it for 10 years every night or on and off throughout the years?
ambien,fp12k94,t3_g97nzt,1588222684.0,Sometimes ambien doesn’t work for me at the recommended dose of 10mg. It’s frustrating but I just deal with it.

insomnia,fp0yn6a,t1_fp0wyxa,1588219932.0,Same. I get a solid four hours after taking an ambien. My sleep is sometimes refreshed after taking one. Last night I took one with my Seroquel and woke up felling more groggy than usual.
insomnia,fp0vcvu,t3_ganlhn,1588217763.0, Sorry I can’t relate. I’m currently battling insomnia and have been looking into long term medication solutions and came across Belsomra. How long have you been taking it and does it help you sleep?
insomnia,fp0utw2,t3_gamxdq,1588217422.0,No problem. I’m currently on 200mg of Seroquel that was supposed to help with insomnia but hasn’t since my body refuses to go to sleep and jolt even when I’ve taken medication. I’m also on 10mg of ambien for insomnia which knocks me out for a few hours.
insomnia,fp0ubpf,t3_gamxdq,1588217093.0,I was afraid of pills too until I accepted the fact that a lot of people like millions of people take pills for all types of things. I just happen to be one and it helps with my problems and just leave it at that. We’re lucky to live in a time where we have access to medicine that can help us with our problems.
SuicideWatch,fp0u2ep,t3_gak1p2,1588216926.0,"Know that you are not alone. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I hear voices and survived two suicide attempts. The first one killed my cat because I tried to set myself on fire in my apartment. I’m still struggling with the pain from that. Some days are better than most. Try distracting yourself. I heard the movie Extraction is good, it’s on Netflix. I’ve come to accept that I’ll always hear voices and just try to remain calm."
insomnia,fp0suk6,t3_gamxdq,1588216154.0,I’m going through the same thing right now. I feel like I’m falling asleep and as soon as I slip to sleep my body with jolt or my back will tense up waking me up and the process will repeat all night. I talk to a therapist remotely. I’ve been prescribed two medications to help me calm down and sleep. Seroquel to calm down and ambien to sleep. Again know that you’re not alone and I’m here for you if you need someone to talk to.
insomnia,fp0qd7n,t3_gake1n,1588214614.0,I can relate. I recently went five days without sleep until I took an ambien. You’re not alone.
insomnia,fp0q7ot,t3_gamxdq,1588214520.0,You’re not alone. Please calm down and remember to breathe. Do you have anything you can talk to calm down and sleep?

insomnia,fp0d6fn,t3_gabzg6,1588206991.0,I can relate! It’s been happening to me for more than a week. I take Seroquel to calm me down and ambien to knock me out. I hope you feel okay and everything works out.

insomnia,fooyk13,t1_fompwc7,1587949196.0,I pretty much do the same thing. I’ll just go sleepless for a few days. I don’t feel that tired at all but then I’ll take a sleeping pill to knock me out so I can recharge. I don’t like doing this but my body just refuses to go to sleep. Whenever I get to the point of falling asleep a part of my body will move and wake me up. It happens all night.
insomnia,folrj51,t1_folavus,1587868788.0,"I’m going thru the exact same thing. I take sleeping pills to help me sleep, and as soon as my body gets to the point of drifting off to sleep, my body has a jolt and I’m awake again. I just lay and relax as best I can. I put on rain and thunder sounds for background noise to help me relax and deal with what’s going on the best way I can."
insomnia,folnq3k,t1_foko75z,1587866264.0,Ambien really helps me most of the time.
