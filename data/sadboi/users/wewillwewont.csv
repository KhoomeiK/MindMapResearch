Coronavirus is a family of viruses. You would not be targeting the whole family. Instead you will be targeting the haplotypes in covid-19. They also do not have much reason to work on a SARS vaccine because there havent been reported cases since 2004. 

Im not saying a vaccine is guaranteed but it is most definitely possible. 

Think of it like this. Lets say grandma goes on a killing spree and they cant catch her. She dies a year later, why continue looking for something thats gone? Now her grandson is on a killing spree. The fact they didnt catch grandma doesnt mean they cant catch him.

I do agree; however, we need to make sure theyre not skipping over safety measures to get a vaccine out quicker"

3. See if there is a drive through option.  I did this with one medication; however, it would have been better to go inside based on the number of objects they flung into my car for me to sign and hand back....

4. Go inside. I recommend wearing sweats over a pair of shorts, a jacket, and easy to slip off shoes. Bring your own pen and hand sanitizer. If possible bring a stylus for the touch screen you pay with. Bring cash. Also wear a make shift mask (bandana, scarf). When you come home take of your shoes pants and jacket.

There are some tutorials online of turning a tshirt into a mask. Anything to cover your nose and mouth is better than nothing. A bandana works well too.
