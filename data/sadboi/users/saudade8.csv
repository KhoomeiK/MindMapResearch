BPD,fp5gu09,t1_fp5dcs6,1588328877.0,omg YES this is beyond relatable
BPD,fp5effq,t1_fp4qv90,1588326297.0,"I feel you. I also tried to hide how intensly I fell, but it seems like it led me nowhere lol
I'm sure you haven't lost the only person that will ever love you! I've also felt that, and sometimes still feel it, because yeah, it's a rollercoaster of emotions, but I'm sure that there are a lot of amazing humans on this earth that are capable of helping us feel safe and loved. And I know that we also have to make ourselves feel safe and loved."
BPD,fp5e0rz,t1_fp4nocp,1588325856.0,Thank you so much for sharing! I'm really happy for you and I wish you all the best luck on your healing journey
BPD,fp5dc4o,t1_fp4e442,1588325122.0,omg thank you
BPD,fp5d5ur,t1_fp42uvk,1588324936.0,"When he first told me, I went silent for almost a day. I didn't understand it at first, it made no sense to me. It only sunk in after a week tbh"
BPD,fp5cs7w,t1_fp4p6yr,1588324526.0,"Well at least you had a good time visiting new England haha
It's very funny, I also just replied to another comment in which I explained that I also thought me and said man were twin flames lmao. I went dooown on the spirituality path, I started to see ""signs"" from the universe to prove that we were indeed twin flames like omg I can't even"
BPD,fp5ck41,t1_fp4b6j9,1588324287.0,"Thank you soo much for sharing, what you said is very relatable. 
I also continued to think we are soulmates(actually twin flames but this is a rather specific term, making me even more crazy lol) until recently. And knowing myself, there is a small possibility that I'll go back to this belief lol hopefully not tho!
I wish you all the best in your healing journey and thank you for the advice!"
BPD,fp5c5pb,t1_fp42vox,1588323861.0,Thank you so much for sharing!
BPD,fp5bwyg,t1_fp4c3ag,1588323600.0,"Yes, well, I tried my best not to rely on him, because I knew from experience how that ends up lol. I was always checking how close he got, and tried to mimic what he was doing so that I wouldn't end up hyping myself up for something that wasn't actually there. But I guess that's why when he decided he wanted to end it i got so incredibly hurt and realized how much I was actually relying upon him emotionally"
BPD,fp59fcj,t1_fp4184q,1588320966.0,I'm very happy for you and thank you for the kind words!
BPD,fp59a32,t1_fp3ylks,1588320816.0, I actually thought about that lmao
BPD,fp596vs,t1_fp3p9ne,1588320723.0,"I really understand what you are saying. 
The initial feelings are indeed addictive, actually there has been studies that show that it does the same thing to the brain as cocaine. And this is yet another reason why it's so hard to give up. 

To be honest, I reached this reality because of time. What I wrote about happened at the end of January. And now it's may, so it was mostly the time that helped me understand my situation."
BPD,fp3pri3,t1_fp3mxur,1588283588.0,"Yes, indeed, it definitely felt like more than a month. 
And I also quit my job and stopped eating lol.
 I'm sorry that he said those things to you, no one should have to hear that.
And yes, it is very exhausting to start building again. 
Aaand yes, our feeling may be valid, just a little bit spiked lol. I tend to see this as a blessing as much as a curse :)"
BPD,fp3ijwj,t1_fp3hk5e,1588279916.0,"Thank you for sharing! That's what I'm trying to do now also. I had no alternative than come off antidepressants because of the quarantine, but next week I'm getting an online appointment to see a psychiatrist and a therapist :) hopefully things will get better"
BPD,fp3i1jj,t1_fp3expm,1588279662.0,"Yeah, honestly you may be right. But the way he left was extremely confusing to me, and all that situation was confusing asf. Blaming it on the BPD helped me get away from the pain and find a bit of clarity I guess. But then again, you may be right"
BPD,fp2vh7y,t1_fp2u0mu,1588268564.0,"Thank you so much, I also wish you well!"
BPD,fozq4jh,t3_gadzsv,1588194913.0,"Wow this is so accurate.
I do feel a lot that this disorder makes me the shittiest human alive. Oh well"
limerence,fon46t5,t1_fomzfn5,1587911832.0,"Can you explain a bit more about the trauma response and how did you find out?
 If you are feeling comfortable enough :)"
limerence,fon3to7,t1_fnb736k,1587911593.0,"Sorry for answering so late! Well if you would take your advice in my situation, than also take it in yours! It seems like our situations aren't that different :) 
I tried to get closure, but at a superficial level so to say, because I never would have known what was in store for me later lol. When he broke up with me I was in a state of shock and haven't completely understood my feelings in that moment. Later I did, and oh, man, the closure we had is by no means enough haha. And now we ve been NC for 2 months so I guess it would be kind of weird to just pop up and tell him all this but ...
 Go for it. Tell her. She has no reason to react badly, I mean I guess you are adults and she will understand. Your well-being is most important, and you are doing this for yourself <3 I'm sure nothing worst will come out of this!"
UnsentLetters,fnz8gw0,t3_g4plyk,1587388696.0,"I know it hurts. But this will teach you so much, you will learn so many lessons from your sufferings.

Trust me, when it will stop hurting, you'll see that the sun is brighter than it ever was before.

Take care of yourself, you are the only one that can truly do this! Take your time, and have faith that when this is over you will be able to feel truly grateful that you've been through this."
UnsentLetters,fnynxsz,t3_g4m39o,1587369247.0,"This is literally word by word the same thing I would say. I really understand what you are going through, even though we probably have different stories.

I always try to focus on the great things that this human taught me. As you said, he showed me what love is. He showed me how I am supposed to be loved by someone else. And even though he is not in my life anymore, this is such an important lesson."

I was wondering, did that help you? I've been NC for a month or so but I still get all the intrusive thoughts"
limerence,fmxlw82,t3_fxzxxd,1586467439.0,"I'm glad it's getting a little better. Maybe all this staying at home situation is for the best, regarding the limerence

Wish you all the best!"
UnsentLetters,fmxl44n,t3_fxunhj,1586467022.0,"It's really fascinating how so many people have been through this. Also me. I have lived this exact story. Like scary accurate. 
It's funny how we are all looking for the same thing, even though we think we're so different

Reddit really gives me hope sometimes, man"
