Makes for great background noise."

He overreacted and he mostly likely knows you are right (but won't admit it). On top of that, the entire thing is very sensitive because of his sister. Hopefully he will take a moment to calm down and realize that he is the parent in the situation, a leader, not a victim. I will say that you can sympathize with him (I know those were special because of your sister...but our daughter doesn't understand) and try and make it a family learning moment."

AskReddit,es1dcfi,t3_c5ek1s,1561494318.0,When I was first learning to drive I almost hit a squirrel. The thought of having killed something made me freak out a bit and cry. I didn't actually hit it though and we reasoned later that maybe I got it's tail. Fast forward to my birthday when my aunt gives me a squirrel dog toy with the tail cut off in a separate baggie. I was not amused.
