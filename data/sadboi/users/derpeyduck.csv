medicine,fp684yq,t3_gb7e3h,1588347794.0,"I was in the military, and see a lot of similarities in medicine. I would love to be a physician. I love to help people. I love to solve problems and learn and all that. I joined the military out of a desire to serve and see some things, something that also draws me to medicine.   


But there are also some things that come with the package that I swore I would never agree to once I left. The part about your time no longer being yours. I will never agree to a salaried position, or an on call position that doesn't come with some kind of pay or benefit differential. Because I ~~want~~ *need* that distinction between when I am working and when I am not, what I am being paid for and how much.   


The military can never unionize for obvious reasons, but leadership in both worlds seem to really appeal to your ""discipline"" and ""selflessness"" as a means to abuse you. Asking for things like basic human dignity and privacy somehow makes you less disciplined or selfless.   


I am not so invested in becoming a physician for a number of reasons, all of them are quality of life ones. I would love to learn all the nuances of the human body and use it to help people live their best life, but I really would rather not spend all my ""off"" time responding to MyChart messages or doing all the weird billing things.  Right now I have a union job that pays hourly and I love it. Yes, as a physician, you make a lot of money. But I, a medical assistant, make more than some residents when they break their pay down by the hour and output and that's a bunch of bullshit. Especially when it doesn't seem to come with much in the way of perks. 

&#x200B;

So the short of it is this: unionize, unionize, unionize. Do it. Yes, some unions can be shady but it was the union that made sure my husband got paid when his boss tried to weasel out of paying OT. My union is the reason why my manager will get in trouble for making me do anything work related while off the clock, and I won't be punished for taking time off or getting sick. You hear about the bad ones because they are the exception. You do not hear about the good they do because it is the norm. If I knew more about unions and how they worked, hell, I would volunteer to help you guys build one."
medicine,fp50dpn,t1_fp4xf9r,1588312370.0,"-It’s salaried. I know that’s lot of jobs are, but there’s no “on” and “off” work. You’re expected to be available at all times. Both talk a big talk about work-life balance, but also seem to frown upon getting sick or asking for time off. 

-The culture around mental health struggles is...odd. Like, both seem to acknowledge the impact that the job can have. They talk a big talk about getting help, then discharge people who do. So people are afraid to get help because it may end their career. suicides and substance abuse rates skyrocket, and the same leadership who preach about getting help and then punish those who do are baffled. 

-Being on call. Idk, I just kind of hated it. Especially when there was no real reward or incentive. If the admin doesn’t expect it, the patient sure does. Had one or two get pissed because they sent MyChart messages on Friday or Saturday, and received a response on Monday. 

-Basically, no expectation of privacy or autonomy. I was a corpsman and I could not always guarantee that my patients command would not find out about their issue, because I had no idea what the admin would (and could) do. I once had someone’s supervisor come to the clinic saying he needed to look through his guys medical record. He was utterly baffled when I told him he’d need to talk to my supervisor. 

-Appealing to your “selflessness” or “toughness” as a justification for abusing you. Basic human dignity and decency is seen as “coddling” that will cause the whole institution to crumble. 

Idk, the above are vague. I just sense a lot of similarities that compel me to stick to my hourly-wage Union job. Because my quality of life is infinitely better, even though it gets boring."

Then, somehow you’re reminded of that box. Maybe you want to put something else on the shelf only to realize that you don’t have space for it because the box is in the way.

MensLib,flpm53x,t3_fpt4gp,1585362835.0,"Also a woman, but I would argue yes for a different reason. Here’s my take:

I’ve been taught to fear or mistrust men’s sexuality growing up. “Guys are only after *one thing.*” “it makes them do terrible things.” 

Demons are understood to be a force that compels or “possesses” someone to do bad things. 

I think men’s sexuality is demonized in that many are taught to fear it, and in my experience, it is separated from the man himself. I grew up believing it to be a force that compels men to do harm. Makes a good man do bad things. It’s why many who have sexually harassed or assaulted women have not really been held responsible. There’s a trope about boners having “a mind of its own.”

Now, this is men’s lib, and those are the observations of a woman with some baggage. Take them with a big grain of salt. 

I have come to not see sexuality as a demon, in anyone. It is very much a part of being human and is not something to hide from or fear. Demonization is dehumanization. It may take different shapes between men and women, but harmful all the same. I am very curious about how men experience this demonization."

You can’t go wrong following Christ’s example. Jesus is kind. Jesus did not judge. He hung out with sinners. He built a big tent. He preached healing the sick, housing the homeless, feeding the hungry, welcoming the stranger. And you will find meaning on that path. 

On a more practical level, I suggest finding a church in your area that you like. There are many different flavors, and they tend to be welcoming places. A great way to overcome social anxiety is to socialize. The more you see people are just like you, the less of a hold anxiety will have on you."

medicine,fiag9w4,t3_f61fse,1582300420.0,"Not a doc or a mid level, but if I do go that route, I would opt for PA for the following reasons:

1. I actually want to be supervised. I used to be a corpsmen in the military, and my scope was essentially what the doc trusted me with. When I was deployed or assigned somewhere with no doc on site, I wasn’t really comfortable with that level of independence. I have a tendency to hyperfocus on the wrong things and overthink in general. Having someone to say “you can chill” or “yep, that is as bad as you think” helps a lot. 

2. The other is practical concerns. I’m 30 with a husband mortgage. A two-year program and undergrad makes a bit more sense financially and practically than undergrad, med school, and residency which might require moving a couple of times and lots of debt. 

So, from this maybe-future-PA, please stay the course. I will need you. I will be very grateful for you."

Pete_Buttigieg,fhg2z36,t3_f2udyu,1581557388.0,"My best friend is gay, and retiring from military service within the next four years. She was saying that she doesn’t want Trumps signature on her retirement certificate. 

She served while DADT was in effect. Her wife still followed her from state to state, but she couldn’t even be out. When DADT was repealed, spousal benefits for gay service members were limited. Then DOMA was repealed, and now her marriage is fully recognized by the military. 

Man, I can’t imagine what it would mean to her to go from her service being contingent upon staying in the closet, to having an openly gay commander-in-chief sign her retirement certificate.

Not the most broad stroke reason I support Pete, but on a very personal level, it makes electing him that much more meaningful to me. 

Would definitely vote for Bernie if he gets nominated though. She wouldn’t mind an autograph from him either."
CasualConversation,fheg5ke,t3_f2ds5m,1581521688.0,"I work in healthcare. Every time I see a patient I have to ask them their tobacco status. There’s always some guilt or shame when people affirm that they smoke. Like “I am trying SO HARD to quit!!!” 

“I know I need to stop.” 

I always go into cheerleader mode with them, and anyone at any stage of the struggle with addiction. Like hey, if you’re trying, you’re doing right by yourself. Down to half a pack from a pack? Progress! Was trying to quit, when tragedy struck? You’re a fighter, and YOU WILL GET THERE. 

I also weigh people at their appointments. Man, people hate the scale. They’ll say “I’ve quit smoking and so I’ve gained.” Ashamed of the weight gain of course.

And I’m like “hold up. *You quit smoking.* Do not for a second think these extra 5-15lbs are a bigger deal than that! Celebrate!” 

Quitting is a process, and every day, week, month, even moment tobacco free is a win in my book. Go get it!"
MensLib,fhef0nr,t1_fhcm26i,1581520976.0,Family SHOULD get in the way of work. It should be a given that you would value your family over your job FFS. Any employer who doesn’t understand that will never deserve the loyalty they claim to love.
Pete_Buttigieg,fh87eby,t1_fh72q2k,1581353664.0,"There are as many reasons as there are supporters. 

I personally like his emphasis on “how.” What a transition to M4A looks like. His plan, M4AWWI, *is* the transition. 

His message of unity and belonging resonates as well, and its evident to me that he really sees people. He also communicates it well. A very good example of that was his first town hall on Fox News, on the question of abortion. He said “let’s put ourselves in the shoes of a woman faced with this decision.” I’ve never seen that kind of empathy towards the women having the abortion, so that was a huge plus.

I also like the level of nuance he brings to the discussion. I’ve always gotten frustrated with politicians not really fleshing out their vision and strategy. As highly as I think of Bernie, I do wish he would explain his process a little more. Gonna take on Wall Street? Fantastic! How? What does that look like? Medicare for all? Sounds good, but how do we achieve that? What does the transition from what we currently have look like? (I’m a medical professional so this is close to me.) 

I think the 2016 election really demonstrated how people are sick of the same old shit. Pete’s emphasis on democratic reform speaks to that. Also, many of us just don’t have a whole lot of confidence in a leader that has been in Washington for decades, and Bernie is among them. 

As a mayor, Pete has never been able to hide from his constituents. A president who has had to face real consequences of the impact of their decisions in recent memory is refreshing. I would argue he’s just a touch more keen on how policies play out IRL because he’s been closer to it. (think of it as bridging “on paper” to IRL.)"
