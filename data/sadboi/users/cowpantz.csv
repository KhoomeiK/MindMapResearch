The prework out will wake you up. The walk will help with the depression. Then when you get back shower and clean and organize your stuff. Eat a good meal. Layer in more positive stuff after.

InsightfulQuestions,fags66e,t3_e93f3i,1576069565.0,"I think a better way to look it is opportunity is everywhere but you have to know what you want. I think this stuff is BS but I found success a different way. Brian Tracy put out a discipline book and I bought it years ago. The nugget I got from it was writing down 10 to 15 goals I want to achieve in the present tense as if I achieved them. I have been doing this for years and I find I am always hitting my targets. Theres something about thinking about and writing down goals that turns on your subconscious to look for said opportunities. I dont think its magic or any of that, but you cant get what you want or hope for unless you know what you want. You cant see what you dont know you are looking for. I find it a better way to go through life."
