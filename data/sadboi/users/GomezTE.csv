My best friend goes to a music school and his take on it is really interesting.

There are 2 main kinds of autotune, that if done correctly it's what makes the artist.

First one is the simplest, the autotune you don't notice. Sometime you're just so close to what you concider perfection, and you want to reach that point where it also sounds natural. Charlie Puth is a great example, his voice is already beautiful, but he has got pitch perfect hearing and feels the need to use autotune to bring it to perfection. This makes his singing beautiful.

The second kind is where it is done purpousefully, it can display things like artificiallity, or fakeness. Or it could bring a whole new sound. Blackbear masters this, a lot of his songs are about the shallow, artificial parts of our society. Upon that the way he uses autotune makes his singing stand out to the extent that you could have 2 autotuned songs and immediately find out wich one is blackbear."
