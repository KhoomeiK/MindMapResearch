BPD,fr15cf4,t3_glxqju,1589813553.0,"Have to agree with the other commenter and say this whole post made me feel pretty uncomfortable. 

BPD isn’t a “trait”, it’s an illness. People with BPD may act in similar ways but if you find the illness itself attractive then that’s really weird.

Imagine saying “i would find it powerfully attractive if a girl told me she had depression/anorexia/multiple sclerosis”. Gross."

BPD,fqac6dn,t3_gegovo,1589216557.0,"I’ve noticed there’s been a lot of “counter” posts on the sub in the past couple of weeks. Like, people making a post referencing a different post from earlier in the day, and they can get quite heated.

It started with a post about “symptoms of BPD people don’t talk about”, followed by a counter post from another person indirectly referencing the first one and going off about how “these aren’t symptoms, they’re bad personality traits/they’re symptoms of Narcissistic PD” (which may have been true, but was written pretty harshly). Then there was a post about how the sub stigmatises NPD, likely created because of the aforementioned post.

Then there was a post about the positive traits of BPD, which included how pwBPD are “empaths”, followed by an angry post basically titled “pwBPD are not empaths!”. There was also a post saying how the sub is a big circlejerk, how there are no positives to having BPD and pwBPD are terrible etc (in response to the “positive traits” post i assume).

Are these posts allowed? And what do the mods think of them in general? They seem very meta and i personally get tired of seeing them because they inevitably turn into people shitting on the referenced post and saying how much they hated the post/disagreed with it. It’s like one big weird vague argument within the sub with people making new posts about their opinion for validation rather than having a discussion in the comments of the original post."

BPD,fpsy77p,t3_gf94dg,1588881619.0,"Totally agree. Self diagnosis is incredibly harmful and i don’t agree with it at all.

Back in my Tumblr days everyone and their dog was self diagnosed with BPD. People (especially teenagers) latched onto the label because a lot of them could relate to some of the symptoms even a tiny bit. It was seen as one of the most severe mental illnesses and people LOVED competing to have the “worst” life. And it was constantly used as a get out of jail free card for shitty behaviour.

I wasn’t diagnosed at the time and although i ticked all the boxes for BPD i refused to believe i had it. I didn’t want to be associated with all the people sticking a BPD label into their bio to seem cool. I got panicked when my GP suggested i may have it and convinced myself i had tricked him into thinking that, that i’d faked all the symptoms the whole time and deluded even myself.

As another commenter said, focus on your partner and not what other people’s partners/loved ones have been like. BPD is so different for everyone. You know your partner and the things they will struggle with. All you can do is be there for them right now rather than getting worried about the future.

If you need more information about it, try to stick with reputable websites (i’m from the UK and the best sites for reliable info for me are NHS, Mind UK, and Rethink). Basically sites from charities or health organisations that will give you objective and helpful information rather than horror stories.

Finally i want to say that Reddit has a very extreme view of BPD and it is really harmful. Sadly you will see awful comments/stories about people with BPD in a lot of subreddits. But most of these people don’t know what they’re talking about and stick a BPD label on anyone who has treated them badly, whether they’ve been diagnosed or not.

Most of the people i’ve seen who have detransitioned have been biologically female and took male hormones for a few years. Once they stopped some things would go back to normal (although it would take a LONG time), but things like facial hair, face shape, and most notably their voice would never be the same.

If you search on Youtube you can find videos of female-to-male-then-detransitioned people and see just how deep their voices are. Unfortunately that’s one of the biggest things which will never go back to normal; they’ll have very deep masculine voices for the rest of their lives.

Edit: this is just regarding hormonal changes. Surgical changes are a whole different ball game, and i dread to think how many people got trans surgery and now regret that.

Most of them regret being pulled into certain communities when they were young and vulnerable. Some of them took hormones for years to validate their identity and are now left with irreversible body changes.

Just the other day i saw one of my old Tumblr friends post screenshots on Twitter of their old Tumblr “about” page with their MOGAI identities, self-diagnosed mental illnesses, and kin identities, amongst other things. They were cringing so hard at themselves, but ultimately grateful that they’d made it to the other side of that phase with no major damage done.

BPD,fn9n9va,t3_g0dlld,1586779167.0,"Yep. i always explain that if i were to kill myself i wouldn’t make a plan, it would just be on impulse. But they still consider that low-risk for some reason."
AskUK,fn83piw,t1_fn7hjnw,1586733245.0,I’ve always opened crisp packets upside down since i was a kid and i can’t even count the amount of people who have been outraged about it.
mentalillness,fn6k7vt,t3_fzr7go,1586701359.0,I wish i’d been taught ANYTHING about mental health. It wasn’t until i was a teenager that i found out that not everyone wants to die and being majorly depressed wasn’t normal.
Yogscast,fn6hugv,t1_fn6crnl,1586699691.0,How about leaving it up to the hospital to decide which masks are or are not suitable for use? Believe it or not medical professionals know what they’re doing and would not accept a donation of masks if they were unsuitable.
SubredditDrama,fn3zs22,t3_fza6na,1586631156.0,OP is travelling for a... “babymoon”..? I have never heard of that term before and yet i feel like i know exactly what kind of person would have one.
relationship_advice,fn1719r,t3_fylxen,1586556059.0,"How many rooms are upstairs? Do you have a bathroom/bedroom downstairs? i’m genuinely curious, it’s weird to me that you could live two months using only half the living space you have."
BPD,fn0vuad,t3_fyk16i,1586549740.0,"The way you act towards your boyfriend when you’re upset is definitely not good. You need to work on managing your feelings better and not taking it out on him. It’s good that you’ve arranged to see your psych/therapist, but you should try to work on it before then too if you can.

You might also need to talk to him and work out some compromises. Am i misunderstanding or is he playing games with his friends for 6 hours straight? I don’t think it’s unreasonable to be upset or irritated by that. Maybe he could split his gaming sessions into two shorter ones and spend some time with you in between so you’re not sitting around in your head for 6 hours? Just a thought."
relationship_advice,fmwwv7y,t1_fmwdons,1586454452.0,"Came here to say this. Someone who can't even clean a litter tray should absolutely not be fostering cats. And she has a kid?! What an awful human being.

Report her to the agency and then kick her ass out. I would say make her pay for the house to be cleaned but that fight probably isn't even worth the effort."
Nicegirls,fmvv9e7,t3_fxq1c0,1586432102.0,“Appreciate my harassment before it turns to passive aggression.”
leicester,fmvuv25,t1_fmvnvgr,1586431710.0,"I don’t like to snitch either but there’s a business visible from my window (which shouldn’t even be open since it’s very much non-essential or at the very least could implement work from home), and their employees are taking fag breaks outside in groups of 5-10 people at a time, several times a day.

I reported the business this morning. At first it felt petty but nearly 1,000 people died yesterday and people like this who think they’re above the rules are only going to make things worse."
BPD,fmvivb7,t3_fxn18n,1586418567.0,"Hey there. I experience similar things too. My old GP said it was mild psychosis secondary to my depression and BPD. By “mild” psychosis, he meant non-violent thoughts without hallucinations but he still took it seriously, which i really appreciated because i also feel really stupid when i explain my delusions to people.

I was told i likely also have Paranoid Personality Disorder as well as BPD. It might be worth reading into that and seeing if it might apply to you too? BPD and Paranoid PD often overlap so it may be more common than you think."
mentalillness,fmvicsy,t3_fxnodm,1586418039.0,"Hey first of all, massive props for managing to hold a job when things are difficult for you. That’s a huge achievement and you should be proud.

The people who are making you feel bad sound infuriating. Do your friends/family know about your mental illness? If so then a simple explanation that you needed a change of scenery while you got better should be enough.

Otherwise it’s nobody’s business what job you have and why. “I wanted a change” is a valid reason for anyone to switch jobs at any time. If you can manage to be assertive then straight up tell them “it’s none of your business/it was my decision/back off and stop asking me about it”.

And of course, don’t let anyone pressure you into moving too quickly before you’re ready. Always put yourself first and do what’s best for you."
AmITheAngel,fmvheaa,t3_fxl9dg,1586417064.0,"YTA, think of the poor mother and how she feels. You don’t know her situation! She might be the best mother in the world but just too busy to clean up all the time. Fuck those ungrateful crotch goblins, bet they don’t even help with chores.

mentalhealth,fmup2oq,t3_fxdzw9,1586395841.0,"Two of the big things that i think are important are being patient and non-judgemental. If your partner is having a bad episode, support them even if you may not understand why they’re feeling that way.

Ask them what they need. Everyone with mental illness is different and might need different support; something that works for other people may not work for your partner.

As for finding out more about their diagnosis/what they need, i think it’s fine to ask since you’ve been together for a few months. “Is there anything i need to know about? / how can i support you?” might be good questions to start with. If they’re uncomfortable or don’t want to talk about it then hopefully they will let you know.

Finally, look after yourself! Remember that there might be things you can’t help with, which can be frustrating, but be as supportive as you can without burning yourself out."

crazygirls,fms2esh,t3_fwyaht,1586344275.0,What kind of midlife crisis is she having where she feels the need to go off at someone she hasn’t been with for 16 fucking years??
HouseFlipperOfficial,fmpz9cu,t3_fw6z50,1586290020.0,"The latest update from the devs regarding workshop was in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseFlipperOfficial/comments/f0eoen/the_long_awaited_results_for_the_item_idea/) about 2 months ago:  


>For now, Steam Workshop support is something that we know we wanna do, we've done some research, we even involved our community with some decisions and opinions on it.The good news is that we're getting closer and closer to it, bad is that I have no idea when that might be ready. At the moment we are primarily focused on the projects we've been working on for the past months (HGTV DLC, console release, House Flipper VR). 

So looks like they'll work on it eventually! Sadly we won't hear any more about it until at least after the upcoming DLC is released."
TalesFromTheCustomer,fmpqkvv,t1_fmpkksu,1586285541.0,">I've been cringing at the clapping etc.

Oh me too. It's well-intentioned but it's just a fad that people are taking part in to feel like they're doing something to help. And I can't help but think that a lot of the people who are clapping are the same morons who abuse 999/A&E services for trivial things."
HouseFlipper,fmpgvca,t3_fwnslw,1586280605.0,"How big is the room? Some room types have minimum size requirements so you might need to make the room bigger.

Also some sofas register as beds. Try a different sofa to see if it changes."
TalesFromTheCustomer,fmp72bq,t1_fmov0nf,1586275639.0,"Same. I’m touched by how much support NHS staff are getting from the general public but some healthcare workers are definitely letting it go to their heads and acting like they’re better than other people.

I only have two big supermarkets within walking distance and one of them is practically empty in the morning. This week was even quieter and the shelves were packed."
TalesFromTheCustomer,fmp4pts,t1_fmow9hu,1586274395.0,Because of the 2 metre rule I think I was probably the only one who could properly hear her but I'm terrified of confrontation so i was useless lol
HouseFlipperOfficial,fmm2wdh,t3_fvzrqv,1586197781.0,"Yes! This is the number one thing i want from the game right now.
 
I don’t know how it’d work but i’m picturing being able to create a floor plan from scratch, set the room dimensions, place windows/doors/stairs, choose how many floors the house has etc. Then the game generates the house from that."
AmITheAngel,fmm1m04,t1_fmll08q,1586197106.0,People who are this far up their own arses do not feel shame.
AmITheAngel,fmkg7rb,t3_fvr82u,1586153886.0,"So many “NTA, you go guuuurl!!” comments. The guy is obviously a massive dickhead but OP sounds so childish.

“I’m so checked out of this relationship lmao” ok... so break up with him instead of searching for asspats on a tiny peepee joke?"
