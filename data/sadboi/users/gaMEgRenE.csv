Who shit in your cereal this morning? I wasn’t asking for a philosophical discussion, by not filling it in I’m not directly voting. Your interpretation is what you want, but I’m giving the succ to idiot Dems who are hurt, and evidently leftists are hurt by that too. Not quite sure how I can appease anyone on the left when centrists are too busy claiming they’re the essence of the party, and insistent any lesser action is inconsequential.


Nt tho, I love reading comments where it’s evident someone was frustrated. Mission accomplished ✅


E: An older redditor; it’s evident you’re uninitiated with political discourse. Keep it close, but quiet. You’re uninformed and unfortunately equally enthusiastic, much like the DNC"

How can you write these comments and not realize how conceited you are? Seriously, scroll back up dude. You’re so excited about shooting yourself in the head and it’s left me bewildered. Imagine having enough critical thinking to realize trump is bad, yet lacking enough to realize the alternative is also bad. Keep squealing, I’m really enjoying this show of centrist bravado"
