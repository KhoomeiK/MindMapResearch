relationship_advice,fo5icga,t1_fo5i3g9,1587526356.0,i wasn’t throwing digs at OP and i definitely don’t think the roommate is in the right at all. i never justified the roommates actions. i’m saying that i don’t have any insight about the next steps they need to take to protect themselves and maybe getting an outside perspective from a trained professional could give them more insight than random people on an app. leaving unhealthy relationships is extremely difficult so i thought i’d share that my therapist helped me remove myself from toxic people.
relationship_advice,fo5i4iz,t1_fo5ho5h,1587526204.0,"ya that’s valid, i think it’s natural to feel that way. try to think about it as him using the coping mechanism that he had at his disposal in that moment instead of him not believing you’re worthy of affection. and if you need to sleep on the couch in order to physically calm yourself then honestly go for it (as long as you’re not doing it to be petty), and then explain your choice to him tomorrow. i think if you guys explain your defense mechanisms to each other it would help you both not to take things personally and understand each other."
relationship_advice,fo5hvjk,t3_g5tjtr,1587526028.0,"if i’m being honest i don’t know what your next steps should be so i want to ask - i mean this in the kindest way - do you have a therapist? im asking because everyone needs a therapist - especially during times like these! my therapist has helped me navigate complicated relationships to people i’m close to (especially toxic ones) and i feel like it would be a great added support while you try to navigate this. there are a lot of moving parts and feelings that need to be accounted for, and it would be best if this could be dealt with as delicately as possible. if you don’t have one there are a lot of online services and i’ve heard there are therapists willing to offer discounts right now. i wish you the best!"

it seems like there were hurtful comments said about him as a person. if he’s the type of person who needs space while they’re hurting than that makes sense for him to not want to cuddle. you feeling hurt by that choice is also valid bc it makes you feel isolated but i don’t think it’s black and white about who’s wrong and who’s right."
