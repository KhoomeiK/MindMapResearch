She must have been in a house before and punished for jumping up onto things. In the beginning, I had to pick her up and show her that being on the couch is okay.

A psychiatrist or even a regular doctor can help you. What's happening to you is as much physical as it is mental. It's difficult to bring your mind out of a spiral when your body is in flight mode and flooding you with cortisol. A doctor can prescribe you at least a couple of days worth of something that can bring you back to normal enough to be able to deal with the mental shit. 

 I had one so bad that I didn't go to work for 2 days then through the weekend. I spent the next week just trying to stay calm but failing. I had diarrhea everyday and threw up twice during that time. People at work kept telling me I was pale and asking if I'm alright and I wanted to crawl out of my skin.

And then I realized I am thinking too much on what the other person might be feeling and therefore I feel out of control of the situation. I am spending too much effort trying to go with the flow for an interaction that hasn't really happened yet.

There are lots of funny comics and posts about how other people misunderstand mental health.I thought it was funny at first until I realized there were also many people who just wanted to be miserable and stay miserable. Unfortunately, advice like ""go exercise"" only makes sense when you are on the other side. From the point of view of a depressed person, it seems like the person giving you the advice is brushing you off with an ""easy fix."" It's not the case at all.

When you are depressed or anxious, you lack motivation. You get out of it by *doing it anyway* \- the motivation comes after when you see that it works. No one can make you believe it works until you try it.OP, I recommend r/EOOD"
