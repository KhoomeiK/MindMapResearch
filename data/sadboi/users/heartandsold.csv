vegan,fq4x8vl,t3_ggv5ao,1589086426.0,One tip tho - i have found that vegan cheese melts best with steam so by covering the grilled cheese u will get it to melt best!
vegan,fq4x7bb,t3_ggv5ao,1589086393.0,i personally really like the follow your heart brand of american cheese !!! and also the miyokos brand cheddar is very creamy too!
SmolBeanSnark,fq1knh4,t1_fpyss5z,1589046499.0,exactly !!!!
realhousewives,fpxs5gq,t3_gg5uyw,1588988474.0,yes
SmolBeanSnark,fpqdbhn,t3_gelp9q,1588820250.0,i feel like these are fake tho bc didn‚Äôt someone just post something like this but different the other day
BorderlinePDisorder,fpqco2v,t3_geyef3,1588819844.0,yes
vanderpumprules,fppjfb9,t3_gep6ph,1588803386.0,i‚Äôve been rewatching and it‚Äôs so noticeable i can‚Äôt believe i missed it before. katie really just tries to keep the peace / go w the flow but really really lets stassi really get to her. it‚Äôs unfortunate because i really like stassi.
vanderpumprules,fppj7uf,t1_fpp16nj,1588803275.0,literally. like it‚Äôs not like u are out of control and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. but jax has shown in the past that he has absolutely no self control
SmolBeanSnark,fpl0ago,t3_ge3383,1588704120.0,can someone link me to her airbnb profile i want to see it
vanderpumprules,fpi7oei,t1_fpi1m8n,1588635312.0,the thought of an accidental tom and katie baby makes me ü•¥ i think u r 100% right with those name predictions tho
vanderpumprules,fpi7hom,t1_fphxeys,1588635206.0,hahhahaha!!! for some reason i think she could pull it off
vanderpumprules,fphwddu,t3_gdjtz4,1588629026.0,unfortunately i really think jax and brittany are gonna pop one out soon
vanderpumprules,fphqyu4,t3_gd3mkf,1588626191.0,i know it‚Äôs an unpopular opinion but i love raquel. she used to come into my work all the time and she was literally so sweet and always tipped well.
vanderpumprules,fphqm5v,t1_fpfn87f,1588626007.0,i‚Äôve been rewatching and i‚Äôm noticing that now the boy crazy stalker is the only storyline they give her anymore. in the first 2 seasons she is sooooo different
vanderpumprules,fphqd3j,t3_gd5skw,1588625876.0,wait what does this mean?
vanderpumprules,fphq88n,t1_fphpiw4,1588625808.0,i agree!!! as much as the show is obviously different now bc they have money and don‚Äôt really work at the restaurant i like watching for THEM and their drama not the restaurant....
vanderpumprules,fphq4qq,t1_fpgu5j7,1588625760.0,kim zolciak says she has no plastic surgery?
vanderpumprules,fpf6yxc,t1_fpewa99,1588563283.0,literally. i don‚Äôt understand how they can be together when they disagree on such big things about their future. maybe it‚Äôs both of them thinking the other will just give in?
vanderpumprules,fpf6vof,t1_fpf00f2,1588563220.0,literally soooooo uncomfortable to watch LOL
vanderpumprules,fpe42ln,t1_fpe3oha,1588539933.0,she is my least favorite person that‚Äôs ever been on the show i think üòÜ
realhousewives,fpdyr0y,t1_fpdt6xh,1588536920.0,but like throwing the party when he knew kyle was gonna be gone? more his actions than his partaking behavior haha
vanderpumprules,fpdym7c,t1_fpdy8ma,1588536842.0,"it blows my mind how she was able to attack (for lack of a better word) tom over the vegas girl knowing that she not only slept with her best friends boyfriend, but her BOYFRIENDS BEST FRIEND IN THEIR OWN HOUSE! When she was freaking out when she was at that photo shoot and met the girl tom slept with, before he even knew her, and kept saying ‚Äúon OUR couch on OUR bed‚Äù like um ... didnt u literally sleep with jax on you and toms couch..? she is such a hypocrite with no remorse or sense of responsibility for her actions."
vanderpumprules,fpdy9xt,t1_fpdy1ui,1588536649.0,LITERALLY!!!!!!
vanderpumprules,fpdy5fj,t1_fpdvllh,1588536578.0,"that makes a lot of sense. i haven‚Äôt seen his mom
on the show yet but looking forward to that."
vanderpumprules,fpdxyeb,t3_gcm8tx,1588536467.0,üòÜ
vanderpumprules,fpdscb1,t1_fpdl1vn,1588533246.0,i agreeee!!!! less so in the first few seasons (maybe bc he was younger?) but now i‚Äôm just like eeek
vanderpumprules,fpds9cy,t1_fpdj661,1588533197.0,ariana and toms book had a whole story line on the show tho? and same with witches of weho now. also i feel like they have talked about scheanas podcast before? i didn‚Äôt realize she was still doing it tho
vanderpumprules,fpdrz26,t3_gcw9ee,1588533031.0,also seeing tom and kristen together is almost sad to watch
vanderpumprules,fpdrkcf,t1_fpdg7xg,1588532799.0,completely true but i feel like it has shifted from ‚Äúi‚Äôll be on this reality show and be crazy and get famous‚Äù to now ‚Äúi‚Äôll be on this show for one season and be boring because i don‚Äôt want to ruin my brand so i can get on this show / this fashion line etc.‚Äù so i guess u r right it‚Äôs more about boring than thirsty
realhousewives,fpdmx80,t1_fpdisya,1588530156.0,did u see all the new drama that came out where some podcast girls apparently said that ken is a sugar daddy for countless girls in la / nyc . not sure if i buy it tho i agree with u he seems to literally worship her
realhousewives,fpdmt7e,t1_fpdl632,1588530093.0,i always thought this bc they are one of my favorite couples ever but he was acting weird on the last few episodes ...
BPD,fpdhexk,t3_gcqaad,1588527039.0,yes. like even if i feel someone‚Äôs energy is off i can‚Äôt think about anything else and just start to panic completely
vanderpumprules,fpdfb4g,t1_fpdf4wu,1588525866.0,oh.. my .. god .. i didn‚Äôt know that. my mind is momentarily blown
vanderpumprules,fpdet6e,t1_fpd8bm0,1588525588.0,who is carli?
vanderpumprules,fpdepsp,t3_gcrwkd,1588525535.0,same. i feel like max and dana have the most future on the show as max seems to actually work there (he also reminds me of james) and we know dana‚Äôs history with the show and she also seems the closest with the actual cast. i was so surprised that so many of u like Danika. whenever she is on screen i can focus on nothing besides trying to figure out why her makeup looks off LOL. hate Charlie. i think she‚Äôs too try hard and boring. but i do like how she hates Brett. will be super disappointed if she ever goes back on that tho.
vanderpumprules,fpdd29o,t1_fpd2zhx,1588524603.0,i read it somewhere on this sub !! a couple days ago when the episode of the proposal aired i believe
vanderpumprules,fpbtws2,t1_fpb6cck,1588478616.0,i thought beaus family was really wealthy? and most of them live in italy?
SmolBeanSnark,fpbta7y,t1_fpa7xrg,1588478162.0,is there a sub on here that i can learn about this on?
BPD,fp6k3tq,t3_g9smkr,1588353702.0,i understand. i feel like i read a lot of advice about understanding that my emotions are not permanent / i‚Äôm only feeling this way because it‚Äôs a reaction to something that happened but it just makes me feel hopeless. it makes me feel like i have no true grasp on reality
vanderpumprules,fp02wtx,t1_foyjnc4,1588201478.0,who is ben and ronnie?
SmolBeanSnark,fol6a5l,t1_fnv1wgb,1587855715.0,thank you So So much ü§ç
