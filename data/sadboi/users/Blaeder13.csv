RandomActsOfGaming,fqpm0lb,t3_gjn4b0,1589549476.0,"The person I appreciate mostly in my life is my mother. She just turned 72 last month and fortunately for her she is still strong at her age despite having Stage IV BrCa and taking on morphine and pills etc. She may not be the perfect mother like everyone claims their mother to be, but she is very kind and generous to us her children, specially to me who relatives/ people considered the blacksheep of the family. Her love for me is unconditional, sometimes to the point that other people (my ex) hate her for it. When I was younger I have this hobby of leaving our home without telling anyone where I'm going to go or what my plans are,  I won't message any of them of my whereabouts. I just turn off my phone, I don't want to hear any of them, that is how selfish I am before. I leave for a month the back home again, I did that on and off for ten f\* years, imagine that. But my mom, she's always there when I get home. She is there smiling, excited to see me, asking where I've been (even though she knows I'm not gonna tell her) and she'll always ask if I've eat enough food or if I'm hungry then she'll cook my favorite food. That is how she treats me my whole life, she do that in front of my siblings that's is why they are angry and jealous with me at that time.

But I'm not perfect, I didn't treat her the way she treats me. I often disobeys her, and gives here headache every F\* time. But at the end of the day, she is always there for me, no matter what. I had a history with substance abuse a decade ago but she's there to guide me. When my son died (the beginning of my depression) she is there for me and my ex despite me ignoring her always. She always makes sure that we are always guided in whatever situation we are in. I may not find another woman in my life like my mom, I love her so much but I'm not the showy type. I know, that's too bad. But I love her, I really do. I wish she lives longer than anticipated but I don't want her to feel the pain, she don't deserve it. Oh if only I can replace myself and have cancer instead of her I would do it, that would be the most unselfish act I will ever do if that is possible. Oh well, I hope somebody reads this because my grammar is bad, I'm sorry. 

Anyway, I'm still looking forward to living a normal life with my mother after this pandemic. I also want to have a job (again) that my mother would be proud of me. I wish I can pamper her but I can't at the moment because of my wrong decisions in life, I screwed up bit time. Still, I believe that day will come. I love you ma! <3

Command & Conquer/ Starcraft and Warcraft are the main three games that started my rts addiction, I love the idea of small armies/ skirmishes happening in real time much like how I imagine it when I was a very young boy. Then there are the macro/ micromanagement aspect that you have to learn to improve your winnings. Final Fantasy Tactics/ XCOM however are the reason why I love tbs games. The idea of customizing my army prior to battles and specifically picking armors and weapons and runes, etc. are very exciting for me that sometimes it even took me hours just deciding what to buy or equip before the actual battle. I just want to share that when my hands or wrist are kind of tired or stressed by playing rts games I switch to tbs games to kind of relax my hands, and it works most of the time for me.
