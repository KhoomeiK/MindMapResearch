If you have fungal folliculitis, definitely shower immediately after working out or getting sweaty as not doing so makes the pustules worse and causes new ones to form."

The treatment for fungal acne that I was initially given, ketoconazole shampoo, worked well enough that it kind of proved that my infection was fungal; plus antibiotics would make the infection worse after cessation of the medication, and sweating made it worse as well.

I use ketoconazole shampoo twice a week and a zinc soap (Happy Cappy medicated shampoo — available on Amazon) that I’ll mix with Hibiclens (chlorhexidine) and leave on each day in the shower for a few minutes. After my shower I use Azelex prescription cream (azelaic acid 20% — it’s available OTC in lower strength) on my face and neck, and CeraVe salicylic acid cream on my chest and abdomen. This regimen has helped to clear a lot of the bumps. I’ll also use a sulfur mask once a week if the sores get bad enough. 

The Hibiclens has worked amazingly well for both of my folliculitis issues. It’s basically the main component of how I treat the bacterial folliculitis on my scalp now, and has worked great so far, along with also helping my fungal breakouts. It sucks that there’s a shortage due to the pandemic, but I hope that soon you’ll be able to fill your prescription for it. It’s available over the counter here in the US (can buy on Amazon when/if it’s available), so that’s an option too if you’re in the states. 

I’ve found that the best way to treat folliculitis is maintenance. Find a routine that works and stick to it. It won’t cure you necessarily, but it can help you manage it. It’s frustrating for sure, but it seems to be the only way.

Rebound anxiety and insomnia are intense and difficult to remedy without a convenient pill, but your brain should equalize itself in time. If not, there’s better non-addictive sleep remedies like Elavil and Doxepin (tricyclics) that help push you over into sleep and keep you there, without the gnarly dependency that comes along with z-drugs and benzodiazepines. 

You know how it goes with benzos: after a few weeks or maybe a month or two of steady nighttime dosing, you need more and more to help get you into the land of [non-opiate related] nod. If anything, I’d use benzos intermittently, and sparingly, like extremely PRN on your worst nights of insomnia, not nightly. There are better drugs for sleep, even if they don’t pack as much of a punch as benzos/z-drugs.

I was all kindsa mad. The pharmacist said it was only listed as a moderate interaction, but what I was feeling was anything other than moderate. I had been on it for over a week, I had no color in my face, my lips were a putrid shade of light purple, and I had lost 12 pounds, so I stopped taking it.

Having my diagnosis, and getting the appropriate treatment (therapy & meds), helped to set me up for success in a way I didn’t have before.

Try to get as much as you can out of your treatment, and don’t fight it every inch of the way — I’m sure there’s something positive to be garnered there. It’s also important to remember that while diagnoses are important, they’re not the end-all-be-all of who you are as a person — they’re just a collection of symptoms organized into a convenient label.

As for it’s use in ‘Murica, the puritanical ‘morals’ which undergird much of our society, probably won’t let it happen, even though it would be hella beneficial. People here lose their collective shit over methadone clinics and safe injecting sites as it is."
OpiatesRecovery,fnnrjem,t1_fnnpgft,1587099644.0,"I think it’s more about harm reduction than anything. Providing daily pharmaceutical-grade opiates, without the adulterants and guesstimate dosing that are a hazard of illicit street opiates, decreases overdoses and can help give people at least a small measure of stability as they aren’t having to hustle to get money for their habit everyday like they would without a program like this. I agree with you that it seems to involve a degree of enabling, but you know how it goes if you’re on this sub: people don’t get clean — real, lasting sobriety clean — until they absolutely want to; and if a program like this can keep people from overdosing and dying, and possibly help them get their lives together a bit while hopefully getting to the point where they want to quit for good, I can support that."
OpiatesRecovery,fnnnxh3,t3_g2syrn,1587096934.0,"The way I was being tapered was a 10mg decrease *a month* after being titrated off OxyContin. A quick taper would be to lower your use by 10mg a week, or to be more conservative and thus more friendly to your brain, 5mg a week. This all depends on how long you’ve been using and how dependent you are. 

Tapering is tough, especially when you’re in pain, and even more so when chemically dependent, but it can be done. It’s really important to consider your pain, as that’ll play a large part in your success with a taper schedule. 

As for lowering tolerance, the only way I know of doing that is getting used to a lower dose (usually much lower), if not total abstinence (go through withdrawal and wait for your tolerance to essentially reset, but I don’t recommend this as it can lead to OD). 

If you can get your prescribing doctor to set up a taper and monitor you, that would be ideal."

OpiatesRecovery,fngq56i,t3_g1mk1m,1586940830.0,"My advice to you right now would be to focus on quitting one substance at a time. Ideally opiates first — deal with that as it’ll be the most difficult, while allowing yourself the ability to vape (nicotine can help during withdrawal and the first stages of being clean as it’s an anxiolytic and will help with anxiety), and later focus on quitting nicotine. Overwhelming yourself by trying to quit all the substances you’re dependent on at once will have a higher propensity for relapse. 

Rehab would be a good idea if you can get into one. 

You can get through this. I know it’s frightening but this will allow you to focus on the underlying issues which caused you to self-medicate in the first place. You’ve already made progress by recognizing that you have a problem and wanting to quit — that’s a huge step."

The meeting itself was generally okay, except for this one lady who wouldn’t stop talking about car trouble after the person leading the meeting said it was time to let someone else speak, like 45 minutes of full on semi-manic ranting — damn Cecilia, chill. Afterwards, despite saying I was there to support a friend, I got hit on by another female while smoking a cigarette. I don’t care who or what you’re into, but besides being straight, I wasn’t there looking for a date. Feck.

I’m not a fan of antidepressants as they always induce hypomanic episodes in me, but I know for some they’re helpful. The value of antidepressants in the treatment of bipolar disorder is questionable, and I think mood stabilizers are more important, but I’d honestly talk to your doctor about it to be safe."

Bipolar is a chronic condition, and meds are unfortunately a vital part of managing this illness for most. Also, please don’t stop your meds without speaking to your doctor — some have nasty withdrawal symptoms, and can even be dangerous to stop suddenly."
bipolar,fn8ys8a,t3_g09wkg,1586753999.0,"I was diagnosed with a handful of BPD traits when I was 19/20. I didn’t show enough traits for the full disorder, but it’s relatable nonetheless. My BPD traits went into remission in my late twenties after extensive therapy, then I had a traumatic experience at age 33, and suddenly I showed symptoms of bipolar disorder (first hypomanic episode, when before I had only experienced major depression, diagnosed with MDD). I was finally diagnosed with bipolar type 2 at age 35 by my family doctor; but the psychiatrist who had diagnosed me with BPD traits was adamant that I didn’t have bipolar, because he thought it was simply BPD traits compounded by pre-existing PTSD, and he had been treating me for ~15 years at that point, so this fucked with me in trying to decide what to do. It was clear, however, as time went on, that I most definitely experienced hypomania from time to time and fit the criteria for BP2. It’s been difficult to differentiate between my BPD and bipolar 2 diagnoses when looking at my mood swings and behaviors, but therapy has helped a lot in this regard.

ETA: I feel like I fit more with BP2 now, and it’s possible I aged out of the handful of BPD traits I had according to my current psychologist. Super confusing. Idk."

Life is hectic and chaotic, and people are complicated, so the odds of their lack of reply being personal is slim to none, and 2. If the reason they’re not replying *is* personal, there’s quite literally nothing I can do about that, thus it’s somewhat pointless to care. Also, if they want to leave me on read/ghost me because of this mysterious reason instead of speaking to me about it, they’re not worth my time or energy. That may sound cold but having the capacity to care is contingent upon the respect shown to me, and being ignored long enough is tacitly disrespectful. However, 9/10, they don’t reply because they’re busy, dealing with their own shit, forgetfulness, and the like."

PsychMelee,fn6jxp7,t3_fzw68d,1586701170.0,"While I agree with many of the points made in the article, the term or idea of medical nihilism gives me pause. Nihilism has played a part in our postmodernist world, but the extreme skepticism inherent in its application is worrisome. 

> French philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard characterizes postmodernism as an “incredulity toward metanarratives,” those all-embracing foundations that we have relied on to make sense of the world. This extreme skepticism has undermined intellectual and moral hierarchies and made “truth” claims, transcendental or transcultural, problematic. Postmodern antifoundationalists, paradoxically grounded in relativism, dismiss knowledge as relational and “truth” as transitory, genuine only until something more palatable replaces it (reminiscent of William James’ notion of “cash value”). The critic Jacques Derrida, for example, asserts that one can never be sure that what one knows corresponds with what is. Since human beings participate in only an infinitesimal part of the whole, they are unable to grasp anything with certainty, and absolutes are merely “fictional forms.”

[Source. ](https://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/) 

This tends to undermine empiricism and rationalism, and naturally negates the possibility of anything we know being a sufficient form of proof as everything is questioned to the extreme, i.e. nothing can be trusted. While questioning what we know is important to learning and experience, of course, there’s a line drawn whereby too much of this approach can lead to an unmooring of any form of truth, as in nothing can be known and nothing can be true. This presents numerous problems. 

Given that the article is about a philosopher and at least one of his works, I thought I’d critique it from that perspective as I do agree with some of its points that over medication and the invention of certain disorders is a problem."

bipolar,fn5mcpl,t3_fzoxcd,1586668853.0,"I’ve run into this situation numerous times over the years. My former psychiatrist, who also did therapy, explained to me that sometimes it’s enough to simply enjoy the luxury of therapy. Having an objective observer to bounce ideas off of, discuss topics you’re interested in, and generally just to engage with, is beneficial in its own right. Engaging with your therapist like this can also lead to new ideas and epiphanies about yourself that end up being really helpful. 

I find that keeping up with therapy, even when I don’t have much to say about myself, and not much to work on, is good as it maintains a healthy habit."

I see her as a deeply wounded and troubled individual who doesn’t have the social skills necessary to know how her actions affect others and ultimately to behave decently — or she’s Machiavellian enough to simply not care that she’s causing the people in her life pain. She’s so overwhelmed by her own pain and shortcomings that the slights delivered to others, especially Lenú, don’t seem to matter to her. While her mental instability doesn’t excuse her actions whatsoever, I still have empathy for her. I imagine (and hope) that later in life she’ll regret her actions towards Lenú — but as of now she’s on a malicious trajectory that only seems to reinforce the pain and inferiority she feels. I haven’t read the books, but I imagine this behavior and penchant for cruelty *could* lead to decades of torment for her. So while her behavior is indeed intolerable, I feel more empathy and pity than revulsion.

OpiatesRecovery,fn2dqx2,t3_fyfmzg,1586585498.0,"It’s the addict’s paradox — the euphoria and hedonistic joys of being high versus the healthy, stable, and socially acceptable benefits of being clean. We embody both premises, or ideas, yet they contradict one another as we can’t have both simultaneously and they’re opposing states of being. I feel like a lot of relapses come from this eternal struggle — the memories of that dopamine hit, juxtaposed against the seemingly less pleasurable experience of sobriety and stability. We miss that rush of a dopamine agonist hitting our opiate receptors, while knowing that it’s a far from sustainable state, and it’s incomparable to the other life we build while sober. How do you reconcile this contradiction? I think that, ultimately, you can’t — we can’t. It’s not meant to be reconciled so much as it’s supposed to exist as a lesson for moving forward. Time and continued work on sobriety is really the only remedy for this quandary. Also, it’s important to remember that looking at the past — getting high —through the lens of nostalgia tends to eliminate many of the negative facets of that act, while creating the illusion that it’s more positive and desirable than it actually is."

Hopefully this will pass — but please pay attention to your body and don’t be afraid to seek medical attention if you don’t improve.

BPD,fn27sre,t3_fymsl1,1586580258.0,"It sounds like you’re experiencing mood lability with the possibility of hypomania (mania lite, essentially). For an episode to be classified as hypomania or mania, it needs to last for at least a week, although some will last only a few days, which is why I suggest this as more mood lability than hypomania. Some with bipolar experience Ultradian cycling (ultra ultra rapid cycling) where they’re hypomanic/manic and depressed throughout the day, but this is a questionable classification of episodic frequency — this, however, can resemble the normal mood swings/mood lability seen in BPD. By definition, one manic or hypomanic episode will cause you to meet the main diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder. Bipolar is a common comorbidity of BPD — I have bipolar type 2 and a handful of BPD traits.

bipolar2,fmvnxlp,t1_fmvmv3n,1586424067.0,"It’s awesome that you already have some lifestyle changes and methods to help you cope with this — you’re definitely ahead of the curve there. Those kinds of things (exercise, light therapy, a good diet, structure and routine, therapy, etc) are very beneficial for bipolar folks, and can be difficult to implement. I’m glad that your inner referee is more vocal now that you’re on meds, even if it’s a placebo effect. Depending on what meds you’re on, it’s definitely possible that they’re beginning to benefit you already. 

My “watch yourself” voice was something I invented when I was 19 because I was aware of how easily I’d get out of control, but I wasn’t diagnosed bipolar until I was 35. Back then I had PTSD, MDD, and a few traits of BPD. I spent my twenties trying very hard to kill myself, and had my last attempt and psych ward admission in 2009. Through intensive therapy, and simply maturing, along with meds and finally receiving the proper diagnoses, I slowly perfected the use of that voice. To answer your question, I find that meds are crucial as instability and chaos are far too familiar to me because of a traumatic childhood, and I easily fall back into destructive ways, so they do indeed enable me to better command my thoughts, personality, mood, and ultimately my actions. But, to put a finer point on it: after a tumultuous and difficult 6 years after the loss of my dad to suicide in 2014, including my bipolar diagnosis a year after his death, it’s decidedly the combination of meds, therapy, and my own iron will to not hurt myself and demand stability that has made this journey easiest. So meds absolutely factor into this equation 100% — without them I more than likely would not be here. (Sorry if this came off as overly dramatic.)"
bipolar2,fmvm392,t1_fmvl81b,1586421993.0,"My doctor would’ve been better off just prescribing me crack considering how I responded to Prozac (lol it was terrible). Hardcore relate to your experience because I always enter mixed episodes when coming off SSRIs. 

Mood tracking helps on a larger scale to see how your moods look as a whole over time. Say over a month, you can see how you’ve cycled; or, over the course of a few months, you can get a grasp of how long your episodes are and if you’ve been relatively stable in that time. This helps to see how you’ve responded to meds, to stress in your life, and various different things, and helps to see what triggers you while also giving you the ability to better predict how you’ll do in the future so that you can kind of plan for your episodes. It’s not perfect by any means but it’s helpful because humans suck at remembering things of this nature accurately over any significant span of time. 

Yeah, it’s a lot of uncertainty. I have a bunch of checks and balances in my repertoire to make sure that I don’t transgress the boundaries of hypomania and depression and do something dangerous or destructive. I’m a tad neurotic with it but it’s served me well. Through therapy and experience, it definitely gets easier. I have this phrase I recite (kinda lame): watch yourself, and this helps me to just always be aware of what I’m feeling and how I’m acting, to keep myself in check and maintain my equilibrium. It’s a delicate balance but definitely doable.

It’s tough at first to know what’s normal, what’s ideal, and what’s not. As time goes by and you try out meds, you’ll slowly reach a stasis where delineating between hypomania and depression, and also stability, becomes easier. It’ll always be a bit of a struggle, but it’s not an impossible feat by any means. Mood tracking helps a lot in identifying how you’re feeling over time  — I use the Daylio app."

I ask because I take a medication called Prazosin for PTSD related nightmares, anxiety and flashbacks, and it’s helped to get those symptoms under control recently. Sometimes getting our symptoms ironed out with meds can help to clear things up enough to do other necessary work, like finding a therapist. I’m also bipolar, so I jumped right to this as a suggestion because medication is an essential part of the equation for coping with that disorder. 

I’m sorry I couldn’t be of more help. If things get bad enough, please go to the ER — I know that’s a sketchy idea now but I don’t want anything to happen to you.
