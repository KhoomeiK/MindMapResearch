disneymagickingdoms,fr6gzrq,t3_gmpjd8,1589926081.0,"I started a few days into the Star Wars event and fell in love with the game within a few hours of first opening it. I decided I needed to have all of the Star Wars collection so spent around £25 on bundles and gems in order to help me unlock California Screaming and start the event. I haven’t spent much money since though as I realised I went a bit crazy for that collection. 

I think it’s a lot more daunting for new players as it can take a long time to catch up. I’ve just unlocked the Bambi storyline now and I’m finding it a bit hectic with all the quests I have open. I’m guessing that Bambi/Zootopia/DuckTales came later so maybe they didn’t realise that some people would have to do them all at once as well as all the side quests and main storyline + whatever event is happening. I’m still enjoying it though and I’m catching up quite quickly as I’m a really active player. Unlocking all the parade slots is really helping with my gem inflow so I can afford to splurge on legendary chests and things to help build my collection."

Also some people say that the pill makes you gain weight and that’s what makes your boobs grow. This is not necessarily true. The pill does not force you to gain weight but it can change your appetite which can make you eat more and then gain weight.

Stay strong OP. My mum gave me one good bit of advice after it all happened and that was to always make sure you are financially independent of your husband so if you’re strong enough to leave, you can. Too many women stick with shitty husbands at that age because they can’t afford to leave and would struggle to find another partner to help support them.

I would suggest talking to your dad but it really depends on what sort of person he is and you know your family better than the internet does.

Doctors used to think PCOS made you infertile but as more research is done into it, they’re realising it doesn’t. Please talk to a different doctor.

disneymagickingdoms,fce2w9x,t3_eh06dk,1577616421.0,I had that too then out of nowhere yesterday I got one of poe’s helmets. Might’ve been a bug.
reylo,fc85n53,t1_fc71y21,1577527403.0,Yeah I don’t know if it’ll be shown in 2022 because they’ve also leaked another trilogy based on the old republic so we might get that one first then they’ll finish the Reylo story a few years later. Or maybe they’ll have the Rian trilogy in the years between like Rogue one and Solo were. Idk if they’d want to show them both at the same time.
reylo,fc6r0xy,t1_fc6o6x4,1577487283.0,"Driver said in an interview that he has no plans to go back to Star Wars right now but this seems more of a ‘my character is dead and they haven’t asked me yet’ rather than ‘I wouldn’t go back even if they offered me a billion dollars’. From his other interviews he seems really invested in Ben Solo as a character so I feel like he’d definitely be interested in a chance to fix JJ’s mess.

Daisy Ridley said she’d definitely go back to Star Wars as long as Oscar and John were there too and I’m sure Disney could squeeze them in. 

Some information about a possible future trilogy directed by Rian Johnson has been leaked and it has the working title of ‘Offspring of the Jedi’ and it’s set after episode 9. As far as I can tell, Rey is the last Jedi and since Ben is the only one she kissed... You get the idea lol

Besides, I feel that given enough money any of the actors would come back. Heck Harrison Ford did NOT want to come back AT ALL but Disney managed to bribe him. I feel like the actors deciding not to come back is the least of our worries right now."

When I was younger my parents insisted on bringing me to funerals even though I knew I physically couldn’t handle it. I ended up having laughing fits (my reaction to sensory overload) due to the amount of people and music. A lot of family members saw me as disrespectful and I wish I wasn’t forced to go."

reylo,fboe5cs,t3_ee3deo,1577009618.0,"I hope this is true!! I’m feeling right now, as strongly as I thought Reylo would become canon in TFA, that Ben Solo will return. No one is ever truly gone."
reylo,fbocrt1,t1_fbmqkey,1577009248.0,I think they left that deliberately open. I feel like they might bring him back someday... hopefully!

AskReddit,fajtpen,t3_e9eoe2,1576154358.0,"I called a taxi at around 8pm to go to a nightclub. A car pulls up and the Uber app says my ride is here so my friend and I jump in. The guy turns around and says ‘are you girls alright?’ We smile politely and say ‘yes thank you.’ He then switches the car light on and says ‘I’m not a taxi.’

Easily the most awkward moment of my life. Turns out he lives down the street from me and was just coming home late from work. I see his car sometimes parked and it makes me cringe every time."
relationships,fah35fy,t1_fah29ko,1576078084.0,"As I said in my original post, if OP doesn't like it then he needs to tell her to stop. She then needs to apologise and if she continues after he's asked her then there's a big problem.

In my honest opinion, I wouldn't consider this cheating and I know a few people who would agree. It's still kind of shady that she didn't mention it to him but I, personally, would give her the benefit of the doubt. OP and his fiancee have been together for almost 4 years. It's not worth breaking up over something that she may not have even realised upset him."
AmItheButtface,fagl9p1,t3_e94orb,1576061181.0,"leaning slightly towards YBF. This is just picky. I see nothing wrong with her asking you to bring his swimsuit. Would you get angry if he was invited to a swimming birthday party and the person organising it asked you to bring his swim suit?

Tbh the cough is fine too. She was just advising you to take him to the doctors.

Asking someone to change their wording is just picky imo. It means the same thing you’re just being fussy. It sounds like you perhaps don’t like how much she’s getting involved. Why don’t you ask her to take a step back and leave you to it for a while?"

relationships,faghn2b,t1_fag0av4,1576055386.0,Not always... everyone is different :0 Some people only consider it cheating if it’s in real life. VR is a big gray area.
