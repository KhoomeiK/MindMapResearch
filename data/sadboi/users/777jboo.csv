BernieSanders,fhk2r3j,t3_f2re17,1581664283.0,"show them (or let them hear/see him talking on youtube from his past views) Bloombergs own words/policies from the past! thats what works best because after researching him all week and more info coming out about his racist comments (“throwing minorities against walls to illegally search them” stop & frisk, wanting to fingerprint people with public housing to “prove” they live there, calling *medical* cannabis “the greatest hoax”, and so much other insanity) has frightened me to the point of not knowing if hes worse than Trump or not. i will vote blue no matter who except Bloomberg. still not voting Trump. also my children are minorities and Bloomberg gave me anxiety attacks this week. The media is in his favor, the establishment is corrupt. i’m just so depressed. sorry for the rant."
Anxiety,fhk05mq,t3_f3kd94,1581661353.0,have you tried playing music that you enjoy or soothing music to overcome this? or earplugs when needed. music always helps me
Anxiety,fhjzw5p,t3_f3m6p5,1581661070.0,"the news has caused massive anxiety attacks this week. tomorrow im staying off it completely. politics. corruption. medical scares. our planet. evil humans every where.

googlefiber,fhifgrc,t3_f2zul4,1581623714.0,trying to determine if it is just our ps4 having this problem since when we watch netflix/youtube tv thru the smart tv wifi it doesnt have any connection issues. any recommendations for ps4 connecting to google wifi mesh?? think we need an additional router?

Christianity,fab5t03,t3_e80l5f,1575918181.0,"I live with my partner whom I consider myself married to but its not on paper and no ceremony was done at a church. We have been together for 10 years, prayed to God about our relationship and our parents have been aware of this for many years. If someone told me I was sinning I would not agree. Plus in my state we are considered common law married. So my point is that sometimes we may not be able to tell another person they are sinner because 1) that may not change their mind and 2) you may not be correct about it. God knows my heart and blessed me with my soulmate and I’m sure God would be very accepting of my informal marriage."
Christianity,f9l9f9p,t3_e5lmlm,1575417598.0,so thankful to God for blessing me with an opportunity at my “dream employer” on my birthday a few months ago. i still cant believe this is real after applying for so long. love you God
Christianity,f9i37fu,t1_f9i2s3p,1575327189.0,thank you
Christianity,f9hif91,t1_f9hg5rn,1575315685.0,yesss so true i have thought of all these things that i hope to overcome soon! and move on to the next anxiety haha i just need to take the first step of publishing what i have. i will definitely think of the positive aspects. thank you so much
Christianity,f9hf5rr,t1_f9gzrp2,1575314118.0,thank you so much for sharing your perspective having been through it personally! I can’t wait (any longer) for the day I can finally say I tried! I just can’t live with this on my mind anymore... I have to try and I will. I will look at the article you shared right now. appreciate the motivational words!
Christianity,f9gxi67,t1_f9gx2qi,1575306160.0,yes you are right. i will probably have to start off with not reading comments until i get more comfortable! Or else I will think about it nonstop for days due to my anxiety. thanks for the advice!
Christian,f94f4xx,t3_e3nj0h,1575086288.0,"I also suffer from severe anxiety however I am a woman so can’t relate to that aspect. I’m sorry you feel so alone but so glad you have the world/internet to vent to! I have am prescribed anxiety medicine which makes me sleepy but I use it when needed and have done therapy but here in the USA its the same story $120+ visits for all (unless you have great health insurance). After many years of suffering with anxiety I have learned that when my mind won’t stop thinking horrible things its best to nap and it resets my brain! I hope you can find a good way to get some sleep. 

I have (secretly) self medicated with cannabis for the last 19 years.. I’m not sure if you are open to this but it could help. I simply recommend trying different strains until you find one that is relaxing because some can cause anxiety to increase."
Christianity,f949nkn,t3_e3oxxd,1575081497.0,"No more sadness, pain and all the negative feelings and experiences. The Bible says we will forget all about this current world but that truly makes me sad that I could forget about all the people I love. I do wish I could “fly” through outer space and see all the beauty God created somehow."
Christianity,f948vqt,t3_e3p6bp,1575080842.0,Prayers for a successful fast! The first week is the hardest and then you get used to social media not being a routine part of the day. I always liked social media for keeping track of my thoughts and experiences so if you do too I would recommend journaling.
