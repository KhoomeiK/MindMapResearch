EDAnonymous,fr5rub6,t3_gmt16f,1589913602.0,"Haven’t experience in this, and please correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe it’s more to do with the lack of nutrients rather than your weight. If you start out obese and restrict to the point of limited nutrients, you could still start getting cold, having dry skin and having your hair fall out while still obese. Even at a healthy weight you can lose hair if you lack the needed nutrients. As for how long it would take, I think it’s different for everyone, particularly based on what foods you’re eating and how much you restrict. Someone who eats only chocolate and ice cream while restricting will lack more nutrients than say, someone who only eats fruit, veg and lean meat."
EDAnonymous,fr5rh15,t3_gmt1ke,1589913423.0,"Ignore the other comment, that was totally unneeded. I once stayed the same exact weight for 10 days in a row, despite being well into a deficit too. Sometimes when losing weight people plateau (even when losing weight healthily) and while it is frustrating, you will lose weight eventually. That’s the so called whooosh - where you seem to maintain or even gain despite eating at a deficit and all of a sudden you drop a ridiculous amount of weight in a couple of days. Sometimes if it goes on for a long time (more than a few weeks) you can try eating maintenance for a while. While you haven’t gone into starvation mode per day, it can shake up your metabolism a little bit since there are effects on it when you restrict consistently for long periods of time"

Of course it’s not easy, and something I still struggle with, hence why I’m getting help, but I find my biggest problems weren’t really problems in themselves, it was more the way I was reacting or responding to them. Changing the way I naturally respond to a situation is my goal. If I’m late to class, I want to change my response. In the past it’s ruin my week, and likely cause a panic attack.

You say you don’t belittle the younger ones, so don’t start now. A big change can be different for everyone. I wouldn’t call moving across country a small change. 

My life has far been from exciting either. Ups aren’t necessarily good. They may be better but not perfect. And even my ups don’t add excitement. As I started saying, a change like that wouldn’t mean anything for you with your mental state. You’re unhappy. You’ll still be unhappy as the other gender. And it won’t bring excitement or anything, it’ll still feel the same deep down. The problem is with your mental health, not (only) the surroundings. 

I’m sorry that therapy isn’t available, but going without therapy isn’t the hard way. Therapy isn’t an easy way out for many, and for some, it’s the only way out. You may just have to accept that without external help, things may not improve. If I left myself to get on with things currently, without any help, then I know things wouldn’t improve."

I’m more confident in my abilities and more determined that they’re real. I hope growing up the way I have will benefit my adult mind, and I certainly hold to the idea of never doubting a child due to their age. 

I think all big changes are enacted by small one, or least, that they all start small in one way or another. Even if it’s simple reflection and a decision on what to change. Perhaps big changes are what you need, but I’d struggle to dictate, given it’s what you feel like needs to change"
mentalhealth,fqv3esq,t1_fqugoza,1589669081.0,"Thank you, for changing your attitude. You’re not as dismissive as you first appear, and I think you could benefit much from someone challenging you and giving you back and forth. I don’t think you’re as difficult to open up as you claim to be, perhaps someone just has to hit the right chords. And yeah, at 18 I’m thankfully getting less of the more dismissive comments regarding my age, however I’ve still had some take me less seriously for such, so thank you for that. And of course I understand that emptiness. Perhaps not in the same way as you, but I’ve not had any specific trauma I survived. I’ve just lost a few years of my life to nothing. Loneliness and bad memories make up much of my childhood, but nothing important enough to say I’ve survived or overcome it. 

I agree that it may be the wrong approach to change things completely. I don’t think it general lot works, since you’re still the same person. You have the same thought process and memories, and if you’re still depressed, you’ll be depressed in a different city or with a different job. Of course, there may factors which you could change which ease it. If your job plays a significant role in your depression, then there’s no harm in changing it. But for some, depression isn’t routed in anything specific. For me, I get depressed no matter my situation. A big change in this manor may not only be too difficult, but also ultimately worthless. Small changes make a difference. Something as small as cleaning your room, making yourself a decent meal. Getting a shower and shave. Answering that email. All small but positive steps. Any progress is still progress, and change doesn’t have to be sudden or dramatic."
mentalhealth,fqty2kr,t1_fqtwa7i,1589648320.0,"While you need to open up for therapy to work, it’s not uncommon for some people to struggle to do so. Maybe if you can find a more understanding therapist who is willing to work in the long run, you may have more success. It seems like there are things you can be open on even to someone like me, so I don’t think it would take long to build a good relationship and open up to a therapist if you found the right one, with the right method. 

And truthfully, I can’t speak for age. I’m much younger than you’d probably guess, so I’d feel improper intruding on things I have no knowledge on. Only that I wouldn’t dictate a certain age to a certain feeling. I was told that childhood was supposed to be the best time of my life, but so far it turned out to be the worst. Like many things, it’s different for everyone, so there’s no point in thinking that things should go like this, or will go like that. 

I think it’s hard to see your own change, especially when it’s overtime. Like I said before, there is no end. I was having a casual conversation one day and I said that I didn’t want to die. It hit me that I meant it. I couldn’t remember when I started meaning it. I didn’t wake up one day and had a sudden epiphany. I didn’t realise when I’d stopped having suicidal ideation. Only that I didn’t anymore. It’s like weight loss. You lose a pound each week. You don’t see it, and you don’t notice it. You keep doing it and sometimes you sit there thinking that you’re so fat and nothing you’re doing is working, and then suddenly you realise the next day that your jeans are too big. When did that happen? Did I really change that much? I don’t see it at all, so how could I have changed like that? Even when others notice and tell you, you struggle to see it yourself. The metaphor might be a little longwinded, but it’s a similar thought process. We, as humans, struggle to see the importance of small changes overtime, to the point where we sometimes even struggle to notice the change at all. I think it’s important to try and find very small changes that you don’t even realise. Sometimes you might not even remember what changed. But if you’ve been working on things for that long, I’d imagine there’s change even if you don’t notice."
mentalhealth,fqtnucp,t1_fqth51b,1589642613.0,"I think you need change. I think self destruction or changing gender or anything like that is going about it the wrong way. And truthfully, those changes will get boring after a while. For me the bored, numb nature of depression was worse than the sadness and despair ever was. You need to crack your depression, because there are interesting things all around which depression numbs you to. I thought I needed a whole new fresh start, to change myself entirely. But after getting rid of that permanent numbness and boredom, often you don’t need to be someone and somewhere else (though of course this is still an option). 

And I understand about the people. It’s natural to assume it if it’s all you’ve experienced. Just be aware that it’s not all there is entirely. And all of your relationships in life aren’t destined to be the same way. 

From what you’ve said about therapy, either you’re not being honest or you’re seeing some poor therapists. Therapy should offer you a place to open up and ask questions. To throw around ideas and to look at why you’re feeling a certain way. Different therapists work differently, perhaps there is a specific type of therapy that may work better. That, or perhaps you need to cycle through more therapists. It’s not uncommon to have to, and no good therapist should shame you for wanting to switch therapist. Some people just don’t get on.

What you did, here just now, that’s what you need to do. That’s opening up. Not shooting ideas down but discussing them. Maybe you’ll end up seeing something from a different light, or realising something you hadn’t. I take back what I said. I think you want to change, I just think you don’t know how."

mentalhealth,fqtg1fa,t1_fqtajl6,1589638271.0,"I don’t plan on continuing this conversation. You have no right to act like being a woman is better than being a man, and I have seen men challenging these roles with my own eyes. The prominence of the LGBT scene, drag queens, the entire movement of encouragement of men showing emotions, the ever-increasing show of the struggles that men face regarding sexual harassment and stereotypes. The fact that it’s becoming more and more accepted for men to be single fathers, or to cry at a film, or to dress with more feminine attire (eg, it’s now not unseen to see women wear makeup, crop tops, paint their nails, or have long hair). It’s no where near what it should be but expectations will always be challenged, whenever or where ever you are. Hell, you still got people being openly gay when it was punishable by death. You still got women wearing trousers in the 19th century. Things will always be challenged. If you claim that I don’t know the struggles of men because I am not one, that is true. I don’t know the full struggle and I don’t claim too. Yet in your previous posts and comments you’ve claimed to know the struggle of groups of people you don’t fit in to. Being an introvert doesn’t mean you’re okay with being alone. Being a woman isn’t automatically easier than being a man. By saying such, you’re implying that I can’t feel distraught about things because being a woman is so much easier. I don’t need a support system or friends because I’m an introvert. Both untrue. Also, look at the definition of an introvert. It doesn’t mean being alone all the time. It means valuing alone time. Not liking being alone is human, and society these days isn’t built for introverts if you want to get anywhere in it. Don’t fucking claim to know that because you haven’t experience that.

I also don’t appreciate the sentiment that I would judge you more than other guys based on these. Yes, women are often harsh on man unfairly. Do not imply that it is every woman and that no woman would support you. You have a problem with assuming that those around you dictate the thought process of everyone else. You saw one person who didn’t help, therefore no one can. Everyone in your life left you, therefore no one will ever want you. That’s not how life works. Furthermore, switching genders just because you think life would be easier as a woman is an insult to both woman, and the trans community. 

Those ideas about being harsh are either false ideas in your mind, or the fault of a poor environment. It looks like you don’t want to do anything to change either of them. 

Looking at your post history and previous conversations, I don’t intend to give you anymore attention. You say stereotypical and insulting things about others because you place your problems above theirs, and make claims about the struggles of people you have no way of knowing about (You are not a woman. You are not an introvert. You cannot claim to know the struggles of either and by doing so you diminish their problems). You are also extremely agressive and argumentative, only looking for sympathy and shooting down any advice or attention people give you. I firmly believe that you aren’t getting better because you don’t realise how poor some of your actions have been. Perhaps this agression and lack of respect for others hasn’t done your relationships any good. But tell me, what have you received out of our conversation? Because I’ve tried offering hope, understanding, and advice and each one you have rejected. I’ve taken time out of my day to try and help as much as I can. All you have done is tell me I’m wrong and oblivious to your struggles and that my struggles mean nothing. Being an extrovert or women would be no different. I didn’t get help because I’m a woman. I’m an introvert who isn’t okay alone. You’re putting blame on those things, likely due to your agressive nature. There is hope for you and things can change. But nothing I say will help you, and clearly I just ‘don’t understand your situation’. Nothing I say will make you change. No comment on reddit will change your situation. No post on here either. You have to want to change. You seem quite comfortable taking your hate, anger, and pain out on others and blaming them at the moment. I hope one day you’ll realise this."

Then I have a week where I’m practically hypomanic (excessive energy, little sleep, overwhelming optimism and plans for the future), and then a week where I’m badly depressed. I’m trying to get support at the minute, so don’t have any diagnosis but I’ve heard it could still be some form of bipolar, given some people don’t even realise they’re hypomanic (and for someone who has been depressed for a long time, some struggle to tell the difference between normal and hypomania). I’d definitely see someone about it, it’s not normal if it comes with such intensity. 

In the mean time, something that has massively helped me is tracking my mood day to day. I use the app Daylio and it can give me a good overall picture, from which I’ve worked out a pretty regular pattern to my mood. It’s something both me and my mental health team find really useful, particularly if trying to explain it for the first time."
mentalhealth,fqt6w1d,t1_fqswtjy,1589631803.0,"It’s hard to say about the expectations, they’re different for everyone. I think many gender roles are bull shit though. There are many expectations as a woman, and I get a fair amount of bull from my family for defying them. Even just not wearing skirts and dresses has some people on my back, and there are many pressure on me to live my life a certain way because I’m female, to which I say fuck off, I’m human. I’ll live my life how best it suits me, regardless of what a female ‘should do’. I think these pressures will change in time; that’s less the fault of the people around you and more the fault of society as a whole, but younger generations are challenging these ideas more and more. I don’t think anyone likes a man just because they exist. I don’t think anyone likes women just because they exist (or perhaps only pervs who view the human body for solely eye candy). Likewise though, I don’t think anyone is instantly disliked for existing. Everyone deserves a baseline level of respect. It can be taken away if they don’t deserve it, but likewise it can be increase if you like the person. You don’t have to have everyone like you. That’s an impossible standard to hold yourself to. You’ll never please everyone, and that’s okay. You just have to choose who you want around you and who you don’t care about pleasing. 

If there are people holding you to a different standard that are putting ridiculous and damaging pressure on you, then perhaps rethink whether you should be sticking by those expectations. At the end of the day everyone is human, it won’t do you harm to take care of yourself once in a while. I built everything I have by being harsh on myself. I kept the majority of it, and traded a small amount for keeping my physical and mental health in good shape (being so harsh left me in a dire mental condition and made my physically ill very frequently. I kept my reputation - I just made sure I wasn’t making myself sick). And while it is hard to have compassion without a supportive environment, it goes back to whether you are willing to break these common expectations. Your health comes first, and it’s suffering currently, hence, you need to prioritise your health"
mentalhealth,fqrr0xf,t1_fqrmwnn,1589590067.0,"I think it depends on what expectations they’re putting on you and why. I can’t tell you one way or another, but look at it objectively. If you say, have a friend who wants you to take a shower, ring a mental he sloth clinic, contact them once in a while, get some help, perhaps wants to encourage you to hit decent grades or keep your attendance at work, then they likely have good intentions. These people likely care for you, and although it may seem forceful or pushy or like too much is being placed on you, they often have your best interest at heart. Sometimes there are friends who mean well, but not execute it well. They may think a night out or a friendly conversation will cure your mood, or may not quite understand a self destructive habit and may think you can just stop it easily. They may have good intentions, but you may have to speak with a friend about their expectations or the reality of your situation. That it’s not possible to brush it off, or that when you’re having a bad week, you might still struggle with certain things. Some will understand but others may not. It doesn’t mean they’re bad people you need to cut off, but it may be hard to get support from them because they struggle to understand the situation. Then there are expectations you can’t meet, or you may find extremely strenuous. For me, I was told by my teachers that I should walk out of school with nine A*s. Not impossible, but really fucking difficult. I got two As and wasn’t congratulated because it wasn’t high enough for some of them. Obviously I couldn’t cut my teachers out of my life, but I didn’t hold myself to their expectations because they were so unrealistic. A similar teacher in college saw her criticise me with everything I did - it got to the point where I even had other college staff telling me to ignore her because she was never satisfied. These expectations only did harm, so while I couldn’t avoid them, i tried extremely hard to ignore them and set something more realistic that I could be proud of. A B isn’t my target, nor it even close to what I ‘should have’ gotten, but I struggled with the class, the teacher, and my mental health and knew that a B was still objectively a great grade and more realistic. I accepted I was never going to get an A* (and if I did, it would have killed me from what I was putting myself through). I also had friends who thought that I could just snap out of my depression and wouldn’t accept or understand that I couldn’t. It became problematic when we tried to hang out but they disliked my low mood and told me I was dragging them down. That I shouldn’t bring it up around them or that I should ignore it. It’s not realistic to assume that I can pick and choose my bad days. Of course, this is a fair boundary to set if I was putting too much pressure on her, but I was already trying my hardest to avoid complications and all she saw was my low energy and quiet nature (I never once vented to her). It was unrealistic to assume I could just become happy and energetic whenever I saw her, so we cut ties with the understanding that it was only doing more harm between us. 

Being compassionate can be different for everyone too, but one trick which is useful is to ask what you’d say or do if a close friend or family member came to you like this. If a friend came to me distraught about only getting a B, what would I say or do? When I used to get a B, I had panic attacks, I was anxious, upset, I felt useless and hated myself. I was stupid and a failure and a disappointment with a tarnished reputation. Would I say that to anyone else? Never. I’d never tell my friend that they were a disappointment for something like that. I’d never hate them for not hitting their grades. They wouldn’t be useless or stupid. I’d comfort them and tell them that it was a one off situation. That everyone has bad days, and that nobody gets a perfect score every time. I’d maybe reassure them about their other recent successes, or explain that they can now see where they need to improve. That it wasn’t the end of the world, and that that single grade didn’t define them. Why would I treat myself so poorly when I wouldn’t anybody else? It’s because I didn’t give myself any respect and held myself at a different level. It was okay for other people to be human and make mistakes, but not me. There was a different rule for me. If my friend missed my phone call, it wasn’t a big deal, but if I missed their call, it was an obvious reason for them to hate me. After a while I realised that sometimes I justified things which didn’t make sense and told myself things which just weren’t true. I began showing myself compassion and caring for myself as a human, just like everyone else. One which makes mistakes and isn’t perfect. One who doesn’t have to prove them self, and who deserves respect just because they exist. 

If I can’t make it to the gym today? That’s okay. One day won’t hurt. If I don’t feel like eating. How about you try something small, anything is better than nothing. I failed that test - it’s alright, nobody is perfect. You know where you need to improve and you’ll get another chance - it’s not the end of the world. I feel shit and I want to hurt myself. How about I try something else first. Maybe take a nice bath, or grab a chocolate. Watch a good film with a blanket and teddy. We can have a night off from work, because it won’t be productive and will probably lack in quality anyway, and you need some time to recharge after a long day. You forget the homework? Don’t panic! Just explain to them why, and try not to stress. They know it was an accident, you’ve had a lot on your mind, and they know you’re struggling at the moment. You’ve never missed it before, so they know it’s not the type of person you are - your reputation won’t be tarnished and they won’t hate you. 

Treat yourself like a close friend or child. Cheer on your small accomplishments and set little goals for yourself that you can be proud of, even if nobody else is. Reward yourself and treat yourself sometimes (I can buy a book because I want it - I don’t have to do anything to earn it), and take things slowly. For many people, you are your own worst critic. I have a very supportive environment, but I’m never going to get anywhere if I treat myself like a sub-human."
mentalhealth,fqrl3zl,t1_fqrhnt4,1589586549.0,"It sounds like you hold yourself to expectations you’re struggling to meet, and judge your self worth based on them. Of course, I don’t know the people around you and how much they contribute to this, but as you said, I think I huge step would be dropping these unrealistic expectations. I was never happy with my college grades because people set unrealistic goals for me. I beat myself up about it so much, thinking if I couldn’t meet them, I was useless. But taking a step back and looking at it from a different, or objective viewpoint made me realise that these goals and expectations were next to impossible.I was hating myself because I wasn’t superhuman. Tearing down this pressure may help you be more comfortable with t idea of just being you, not the paranoia of ever being ‘enough’ for others. 

And this is opening up. This is good. Talking about your emotions, your stresses, your worries and feelings regarding where you are and your concerns about the future. It was extremely helpful for me to identify my thoughts and feelings and look at why I was feeling them. Why am I scared of help? Why won’t I ask for it? Why am I so scared of doing wrong and disappointing others, and are these expectations and rules I hold myself to realistic? 

In my case, I found I had one rule for myself and another rule for everyone else - I didn’t treat myself with any compassion or understanding. It was okay for others to mess up but not me. Perhaps you look at others one way and yourself another. I’ve started trying to talk to myself as a close friend, and only then I realised how cruel I was to myself. Identifying the problem is the first step in helping it."
mentalhealth,fqrh1by,t1_fqrefmt,1589584196.0,"Of course it’ll be different for everyone. These days I’m not specifically struggling with depression (the episodes go on and off), and my experiences of such have been a little abnormal so personal experience may not be useful in one regard. But even still, I’ve found that the pace is different depending on many things. Some friends have managed to get help in a few months. Others will likely have lifelong experiences with depression or other mental illnesses. I think it’s a tough question because for one of my friends, answering an email may be nothing and they may struggle more with negative self image, but for me, I may struggle with an email but have a better self image. It comes down to the individual, but there shouldn’t be an expectation of a quick fix from anyone. As I said, a mindset like yours or mine takes years of creating, so people should understand that it may take months or years to improve. 

And yeah, I struggle with the concept of nothing I do ever being good enough. It’s been forced on me in some aspects (a high pressure schooling environment has made me panic and become distressed if I make any kind of mistake or if something I do isn’t perfect). As cheesy as it sounds, you don’t need to prove yourself to anyone. That was a huge factor in helping my view. You don’t need to prove anything to anyone. You don’t need to be useful. You don’t need to do anything to make you valuable. Just existing is enough to deserve love and help. Try and focus more on yourself rather than being enough for others. I emailed my college mental health team today. I was so fucking nervous and telling anyone else may not understand the importance. But I’m proud of myself. If I couldn’t have done it, it doesn’t make me useless or undeserving. I think you have a lack of understanding people in your environment, by the sound of it."
mentalhealth,fqrdd2t,t1_fqraymg,1589582150.0,"I know it’s a long road. It can be tiring and hopeless at some points. At some points you’ll look at how far you’ve come and think nothing of it, or how long you’ve got to go and it seems impossible. Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t wake up and become an overwhelming optimist without a negative thought. I have good days and I have bad days. But any progress is progress, and you don’t have to take the entire journey all at once. It’s intimidating, and for many there is no end point. Things just get better, you don’t reach any specific goal. You realise after a while that you haven’t had the urges, or it suddenly hits you one day that you enjoy life. You get better at controlling the negative thoughts and feelings. 

Maybe try to take things slow, and make anyone who tries to help aware of this. No one will judge you for being overwhelmed or finding things too much at once. Sometimes for me, a success is just answering an email or ringing my mental health team to book an appointment. Take things slow, dont overwhelm yourself or put too much pressure on yourself to improve instantly. These feelings and thoughts have been the result of years of trauma or pressure or whatever you have lived through, so they won’t be fixed overnight. But like I said, there isn’t one end goal, rather, small victories which should be acknowledged"
mentalhealth,fqra9wx,t1_fqr8bgl,1589580516.0,"You keep instantly shooting down everything people say. You don’t take on any advice or comments, and instead only comment on self arm ideation, or shoot down options instantly. You have tried one form of help, but perhaps you went in with the wrong expectations or that specific kind of therapy doesn’t work for you. Even perhaps it was the wrong therapist (it’s important to try a few until you find one that works for you). 

You have negative thoughts, and although you appear to dislike them and your life at the moment, you need to try and tap into your emotions more and open up. Be realistic and find the cause of the pain and negativity. What can you do about it? How can you combat these thoughts? If you want to hurt yourself, try and find methods of avoiding it, or harm reduction. Just putting it off for five or ten minutes more than normal is still progress. You need to actively try and improve your thinking or position, rather than instantly focus on the negative and ignore everything else. (Positive thinking probably won’t be your norm, but recognising these negative thoughts is the first step to stopping or controlling them). If you can’t find the energy to do this, then it’s clearly something you need professional help with. In this case, refer to my previous comments - there isn’t just one kind of help so don’t shoot t idea because you tried one thing."

mentalhealth,fqr4qww,t1_fqr368f,1589577568.0,"So many reasons, both in terms of mental and physical health. The obvious signs are the scars, the risk of infection, the risk of going too deep and causing permanent injury or even accidentally bleeding out. It’s a destructive coping mechanism and there are much better methods of coping and releasing anger (even snapping an elastic band on your arm or holding ice cubes can cause a similar release but can lack the risk). And, like all addictions, you become numb to it overtime. Starting out, one cut or a shallow one will help, however this will not satisfy after a while. The number of depth increases until no amount or no depth will satisfy. You will likely get to the point that you could cut your entire arm and not feel the rush you once did. There are many other issues too. While it may be a successful (despite destructive) coping mechanism for you at the moment, saying there is nothing wrong with cutting may encourage some to start if they come across this post."

As long as it doesn’t become the norm. As I said, bad days will happen, and maybe even bad weeks (or in some cases, bad months) but in the long run, one day or one week won’t hurt. So long as you don’t fall back into your old habits and give up entirely, skipping your walk or having a small treat is okay. Take things slow and soon it won’t even feel different to you.

EDAnonymous,fqgovct,t3_gitktr,1589352397.0,"I think that’s actually super common, and definitely something I experience. Even non-ED guys get those period cravings rough. For me, I try and up my calories to maintenance if I’m struggling, that way I can eat a bit more sweet stuff. That or I find low cal alternative. One trick I’ve also found is to find something that is almost impossible to binge on, for whatever reason. For my that was chocolate soya milk. The chocolate helps my cravings but I don’t like the taste of soya milk in general, which comes out after about a glass or so. As such, I almost never binge it (I could normally down chocolate milk quicker than two shakes of a lambs tail) but it still satisfies me. See if you could find something like that?  

I know it’s really difficult and you can feel really guilty, especially mixed with the bloating that comes with it, but just remember that it’s your body, not your actions doing this. You haven’t failed or done anything wrong, it’s healthy and normal, even if it’s annoying as hell, to have these cravings and bloating (within reason of cause). Good luck, though.

progresspics,fqgo8ng,t1_fqgjlzv,1589351848.0,"I know I’m not OP but 5”4 here and 37lbs down. And I think you know your exact problem - you started too much at once and could keep it up. I was like that for years, and could never stick to my new diet or exercise plan because I expected too much of myself or planned it while feeling motivated and then life hit. 

As strange as it sounds, start now. Like this second. Don’t start Monday or next month, because for me that always made it a challenge or pushed it off further. I messed up my diet on Wednesday, so now I have to throw away the whole week. Don’t bother. Each day is a fresh day and you don’t need a fresh start every time. Bad days will come, it’s getting back on track that matters. 

As for starting, literally the smallest things will help. For me, it was taking a short walk at night 20-30 minutes and trying to drink more water. Then I reduced my portions slightly. Then I cut back on my chocolate and junk food. Slowly, a few weeks in, I started eating more fruit and salads and such. It wasn’t until a few months and maybe 10lbs down when I started exercising. Then I went to the gym and did minimal. I could barely make an hour sometimes. I’ve built up my exercise overtime as my strength and fitness has improved. 

I found a huge part of the starting problem was caused by overthinking. I thought too much about my new diet and exercise plan, or I thought that doing one small thing wasn’t enough. I held my expectations of myself too highly, and gave up upon a single bad day. My inspiration and occasionally my motivation failed me. But if you’ve got a significant amount to lose, you’re in it for a long journey. These small changes will become habits, and all these small habits will add up, and trust me when I say once you see you’re losing weight, you’ll start and feel more and more motivated. Starting is the hardest part, and good luck to you."

I’ve tried about 7 different creams and tablets, some haven’t done anything, some only made mild improvements, others cleared it but only temporary. I haven’t cracked the code yet, but I’m currently on no meds and while my skin isn’t clear, it’s 1000% better than 4 years ago (even while I was using meds and cream)

I know the struggle and how frustrating it can be, but in the meantime, perhaps see if you can find anything else which triggers it. Some people find certain foods like anything really greasy, dairy, or chocolate make them break out worse. For some, specific skin care items. Drying out your skin too much or moisturise with oil-based cleansers may also make it worse. For me, the only times I really flare up now are the week before my period (though little can be done about that) and when I’m under a lot of stress or I’m very run down, so for me, I know my acne will calm down if I take good care of my mental health (as strange as it sounds). I’m not saying this will cure it (I’ve heard enough bullshit ‘cures’ in my years) however it may make it a little more manageable in the meantime while you find the prescription that’s right for you. It may also improve with age too - teenage, and even hormones in your early 20s can play a huge factor in it. I hope any of this can be of help. Just try to be patient, and trust me when I say you’re not the only one who has struggled with this, and while irritating at the time and often a cause of being self conscious, it is very common and definitely manageable.
