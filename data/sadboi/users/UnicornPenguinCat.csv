In Australia more generally there was a fair push from the community to take action on this early. In Victoria where I live, there was a lot of pressure put on the State Government to cancel the Grand Prix (car race) back in early March due to the huge potential for a blow up in cases. They were reluctant at first, but finally did cancel it on the morning it was due to start. Before any social distancing rules were formally put in place, a lot of people started voluntarily working from home if they had the option to, and bike tracks saw a big increase in cyclists, presumably because people wanted to stay off of peak hour public transport which can be extremely crowded here.

AskReddit,fntw2cb,t1_fnrxtnv,1587249691.0,"Also ""sat"" in a sentence like ""I was sat at the bus stop"" tells me the writer is probably British. In Australian English we would say ""I was sitting at the bus stop"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think North Americans would also use ""sitting""?"

Walking behind a strongly perfumed person seems to be the worst, I'll often slow down so I'm at least 10 metres behind them."

CoronavirusDownunder,fnsrsb8,t1_fns53oa,1587227568.0,"> i believe many of us were watching development in italy start to take off, and actually began acting out social distancing and other safety measures two weeks before the government pushed the message.

Anecdotally, commuter bike traffic on our local track increased a lot before any formal social distancing measures were announced, I think people were getting edgy about being on crowded trains and looking for safer ways to get to work. Quite a few people on the track looked like they hadn't been on a bike in quite some time. Colleague at work said her neighbour had followed her to the city on his bike because it was his first ever time riding to work and he didn't know the way. 

I'm sure all of these actions helped."

Not implying that racism isn't a problem in Australia, it most certainly is, but it seemed to me that a major reason for Chinatowns and restaurants emptying out was fewer Chinese (or Chinese background) customers. And probably for good reason too.. way better awareness at that point of the seriousness of this virus than the rest of the Australian population. And honestly thank fuck for that, or we could be in a very different situation."
