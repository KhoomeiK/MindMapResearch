Like I said it’s probably only something you could figure out exactly from a scan or something. Just be careful with it and try not to use it a lot if it’s a day where it’s been bothering you.

Light Stretching is always good for movement as well!"
explainlikeimfive,fprpf83,t1_fprmx83,1588859420.0,"Yeah basically things like that aren’t really a huge issue until later in life. Aside from getting some pointless scans that might just tell you you have a lower amount of cartilage or “padding” between joints, there’s not really much they can or would want to do for a while. Just be cautious of it and if it causes you a lot of pain then get it checked out. 

If it’s only rubbing/grinding and you don’t have any trouble using it or pain, I’m sure it’s fine being left alone. It will probably give you some issues later in life though as you get older. My mom just had some surgery on her shoulder last year where they filed down some of her bone that was getting rubbed with joint movement. Kinda like if there was a burr on a bearing, I think there was a spur type thing they filed down so her shoulder would move more freely and not be as painful

TL;DR: basically it would be more of a pain and take more away from your life to fix it now when you are young and it isn’t bothering you, than when you’re old and it’s more worn out anyways. 

Plus, I think we will come a long ways in joint replacement advancement. My grandfather had both his knees done at separate times, (long time ago) and he sort of always had bad knees after that. My friend’s dad got both his knees done within the same year (about 2012?) and he regularly plays golf still and works at a workshop. So in the future, I think we’ll be well off"
