You're not giving him an ultimatum as far as choosing. He's being put in a position by THEM because THEY can't be respectful/decent, and he's learning boundaries. The position is being created by his desire to be a better person and them not stepping up, not by you. I know that it feels like it's you because you're the one who's enforcing a boundary, but that's just a trick that passive abusers use to make other people feel the guilt for actions of theirs that they refuse to take responsibility for"

The work is in a startup that had just started before this whole shutdown and is based on events, so I'm not getting paid yet. She's been using my bed tray as a desk, I would love to upgrade her to something she can use my janky old laptop on and still have space to write things. Plus, I have a care package I'd really like to send to a critical care nurse friend of mine, but haven't gotten it together to pay for the shipping. There are certainly people who have more dire needs than mine, but my little girl is working so hard so I thought I'd throw my hat in the ring.

I posted a request for assistance the other day for a filter for my air purifier, and from what I can see in my PMs and with the amazon wishlist, it is not fulfilled. My daughter has allergies to dust mites, and she and I both have a light touch of mast cell activation disorder, so when we don't catch our allergy triggers quickly enough, they turn into us being sick for a bit. So, she's been coughing a lot and it turned into a sinus infection (as it often does) and  almost turned into bronchitis and I've been giving her generic kid's mucinex and generic benedryl which thankfully we are able to get covered by insurance but I hate to keep giving her all of that stuff. And I'm also scratchy throated etc. as of the beginning of this week. Anyway I realized that this probably is connected to the fact that I turned the air purifier off about two weeks ago in our (shared) bedroom because it was beeping loudly and I finally checked the manual and either the filter needs replacing or its UV light, but it's beeping even when the UV light is off. I took out the pre-filter and it was made more of dust than carbon, the filter itself I think I can salvage for another month or two if need be. The pre-filters cost about $16 on amazon for the 4 pack, and I think I can turn it back on with that. Someone suggested trying the swiffer dusters as pre-filters, but I looked and don't have any left of those unfortunately. Also, I do only have $5 for gas for the rest of the week and I'm on less than a half a tank after spending $20 of the last $25 I had, so that's where the other $4 would go. I would love to not have her keep missing school from being so impacted by allergies, and to have it so that she won't even be able to go because I can't get her there with no gas! (Her school is a 45 minute drive). Sorry for the length of this, I'm only good at editing other people's writing.

My favorite color is purple. My favorite type of cat is Siamese. My daughter's favorite cat is a tabby, and she wants one soooo badly, and when we're in the financial place where I can make a post like the one you're making (which hopefully will be within the next 2 years?!) I plan to adopt one, even though I'm a dog person and really prefer Siamese.

Most importantly, thank you for even offering and on the off chance that whoever you pick forgets to say thank you or is too overwhelmed to say thank you, I will say now that I really appreciate you making this post, and congratulations on getting to the point where losing out on $20 doesn't feel like a big deal.

Even if you feel like you should be able to handle it on your own and feel like you don't want to take resources from somebody who needs it more (which is a false, invasive thought if you're thinking it, so know that you aren't taking from anyone regardless of what abusive shmucks tell you), this is not appropriate to handle on your own. It SHOULD take a village. And you deserve one, just because you're human. I'm sure there are many other reasons, too, but even if there weren't, you do. Your kids deserve you to get that help, too. 

And OPs husband, if you've gotten to the point where you've forced her to let you read this... Maybe you don't realize what you're doing crosses the line. Maybe you're anxious and worried and insecure, and that's why you act this way. That's a reason, but it's not an excuse. Take this as a lesson: this behavior is abusive, controlling, and a good reason TO leave, rather than something that should prevent her from leaving. Stop it. Be supportive and loving by giving breathing space, asking questions you actually will listen to and respect the actual answer that's HER answer to it, how SHE means it, NOT how you take it. If it concerns you, say ""I'm concerned,"" not ""that's negative"" because you know what? Saying that kind of crap is at least as negative as whatever her inner voice may be saying. Cut it out, or you deserve to be left. Step up and be A PARTNER, a STRONG one, NOT a forceful one!

OP, you deserve better. You deserve help. You deserve partnership. You deserve experiences where you're worth it. Keep reaching out. Just *go* to therapy. Just *take* your prescribed medication, as prescribed. Just put one foot in front of the other and know that this sisterhood who's been through this too has got your back, your arms, and has broad shoulders and lots of tissues."

And it makes sense that you are more ok with your toddler, who is now more independent, being cared for by someone new than your infant. It also makes sense that the grandparents want to keep the bond/routine going that they've already established and not necessarily upend their lives and juggle two kids, or even one newborn when they've just gotten through that phase and are seeing their efforts pay off with your toddler. 

I wonder if you were to find in home ""mother's helper"" level care whenever your in laws are watching your kid(s), if they'd be ok with keeping both, knowing the responsibility isn't all on them? Then, even though there's a stranger/new person involved, it's with their supervision, so to speak.

That being said, I had a friend who was a guy who got kicked out of his house. My parents let him stay with us for about 2 months, I think, and he only left because he ended up getting a more stable situation with other family of his. They let a friend of my sister's stay also, when a similar situation happened for him. Both of these were when we were in high school. You may be surprised, and you can always ask. Worst case, you get a ""no"" and then you're in the same place you're in now, but at least you know about whether or not you can turn to those places.

The other thing that I'll say is DO talk to your teachers, your school counselors, etc. YES it will be awkward. YES it sucks.

married to anyone dropping the charade?

JUSTNOMIL,f1e1qf6,t1_f1d8uky,1569409717.0,"People with mental illness are, as a general rule, more likely to be **victims** of violent crime than **perpetrators** of violent crime. Mental illness is the furthest thing from an excuse for a physical altercation. Do with that what you will."

Marriage,f10jox2,t3_d7irvj,1569113576.0,"Change anyway. Accept that she needs space. Be present for her but not in her face. Do sweet things... consistently. Don't make her give you the chance for you to prove that you can change, just DO it. and start by listening to her (as in, she told you that she needs space, and you listen and stop pushing) and allowing her the space and time to process and to think. Respecting what she says she needs is a change that will clearly need to be made, so start there."
AskMenOver30,f10hl1n,t3_d7951o,1569112668.0,"First of all, as many others have said, your dad was an alcoholic. Whether or not he felt he could stop, or drank frequently or only occasionally, reacting to alcohol that way and continuing to drink anyway is a definition of alcoholic.

Secondly, family has many different definitions and many different ways of functioning. You can definitely grey rock them. Tell them what you're comfortable sharing with them, and let them be the ones who feel pissed if that's what they need to feel but that's neither your fault nor your responsibility. From what you say, they don't seem able to take responsibility for how their parenting impacted your desire to relate to them. Maybe they're willing, maybe not, but it doesn't seem like they're able. There's nothing you can or could've done to change that, that's on them. But don't bother telling them that you don't like to if they're not interested in hearing why and really listening. Hearing why just to argue back doesn't count. 

You are NOT being a bag guy at all here. Even if they were objectively very good parents in every possible way, that doesn't obligate you to be an open book to them. Find other things to talk about when you spend time together; sports, games, movies, whatever. If you fill the conversation with those things, there won't be time for them to ask about your life, and they may not even notice as much that you're not telling them about yourself. They'll hear you talking to them and making some kind of connection, and it seems like that's what they're most interested in.  And who knows, maybe them listening to what you have to say about easier topics will help rebuild the relationship. Maybe not. Either way, it's okay, and this is part of being an adult."
