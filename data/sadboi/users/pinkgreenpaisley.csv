StudentNurse,es24wgw,t3_c5fe6y,1561513981.0,"If a study guide is available as each unit starts, I fill it out IN CLASS as we cover each topic. Often I copy and paste from the power points and then type in anything else important covered in lecture.

I’ve also typed my notes directly into Quizlet. As things get more complex in Adult Health and senior-level classes, this is less effective. For those classes, I like to supplement what I learned in lecture with you tube videos to get the basics of a concept. I’ll listen to either Registered Nurse RN or Cathy Parkes YouTube videos, and take handwritten notes. If you really “get” a concept, you may find you can then answer test questions without a ton of memorization. But I also recommend doing mnemonics or making up whatever you can to help you remember things—signs and symptoms, or adverse effects of drugs, etc.

Lately, I’ve tried recording myself reading my notes out loud and that helps, too, for times when I just don’t feel like I’m absorbing the info. 

After all of this...practice questions. Lots of them! 

Classes like patho, pharm, and your adult healths, you will need to start studying way further out. As you get the hang of school, I find things like OB and Peds can be started a little later. 

Good luck!"
AskWomenOver30,ery1lnc,t3_c4kivc,1561398374.0,"I had a typical undergrad experience, worked way under my potential during that time and got a business degree just because it made the most sense. Had a decent career, but it wasn’t fulfilling, it was just stressful corporate BS work. Always felt I needed an academic/college do-over. I am back in school for nursing and will be graduating in December at the age of 44. I had to take my science prerequisites and enroll in a BSN program, total of 2.5 years and about $55k. I’ve never been prouder of a decision and am doing amazingly well academically and feel passionate and challenged. No one cares about my age. It actually benefits me. The time will pass regardless! You can do it!"
AskWomen,ery0qxt,t1_erxv9yk,1561397830.0,"Agree. I am completely unable to fake conversations, even with my family. I’ve found it’s more painful to fake my way through hard times than it is to admit I’m just not feeling up to socializing."
Anxiety,erna5y1,t3_c2sucj,1561048104.0,"The BP medicine might not be a bad thing—propanolol? It’s more for performance anxiety—public speaking, test taking—but it does work on the heart rate and BP, which rise during anxiety. It may help! On the other hand, I have used Xanax for 20 plus years, usually given way more than I need, and have never abused it. I think it’s sad that they won’t try you on a small dose."
Anxiety,ern9qbp,t1_erllp9z,1561047822.0,"I have this exact scenario going on. Every single thing you just said. I find it more disturbing than ever, now that my kids are 14 and 9 and well aware that something’s up with mom. I have done awful things to my husband. Learning that irritability is a symptom of anxiety made me feel better, but it hasn’t stopped me from feeling irritable. I spend a ton of time isolating from my family out of shame."
Anxiety,ern9b1a,t1_erlz1k0,1561047542.0,"Thank you for verbalizing exactly what I was just trying to tell my husband, after he had to pick me up from a panic attack I just had while driving my son to camp. I hate that my two boys who I love so much have to see my affected by this. My husband is understanding but I have so much shame that he has to put up with me."
