ptsd,estft34,t3_c8vw2k,1562266601.0,"Hi, I have had severe PTSD for many years. I joined here just a couple of days ago. Welcome."
ptsd,espcc8l,t3_c8kw8f,1562182181.0,"I suggest you read more about PTSD and google vets talking about their symptoms. If the person with PTSD plays a major role in your story, then you can't just get by with limited research. You have to know your character much better. PTSD is not just one thing but comes out in different ways and interacts with a person's personality and life situation and prior history of mental health problems. There are vets with PTSD who are on the street or are suicidal and nearly completely disabled and there are those who hold a job and have relationships and live a productive life."
ptsd,espb98i,t1_esp9jbu,1562181712.0,"I see. Do you have a list of things that relax you or make you feel good in a peaceful way? Like calling a friend, watching a comedy, taking a hot shower, doing yoga, listening to relaxing music, playing with a pet, drawing, going for a walk, having a favorite snack, doing your nails, helping others (whether online or in person), doing a hobby, daydreaming, reading a spiritual or inspirational book, etc? Think of resources you have available."
ptsd,esp9be4,t3_c8rgrs,1562180865.0,"Hi, that sounds awful. I also struggle with my own hypervigilance. It's like being on the edge all the time. Do you have a therapist or are you on some medications for this? One of the things therapists usually recommend is breathing exercises, or grounding techniques. These exercises don't do magic, but work well if you keep practicing them because they train your mind to stop racing. I know, it's really hard. For me, I sometimes switch between different techniques because for instance focusing on my breathing sometimes makes me more anxious. Good luck to you."
ptsd,esmyaj6,t3_c8f6hr,1562117997.0,"I think I understand what you're saying. While you agree that certain things that may not appear capable of causing trauma, may indeed cause trauma for some people at certain points in their life, you are having an issue people who use the word PTSD  lightly and without thought.  Indeed, they may not know what terrible pain it is to live with trauma. Reminds me of someone online jokingly he was suicidal after he couldn't find a favorite computer game."

ptsd,esm3s75,t3_c8d3pi,1562097638.0,"I'm sorry about your experiences, that is terrible. I can't really offer any help as the question of repressed memories is quite complicated. Both possibilities are plausible. Sometimes therapists or patients think they must be something so therapists keep digging in memories and end up accidentally planting false memories. And sometimes they unintentionally ignore what are real repressed memories of trauma. I think they themselves may not know, and discover as they go along. I just hope you have a therapist and a good one, and you can figure it out. Try to be patient with the process."
ptsd,esm32vj,t3_c8ceq7,1562097211.0,"That's an interesting question 4DankInhale20. It's really hard to say. As nazar10001 says, in your case it appears related to your trauma given the timing factor, but I also want to say that don't be under the impression that everybody else feels calm by contemplating the immensity of universe. Many philosophers and religious writers have felt an existential dread when they thought about how big the universe is and how comparatively small and insignificant they are. Astronomers have not been able to find signs of human life anywhere either so even humanity as a whole appears to be alone. 

Of course, this kind of thought be the kind of thought one has when feeling contemplative or watching a show about space, or it can be much more emotionally intense dread that follows one everywhere.

For me, I am not calmed by considering how big the universe is. Perhaps I have reached the upper bounds of my anxiety (""thanks to"" my PTSD) already. 

The bigness of it all just makes me wonder. That there may be a reason to it all, a kind of design, an intelligence, a consciousness, a power, something.... But what? And what for? And more importantly, where do I fit in all this? Could I play an important role (despite everything that has happened to me)? 

I hope you feel better and not emotionally bothered by these thoughts."
ptsd,esm1nbm,t3_c8cahp,1562096352.0,"Sorry to hear about your friend and you having seen it all. It sounds awful.

Yes, it is possible. You need to speak to a health professional to get diagnosed. PTSD involves not just exposure to a traumatic event but also certain thoughts and feelings like guilt, feeling numb/detached, easily startled, and lots of avoidant behavior. Just to give you an idea, here are a few questions you might ponder (middle of the page, questions 1-5).

ptsd,esm0zae,t3_c88w4q,1562095988.0,"Just a warning to people who are considering self-medicating with weed, talk to your doctor first. People react differently to marijuana, and especially if they are on other medications and have health issues, it can have serious side effects. Just be safe."
ptsd,esm0jb0,t3_c8c7zj,1562095752.0,"You know, if people around you are unusually loud you have the power to tell them to be considerate. Sometimes people are not aware how their actions may affect others.

&#x200B;

Having said that, I am not always so sensitized but it happens when I get triggered (and my triggers are too many to list). Which sadly happens too often. But once every few weeks I have had a good chunk of a day when I felt good.

&#x200B;

I think in PTSD, people spend far too much of their time feeling vigilant. They can't relax. So everything becomes magnified. They're always on edge so it doesn't take much to push them over. It's a painful way of living.

I hope you get better."
ptsd,esje3a9,t3_c818a0,1562031281.0,I'm sorry to hear that. I'm going through something very similar. Had terrible dreams last night. You are not alone.
