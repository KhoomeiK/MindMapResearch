DecidingToBeBetter,fahwcx2,t3_e933h8,1576094862.0,I wish I can be as brave as you are. I feel almost welded to my current shit job I hate.
depression,fahuv15,t1_fahupk7,1576093978.0,Point me here problems that keeping you in unhealthy state. How know - maybe we'll be able to find a solution or at least a way you can present it to your therapist :)
depression,fahuoyl,t1_fahtw3r,1576093878.0,"I'm not asking for sharing on public post your home address so don't be so shy : D I'm sure that your cookies are killers(in good way). If you'd had an enerdy, just let me know :D"
depression,fahu2ns,t1_fahtf8j,1576093508.0,"I feel you, I really do! I had my first suicidal thoughts when I was about 7-8 yo. I've came through different periods since then but I never fell good with myself good and today(26yo) I still have no purpose in life. I'm functional - I learned how to pretend relative happiness, but the truth is that I don't want to live anymore. 

I'd purpose a meet up, just to make a tost for our solitude, but I'm bet we're divided by thousands of miles. Hah"
depression,fahtiwq,t3_e9bv58,1576093181.0,So you accepted yourself. What more do you want from your therapist?

depression,fahswwa,t3_e9brau,1576092813.0,"I wish I could say something inspiring, something that will change your life and you'll feel good from since. However, my expirience forces me to say that if you already gave up, your life will be - at best scenario - the same for the rest of time. Nonetheless, I hope that you'll cope better than me and you'll be fine at some point. 

Why you feel that way anyway?"
depression,fahs2kr,t3_e9bh0j,1576092303.0,"Hiding is comfortable, but it strengthen running away reflex. Next occasion will be more difficult if you decide to spending christmas alone this time."
depression,fahr771,t1_fahquzy,1576091778.0,"No worries, it's ok. I really was so focues on my suicidal thoughts that I didn't think about potential consequences of my drunk actions. Your realistic comment was acctauly good point and I really thank for that. 

A bucket of cold water is good sometimes."
depression,fahqm5x,t1_fahq8ik,1576091426.0,"Good point, I didn't think about that. Thanks for bringing my attention to that."
depression,fahq7xj,t3_e8wf5e,1576091183.0,Happy birthday! Feel free to contact on Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve!
depression,fahpl7d,t1_fahod1b,1576090797.0,"It's funny that I wish yo myself that I'll get drunk to the point I'll be able to make something against my self-preservance instinct, like cutting wrists or driving - as fast as my car can - against the wall. I guess we're on opposite sides of the 'mirror' right now. 

Anyway, it's sad to read about stuff you have to deal with during your life. I'm sending good vibes and imaginary hug, hah."
