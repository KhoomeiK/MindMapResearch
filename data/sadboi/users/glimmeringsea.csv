Also, one of those shootings was a domestic violence situation involving a man who killed another adult in a school admin office, no kids implicated. These shootings are often not related to students at all and are not remotely ""bullies made me do it"" or crazed Nikolas Cruz (who *was* reported to the FBI yet nothing happened) situations.

If you're looking for a utopia where there's no violence or crime or anything bad, good luck and godspeed. That's simply childish and absurd thinking. You probably think one more death from Covid is unacceptable, too. Oof."

There were seven school shootings in school buildings during actual school hours in 2019 (an important distinction based on how the data regarding school shootings is manipulated). For some perspective, there are ~133,000 K-12 schools in the US. [And even NPR has investigated and contested the disturbingly misleading and grossly inaccurate reporting of school shootings.]( https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/08/27/640323347/the-school-shootings-that-werent) But it seems like the narrative surrounding this phenomenon is [""facts be damned.""](https://news.northeastern.edu/2018/02/26/schools-are-still-one-of-the-safest-places-for-children-researcher-says/) Faulty perception, ghoulishly hyperbolic media reports, and willfully innumerate people are what's ""messed up.""

Anyway, [look up who committed this shooting](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colorado-shooting/transgender-teen-accused-in-deadly-colorado-school-shooting-wanted-revenge-idUSKCN1TM09T)--basically the opposite of the maligned and slandered Covington kids.

You need to schedule an appointment with an actual RD when you have the cash if you want real professional advice. 

These subreddits are good places to ask questions about weight loss, diet, and exercise:

https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/

https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/

https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/

https://www.reddit.com/r/CICO/

Also, I'm not an RD but don't advise a low-fat diet unless you have a medical reason to do so; healthy fats are extremely beneficial for your overall health as well as satiating. You should probably see a doctor when you have the chance to rule out thyroid problems, insulin resistance, etc., though health issues typically only contribute a small amount to weight gain and obesity. 

Good luck."

Most government healthcare around the world comes with obscene taxes like in France or is a mixed system of public and private. 

I can see a psychologist through my insurance without any referral.

I'm not talking about massages. People lambast the US for inadequate access to mental health services all the time, but I never really see anything about Canada's issues, which is interesting: ""The Canada Health Act covers the services of psychiatrists, medical doctors with additional training in psychiatry. In Canada, psychiatrists tend to focus on the treatment of mental illness with medication. However, the Canada Health Act excludes care provided in a 'hospital or institution primarily for the mentally disordered.' Some institutional care is provided by provinces. The Canada Health Act does not cover treatment by a psychologist or psychotherapist unless the practitioner is also a medical doctor. . . . The cost of treatment by a psychologist or psychotherapist in Canada has been cited as a contributing factor in the high suicide rate among first responders such as police officers, EMTs and paramedics. According to a CBC report, some police forces 'offer benefits plans that cover only a handful of sessions with community psychologists, forcing those seeking help to join lengthy waiting lists to seek free psychiatric assistance.'"""
pics,fpilg1s,t1_fpihqsn,1588643362.0,">What I have is not semi decent, it's probably one of the best in the nation. 

What I'm saying is that millions of Americans still have ample to excellent coverage that won't lead to ruin if they have to undergo treatment for a major or chronic health issue or a catastrophic accident. I think it's a gross mischaracterization on Reddit that most people in the US have essentially worthless plans with outrageous deductibles. Further, if I had a high-deductible plan, I'd never go to the ER for a non-emergent reason like viral testing. People need to learn a bit about the system before using it imo, and I do think that sort of information should be more accessible and clear.

>What I have is what everyone should have as a government mandated benefit.

You do realize that even somewhere like Canada with its provincially-based healthcare, people don't receive free comprehensive treatment and services, no? [For that reason, something like 65% of Canadians opt to pay for supplemental private health insurance:](https://www.surehealth.ca/pages/supplemental-health-insurance.html) ""Medicare, Canada’s publicly-funded health care program, merely covers residents for fundamental medical services. Though the system is ever-changing its benefit policies, you’re probably still not receiving coverage for key health care services like: Prescription drugs; Routine and enhanced dental procedures; Prescription eyewear; **Registered specialists and therapists.""** There are many more flaws within the Canadian system that I won't get into here, and while we definitely need an overhaul in the US (I won't hold my breath), I think it's vitally important to realize that nothing is perfect or truly ""free"" for that matter."
