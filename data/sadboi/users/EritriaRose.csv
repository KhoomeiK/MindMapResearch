Look, if you don't want to date us then don't. Just leave. We're difficult to handle. We get it but don't clump is all into one category and demonize us.

Your ex probably had some issues that were unresolved. They're hurting and not in the right frame of mind. Why the hell are you dating someone who isn't in the right place to do so? 

I mean I sympathize with anyone that has to deal with a person that is chaotic. But the thing is you can walk away from us. We can't walk away. We're stuck. I truly am sorry if they dealt with the bad side of BPD. I know I've had my demons.

But you don't have to bash us. Most of us are dealing with severe trauma. We are still learning and growing. We constantly live in survival mode. It sucks for us too. We might not be at The point where we realize we have a problem. This is because we are trapped in fight or flight mode.  We do things on instinct.

You don't have to save us. You don't have to deal with us. If you're not the type of person who can handle a mental illness that is okay too. No one expects you to be a hero. 

But maybe consider that your ex was triggered by someone so horrible and that's why they reacted they did.

I don't think most of us did. We have to learn as we go. And sometimes we screw it all up. It's devastating.

I've had so many people leave me. Abuse me. Give up on me. So I get what everyone else is going through."
BPD,fkycbv5,t3_fl4b0k,1584645911.0,Oh this is me. I'll take so hard. But then smile and act like everything is peachy.
BorderlinePDisorder,fkyc3yv,t3_fle7mz,1584645787.0,"Yes. But the first years too WORK. A lot of forgives and understanding from my bf.

I never in my life tried so hard for someone. I do not want to lose him. The battle to be better can be so overwhelming. This relationship SAVED me. I'd do anything to keep it.

Yes I still tried to run. Yes I was still a mess. Yes I had bad days. So nothing is magical and perfect by any means. 

But we both give this relationship anything we have. We recently celebrated 10 years."
bipolar2,fkybt08,t3_flds3o,1584645614.0,"Someone told me to take deep breaths today. I told her I'll punch her in the face of she ever tells me that again.

Like PLEASE leave me TF alone. Certain things do not work on me if all it took was a couple deep breaths I wouldn't have a fucking problem"
BPD,fko6is9,t3_fjipzz,1584381070.0,"I hear flies (not see) and it makes me super paranoid.

I had this one bad experience. I cannot tell if the fly was in my hair/ near my ear. Or if I hallucinate the whole thing. But I heard the buzzing sound for awhile. I just stood there trying to swat away this imaginary fly.

Certain sounds just freak me out in general. It takes a couple seconds for me to know if it's real, or if I'm just hearing things."
BPD,fkldzwu,t3_fj4mqp,1584304280.0,"See a psychiatrist. BPD is more than just what you're listing. There is also a borderline psychotic part to it as well. (Hence the name borderline). 


Many people have anxiety/depression. They also might have insecurities. This is common to go through.

That's not BPD though. Well, it is and it isn't. In most cases, BPD comes from a pretty messed up and traumatic childhood. It's not the root cause in all cases. But it is a common factor for most people. Our brains are also wired differently. And it can also be from of our genetics. So a close family member (parent) might suffer from a mental illness.

Keep in mind that even depression and anxiety can have other symptoms that might mimic another mental disorder. They are all comorbid, especially with BPD.

But please see a psychiatrist if you really want to know."
bipolar2,fkkip2w,t3_fiw0ld,1584284918.0,"You dyont have to go into detail of you do not want too. But I do think it's important to be as honest as possible with your therapist. 

Sometimes we do things that we cannot explain. And that's okay. It's a good idea to discuss these things now rather than later. You don't want to wait until you spiral out of control"
BPD,fkkhzzp,t3_fiymrl,1584284459.0,"Yes! Do you also dissociate more during this time? 

I live in an alternate reality a lot. During this time I dissociate more than usual. I'm just stuck in my head and it becomes hard to ground myself. Snapping out of it can be very difficult. This can last for months until I finally come back to reality. It's kind of scary."
BPD,fkh5rqn,t3_fib7dm,1584189570.0,Wow. I never put this together. But I def do this too. Sometimes I'll change my outfit more than once through out the day.
bipolar2,fkh5nb2,t3_figc76,1584189448.0,I just got Daylio. I'm giving it a try. I like it so far
bipolar2,fkh5khd,t3_figmcd,1584189368.0,"Dancing non-stop really clicked with me. And honestly most of this list. 

I usually get super irritable when I'm hypomanic. But I cannot control it at all. No breathing exercises would work. I also have trouble regulating any emotion (could just be BPD)."
bipolar2,fkh5aun,t3_fie99t,1584189100.0,"I honestly don't think anyone but my bf could ever love me.


Before I met my bf absolutely no one wanted to deal with me. Because I was just insane. My bfs just gets me and handles me well.

Like he doesn't give me shit if it's 4am and I'm having a complete melt down and he needs to calm me down. 

He doesn't care when my mood changes and I become restless and cannot keep still to save my life.

It's not easy to find someone like that. I hate that is hard for people like us to find someone. Most of us are actually really cool people. We just have this mental illness that can make it difficult to be in a relationship with."
BPD,fkh50yx,t3_figi3z,1584188813.0,Yes. I become OBSESSED for like 2 weeks and then I'm done.  Then it's on to the next one.
bipolar2,fkfym62,t1_fkfygbi,1584145639.0,"Everyone is different. It def helped with my anxiety, but that was about it.

Just keep monitoring yourself. I would write down things I thought was out of the ordinary. Or things that made me worse."
BPD,fkfxy8a,t3_fi5acq,1584145187.0,Literally all the meds do that to me too. I don't get it lol. But I'm not complaining
BorderlinePDisorder,fkfxt7f,t3_fhyd8r,1584145092.0,"I was on Zoloft, but taken off it. Now it's Abilify and Seroquel when needed."
BPD,fkfvjyj,t3_fhznn8,1584143557.0,"Listen to brand new the devil and God is raging inside if me album. All of it. Then go listen to their science fiction album. Especially songs 1,2,3 and 5. 

No song, music artist, or album had ever defined who I am as a person the way these 2 albums have."
BPD,fkfv9ko,t3_fi3thv,1584143359.0,"I have the opposite thing going on right now. I split in a CO worker a year ago. I just hated her. She caused so much anxiety and I refused to acknowledge her existence.


Cut to now and I'm OBSESSED with being her friend again. Like I switched back after going NC. 

I'm perplexed by this switch. It came out of no where."
BPD,fkfv1u0,t3_fhzd1m,1584143212.0,Yup. My mom is a major trigger for me. It's so bad that if I dream about her my entire day is ruined
BPD,fkfuwqa,t3_fi8j16,1584143116.0,"I'm positive I have precognition abilities. Especially with having dreams that come true. 


There are just too many things I've predicted. I know things I shouldn't."
