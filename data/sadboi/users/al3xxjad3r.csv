No that doesn't mean everyone who does it is cause theyre going through a lot and super depressed. I used to only do it because I was going through some tough shit and that's how I coped.

selfharm,fem4ia8,t3_epq7g5,1579239483.0,"Self harm is self harm. It doesn't matter the person's race gender sexuality whatever. To self harm you have to be feeling so bad you feel like physically harming yourself and putting yourself through sometimes A LOT of pain. If a man self harms he is absolutely NO LESS OF A MAN. It it's normal for men to have emotions. It's normal for men to struggle too. It's normal for some men to have mental illnesses. Never fucking shame someone that reaches out for help. If they tell you about their self harm and you laugh because they are a dude and you think it makes that guy look ""weak"" then you are an absolutely disgusting human being."

Usually parents just brush it off as teens being teens and invalidating our problems cause we're still kids and what not. I may not believe in God, but I think there is something out there. Personally, I believe there's got to be something after life. I believe in spirits and such, idk if you do or not but I do and it oddly comforts me. I feel like my grandma is still watching after her family. She loved butterflies so everytime I see one I can't help but to feel it's her, like the time one flew around my grandpa for a few minutes. I feel your son truly loves you and appreciates you and will always watch over you. He would be proud to see you listened to him and came here❤️"
SuicideWatch,fbwlzwf,t1_fbwis2u,1577153444.0,"Thank you. It really means a lot. It's just so hard like I've been in therapy for 4 years now, I've had at least 40 counselors and I stayed in a hospital for a little(which after the first day wasn't voluntarily but it's a long story) followed by ""intensive at home care"" where 4-5 counselors every single week came to my house to talk to me...it was awful. That lasted maybe a month or two, before I gave up entirely and told them straight to their faces I didn't think this is beneficial in any way and if anything it's stressing me out so much more and making me feel awful, annoyed, drained, and just tired. I've been on medication for the past 2 years and one of them is actually what caused my seizures. I'm on 3 medications currently, but I also need one for my recently diagnosed ADHD and for my trouble sleeping. It's constant trial and error and I mean if something ends up working then it's worth it but it's just a long wait. One of my medications is for stopping addictions and addictive tendencies, and yes when I tell people that they look at me weird. It's not just for drug/alcohol addictions, but also self harm, since that is an addiction too. That seems to be the only thing that's actually helped me in these past 2 years of experimenting. Idk I'm trying my best I really am, everything just continues to fall apart though. The only thing keeping me alive is my best friend, my few close friends, and my dog.

So much has happened in my life. I'm only 16 man I shouldn't have seen/experienced half the shit I have or continue to see/experience. It's just so difficult. My mom's side of the family is super religious and they have disowned me (they wouldn't let me sit at the table for the first Thanksgiving we've had together in 5 years. I had to sit alone in my half brothers room). They've disowned me because I don't believe in God anymore, I have blue hair, a few piercings, I'm transgender and I'm not straight. and my dad's side is full of drunks, druggies, they sleep around with everyone and they steal everything that isn't nailed to the floor... Unless they had a hammer then even that isn't safe. They're who I've looked to the most since my mom's side treat me so badly since birth with mental, emotional and some physical abuse. A little part of me has become like my dad's side. 

I don't know what to follow anymore. My friends are my best option at this point and we all steal, drink when possible, sometimes smoke, I get high every night, etc. I guess normal teen stuff. I'm afraid when I grow up my lack of guidance will really mess me up and ruin me"

SuicideWatch,fbwe5qk,t3_een9t8,1577147544.0,"I'm 16 and I've really been struggling my whole life. I have some various mental illnesses, I got into drugs for a while, and I've purposely almost OD'd multiple times. I've had health concerns involving 4 seizures and it's just been treated like it's unimportant. I really feel like I'm not important, but I try to tell people how important they are and how it gets better. I've saved multiple of my friends from commiting suicide on a many different occasions. I tell them things take time and it all gets better, but I don't even believe it for myself. Sometimes I feel no one but my best friend would care if I died, she'd get over it though.

To read something from someone on the other side dealing with the aftermath, I'm scared. My family would be fine, my friends would be fine. They'll get over it sooner or later. But my best friend would follow close behind me. I don't want to hurt them or anything... but sometimes it seems it's worth the sacrifice to stop this unending cycle of pain. 

I'm sorry about your son"

Drugs,fbtepyg,t3_eec9mi,1577076382.0,"Hey, I won't be able to help very much since I'm only 16 but my ex-bestfriend would definitely be able to relate to you a lot more. She's lived in a house basically full of pure abuse and drugs since she was born. I remember one time I didn't hear from her for an entire month, when she came back we hung out and got high and she opened up about where she was. She started hanging out with some really fucked people and she started snorting pills, taking hard drugs, and even did meth for a little. For her to come back and tell me everything she had done and been through it hurt so bad man I could've lost her so easily. One time I was over at her house and she crushed up a pill, looked at me and told me to ""never start this shit"" then walked to the next room because she was ashamed to let me see it, then came back.
But she got away. She got off the pills and cut off all of those people in her life and she's in such a better place now. She still lives in the abuse/drug house but she is strong and I know she can handle herself a lot better now than ever. She's lost so many friends and family to drugs, she's seen it first hand. She almost became one of them. But she didn't.

I actually snorted pills (hydro) during the month she disappeared. I never told her tho, I probably never will. I never told anyone. Within the past year I got into my dead grandma's pills. I come from a family of drug addicts, drunks, my cousins basically live in jail and when they're out they steal anything and everything. Its all I know. I steal and find myself taking pills I find, I get high every night (only by weed) and I'm overall a very clear product of my dad's side of the family. But my mom's side is full of christians, very insane Christians... so I know how to hide shit easily. My cousin's always stole my grandma's pills, she was on so many hard pain killers because of her health issues. I remember growing up I always was disgusted when my cousins stole her pills. But when she died that's exactly what I did. I got addicted to Ambien (a strong medication for insomnia) and it was a very strong dose. I completely melted my trashcan, I cut myself very deep on my arm(I already self harm but never have that deep on my arms), I burned myself on accident and on purpose, I smoked and snorted all I could find I nearly set my room on fire multiple times and I got very close to ODing a BUNCH of times. I was only a few pills off one time, I was so sick I had to stay home from school. I was in such a bad place for those few months. My sister had to dress me herself in the mornings and get me on the bus to go to school. I could literally do nothing for myself I was so fucked up from the time I took them to go to bed all the way until basically the next afternoon. I was drug tested at my school because I couldn't sign myself in I was so absolutely out of it I couldn't type. The only thing that saved my ass that day was the fact Ambien only shows up in blood tests, not urine. But I ran out of pills, and with no way to get more my addiction was forced to stop. Nobody knows any of this except my now best friend. And now everyone reading this. I'd like to say something about being in a better place now and that I've learned my lesson... But truth is, me being me along with my mental illnesses I know damn well if someone walked up to me right now and handed me a bottle of them id take them.


I don't know very much about actually being on heroin or loosing a close friend to it, but I know what it's like to be addicted and completely out of it. I know the pain of losing people close to me from various situations. So no, I don't know exactly how you're feeling, but I do feel like a part of me understands it. I'm sorry for your loss man, it's tough. But I know you got this. Addiction isn't a choice and it's not easy to break, but I know you're stronger than this. Take the loss of your friend as the push you needed all along. Take this as your wake-up call and change for the better.

Also, maybe just stick to weed😉😂"
