depression,fb9nqie,t1_fb9mqn4,1576643719.0,"Fear of rejection is a terrifying thing to everyone. So, don't worry you're not the only one who feels that way.

However, the only way to get over our fears is to face them. Try to develop a connection with other girls in general because focusing on one is such a HUGE risk.

How old are you? Do you have friends or a close friend? You should tell them how you feel. If you have dark thoughts or feel sad and tired all the time, talk to your family about it!"

depression,fb3mf0o,t1_fb2mglr,1576478497.0,"There is a chance she likes you back and is afraid to tell you herself. Imagine how happy the both of you could be right now if you told each other. The longer you wait, the more unsure you will feel...

Even if she had no feelings for you, it would hurt for some time but you would feel less and less stress each time you see her because you KNOW. Until then, you will be left in doubt, spending part of your life wondering whether you will ever have a chance and doubt hurts too.

Also, once you know the answer, either you will both be happy together or you will start noticing other girls whom you don't consider right now. Just know that there is more love around you than you notice. You've just got to allow yourself to receive it.

So, I encourage you to tell her! There is nothing to lose no matter the outcome : )"

My advice : you are not alone. As a woman, I like men who are able to express their emotions. You can start expressing all those emotions on the outside until you get fully comfortable and go ALL OUT!!

Wear a pink cardigan one day, paint your nails another day, let your hair grow long, then wear lipgloss another day, etc... you might even like that more than transitioning. You can also start following transgender people and get inspired by their story, how they started their journey. The longer you wait, the sadder you're going to feel.

Parenting is not only giving your kids food, clothes and shelter. Listening and making sure they know their emotions are nothing to be ashamed of is very important.

I was raised in a family where we had everything from the outside perspective but our feelings were neglected and this is still affecting my brothers."
depression,f86p9d2,t1_f858vu0,1574303642.0,"Small steps are important too. Keep pushing and try to initiate things more. Whether it's inviting a friend to do something, to hang out or talk to a stranger that you see often. Chances are they see you too and would like to know you. 

Get out of your comfort zone and open up to somebody about how you feel. It lifts so much weight off your shoulder!! You got this!<3

Also, if your sister can work, confront her about it because you can't have that responsibility forever."
depression,f857ya3,t1_f84j626,1574269556.0,"You might be waiting for your problems to go away or for a friend to magically appear in your life or you're waiting for a reason to get a job or for your life to end without killing yourself and without getting killed. Sometimes you wait for everyone to completely give up on you.

I used to feel those emotions until I had 0 financial support and had to go out and get a job or be homeless. My job took away the feeling of tiredness I always had then I bought a lot of things. From bed and mattress to laptop to tv to microwave to phone. I paid for my driving classes, etc... I mean I started my own life over and these goals I had set for myself kept me busy.

I have two close friends now and I never thought in a million years I was ever going to have a friend. I now feel so much better even though my whole life is not figured out yet.

I suggest setting goals for yourself and trying to accomplish them no matter how small."

Thinking that life is shit with a regular job is all in your head, it's not reality I promise. Please talk to someone about your thoughts and get professional help.

You will not stay in one place forever, you will improve, something new will appear, maybe an important somebody will come into your life once you quit your current job and get a new one. Maybe you will find a new hobby soon.

I don't have any college degree but I'm not hopeless. I started from fast food and the money I make is not enough to do EVERYTHING I like  but I'm in a slightly better job and the future is even brighter!! I will get there and I learn from every step I take.
