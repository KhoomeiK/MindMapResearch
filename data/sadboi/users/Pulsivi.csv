B) Fans of the Joker. There are a lot of fans of the movie that are just kind of unpleasant to be around, whether it be those who take the edgy approach and identify with the joker in all negative aspects and those who sympathize with a murderer (much like the true crime fandom). The movie wants us to sympathize with the character but we aren’t supposed to excuse him for his actions and some people (mainly on tumblr) don’t seem to understand that concept. 

To answer your second question, I mean people at large. I’m one of those people who wants everyone around to like me, even though that’s impossible to accomplish. I’m currently working on caring less about what others think, but that’s a very difficult thing to manage so I haven’t really come close to completing that goal.

C) I have some potentially unpopular opinions about hollywood. I think that ultimately actors are just people and we shouldn’t act like we know them personally and we sure as hell shouldn’t obsess over them because we find them attractive. Yet again you can find a lot of these people on tumblr. They say really creepy things about the actor they’re interested in, they write fanfictions, etc. That whole culture really bothers me because if you did those things with your next door neighbor, for example, it would immediately be seen as obsessive and creepy.
