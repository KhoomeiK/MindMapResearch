dating,fponozx,t1_fpomn0l,1588787560.0,We arent in a relationship. This is a girl I was trying to reconnect with.
dating,fpolwxf,t1_fpokr30,1588786701.0,We talked on the phone multiple times. Sometimes until late which was flattering because she usually is an early bird. But this was before the sudden drop in interest. And we talked about meeting up when I go home to visit and she was down.

dating,fpo6bv9,t1_fpo4aym,1588779140.0,"She works from home atm, but even when she was working she would still get back to me in a reasonable time frame. And she was slow to respond over the weekend too, when I knew she wasnt working"
dating_advice,fphprqk,t1_fphohn5,1588625571.0,"She does almost all the initiating because she usually falls asleep before I do, so she'll just hit me with a GM text after she wakes up the next day. On the rare occasion where I fall asleep first, I'll send her the GM text. And we've talked on the phone before, a couple of times til 2-3 in the morning. That was flattering because she said that she is never up that late. But that was also when she seemed to be super into me"

relationship_advice,etxs76o,t1_etxc17q,1563306196.0,"They weren't. She had her face in some of them. I just don't understand why someone would send pictures like that to someone they are bullying. Not saying you're wrong or that it wasnt the case, just feels odd"
