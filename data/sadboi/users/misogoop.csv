politics,fmyfs5c,t1_fmyf1j8,1586485127.0,"So we got married in December 2016 and I think we started the application in March of 2017 and I want to say we sent it off that spring I just forget which month. In I think June of 2017 she did biometrics and in August we had our interview. She got the “red card” before our interview and got her SSN and was able to get her drivers license. I don’t remember exactly when. The temporary Green Card was issued in October of 2017 and was good until October 2019. To apply for the permanent green card you have to wait until the 90 days immediately before the temporary one expires. So we applied August of 2019. They cashed the checks and sent a letter extending her status at the end of September of 2019. We got a letter in December about her having to redo her fingerprints and face scans and that was done this January. I was so hoping we’d just get the permanent card super fast, but now who knows. Then, once that happens, we can apply for citizenship immediately because we’ve been married longer than 2 years.

Edit: also if you do make a mistake on an application they totally send everything back in tact, tell you exactly what you did wrong, and give you a new date to have the corrected stuff in by, so don’t panic if you make a mistake! We were dumb and didn’t bring enough documents as proof like different utilities etc. and they counted the interview and gave us like a ridiculous amount of time to mail in the documents and we never had to talk to them or go in again.

We were super hopeful this would go as quickly as everything else because she had to go in for a second round of biometrics, but now COVID so who knows. That really sucks to hear you guys are being excluded from the CARE act. This administration infuriates me, I am constantly worried about immigration status. I wish you guys all the best.

I live in the USA now and always make plans for mini adventures close to home when we go back to visit every summer."
relationships,filzgdr,t1_filf7gn,1582514137.0,Now that I’m in my 30s I realized that straight people don’t think that they’re lesbians *sometimes* and worry about having to come out. Sometimes I feel like I have imposter syndrome about being lgbt and have to remind myself that I’ve always been gay...and that you don’t marry another woman if you’re straight. Haha

bipolar,fi4o27a,t3_f6cz6f,1582145060.0,"I had a therapist who did the same thing. Or would remark: “wow, you’re doing awesome for someone with your diagnosis.” 

Not helpful at all considering the literal anguish I sometimes go through to function."
BipolarSOs,fhtehkk,t3_f4ghvm,1581873658.0,"I’m bipolar 1 and I’m married. Our relationship is strong because she is well informed about my illness, I vocalize when I’m struggling, I make sure to validate her feelings about my behaviors when they negatively affect her and genuinely apologize and make an effort to rectify my wrongs, and what “seals the deal” for me being able to contribute to a strong and loving relationship is that I am 100% compliant with treatment and medication. The last part is how I can show her that I am serious about taking care of myself and taking care of US. Good luck to you and your SO! Just be open, honest, and show that you are doing everything you can to make sure this shitty mental illness is not a negative focal point in both your lives."

Christianity,fguw8y8,t1_fguw1jh,1581130826.0,I can provide sources if you’d like. You’re the one making things up.
Christianity,fguuu3e,t1_fguuj6f,1581129925.0,"Actually, ancient Hebrew translated to Greek, Latin and eventually English does miss quite a few things and people who actually study the Bible as an artifact of history discover more and more mistranslations as well as gospels that were thrown out by a pope.

Edit to add: you’re not making sense dude and you don’t know the text like you think you do.

Edit to add again: also, translations are also interpretations."
Christianity,fguthon,t1_fgutbq8,1581129072.0,"Again, Leviticus is mistranslated and the scripture in Romans, that says shameful acts...not a loving relationship. You don’t just get to mold what’s actually written to suit your own needs.

Edit: I’m fairly sure Leviticus is meant to be about pedophilia."
Christianity,fgurixo,t1_fgunjgt,1581127772.0,"They can’t. I’ve read the Bible multiple times due to religious schooling and there is nothing. The man lying with another man is a mistranslation and I think it was supposed to be man and boy. It’s stupid.

Edit: and the context in Lot is forcibly raping another man."
Christianity,fgurcuq,t1_fgumsnd,1581127658.0,"I don’t think you’re really in any position to tell anyone why it’s biblically correct or not. Please site scripture telling us that love is only between hetero couples. That the same love, but experienced by same sex couples, isn’t actually love because they are homosexual."
bipolar,fgukpg6,t1_fguki2v,1581123224.0,"Yeah reading things that resonate on Reddit format, not like a blog etc., helps me feel better quite often."
bipolar,fgujmon,t1_fguet5e,1581122440.0,Ugh yeah. I’ve been going through slight medicine adjustments over for like a year and I had a crying breakdown and had to have my wife take me home from work and I unfortunately had to tell my parents because I had to last minute cancel something and I had no time/energy to come up with something. My dad asking me if I’ve taken care of my “issue” like a week later was so uncomfortable.  My entire 20s was spent trying to figure out how to take care of myself (which I did a bad job of until I pretty much turned 30) with zero parental support. Boomers really are the worst.

Wellthatsucks,fgo3z8f,t1_fgnfd6l,1580959236.0,"We are Polish Catholics, but my mom is a history teacher and when I was little she became friends with a Polish, Jewish, holocaust survivor because she took the children to hear him speak so often. His children were kind of shitty so we would pick him up from the retirement and take him all around. He told me so much about his life and his time in a concentration/work camp. He burned his arm extremely severely with hot water doing something with potatoes (?) and he thought for sure they would find him and kill him because he couldn’t work (even in his old age the skin was totally mangled). He hid in his bunk and one day everyone was working and a nazi found him. He saw his arm, but instead of killing him, he hid him in his own barrack and gave him medicine and food. He hid him until the camps “death march” started and they were liberated by Americans during the march. Not everyone tangled up in evil is evil themselves."
