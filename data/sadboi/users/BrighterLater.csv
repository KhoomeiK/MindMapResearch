When they're rattling off personal stories, observations, facts, ideas that's probably someone who is in their head; I've spent most of life in my head and have only recently learned to be otherwise. Most people are in their heads. It feels a bit superficial but somehow polite and we're all used to it.

I'd tend to guess an AI presence would project this level of consciousness as well.

When a person is in their heart, it seems to me that it can just be FELT. Something in the eyes changes, something in the voice changes... time seems to change as well. It's as if you can really SEE them and you feel like you are seen as well. There's a vulnerability and an honesty and the best I can say is that, with practice both observing and BEING in our own hearts, the difference becomes obvious.

edit: similar to being in one's heart, I would say, is being in the moment. Our stories disappear and we just ""are."" I don't know if an AI would project this or not but somehow I doubt it."

I could go on and on with how that particular message rocked me, but what really hit me was, ""oh, ideas... ideas like these have gotten people killed."" 

So my question to myself is how to be a good steward of ideas. Are they of more utility when they are blasted out publicly and loudly in all directions, perhaps then shut down with the same force?

Not liking being lied to isn't evidence of shadow. It's okay to prefer that someone tells the truth. If, however, I flip out on them and throw a tantrum and go on and on about how I HATE liars, well... maybe that's a bit of my shadow, eh?

I feel that there are times to shift and push and practice free will and Creatorhood, and times to surrender and flow in humble and respectful acknowledgment of our ignorance. 

To be a little more personal about it, I've been pleasantly surprised by the universe or the Tao beyond my wildest imagination sometimes. Which is to say, I've learned that the ""me"" who wants to shift to another reality is very often limited in his perceptions of what's possible. Shifting to a reality that ""I"" imagine might suit me is limited to what I can imagine. So, instead I've surrendered in faith to the Tao to show me realities that far exceed what ""I"" (in my ignorance) can imagine... it's been way more more interesting to me."

But to sanctify it and almost, like, purify it with the energy of giving and of charity would be a good way to reframe the exercise.

Like, give it anonymously and quickly without thinking it's a big deal. 

I'm still wrestling with it, honestly. Because part of me is like, if I'm practicing breaking the illusion of money, then what does it say that I'm giving the illusion to someone else? Aren't I just deepening their illusion by giving away my own? So yea, that's why I think I'll try giving some away very casually and anonymously.

It doesn't all have to be figured out at once! 

My big breakthrough with depression was to take things in WAY smaller doses. To look at every ""problem"" I had all at once actually WAS impossible, and I could feel how impossible it was and it made me even more depressed. But the change, the difference that really helped, was to just do what I could with today. Maybe just brush my teeth, maybe just read a few pages of that book. Go easy on myself and let myself get a little stronger and open up. I swear it gets better! Just gotta practice being in the moment and take the past and future in small doses. Hope that helps.

If earth is a trap, of sorts... a prison, some gnostics say... what would be the state of being one would develop that would lead to liberation? ""Gnosis"" I know, but those moments of revelation would seem to lead to a certain attitude, if you will.

Some gnostics seem to detest incarnation, but it seems to me that hating one's own captivity doesn't create the energy for escape. Neither, perhaps, would ""learning to love it here.""

Maybe I'm wrong but I don't consider love to be the opposite of anything, you know? A friend was saying the other day how love and hate are opposite and so that's just more dualism... but I don't think so. I feel like love is just a constant. A state unto itself, I suppose.

The thing I'm seeking to understand about it is that when I connect more with the sense of freedom and break away more from fears and attachments, I actually see quite a bit of beauty in creation. Like in nature, trees, friendship, creativity, love, etc. So I'm not sure what to make of that.

It's got a lot of people talking on this sub (over 80 comments, wow!) and that's always a good thing. I feel questions and situations like yours are going to be so crucial if humans are to stop giving away their power to ""leaders"" and learn (or remember) their own divinity. 

At the very depth of it, any ""leader"" who fails to recognize that they are made of all the same star dust, atoms, and energy as their ""student"" will eventually fail the student, and themselves."

Shamanism,fnf8zvl,t1_fnehnnp,1586903619.0,"I've thought a lot about leadership in the spiritual community lately. Indeed, ""pushing"" doesn't seem like the right idea. Speaking of mud, shadow work, getting vulnerable, etc. I find it is really valuable. Actually it's been the best thing I can imagine, truthfully, and I never want to do it before, always glad I did it after. However, the guides and healers that I respect have encouraged me more than pushed me. 

Even in psychotherapy, exposure therapy is kinda the go-to thing. The therapist may support, encourage, coach, facilitate, etc... but if they push, I feel that robs the client of their agency and power. Now instead of courageously facing one's own shadow, the client has forfeited their courage to an authority figure. Not good.

I suppose the one caveat about it is that is IS valuable to learn who and what doesn't work for you. So there may be a lesson in this conflict in the same way that heartbreak can teach us about love and death can teach us about life."
todayilearned,fncmyrl,t1_fncbyu3,1586840986.0,"A common problem in conceptualizing reality is that our imaginations are limited (for the most part) by our daily lives and senses. When we think in time, we tend to think in terms of our own age and it's very difficult to conceptualizes geological time, for instance. 

We also think space travel as being about distance because we walk, fly, and drive in miles and kilometers. We tend to psychologically project our own lives (and limitations) onto our concept of alien life. That is, we assume WE are vastly intelligent and sophisticated (or warlike and self-destructive) and so if we can't figure it out then nobody else could. Classic hubris. 

I'm guessing there's alien life that would think of the very concept of distance or time as being kinda quaint and old-fashioned... and the idea of ""fucking themselves"" as being, well... alien."

Soulnexus,fnagwij,t1_fn9xnjk,1586797300.0,"From a less metaphysical and more psychological perspective, you can simply look at projections. 

You're having a great day and feel good inside. You might find yourself thinking, ""wow, what a nice town I live in.""

You're having a hard day and feel bad inside. You might find yourself thinking, ""this town is full of jerks.""

So, did the town change overnight? No, you did. Whatever is happening in our own mind and body, we project out onto our external experience. When we understand this mistake in perception, we can start to correct it to our advantage."
spirituality,fn3tugk,t3_fz1u25,1586627794.0,"There's a quote that is something like, ""Bliss is the prison of the mystic..."" from which I interpret that the unbelievable highs of spiritual moments actually become a problem for the spiritual seeker because they are forever chasing that high, forever disappointed in anything less.

How to combat this? By reflecting on novelty. We get bored when we see the things around us without the fresh eyes of novelty. The newness is gone. Spiritual moments are ""new"" and therefore so incredible... but the mystics and yogis who realize this practice something very important: forgetfulness. Haha, well not exactly... but they train themselves to let go of their knowledge, let go of their filters, unlearn all the ways of looking at the world that have become usual and boring to their minds. They don't seek things that are new to them, they seek for their very identities to be started aknw and actually learn to see the world again as if for the first time!

It can be done. I swear, and you can see this world again as if an infant. It's heaven here if we let go of our knowledge."

spirituality,fn0f69p,t1_fmysi3q,1586540817.0,"I agree, societies can't do the healing work for the individual. The individual must go within, do one's shadow work... and most societies are based on attaching our sense of ourselves to the external. 

However, I see society itself as being like an individual on a healing path. So, we ask, why do this path? Why go into shadow at all? Just to alleviate pain? To survive? Perhaps to some this is why. But to many on the path, it's because they have gotten a glimpse of what is possible (bliss, heart opening, etc). They have a sense or a vision of their divinity and this gives them the fortitude to face their shadow. 

So, I like the idea of a vision of our potential. Not to bypass our collective shadow, but to collectively develop a sense of why we'd bother doing the work :)

Edit: spelling"

energy_work,fm8zx3m,t1_fm0h33f,1585859105.0,"Sure. It's quite a topic and has been my primary area of experience and growth in the last several years. 

It basically comes down to polarity. Polarity creates attraction. Masculine and feminine being one such polarity system.

What it sounds like to me is that you've experienced immature and undeveloped forms of masculine energy and you (quite naturally) are not attracted to this. 

The mature, healthy form of masculine energy is that of GIVING. A man who knows what his gifts are and gives them with courage, solidity, and an open heart... that's actually what masculine energy is supposed to be all about. Sadly, our culture doesn't ask its men to surrender the ""taking"" energy of boyhood. So, there are a lot of adult boys who are still ""taking from mother"" in their energy. 

I'd be happy to recommend practical or esoteric things to look at if you want more info. But first off, does any of this sound accurate in your experience?"
