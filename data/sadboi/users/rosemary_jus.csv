The bacb just released an update relating to this virus and ethics, and one of my take aways was if services continue its because the risk of no services outweighs the risk possible exposure. Even then, I agree with the previous poster that some type of telehealth training plan can be put in place to help train the caregivers. The less people we have exposing themselves and others the faster we will get this virus under control. Follow your gut!"

Your body isn‚Äôt growing all the eggs and you‚Äôre not going back for blood draws super frequently, For FET you can either go the medicated or I medicated route. For me, my dr suggested the medicated route to be better able to control timing. This route only required 3 ultrasounds but I am taking 6 drugs. With unmedicated it‚Äôs more natural but I believe it requires more monitoring appointments to check lining etc. But I agree it‚Äôs more of a break than the full blown egg retrieval cycle.

The heat and massage really help. Good luck!"
sextherapist,fiw8aie,t3_f9rphh,1582777720.0,Can you make an appointment to see a therapist? A good one will help you figure out where they feelings might be coming from/ what they‚Äôre related to and how to work through them. Studies show our neuroplasticity is flexible enough to change even after long periods of having negative thought patterns so don‚Äôt give up. With the right therapist you can work through those feelings.

I was told also no heavy lifting or cardio that brings my bpm over 140 - something to do with no disrupting blood flow. I plan to just take the day off and go back to work as usual the following day and just take it easy. Are you doing a natural or medicated transfer if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?

IVF,fi7chaq,t3_f6sx3w,1582218701.0,"If you‚Äôre traveling have a cooler for the meds that should be refrigerated. I like the naula app to track medications. Def keep that hot water bottle handy for the PIO injections since those get sore (massage the area afterward to prevent knotting) An ice pack or use ice if you find the pinch or burn of the injections (mostly just menopur) to be annoying (I‚Äôm on my third cycle and found icing the area of injection helps with the initial pinch). I ordered these things called gummy drops; they are ginger anti nausea drops to help with any nausea - I had that a bit at one point. I‚Äôm also a big fan of the nuun electrolyte tabs you can put in water; my dr suggested drinking diluted Gatorade as I prepare for transfer but I don‚Äôt like the taste of Gatorade, and these tabs are only 15 calories too ! They add a nice, less artificial flavor to water. I found they helped with some headaches some of the meds were causing me, and possibly fatigue. I have a journal I planned to write in to document the journey; I didn‚Äôt do too much ‚Äújournaling‚Äù per say but it was helpful to have a place to keep track of updates and dr consult meeting info. They sell cute little ivf journals on amazon. A place to keep receipts, bills etc. would be smart to have if you plan to write off medical expenses on your taxes. I‚Äôve seen some people purchase one of those like drawer organizers to separate all the meds if you‚Äôre someone that likes to be organized and have a place for everything,  I personally didn‚Äôt do that but I think it would have looked nicer than having all the bulk of the boxes kept in a stack in my office. In terms of mentally - accupuncture has been helpful and I actually now see a dr that recommends it 1x a week. Honestly just taking it a day at a time, filling yourself with as many healthy distractions as possible is the best thing. For me I‚Äôm trying to just ride the ups and downs as they come. Have a support system whether it‚Äôs a Facebook group or a friend who has also done this, or even one of those fertility mentors in fruitful fertility could be helpful. Not being afraid to ask questions is important because the docs and nurses do this so often, and there‚Äôs so much info it‚Äôs easy to miss some info or feel like things need clarifying. Best of luck!! Hang in there! Fingers crossed this is a short road for you!"
