bipolar,fneg9zh,t3_g0cdxa,1586888838.0,"So i am on carbamazepine 200mg, seroquel 50mg(which helps me sleep and pull down hypomania) and 54mg of concerta(amphetamine abuse and personally dont want to be prescribed to adderall i like it too much). I am rapid cycle. Manic usually only last a week at most. My cycles are still happening and i would like to know what i can consult with my dr about changing. The tegratol worked at the start. It helped me have more control over explosive and elongated periods of anger. But i think the anger may have only been a symptom of a long mixed episode ate the time. I have an okay mood 3 days in a row then it gets mixy for a few days or a solid up or down. I know yall arent doctors well some may be but does anyone have a suggestion on a mood stabilizer or antipsych i can talk with my dr about going to. I do not recieve anti depressants well or ssri's."

CoronaNC,flxybnq,t1_flxtkbk,1585592134.0,Yeah mine did too. Your employer has 10 business days by law to reply to the notice and if unemployment never gets in contact after that 10 days it goes through automatically. This whole process was frustrating but why stress what ya cant change.
CoronaNC,flxm0px,t1_flx8r4p,1585585503.0,Yeah no problem
CoronaNC,flwgqy2,t1_flibba3,1585550091.0,It takes 2 weeks to get that thing cleared. Just give it time. They have put a lot more info online now. I was in the same boat. I filed on the 18th and it just got cleared out this weekend. Keep doing your weekly verification. Your first check should be 2 weeks worth but dont quote me on that.

bipolar,fk36x24,t1_fk35sck,1583819939.0,Thank you ive been where you are too. I dont really pray but i respect that word for what it is. Ive been paranoid about my job for no reason too. That is why im afraid to go back to school i know i can do in 60% of my cycles and that is barely winnning. Im gonna spend some time in meditation or at least the closest i can get to that and ill put forth that idea that this might be manageable

BDSMcommunity,fitog2o,t3_f9ss2z,1582725663.0,Her not being satisfied until i call her babygirl is a big one. When she is just argumentative about nothing and starts getting bratty i know she needs attention and to hear a stern tone in my voice. Certain outfits and activities will put me right into it cause i know she is in little space. Really all she has to do is say Daddy and i am there.

AmItheAsshole,f71weuh,t3_dtxxvv,1573349537.0,My dad bout did the same thing to me expect it was just pot after beating the fuck outta me and taking me to the police station for a nickle bag of weed. Then drug tested me at his discrection from 16- 18. When i moved out after at 18 i started doing everything i could get my hands on. Spent my 20s doing meth and drinking heavily. Educate and rehabilitate. Pot isnt the worste thing in the world at that age yes it is damaging to mental development. She is reaching out for attention and an escape from a torn family life. Therapy would do you both some good and dont force it let her go on her own freewill suggest it and let her chose it for herself. Now she jas a criminal record for manucturing and god knows what else the court system is gonna run her through the ringer and drain you of money. And yeah she resents the fuck out of you get ready for backlash. EDUCATE YOUR CHILD ON THE DANGERS OF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. Dont use bullshit scare tactics. Have open and honest communication if they are afraid to talk to you they are going to go to friends for advice.

Stomach is all tore up, equilibrium is off, headaches that come and go, groggy(I know that gets better). Seroquel as much of a pain in the ass it is is helps I've been on it by itself before. But will these side effects ease up or should I talk with the dr. about something different.  I have an appointment next week already scheduled."
