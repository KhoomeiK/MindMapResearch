The fact they are a hoist transfer means they more than likely cannot do much for themselves. More often than not chairs need repositioning, beds need moving and other stuff like that, so a minimum of 2 people is needed.

From the time stamps on my photos, we got to the glacier (the first sightseeing stop) at around 11am, then the last stop (Seljalandfoss) at just around 15:00. So technically there should be enough daylight but it just depends on the day & the weather I guess!

There wasn't a massive amount of time at either stop to do a lot of walking, however there is plenty of time to see the sights and get plenty of photographs.
