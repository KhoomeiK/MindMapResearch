Girl *same.*  My state just opened restaurants and salons ""at 25% capacity"" and if you drive by those places, they're completely packed.  Most staff in restaurants aren't wearing any kind of protective gear either.  Even just going to the grocery store there's probably only 40% of people in masks.  Hell, the governor was even recorded saying there will be a massive spike in cases when everything reopens.  At least mandating masks would *help.*

I work in a doctor's office and we're basically still on lock down because we can't be responsible for an asymptomatic carrier coming in and infecting other people.  A guy asked me today if I think there will be a second wave and he seemed surprised that I said absofuckinglutely (but professionally of course lol.)  I told him there's going to be a second wave within a month, not September or November like he was inclined to believe.

If she's not listening very well, try upping the ante with better treats.  You want something that she goes bonkers for like little bits of chicken, freeze dried liver, or some other stinky treat.

I also think it might be a good idea for you to sort through some of the tags and read posts by top of all time.  It's good to read about other's experiences before you get there just so you have an idea what you're getting into.  I, myself, came here to read through the Puppy Blues section because I definitely had them this morning.  I'm feeling a little better now knowing that it's all temporary, but I feel a little more prepared for what's to come as well.  I also went through some of the wiki videos and made notes with step by step directions of how to train certain things that I wasn't so sure about.
