depression,fgrue4w,t3_ewq43t,1581057938.0,"I adopted a kid as a single guy. I don’t believe in God, but let me tell you..,,.. there is no way I would be here or be alive if it wasn’t for my son I adopted. I would have been dead a long time ago.  Sometimes I think God made sure I would be okay by bringing my son into my life. 

Sometime I think I made a mistake adopting, but that is just the depression talking.

I love my boy so much, but this pain is unbearable. I can’t want for him to grow up so I can be done with this horrible place."
Needafriend,fgru1m9,t3_f0351m,1581057573.0,I’m a gay guy and I feel that way about gay men too. It’s all about sex and nothing else. I have just given up.
depression,fgrtbv9,t3_ezx7tp,1581056828.0,Totally same. Gave up a few years ago.

therapists,fejbs1s,t3_epa9r7,1579166064.0,"Exactly- if it’s about them abs something they need go for it. If it’s about you and isn’t relevant to their life, let it go."

TrueOffMyChest,f1ri6vr,t3_dafueq,1569715957.0,There is no way your college professor said being a police officer is racist. There is no way she actually said that.  Quote her if that’s true.
TrueOffMyChest,f1rebuu,t1_f1rdyru,1569714639.0,What are some of the ideas she shares that you think are not fair?
TrueOffMyChest,f1rd3cs,t3_dafueq,1569714170.0,"As a therapist, and as a man, the fact that you put white privilege in quotation marks and refer to adult women as “girls” says a lot about you."
TrueOffMyChest,f1rcq6w,t3_dafueq,1569714026.0,"If you really failed a class  because you didn’t agree with a professor, then complain to the dean.

Young people that you interact with are learning who they are. Some might swing one way before they figure it out. 

Just because “girls” smack talk you, it doesn’t mean that woman won’t like you.

I’m man, just in case."
legaladvice,f1odemv,t3_da580t,1569641655.0,Wow! I just can’t imagine how that feels. I’m so sorry that happened.
therapists,f1od6ot,t3_daao1k,1569641446.0,"I am an LMFT and have been for 15 years or so. 
First, learn a little about play therapy If you’re going to be working with kids. 

Second, you should have a supervisor. This would be great to share with him or her."
TrueOffMyChest,f14q35r,t3_d7k6p5,1569179057.0,"I am a therapist, and a deal with similar issues. 

Show the angry girl unconditional positive regard. She feels safe enough to be angry with you. She probably has a lot of things to feel angry about. 

The nicer you are to her, the more angry she will be. She is in pain. Just be present with her. Don’t worry so much about changing her. 

You will never know this, but sometimes just being present and not reactive is what someone needs. 

She may have severe attachment injury and may actually really like you but doesn’t want that relationship to hurt her like so many have before, so she pushes you away. 

Let her push, and just stay present. Once she sees you’re not reactive and you aren’t going away, she will calm down.

And btw, I used to be a teacher too. Thanks for giving a shit about your kids and wanting to help. 
I wouldn’t be a therapist today if it weren’t for the teachers that believed in me.
