Anxiety,fo7zhln,t3_g5zaev,1587587224.0,"Hmmm well for me I‚Äôve always been an on and off smoker then about 5-6 years ago I went into a serious depressive / anxious phase which was fuelled by a serious health anxiety issue I couldn‚Äôt even sneeze without thinking something absolutely horrifying was happening to me I was a wreck and during that I didn‚Äôt smoke so I ended up losing my job due to my anxiety and stayed in bed for three weeks smoking ridiculous amounts and it helped it helped ease all anxieties and worries I actually left the house , started going gym etc ... but I smoked all the time like all the time and it did help but about 8 months ago something awful happened in my life and every time I would even have two puffs of a joint my heart would start racing , panic attacks would happen so I obviously had to quit and once I got over the 3 weeks of sweating so much at night I had to buy a new mattress (btw be prepared by matter protectors etc if your gonna quit) I felt more confident and outgoing than I did when I was smoking it all the time but saying that it helped me massively through a serious depressive stage of my life I don‚Äôt think i would of got through it without weed but it was only a short term option . But now I smoke again but now I‚Äôve got my head clear I enjoy smoking and it‚Äôs not stunting me as I‚Äôve gone back to it once I got a grip of my mental health and I‚Äôm in a good place ... so it all depends if you use it to help with your problem or just use it to mask your problem if that makes sense xxx anyway sending you well wishes in whatever your facing now and everything works out in the end x PS sorry for spelling mistakes etc on phone and the screen slightly cracked my friends x"

Anxiety,ff8lyf5,t1_ff8lu1h,1579685045.0,"I have evil health anxiety but I find the only way I can make myself feel better and bare with me I‚Äôm gonna sound like a weirdo but just think there is people out there that abuse there bodies on a daily basis 365 days a year look at crackheads and meth heads they live forever haha , us health anxiety guys tend to treat our bodies as temples apart from the worrying makes us sick because it does cause physical symptoms that our powerful minds create ... honestly just try and think that next time and take deep breaths and try to be rational ... I honestly hope I can take my own advice one day lol ... hope you have a great day xxx"
