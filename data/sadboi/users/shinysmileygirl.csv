AskWomen,fq7yfch,t3_ggyq94,1589154770.0,"I‚Äôm currently only a step above rock bottom. But I‚Äôll share, if that‚Äôs okay. 

For the last 2 years my mental health was really declining. I was married to a good man, who sadly just didn‚Äôt understand me. We just weren‚Äôt compatible. I was working a job that took advantage of me and was a really toxic environment. I was living 3 hours from my family. I was having breakdowns constantly. Some worse than others. I‚Äôd be crying before work and after. Considering seriously injuring myself so I wouldn‚Äôt have to work for a bit. I was so stressed and anxious and depressed. I tried to make things work. I really tried. Medications helped for a little while, but then I got even worse. Finally said enough is enough and got myself out of the situation. 

I‚Äôve been living back at home now for just over a month. It was really rough at first. Especially with this lockdown crap. I felt more lost than ever. Was seriously plotting to kill myself for a bit there at first. 

But I just took it one day at a time. I was walking to and from work until last week when I bought a beater car. I think the exercise helped a lot actually. Just forcing myself to be active. At first that was all I could do, but then I starting taking the dogs for walks too. And getting out in the yard, weeding and digging out new garden beds. Getting my room set up the way I like it. Planning fun activities with my siblings. Keeping busy. Not thinking too much long term plans. Just getting back to doing things I enjoy. 

So for anyone just starting to pull themselves up from rock bottom, I‚Äôd say find a safe place to build yourself back up. Surround yourself with supportive people. Try to keep busy. Don‚Äôt ask to much of yourself. Just try to do little things that feed your soul, and cut out anything that‚Äôs sucking your soul. I think metal health and stability comes first at this point."
AskWomen,fq7wdei,t1_fq5o9sd,1589153565.0,"This gives me a lot of hope. I‚Äôm in the same boat right now. I moved back home a month ago. Not in with my parents, but in with siblings.

But I‚Äôm starting to feel my stress slip away. Really glad I made the decision to move home. I think things will continue looking up from here."

How are you using your cumin? Whole seeds, lightly toasted in a pan and then ground. It‚Äôs game changing. I use my cast iron pan on medium heat. Stir constantly. It only takes 15-30 seconds max. Dump them out of the pan immediately when they turn reddish brown and fragrant, otherwise they‚Äôll burn. I also treat coriander seeds the same way. They usually take slightly longer to toast. 

I use a lot of fresh garlic, fresh ginger and fresh lemongrass to season dishes. Basil, parsley, thyme and oregano are also best fresh imo. I like to roast veggies with tons of garlic, plus salt and pepper. And then finish it off with balsamic vinegar and sometimes a little honey. Carrots, Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes are all very good this way. Bet broccoli would be as well. Fresh basil and garlic is my favorite addition to saut√©ed zucchini.

Faces,fodkycv,t3_g4xh58,1587685975.0,"I‚Äôll add my 2 cents. First, I really do like this sub. Only a few small things that I‚Äôd change. But if the majority disagree, I can definitely put up with them!


1. Low quality images. Most phones are capable of taking great pictures now. I wish people would pay more attention to good lighting and focus in their pictures. It‚Äôs not hard. I sometimes think low quality photos are purposeful. To diminish visibility of flaws, or as an aesthetic thing. I don‚Äôt know, but I don‚Äôt care for it. I want to stop scrolling and feel struck with a connection to the face. Low quality photos disrupt the ability to feel that. 

2. I don‚Äôt love the really blatant filters. I feel it takes away from the focus. 

3. Masks. Another thing that takes away from the experience of viewing a face. Why are mask selfies even here? It feels like pandering tbh. Everyone‚Äôs looking for that sweet covid karma. I just want to see faces. 

4. Half the face cut off. Obviously kind of defeats the purpose of the sub. It seems like a no brainer that the face should be fully in frame, or at least 80-90% of it. 

Basically, what the rules state. ‚ÄúMake sure that the focus of the pictures is the face.‚Äù It is my opinion that photo quality factors into that, as do filters. Masks absolutely distract the focus and literally cover half the face. And cutting off part of the face makes no sense either. 

Overall though, I‚Äôd say the sub has quality content. And if majority of the users have no issues with my 4 points above, I can put up with a little that I don‚Äôt care for. It‚Äôs not overwhelming by any means.

Oh, editing to add one more thing. I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing more photos that aren‚Äôt selfies. High quality photos of other people that the user finds striking in some way. Not sure if we‚Äôd post with credit to the photographer or model what. Just an idea."

And I still think maybe that‚Äôs all I need. If my lungs looked fine just a few months ago, I don‚Äôt know how it could be medical. I‚Äôm hoping just to find anyone who maybe struggled with lung pain and has any tips for getting past it.

Androgynoushotties,fodesxg,t3_g6thuf,1587683792.0,"I had high hopes for this sub being a place for images of attractive androgynous people. Instead it seems to be a lot of low quality selfies of arguably average looks. 

And a lot of trans/non-binary folk, who do not look, or even attempt to present an androgynous appearance. I‚Äôm so confused by that. A mtf person presenting in a feminine manner is not androgynous, even if they have a somewhat masculine bone structure. There are subs for selfies and subs for trans people and subs for trans selfies. I‚Äôd be fine with trans selfies here, if they‚Äôre attractive, androgynous trans selfies. Sometimes they are! And I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But androgyny has a definition, and a lot of people here simply do not fit it. There‚Äôs cis selfies on here that don‚Äôt belong too. But cmon, feminine mtf people should know full well they‚Äôre too feminine for this sub! They‚Äôve gone through the transition, made their way along the spectrum from masc to fem. They should know full well where they sit on that spectrum, and it‚Äôs not in the middle. Sorry, rant over. 

Point is, quality is seriously lacking here. And now it‚Äôs more and more nudes. Ugh. There are subs for that too! How about an AndrogynousGoneWild sub? Why can‚Äôt we just have a place for sfw photos of above average attractiveness, and truly androgynous looks?

germany,fo6ttc4,t1_fo61m44,1587566600.0,"It sounds like there‚Äôs a lot of different versions. Somewhere down the line someone tweaked it a bit, thinking it was funnier that way, I suppose."
germany,fo6tktx,t1_fo62q3n,1587566473.0,"Interesting! That translation would definitely make sense! From what I can gather, there are a lot of versions floating around. People altering them and changing the meaning or implied meaning for their own entertainment. One of those rhymes that morphs and evolves."
germany,fo6t25a,t1_fo5ym6y,1587566191.0,I like this version best! Makes a little more sense and definitely sounds rolls off the tongue better.

germany,fo5ltzf,t3_g5ug17,1587528872.0,"I can‚Äôt seem to find anything online. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs at all common in Germany, and where it comes from. Or if my family just made it up themselves. 

My dad would say this when I was a kid, and I think his dad said it to him. It was told to me as kind of a German version of ‚ÄúGood night, sleep tight. Don‚Äôt let the bedbugs bite.‚Äù Only it‚Äôs basically saying don‚Äôt poop the bed lol. 

My Opa immigrated from Germany when he was a teenager. From Leverkusen. Would‚Äôve been like 60 years ago."

Facial features vary on everyone. Your ears are definitely not a dealbreaker. You‚Äôre good looking, and if you have a good personality to match, you‚Äôll do well in life."
