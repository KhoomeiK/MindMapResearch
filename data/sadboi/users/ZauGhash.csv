I learned pretty quickly I don‚Äôt need booze to socialize, I sleep better, I can pay attention better with essentially everything, I‚Äôm more conscious about eating healthier, money issues aren‚Äôt as bad, and have made more meaningful relationships. I‚Äôve also booted out people in my life who were straight toxic. Saying no to alcohol has helped me to also say no to other people and things in my life that were holding me back. Drinking imo isn‚Äôt worth it, it‚Äôs literally poison."

I also just don‚Äôt really get it either, when I was that age I just wanted to play my Nintendo 64 and go climb trees and stuff with my friends. Didn‚Äôt know a single person in school either at that age who wanted to do a sex change. Things really have changed.

depression,fbfjvel,t3_eczhm3,1576812367.0,"Your family is selfish for saying you‚Äôll ‚Äúruin Christmas‚Äù by supporting a friend who most likely needs your company now more than ever. 

Go with your gut instinct and be with your friend. Christmas comes every year and most people blow it up out of proportion making it something more ‚Äúmagical‚Äù than it really is. So what if you miss out on one day? There‚Äôs always next year. The real magic imo would be you supporting your friend. 

I‚Äôve overdosed before, had no one by my side when it happened when I was at my lowest and let me tell you, it hurt ALOT, and still does. I wish the best for you and your friend."

SatanicTemple_Reddit,f937zr9,t1_f937cbt,1575052204.0,"It is petty and immature thats for sure. 

I can relate somewhat, I'm a proud Satanist and when I posted on social media just expressing my happiness (and not pushing my beliefs on anyone) as being a part of TST, I received immediate backlash from people I thought were my true ""friends"" and actually they were the ones who then pushed their Islamic and Christian beliefs ON ME for doing so! It was very hypocritical but also enlightening and eye opening. A lot of people unfollowed me and de-friended me. 

I understand family is a different matter, keep true to yourself, try and not let it get to you too much. Try and have a civil sit down conversation with your sister; not on the matter of you being a Satanist, but how it affected you bringing your Mom into the equation. It could help, just my two cents though."
SatanicTemple_Reddit,f9374cv,t3_e3h2ng,1575051576.0,"Personally, I feel no obligation to explain myself to others, including family when it comes to my own beliefs but I do understand where you're coming from. 

I'm sorry your sister feels that way, unfortunately a lot of people are so set in their ways and their own beliefs they ignorantly refuse to think outside their own little boxed in worlds. Hopefully your sister will come around in the near future and at least be accepting of your own choice and belief in this matter. Give it some time, she's probably just shocked and regardless if she's never expressed any religious sentiment, just hearing ""Satan"" invokes negative images for many people based on what they have been exposed to all their lives including religion, entertainment, and the likes. 

I wish you best of luck, stand your ground and be proud of who you are, I know I sure as hell am! Hail Satan!"
