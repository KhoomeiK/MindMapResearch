teaching,fr133rx,t3_glysxf,1589812318.0,"First, you need to make your rubrics so that there is a ‘try factor’ grade. In my rubrics not plagiarizing and turning something in is either a 50 or 65. If it’s on topic somewhat it is a 65. I teach in high poverty areas and tbh expect my kids to do a LOT of work. A kid working and everything else is not going to be able to make up every assignment, and an ‘earned’ grade might kill them AND their motivation. Secondly, when you review your grades at the end of the quarter/grading period, mathematically what is the difference between a 65 and 70? A few homework’s, one or two test questions? Go on and move that. If the child has circumstances, I will move it from a 60 possibly. 

ONE TIME I have a child a grade he completely didn’t earn. He was an amazing child, very respectful, and a senior. He was also the oldest child, but did have married parents. The last semester (I think end of Q3) his mother suddenly died. As in dropped dead. Said she wasn’t feeling well, went to lay down, and died. He didn’t show for the test/final project (OBVIOUSLY!) but I think I had his notes, so I excused it. The final semester he wasn’t there. I mean, he showed up sometimes, but he wasn’t there. He was out for the funeral, professional counseling, and sometimes he just went to his JROTC coach. I couldn’t fail him. I spoke to his other teachers, which was just math really. He was already good at it, but did suffer. She helped him along. The thing is English does require a different level of thinking than math. He couldn’t focus on the text (reading or video). His coach told me to do what I thought was necessary, but I couldn’t do it to him.  I averaged his previous quarters grades and boosted his final quarter to that, from like a 50. 

Otherwise, I have moved students experiencing homelessness grades, mostly by removing more 0s. I think it is extremely important to consider the whole child when we review the grades. I rationalize this because we are humans, and most rubrics are subjective. I think perhaps I would think differently if I were in young grades, but high school is a different beast."
