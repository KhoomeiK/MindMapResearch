Everything that happens to other people, is suddenly something bad that happened to her. And she's way too soft on Mateo. Raf wants to be more tough but Jane won't let him. And having two different parenting techniques isn't quite the best way to handle things. Especially the thundercloud/sun technique was a bloody joke man. Not saying that the twins are such wonderful children, they obviously mimic their mothers behaviour. Though Petra at least disciplines them, and they get a punishment. They're different punishments, more material in a way, but they seem to be rather effective."
