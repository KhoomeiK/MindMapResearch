You shouldn’t have to apologize to him for being good at something you worked hard towards. If you practiced a different hobby (say dancing) and you out danced him at the club, would you have to apologize to him after you outshined him at dancing? This is ridiculous. NTA"

AsianParentStories,ezq3sdi,t3_d1tqwz,1568054427.0,"Hang in there OP. I feel your pain. I know how hard it is to create art when you're depressed, and I know how it feels to think about death throughout the day like how people think about what they'll eat for their next meal. 

1.First, I would get therapy.. I'm sure school could provide one or there are counseling sessions that's covered by insurance, (I'd also try to get diagnosed and  a prescription for ADHD medication if that's a big issue)

2. Be with friends that motivate you, motivate you to create and do better with your life. I have also felt the hopelessness and despair, but my friends have been through thick and thin with me, pushing me along the way. Some times all you need is someone to talk things out and share a new perspective.

3 I'd gather all your important travel documents and a burner phone (if you want to NC eventually.. thats your choice). (if you're financially dependent.. I'd start saving money) to move away. I know you feel like you can't live without them.. but I promise you once you are away from her and you begin to fill your life with things that satisfy your soul, you'll be much better off.  

You've been brainwashed into believing that you can't do anything without her. You've been living your life trying to meet her needs and satisfy her, when the truth is ; you never will. 

Do what makes you happy. but start to build your foundation to get away. first. I'm sure you are more capable than what you give yourself credit for.

Try everything in your power to get away.. but please please please, don't hurt yourself."
CasualConversation,ezgv2wq,t3_d0zrzh,1567901865.0,hmm...I remember in second grade we watched ducks hatch... and the teacher would ask to see if anyone wanted to take the ducks as pets... this is going to sound weird.. but maybe see if an elementary school is giving them away.. or Craigslist! they usually have people trying to sell animals or need to give away their animals...

AsianParentStories,ez8iadu,t1_ez85dgr,1567744303.0,I agree with the first comment.. from what my parents tell me.. traditionally the parents live with the elder son (and his wife take care of the mother/father) and the daughter(s) are considered apart of the husband's family.. and not their original family  :/

AsianParentStories,eywbgru,t1_eyw2vsc,1567525548.0,Well.. i was going to report fraud on the account since she moved the money. But she has a family.. like a kid and another one on the way.
AsianParentStories,eyuimhi,t3_cxvxfu,1567463145.0,"I've been in debt for about over a year now. Some things happened between me and a family member that I thought I was close to. (She works in the banking industry and stole my information and showed it to my parents– my   
 banking statements and the like). She also told them that I took money from her and told them about my black bf (31) (hes very nice, accomplished and is a loving father to 3 children, but never been married) 

She did all these things out of malice, when I explained to her that the money was my own money that was mixed in with her's. (She had me open an account and hold money for her for a few years, because she's hiding all this money from her hubby) 

So since my parents found out about my financial situation and my BF, they've been calling me non stop at every hour of the day, telling me to break up with him and calling him a possible murderer. My mom called me to ask me why I'd let my self be with someone of ""low class"", and why I ""cheapen"" myself. They keep questioning me about what I did with my money and why I spent so much. (the truth is that I used it on learning/schooling and some investing that didn't pan out I also lost my job a few times and didn't have the heart to tell them afraid they would ridicule me) It has been giving me so much anxiety that I sit at work just scared and unable to focus. I'm currently living somewhere 6-8 hours away from home for 2 months, but I have to eventually go back after the job is done. My father flew in from China this past weekend and is calling me during work hours, early in the morning and in the middle of the night. I'm having a hard time sleeping each day.  I've been thinking of cutting them off completely, changing my bank accounts and changing my phone number and not telling them where I'm going.  As of now, I put my phone on silent. 

I want to disappear from them but I'm afraid that they'll come and look for me. My father has things he put under my name (I dont know what exactly) but i'm sure he wouldn't want me walking away with his stuff. I think he's moving under the guise of a worried parent to get me back, so that all his stuff is secure. My family is generally well off because of him, and everyone usually bends to his will because he has money. My mom used me as a cash cow since young. Growing up she'd tell me that I needed to take care of her when she gets old, however, my older brother on the other hand had no responsibilities of that sort (he didn't even have to go through college+ he can come and go as he pleases) 

At this point in time, I just feel depressed and suicidal. I want to tell them that, but I don't want them coming near me.  I'm sure they think that I met a black man that has ""corrupted"" me and he's probably syphoning money off me; when that couldn't be farther from the truth. I've called my best friend and told her of the situation and she's offered me to stay at her place for a while. My BF on the other hand is about to sign a once in a life time record deal with a big label. We talk every night and he tells me that hes ready to take care of me and eventually get married. I really don't want to talk to my parents or see them, because I know they'll start yelling at me with racially charged comments and ask about money. When I cut them off, should I even tell them that I'm cutting them off or should I just disappear?"
AsianParentStories,eyucphg,t3_bbe0bu,1567458685.0,"wow, I'm actually going through the same thing. Do not give in. You have a great job, you have a great BF and a place of your own. Your foundation is already laid out for your future. Don't throw away all that you've built  just to bend to your parent's will. This is going to sound mean but you will never satisfy their needs or expectations. Each time you reach a finish line they always move it further away. 

Thank you for sharing your story and I hope you stay strong and stand your ground. Your parents may have taken care of you and all but you need to be happy too; and living like that under their thumb is killing you. Plus what's the worse they can do to you? hit you? kill you? I know that you feel scared because of the years of emotional abuse they put you through, making you feel that you can't live without them if you don't listen or do what they tell you. But please please please, change your banks account and everything they have access to. Change your phone number if you have to (you can buy pre paid sims cards) 

If anything this might sound weird, but you have the power. The way they micromanage you and are on your ass about every little thing in your life, means that you have something they need or want from you. So don't feel bad for cutting them off. Just don't let them get to you and put your mental health first."
