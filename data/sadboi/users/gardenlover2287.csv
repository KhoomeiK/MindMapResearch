I’m a pretty laid back lady and I’ve had a hard time staying friends with women because for the most part they are princesses. I actually have an easier time relating to men because they are straight forward and don’t get all emotional for no reason. My biggest issue with women is they always want to compete with me and I assume they do this to each other. Anyways this is a bigger conversation it can’t be put into a paragraph. 

I sounds like you’ve just ran into the wrong type of women. Don’t be angry at us as a whole it’s not fair to you and us. Also, don’t stop being who you are you seem like a great guy 💚"
