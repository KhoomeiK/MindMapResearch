DotA2,fo1srjt,t1_fo1s7sr,1587440656.0,"The thing is, I need a little more mmr to reach divine, like 100 mmr. I noticed and I am not the only one, that at this rank there are so many boosted or boosters, it's like every 2 game you come across one of these 2. Maybe my behaviour plays into that too so I don't know for sure. Again, I am not toxic, but really it's really easy to spot a boosted/acc buyer player. So it's kinda hard to enjoy most of the games. But there are some really good games from time to time. But getting reported and trash talked by a boosted player while you actually try to calm him down, which happens often. Like a week ago I got low prio and after getting out and after 3 ranked games low prio again. This is outrageous. I flame from time to time when all the anger builds up, but I sincerely am a player that tries to calm his teammates knowing that flaming does no good, but it gets the situation worse."
DotA2,fo1r5y8,t1_fo1o5hx,1587439578.0,Well I am 4.5 k but ty for the advice. I usually try to sneak in drums in my build as we go along the game.  Venge can just turn a whole teamfight if played properly. That passive aura with that mana reduction feels so good for the team.

medical,fm0h3u5,t1_fm0denf,1585657560.0,"I really don't know if there is any family history of something like this happening. It started last summer as far as I can remember, because I thought at first that my heart was hurting, but my doctor told me that it's a back problem. He really didn't look into it, like I didn't do any serious test. I forgot to mention that it's not only the back left zone, but it stretches till the chest left zone. It doesn't hurt constantly, but when I press against my lower zone of the armpit, there it hurts. Also my left neck area hurts when I press it or stretch it. Once I stretched in a way to see how bad the pain is, and it wasn't unbearable, but it was going so far that my left eye was hurting I think. I always assumed that it's because I had a very bad routine that whole summer, sitting in a bad position for like 10 hours+ and smoking, not making any exercises at all."

This guy in particular gave me a weird vibe, cause I met him in that episode when he randomly started hitting this guy. I talk with him and I am ok with him, even helped him once, but Idk, he lives in my dorm and I just dislike him a lot. He is the only one that seems dumb enough to find it hilarious."

movies,fkhpu9w,t1_fkho1co,1584203722.0,"It sounds like a dumb answer, but everything had an impact on me. I could feel the cruelty and the fakeness of the warden, using the protagonist for his money laundry while maintaining this image of a man that  praises god, even punishing Andy and killing Tommy for its own interest. I loved that the movie didn't spoil itself , you had no idea if he really killed his wife and her lover from the beginning. I also enjoyed how they developed the relationships between the prisoners, they felt like true and real people, showing that they can care for one another. The dialogue was also really good imo. Also the situations that they go through, they are still humans, they enjoy what ""free"" people enjoy, like music or reading. It was really sad the struggle that Red and Brooks had once they were free, like I could understand that it has to be hard for them being used with being in prison and now starting from the beginning, having no idea where to start from. I can barely manage my life , imagine a man that was locked in prison for 40 years. The whole movie moved me, thinking deeply about my life and life in general. I hope what I said don't make me look dumb or anything, it's kinda hard for me to explain my thought process during the movie."

The thing is Bf works with ur ult which is great, but going Mjolrn lets you hit much more faster. I think atm a good build on a winning lane as jugg is Bf, MoM and Sange and Yasha."
DotA2,fk0sdp3,t1_fk0s7af,1583765077.0,I was thinking about this while playing jugg. I had the farm to go Battle fury but at the same time Jugg loves attack speed so it's a tough choice.

AskReddit,fdmgyg9,t3_ejvqcl,1578549548.0,"Long post but I have to get this off my chest . So I was sitting in class at college next to a really attractive and smart girl, that I kinda liked, but never got to talk to her. Didn't exchange any words, until the last 5 min of the class. She wrote on my page ""Hey :)"" . I looked at her and I said something like "" Hmm it feels awkward I don't really know what to say"", cause I thought writing a simple Hey :) back would be too basic. My dumbass. So I think a little, and I write a word that in English can be translated something like ""Fuck off"", a word that if you change one letter and add one more means ""Thank you!"". I did that as a joke, because it happened to me to do this mistake on one of my facebook posts back in the day, and I wanted to explain her the whole situation and how the person at that time reacted to me saying that. But after going half through she told me to be quiet cause the teacher was looking at us, and he really didn't have a good mood that day. So I didn't get to tell her the context. Worse, she removed the last letter so the word was exactly the insulting one, probably considering me so stupid and idiotic that I can't even spell that word. So basically I fucked up all my chances with her by using an inside joke that it's not even funny, like at all, just dumb. This happened 2 months ago and I couldn't sleep thinking that I should go to her and apologize. But whenever I had the chance, was too embarrased about what I have done."

All year I was constantly forcing myself to vomit just to relieve my stress and anxiety. Maybe it is not as bad as your state , but I feel you. My opinion is to find a hobby that you enjoy and that takes your mind off the negative thoughts and vibe . That's how I try to cope with it. I still didn't find mine because I don't have the resources yet , but the thought of being able to reach it and actually start enjoying life more gives me hope. I too started to break some of my relationships with the few friends I have, even tho I believe socializing in my case would make all my bad feelings go away.
