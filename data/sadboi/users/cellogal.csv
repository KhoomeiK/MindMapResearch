BPD,fqynxr8,t3_g89xj5,1589751671.0,"I have exactly what you described. At first they weren’t sure if it was bipolar and BPD, but like you I don’t have the cycles, and it shifts way too quick to be bipolar (I can be manic for only like a day). Not sure if that’s helpful, but I have had the same experience and as of now my diagnosis is just BPD still"
BPD,fqv8xhs,t1_fqv7w80,1589672262.0,"I haven’t had much luck with my google
Search but I’ll definitely check in with the center I go to now. Thanks!"
BPD,fqv7mma,t1_fqtytsk,1589671512.0,That’s great! Can i ask how you found the group? I’m having trouble finding many around me.
obgyn,fqsp9jg,t1_fqsapb4,1589614114.0,"I have. That definitely makes it feel less intense, which feels good but still the same issue once I get too far in. Thanks for the suggestion though :)"
BPD,fqrcu6e,t1_fqqkxp5,1589581859.0,"That makes sense. I get how the parts are related, It’s just frustrating to want to do skills but not be able to find a group. I’ll have to keep looking I guess! Glad to know that’s a standard approach though. Thanks"
BPD,fqrco6g,t1_fqqkx3x,1589581772.0,This is really helpful. Thanks so much for taking the time to compile all of this. I’ve always heard of DBT as the main therapy that’s helpful for BPD so I’m really interested to research those other methods. :)
BPD,fqqj99z,t1_fqqegop,1589566483.0,Recently started lamictal and I second this. Mood stabilizers so far are working so much better than any of the SSRIs I tried worked for me.
BPD,fqq5x2l,t1_fqq4otq,1589559946.0,"Yeah that’s where my providers were confused too, that’s why they weren’t sure if some of my BPD symptoms could be hypomania (or I guess vice versa). 

Currently I am seeing my therapist online, but we used to meet in person before covid. She was able to find me some resources for local DBT groups that are now meeting online. They usually have new openings periodically. It seems like several of the ones near me are taking new members in June. Most seem to be self pay, but I’ve found a few that take my insurance (just something else to consider)."
BPD,fqq3w6i,t3_gk660i,1589558958.0,"I jus started recently so I can share my insight! 

My psychiatrist said it was super super important to work my dose up slowly. I started at 25 for two weeks, then 50 for two weeks and will be starting 100 tonight. I think doing this helped with the side effects because I haven’t had any. I feel a little more meh but I think it’s because it’s evening out the almost manic highs I tend to get as well. 

I did have sleep issues at first but I’m sleeping great now. 

Overall I started noticing it was helping a few days into the 25, it seemed soon so who knows if it’s placebo affect. I was super excited about it (maybe just still a bit manic tbh). Now on the 50, I’m mostly noticing it’s helping my anxiety (I still worry but feel less of the physical sensations of panic), I do feel like my moods have evened out, but I am still having a lot of the emotional reactivity (hoping the bigger does helps). Overall I’d say it’s been fairly helpful so far, probably more helpful than other medications I’ve taken in the past.

Keep an eye out for any rash though, that’s the main thing to look for if you’re ramping the dose up quick."
BPD,fqq30s1,t3_gkbhsv,1589558535.0,"Hi! Not sure if I can offer much advice but just wanted to share that I was diagnosed first with depression, anxiety, and ADHD. obviously now it’s BPD and maybe a bipolar component. All that to say, so many of these diagnoses have overlapping criteria so it’s sometimes hard to piece apart what symptoms are caused by what (is my impulsiveness actually ADHD or was I misdiagnosed because of BPD traits?). I totally relate to what you’re going through. 

I definitely reccomend getting support. I have a therapist now and we do some DBT ish work while
I’m trying to find resources to do the full fledged BPD with skills+group work. It’s definitely helpful, but I think more DBT would be even better. It definitely can’t hurt to talk to any provider though and see what they recommend. I used the psychology today tool to find someone near me and I filtered by people who are familiar with BPD and can also provide some level of DBT informed work. 

I also found that mood stabilizers have started to help me with some of my BPD symptoms, If that’s something you’re open to and think may be helpful it’s worth looking into as well. 


Good luck!"
BPD,fqg7opd,t1_fqg06ty,1589339748.0,"Almost the exact same thing happened to me recently. It’s so hard, I feel so guilty and it’s so weird not being aware of it. I always fall back on the “it’s hard for me to be this way too” but I know that can be true and I can also hurt people. It sucks."
obgyn,fqbjmb7,t1_fqbizy5,1589238207.0,"Hey! I'm glad I'm not alone, but sorry you're experiencing this too. I was on psychiatric medication for a while (and am again now) but haven't been for the last few years so I'm sure if it's that unless it could be from being on meds before. That definitely gives me something to look into though! I didn't think about a possible connection there."

I have this terrible anxiety that my therapist will think I'm making things up or think I'm faking it too (which she obviously won't because she's great but still).
