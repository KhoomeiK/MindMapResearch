Please report her to HR, this behaviour is unacceptable in any setting but she needs to receive repercussions for her behaviour in a professional setting as this may be the wake up call she desperately needs.

I’m sorry you’re struggling with body image issues and I hope you feel more accepting eventually. I have to agree with the other comments about finding clothes specifically designed for bigger bust and I hope this will encourage a bit more self love and you deserve to feel comfortable and confident in your own skin.

This awful girl has been projecting her insecurities on you from day one. It obviously is a way to make herself feel better constantly making remarks about you and then going as far as hand picking comments online to suit her narrative, boost her own ego and pull you down in the process. She is very obviously jealous and threatened by the size of your chest. 
There is absolutely nothing wrong with anyone’s chest size, it’s a shame she can’t see that and leave you alone.

Please know there are many people out there who love people for who they are regardless of body shape and size. You only deserve people who accept you for who you are. Drop this disgusting human out of your life and get HR to deal with her harassment. 
I hope you find a way to become more accepting and comfortable with yourself also, you deserve to be happy.

It is not your fault, the poor boy just decided it’s his time to go. She should have put him down as you suggested in January, but it’s very clear she was living in denial for a long time about his well being and didn’t want to accept he wasn’t going to be around anymore.

Leave her be and let her come to you when she’s got through the worst of her grief. The things you’ve done have been very kind and thoughtful, but she isn’t ready to hear any of it. If she doesn’t see reason once the worst has passed, then she really isn’t a decent friend.

University and schools over 16 have been put to distance if schools choose to do so (not mandatory). Same amount of people in stores and such, some restrictions on where you can sit on buses and signs up in some stores to stand 1.5 metres apart, however not many follow this in my experience. Some stores have screens in front of cashiers and some use gloves. 

I’m currently studying from home and so is my partner and only go out for groceries once a week at most and only if needed. This is been like this since early March for both of us. Despite restaurants, bars, coffee houses and clubs being open we don’t attend at all. I’ve had people in my student complex throw parties during the last few weeks and I must admit, that made me lose a little faith in people. 

Side note, someone I know in Stockholm is regularly going out to bars and such with colleagues from work and they have just gone back into teaching students like normal.

The only thing I found somewhat true, was the not talking to strangers randomly. I’m from the UK and people talk to each other quite a lot, whether it be in passing a random hello, being forewarned about something like ice, talking to someone about their dog or even just talking about the weather. For the most part, people have often seemed a bit rude... I was standing in people’s way a few times or bumped into someone (I’m a bit unaware of my surroundings sometimes) and instead of saying excuse me, I’ve been given dirty looks or huffed at, even when I’ve apologised. Back home, people would make a funny comment, banter or just say “no worries” and ofc sometimes the occasional dickhead. 

I’ve seen people and their dogs, my natural thing to do is talk to the owner and pet the dog if allowed. My partner (who’s a swede) has told me so many times, “people don’t like that here”, it’s really hard to drop some social habits like that.

toastme,fk481ys,t1_fk479f9,1583855217.0,Yea reading this now... he doesn’t seem like a very nice person. I hope this is a one off. The daughter is such a sweetheart though.
toastme,fk47vum,t3_fga6fd,1583855117.0,"First thing I noticed was your hair, it’s lovely! The colour is incredible and the cut frames your face so well. 

Don’t listen to your husband, it’s your hair and you should love it! We all do!"

Once your girlfriend dumps you, please stay single for the sake of every potential person you could be with, you’d save them the trouble."
Coronavirus,fjuotzi,t1_fjuli2c,1583618727.0,Yea I meant it in the way that we should be less like America. My wording may have gave the wrong impression though.
Coronavirus,fjspehm,t1_fjsgfx8,1583599344.0,"I think one of the more concerning things is whether or not these “100 tests a day” are reserved only for Stockholm or if testing is happening further afield. There was a student in Lund diagnosed with Covid-19 and nothing has been reported since besides any students living in his residence being advised. 100 tests a day in Stockholm is small, 100 tests across the country is pathetic IMO.

America should be an example for how testing and quarantine should be proactive and less reactive."
Coronavirus,fjrounu,t1_fjrle2o,1583588334.0,"No one is wanting to stop people from returning home, they are simply wanting a better handle on the situation. Various reports are saying it is contagious before showing symptoms, so surely you’d want to contain that by requiring people to stay home for 2 weeks rather than putting more people at risk. 

Various other countries are doing this and more will follow."
Coronavirus,fjrkgyz,t1_fjrk1by,1583586606.0,"I agree that this is a concern too. It may be contained in the numbers they have confirmed infected, but there are people entering the country left and right, unchecked, untested and potentially a carrier. Other countries are handling this better IMO."
Coronavirus,fjrk34f,t1_fjri1q6,1583586412.0,I wasn’t implying they were seriously ill. But to have testing reserved only for people with pneumonia seems fairly severe imo. Maybe I’m misinformed but this was reported about Sweden a few days back.
Coronavirus,fjrhs76,t1_fjrgl2i,1583585583.0,"Sweden is burying its head in the sand, they aren’t testing people unless they show severe symptoms and if they’ve been in specific countries. Which is ridiculous because community spread has very likely (definitely) already happened. 

I hope you get well friend"
Coronavirus,fjq207o,t1_fjpims6,1583565714.0,"I don’t think you are overreacting, I’m seeing a lot of people online and people I know say it’s nothing, just a cold, no big deal etc. Not taking any precautions or caring for others at all, they think it’s just elderly at risk and they aren’t thinking of people who have compromised immune systems etc. 
However, I also know some people who are sick and have pneumonia and are isolating themselves despite not being diagnosed yet, just in case. 

I know someone who flew to Japan just two days ago, someone who flew to turkey and someone who’s heading to Greece in the next few weeks. I hope they don’t get sick/pass it on to others."
