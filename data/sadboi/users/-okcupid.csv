I think sometimes that happens bc you start a relationship by getting to know someone and are in contact maybe a lot and then it sort of sets the expected tone, so when that contact tapers it‚Äôs perhaps confusing. I‚Äôm finding ideally I would check in with whomever and chat a little throughout the day but mostly lead my own life. I think otherwise a lot of contact with no substance and just attention feels sorta unhealthily codependent. Also finding people
Who are okay with sitting with themselves and not needing attention constantly. sorta rambling sorry but I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot lately as I‚Äôve had a hard time w it in the past. I hope you find someone who fits the bill"

IWantToLearn,fpnjo1a,t3_gehzcs,1588765073.0,"Do your kids want you to have fun with them or can tell that you‚Äôre stressed and want you to have fun for yourself? 
If the former, perhaps there are things that you, your partner and kids can all lightheartedly enjoy and have fun doing. Making time to do fun things is important, sometimes just as important as work. 
If the latter- I think its sweet that your kids want you to have fun. Remember that your kids want you to be happy and it‚Äôs coming from a place of love and not criticism. I know when one has a lot of responsibilities it‚Äôs really hard to be fun. I know. But doing fun things, having fun is good for the soul and benefits everyone in your life. You deserve to have fun!! 
Lastly, try not to beat yourself up if you can‚Äôt be ‚Äúfun‚Äù in the typical way. What is considered fun is different for everyone. Try to find things you enjoy and make you happy and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll benefit you, your partner and your kids as well."

The exercise you're speaking about in the second paragraph is called ""Life-Mapping."" Here are some links to get started on that:

[https://www.mycallingiq.com/the-life-map-exercise/](https://www.mycallingiq.com/the-life-map-exercise/)

[Life Mapping](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/52a59879e4b04ff3be08d909/t/57845718e3df287846935d1e/1468290841160/Life+Mapping+Tool.pdf)

[https://ccojubilee.org/am-site/media/life-mapping-exercise.pdf](https://ccojubilee.org/am-site/media/life-mapping-exercise.pdf) (this one has a religious component, which you can ignore if you want to lol)

[http://www.tcpc.org.au/images/docs/Life%20Map%20Instructions.pdf](http://www.tcpc.org.au/images/docs/Life%20Map%20Instructions.pdf)

There are many different approaches to the exercise, so you can google if none of the above seem to work for you and find one that does or maybe even combine a few. Your Life Map, your rules!

Second, it's really great you're reading up and trying to figure things out. I am not too familiar with attachment styles (I believe I am anxious preoccupied, which means hey we seek each other out!)  so I can't offer further advice about that but I think continuing to read and trying to parse out things that are applicable to you is a wonderful start. I know it probably seems daunting to do so. Here are some links about altering your attachment style:

[https://psychcentral.com/lib/how-to-change-your-attachment-style/](https://psychcentral.com/lib/how-to-change-your-attachment-style/)

[https://www.psychalive.org/change-attachment-style-better-life/](https://www.psychalive.org/change-attachment-style-better-life/)

The last bit of this article I like, ""Insight means realizing why things worked out as they did, why you are how you are, why they were how they were. It's not about making excuses for anyone. It's about assessing the depths and locations of the scars in your inner landscape so you don't keep falling into those same patterns for the rest of your life."" 

A lot of these articles suggest therapy as well. I know that sort of thing is a privilege but if you are able to swing it, that could be very beneficial in understanding yourself more and changing the parts that you would like to. 

I don't know how helpful the above will be but I hope it helps a bit. I want to just say again that I am proud of you for wanting change and wanting to find the light in the darkness. I know you can be happier and more fulfilled, it just takes time and effort. You got this. You can message me if you ever need to talk or vent, I will try to be there for you"
mentalillness,fp9xdnc,t3_gbrb8k,1588436526.0,"Hi buttercup- if you still need someone to speak to you can message me. I struggle with the same issues and it‚Äôs really really difficult and makes life unbearable sometimes. I know it‚Äôs hard but you‚Äôre not alone! Not at all!! You are strong and loved and though we don‚Äôt know one another, I care about you so much. Feel free to message me!"
