AskReddit,fqqtqew,t3_gge8dn,1589571793.0,"When I was a freshman, this boy in my english class passed away because he was napping on the couch while his family was gone and they had a very old furnace, it broke and filled the house with carbon monoxide where he died in his sleep. Somewhere either at the end of sophomore year or in junior year, this really sweet kid who was bullied for autism hung himself. I used to play DnD with his sister and his mom was my best friends therapist so that one hit harder than the others especially when his mom quit her job because she lost confidence because she felt if she couldn't help her own son then she couldn't help anybody else. Then at the end of junior year a freshman OD'd on some sort of tainted LSD or something along those lines. Overall it was strange to have people your own age die, especially so many in such a small amount of time. It puts you on edge, especially the people in my year, it makes you feel like ""who's next?"" When theres been a death every year. We just finished senior year thankfully with no more deaths but months back we all thought one of us was going to be next because of a school shooting scare. I just feel like since I've known so many people to die before reaching 18 its made me less emotional about death and to feel more neutral and unphased."
