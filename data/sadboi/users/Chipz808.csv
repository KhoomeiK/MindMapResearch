I joined a jiu jitsu club and went 5 times a week. Of course now with covid, I can‚Äôt go but I‚Äôve been doing okay (not great) to my surprise. I had a lot of homework to do as well which took my mind off of it. I‚Äôm also a gamer and that help take my mind off it as well. These are just examples and you can do other things. It‚Äôs a personal preference. Do the things that you enjoy. Oh and interacting with others helps a lot too. Like I said I still have anxiety but I‚Äôm trying to get better. We can try together like the other people that are trying on this sub as well :)"

depression,faiqli5,t1_faipmyc,1576114271.0,That seems to be trend. My psych says it‚Äôs common for anxiety to transition to depression. Same thing happened to me. Got my anxiety under control at least as it seems and now struggling with depression.

My life was normal and i was happy before all this. Don‚Äôt know wtf happened. I‚Äôm doing pretty bad in college now where I used to be a straight A student. I used to have bad intrusive thoughts but that is starting to fade out. I‚Äôm now stuck in depression mostly now. It‚Äôs like my anxiety turned into depression. It sucks but I can‚Äôt help but believe that I‚Äôll get out of this. My symptoms seem to relieve at night and are worse in the morning. You are definitely not alone.
Anxiety,fa8iru7,t3_e6ndrz,1575847200.0,"My anxiety troubles started about 5 months ago. I know exactly what you mean and I thought I was just going nuts. I always had eye floaters but ever since my mental health became bad, they‚Äôve seem to be more intense and noticeable. The sensitivity to the sun also started up around that time as well. It doesn‚Äôt bother me physically though so I just try to ignore it. It did bother me for a while until I just got over it."
DepressionRecovery,fa1i644,t3_e7hqdg,1575770160.0,"I think your doc is going to tell you to stay on it for a couple months before tapering off because you don‚Äôt want to relapse.

antidepressants,fa0rmrm,t1_fa0r34v,1575759149.0,Is that right? Maybe upping the dose for me won‚Äôt be such a bad idea then. I just really hope this medication will work for my depression and anxiety as I can tolerate it pretty well. Haven‚Äôt tried 30 yet though.
antidepressants,fa0nryv,t1_fa0mcnx,1575757784.0,What are your reasons for being prescribed it? Does it help your depression at that dose if you have depression?
depressionregimens,f9vm6hd,t1_f9vkstu,1575673884.0,I think you‚Äôll get that weight off soon. A month off may not be long enough because you were on it for 6. Your weight should drop given more time especially if you eat a healthier diet.

Meditation,f82w6ya,t1_f82vv35,1574199399.0,You don‚Äôt necessarily have to do the lotus position all the time. I do a meditation in the morning usually in that position but sometimes I just sit down with a straight back. I also do one before I sleep and I just do that laying down. I actually enjoy laying down and meditating a lot but it‚Äôs hard not to fall asleep sometimes which is a problem if that happens to you as well.
Meditation,f82vclk,t3_dyqop8,1574198937.0,You can start with breathing meditation. 5 second inhale through the nose. Hold for 3 seconds then exhale. Rinse and repeat.

Borderlands,f6u8qsr,t3_dstbbw,1573159576.0,Not gonna lie. I miss the Hyperion bots. I loved shooting their limbs off with a sniper and then finishing them off with one more crit to their red eye thing. The super badass bots were really bad ass too.

SSRIs,f5otoq1,t3_dl9dd8,1572331654.0,Hmm I know a person who got off Zoloft once he got stable and he seems fine. I also don‚Äôt think mirtazapine is an SSRI btw. It‚Äôs prescribed more as a sleeping pill if I‚Äôm not mistaken. I think you‚Äôll be fine.

DepressionRecovery,f403dt5,t1_f403413,1571283805.0,Thank you. I‚Äôm just curious because I might be getting on meds as well. Thanks again for your time. :)
BrainFog,f3z7s7r,t3_di2rhm,1571263875.0,I think it‚Äôs anxiety getting the best of you. Plus you were only on them for 5 days. Antidepressants are known to spike anxiety up and people stop them before it gets better. Your anxiety probably just got spiked up and stayed there and your mind is playing tricks on you that it was the drug‚Äôs fault since you are thinking you fried your brain but you really didn‚Äôt.
DepressionRecovery,f3yh8t7,t1_f3yh5hs,1571253959.0,Oh np. And ty.
DepressionRecovery,f3y7353,t3_de47lm,1571249615.0,May i ask what anti depressant you take?
Borderlands,f3sm8ro,t3_dhjwww,1571105102.0,I finally fucking got one. Was on the same boat as OP.
Borderlands,f3ftx8u,t3_dgsijc,1570902586.0,Haha yeah. Wait till you get the doom gun. I managed to get two. One for Zane and one for Fl4k. Fl4k puts Zane to shame with that gun.
Borderlands,f39t07k,t1_f39srbo,1570755138.0,I would say yes he is gear dependent. The best build for him imo is infinite grenades. Plus if you get the flakker legendary with your digi clone. You‚Äôre basically unstoppable.
antidepressants,f39jvpm,t1_f2brmxh,1570749405.0,How come you tried so many if one worked for you? I‚Äôm just curious because I might be starting Prozac soon.
Borderlands,f39i7aj,t3_dg5y9q,1570748456.0,Moze if you wanna smash your face on your pc or controller. Zane if you want the best character dialogue. They‚Äôre both fun. Zane‚Äôs my main :)
prozac,f38zy4u,t3_dcyrr8,1570742006.0,A lot of people quit their antidepressant before it gets better then they write terrible reviews on it. Don‚Äôt let those guys fool you.
prozac,f38v619,t3_ddime6,1570740383.0,Been a bit since you post this. You doing alright?
Anxiety,f37y79v,t1_f37ee8u,1570731654.0,"You got a lot of people in here probably bringing your hopes down. Anxiety is the most treatable mental illness. Anxiety is a normal thing but when you have a disorder, it is a beast that you have to conquer. So no anxiety is not curable because everybody has anxiety but with treatment, you can bring it down to normal levels like how a normal person experiences anxiety."

Meditation,f2wzcqc,t3_deg9nt,1570471952.0,The breethe app has a 12 week training on meditation. Including hundred of more different meditations and other goodies as well. I really like the app.
Borderlands,f2wyvnx,t1_f2wwlmo,1570471803.0,Play Zane if you want the best character dialogue. I agree that he is also fun because he‚Äôs not as op as the rest which means it‚Äôs more challenging.

antidepressants,f2g90u8,t3_d8d8el,1570227916.0,"Hey, if you‚Äôre feeling better then that‚Äôs the key. You don‚Äôt need to be on these forever.
