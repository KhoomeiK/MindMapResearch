Occasionally I feel slightly frustrated at the person who says 'i'm so sorry' to me, but I think it's when I don't feel close to them. it feels inauthentic or meaningless in the situation if they have no idea what I'm going through and I had no intention of opening up to them about it."

I actually think Western actors would love to be in kdrama-style tv shows.

The thing is though, kdramas are from women's perspective but it's a kind of false perspective because it's non sexualized. If CLOY was actually giving Yoon Seri's perspective, for instance, Ri Jeong Hyeok would be sexualized way more in the show. 

I agree that kdramas are much better than what western movies and tv offer. It's so outrageous how Hollywood completely disregards the majority of their audience. There clearly needs to be way more women writers and directors hired, in order for things to change."
