dysautonomia,fk9zd8j,t3_fedpm0,1583987513.0,"This exact thing used to happen to me all the time a couple years back. Something would stress me out, my eyes would roll back, and then I would just collapse on the ground. My doctor ruled out seizures of any other conditions and said it was super bad panic attacks!"

OccupationalTherapy,fhf0vdb,t3_f2keuy,1581533906.0,I love this so much. It‚Äôs super creative and kids will love it!

neuroscience,fdqikjv,t3_em1bot,1578667550.0,"If you want somewhat of a break from highly academic material and more of a good novel, the book still alice by Lisa Genova is super good! It‚Äôs about early onset Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Lisa Genova also writes other books too that I‚Äôll probably check out soon!"
Anxiety,fdqgrzo,t3_emb5oj,1578666281.0,"Yeah I feel like when my anxiety and stress gets bad enough it just sucks all the energy out of my body. It‚Äôs a sympathetic nervous system thing-anxiety makes your heart beat faster,etc. anxiety is literally a workout for your body."

ChronicIllness,fdh6na8,t3_dfokf7,1578416519.0,"The medical community is sure ignorant when it comes to this illness and it makes me angry. SO many people suffer from it compared to some other illnesses out there that get more funding and attention (like Parkinson‚Äôs,als, Huntington‚Äôs, I could go on and on)"
ChronicIllness,fdh5lvo,t3_ei7lsw,1578415879.0,I know not many physical or occupational therapists (or any medical professionals) have much experience with this debilitating condition so I took it onto myself to do a little looking into it this past semester and wrote a research paper on it. Some of the things that I found that may help could be measuring your anaerobic threshold so you can learn to better manage your condition before you get to the point of over exerting yourself. This test pretty much measures the point where you stop burning o2 and start burning lactic acid! Another thing to look into (as a last resort because it‚Äôs pretty expensive) would be trying the drug ampligen or thinking about getting into a clinical trial if there is any available. I‚Äôm sorry you suffer from this and hope you find something that works/helps you  in the future!
depression,fd37vm1,t3_ejt9jo,1578155586.0,This is the most insensitive comment that I have ever read on reddit. Like others said and I will reiterate: you are not responsible for other people‚Äôs happiness! People do not choose to feel this way! Suicide is a last resort for most people after they feel they have exhausted every other option available.

OccupationalTherapy,fc7fhyo,t3_egdn27,1577505868.0,If you haven‚Äôt looked into it I highly recommend using biofeedback/ the stress eraser machine! It pretty much teaches you how to breathe effectively to activate the parasympathetic nervous system more. Knowing that it may be hard for kids (especially the younger ones) to grasp abstract concepts completely sometimes it helps to physically see the biological responses related to anxiety.
selfhelp,fbxkv7d,t3_eeka34,1577192134.0,It‚Äôs all good! I had a 4.0 and got my first D of my life this semester and instead of my family being mad at me they all high fived me! I‚Äôm going for occupational therapy and I talked to my advisor about it and he said it doesn‚Äôt matter it just means you‚Äôre human
OccupationalTherapy,fbcwrgs,t3_ecgt7p,1576736598.0,Thanks for the input! It‚Äôs nice to see situations that stress me out through other people‚Äôs eyes once in a whileüòä
depression,fb3lv5c,t3_eb0ggo,1576477856.0,"I used to have thoughts like this all the time years back. I actually acted on those thoughts twice, obviously unsuccessful or I wouldn‚Äôt be typing this right now. After going through more medications than I can count my doctor finally realize they had my major depressive disorder diagnosis mixed up the whole time-I really had bipolar disorder. With bipolar disorder comes a lot of impulsivity, such as the random thought and/or action that you are just done with life. I know how intrusive those thoughts can be and with that there‚Äôs no shame in seeing a doctor-to talk and/or look at different medications that might help. You‚Äôre not alone! I thought it might help to share my experience with you and I hope you get to feeling better soon!"
PanicAttack,fagq6j3,t3_e7od05,1576067551.0,"The only thing that has helped my panic attacks (I‚Äôm 20 and also have had bad panic attacks since high school) is my ativan to be completely honest. There‚Äôs such a negative stigma around benzodiazepines because they are abused by some but when used correctly and on an as needed basis (not all the time- I maybe take one every 1-2 months) they are very effective I have found. I also have cut down my panic attacks so I don‚Äôt have severe ones very often, but when I do it helps to know there is something there if I need it to calm me down."
