BUT (again, just my experience in my part of Canada) I know quite a few people who have started working in schools after they finished their bachelor of education, and then if they want to do their masters or get further certifications, those are paid for by the school. I might look into it first and see if unions/ schools in the area you plan to work help pay for masters programs as that would save you some money. Also I’ve heard from some teachers that I know that they purposely upgraded their education after they started working as often teachers with higher education wouldn’t get hired because they automatically had to be paid more without the years of teaching experience. Whereas if they had some experience / few years in at a school and then took their masters, they would be more likely to be kept on with the higher pay requirement."

AskReddit,fo2t3ge,t3_g53q03,1587473400.0,"I realize that I was the only one putting in effort and that everything was about her. We were friends for 8 years. She had a really strong personality and it turned a lot of people off. She was very particular whereas I was go with the flow, so it seemed like we fit as friends. She often faced the criticism that she always turned the conversation to talk about herself and was arrogant. She had told me that she would become insecure about herself during a conversation and that’s what brought her to talk about herself. For some reason, I believed her. She was also kind, friendly, energetic, good at making friends and outgoing when I met her. But she had some habits that badly effected others and put a strain on our relationship. 

Whenever we had a disagreement, instead of being open to it she would ignore me for months. In high school, she ignored me for 3 months because we disagreed about what the motive of a news broadcast was. She sat across the room from me every lunch, we had the same friends. I just wanted to talk to her and tell her that I was sorry that something that didn’t seem like anything to me had become something that really hurt her. I missed my friend and it seemed like such a stupid thing to not talk over. Looking back, I know she wasn’t mad about what happened, she was just too anxious to put herself out there to reach out to me. 

I have anxiety too so I always let myself be someone she could talk thing over with and be an understanding ear. I’d much rather talk things out, see both sides of an argument and work to fix things if it was something I was involved in. 

Over the years, her anxiety worsened. I tried to be there for her. I tried to help her build her anxiety which seemed to be the crutch of her anxiety. I cared about her and was willing to do anything I could. She again and again would pull stints where she ignored me for months and months. Sometimes she would chose certain friends to ignore, while talking to others everyday. I wasn’t the only one who experienced this. 

The last time she cut me out was a 6 month time period. To be fair to her, she told me that she was struggling and needed some time to herself. It’s something she had never done before. I love her that I loved her and that I was always there for her (I only lived a 5 min walk away). Turns out, within a few weeks she was hanging out with all of our other friends again. This was January, and I didn’t hear from her until July. I felt horrible. I felt like I must have done something to hurt her. When I finally heard back from her, she said she felt I would be disappointed that it took so long to hear from her, and that anxiety grew for 6 months.

If that was the only issue in our friendship, I probably wouldn’t have friend broken up with her. The major issue was that in the last few years of our friendship she didn’t put any effort in and showed how inconsiderate she was of other people’s time. 

We lived 5 mins away from eachother for 2 years of our friendship and she never once accepted and invite over, to go on a walk or invited me over. Every time we hung out, everything was always about her. I rarely had the chance to talk about my life or receive support from her. 

That last fall we were friends we had a mutual friend getting married about an hour and a half away from where we lived. The ceremony was at 2pm. I wanted to leave by 12 because I had never driven there before and wanted to give a buffer for if we got lost/ be a little early as it’s a wedding. I got to her house and she wasn’t ready. She’s a chronically late person and blames it on having to do her make up (she probably drops $1000 at Sephora a year). I told her she could finish her make up in the car since I was driving and she said she hadn’t packed it yet. I agreed to go pick us up lunch and by the time I was back (15 mins ish) she would be ready to go. I came back and she wasn’t. I told her I was leaving at 12:30 with or without her. We left about 12:30 and I was racing on the highway to get to the wedding with a few minutes to spare. On the drive she realized that she had forgot her mascara and texted some friends at the wedding to see if she could borrow theirs, one friend said yes. We got there about 10 minutes before the ceremony, so I wanted to leave the car and go sit for the ceremony so we wouldn’t interrupt the wedding of our super punctual friend. She refused to leave the car because she needed to put mascara on first and wanted our other friend to bring it to her. I told her that she wouldn’t be in any photos during the ceremony and no one would probably notice cause they would be looking at the wedding party. She refused to move. I said fuck it and left my car unlocked and went to the ceremony and sat down. Everyone else was kind of shocked when I told them what happened. I was trying to be nice about it. Our friend was like “no I’m not delivering mascara to her, the wedding starts in a few minutes”. I was frantically texting her to get her ass to the wedding and she showed up literally 2 minutes before the bride walked down the aisle. 

The rest of the wedding she complained to me about how she thought everyone hated her. When some people asked her and I to go get ice cream before the reception, she finally started to relax a bit. 

The final straw was when I texted about a month after the wedding her telling her something upsetting in my life and she ignored me for 5 days, until I texted her again calling her out. For years she ignored me when something upsetting happened. For example, when I was sexually assaulted, she didn’t respond for months. I had always tried to be there for her but I felt like I was being pushed away and that she didn’t care about me anymore. Like I was just being used when it fitted her. When I called her out she yelled at me and told me that her toilet had clogged (for 5 days?) and that “my overflowing toilet is more important than your problems”. 

Ended the friendship there. Sometimes I feel sad about it because we were friends for so long, but I think she wasn’t a good friend anymore and she treated a lot of the people in her life like shit. No regrets here."

PersonalFinanceCanada,fnxmotg,t1_fnxcu01,1587341866.0,"I had a friend that was in a similar situation. She lived close enough to her university that she could have bussed from her parents nice suburbs house to the university each day, BUT she says her parents would only let her live at home through university if she bought a brand new car. They were controlling about how many hours she could work a week in high school and over the summers, so she didn’t really have enough saved to afford weekly or biweekly payments, insurance, etc. 

On the flip side, she was always really terrible with managing her money. She often binged on make up, take out and clothes. Her parents paid for her whole degree so that she wouldn’t have to worry about debt after school. They assumed that she would have enough saved to have a good amount paid down on the car and some savings like her older sister did by the end of her degree. Once you were out of school, you were out of the house. 

More than a year after she finished her business degree, she was working at Starbucks, only eating take out and constantly having her parents pay her rent for her.  Her parents were so controlling that she never really learned how to manage her own money, and never really learned to save because they would always bail her out/ she could just call up Daddy and he would fix it for her."
