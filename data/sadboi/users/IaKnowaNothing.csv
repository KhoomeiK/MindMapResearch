By feeling like a man is forcing you to have sex, it takes away the responsibility from the female that they want or like this bad, dirty thing that they aren't supposed to be doing and now they can actually completely relax and enjoy the sensations.

The guy just couldn't get on with his life because he was so tore up with guilt and shame. Everyone was like, yep that's good enough for ya. Some were even telling him to kill himself.

The only security a child has in the world is that her parents love her. She is scared in that moment... No, she is terrified. What does a terrified animal do? It doesn't cry, it lashes out, it bites. That hug from her Dad reassured her that maybe she isn't hated by him and gave her the time to calm down enough to move on from lashing out (fear) to something else. Seeking validation from you. The constant asking if you're disappointed is her trying to figure out if you still love her or if she's about to lose you forever which to a child is like losing the earth forever.

You don't know what to say and you're sure the shame is seeping out of your eyes, visible for everyone to see. Your shame and insecurities laid bare in a puddle of yourself. Just laying there, thinking, ""What is the point of me?"""

AskReddit,f3mx4k6,t1_f3mvi5r,1570992903.0,"About 15 years ago I tried to end it all by taking lots and lots of painkillers. I woke up the next day on my side with a vomit still in my mouth (gross, sorry). One of the first things I properly remember in hospital is how rough my teeth felt. When I ran my tongue across my teeth they felt almost spikey. Although this  went away after a week or so I've been left with unbelievably sensitive teeth and in the last couple of years I've noticed substantial discolouration. I'm 34. I know it's hard to say without looking at my teeth but do you think I'd still have enamel left?"
AskReddit,f3mtt7y,t1_f3ml0fa,1570992008.0,Is it true that if you have lost most of the enamel on your teeth there is no point in whitening as the dentin underneath is impossible to Whiten?

NPD,f3djfqk,t3_dgmc88,1570838438.0,"Just dropping in to say that I really hope you can find some peace a happiness at some point in your life. I really believe that with the right therapy for you, you'll get there. I don't have NPD but I know what it's like to not really know what the hell is wrong with you and to live your life feeling like you somehow aren't really supposed to be here, like this life wasn't meant for you, like you're ""different"". Like I said, I don't know what's ""wrong"" with me. The closest I can come to diagnosing myself is either CPTSD or BPD but all any of the numerous therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists I've seen on the NHS, since I was 15 years old would diagnose me with is depression and anxiety. Cognitive behavioural therapy worked a little bit. Dialectical behavioral therapy worked for a little while too, but ""it"" always slowly crept back in until it floored me again. Eventually I said fuck it and found the forty pounds a week to see a private therapist who specialises in something called Internal Family Systems Therapy, which I had been researching for a while. It's helping me. Really helping me. The years have gone by and I'm slowly becoming a functioning human being. It's a slow process and I believe I'll be in therapy forever but getting to the core, the real ROOT of a problem is never fast and never easy. I don't know if this is the therapy that will help you but I'm putting it out there just in case. You deserve to have peace. Good luck to you."
