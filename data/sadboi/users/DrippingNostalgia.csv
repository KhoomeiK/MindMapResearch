ArchitecturalRevival,fmedxa0,t1_fmecrq0,1586000414.0,"I live in Ghent and I've been quite a few times in Brussels. 

The main reason that I'm not a fan of Brussels is because of how spread out it is. There are all these different neighborhoods but there's not really a centre. Another reason is the extreme mix and lack of harmony, of a general theme architecture-wise. There are brutalist buildings, art nouveau, classicism, art deco, giant blocks and buildings and old herehuizen. It's not coherent. For example the European district is so massive and overwhelming, while there are these little streets just next to it. It's also quite filthy but that's in every big city the case so it wouldnt be right to critisize Brussels for that. 
It's just the perfect example of Belgium: breaking little pieces here and there down and changing it a little, like 'koterijen': you build a house, you get it renovated in a way that's questionable, then you decide to add a modern garagebox, you build a storageroom in your garden for all the gardenequipment, a veranda, a bikes storage, etc. In the end you have a 1000 styles and 'lapmiddel' but the whole itself isn't pleasing and harmonious. 
So Brussels has its beautiful corners and special places, but it's hard to get an all-containing feeling or view about it. It's kind of absurd, the cliché about Belgium that's actually right. 
Honestly I love Belgium, even its absurdity, but to love Brussels you need lots of courage, time and experience. Everytime I go there, I still don't feel home."

The acting is excellent and I like the subtle references in the libretto. On the other hand the melody is repetitive and superficial : I honestly don't get the fuss about minimalist works, as it is neither beautiful nor captivating. The constant upside spiral melody is tiring and the constant repitition of the text is boring.

If the concept of the exchange itself wouldn't have been introduced in the southern part of the Netherlands in the 14th century and if the nothern Netherlands wouldn't have been built by the braindrain of wealth and kwoledge from citizens of the wealthy, southern cities of what Burgundy used to be, than there wouldn't have been an Amsterdam of VOC. I can keep going back in time to put each 'achievement' in perspective. 

I think it's important to not get blinded by historical nationalism. After all it seems to be that many don't know enough of history and derive whitout any reason a sense of proud from it. This example in the newspaper struck me the most: a recent study shows that 46% of the Dutch youth think that the Dutch East Indies are something to be proud of. To them I'd like to say to remember the last chapter of Max Havelaar.

As you might have noticed by now, I must admit that I'm Belgian. I will also admit that as a Belgian, it has been very annoying that the Dutch show such a great arrogance and laugh at Belgium, because we also have our merits. A very present example of the arrogance of the Dutch is the way they deal with the Corona crisis: the non chalance of the government is astonishing. I think that this time I can be proud of us little Belgians that the tables for this time have turned, though it would have been better for the world's health that the Dutch would have tackled this crisis more steadily and strongly.

You can see that with WW2 as well. As it becomes longer and longer ago, our historical view upon it is changing. On one hand we can study it more objectively because of the distance in time, but on the other hand people tend to forget what the battle, the resistance, the horror was all about. This is where extreme right and left, and anti-semitism, relativism comes around the corner. When I watched a documentary about the resistance in Belgium I was once again chilled by the stories of sabotaging the nazi's, their absolute anger and disgust of collaborators, how some returned and some didnt from the camps. It makes you wonder. I thought for example that resistance will be less and less possible because of all the data they could control. Jews would ben instantly recognized and Found by the camera's on the street, the camera's in our laptops, etc. 

History should not be studied in a ahistorical way as you point out as well. Times were different and history isn't an ever rising line of good, progress and morality. (And after all the West is rich because of their gruesome past.) I do still think that we should look at history objectively (what happened when, what is cause and what is effect, etc) and thereafter ask ourselves what we can learn from past mistakes: this can be meant in an economical, political, moralist, etc way.
