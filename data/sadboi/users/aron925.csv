Since initially exploring Taoism I have found myself listening to more ambient/instrumental music (Aphex Twin, Walter Wanderly, Hailu Mergia to name a few). I‚Äôve also been listening to a lot of Brazilian  samba and French music such as Astrud Gilberto & Stacey Kent. Something about it being in a foreign language makes it easier for me to get lost in the music and enter a natural flow state of being, so I have a ton of music like that in my cooking playlist. I‚Äôve also been loving really relaxing EDM such as the tune ‚ÄúLiverpool Street in the Rain‚Äù by Mall Grab. I guess discovering Taoism has made me crave a new type of music which allows me to try and focus on just being and listening."

BeachHouse,fl1gnky,t1_fl15mn4,1584728622.0,"For me that line reminds me of images and symbols that I associate with my mother and how they make me feel. For ex. when I think about the worst times, I see my view standing at the bottom of the stairs looking up at her bedroom door where she was frequently passed out (at all times of the day really) but specifically when I would come home from school. Sometimes I‚Äôd come back to a dinner she drunkenly started making (at 2pm!?) and then I guess forgot about. There would be burnt shit in the oven and lettuce strewn about the counter. So I‚Äôd have to clean it all and make a new dinner for me and my dad when he came home a few hours later. Another ‚Äútotem‚Äù that comes to mind is her bathrobe which is the only thing she would wear for days sometimes as she had nowhere to dress up for really. Also the image of paramedics standing in our home on multiple occasions while she was having alcohol-induced seizures. These images bring me so much pain and make my heart ache for how alone I felt back then and how much precious life my mother has wasted. But they also serve as images that guide me spiritually; they remind me not to repeat her mistake of forgetting how to enjoy life and to be present in the lives of people who matter most to me. I feel like what I‚Äôm describing are more of my traumatizing memories than ‚Äútotems‚Äù in the traditional sense, but that‚Äôs what comes to mind when I listen. Rough Song makes me feel like these totems don‚Äôt just have to serve me negatively. Rather, I can learn from the pain and better myself. It feels like I‚Äôm getting a snippet of the love and the warm hugs my mother can‚Äôt really give to me because of her mental illness and addiction."
