This is just my opinion, based on personal experience, in this area. I think it would be more beneficial for the way to convert these everyday-measurements should be encouraged until it become ubiquitous. 

Funny you mentioned languages, as making the measurements universal does remind me of the idea that everyone should just learn English to make things easier for the people who already know it, as opposed to because it aids communication, just like learning any widespread language. 

Coming from someone who works a trade that civilization consistently uses, doing these small conversions and using fractions for length, width, depth, etc. is essential. 

I don't know how many plumbing things work, but I probably should, so I'm not in the dark and helpless. How does encouraging (not even forcefully) building intelligence and skills make someone the villain, here? Suggesting that people are more capable than they behave isn't, by any means, calling them stupid or inferior.

Knowing that wouldn't make anything better, but would anything, reasonable? You have an infinite amount of feelings and experiences I'll never know about, and I don't think that you don't deserve understanding. People feel differently at different points in-time.

I really struggle on some of the depression/loneliness/anxiety subs to see just how many people seem to revel in this. It's not a game. Unless one's there, the haven't a clue what their life at-home is like. 

Some people are more self-destructive when they're alone; some experience the same when forced to participate in social situations (a family dinner/birthday party, for instance or going to the grocery store at a verrry busy time). 

If life (in any tangible or intangible) doesn't change in any aspect during a goddamn pandemic, then good for you.

And thank you for your novel; I appreciate you taking the time to lend me your thoughts and related struggle. No apology necessary. Getting used to being in that independent place of being the only person you ultimately have constant contact and varying levels of support. 

With not knowing whether we deserve such a fond gesture, I completely get that. Last night, I told my boyfriend how I really want to try to take all of the love and adventures we're more likely to experience and enjoy if I'm healthier. I told him how, an ex-girlfriend if mine always made me feel like she was guilt-tripping me, when in reality, she was very upset about me slowly destroying myself in front of her. 

So, ah fuck... I thought it would be this really big step to relay that new information to him, and tell him that I would never want him to feel that way, that sense of helplessness. How thoughts like that help me do things like clear my plate, because I know he really likes it when I do. His response was that at this point in his life he doesn't think anyone can make him feel the aforementioned way. That he wants me to do things because I want to do them, and that he'll always support me. 

I understand what he means, specifically to him, but it still felt like a punch to the kidneys. I cried silently and unseen by him. A big part of me thinks, ""Cool, fuck it! I can bring my own pathetic excuses for a dinner with me to eat at his place and put some in the freezer for later."" 

Yeah, he's in the dark. When trying to open up to him, his response  was that I could join him in exercising if I wanted, so I could just burn the intake of any unwanted calories. üòë
I could give him a wake-up call by either delivering my own little Ted-Talks about my hell brain, or handing him an ED-related memoir that I most identify with. I could also just do what he says he wants, which is for me to do my own thing. While I wonder what he would feel knowing fully well how I do, but I don't want to worry him unnecessarily.

antinatalism,fmip3zt,t1_fmi4ppp,1586114046.0,"Well, psychiatry isn't really meant to or supposed to be a hard-science. Studying mental-illness and abnormal behavior is far from simple, but there's been a pretty general consensus on what medical-depression is. Even before the DSM I was published. 
It's just a guide, like the ICD-10, that doctors use to try to find which treatment is best for a patient. It's written in black-and-white, but it's not necessarily used that way. Diagnoses and symptoms of mental-illnesses are kind of like measurements of sorts, different to each individual. 
This is just how I've come to think it, over the years. I'm very aware that I'm no scientist. There aren't formulas for things like explaining delusions, unique to the individual or a precise way to measure traumatization. 
People try to do what they can for others. 
Also, I quite like your username. You're completely right when it comes to the DSM being pretty arbitrary, and it is, and is super-subjective. It's like a map that lacks in different things (scale, roadways, elevation, etc.) depending on what you need to use it for.
