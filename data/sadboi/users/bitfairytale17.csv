It’s a weakness in methodology- and has been present for decades, and in my opinion- it is wrong to do. A way to look at it- when a Covid test is administered- decided upon by a medical authority that it is necessary- the percentage of those tests that pop positive are still far from ubiquitous positives. And that’s within a population suspected to have it, at the time of the test order. Extrapolate that premise to the way mortality is calculated- which is what the CDC has been doing for a very long time. Lumping all sorts of causes together, not properly dividing and identifying, and we get a result where we are supposed to believe 80k people die from flu infection that would be prevented from a shot. And that’s just not it at all.

ETA: to your question about the data of Covid, Covid + another condition-  that’s an attempt to show multiple probable factors in a death. The intent is good- but not when they are umbrella-d together under a too large umbrella. In my opinion- it’s a case of trying to answer too many questions with not enough data.
