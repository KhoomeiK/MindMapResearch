For me it's not about killing. Animals kill each other for food. I would prefer it if people were vegetarian but the whole meat thing is up for debate.

I do think some people have to live in apartments for financial or location reasons. They are entitled to quiet enjoyment of the property but I know in reality that that isn't how the world works. 

I really wasn't attacking parents in general but I do think that parents, like everybody else need to be considerate. I was waiting in an airport recently and some child was literally crawling all over me while the parents giggled at how cute it was.

On the hostility point, we have different world views but I think that's fine! My 'happiness' and 'contentedness' IS affected by my environment. If you have managed to achieve the ability to be happy and content in spite of what is going on around you, then congratulations, I'm pleased for you."

Just existing in the system we do it's near impossible not to be complicit in some aspect of what we, as a species, inflict. 

I couldn't live in the Middle Ages. I know that. I understand the point about relative suffering. I believe that the pig suffers enormously, even if it hasn't ever known anything else. There are behaviors or needs that are hardwired into sentient beings. Humans, dogs, pigs all have needs and those are intrinsic - in their genetic code. Not having ever known a different environment doesn't obviate those needs, so the pig will suffer because animals need certain things in order not to suffer.

Humans are absolutely herd driven. Our so called 'moral values' are inconsistent and arbitrarily applied. The idea that if an animal kills a human (have you ever seen 'Grizzly Man') it must immediately be executed sickens me. Whereas I could kill somebody's pet dog (never ever would) and would either get a fine or a light sentence. The arrogance of our species is incredible. We know that animals can feel fear and pain yet we have no compunction whatsoever about inflicting it on them to an obscene extent. 

As I said the word 'humane' or 'inhumane' makes me laugh. It intrinsically puts humans at the peak of morality and lack of cruelty whereas it's clear that no other animal inflicts the prolonged pain and suffering that humans do."

Also of course they're heavily invested in their children so their world view almost has to be positive. 

Parents are the biggest narcissists out there. They believe that their intense love of their children somehow makes them loving, selfless people (because they put another human being first, would die for their kids, etc). But they fail to intuit that loving your children is basically loving yourself. You created a creature that looks like you, contains half your genetic code and is most likely going to outlive you.

I'd look at it a bit like that - just a couple of weeks of feeling some 'pleasure' again before I go. But yeah, only if I knew for sure that I was going to end it in a matter of weeks.

That means you have to be awake for 8 hellish hours each day. Sleeping 22 hours a day sounds about right. I would say 24 hours a day but that's basically the same as being dead (would be fine too).  


Has anybody read 'my year of rest and relaxation'? It's about a young woman that decides to effectively put herself into a coma for a year. Unfortunately not very realistic to do oneself but appealing as hell in principle. Wish there were places that offered a sort of in between option between suicide and life where they would put you into a medically induced coma for say 20 hours a day. Then you could use the other 4 hours to walk around a bit to prevent your muscles atrophying, eat (intermittent fasting?!), catch up with anything else that you have a mind to.

I even have a similar plan too you in terms of just scoring a bunch of heroin (probably fentanyl if you're in the US but I guess that in this context that's probably actually favorable).  


Having said that, your plan is more likely to result in a fast spiral into heroin addiction than death (not sure if you've ever done opioids before). I haven't done H but have done Oxy and all I'll say is that if you don't die the first time, they'll probably at first make you think that it's worth sticking around for a bit longer but eventually drag you down into a new dimension of hell. You could argue that it doesn't matter if you're ready to die anyway and I'm kind of thinking that way myself but thought it was worth flagging the more likely outcome of your plan.

If the buyer does not receive goods or is not happy he won't finalise and will dispute. The market admin will then rule in favour of buyer (buyer will be returned money) or seller (seller will get money).

In terms of others stories, I can give you mine. Started using coke about 4 years ago. Unlike many here i just can't handle it. If i do even 0.5g i will have a comedown that lasts days or weeks and it's hellish. I have underlying severe depression and cocaine makes it 10x worse.

I ended up inpatient 4 times because of coke binges. Came very close to losing my job.

I have stopped now. I still do Ketamine. No comedown and actually helps depression. I'm not recommending it, just saying.

But yeah I have come really close to killing myself a few times on the long coke comedowns. Just the worst feeling in the world and i never want to go back there."
cocaine,f9ks30n,t3_e5mjfr,1575406741.0,You have your picture and daughter's picture on your profile. Are you sure it's a good idea to be posting this when if the babydaddy checked this forum he would see this and easily identify you?
cocaine,f9fo9gd,t3_e4wde0,1575281588.0,You wish your xanax was alprazolam? Lol if it's not alprazolam it's not xanax my dude. What the hell is it? Doxepin?

I just hate it (no offense to your Mom and possibly mine has done the same when i was a kid, who knows). If nothing else it's just so damn unoriginal. I want to know what these people are trying to convey. That they love their kid? Well, duh. That they think their kid is special? Duh again. 

By definition most people's kids are average. None of them seem to realise it though. ""Mom to two mediocre sons and one dunderheaded daughter."" I could admire that kind of profession."
childfree,f8t8ung,t1_f8t8km5,1574798305.0,"There's nothing wrong with that at all. I'm not even saying that in some cases these people's children aren't beautiful. 

It's just I don't understand why no parent seems, in internet posts aimed at anonymous strangers, to be able to just state they have kids without slipping beautiful in there. It's totally unnecessary but they do it anyway and I'm sort of interested in (but also annoyed by) the psychology."
childfree,f8t5x9q,t1_f8t27sr,1574796498.0,"Jesus, wtf. Can't they just say, ""Our daughter"". 

I'm lost, genuinely. These parents can get f**** as far as I'm concerned.

Having a kid has to be the lowest accomplishment I can imagine. If they raise a kid that turns into a great adult, I'll give them a pat on the back when their kid hits 25 or so."
childfree,f8t29m9,t3_e1zgt1,1574794233.0,"Thanks for the posts guys.

Reading some of the responses I think my main problem with this is saying it to a bunch of internet strangers and what they think using the word 'beautiful' achieves. If the aim is to make the point that their kids aren't terrible, I'm not sure it achieves that. Everybody says it so if the point is to distinguish their children from other children, it doesn't accomplish that. 

Often I read it in the context of, ""I have three beautiful children..... but I'm smoking crack on the down low"" or ""I have three beautiful children...... but I'm cheating on my wife/husband"". So yeah maybe it's just people in desperate, sleazy situations who need to actually remind themselves that there is something bright and shiny and wholesome in their lives."
childfree,f8t1zxx,t1_f8swrpi,1574794068.0,"So assuming they are just big on adjectives and can't just say 'I have two kids"", I would respect them so much if they said, ""I have three average children"" or ""I have three slightly dim children"". 

""My three BEAUTIFUL children"" just rubs me up the wrong way. 

Like the late great Bill Hicks said (something like) ""Your children aren't special. I know you think they. They're just not.""

And even if their kids were future Natalie Portman's or Brad Pitts, why feel the need to say it?! If people see their children they'll see that they are beautiful, whether inside or out."
childfree,f8t1oif,t1_f8t0xn9,1574793871.0,You're so right. And that's basically why parents love their kids so much. It's a 50% replica of them! This is contentious (although I'm in the right sub) and that's why I see it as almost a cheap or egotistical love.
cocaine,f8swqvl,t1_f8stevy,1574790813.0,"Ah sorry, I'm with you. I thought you had taken a drug test lol. My fault, misread it. Um, I don't know. That seems unlikely. I don't know if some of it just breaks down naturally?"

cocaine,f8bbaak,t3_e00sqr,1574432579.0,"Benzos. Not risky. First line treatment for overdoses. Keep it to 1 or 2mg Xanax/Klonopin.

Still shocked people have concern about this. It's not dangerous immediately after or even at the same time, let alone the day after.

If you mean beta blockers there's a theoretical risk of unopposed alpha stimulation but not a great evidence base for it. Anyway if you have benzos stick with those."
cocaine,f88fzyp,t3_dzlkje,1574354058.0,"Is his contention that 'deep learning' doesn't involve changes in brain 'wiring' or chemistry? If not then how is a change in wiring or chemistry not a disease. How do you define disease? 

Addiction may not be something you can see on an MRI but neither is depression (and I understand sometimes depressives show changes on fMRIs but not always). 

I don't really see the point of classifying it as 'deep learning' as opposed to a 'disease'. I think even those who view it as a disease believe there are things you can do to improve it. 

Just my opinion by the way OP, it's an interesting article to read."
cocaine,f82d8ur,t1_f82atfx,1574188953.0,"I think they're increasing mate, I guess just because cocaine usage has gone up but I believe the number of deaths last year was very high.

Yeah I love it when people talk about ODing just on a benzo. I think it would be pretty hard to do. Even combing opioids with benzos is done regularly in hospitals but the dosages are kept sensible. 

Well we can just sit back and continue to be amused by folks who have gone through 7g in 3 days and then are worried that taking 1mg Xanax might be dangerous (God bless them)!

I don't do coke anymore, not really because of the danger of sudden death but just because the comedown is so awful. And I don't mean the immediate comedown, I'm totally fine with that as I'll just take a benzo or Oxy. But then the next WEEKS for me are absolute hell. It's ridiculous, everybody on here just seems to suffer for a day or two. 

So I'm sticking to Ketamine. Went through 7g in 6 days and felt totally fine afterwards. I've found my drug."
cocaine,f827xfv,t1_f822rt5,1574185862.0,"I mean I just find it funny that people have no problem railing grams but are worried about taking a benzo. And I'm not judging because I've binged with the best of them but always, always took either a benzo or an opioid for the comedown. I know the opioids may be more risky but I would still like to know the mechanism of action that people believe will lead to a heart attack. 

As you say cocaine + alcohol is cocaethylene which is more cardiotoxic than alcohol. So it's obvious why that's dangerous. But nobody can say why taking 1 or 2mg of Xanax or Clonazepam is bad. It's just funny to me because everybody on here is probably taking the most dangerous recreational drug for risk of sudden death (maybe along with something like Nbome) but get terrified when it comes to benzos. Crazy."
cocaine,f81x90v,t1_f81wv9s,1574179356.0,Totally agree. The same opinion gets voiced time and time again. It just blows my mind that people think the combination is dangerous when as you say benzos are first line treatment for ODs. Ok with beta blockers you can argue (maybe) unopposed alpha stimulation but benzos? They're a really safe drug and only really dangerous when combined with CNS depressants like opioids.
cocaine,f81vn0j,t1_f81vdzw,1574178347.0,"I don't get this sub sometimes. It's totally fine with taking a drug in large quantities that is cardiotoxic, a sodium channel blocker, vasoconstrictor, etc but they're terrified of fucking benzos. It's completely misplaced."
ketamine,f81ex91,t1_f81etsn,1574164835.0,"Thanks man, appreciate the advice. I spend quite a lot of time abroad so that curbs my usage as no way do I want to risk trying to get stuff outside of the UK (drug laws are way stricter). But if I were in the UK full time I'm sure I'd be using every day. Got really bad depression so escaping into K-land is just too tempting."
ketamine,f81ecz5,t1_f81e70d,1574164163.0,"Thanks man, will do that. I'm pretty new to recreational use and can't believe how compulsive it is in terms of redosing."
