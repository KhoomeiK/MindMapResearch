My mother's friend has an heavily autistic child that has grown up being respectful and sweet because she has worked with her to get to that point and past issues she had. And she absolutely hates it when other parents with kids that have disabilities blame 100% of their child's behavior on the disability.. when in fact a lot if it could be remedied by working with their kid with patience, and hell, even just paying attention to their environment. Even worse is when people assume her kid never had their problems, when in fact it took a lot of work to get to that point. Routine, and patience really pays off. And although it can be hard, it can always get a little better with consistancy. Just because a child has a mental disability doesn't mean they should get away with hell. They need more guidance if anything. I really respect her as a mom."

We as people, especially anxious people focus on the negative. Including negative memories with feeling we've had, so we tend to just remember those situations. Just remember to focus on something else when that feeling comes. Crafting, drawing a doodle, anything to get your mind off of it can help a little. Everytime the thought pops into your head, make yourself picture something truly dumb/hilarious, and then find somthing to keep your attention. I tend to watch light hearted movies, or YouTube videos when I can't get something off my mind. I know it's hard to do, but it is possible! Hope I helped a little bit. ‚ù§"
