trashy,fp7fmx1,t3_gbjnmx,1588369726.0," Nobody seems to mention the fact that he is also stealing from Walmart. They don’t use the “you break it you buy it” policy so he is literally going in there and essentially vandalizing the store. Not to mention wasting all the environmental resources that were used in making said item.

iamverybadass,fj28zt0,t3_fabl6m,1582937575.0,"The “n” word is not what it used to be. As someone who grew up in Sac then moved to Utah ... that was one of the biggest culture shocks. The n word is treated like a swear word straight from the devils mouth out here when - ironically & LITERALLY - I’ve seen maybe 3 African Americans who actually grew up here. I’m white but it was just common language where I grew up. You could be black, white, Mexican- it didn’t matter. You were all n****s 🤣

Personally I take more offense to the word “colored” based on the dehumanizing value it has. However, I would 110% stand up for ANY African American who was being slandered with the n word in a derogatory way. I don’t say it anymore, but even when I did I never once forgot that it’s important to know your audience and not to say these things in public."
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fj27ntb,t1_fj1ujdd,1582936606.0,The thing is that I don’t think she is being intentionally fake.. her real and raw emotion comes out but then is so quickly masked like her subconscious is hiding it. People with BPD can be seen as mass-manipulators without the deceiving pretenses. Does that make sense?
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fizoyk4,t3_f8v4qp,1582869253.0,I think that she may have been in love with the “idea of being in love” and super caught up in “I’m 34 and should be married with kids by now” while also wrestling with “how will people look at us?” She feels the extreme need for social validation and I think she may have some issues with borderline personality disorder as she reallyyyyy struggles with expressing her emotions.
