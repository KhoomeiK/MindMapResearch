I agree with you there are social activists who are hypocrites, or who do horrible things, but I will counter that with the fact that all people do horrible things. If you spent all day reading about only crimes plummer’s had committed you would think plummer’s were horrible people. 

You have no concrete evidence aside from bias that the majority of social activists are not improving the world in their own way (aka setting up stem
programs for girls, proms for LGBT students, or scholarship programs for inner city youth)

unpopularopinion,fl526ml,t1_fl4x51k,1584826812.0,"I think everyone is trying to fight for what’s right. At many point in my life I could have been classified in the “virtue signaling “ group, not because I wanted moral high ground but because I had a world of belief that told me these beliefs were right/good. 

Understanding the complexities of issues often means backtracking your beliefs several times. For example if you support immigrants from Mexico, you might be defensive once someone starts calling them out for human trafficking, or calling them rapists. First you have to sacrifice your views to see the reality of the situation in Mexico and accept it, then you have to backtrack and see how that effects your other view points. Once you find those beliefs are not mutually exclusive, aka “immigrants are good for our nation AND we need to do something about the smuggling of sex slaves” then you have evolved your opinion, you have also admitted you were wrong about something. 

The issue is if you do this your whole life, you end up without a party or group. You can understand why certain policies work on one side and why certain work on the other. It leaves you constantly questioning your perspective. It’s hard to do, and lacks the satisfaction of sticking to your view point and feeling that “what I believe is right/good” validation. 

The only real thing I am sure of at this point is that money runs this world, and unless you can amount human suffering to a loss, it doesn’t matter. Even if it does equal indirect loss, if it gets in the way of short term profit it will not happen."

The fact that things changed one lifetime ago does not change hundreds of years of uneven playing field. 

Helping minority communities as a whole would be not only the right thing to do, but beneficial for our economy. 

As far as modern slavery, no one cares. Feminists are evil and all that. It’s horrible and we just have to hope those who do it go to a fiery hell. I’ve tried convincing people this is an issue and they just don’t care."
