Such broad, oversimplified generalisations (especially about subject matters of immense complexity) are harder to sustain the more information is factored into your models of the world.

BipolarSOs,fi6m1m0,t1_fi5u568,1582200638.0,">The primary reason bipolar often has a poor clinical course is due to anosognosia as a symptom of the illness. People feel better, or miss the mania, and go off their meds. But the outcome for those who are able to mitigate anosognosia is much better.

Exactly. Significant cognitive impairment and declining social adjustment is directly related to the number of recurring manic episodes. As you said, due to anosognosia, a very common symptom of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, most patients go off their meds at least a few times in their lives which worsens the prognosis and cognitive abilities vastly as time goes on.

>Because of the genetic component and the effect of an un/der medicated bipolar parent on a bipolar child, there's also often a personality disorder in the mix, which in my opinion is the biggest current gap in bipolar management.

That is correct although that applies to pretty much every psychiatric condition. Btw, I recently read a paper about BP2 having more comorbidites than BP1, which was new to me. 

&#x200B;

>As for BP1 vs BP2, most of my knowledge on long term disability is admittedly anecdotal from the BPSO community. Because of the typically longer cycle of BP1, the odds of getting someone to get effective treatment and stick with it due to longer cycles are better. And effective treatment diminishes the disability rate. 

Unfortunately, metadata says otherwise - even with life-long pharmacological and psychological treatment, the outcome for BP1 patients are worse than initially thought. Structural and functional neuropathological alterations are also more pronounced in BP1.

Here in Central/Western Europe, the UBI has been a topic of high interest in the general public for many years. In my country Austria, a citizen's initiative for a UBI of 1200€ monthly (~1341 USD) failed just last month. We already have a pretty solid social security system though.

In Northern Europe, Finland started a temporary ""UBI"" experiment in 2017, in which 2000 randomly chosen unemployed citizens received 560€ (~625 USD) per month, basically as a 2-year trial phase for the upcoming implementation of a nationwide UBI.
It ended with a complete dismissal of the planned UBI due to the ""underwhelming"" results (increased happiness and wellbeing but no significant changes in the employment rate).
I personally think it's bullshit because 
1) the way the program was designed was much closer to unemployment benefits than a UBI
2) considering the high the costs of living in Scandinavia, 560€/month is like good pocket money for an adult at best
3) the experimental design was flawed as FUCK: sample of n = 2000 in the treatment group (UBI) and sample of n = 178.000 (regular unemployment benefits) in the control group, different tax treatments between those groups, questionable analytic methods and interpretation of the findings, and so on.

BipolarSOs,fakjcgt,t1_faiswnw,1576168109.0,"I just finished reading your letter, and it really struck a chord with me. The events you described evoked an old familiar feeling, this omnipresent dread and horror that creep up your spine and you never lose because it is happening at a place where you're supposed to feel safe. My father surely had NPD traits besides BP1 as well, and was very violent and unpredictable. I don't think anyone who has not lived with someone who would unleash this kind of diabolic manic rage on them for years can understand how it can fuck you up for a lifetime. I'm sending you a virtual hug. Glad you're finally in safety.

That being said, my BP1 SO without NPD traits displayed similar disturbing behavior during his last and worst episode. He had extremely sinister, violent thoughts, and at one moment he screamed and threatened to beat me up, the next he paced around in circles all sweaty and laugh manically while muttering psychotic nonsense. The police had to take care of him in the end. Now that he shows only some traces of mania (thanks to his meds) now and then, the violent tendencies are completely erased.

When the disorder has progressed to a late stage  (several clear-cut, unmedicated manic episodes) and a episode unravels without psychiatric, psychological and medical care, it can get this bad.

Why did the court dismiss your letter? And how did your husband behave before this episode hit?

You must be still shaken up but focus on the new life before you. A home where you can feel safe and sleep soundly. Sounds rather nice, doesn't it."

Never an apology, never really addressing his actions, just goes straight to blame shifting and low-effort gaslighting. Calling me a shitty, abusive girlfriend when I lose my cool and ignoring the financial and emotional support I gave him during a time he treated me cruelly and even his family and friends abandoned him because no one wanted deal with his manic bullshit.

The recovery from a particularly bad episode involving a complete loss of reality can take several months, depending on its duration, even with meds. It's a painfully slow, uneven process in which the rage and delusions wane over time, suddenly flare up after few days of relative levelheadedness, only to fade away again.

Just stay patient and don't openly question any of his bizarre and very obviously wrong beliefs but also don't encourage them by agreeing with him. It's a fine balance and I know it's hard and terrifying at times. Best wishes to you both!"

Height of a 12-year old, ascites due to alcoholism, openly called herself a ""whore"", forced herself into the bathroom when he was showering and wore fake teeth. My SO, being a very tall, attractive man in his 30's, still found her extremely good-looking and appealing in his manic state. Gross. So please, please do not let your fiancee's random sex encounters affect your self-confidence, they say NOTHING about your qualities as a lover or partner. Or appearance. When crashing from manic delusions, there's shame and confusion.

That being said, mania or not, the consequences for the betrayed partners are real (STDs, broken trust, permanent worries about future cheating). You've been broken up only 3 months now, it's gonna take many more months to heal but you're on the right path. Dodged a bullet."

He won't just snap out of it, his sanity will recover slowly and the relapses into psychosis will be milder each time until you look back in surprise and realise how much closer you have come to normality.

I'm definitely wiser now than in the beginning and am ready to run for the hills should it get bad as the last time. I need to take care of my own mental health (suspected BP among other problems) and safety. My SO had a... pretty severe episode one year ago and is still recovering. It took ~2 months post hospitalization (January '19) until his bizarre delusions stopped and apart from short bursts of mania (luckily regulated by antipsychotics) he's been deeply depressed and lethargic. The scary fits of rage turned to irritability now after a few months. Giving up THC for CBD has helped surely. It's as if he has to re-learn how to function and think. He avoids to talk about what happened and barely remembers most of the things he's done anyway but I know he's terribly ashamed and confused. Regrets are there but his actions left big, gaping wounds in our relationship and I can't trust him anymore."
