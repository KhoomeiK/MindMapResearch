For people who want to do long term investing and didn't pick up at the lows in mid March buying here is crazy. Wait for another 30% off discount or larger before adding to your long term portfolio. Or learn to price average. If you don't know how to daytrade and most people dont stay out. The market will bleed you dry in these times. Good luck.

However, fatigue is a major problem for fibro from all I've read.  Fatigue in many ways is killer for me when my diesease is on an active cycle. I have found stims here and there do help.  Caffeine obviously helps. Pain is a shitty side effect with no good solutions really
 I've tried fentanyl patches and all the pills. They work for a time. I take them on and off with multi month breaks. I have no addictive personality so that helps with that.

Best advice is to keep looking for a doc that takes it seriously and keep going to appointments and voice how thing are working or not working and push for more. Otherwise they will dismiss you.  I don't have fibro but I have a rare condition that took 8 years to diagnose.  Mostly took Soo long because doctors saying your blood work/ tests are fine.

I still kept going though. I knew something wasn't right.  Turns out I was right. So keep pushing it sucks.  One a side note cymbalta or snri do help with fibro a bit. I'm not saying this to scare you but the doctors won't tell you how difficulty it can be to get off snri but it is not easy but for some they do wonders for their condition."

Tons of posts on this here. A lot of people do every 4th day such as does Monday dose day, Tuesday no dose (after glow day), Wednesday no dose (rest day), Thursday dose day.  Then the cycle repeats. That is called the fadiman protocol.

Then there is the stamets protocol 5 days on (dose) 2 days off (no dose).

I personally created my own method that works well which I call ramping-down. It works well for me. 3 days on 2 days off. Dose 1 Day 1 (0.3g), Dose 2 Day 2 (0.2g), Dose 3 Day 3 (0.1g), No Dose Day 4, No Dose Day 5. Repeat cycle at Day 1. I take Lions mane everyday.

I have been experimenting and this works well for me.  Mostly it feels like I am carrying the after glow of day 1 through day 3 and then no dose after glow for 2 days before large dose day 1 again.  I also like it because it saves me mushrooms.

Play around though find out what works for you. That is the interesting aspect of this stuff. No one has any real clue what is best so it's up to you to experiment and report back here to help others."

Maybe try psilocybin.  Drugs that cause stimulating effects tend to be more negative when they drop off imo. I always feel more down or burnt after being stimulated all day."
