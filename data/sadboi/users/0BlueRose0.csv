Me personally, whenever somebody asks me that, I reply with the same thing and brush off whatever they say afterwards. Just “calming down” or “stop thinking about it” or even the infamous “you have no reason to be anxious” doesn’t help anyone. I’ve had people tell me that I’m not diagnosed with anxiety, so I shouldn’t be so anxious. The best thing I can tell you is to ignore it as best as you can, and try to focus on something else.

PublicFreakout,et19itk,t1_eszkw5m,1562393906.0,"I remember a while back I had accidentally hit a girl with a basket ball. I went over to apologize, but one of her friends kicked me in the knee and the other girl was barely acknowledging my presence. I was like fine, sure, be dicks about it. 

The next thing I know, half a class of pubescent teens are holding back the girl I accidentally threw the ball at, who was repeatedly claiming that she was going to “Kick my Ass,” along with a few slurs that I don’t feel comfy saying. 

I guess she broke through because at some point while I was still standing there, she managed to land a hit on me. By that point I was aiming for her stomach, her eyes, and her throat, fully intent on making her immobile somehow, everything my father taught me in the event I did get in a fight. 

Eventually somebody tore us off, but we had to go to the assistant principal for my grade, who was an absolute dick. He took the side of the girl and didn’t bother trying too hard to let my parents know the situation, to which I had to secretly text my parents and slide food around the detention room, just so i wouldn’t be hungry while I was waiting to get picked up. 

Moral of the story: that zero tolerance policy is absolute bullshit, and it’s just an excuse for school to be lazy about discipling physical fighting. Why figure out who was the original offender, when you can just punish both people. 

The good news though is that those were the best 3 days of OSS I’ve ever had in my life. My parents made sure every day was fun for me, and after I got let out of school the first day we immediately went out for ice cream."

Self-care is a really important thing that usually ties in to confidence. If you can’t take care of yourself, mentally and physically, then you won’t be able to build up the confidence you desire. Like I mentioned earlier, even something as simple as cleaning your workspace or home can help you build confidence, or at the very least make you feel a bit better about yourself.

For first degree burns I usually run cold water underneath the burn area for about 5 minutes or so. It’s good to apply aloe gel to the area so that it keeps your skin from drying out, but I’ve heard regular moisturizer works just as well. You should cover the burn with some adhesive, like a bandaid if it’s small or some regular bandages, and check occasionally for infection, while also changing out the bandaid from time to time. 

If you’re worried about family, I don’t think the burn will show through the bandage. If they ask, a good response is probably “I skinned my leg” or something.

It’s still a good idea to get to a doc for a more professional diagnosis to give proper treatment, but this should hold her off till then.
