adultsurvivors,fh9vn8j,t1_fh78las,1581390664.0,"I’ve been going to therapy for 2 years now and it’s nice to have someone to talk to where they just actually listen, but even then I’m afraid that I’m being fake with my therapist or that I’m upsetting them by telling the I’m unhappy. 

My brain kinda turns it into this thing where when I tell my therapist I’m unhappy I’m afraid of them feeling like they aren’t doing a good job.

Which I know is ridiculous but I can’t shake it off"
adultsurvivors,fh9vg5e,t1_fh756ye,1581390533.0,Yes! Like there is no place to hide from these “fake” feelings
adultsurvivors,fh9vbye,t1_fh4oe40,1581390455.0,Sometimes I feel like I don’t want to ruin their mood or day with me expressing myself. I kinda just go along with whatever the mood in the room is
adultsurvivors,fh9v7hz,t1_fh4u7i3,1581390372.0,"Yes! This too! Especially at work I feel like so inhuman sometimes.

I am currently at that stage in my life where I don’t know what actions are from me or a result of my abuser.  And I also worry that if my current relationship were to fail, I wouldn’t be able to find anyone else because of my past or my lack of understanding myself."
adultsurvivors,fh9uty2,t1_fh49a67,1581390122.0,"I had the realization I don’t even know who I truly am because it seems like all of my interests came from my abuser aka my dad. Even the type of music I like.  So I completely understand how difficult it is trying to find oneself.  All I know about myself right now is that I’m unhappy and I guess that doesn’t sound very good, but  from acknowledging that fact about myself I’m positive I can into being happy"

I hope it gets easier for you too, makes me feel less alone in feeling this way"

relationship_advice,f35utd7,t1_f35uf9k,1570691904.0,There’s like two versions of my boyfriend like a jekyll and hyde kind of thing. He can be so sweet and so understanding and then he can be the complete opposite. And I know that I love him and I want to be with him but sometimes I do feel like for my well being he’s very damaging. he’s become my best friend but at times my worst enemy. And the main reason I put up with so much is because I hold on to that good in him if that makes any sense.
relationship_advice,f35ucuf,t1_f35u7wi,1570691257.0,"Yeah you’re right, I’m going to talk to him and tell him I’m not to keen on the idea. I’m always so cautious on upsetting him that I do put my needs and comfort aside"
relationship_advice,f35u9nf,t1_f35tmh2,1570691134.0,There was an occasion when after a therapy session I was very drained and (for lack of better word) triggered and he knew that. That night he wanted to have sex and I told him I didn’t want to because of how intense my EMDR session went. He got very upset with me turned around and watched Netflix. I went to the bathroom and cried and I felt that there was something wrong with me. I went back to the room and had sex with him but I was completely disconnected the entire time. He has been selfish and my mind makes connections with that if we don’t have sex he’ll leave. But you’re right I’m going to talk to him and be honest to hm about it. He’s talked about introducing toys in the past and I’ve told him I wasn’t too keen on it but I need to be more blunt about it
relationship_advice,f35tzsv,t1_f35thpq,1570690764.0,"I’ve been going to therapy for a year now and I have been doing some EMDR sessions but we’ve just begun to touch the surface with that.  I know sex toys can be a great tool, but I guess I’m at a state where it’s still a “taboo” for me personally"

adultsurvivors,eu5fcpo,t1_eu55ykj,1563476367.0,"I have been going to therapy, but until recently it’s like all these things are adding up. 

It makes sense that I’m looking for something I didn’t get with my dad.  But I also know I don’t want to date anyone that reminds me so much of him. They are almost identical in behavior sometimes it’s insane

I love my boyfriend but I just feel so disconnected to the point where I’m not hearing him when he talks or even acknowledge his presence."
adultsurvivors,es4fv29,t3_c5u94p,1561583893.0,"For me, I want to have sex. But when it comes to the moment my body shuts down, especially when my partner says certain phrases that take me back to a moment. Sex then becomes painful because I get to much in my head and I tense up. My partner has been amazing with me in the sense that he’s patient but it’s completely frustrating because it’s like my dad took my ability to experience sex like any normal person."
