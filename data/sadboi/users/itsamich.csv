I personally feel that it's always best to start slow with a new substance. I took 3.5g for my first shrooms trip, and I was convinced I was in hell for 3 days. But I have psychotic depression it turns out, so it's not what mentally sound people would experience, at least not for that long.

Similar thing happened to me on acid: took 2 tabs for my first time and did not end up enjoying the trip. I take it you only have an eighth total? If so, you could try a single gram at first and save the 2 and a half left for another time. Now if you had some benzos on hand in case the trip turns south, doing an 8th wouldn't be risky."

The only ghb I've used was from 1-4b, but I'd say I prefer etizolam. I feel that it's a lot more clear minded than alcohol and ghb, but don't let that make you take too heavy a dose. Keep a close eye on how inebriated you are. You'll feel it most in your vesitibular sense."

opiates,ewp3o5k,t1_ewo9src,1565632769.0,"Yeah the neuroscience behind it is pretty interesting. I had pharmacogenetic testing done to see which medications I'm compatible with. My Î¼-opioid receptor (OPRM1) A/G type is less prone to effects from opioids than those carrying two A alleles. As a result, heroin doesn't make me feel euphoric/happy like it does to some, but it does provide a sense of comfortability/anxiolytic effects. That's probably part of why I survived a gram of bth. I didn't get hit with narcan for 8 hours after I shot up."
opiates,ewnlh45,t3_cp36nq,1565581800.0,"After a gram of tar, I barely came to hours later from two doses of narcan. I don't remember it very well, but I was still pretty zonked out and didn't experience the instant withdrawal. I only felt an urge to go back to sleep, which the paramedics had to continuously try to stop. I wasn't happy to have come back, but it wasn't a harsh experience.

I don't really get the euphoric rush from h due to my A/G opioid receptor genotype, nor do I get much withdrawal symptoms other than heightened anxiety and trouble sleeping. This could explain why it wasn't too riveting of an experience to get hit with narcan after an overdose."
AskReddit,ewa0xyz,t1_ew9yois,1565234562.0,"I'm typically able to distinguish it from reality, and my medication also takes care of the majority of it. It can still be hard to hear though, and knowing it's a manifestation of how I view myself isn't exactly comforting. 

I didn't know it was a hallucination for the longest time; I remember thinking I was hearing my boss talk shit about me everyday when I was working as an assistant contractor, and I wasn't sure why he wouldn't just fire me. It was only months later that I was diagnosed as being on the schizophrenia spectrum; I'd only been diagnosed with MDD and generalized anxiety before.
