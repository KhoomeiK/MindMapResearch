Just posted this today to r/suicidebereavement

It’s been 8 months

In eight months a lot happens. So many important milestones that are missed, holidays, birthdays. Your daughter turned 5 and is blossoming in pre k. Your son misses you so much and is afraid of forgetting you. He’s 7 and has had to grow up so much to protect his little sister. 

Your wife struggles. She’s dating someone special and I think he will be around for the long term. I’m happy for her and the kids. Does that make me a shitty aunt to you? You’ll never be forgotten but she needs happiness. Your kids deserve to have a happy mom and a man that they can look to in your absence. 

Your family has changed so much. Your grandparents moved across the country to get away from memories and heartache. Your brother is working at your old company and thinks about how you’d be working together if you had stayed here. 

Your dad has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for wanting to die with you. I’m hopeful that we can help him but I’m scared. I can’t handle another death like yours. The pain I’ve had over the past 8 months has been horrible. Like nothing I’ve ever felt and never want to experience again. 

I moved up north like we had planned. I can’t believe I don’t get to see you. I’m three hours away now and see your kids all the time. 

Eight months down with a lifetime to go. Love you and miss you so much."

 - The salesman and I had a miscommunication on when I would come to do paperwork. I texted him that I’d be there around 11 and when I showed up at 11:15 I was told I would have to wait two hours while finance person was on a conference call. I was frustrated because I would have to leave and figure out coming back again and had an appointment in between. The salesman got shitty with me. 

- Then there was an issue with my reverse camera and the GM said he’d make sure I got a rental for that day and when I arrived at the appointment no call had been made and they didn’t have a car for me to use so I had made a wasted trip and had to reschedule the appointment. No apologies at all. 

I guess I’m frustrated that this process has not been smooth at all. I’ve purchased a house with less complications."
