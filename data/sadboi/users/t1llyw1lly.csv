AskReddit,fcjcyee,t1_fchikyn,1577683376.0,Exactly!! My husband and I both have very good jobs. We are killing it and are very career focused AND we smoke every day.

Anxiety,f4jy8ca,t3_dkp7l8,1571629095.0,I feel like I’m not making any progress and I desperately want to change my life completely because of it.
Anxiety,f3sk7lk,t3_dhskja,1571104180.0,Yes mine physically hurts. The chest pain and just the constant mental worrying gives me migraines. It’s been worse lately than it has been in a long time.
Anxiety,f3sjzuf,t1_f3rx53d,1571104082.0,Thank you for saying that- it means a lot.
Anxiety,f3qjtnd,t3_dhjdml,1571075900.0,"I needed this so bad today. I just came back from vacation and in a panic attack this morning I lied about a flat tire and they caught me. Luckily because I’ve been performing so well at work they gave me another chance and just sent me home for the day. I finally opened up and told them about my anxiety, owned up to my mistake and said it wouldn’t happen again. Yet I can’t stop beating myself up for how I could be so stupid and lie to cover anxiety."
Anxiety,f2vdvxy,t3_dedezt,1570450931.0,That’s a good idea! Thank you
Anxiety,f2vdtg6,t1_f2ui11w,1570450897.0,I do have a camper and when I’m in that I’m perfectly fine. This trip is vacation which you would think would calm my anxiety but at night is when the anxiety gets bad.
