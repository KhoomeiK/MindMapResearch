bipolar,fqnaxje,t1_fqn97tu,1589491647.0,"I think I had something similar last year, I had a manic episode with psychosis and I spent about 5 months on it. at first I thought the voices were people around me because it was like a crowded subway noise, with the passing of time the voices decreased and I started to think that God was talking to me in my ear or in my room. I needed a lot of therapy and risperidone to understand that this was not real.

but today I have, from time to time, some memories of those moments, I try to use the techniques of therapy to not fall into the hole again."
