I can digest the reason why they removed the scene of Hulk busting out of from the Hulk busting armour in Infinity War (it broke the consistency of loss for the finale according to the Russos)... But in endgame I was really disappointed that they transformed him into Prof. Hulk off screen with a lame explaination of 18 MoNtHs iN gAmMa a lAb. Then again when he wielded the Gauntlet to bring everyone back, the gamma radiation should have made him more powerful and transformed him into the angry hulk we all love but... instead it just wounded his arm."
