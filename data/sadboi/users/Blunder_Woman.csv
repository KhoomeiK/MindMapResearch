BPD,fm0f04a,t3_frzay2,1585655712.0,"I think this is pretty common for borderlines - my Husband comes from a family where this kind of roasting is totally normal and done with absolute love, but after almost a decade and a half together, I still have to be reminded that he's not being mean when he does it. He always says ""I wouldn't say any of it if it were true, would I?""

A therapist I had a while back said that borderlines have a problem which is like bad wiring on a motherboard. Normal people go:  


EVENT > THOUGHT > EMOTIONAL REACTION

(event being something that someone says or does that we perceive as negative)  


Whereas bordeerlines tend to go:

EVENT > EMOTIONAL REACTION > THOUGHT

We don't have the same filters and layers of emotional protection that others do, so things cut us to the quick before we've even given ourselves a chance to have a rational thought about the situation. 

I've worked really hard in the last few years to think before I react, and I still fail a lot of the time, but I found knowing this about the order we process things really helpful for making me see that my reactons are often unreasonable."

You're young and this is a very new relationship, so there are way more reasons for you to cut and run than to stick around. 

However, I just want to remind people that she's a human being and while you're all conjuring images of bunny boilers, this person has suffered many traumas which have sadly shaped her personality. She's in need of help and kindness. It's not your problem, at this stage, but whatever you decide to do, please be gentle."

A diagnosis is like ammo, it helps you to work out how you should be treated, but it feels like about 50% of MH professionals are incredibly dismissive of a BPD diagnosis."

I don't speak for everyone, but as a mother, I couldn't ask for more than that. I want a partner who understands that the kids will ALWAYS come first, and the same for him.

BPD,farz0vu,t3_eaea34,1576321713.0,"My therapist once showed me two diagrams, one of how a neurotypical person processes things and one for how a person with BPD usually processes things. 

For the normal person, it goes:

Stimulus > Thought > Emotional Response

Whereas with BPD it goes:

Stimulus > Emotional Response > Thought. 

It's like having a production line in a factory where things happen in the wrong order because we're programmed to respond with emotion before we've even thought about what's happened.

I still have issues with reacting before I think, but sometimes it helps to remember that it's happening and give yourself a second to re-evaluate my reactions."
