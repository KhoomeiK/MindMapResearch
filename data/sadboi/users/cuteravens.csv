detrans,fquj5uo,t1_fqugxuz,1589659789.0,"i have a few hobbies but nothing gets my mind off stuff for more than like ten minutes idk. I would love to help people, or work at an animal shelter but im applying for a job right now, if that doesn't come through i will probably apply at a shelter. When i talk to my friends im always asking how they're doing, offering emotional support, trying to help them with whatever currently sucks. I do learn about them as well, i ask like what they do, whats up with them whats new idk. I am very bad at boundaries, i think i give more than i take for most people unless im pushing them away which i might do too much. I do have a therapist, but its online and he messages me like every two days which is very annoying. I dont know the next step, aside from maybe getting a job but that's it."

detrans,fqrimra,t1_fqr9851,1589585104.0,"Its okay because im okay with it. I hate myself for everything thats happened, i feel like i let it happen but im not doing that anymore. I also hate my body a ton, the hormones help but its not enough. Im saving for some facial surgery. My friends are supposed to support me but they don't, they get mad when i actually talk about how i feel. I take hormones to treat the dysphoria, but they aren't like my identity, they don't make me trans. I haven't really given up, i just dont care much to live, its just what ive chosen. Im still trying for things but im not gonna see lots of my plans come to fruition and thats fine, ill do what i can for now. Thats what ive been trying to say tho, im not letting myself be a pushover anymore, i fight back more than i ever have now, im not weak like i was, at least on the outside where people will be able to hurt me. But inside im fucked i guess."
