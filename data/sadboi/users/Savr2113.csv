I guess it’s a family shame that my mom abused me and they don’t want people to know. I don’t think I should say anything that she could use against me though, she loves to say how horrible people treat her. Although it would be hilarious since she’d be so shocked. This is the first time I’ve found my voice when it comes to her ridiculous behavior so she isn’t used to me speaking up."
JUSTNOFAMILY,eyqtir0,t1_eyqqzuk,1567353168.0,"Thank you that means a lot!
I’m pretty much over my mother’s denial. She’s used drugs as a way of covering up her involvement and I know she’ll never change. There was an investigation after my arm was broken. I’m pretty sure she placed all the blame on her gf during her time in court. My mom only had to take parenting and anger management classes, then after she was allowed supervised visits with me. Ive cut my mother off for good and now I’ll probably do the same with my grandmother. 
I’m just worried they won’t allow me to see my brother because of it."
