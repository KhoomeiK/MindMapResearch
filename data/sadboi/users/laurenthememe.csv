truscum,fr5v8el,t1_fr5qm8c,1589915227.0,"> I took some time to research it now. I never am a big fan of going back to old things, because it is hard to get every detail and I also always want to give my own two cents, but that is difficult without being there at the time. But I researched it and it doesn't quite surprise me that the whole discourse started because a cis girl pretended to be trans on tumblr. It's sad how big of a problem can start with just an idiot being an idiot....

The whole discourse is older than that, the tucute vs truscum is a fresh coat of paint. This goes back to like the 80s, if not earlier. 

> But I personally do not see an issue with a person who is not directly affected by an issue still understanding it and trying to help people out, which is my goal.

help by BOOSTING the voices of trans people. Not by moderating them. Going and moderating a trans community while punching down on nonbinary people (And I do NOT trust cis people to handle the issue of the vast majority of cis people calling themselves trans tactfully in a way that does not impact the valid trans nonbinary people. Even kept within the community, we've done a mediocre job at this). Like in so many places on reddit I can find cis men making transphobic comments going ""hurrhurr helicopter, pronouns are fart/poop"" but with the mockery aimed at all trans people, but we're supposed to trust you to nuance the areas accurately? It's like when cis people make jokes on /r/tgcj You can say you understand the jokes, the spirit of them, the intent, how they're ironic and really just mocking stuff people say about tgcj, but it would still be completely reasonable to not wanting you to make those jokes.

> I am a person who is really concerned with the well-being of others. Not intentionally, that is just how I am. It gets very problematic when I see people in need, donated money every time I saw Australian wildfire donation calls because I couldn't stand not helping. I believe this community has the goal of helping people, which is a good cause that I want to support the way I can./

Do you support the cause regarding Australian wildfires by trying to address the community's requested needs (donations etc) or by assuming a leadership position where you try to manage the community as far as acceptable areas of discourse goes? 

> Now, is there something I can do to help you feel less uncomfortable with me being on the team?/

I mean, no, not really. I saw this as an actually trans community where cis people didn't cause voices to be censored. Again, not you personally,  but this decision will make me less likely to participate in this subreddit in the future."

GCdebatesQT,fr542eq,t1_fr538o3,1589902134.0,"//My rebuttal stands. If women don't have euphoria about their female characteristics, then the feeling you have that you interpret as meaning you are female is a male feeling. A male's desire to have female characteristics.//

Another way of looking at it is that gender identity refers to the set of gendered (biological) characteristics you're most comfortable with. This does not imply a minimum like 'euphoria'. I just thought that off the top of my head so I haven't put a whole lot of thought into but that seems reasonable enough to me. 

I will say, and I hope this doesn't come across as unnecessarily aggressive, you're assuming your conclusion. In your view, I am a male and one's personal experience doesn't have to do with gender. I get the view. A GC interpretative framework is going to filter the info I've given and of course say ""the feeling you have that you interpret as meaning you are female is a male feeling. A male's desire to have female characteristics.""

We're all well-versed in the ideological differences here. The OP is literally specifically asking QT to explain the difference between gender identity and personality (With the implication, I'm assuming, that we fail to distinguish the two) specifically addressed to QT. I think my answer sufficiently answers that and distinguishes the two in a QT framework. If you want to reinterpret what I said in a GC framework, obviously it's going to reach a different conclusion. If you were to ask me ""Why use the QT framework over a GC framework"", whether or not you would agree with it I would probably argue more about the fact that I'm phenotypically interpreted as female. If you want to see GC takes on the difference between gender identity and personality, I suggest making a thread ""GC: What's the difference between gender identity and personality"". If you want to see reasons to use a QT viewpoint vs GC viewpoint, those threads are a dime a dozen so I suggest looking at one of those."

The truscum vs tucute thing is important to me and I'm passionate about it, but that's because I'm a trans person. I appreciate cis allies, but I would be lying if I said I didn't feel a bit of discomfort at cis people taking a stand on the definition of trans people against trans people, regardless of whether or not that cis person is right. Like, let us call that out. Sure, support us/boost our voices but trans people inaccurately describing what it means to be trans is definitely something for other trans people to call out, not cis people. 

I'm also uncomfortable about a cis person modding a trans community not even knowing how this has historically ended in disaster. I'm also uncomfortable with you saying ""Hey give me a chance and just call me out when I mess up"" like anyone really wants to give you emotional labor if you were to moderate in a way that felt tonedeaf to the issues. 

I'm also uncomfortable with you straight up admitting that you're going to take 'a benefit of the doubt' approach. Cis people giving benefit of the doubt to things trans people call transphobic and making devils advocate arguments is something I think we're extremely tired of to the point that it's sorta a punching bag meme. 

Not that my comfort or feelings are important or anything, but I do think the spirit of these criticisms are something that need to be addressed. And I'm not really sure why you would want to really address those, ergo dig your feet into the position, instead of just being an ally."

You clearly don't, since I haven't said that makes me 'feel like a woman'. Those are your words, not mine. 

If cis women not feeling euphoria is some sort of rebuttal to me interpreting my dysphoria/euphoria as being female (for all functional purposes), I'm gonna say I feel like you've not justified that and that I can reasonably dismiss it as non-sequitur unless you expand on that. 

//The point GC women keep making is that we don't walk around 'feeling like women' so when men tell us that they feel like women we find it ridiculous.//

You're right, it is men saying those ridiculous things. I'll concede that. More specifically, they're straw men."

//A transman doesn't know what it feels like to be a man, and a transwoman doesn't know what it feel like to be a woman. //

So women and men have unique feelings that are quintessentially 'like a man' and 'like a woman'. Please enlighten. Can you describe your 'feeling like a woman'? Can you tell me, since in your view I'm male, what part of me is 'feeling like a male'?

Whether or not you agree that that is NB dysphoria vs sex dysphoria seems to me to be a separate discussion. If they do happen to have sex-based dysphoria, that would make them trans and by definition not appropriating when they call themselves trans. Whether or not someone mislabels their dysphoria does not mean that they don't have dysphoria. 

Alternatively, their dysphoria is NB dysphoria, in which case their treatment of it, or desire to have treatment of it, by medical transitioning (HRT, surgery, etc) that would also make them trans. 

So in summary, NB people can prove they transitioned and it doesn't matter if they can prove 'sex' or 'nonbinary' exists

i also want to give a reminder that before the 20th century we didn't really have any empirical biological evidence of the binary transsexual condition either, and there was a time where activists/allies supported us before that. Like gender identity disorder isn't some schrondinger's medical condition where it only exists once its diagnosed lol. I do think a reasonable view that is that perhaps if you could put a brain on a scale from 1 - 10, where 1 is a completely 'female' brain and 10 is a completely 'male' brain, nb people might be like 4-7. I don't think it's unfathomable to hypothesize that people in that 4-7 range might have dysphoria from both of the binary sex's sexually dimorphic characteristics, and I think people who experience that dysphoria from both sides and then desire medical transition as a way of combatting that dysphoria, and then receive discrimination against them regarding those desires and their implementation, those guys belong in the trans space.

truezelda,fpf2mxa,t3_gcr47m,1588560349.0,"the more I look into it the more I'm convinced that the contents of the Great Plateau used to surround the Castle.

some facts

- We know the castle can be moved. From BOTW2

- We know that fissions in the ground can be created around the castle. (See child to adult era in OOT and the resulting abyss surrounding ganon's castle) A fission occurring will typically push some other land mass up or down

- On top of the plateau, the ruins certainly show this to be a lively area before calamity ganon. We have the Eastern Abbey, the area around the Oman Au shrine. 

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXI553QVcAACiqr?format=jpg&name=large
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXI553PU8AEYgnZ?format=jpg&name=large
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXI553FU0AMSYru?format=jpg&name=large

The Temple of Time, while tucked in its own little spot,  was clearly not far from town. Just like in OOT.



- We also know this as an area that the Royal Family knows in-depth. Zelda, in spite of exploring much of the world as something new to her, instantly knew to bring Link to the Shrine of the Resurrection. The King seemed to have indepth knowledge of the area as well. He clearly understood the Temple of Time to be significant and even understood it as specifically the central point that the 4 plateau shrines 'intersect' at. 

- Looking at the land surrounding the Great Plateau. We see unidentified ruins incorporated into the wall of the plateau itself. On both the north and south side, we see walls incorporated into the plateau itself; they are so high that they only have ingame parallel to Hyrule Castle. Nothing else compares. I also don't think you can argue that the walls were built to defend the Great Plateau, as we plenty of windows filled with dirt. I also don't think this was a structure that has remained where it's at but has fallen apart, because a lot of the walls are standing strongly but are just filled with dirt and don't really make sense to have been engineered there in the first place. (None of the ruins, when compared to another, seemed to indicate a full building was there at some point). Picture of the north side of the plateau - https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXI552rUcAA8x5f?format=jpg&name=large



- and we also know  of the gatepost town ruins which are referred to as an 'an up-and-coming place with lots of folks moving here. But then the monsters drove everyone out."" So it was a populous, bustling town. Behind it lies basically a giant wall of ruins that are structurally similar to the Castle. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXIx3sFVcAEpyte?format=jpg&name=large 

- I also think it's worth noting that the ruins of the general area (I think its fair to count the North wall and the South wall of the plateau as one general area since those are clearly parts of the same 'set' of structures) makes for the widest-spanning set of ruins in the game by far, which lines up very reasonably with it originally being a capital city.

Theory summary -  giant land mass appeared in between Hyrule Castle and Hyrule castle town/temple of time, etc, which pushed up and formed the Great Plateau, in which Hyrule Castle town was on.

this leaves the Hyrule Castle town around the BOTW Hyrule Castle was built to replace it. This also suggests the Hyrule Cathedral as a replacement for the Temple of Time (which explains why Death Mountain is behind it, like Death Mountain was behind the Temple of Time in OOT, but why BOTW Temple of Time is nowhere close). This also explains why gatepost town was so popular - It's basically a former capital, of course it's going to be a bustling city.


I'm taking a few creative liberties here but I think overall this theory gives some pretty good explanatory power to the ruins."
truezelda,fpe0190,t1_fpdwg27,1588537653.0,"i mean in the adult timeline of OOT we clearly see a fission in the ground between hyrule/ganons castle and the rest of the town. we also know from BOTW2 the castle can 'move' (though we don't know the full extent of it)

we also know that there are ruins that we don't know much about in the areas surrounding the temple of time and that its located pretty close to a cliff, and on that cliff we see what looks like ruins of a castle wall imo. it very well could be that the castle moved from next to the temple of time to its botw location, and so the hyrule town was rebuilt around it. 

another possibility is that that is a new temple of time. possible ways of disproving the 'castle moved' theory is that you can clearly see death mountain in the background of the temple of time in oot, and that positioning only makes sense if we consider oot temple of time somewhere east of botw hyrule town.

on the note of theming, we actually already saw this to a degree - for example most of the electricity puzzle shrines are in the gerudo valley region, and obviously the camel divine beast lol i cant remember the name is lightning themed to the extent that you fight the lightning blight there, deal with eletricity puzzles there, deal with lightning obstacles, etc etc

i will be gatekeep-y when it comes to 'trans people' that dont want to transition. (i dont mean people that want to but practically are not able to due to health/closet reasons). when you have someone who would never transition even if they were perfectly healthy in a supportive environment with the spare money to make it work, but then they choose not to transition, how is that trans? that feels like appropriation to me."

ok i promised i wouldnt like debate but i did wanna leave one open ended comment - i would find it important to distinguish between ""why i should be in womens spaces"" vs ""why i should (not) be excluded from womens spaces"" and the argumentation i offered would be in the latter category, specifically a rebuttal to the argument posited in the OP, not in itself the prima facie justification to be in womens spaces."
GCdebatesQT,fnjytgm,t1_fnjv169,1587010280.0,"i dont really have the energy to make a full argument, but if you were interested in an argument on trans women 'being the exception', if pressed my thoughts on the matter is more of trans women, while of course getting some sort of male privilege /socialization is going to be a thing for someone AMAB, the fact that we transition and obviously make a best effort to undo that is a good argument as to be an 'exception' (I disagree with the framing of 'as an exception' also)  julia serano has a decent twitter thread on this https://twitter.com/JuliaSerano/status/1063176877055954944


as my own personal example, when i think to my childhood of male socialization, i remember being teased ""you walk/sit like a woman, fucking f*****"". i remember being so fucking confused and crying my butt off at the homophobia i received when i realized i liked guys, and then the subsequent homophobia i received when i was told ""arent you worried that other men wont find you attractive since you dont act 'manly'. those locker room/bathroom discussions of saying disgusting things about women? i remember men teasing me that they 'caught me staring' at them and being afraid of me sexually assaulting them and frankly i got a lot of stuff from cis men for being in their spaces as i do now from GC women for being in our spaces

obviously all experiences vary and i can definitely, especially career wise, look at how ive benefited from male privilege in the past. but do i believe that ive experienced this privilege the same way your average cishet man experiences male socialization? no, i really dont. 


anyways, thats what you get from me on this. if you got some questions ill try my best to answer but im probably not the sort to get riled into a full on debate, full disclosure. i work a lot already and this whole time ive been typing this i was thinking ""man i could be playing zelda instead"" lol. i know you may not, and probably don't, agree with my takes, but i hope ive at least shown that an argument where im the 'exception' (still dont like that framing) can be held by a trans woman that you can at least look at and say ""ok, obviously this person genuinely believes what she's saying and isn't trying to farce something together"""

i think this is an unfair level of emotional labor to request from firstfroyo given the context of this sub. I don't mean to be nosy, but I think you can make your original argument, that basically the statistics regarding male violence don't have to write a narrative regarding trans women without resorting to this.
