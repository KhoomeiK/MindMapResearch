I’m a girl but have almost the same body type, as does my dad (he’s 70 and wears suspenders though lol). I always was worried that I’d look like a dweeb in high waisted pants. I gave them a shot and I will never ever go back!!

Tips:
- look for material that stretches. The more stretch the merrier. They’re not gonna be comfy at all if they don’t stretch

- **you don’t have to wear them up to your nips** lmao. Measure yourself starting midway between your belly button and your hip (should be about the widest part around). That’s a great place to wear them to make you look more slim and put together

- make sure the crotch fits. Not too tight, not too saggy. 

- I’d say straight leg pants would work best for you. Helps make you look slimmer and more put together [visual](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/72/c2/90/72c290382bae8390b93c00f6d3ab4eb8--perfect-jeans-muscular-men.jpg) 

You have the advantage here with higher waisted pants. Since you have a long torso, the pants can shorten it to make you look more proportional. As a bonus, it’ll help avoid accidental stomach or buttcrack shows"

Not sure if you're a minor or not but either way it should help if nothing else does

For healing:

\- Make sure the edges are as close together as possible. [SteriStrips](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-wound-closure-adhesive-strips/ID=prod6169539-product) are amazing for this. 

\- Put neosporin on them and keep them clean and covered as best you can for 24h straight. (change the bandage after 12h). After that, do the same thing but leave it open to air at night. 

\- When it's completely closed and any scabs are gone, keep them moisturized. Bio oil or Vitamin E oil are great for scars

The NPs and doctors I work with will just ask if you’re seeing a therapist or psychiatrist and will refer you to one if you’re not. 

I know not all doctors/healthcare workers are as courteous, so just know you’re able to have the exam done (esp a physical) without a parent in the room (“it shouldn’t take long” “I’m mature enough to go in by myself” “I’m not comfortable undressing in front of you” “I’ll come get you if I need you” etc). If you can’t avoid it, try to tell the nurse or MA “please don’t let the dr mention my scars” if you get a second alone. If you don’t get a chance, tell your parents you’re going to the bathroom while you’re in the exam room. Go over to the nurses station instead and try to let someone know. 

I know going to the dr sucks anyway, but we’re on your team always. We can be pretty sneaky when it comes to not mentioning things or bringing things up but not making them obvious (asking if you’re seeing a mental health professional and saying it’s just a standard question we have to ask)
