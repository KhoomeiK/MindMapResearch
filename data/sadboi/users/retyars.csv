Let’s take ours at the center of our galaxy, if you were to look at B from earth, they would be frozen but if *theoretically* B could see back out, earth would be passing at like 1000 years/1 year earth time or something along that. (Only possible example I can even think of in terms of observing a different gravitational field- and on a smaller level idk how it would be visually to A looking at B, I’m sure that at the instant one would pass over such a field of gravity, the rate at which time will be constant would be different than A, but constant so I’m guessing like just slightly sped up or slowed down)

However I don’t understand how it would work out confidently without taking a lot of things into account- like how it would look on a live feed on the person with a camera/telescope and an observer at the same time."
