raisedbynarcissists,fjbifpy,t1_fjbfa27,1583193992.0,"My mother 100% indeed feed everyone BS about me. In fact there are a couple times I remember she completely made up something that didn't actually happened. I remember think WTF because I KNEW I'd be getting in trouble. 
It's pretty disturbing when I think back, my mother thoroughly enjoyed when people yelled and disrespected me. She would smile and was all smug about it. There was one friend of my mother who was preasant in my life until I was 14, she did terrible things to me, sometimes it was purely out of her own twisted enjoyment she got out of seeing me distressed. Anyway basically my mother Always ""reported"" to her if you will. My mother loved watching someone treat me like that. My theory is that in her head it's ""see, I'm not the only one who thinks xyz"" 
I got slightly of topic, but I bring this up because the one interesting thing about my mother is she does divert from the typical narc when it comes to talking highly of me, or manipulating people into think it was a warm loving home. Like I said above she genuinely enjoyed telling people horrible things about me when if not true because she liked to see them scream at me. It really pisses me off how she let anyone and everyone disrespect me, I mean it was to the point where my sister's friend who did it and one time even my sister's friend's mom, like wtf? It was seriously a free for all. 

Another thing is she actually didn't mind incriminating herself and telling people the horrible things she did. She once told my SIL that she would hide food from us. (Mostly me) like unm....that's not how you get people to think you're a good parent. 
This does confuse me a bit because she seriously is incompetent, which is why after I was kicked out i was genuinely shocked at how she could manipulate so many people because she genuinely wasn't good at making herself look good. Though she did financially support others by buying them cigarettes and stuff. So that's likely why they went along with it. 


However, now that I'm older she does do the whole talking highly of me and my accomplishments BS, but she actually doesn't care and it really is for her own ego, it gets her attention and people will think highly of her."
raisedbynarcissists,fjbd0ea,t1_fjb9kgx,1583190678.0,"Wow, that's super intriguing that you were able to look back at things she wrote in your baby book. 

I think for me being the ""strong"" one would probably be the only thing that makes sense. 

But it's still a bit baffling. For the most part I was kinda just existing. I spent most of my time lost in my own little world in my head and well kept to myself for the most part as my mother never interacted with me except to yell/degrade me. 

The empathy thing gets me because my whole life I've always found it extremely difficult to connect with emotional beings, so this includes animals.
I never felt any sort of emotions for my family. I'm not saying I'm incapable all together but it is extremely difficult. Usually I can really empathize with someone when it's something I myself have experienced. 
That being said I was highly sensitive. Not like everything offends me type of sensitive but like I was very aware of my environment and feelings type sensitive. 
But also on the contrary I was a very oblivious kid. As I said I was always lost in my own world. When I'd get yelled at or screamed at I always had the deer in the headlights look. I was just so confused. This lead to people around me saying ""I didn't listen"" they use that excuse now when I bring up my past. It's not that I didn't listen I was extremely confused and just didn't understand why I was always seemingly the one who was always yelled at. However, I believe my mother manipulated people that I was such a bad kid. Honestly, I barely had any personality,a bump on a log. 

After writing this and thinking about it, it still doesn't really make sense to me. I mean even my siblings and my mother's friends had so much hatred and animosity towards me. So maybe something did happen when I was an infant that I just don't know about."

It seems that some think things are exclusively Toronto issues when really, every metropolitan has similar downfalls. Don't get me wrong the affordability sucks but I still love the city."
PCOS,f8dfxxs,t1_f8dfnxu,1574489168.0,Metformin never did anything for me. O also was tested a couple years back and was told I wasn't IR.so that's good I guess but I definitely feel like something is off.
PCOS,f8dfbqx,t1_f8dejze,1574488455.0,I know I'm ovulating by my discharge and other symptoms that I've been tracking when I'm ovulating. I just want them to analyze my hormones to see if I have any abnormal levels and I'm not sure what to really ask them. They might ask me for something more specific. I know the BCP stops ovulation but someone due to abnormal levels of certain hormones you can still ovulate on the pill. I don't quite remember what they said exactly.

Edit: not sure if this would really help with chapped ears but noes keep my lobes warm."

Stretched,f6a9524,t3_dqgqfs,1572753616.0,"It may be a sebaceous cyst. I had one and it did hurt. I originally thought it was a pimple and it never went away. Does it feel like there's any sort of fluid inside?

If it is one I would highly recommend going to your doctor rather than a piercer.

Edit: I think if you already cook and clean now you should retain those skills without vision because it's a routine task and it would be like second nature. Of course some things won't be as easy as others."

TooAfraidToAsk,f0lz5bf,t3_d5bcqm,1568733022.0,"I relate to this so hard. Growing up my mother would say ""I brought you into this world and I can take you out"" her and her friends would sit around and laugh about it. It always weirded me out. She also use to do the whole ""you have a roof over your head, food in your belly and clothes on your back"" um okay, well that's the job you signed up for when you had children so don't act like your providing me some great service. And really, I barley had any of that, we didn't have much food, it was always terrible food like a butter sandwich, or cold hot dogs, i would even just eat slices of processed cheese. The kicker is though any thing that I (did) have provided was provided by the government. Yet she still pats herself on the back."
