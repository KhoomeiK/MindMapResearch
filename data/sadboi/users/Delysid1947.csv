Perception and behavioral changes happen to me very frequently , it seems like theres very very many different persons in me.

Shamanism,fklvbp3,t1_fklkoxy,1584315395.0,"I've felt the same. I think that even if the people see or notice, most of them will instantly forget it. Maybe when this happens and you would speak out loud they would have a funny reaction. 

I feel like everyone is communicating already all the time, but on many layers, and the layers are not necessarily aware of each other. 

And about things happening around you, that relate directly to things happening inside of you. At first i thought I was doing it to the world(or the people), then,  I thought the world or the people were directly forming my mind , but finally, I would feel like it was me being dissolved in such a way that internal and external world just felt very synchronized."
Shamanism,fklubmk,t1_fkkanyz,1584314765.0,"might these be very intense and constant synchronicities? If I understand you correctly I've had something similar, quite a few times in life, where just everything that's happening in me is exposed directly in the world around me. At first this was quite overwhelming, but then I realized I might just be very dissolved and connected to the world around me, so ""my"" mind would be very synchronized with external reality. And I figured out that (most) other people do not even notice it, even when it looks like they do. I called it, being inside-out. For me it was just about learning to handle it without getting afraid, worry or overwhelmed. All this intense stuff is happening and you just act like it's normal. Then you can actually maneuver quite well in this state of experience. For me the periods didn't take that long. and now only once in a while I do experience this, but not on a constant anymore."
Dissociation,fklsnzg,t3_fj58bz,1584313719.0,"Im very often awake at night, and a bit less often awake during day. Because I sleep when I feel like sleeping. i can never really predict when i will sleep. for me it's only partially influenced by the day and night cycle, I get mainly tired in the day and awake at night. This would be impossible if you have a regular job. 

I feel very little connection with the clock-time, I'm very dissolved in what i'm experiencing, and every moment is different.

It was very difficult in school. Things i did to cope were, taking rest whenever I felt like and was able to. Just be awake at night if i couldn't sleep. At first I had to learn to not worry about it, spending time worrying about not sleeping is more draining than being awake without worrying. A night(or day) in meditative mode, or doing something quiet is also very recharging. 

but since i'm out of school i've built my life in a way that it's not a problem. and reconnect with reality? I am connected with reality, haha."
anhedonia,fkll9dd,t3_ff4iov,1584308997.0,"I enjoy staring at the wall (or other places in the universe) sometimes, it can produce colours and patterns. 

Sometimes I do feel kinda statisfied by just giving in and lay down, it can relief stress and anxiety because you realize you do NOT HAVE to do anything, you'll somehow be fine any way. 

This one sometimes pops up, going to the mirror forcing myself to laugh. Because I realize that it doesn't matter what the situation is, I could be really happy, really sad, feel nothing, feel anything. Doing this usually causes some reaction.

Producing music can be hypnotic, but i very rarely do it, although I see it as one of my main skills.

Tweaking with electronics. example: picking apart an old bluetooth speaker using the motherboard to either create a new, better, speaker or make a bluetooth input for any stereo.

Sometimes I go fishing for thoughts, writing anything down that comes to mind (even though my mind is mainly visual i always fish something out) 

Most of the time in my life I feel like I could not experience most emotions, like: happy, angry, sad. But pretty often I feel like it's possible to open up, or develop, more into subtle feelings or sensations like: euphoria, being content, some form of love, melancholy, empathy or understanding, connection ... so sometimes I like to try to open myself up to those feelings, figuring out triggers or blockages."
