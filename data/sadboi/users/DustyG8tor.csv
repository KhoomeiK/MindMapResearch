cursedcomments,fl7rx80,t1_fl7rhjx,1584908082.0,Hygiene has zero impact has the viruses ability to mutate and then infect humans. It has more to do with human proximity to live animals that carry zoonotic flu viruses. Swine flu for example could just as easily mutate and infect farmer that works with them in the US  and then spread from that farmer to others rather quickly and set off a pandemic.
cursedcomments,fl7r664,t1_fl7pwka,1584907627.0,Hygiene has nothing to do with how a virus mutates in order to set off a pandemic. Typically zoonotic infections stay in their preferred hosts. The flu virus family mutates rapidly  compared to other viruses. Sometimes a zoonotic flu virus like the avian flu will mutate in such a way that it is able to infect human beings. This is dangerous because humans have likely not developed any sort of resistance to that particular zoonotic flu virus infection since it traditionally doesn't infect humans. So when it does mutate to where it can infect humans there is a higher potential of it causing a pandemic. This is what makes flu viruses so dangerous. Due to its ability to mutate so quickly that at some point it's likely to mutate and infect humans. Humans being close to animals definitely increases the risk of a avian flu spreading into humans. That by far has more do to with population density than hygiene.

The principle being that YouTube is closing conservative accounts and therefor they are taking away a very large platform for the conservative message which decreases free speech. In a way though this is a flawed principle. 


Is it a restriction of free speech, for example, for let's say the Catholic Church to prohibit people from outside from speaking there? I would say no. While the Catholic Church is a massive platform they have every right to deny alternative messages from being stated within their walls. YouTube, which I understand now could change legally, is still considered a private platform. No matter how large the platform it is still private. I do see how YouTube denying the conservative message would be frustrating. The internet has several alternatives for video hosting but YouTube just happens to be the largest one. Conservative internet media may have to move to a different platform. I understand how that sucks for many but a lot of things in life are perfectly legal but suck."

I know many democrats, including myself, who believe Clinton certainly was in the wrong for what he did. But are you seriously going to sit here and pretend that being a child predator is an equivalent crime? If so then there is no point to arguing with you. You are incapable of rational thought. 

Trump has said things on multiple occasions that implicate him as a sexual predator whether it be a child or not. How can anyone just sit there and ignore those statements"
