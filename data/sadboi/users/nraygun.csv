Now, I hold it together OK until about week 8. That's when it's time for a booster treatment. I'm hoping the boosters get further and further apart. The treatments are expensive and are not covered by my insurance.

Of course, YMMV, but it's worth looking into. The other options are Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and ECT(my therapist said to steer clear of this option if possible).

unRAID,evvynji,t1_evvtj3j,1564850732.0,"Here's my backup script that is scheduled with User Scripts that has had names removed to protect the innocent. ;-)

The last line is a little trick I developed. I setup a dummy FreeDOS VM called ""scripts"", then the script starts the VM upon start, then shuts down the VM upon completion. That way I have a status on my dashboard if the backup script is running(scipts will say ""started"" if the backup is running). A little hacky but works.

I put a file in the root of the drives called backup1 or backup2 as appropriate so the script backs up to the current drive that's installed. That way I don't have to adjust the script when I swap drives with my offsite drive.

Adjust the directories to backup and the log location (which I will turn off when I get more time with this running without issue).

The comments also have the command to mount the backup as a file system depending on which drive is installed in the server. There's also a comment on how to create the initial backup.

Hope it helps!

For example, use lsscsi to find the drive:

Which will give you a list - look for your DVD, for example:

Then add this to the XML noting the values above:

`<controller type='scsi' index='0' model='virtio-scsi'/>`

`<hostdev mode='subsystem' type='scsi'>`

`<adapter name='scsi_host2'/>`
