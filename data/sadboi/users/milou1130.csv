jeffreestarcosmetics,fg6naad,t1_fg6l07y,1580572368.0,from his insta stories he teased a gloss and a liquid lip in new shades that are exclusive to the valentines box. i guess it could be possible that they could be in the same box since there are multiple exclusives in each.
jeffreestarcosmetics,fg5759b,t1_fg53j1w,1580519951.0,yay happy first jeffree star item!! shipping with the last 2 launches have been a shit show so who know what this will be like but he did say the hired an additional shipping team so hopefully it‚Äôs quick but yeah it‚Äôs the usual ground shipping. i feel like the boxes for the supreme seem long enough to have one in there. definitely larger than their other smallest mystery box.
jeffreestarcosmetics,fg4mi3x,t3_ewvadu,1580506378.0,hoping the premium box comes with the liquid lipstick and not the gloss he teased. ü§ûüèΩü§ûüèΩü§ûüèΩ

jeffreestarcosmetics,f9z3uk2,t1_f9xaqdv,1575737736.0,"i don‚Äôt know if what she said deserved the level of threats she was getting though. i don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs some you get what you get type of stuff from expressing disappoint. again her language wasn‚Äôt great but damn she is getting hate on an unreal level for some poorly choiced words. and he had to have known that was gonna happen when he came for her cause it‚Äôs not the first time. i love him and his makeup for sure, don‚Äôt get me wrong. but he singled her out! and that‚Äôs just next level imho."
jeffreestarcosmetics,f9z34xy,t1_f9wg26x,1575737454.0,coming after someone with the amount of followers you have and knowing your fans will come after them too is just mean????? like it‚Äôs not the first time.

jeffreestarcosmetics,f9w7o6h,t3_e75f8h,1575688356.0,"while this is awesome. i think a lot of this blew up after that one young fan spoke out about it. did she use the most respectable wording, def not. but his response to her has led her to get a significant amount of hate. she had maybe like only friends following her to then being berated by jeffree and his stans. like we‚Äôve all gotten mad at something and gone online to be like oh fuck this but don‚Äôt ever think that the person with a million something followers would see it. he needs to apologize to her for his reaction and tell people to stop attacking her when clearly others had the same opinions. she posted how she‚Äôs been supporting him for so long. like i would be so weirded out using his makeup after all this."
BPD,f3wtncb,t1_f3rdvib,1571220625.0,thanks for this advice. i told him and he was very understanding. but i‚Äôm still scared that when he sees when i depersonalize and get suicidal he will see what i actually mean and be like oh this is too much.
BPD,ew410ee,t1_ew3tvva,1565100249.0,"i only do it when i see friends i know will take pictures. i don‚Äôt know why i can‚Äôt find motivation on a daily basis to do it. that and showering, after i do it i feel better but also feel like i deserve some medal. i just wish i had the motivation to care about myself in that way."
BPD,ew3fjqu,t1_ew3anze,1565076373.0,thanks for the support! i super appreciate it. i got diagnosed after the break up so it‚Äôs been a game of what if i knew this during the relationship in my head...
BPD,ew3fia4,t1_ew3f5ul,1565076317.0,thank you. i was really upset at first but now i feel kind of like okay something finally makes sense because i felt super lost for so long that now i feel like there is a chance. thanks so much! i need all the support i can get.
BPD,ew3dfnp,t1_ew3bera,1565073538.0,"somehow we will get through this! i spent a lot of time not doing things in order to spend time with him so i‚Äôve been going back to doing those things. maybe that might help you? 

did you guys live together? we did and i‚Äôve been figuring out how to even motivate myself to pack my stuff at our place together. i‚Äôve been staying with a friend. 

also i just got my diagnosis and it leaves me wondering if i has it while i was in the relationship if that would have changed anything at all. 

i‚Äôm super sorry you are going through this too."

BPD,ew37xm7,t3_cmm3uo,1565067225.0,"hi i don‚Äôt know you but i really don‚Äôt want you to go to jail or kill yourself. i have no enlightening words to say but that just from posting that i know you are feeling lost and are seeking support. your life has value that shouldn‚Äôt be spent in a cell. you matter and i know it‚Äôs hard to see cause you might be split. give it some time before doing drastic. also if you‚Äôre in jail you can‚Äôt eat your favorite foods. that‚Äôs always been my biggest take away. 

you matter."
