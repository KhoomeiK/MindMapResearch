destiny2,fae3m03,t3_e6e2iu,1575992973.0,"Destiny New Light released on the day I had my college internal. I clearly remember my roommate crying as I played Destiny, cause he was relying on me for the assignment. I had a holiday the day after. I binged the game, understanding the mechanics. Fell in love with this, made so many new friends, but I just regret not buying the Deluxe Edition :("
