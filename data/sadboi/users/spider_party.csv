Obviously not every single woman in the world is running around getting injections and surgeries and dropping thousands on skin cream and eye shadow, but beauty culture is so pervasive in our society that it's impossible to escape it. How many women do you know that don't wear at least a little makeup? How many women do you know who don't remove any of their body hair? How many *men* do you know who do those things?

I only became aware of my attraction to women fairly recently so I have never been with one. Since discovering my sexuality I have never felt the slightest urge to cheat on my husband, and I'm certainly not going to run off and hook up with a girl just to find out what it's like, or because I think I need to ""prove"" I'm bi. I'm blissfully, perfectly happy with my husband and my bisexuality ultimately means very little to me since I have never, and probably will never act on it. It's just one small part of my life and it doesn't affect me any more than I allow it to. Being attracted to women doesn't actually change anything. 

You need to have a serious chat with yourself and figure out what it is that you really want. It sounds like you've never had a serious relationship with a woman, is that right? Do you think you're pining for women now out of a sense of curiosity? You say you love your boyfriend, so what is it about him, or about your relationship, that you find lacking and that you think a woman will give you? What is it specifically about women that you feel you're missing? These are questions only you can answer. You also need to talk to your boyfriend. Explain to him that you're struggling with these feelings and while you'd never want to hurt him, you can't help the way you feel and are confused about how to move forward. 

And please do not waste one minute worrying about what people will think of you. Unfortunately bi people have the stereotype of being slutty or unfaithful, but those are labels other people put on us, and they can only hurt you if you let them."

>The option is don’t play. That’s what I’m saying. I just want y’all to stop pretending like this leaves trans women opportunity for sport.

If trans males have removed themselves from opportunities to play competitive sports, that's their choice. Natal men can play with other natal men, or they can stay home. All you've done in this entire thread is bitch that trans males don't get to play with women and how it isn't safe for men to play with other men because some of those men wear lipstick now. And you act like this is some horrible thing society has done to you, rather than a choice you made for yourself. You absolutely do have the opportunity to play with other men, if you choose not to take that opportunity that's your choice, but for the many trans males who have made no attempt to physically transition it remains a viable option."

That's only as important as you decide it is, but personally I think names are more or less important depending on the context they're being used in. The barista at Starbucks mispronouncing your name is not a hill I'd choose to die on, but your racist teacher refusing to pronounce your traditional African name correctly is certainly a battle you should fight.

In the 31 years of my life no one has ever once pronounced my surname correctly on the first try. It's not even a really difficult name, it's only 4 letters, but the correct pronunciation is just something that nobody would ever expect. I've spent my entire life correcting teachers, classmates, co-workers, employers, doctors, etc. But I don't bother correcting the pizza delivery guy, or the lady at the DMV, or the telemarketer on the phone, because it doesn't matter. None of these people will ever see or speak to me again. It isn't important that they know my name, and it isn't worth the time or energy it takes to explain my name to every single person I meet. Sometimes I introduce myself to people with the most common incorrect pronunciation just to save time. 

All that said, I am a white woman and the mispronunciation of my name does not come from a place of racism the way it does when a black girl can't get someone to say her given name correctly. The ""woke"" media you've seen discussing this issue is on the money in that regard. It is racist when someone refuses to try to pronounce an ethnic name correctly or makes fun of PoC for having ""weird"" names. Outside of cases of obvious bigotry, I think your name is only as important as you feel it is. Correct someone every time, or let it slide when it doesn't matter. It's up to you, and I don't think it's an issue you need to make a huge political deal out of."

I've been called a ""pick me"" and a ""cool girl"" for not wanting to have kids, because of course all women *must* want to take their rightful places as beautiful goddess of motherhood. Any woman who says she doesn't want kids just has internalized misogyny and is just desperate to get a man.

I've been called a monster for saying I'd have an abortion. I've seen so called radfems arguing that women shouldn't have abortions ""just because"" their babies would be born with severe physical or mental impairments. These are the women screaming for abortion rights, but when a woman wants an abortion for a reason they dislike then suddenly abortion is eugenics and murder.

I've seen so called radfems being absolutely vile toward women who shave or wear makeup or wear anything other than potato sacks, because doing any tiny little thing about your appearance is being a slutty libfem and trying to impress men.

But because of the gendered socialization that every human person receives, we can recognize behavior trends across the two sexes. We can point out that a man is displaying male socialization when he insists that his panty fetish and sexual submissiveness make him a woman. We can point out that a woman is displaying female socialization when she is intimidated by him and goes along with what he's saying to avoid conflict. **Acknowledging gendered socialization is important to any truly feminist discussion.** If gender roles didn't exist there would be no need for feminism at all, because men wouldn't be taught from birth that they are superior to women, and women would be taught that we are inferior. Gendered socialization exists because of sex, so although the two are not intrinsically linked (because gender doesn't exist and gender roles are made up), the two are *socially* linked and cannot be divided. How do we discuss male supremacy without discussing the male socialization that *causes* that supremacy?"

Yes, exactly. What's your question? Female people receive female socialization. Whatever that female socialization looks like for their culture or generation, all female people receive it to some degree. But that in no way means that all female people actually accept that socialization, or that they become perfectly gender conforming robots.

Those women would have received the socialization of women in their culture. This isn't complicated. Why do you think female socialization stops at the US border? The fact that gender roles vary across cultures and generations proves that gender isn't innate. If it was all human beings would have the same innate gender feelings in their brains from the moment they're born. But what is considered masculine or feminine varies according to the social norms of every culture in the world.

>In fact, in some ways it is an anti-feminist argument, because it trivializes being a woman to stereotypes of being a woman.

I never thought about being attracted to girls until the last year or so, when I started reading a lot of feminist theory and seriously thinking about men and women and sexuality. I don't remember a specific moment, but it gradually dawned on me that I was attracted to women. It was very much a non-issue, since I am happily married to a man and have no desire to cheat on my husband or experiment with women just to explore or \~validate\~ my newly discovered sexuality.
