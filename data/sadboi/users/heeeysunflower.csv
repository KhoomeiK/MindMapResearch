I'm not sure if pwede i-take yung medtech in less than 4 yrs, pero if you want to shorten the amount of time na ii-spend mo during your premed, there are universities that offer acceleration programs for med that shortens the whole medical education by 1-2yrs, such as UST's LEAPMed program, UP's INTARMED program and DLSU's BS Human Biology (which your third year in premed becomes your first year in med). Although super competitive makapasok sa mga programs na 'to. Best of luck!"

Philippines,fmyf3od,t3_fwm2vm,1586484675.0,"Hi. Just wanna say that if youre aiming UP Manila, take note that the ""white"" colleges are RSA-bound. Which means, you have to render service for a number of years depending on your course. Hence, if youre planning to take up med (not in UPCM) immediately after graduating, RSA (Return Service Agreement) might get into your way. As for Bio, some say that UPM's Bio program is more inclined to med unlike those in other UP campuses that are more geared towards research, but I'm not so sure about this."

Tho I can say our government has been taking necessary actions in addressing the growing rate of mental health issues in our country such as providing free consultations and medications,but their programs are kind of accessible only in the metropolis. So, if we, from the provinces, are seeking psychological help, we would really be getting a lot of money out of our pockets. And to add, a lot of people from our country still got that strong social stigma against mental health illnesses, and would just shrug off the idea that there are really people who are suffering from these and are in pain. And yeah, I am raising my hand high because you've just really described my current situation.

It's too late when I found out how toxic the campus was for me, so I decided to drop out because my mental health was already going downhill. 

I think you should go where your heart lies, and most importantly choose the school where you'll be mentally sound. There's nothing wrong with transferring this early, at least you're already aware of what interests you and what doesnt."

I might be in the same situation because I'm planning to transfer back to my first uni after a year at the uni near home, and I'm, as well, worried about transferring again and again. But imo, I think there's nothing wrong with that, for as long as you know where your heart lies, where you think you'll be more at peace and would grow as a person. I also suggest you try talking with your guidance counselor and your parents to help you with your mental health issues and could advise you with the best course of action."

A lot of people are lost in life right now. But while you're just starting college, I think it's nice if you assess yourself now: where do you see yourself 10 yrs from now, what are your interests, what are your long-term goals, etc. If you're having doubts with your current major, I suggest you shift out to a course you will no longer have doubts with. With you being lazy, perhaps that's because of the overwhelming fear with your major and about what lies in the future, maybe try to talk to your school counselor so they can help you out with that. Wishing you luck!"
