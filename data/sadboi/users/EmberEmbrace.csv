mentalhealth,fjn10nq,t3_febzng,1583493763.0,"Have you ever spoken with a doctor about these feelings? Therapy (and possibly medication) might help lessen this self-hatred. If you can identify why exactly you feel so negative about yourself then you could try making steps toward 'adjusting' yourself to a level you're comfortable with. Perhaps diet & exercise or a new wardrobe might help. Or take up a hobby or job that makes you feel a little more unique or 'worthy'.

All of this is really simplified so I apologise if this only makes you think 'easier said than done'. Honestly I think of my self-hatred like the Incredible Hulk's 'I'm always angry' secret; I've gotten better at burying my hatred but it's always there. Lately my chemicals have changed again and it's started to rear it's head again. Try reminding yourself of why you're worthy of love and distract yourself from those negative thoughts."

AskReddit,fi9w0kd,t3_f79itq,1582284837.0,"I knew someone who suddenly started claiming they had BPD when they had no prior signs of it - from the pov of both myself and their partner.

And that one too!' yet when I mentioned BPDers are usually on the Autistic spectrum their response was 'what the hell, I'm not a retard!' I instantly hated that person. And yet they were able to get diagnosis and a nurse quicker than I have ever been able to.

There are fakers and manipulators out there yes but in my experience those people do have mental illness just of a different sort. Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Hypochondria were also suggested for them which I think suit better. Who am I to judge though?

If someone is 'faking' it they will trip themselves up eventually, especially with mental health that requires them to take meds and go to therapy. It may be frustrating but do not impose your outside beliefs on others because that attitude then stops the others who don't speak up because 'noone will believe me'.

BPD,fi8sbku,t3_f7346z,1582247200.0,It's a common thing overall with BPD I think. We experience emotions SO strongly that it's difficult to properly convey our perspective and those without it probably won't be able to properly imagine it. A film with a 'sad part' and 'touching moment' for them may be 'heartbreaking' and 'life changing' for us because we relate to it in unique & deeply personal ways. 'Abandonment' to others may be due to a partner leaving and may cause loneliness. To us that may simply be because a person didn't say hi that morning leading to catastrophic thinking and us believing we're not worthy of love. BPD is very complex and getting others to understanding is difficult. In the end I do hope you find some that understand and support you in the right way.

mentalhealth,fi6ofkn,t3_f6s7rf,1582202926.0,"Hallucinations (sights & sounds & etc that aren't there) and delusions (irrational beliefs & paranoia) are commonly associated with Schizophrenia. Being aware they're occurring is a good sign. Medication could be causing/increasing them or it could've happened regardless.

I have BPD that shares Schizophrenic traits. Within the past year my hallucinations have peaked and dipped several times. At their worst I hear various sounds like monkeys and construction work, believe my partner was talking to me when she wasn't, see eyes and mouths form on my partner's arm, and see various insects. This was usually most vivid as I was waking up or dozing. I once started panicking cause I saw an earwig go in my partner's ear. It's scary stuff. Recently I'm not so bad but do see the occasional blur in the corner of my eye.

If it isn't that frequent I wouldn't worry too much as I think most people can have one-off mild hallucinations. It is simply the imaginative mind's eye overriding the literal eye, so to speak. Still, if it's causing stress I'd reccomend seeing a doctor."

Psychotherapy can't admit again until a certain time has passed. It's frustrating.

That said, a doctor did say he would refer me for a CPN again. I've had one in the past and feel that could really help. I need to see the doctor again though he wants my partner to join me next time so it's just finding time when we're both free.

If it's causing that much stress and your brain keeps getting caught in loops then I urge you to go to a doctor. They may suggest medication and/or therapy but ultimately they will listen and try to help. Major diagnoses may take time but you may find it reassuring to be patient and address the situation than let it lie without explanation of what's going on.

I still get intrusive thoughts and take meds to keep the worst of it at bay. You may be different. It is a very scary experience when you can't control your thoughts. Just know you're not alone, it's just a minor 'glitch', and it can be patched. All the best."
