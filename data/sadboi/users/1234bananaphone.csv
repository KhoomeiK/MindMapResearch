BipolarReddit,flaloc8,t1_fl9fc8i,1584986329.0,"it wasnt drug induced. i smoked weed but i stopped smoking when it was ramping up, i was on wellbutrin at the time but i was on that for 2 years. i wonder if that contributed but i dont think it did in a way that makes bipolar invalid. idk i just think it might‚Äôve been something else? because my ‚Äòmania‚Äô wasn‚Äôt good the more severe it got i was terrified and felt out of control and was desperately trying to hold everything down in my job. isnt part of mania losing insight as well? my therapist saying shes never seen me manic gets to me as well. thank you for taking the time to respond"
BipolarReddit,fj7fmx2,t3_f8y736,1583090968.0,"what your parents are doing is medical neglect which is considered child abuse. i dont know where you are but some governments can intervene on stuff like this. i l went through similar when I was 15 when my mom decided she knew better than a psychiatrist and left me untreated missing school because i was so sick. I don‚Äôt recommend it. if you cant get through to another adult in your life tell your psychiatrist what‚Äôs happening and what your parents said, depending on where you are you‚Äôre protected by law that your psychiatrist wont tell your parents they know"
BipolarReddit,fj476ki,t3_fays1m,1583001841.0,"the first time i was being considered for a bipolar 2 diagnosis i didnt get one for similar reasons to yours. a few years later I had a manic episode and psychotic features and diagnosed bipolar 1. in my case i was 20 at that time and likely didn‚Äôt recognize much of mania, came in depressed, and my psychiatrist told me to watch for it since it can still develop"
Psychosis,fi558x6,t3_f6f0ey,1582155216.0,"it sounds like she‚Äôs assessing for how critical it is, if the hallucinations aren‚Äôt telling you to do anything that may harm you/others then it‚Äôs not urgent to put you in a ward and stabilize that asap after that meeting so shes moving on to the next thing to assess. when I was assessed for the psych ward i got into they also brushed over the hallucinations questions cause everything I had in that realm was harmless (hearing inaudible voices, random people just talking, brief visual things). it really felt like they were ignoring and downplaying my concerns about hallucinations though especially given how terrified i was of it happening. I think you should follow up on that with her, she should really be cueing you in on this though. and if you feel like you are in danger to yourself or others even though the voices aren‚Äôt telling you to do anything you need to emphasize this

edit:
also keep in mind that psychs jobs aren‚Äôt to listen to everything you say in the same way a therapist does, but to treat you with meds. so lots of the time they think they know what can help those symptoms so that‚Äôll be the end of that conversation"
BipolarReddit,fhmk1v7,t3_f3tfii,1581713944.0,"definitely relate. vyvanse & adderall saved my life during my last major depressive episode where i almost lost my job because of the depression (mainly time and attendance issues), let alone near failed that semester. I‚Äôm unfortunately cut off from taking any stimulants now because of my mania and psychosis, and i dont think i need it to that extent these days anyways because im not depressed, but ill never forget how that stuff physically pulled me out of that depression and allowed me to live during that time. im soooo thankful"

BipolarReddit,eyg6dqc,t3_cwt9iy,1567062458.0,"currently I take Seroquel XR & IR, the IR at bedtime to help me sleep & pretty much I determine how much to take everynight (with a prescribed range from the pdoc), more for the more manic I happen to be & need to knock out"
BipolarReddit,eyg1lks,t1_ey8n2k1,1567059465.0,"idk what i wanted tbh, at that time I just wanted answers. I didnt know what was happening to me esp why work was so hard at that time. When the psych brought up psychosis I rolled with it & recalled more things that aligned with that and i guess at that point i wanted a bp1 dx. 

My therapist was aware of the episode and helped me cope with it with CBT (which, the best I got was knowing the unlikelyness of a thought I had but unable to detach from it) yet hasnt mentioned any name for it.  i think she generally avoids labels. once when i briefly mentioned a behaviour with my swings (much before my hospitalization, & talking about the past) she brought up that the behaviour sounded like cyclothymia or bipolar 2. Shes also pretty recent and i started seeing her while manic which may explain why she even brought up cyclothymia, she hasnt seen me depressed & she hasnt seen any other descriptions of my reality than what I told her while ‚Äúup‚Äù, & I‚Äôve been diagnosed in a moderate-severe depressive episode some years ago from another psychiatrist so ik that its there. My therapist also tied my delusions to past trauma/a thought pattern i was conditioned to (i think shes diagnosed me with cptsd) and i felt invalidated by hearing that but when i told a nurse at the hospital she pretty much said those things are valid in delusions. Then when I told my psych later she boiled it down to ‚Äúdo you always feel a strong distrust of people?‚Äù which I answered no (and she said that validates it being a psychotic feature in a mood ep rather than personality) but I honestly couldn‚Äôt clearly recall how I was before that episode 

Also your quitting scenario sounds like a crash to me, ironically when that happens to me i wonder the same stuff & deny im depressed lol"
BipolarReddit,ey4ssmk,t3_cvkfvp,1566806148.0,"yep üôÉ. lots of times i think that i made some shit up to fit the diagnosis (because i know what bipolar was) or that i manipulated the drs who diagnosed me for that exact diagnosis, i doubt my psychotic features were actually psychotic in the sense that every non-bizarre delusion was actually happening or ‚Äújust anxiety‚Äù & the bizarre delusions and hallucinations were me just being ‚Äúcreative‚Äù with shit instead of actually experiencing them. also my hallucinations were so little & random, auditory ones restrained to me mishearing things/hearing something out of white noise & the first psych that evaluated me at the hospital said i moreso was going through hyper-vigilance than full blown psychosis hallucinations. i overheard the inpatient intake psych i saw the next morning tell the psych ward over the phone that i presented as hypomanic (as in, not bp1 manic as i was later diagnosed) & my hospitalization was voluntarily. I took disability for work and one huge fear is that what made me increasingly incapable of working wasn‚Äôt a manic turned mixed episode but my own incapability for the job, which i was at for the last two years just fine"
BipolarReddit,evx4yag,t3_clexwz,1564882015.0,"
prescribed Zoloft when I was 15 for anxiety, triggered mania immediately & was off it by day 4 as I stopped sleeping completely. Cipralex when i was 20-21 for depression which helped me get out of that ep but I would notice that id cycle between 1-3day hypomania & depression where I would just struggle to stay awake at my internship desk job or be so restless & irritable id be on my phone all day at my
desk online shopping & talking/swiping on tinder/bumble and on tons of online forums to stay ‚Äúsane‚Äù sitting all day at my desk job. psych added abilify to help with the cycling which levelled that out a bit but it was still not ideal. 21-23 I was on wellbutrin which reallllyy did help with my functioning during depressive eps & any brain fog i had before that made school harder on old meds. At one point though i did have an ep where i was hypersomnic & sleeping in for work a lot so got stimulants on top of that, which were hellish in themselves since they fucked with my moods and didnt help with studying but at least i still had a job? lol. Then in the last bit of being on wellbutrin my manic eps got more clear (but i was also journaling a lot during that time) and depression too even though i was still functional. Then I had months long manic ep I was trying to ease out of but in the last week-or-twoish when i would swing down (ie, w energy levels/sleep) it would oddly swing back up & i became v suicidal and increasingly paranoid & delusional of everyone and realized i was hallucinating and uh I was hospitalized diagnosed bipolar 1 w a mixed psychotic ep and the psych told me to never go on antidepressants ever again"
