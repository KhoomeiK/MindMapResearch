PetAdvice,fqzp4j6,t1_fqwwegd,1589772178.0,"From my experience, you have to do the best you can to ignore it. If you give into to the whining then the dog will think that he can whine to get whatever he wants. I went through this with my first dog, he cried and cried about being stuck in the cage, had the worst nights sleep, but honestly he was the sweetest dog once he grew out of it.

TLDR: Don‚Äôt appease the dog by giving it attention when it whines, try to ignore it he will stop

Just curious tho what kind of dog is it?"
