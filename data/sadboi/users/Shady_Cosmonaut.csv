AntifascistsofReddit,fdnzzzg,t1_fdnynae,1578596299.0,What distinguishes a fascist from those of antifa is that a fascist is the oppressor agitating the oppressed and antifa is a direct result of the oppressed taking action against the oppressor violence does not mean fascism. Sitting around and being a pacifist will not solve the contradiction. Historically violence does lead to change and with every action comes reaction. Antifa is an umbrella leftist group which has internal disagreements on the ways revolution should be carried out yet they dont go out of their way to attack each other when a united front against is fascism is more beneficial. Also antifia also existed in nazi germany and they labeled them just as much a threat. Maybe just maybe they are labeled as a terrorist group due to their stand against an system of oppression.

vegan,f6up6b3,t1_f6unc0c,1573166000.0,This isnt exactly an ideal situtation where we can just wait on people to accept  veganism and see it like we do. It takes so many resources to produce meat that it is entirely inefficient. Also take into account resources are only going to become more scarce. Action needs to be taken and non-violent protests and getting together to sgoe off our picket signs is just going to fail. Im not trying to say attack meat eaters either because they are just consuming whats being produced. What im getting at is more with taking down institutions such as animal farms so the choice of getting meat for sustinence is not possible.
vegan,f6twadf,t3_dsv5ia,1573154918.0,"Veganism is a step but if we are ""kind"" and accepting of the monstrous corporations that set up the animal farms, then we arent going to stop anything.
