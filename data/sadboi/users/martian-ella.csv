And am indubitably depressed too. I feel you and get what you mean... 

I’ve been to therapy thinking that I would actually get better but it got worse... I’ve been diagnosed with depression but I don’t really think so... I think I’m just empty but full of nihilistic thoughts... I guess I never really was honest.

My parents and my therapist are also the religious kinds and the sole reason as to why I’ve never really been honest at all my sessions. The worse part of this sht is that my parents correlate depressed with Satan’s influence...


I can say that my life is relatively good but I hate it... there are many reasons as to why and I wish it was possible to donate my life to someone who badly needs it...

But I’m advising you to hold on... life is sht and may be worthless but maybe something someday could make it all worth it...

And that is the reason why even though I scar myself, I carry on. I think of a future, of something I’m yearning for... and it’s to adopt a little girl someday...give her the best life she could have and the chance to be the woman that I always wanted to be...


And p.s. social media is sht thus try to refrain from it..."
depression,f9289jw,t3_e3bgve,1575017385.0,"i’m glad and really happy for you... i wanna be the same and i really really do...

but the thing is... i’ve been to therapy and had wonderful talks and after each, I get all inspired and my heart doesn’t seem to be that heavy...but it doesn’t last... a big part as to why this was because although i let out the truth in every talk i had... i never really let out EVERYTHING...


i’t wasn’t about being sad or trying to be happy... it was just because i was empty... i didn’t see the point of living and to which then countless of thoughts that range from past mistakes to thinking about if people hate me to all the things that i regret and should have done and to the imperfections of my life..."

morbidquestions,f91zknt,t3_e2z6kp,1575006618.0,"I think of doing stuff like this all the time but most of the time, it’s just stuff that I would get MYSELF killed.

It’s a weird feeling but I have this sort of impulse to do these stuff...but my body sorts of like represses it because if it doesn’t, I could really kill myself or in some cases, others around me."

depression,f7odcso,t1_f7oc0fq,1573925566.0,"Hm... I dunno... it’s just...I think of lots of things. My mind is immensely full of different thoughts. But maybe it stems mostly from my family and my shtty home. 

And amidst all these thoughts... I do have this sort of string that I hold on to. I, same as you, would like to be independent but not like completely detached  from my family. I would want to liberate myself, probably study abroad or get a condo nearby but what I really want is just to travel somewhere really far away.

I also would like to adopt a baby girl someday in the future, take her as my own. Raise her to be the woman that I always wanted to be and basically love her so that I could put my unused love that was meant for myself to good use. 🙃"
