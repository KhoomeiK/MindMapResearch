TooAfraidToAsk,fir67ft,t3_f99yvv,1582658171.0,"This is something that has come up a lot in recent years because of the decline of religion and the lack of understand of mortality along with the prevalence of a very individualistic society. Death is depicted by society as an unimaginable atrocity that is out of the ordinary and is often seen as a tragedy, which has given us the lack of coping skills and defense mechanisms to appropriately deal with it. Therefore most of us are left to repress it and remain shocked and gutted when it either starts to happen to us or happens to someone around us. It's also why we face the looming existential dread which, while incredibly common and expected, is denied by the general public and seen as an anomaly. 

So yes, most of us deal with this, with increased panic in those of us who don't have a religion to fall back on"
