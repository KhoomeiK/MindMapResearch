medizzy,fct61pw,t1_fct2cbm,1577933806.0,"Naw you‚Äôre right that there‚Äôs phalloplasty techniques using the thigh and even abdomen as donor sites. It‚Äôs not preferred as erotic sensation is generally reduced using these techniques when compared to radial forearm flap. (Iirc it‚Äôs because of things like reduced vasculature and fewer nerves to hook up) 


But my point was that all of these phalloplasty techniques are completely different from the procedure in the OP‚ÄîI would get phalloplasty in a heartbeat if it meant that they were growing functional erectile, penile tissue on arms/thighs/etc then grafting them onto the site like they did with the ear of this patient. Instead the best technique we have at the moment is taking pre existing structures from the donor site and constructing a phallus from arm tissue, thigh tissue, etc, then adding an erectile device and urethral lengthening if desired by the patient. (Which, btw, is amazing technology and results are awesome. Just not for everyone)"
