AmItheAsshole,fap229t,t3_ea5rvf,1576277936.0,"YTA- but only slightly. If she is using it as an excuse EVERY time you ask her to do something then NTA, but from your description it just seems like it’s episodic. Don’t let her off the hook for not doing something but instead give her a grace period to do it so she can do her tasks when she is less anxious. As to her not going out with you and your sister, get over it. I understand it was disappointing and an inconvenience to you, but the anxiety is super debilitating and if someone told me to suck it up because it would hurt the feelings of someone else I’d react how she did too. Your sister should have understood the impact of the situation. Your attitude towards “Sitting down numerous times to help her with her anxiety” seems inconsiderate and like you expect her anxiety to just be fixed after a certain amount of “sit downs” with her. She will most likely have anxiety the rest of her life so it’s not a short term “let’s sit down and figure this out”, it’s a long term across her lifespan “let’s sit down so we can continue practicing working through the anxiety”. It will most likely take her years to manage it, but it won’t just go away because you expect a coup of sit downs to help. I saw a comment where you seemed upset that your daughter won’t share what she says in therapy, and you need to respect that you can’t fix her because there is nothing to fix. Keep practicing your understanding of her condition."

It’s your right to do whatever you please because it’s your house and I would probably do the same tbh. But I will say the family did make the house theirs with their upgrades because they had intention to buy it HOWEVER if your grandpa intended to let them buy it he should have maybe left the house to them or left you a note.

I went to a predominantly white (and Asian) upper class but public high school. We never learned about current racism so I honestly didn’t know it was still around. Everyone in my high school was never outwardly racist and I never saw racism in the news in my town.

I don’t know how long after you walked away from your child that she intervened but she sounds stupid for thinking you were really going to leave her there especially after you made it clear you were just trying to carry out a punishment. After clarifying with her what you were actually doing she could have just stayed close by and monitored the situation just to make sure you weren’t actually going to leave your child but to keep going is just stupid. I would say if that punishment has worked in the past then it’s fine because you are just parenting, I don’t know why other people are saying you are raising your child wrong. Your child is 2 so reasoning with her might be something you try when she’s a little older I think you were fine in your parenting style."

I’m not saying you can’t cave every once in a while but if you don’t train your child now, it will only get worse and the longer you let this go on the harder it will be to correct. Also, caving on this issue will lead to a habit of caving on other things for the short term immediate reward but it will be bad in the long term.
