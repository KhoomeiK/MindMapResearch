BipolarSOs,fobiceq,t1_fnwxehr,1587660105.0,"There are studies that have been formally conducted about this, but honestly it was a very poorly constructed study with way to small a sample size and lots of confounding variables. I drank the microdosing kool-aid and it’s what made my bipolar disorder fully rear its ugly head. It has promise, and it may be prove to be effective with more studies and more research, but people with a past family or personal history of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia really should never touch hardcore psychedelics."
BipolarSOs,fobh6sf,t3_g4c3s7,1587659758.0,"I see a lot of people offering you great advice, but I just wanted to add this. The first rule of psychedelics - LSD, shrooms, ayuhescua, mescaline- is that if you have a personal or family history of bipolar or schizophrenia, you should NEVER touch psychedelics as it can trigger a psychotic episode. If that happens you and your children could even be in danger. Tripsafe.org has resources about this. Please please stay safe and if he does decide to move forward and take LSD- especially regularly- seek shelter with family or friends.
Edit: another risk factor, now that I’m considering it. There is no regulations in regards to illegal substances such as LSD. If he is not testing it, there is a risk of it being NBOMe which acts similarly to LSD but is much riskier because you can easily accidentally overdose on it. (Which you can take a lot more LSD, and while you might have a bad time you won’t overdose. The only recorded “overdose” death related to LSD was an elephant who was given 3000x the dose that it should have for its size, and evidence supports the elephant died from cardiac arrest from fear rather than the LSD. I point this out because people will think it’s safe to take a high dose of LSD, but if it’s NBOMe, it could kill them)"

For example, homes in California are built of lightweight materials such as plaster so that if in the event of a serious earthquake less heavy material could potentially fall on a person. Alternatively in places with hurricanes, there may be more concrete to protect against debris flying through the air at high speeds."

I got the initial drop in the first 6 months, and then my weight took time to settle and I’ve been maintaining for almost a year now. I want to lose a few more pounds but was feeling very discouraged and found that old picture of mine, so I’m sorry I can’t give a more specific timeline! 
Something else to take into account is that I am pretty tall- 5’10” or 178 cm, and that is a factor in calculating TDEE, and had a very active job at the time. 
Also not pictured is my mastoplexy (breast lift) and j-plasma (to help aid with loose skin) which definitely had an influence on the aesthetic impact of my results. 
Dedication and consistency is the biggest key, it helps to look at weight lost over all. It’s hard when you’re looking from pound to pound, but I know you can do this!! I hope this helps!"

fasting,fker4uq,t1_fkeosnz,1584118947.0,"I did 20:4 regularly but liked to do one 24 hour fast a week (on days with no gym!! And if I planned to drive I wouldn’t do an extended fast that day.) 
I also counted calories so my meals and snacking were pretty flexible. It was helpful to me to have a calorie goal for the week rather than the day, so I could shift around my calories to fit social demands as needed. This helped me not go “Well I ruined today, may as well go crazy” because it meant I had less to eat the next day. 
BUT- here are some of my favorite low cal foods: 
- Soup. Especially chicken tortilla and miso soup. Added bonus of being fermented, cause studies show that a healthy gut biome is linked to better weight management. 

- popsicles, for a sweet tooth (low calorie and time consuming to eat) 

-egg whites 

And a meal I would do was from scratch tofu pad Thai, but sub the noodles with shirataaki noodles! Makes yah poop, and only 150 cals a serving. I included the recipe I followed in my previous post I made about it :)

She replied no, but it was awful he handled it that way. If she had given a name, what if the family hadn’t been informed yet? What if she was wrong, and now a family has to go through the unneeded additional pain of thinking they lost a child? I was so bothered by how it was handled.
