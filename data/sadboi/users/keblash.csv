I thought It was just a slight cold but im not coughing and have no fever or a runny nose or anything else so acid seems more likely I guess. The surge feeling did start yesterday mainly after I had breakfast. I just took a tums and the burning went down a little bit. Im just so scared that its something more serious that will kill me if I try and sleep again.

If I'm sitting down it happens a little more and even more when I lay down and the most when im falling asleep. It doesn't really feel like im holding my breath because it also happens sometimes when im awake and know that I am consistently breathing. its like a pulse/spasm that makes me feel like I cant breath for a split second then I take a big breath.

I've also never really been able to find anything about what I'm feeling so hearing that I'm not alone makes me feel better.

PanicAttack,fcnpkrh,t3_ei1g3e,1577816023.0,"M 26. This exact thing happened to me 2 days ago. I was just eating some soup watching Netflix and then suddenly it felt like you described, like I was having some kind of allergic reaction and I couldn't breath at all for 2-3 seconds then it just disappeared. Ive been in panic mode about it since. It happen a few years ago too when I took a bite of a Twix bar and then again a year ago when I started chewing a piece of gum. Both of those things I've eaten so many times before with no issue at all but kinda of avoid now because of the fear. Im scared out of my mind about it right now because I have no idea what happened and Ive barely eaten anything since it happened and feel like any second its going to happen again but this time I will die from it. Even drinking water I'm just waiting to stop breathing as soon as I take a sip.

 I haven't seen a doctor about it which makes it worse and I haven't really been able to find anyone else who has had this happen to them so it makes me feel just a tiny bit better that I'm not the only one. 

In the past Ive just slowly forgotten about it over time because I had to continue eating to continue living and the not being able to breath thing happened so rarely compared to how often I had to eat. But every time its happened I've gone into panic mode for at least a week and just slowly slowly worked my way back up to eating things normally again. At the moment I'm in panic mode about it and its absolutely terrible :( I wish we knew exactly what was happening so we could a-dress it and move on."
Anxiety,fclllmo,t1_fclky3l,1577750648.0,could have been that. not sure if a panic attack caused it or I had a panic attack because of it though. Im hoping it was either just due to the spices irritating my throat somehow or a panic attack. My doctors office just closed so I'm looking for a new doctor that takes my insurance so I don't know when I'll be able to check in with a doc and I broke my phone a few days ago so I don't have a way to call anyone in an emergency for another few days when my new one comes in so its really really stressing me out.

I have nothing to do pretty much everyday while everyone else I know has a good job or a family or at least a gf/bf or is regularly seeing friends. The majority of my time is spent alone in my room staying up till 5am. This is in Stark contrast to how my life has been up until a year ago. I grew up with 7 siblings and when I moved out I moved out with a few friends and we had our friend group at my house almost every night just to hang and do fun shit for then next 3-4 years. Now they are all moved out or have a family and are busy all the time. I'm just alone and never have anyone to talk to bit don't want to burden anyone I know with my issues so I keep myself isolated even though I desperately want to be around people. Even when I do reach out my anxiety usually takes over and makes me wish I was back home alone where it's safe. Fuck me I can't stand living like this but I have no clue how to really truly change anything. I just want things to go back to how they were when me and all my friends were still in college.

On top of that they sometimes trigger the ""holy shit, it's a brain tumor/anyrism/blood clot this time I know it"". They make it almost impossible to focus on anything else let alone allow me to actually WANT to do anything. If I massage my head/neck/shoulders I can usually lessen the pain a small amount though.

Anxiety,esg6763,t1_esg5kcr,1561944215.0,Everything's ng I've read says a high fever is one of the first signs. I took mone and it was exactly 98.6. that still didn't help because them I read that not everyone has all of the symptoms. Just great. Another nugget for my anxiety to latch onto.
HealthAnxiety,esg5ky6,t3_bzooyo,1561943751.0,"This post is a bit old, but I am you. Just finished my fear of a heart failure two days ago. I felt good for about 12 hours then I remembered my neck had felt a little stiff for the last few days. Que intense fear that I have meningitis. It's been almost 2 days that I've though of nothing else. I'm hoping you're feeling better since it's been 2 weeks since your post. If not, I'm in the same boat. 

If you are feeling better about it, what helped?"
HealthAnxiety,esfi90n,t3_c7bmh8,1561926831.0,"Right now its pretty bad. I can't convince myself that my dry eyes, slight headache and slight neck stiffness is NOT meningitis and in fact from my poor posture watching/playing video games, lack of exercise, and my anxiety being really high the last week affecting my sleep. All week my neck has felt a little stiff when I turn my head but I was to busy freaking out about heart attacks to pay attention to it. The moment I feel better about my heart I remember my neck feels funny and then I spiral thinking its meningitis and since then I haven't been able to think about anything else or do anything productive. I was supposed to up my dosage of Lexapro over a month ago but I never did because I was scared I would get side effects and have more anxiety again. Ironic."
Anxiety,esd0dhe,t3_c74p01,1561843712.0,Im in that situation right now. Just decided a few hours ago I have meningitis because Ive had some slight stiffness in my neck when I turn my head for the last few days. Just finished a week long freakout about chest pains before that. Every time I come on here to post and find reassurance I ended up reading a bunch of people posts. Just knowing that Im not the only one who freaks out about this stuff help and if I read a post about something Ive rationalized is ok and not life threatening I reply and while Im replying I forget about what Im currenty worried about. It's nice.
Anxiety,escu8d2,t1_esctqkh,1561839023.0,"so, to be clear, I don't have meningitis?"
Anxiety,es7uc1y,t1_es7t9h5,1561680053.0,"Interesting, I've never heard of that one. I'll have to look into it. Actually having peace of mind would be so amazing! I've always been worried about going to the doc for peace of mind but instead finding ng out I do have something seriously wrong like I've been thinking."
Anxiety,es7t8gz,t1_es7scmn,1561679192.0,"I have read that, it just sadly didn't do much to quell my fears :( I was going to make a doc appointment today but I also have a fear of them confirming that I do have something wrong so I didn't call... When I am able to think about it rationally I know it's unlikely it's anything serious, but anxiety has gotten the better of me quite a bit the last few months. Anyway, thank you for your response, it helps."
