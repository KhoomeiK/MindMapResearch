If your socks were designed by someone to perform a specific purpose, imagine what your worth is. We are all created , be it a phenomena of the universe or by the Creator (whatever you believe) and we all have a purpose. You belong in this fabric of life and achieving our said purpose in life takes time. Itâ€™s okay to be lost rn, itâ€™s okay to not be okay. You can always reach out to someone. Take it easy and go through every day step by step."

mentalhealth,fomxsq8,t1_fomxes6,1587907080.0,Journaling has helped a lot in the past and I picked it up again recently. It helped with my anxiety attacks that would happen whenever I saw my dad. Iâ€™ve done FaceTimes and zoom calls with friends but theyâ€™re busy and Iâ€™ve been enough of a burden on them. I would imagine itâ€™s tiring for them as well to deal with my sad and chaotic family. But I will incorporating affirmations to deal with this. I appreciate your advice ðŸ’•
