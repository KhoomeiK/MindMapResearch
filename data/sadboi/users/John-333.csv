It can be in many forms. Like, for instance, you'd ride a camel by the pyramids and then find that 10-minute ride cost you $500. Or that you get a souvenir that's like $100 or more and later find out that it's actually Chinese made and you could've got it from anywhere in the world for a fraction of the price. Of course, it's not always like this, but yeah, that can happen. Maybe more often now than it used to be.


> What are the reasons for it being hell for people that live there?


Well, the reasons are too many to count or list in one comment tbh. But to answer your question, I'd sum it up in, ""Basic life conditions and services are quite scarce."" So imagine a place amid pandemic where your room would qualify as a better and safer option to recover if you catch the virus than it is in hospital, due to lack of resources and general ignorance. 


> Are you planning to stick around or move?


I wish. And I've been trying for the past 5 years or so. Last one was through the US immigration program, but the virus and Trump pretty much killed that. So, nothing seems to be working, and, frankly, I doubt it's ever gonna happen, mostly due the fact that this country resembles a big jail, and if you happen to have been born here, you only have 2 options: 1) Give up, get institutionalised and serve your time. 2) Die trying to. A thing which, of course, may or may not work."
