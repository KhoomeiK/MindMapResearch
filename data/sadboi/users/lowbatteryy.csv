depression,ffe99l7,t1_ffe8hkk,1579840219.0,I’m surprised she hasn’t offered to help you more. Maybe the two of you could come up with a plan to tell your mom?

depression,ffe3lrt,t3_et4c0p,1579835811.0,Your post does not seem like you made it up for attention. It sounds like you’re really struggling and need help. It sounds like you care for your family. Would you ever consider talking to a school counselor about your feelings and thoughts of suicide? I know it’s hard but help is better than suffering in silence. Reach out to me it you want to talk.

depression,ff58hf0,t1_ff58enb,1579583361.0,That sounds great. I hope it goes well for you and sending you good vibes to get you through it. Good luck.
depression,ff586s0,t1_ff57lxn,1579583090.0,You’re not too weak to still be hurting at all. I can tell you that your wife will not respond in anything but love and support. It really helps to have your feelings on the outside and not only on the inside. I think putting what you’ve been through here is the first step to being able to talk about it and for it to get better. Maybe you could write it out to her in an email or text? Or tell her that you’re struggling with something without telling her the details? I’m sure she will be there to support you either way.
depression,ff57jj6,t3_erpn3s,1579582518.0,You just described exactly how I feel. I can only hope it gets better with therapy and medication. I’m so worried it won’t though. I’m sorry I know this isn’t any advice or anything but I feel the same way.
depression,ff575g7,t1_ff56r3p,1579582177.0,I know how you feel. I’ve felt this way. It is completely normal. For me it really helped me to tell my friends. I still haven’t told a therapist yet but it helps telling a friends where you feel like you’re in a safe place with their friendship.
depression,ff56hry,t3_erpcxn,1579581617.0,I’m sorry this happened to you. Have you tried to work through it in therapy or talk to anyone about it?

Anxiety,ff06oww,t1_ff05xfq,1579465734.0,Good to know. Long term relief would be literally a life saver. I would be able to go back to school and live my life. I’m getting emotional knowing some people have been helped with this and there is hope for me. Thank you.

socialanxiety,fezwee2,t1_fezw0ts,1579462529.0,Me too. It makes me feel more self conscious around them and avoid them because I think they will realize that I’m actually ugly next time I see them.
socialanxiety,fezvqqr,t3_er0x76,1579462284.0,Does anyone else feel worse when someone reassures them? And uncomfortable and more ugly when someone tells them they are beautiful or compliments them?
SuicideWatch,fezt9q9,t1_fewtqjg,1579461365.0,I’m sorry to hear you’re having a relapse. Don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you need to.
Anxiety,fezsw4n,t1_fexvjn7,1579461227.0,I think I’m going to ask my doctor about kolonopen. I read it might cause suicidal thoughts. Already have a problem with that so I am very conscious of that side effect. Did you experience that?
depression,fexo1pb,t3_eqv7ox,1579433823.0,I take 30 mg of lexapro and I don’t have any negative side effects. It’s helped me some. I can’t completely say because I haven’t been doing well with taking it but when I was it helped me a lot. Some doctors did think I was suicidal as a side effect if it at first but that is to expect with anything. I say you should try it out. Hope it helps you. Good luck!
vegetarian,fexkkwu,t3_eqv2hn,1579432493.0,Congratulations on going vegetarian! One brand I would suggest is morning star they have great vegan chicken nuggets and lots more non meat meat products.
Anxiety,fexitub,t1_fexi5rs,1579431687.0,Hydroxyzine. I don’t think it is very strong. My dr prescribed it for me to sleep but because I’m not going to school at the moment I took it during the day and then I had to visit a new place and I found it helped a lot with the anxiety I would usually feel.
Anxiety,fexhmdt,t1_fexg005,1579431141.0,Oh I am surprised you take it at night. I just take it before an anxious situation or I don’t think it would be strong enough.
depression,fewxyn5,t3_eqtke2,1579421212.0,Yep. I’ve felt that way before. I’m sorry you’re struggling.
depression,fewxddn,t1_fewp5xu,1579420942.0,"Some treatments work for some people and other treatments for others some treatments that have helped people I know are ketamine, ect, iop, rtc, wilderness, medication, talk therapy, other types of therapy. Have you tried any of these treatments?"
DoesAnybodyElse,fewnzqk,t3_eqt0n7,1579416441.0,I’m so like this. I’m so embarrassed and turn the sound down on my earbuds in case anyone can hear what I’m listening too. And I’m not embarrassed about my taste in music. Haha I feel you. Good to know someone else does this too.
depression,fewnngz,t3_eqsxda,1579415961.0,I know how you feel. I just feel guilty when people tell me they love me.

DoesAnybodyElse,fewcbr5,t3_eqicxc,1579408295.0,Yeah but it’s weird to say oh yeah! I listened to that book
SuicideWatch,few7ss6,t1_few6i9t,1579406583.0,I’m glad to hear you are trying treatments. It is good to hear. You’re life is valuable and I hope things get better for you. Sending good vibes and wishes for you to feel better. Good luck.
depression,few4wbw,t1_few473q,1579405414.0,"I’m sorry to hear. Opening up is so hard. All I can say is I urge you to see a therapist, go to the hospital, attend a group therapy and get the help you need. You deserve it and owe it to yourself to take care of yourself."
depression,few441w,t1_few3jt0,1579405082.0,Treatment may be able to work wonders. It works for some people and doesn’t for others. I urge you to try to get treatment. So many people feel the same as you you’re not a failure for feeling this way.
depression,few3f63,t3_eqr3zk,1579404793.0,Hey. I’m really sorry your struggling. I understand how you are feeling and there is some people out there who may be able to help you. There’s people who know how you’re feeling and have gotten better. Things are always changing and adjusting. Have you tried treatment yet? I’m hear if you want to vent more
SuicideWatch,few26uw,t3_eqr2o9,1579404446.0,Sorry you’re struggling. It sucks. I feel similar to you and like my life just won’t get better. Have you been in treatment? I’m hear it you want to vent/ someone to relate to
depression,few1k87,t3_eqqxoo,1579404166.0,Sorry to hear you are struggling. I feel you. Once I expressed this to one of my friends from the hospital and she suggested I read this book “a monster calls”. I never read it but she said that how I was feeling reminded her if that book. I’m here if you want to talk further.
depression,few0lz4,t3_eqqx8g,1579403773.0,I’m sorry you’re struggling. I’m here if you want to vent to someone.
depression,feizkc7,t3_epen8y,1579151715.0,That sucks that the therapist did not hear you. Obviously it is not just sleep. It is your real feelings and saying that it is just because of sleep so invalidating and annoying. It sounds like your therapist is stupid and not good at their job. I’m sorry they are making you feel this way I think you should find another therapist who can help you.
depression,feis5m7,t3_epd8lc,1579145827.0,I am very sorry that you are struggling right now. It sucks. Drinking feels so good. I’m not an alcoholic but I know what you mean. I always get very sad and don’t really function after I drink. Maybe it’s coming down from a high or coming down from feeling good or something? I don’t know. Also my father is an alcoholic but I don’t have a relationship with him anymore.  I am in the same place as you with feeling like I’m ruining my life. I can’t go to school but not going makes me more suicidal and makes me not do well in general and feeds into not functioning. I’m 15 and should be a sophomore in high school. These years are so important to set up my life and I know I’m ruining it. Anyway I know it’s hard right now. I’m here for you. Maybe you should talk to a therapist about your troubles a professional may be able to guide and help you and give you an insight to how deal with this. Good luck.
Anxiety,feh9dxs,t3_ep48x8,1579111871.0,I am in the same position as you with not being able to go to school and attend classes. I am a high school student. I am really sorry to hear you are struggling with this. You are not alone.
depression,fege5u1,t3_enrs4c,1579089583.0,Yes I find I can’t describe how I am feeling as depression or anxiety because I know there are people with depression and anxiety worse than mine. I just feel like it is who I am and not a mental illness or something that can or deserves to be treated but I know it’s not nothing because I can’t go to school and don’t want to live
