Trust me, I'm dealing with unreciprocated feels for my best friend. We discussed it, it's going hard b/c of some slightly related stuff. But we're still friends, still working it out. I can't promise it will work out that well. But I can say that your current situation is untenable."

socialskills,fksk04a,t3_fkew39,1584491817.0,"The swipe mechanic is meant to be like that. Like a game meant to be addiction and occupy you.

I do however, like the sections bumble fills in. I like reading profiles. 

Overall I'd recommend not treating it seriously. People rarely reply in my experience on bumble, so there's no reason to give much of a fuck about how ""good"" the message is. I just send silly stuff like gifs or try to compliment people. It's just a lot more fun when you don't give a fuck"
