in regards to P.E: would it be possible to wear a thermal/longer layer under your gym clothes? or some make up would do the trick (if you don't have any, a friend is likely to give you some (if you want to explain why)), or if they're not too deep/fresh you could doodle on yourself in that area and it's a lot more unlikely that people will see...
