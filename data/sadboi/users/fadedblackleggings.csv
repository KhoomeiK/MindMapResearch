The only people allowed in were 2-3 relatives, and my parent's clients. 

So either business, or the very few people allowed to ever visit us. No one really was able to get too close that was an ""outsider"", no invites for lunch, dinner, or BBQs, etc. No sleepovers or surprise visits from my friends.

And we rarely went into anyone else's home either. The isolation was pretty severe."

Yes, like a group of people you are becoming friends with invite you to ""another bar"" after an event together. 

That ""next bar"" is usually an opportunity to connect with them on a more intimate social level. 

Me, I was often saying no because I was sleepy, heading home confused, and wondering why we never became better friends. Not understanding that many people read saying no to the next place, as also saying no to their friendship.

That saying you were ""tired"" is often read as a polite way of saying you aren't interested."

CPTSD,foijafd,t1_foiegdi,1587788044.0,"> When you get the laptop, send an email to that person who offered to bring it letting them know that you received it and sincerely thank them for their help and say something along the lines of “Hope it wasn’t a big inconvenience for you to ship it, followed by letting them know how much you appreciate their offer to drop it off, especially since it was so far out of their way. That way you’ve not only thanked them, but acknowledged how nice it was of them to offer to go out of their way. No need to explain anything further.

Thanks for this suggestion. I'll followup with them when I receive it, and thank them for the nice offer as well. Anything that helps me stop playing it over and over, is very welcomed so will definitely try this out."
CPTSD,foii7gi,t1_foibzjf,1587787263.0,"> It's such an amazing blessing to not have to deal with a bunch of other people's emotions all the time

That really sounds ideal, and I'm happy that you found that space for yourself. I'm not sure many people are aware of how much they expect others to deal with their emotions. Even in professional settings.

My goal with this current job is to learn enough skills to be able to work remotely with limited contact with others. I know it sounds deliberately self-isolating, but I believe a career where I can focus on data/figures and have limited opportunities to have to figure out other people's emotions would be best."
CPTSD,foii0sq,t1_foidspm,1587787136.0,"> This is me! But instead of responding negatively I’ve noticed people don’t want to confront me. I’m often described as “really nice.” And I think for the most part people don’t want to hurt my feelings. But I wish they would tell me. Because after I make a mistake like this I’ve noticed people retreat and our relationship becomes strained. I wish more people were trauma informed. Thanks for sharing this.

Yes, I do pick up on them retreating, even via email but can't always figure out why. Because the idea of someone inconviencing themself just to help me seems suspicious to me, that I believe it must be another attack.

I'm hoping that post-Covid more people will understand more about isolation and trauma. 

I have one friend to run things by with before I sent things sometimes, and she said why did you say that? O.o etc...so it helps to have others, but I want to get better to the point where I can do this myself."

Whew, yes. This is a great point. I've definitely lived in a way that not ""acting the right way"" meant that you were going to be denied your basic needs, or be attacked, etc.

Trusting that is so difficult, especially in times like this, but I desperately need to live a life authentically and like you said trusting that it will be ok."
