StrongCurves,fqmgoax,t1_fqmfzkg,1589477146.0,Yea it's a lot. For a 135 pound woman its 202 grams a day. I get 50g from 2 scoops of protein powder and the 2 salmon filets give me 44g and 3 eggs will give me around 20g and all that adds up to 114g then I add some chickpeas and artichoke hearts and avocado to make it to around 150g
