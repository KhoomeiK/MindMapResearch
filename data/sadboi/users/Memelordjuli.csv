Im sorry for your situation, but youre not the only one. there are people who have it worse than you and people who have it better. while having priority queue sounds like a good idea, there would be no way to enforce it. would people submit medical information to prove that they are high risk? and everyone could say theyre shopping for someone whos high risk. 

just because a $650 order got cut down to $400 doesnt mean it took us less time to shop. actually, with stuff thats out of stock, it creates more work for us. we have to check the inventory, check any other spots where it might be if the inventory says we have it in stock, and if we cant find it, then we have to figure out a substitute, which is hard considering the limited inventory. youd be in the same situation if you physically went into the store, we do our best to substitute what we can. 

shop from home is not the only method of getting food. my grandmother is also extremely high-risk. I do the shopping for her when Im off work since Im already exposed in the store. my parents then drive the groceries to her, leave them in her garage, then she goes and retrieves them after a few hours. I encourage you to do the same thing instead of trying to get lucky. its a shitty situation, especially since my grandma lives a few hours away, but its what has to be done. 

everyone treating the situation like its survival of the fittest is why there is nothing in stock because everyones trying to stockpile. there is no actual food shortage, if everyone shopped like normal there would be no problems.

either Im a weird lightweight, or maybe this person just isnt a regular user and doesnt have a high tolerance.

or they made it all up trying to sound cool ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

Libertarian,fgfmlo6,t1_fgf9p9m,1580742715.0,the current system is fucked up for sure. I just dont think legalizing drugs like heroin is the solution. Id rather see decriminalization but put people who get caught in rehab.
Libertarian,fgfm93j,t1_fgfhb26,1580742469.0,"what Im more concerned about is if its legal, itd be able to be bought and sold legally. and people would definitely get into the business, knowing all it takes is one time for someone to be a customer for life. they marketed cigarettes as healthy things, it could totally happen with heroin or any other drug. we do have much better education today of course, but people would still fall victim. 

yeah, of course, itd still happen whether or not it was legal, but it being so readily available imo would normalize it and people might forget how bad it is."
Libertarian,fgeqq0l,t1_fgdbk8r,1580706768.0,"I agree with decriminalization of all drugs, but not legalization.

due to the extreme addictiveness of heroin and other drugs so much advantage would be taken of people who need medical help. all it takes is a few curious/vulnerable/desperate people to try it out and theyre hooked for life. then were paying their hospital bills when they OD. 

decriminalization is great, but drug abuse is still a problem and needs to be seen as such. I fear that legalization will normalize it and itll start to be marketed as a good thing. companies will do anything for money. look what they did with cigarettes.

while Im all for live and let live, we shouldnt encourage harmful behavior just because we can."
MandelaEffect,fgenkos,t3_exk3l2,1580704104.0,"this one is possibly super obscure, but the song ""Turn  Up the Radio"" by OK Go. https://youtu.be/UX2SRgr5Wg8

I SWEAR I remember hearing this song waaaaaaaay before it was released in 2014. I remember being in the car as a little kid and hearing it in the car, on commercials, everywhere. But even looking it up now, the song isnt even super popular. The song spiked in popularity recently because it was in an episode of Mr Robot.

Is it possible that theres a popular song Im forgetting that sounds similar?"

conspiracy,fg0s0qs,t1_fg0pp16,1580413881.0,"this is what Hillary said: 
""She's the favorite of the Russians, they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far, and that's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not, because she's also a Russian asset,""

there is nothing in this sentence that hints that it is an opinion. there is no ""I think... I feel..."" etc. while what she said IS an opinion, it is PRESENTED as fact. this is an important distinction you are struggling to make. if someone with no background knowledge of the situation read that, they would believe it to be fact. and thats the problem. 

if she said ""I think"" or ""I feel"" this would be an entirely different situation. additionally, she has refused to retract the statement. even if she came out at a later date and clarified that it was just her opinion, there would be no case. but she didnt. 

since there is absolutely no factual evidence to back up Hillarys claim, that would mean that she is lying. and like you just quoted, ""Defamation is essentially a lie..."""

I hope to god youre a troll. Im not going to repeat myself again, but I suggest you read this:

https://thelawdictionary.org/article/slander-protected-first-amendment/"
conspiracy,fg0navk,t1_fg0m20a,1580411247.0,"while it may have been opinion, Hillary stated it as fact. 

here is what she said:
""She's the favorite of the Russians, they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far, and that's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not, because she's also a Russian asset,""

not once did Hillary express that this was just an opinion, she stated it as fact despite there being nothing to back it up. 

heres more info from thelawdictionary:
""However, not all statements that can harm a person’s reputation count as defamation. Basically, the statement has to be a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts to be defamatory. Spreading a lie that an individual is on a sex offender registry, for example, when you know that that individual is not on any such registry would count as defamation. Merely expressing a negative opinion about that same individual’s character and temperament, however, would not count as defamation since such opinions are not being presented as facts.""

since Hillary DID present her opinion as fact, that last sentence means nothing here."
conspiracy,fg0kryj,t1_fg0jeth,1580409789.0,"whats your proof that Tulsi is an asset in any way to Russia, even as just a ""useful idiot""? couldnt just about everyone be considered a Russian asset by this definition?

anyways, the implied meaning of Russian asset in this case is not a ""useful idiot."" Hillary knew what she was saying and was attempting to use the tensions between the US and Russia to her advantage. when you hear ""Russian asset"" today, you think of some corrupt/shady person doing treasonous things behind the scenes, not your neighbor Joe who stays out of politicis.

in this case it may be hard since Hillary never explicitly named Tulsi, but in any other case where there was a name it would 100% be defamation, unless of course there was proof."
conspiracy,fg0izf9,t1_fg0gr8k,1580408759.0,"defamation isnt protected by the first amendment. ""free speech"" isnt always free. instead of shouting ""muh free speech!"" at everything, maybe you should learn how the first amendment actually works before making yourself look like an idiot.

from thelawdictionary, defamation is defined: ""Defamation is essentially a lie that can harm a person’s reputation. However, not all statements that can harm a person’s reputation count as defamation. Basically, the statement has to be a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts to be defamatory.""

since Hillary never named Tulsi AFAIK, it might be hard to get this particular lawsuit to stick. but defamation is not covered by the first amendment."
