narcissisticparents,foiqt2i,t3_g6eazb,1587794063.0,"I'm Puerto Rican. I know exactly how you feel. My parents are both classic examples of this trope. I didn't realize just how devasting and narcissistic their behavior was until I educated myself on how parents should act with their kids and regardless of culture being emotionally and physically abused is not okay.

 My parents came from poor backgrounds and made something of themselves in the US. My mom has an undiagnosed schizo-effective mental illness. That being said, she has a lot of trauma and a lot of issues to work out. She is extremely religious and very volitile. If she feels threatened, she almost takes on a new personality and lashes out physically or emotionally. In our culture, we have to show respect to our parents, even if that means submitting to abusive, dillusional behavior.

She would embarrass my dad in front of us, by speaking of their sex life, his insecurities, and his own traumas. She has even gaslighted him, claiming he raped her when in actuality, he was asking for a divorce. Her behavior has broken my dad, which had lead to him to act out aggressively when I was a kid. He has calmed down significantly and now seems so broken. My mom really placed a distance between us and our dad. It feels weird to speak to him. Apparently in Pop- Latino culture, the dominating female role is normalized. So when I spoke to other Latino friends about this, they just laughed it off as normal.

My mom likes to also speak of traumatic events that happened to my siblings as if they were her burdens to carry. She has walked into our rooms saying she will kill herself and has distanced us from our extended family. When coming out to her about my sexual abuse, she thought she should forcibly make me come out as a whore and bisexual. She believes she can control our sexualities, our beliefs, and our own traumas. My Dad used to enable her, now I have a hard time trusting or even speaking to him.

Being Latino, we see this stereotype that Latin families have to be like this, but in communities that are so unproportionally plaugued by years of systematic oppression, we see that statistically our people choose work over education to deal with poverty (which many Latino and Black families disproportionately live in). The lack of opportunity does not allow for children to grow out of the cycle of abuse which creates even worse families. Education and the equal opportunity to resources allows at-risk families to better their situations and better the lives of their children. There are many historical reasons as to why we see this negative sterotype be perpetuated, but break the cycle. That is all you can do.

(The Case of Gabriel Fernandez is a good example of this explanation.)"

I was so used to this behavior from her that one morning on my way to work in high school she texted me telling me how she basically had the cops almost called on her for suicidal idealization and I just said, ""Well dude, you ever planning on changing and getting help?"" She lived in a very strict household, so I understand how she couldn't, but I lived in a similar situation; had a job, was taking medication, and seeing a psychologist in school regularly. I know it's not right to compare, but she did this so often and appeared so jovial the next moment that you had to wonder if she was genuine once she received all this attention.
