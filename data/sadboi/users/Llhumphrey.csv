I am hoping that when i start on O it will be better. Right now and for last decade, i just barely live, in my bed all day. Your story inspires me though! Thank you"

MultipleSclerosis,f5bx0dp,t3_dn6v3d,1572126980.0,"About 9 weeks ago i had my first attack of optic neuritisis, resulting in total liss of sight in my right eye. My MS clinic sent me to my Ophthalmologist for specific testing and an exam before an MRI. The eye doctor could tell that my optoc nerves were inflamed big time.  Luckily with prednisone, it came back! I still have pain and some symptoms but i can see!  If i were you, i would go to an eye doctor...any eye doctor that you can get into to see, like this weelend because they can test and even write dx for tx. Oh BTW, I only took 3 days of 1000mg prednisone orally. It was way way lower than my previous IV solumedrol tx's and no taper, but it worked. Good luck & take care"

I need it and just coming across your note has maybe saved me from myself for the night. Thank you and thank you for making me feel like i am not totally useless always...just really sick. Another note I see ypu on on Ocrevus. I am to choose my next DMT, but really scary side effects and my luck in life is totally Eff'd (really good & really bad odds so far). Could you perhaps please help me woth your experience? I apologize if i am too intrusive. I am still trying to figure this out. thx"

MultipleSclerosis,f4x6nlg,t1_f4u5r9j,1571862921.0,"Oh no i win on the daily breakdown chart...if we are keeping score. I slept till noon. Many hours after my mother began waking me..nuce at first, then into the usual, i am a waste, never get out of bed yadda yadda.  I actually had plans to take my dog to get groomed today, but I just couldn't bring myself to get up and do it. I do not know why i am so horrible and can't do anything...like, ever.  So just the usual nothingness. I do have to go to neuro tomorrow to pick my new DMT. It has been a great process...do you want to gey breast cancer, pml or herpes?? Or all 3? Eff the side effects! May I ask what you are on if any? And where in italy are you? I have been trying to take my moms on a trip there for over 12 yearsnow. I gave to her as 60th birthday gift, but sicky shitty me has not made it happen yet. I almost booked for this past summer and again for Oct, but never happened yet..."

I have been having the same feelings of isolation and total utter loneliness for longer than i care to admit. I am always free. I no longer have friends, a job or any hobbies. My life is essentially me just here waiting... So, yes i would love to chat with you. Try to hang in there...go grab an amazing pizza! Try to take care,"
