headphones,fqqdm8s,t3_gj7rr4,1589563697.0,"Hi,

My mom has had her SRH1440s for several years, and yesterday, tragedy struck: the metal band linking the left ear to the head strap came detached from the socket in the phone. I was wondering if anyone any experience with fixing this, or even if there's a place where I can find a detailed layout of the inside of the headphones so I can figure out how to securely reconnect the two pieces. They're taped up right now, but still wobbly, and I'd like to do it right.

Thanks!"

Clarinet,flc2l5q,t3_fnsjq3,1585018326.0,"I've found just making a list of all the stuff I want to work on for the day (and about how long I want to spend on each bit) has been very rewarding. It's so much easier to keep practicing when you're feeling less than euphoric about the idea of work when you can just cycle through a bunch of different stuff. I've generally not been working on any one thing for more than 15-20 mins at a time. Also, if you put down the date for every day you do this, you get a pretty handy log. 

Having had to come back home from college, this has been the only thing really keeping me going now that all ensemble playing is out the window. It also helps to realize how much there is to work on, and how much time you can put in just by working on a bunch of little bits here and there. And try to warm up with fundamentals instead of diving right into the deep end, if you're not already doing that. Trying to work on anything hard before being completely warmed up has certainly never worked for me!

Best of luck!"
