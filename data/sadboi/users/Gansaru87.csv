\- Create a second Discord account. I just made a non-verified one and invited it to the server.

\- Install VB-Audio virtual audio cable.

\- I use a second web browser that I have installed, but don't always use. In this case I use Chrome day-to-day but I installed Firefox just for this.

\- In windows down, go to Sound >> App volume and device preferences. From there change the output of Firefox to the Virtual audio cable.

\- In Discord through the web interface, change the audio input to the Virtual audio cable, and set it to auto-detect audio with maxed out sensitivity. Don't worry about the audio output, but to get rid of any feedback loops right click on the tab in Firefox and ""Mute"" the tab. 

Any audio played in Firefox will play through the virtual audio cable, which inputs into Discord. Make sure your discord channel is set to the highest quality. You may need to adjust volumes and such but it works pretty well for us, I usually just throw on a loop or playlist of creepy background/ambient music that fits what's happening."
