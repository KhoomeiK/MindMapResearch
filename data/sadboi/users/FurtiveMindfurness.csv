On top of that nobody was giving answers and every procedure was delayed and I can't help to feel they were just milking me to charge the insurance.

I was hoping maybe someone here would know a bit about malpractice because I read on Nolo (sorry, not sure how trustworthy that is) that injury can also be unnecessary medical bills due to the negligence, so I wanted to  fight them, because beyond what they did at first, if they had been competent nothing else would have been needed.

intj,eyi0cns,t1_eygufci,1567095585.0,"> Do you truly believe that if an intj wants to divorce, they can't just take their belongings and go live somewhere else till it's done? That a piece of paper will stop them somehow? 

I did that myself bc my husband was abusive so no, that is not what I'm saying. No piece of paper prevents anyone from leaving not just an intj, and I wouldn't want to hold anyone hostage anyway. 

I see a difference in living with a person together like roommates and whether at some sensible point you willingly become a family/entity in the eyes of the law, share your assets, share your debts, etc. you become a household BY CHOICE. You think it doesn't make a difference to how committed a person is, I think it does, because it changes your situation quite a bit more than just sharing a lease. **So no, I won't treat it as being as serious because the benefits and obligations of each option to each other are NOT the same**. I don't get any security from it because I'm well aware that making the decision to marry still doesn't change the fact the relationship can fail at a later point. It doesn't necessarily mean you weren't serious when you made it either. Life happens. But if you claim early you don't wanna take that step at all **ever**, then we're just not compatible, period, none is right or wrong the way I see it. Maybe he's not into me that much, maybe like you he doesn't see the point, it's irrelevant. What matters is that we have different goals. So either someone gives up their goal, which is bs, or we can just move on to find partners with the same goal.

It's not much different than someone who wants to swing partners/have an open relationship and tells you saying you're exclusive doesn't mean anything. Maybe to you it does. Am I going to roll my eyes at you and say, ""what is the difference, I can cheat on you anyway if I wanted, might as well let me do it in your face""?  No, you just go and find someone who is into monogamy, not someone who wants to have multiple partners. Because what you both want is different and that's ok, but nobody has to suffer because of it. 

In this post I just express my frustration that he won't be clear about what he wants. I'm not on a schedule, but I'd appreciate to know if he's already decided marriage isn't for him **at all**, because it clashes with what I want. I didn't come here for you to roll your eyes and judge me on my beliefs. If you think it's the same thing, you do you and let everyone else live. I'm not gonna force marriage on anyone, I'll just find someone that wants the same thing I do.


P.S.

>Coming from a broken marriage, you get to understand that it's only trouble and for people's eyes.

Only if you like broad and stereotyped generalizations. I also know people that are very happily married, not just ""in people's eyes"", and that is what I strive for. He doesn't have to. I can just keep looking for someone with my same ideals because I'm secure AS I AM, not because of him. It all boils down to compatibility and shared goals."

intj,ey8zx2i,t1_ey8sigw,1566932100.0,"Haha yes it's me hun! (?) 

Yes your gf story is pretty much my story. But it was my dad. My mom was submissive, unhappy, helpless her whole life. Tension in my house was something was always about to explode. I was not allowed to express negative emotions, I wouldn't talk about any of that to anyone in the family or outside. To make matters worse the bf I moved abroad for ended up being a narcissist and I suffered abuse for 4 years until I put all the pieces together and understood. I guess I was lucky that as people pleasing as I can be, deep down I know my worth so at one point it finally clicked that it was my life or his. Anyway, yes, I have very thin skin. I've had some people in my family and a few great friends that will encourage me to the end of the world when I casually see them, but also I lived 24/7 under the roof with people that mocked me, belittled me, judged me, put me down, etc. Every day I have to make it a point to not take things personal, to work on re-learning how to read people's intentions, etc. I told him I had a thin skin from the beginning so he's very careful of not making stupid jokes that could hurt my feelings. In fact that was one of the first things about him that made me go like ""Wow, he really listened."" (Sad, I know :P) But I wouldn't like to know he censors himself of bringing up things that ARE important to him and should be discussed, either. Balance is key. I feel he's self-aware and aware enough to know what to say or what would make me feel bad depending on how he says it. Personally I think I can take it as long as, like you say, it's presented abstractly, or in ""I"" statements, rather than accusatory tones. More like, you know, ""us"" vs. ""the problem"" 

Those last two paragraphs seem really on point. I appreciate you taking the time of describing more or less how you guys see things. I know ofc he's not your clone, but it's a good guideline of things that I may have never considered about how his train of thought may be. Thank you, really."

Yes I may love gestures and compliments. I also was with a person that was all that and also abused me. I’ve learned from that. And I know better. Nowhere in my post have I said my issue was with the way he showed his affection.

My boyfriend might not be the flower guy but I embraced it. I learned to see his love in his reliability and actions for me. I got to get the cake and eat it too because for my birthday he did go there for me and got me some flowers. I recognized it as a treat and was grateful and pleasantly surprised since I wasn’t expecting him to do something in another language than his, neither I do today. I accept him the way he is because he is a great person I can count on and makes me happy, that’s all I need. The balloons are just an extra I can live without. 
 
I don’t “want” him to go all the way I’m not trying to produce an action on his part. I’d like to know if he wants a serious future with me or he’s just comfortable up to here. Balloons and flowers have nothing to do with it. And as for “the paper” we just disagree on what the meaning of it is. If it’s so unimportant then why so adverse to do it? I’ll tell you why, because you’re risking a lot doing it, you don’t have an easy exit and that’s why it weights heavily.  So if you’re quick to rage quit a relationship you’re not going to be attracted to, but once you are confident a person is a good partner to grow old with that doesn’t weight so heavily because you’re willing to put in the work.

Just for the record, I don't want a wedding ceremony, maybe a little backyard cookout but that's it.

We could argue back and forth about this, you could be right that it can be seen as insecurity, and I could also say, putting your relationship on the books is also a step an already committed couple takes to gain certain perks such as being able to be the one taking care of your loved one at a hospital if something happened (first thing I could think of) and to make it serious that they don't have a foot in and a foot out anymore, you can't just rage quit. That's why it's so important to do it with the right person. Also, following the next step logic... I'd like to call someone ""husband"" one day, not have a boyfriend for life. I understand if you can't relate or if it seems too sentimental. I don't see the paper about stress, I feel people do it because they want to. 

That is why I'd like to know if idk, even living together someday crossed his mind. I'm in the dark. If he's never gonna do it well, that is valid.

I already go about not saying much because I'm subconsciously afraid of having to do clean up myself because of all my past experiences.

Yes I can do it by myself, I’m enough, complete.

I wish he would like to be him doing that, maybe he doesn’t, I don’t know. Whatever happens I know I’ll be okay, I’m not about to force anyone to do anything or give any manipulative ultimatums.

intj,ey6pczv,t1_ey6osfs,1566860872.0,"Thanks I won’t. I don’t even want marriage right now, I have stuff I want to get done first. I’m saving for properties to manage so that can be my living and (sorry if this sounds selfish) I don’t want my living to be marital property. So even for me it doesn’t make sense. Like someone else pointed out I just wanna know if there’s a potential for our timelines going similar ways. Probably by the time marriage is a card on the table with this guy or any I’ll hopefully have it more clear? 

I swear I like children but I don’t see myself raising one of my own, at all, and I’m already 30. I rather have pets. This world is already overpopulated, polluted, corrupted...if I were to raise someone I’d rather give a chance at a good life to someone who is already here and adopt. Right now that’s how I feel and I feel very strongly and sure about it."
intj,ey6oou1,t1_ey6nnx9,1566860452.0,"Thank you that was very very helpful, actually. I also don’t understand why people freak out about certain things. Like, I didn’t say I wanna marry tomorrow, I just want you to be aware, that’s it. Cause if it’s not your thing let me know now before it hurts even more to break up."
intj,ey6o8rq,t1_ey6mi6a,1566860178.0,"It could be, I feel other INTJs have raised good points too. 

But yes that could be a possibility and I’m aware of it."

Thanks."
intj,ey6nn1w,t1_ey6lcs8,1566859806.0,"Oh no, he hasn’t gotten any husband privileges as of now. We don’t even live together. I wouldn’t let it get to that point. 

As far as kids I don’t think I want any and he has two (9/10), he said he doesn’t want more and tbh I didn’t feel bad about it at all. But it looks like where we disagree is whether marriage is further commitment or whether “you can commit without having to be married” which I think no, being legally married is WAY more of a commitment which is why you wanna think about it really well. 

Plus just for the record I don’t even wanna church marriage, just city hall and maybe a night cookout/backyard little party, done."
intj,ey6n082,t1_ey6k08i,1566859430.0,"He does that for me sometimes. I’m not complaining about any of that really, I consider myself lucky and I’m grateful. I’m pretty easy to please. 

I just feel I’ve hit a wall of uncertainty, like he’s put a ceiling to how far the relationship can go. I wouldn’t consider what I told him a tantrum. I just told him that I wanted to be clear and communicate that at some point in my life, when the time is right, if it makes sense, I’d like to remarry. That was it. I needed to know whether he’s never going to or whether he just doesn’t want now, because if it’s the former I have a decision to take."
Stoicism,ey6mk66,t1_ey6jzqh,1566859144.0,"Thank you on your perspective. I do paint on oils, I’m trying to save to start owning properties. I used to volunteer often but I’m getting treated for MDD and GAD and if I put too much on my plate I overheat so I gotta take it slow. Nevertheless I do some things. I catch up with my BFFs every now and then. I’m thinking of getting an EMT-P license next year and see where that takes me. Again, I know I can do all this, I’m introverted so I do enjoy my me time, but I do have a need for belonging in some unit I can’t seem to shake off on top of that. I guess I can just focus on my stuff and hopefully new things come my way."
intj,ey6lzlx,t1_ey6i50o,1566858743.0,"This is what my gut tells me from what I’ve seen of him. He likes to make sure he’s taking the “most efficient” “most effective” “logical” decision every time. I can see it mainly in his workplace context. This is why I’m wary to jump the gun on throwing the whole thing away, mainly because I feel we work great together. I’m not in a rush, I guess probing is annoying but it was necessary once to make it clear that I DO know what I want someday. I just wanted to know well, are we on the same page more or less with long term goals?

Could you explain what you mean by this?: “Decide to change careers. Set a goal and start working toward it. Whatever you need to do to start collapsing future potentialities into a trajectory that your SO can reason by” 

Also yes I try to be very conscientious of the little ways he reaches out. Sometimes my therapist helps me see them but most of the time I can be appreciative of them easily."

Honestly if that’s the case why approach me, introduce me to his family, his children (he said I’m the first one he’s done that with) take me to family reunions. He was the one that set the relationship thing on Facebook for everyone to see (I know it’s not that important but just saying) 

And now it’s like I’ve hit an asymptote of sorts"

intj,ey6jsc5,t1_ey6h9jm,1566857201.0,"Here’s what I told him after he casually said “I don’t see the point of marriage” (his parents are divorced, he’s had all bad examples for relationships around all his life, me sort of too until a few years ago, so it’s understandable) 

“Hey, about (what he said), I just felt I needed to let you know that at some point I was expecting to get there, if it made sense of course. Sometime, no timeline. At this point it doesn’t make much sense for neither of us anyway. But I’m bringing it up because I need you to know that at some point in my life I’d like to get married, to the right person and for the right reasons”. 

Also because I needed to know whether that comment meant “it’s never gonna happen” or “it just doesn’t make sense “NOW”. 

I feel he got freaked out at first like I was chasing him with a ring. Then the next day he called me and said something within the lines of “idk, you know, I don’t wanna waste your time, nothing is set in stone” but honestly idk what to do with that. For the moment I figured I’m gonna keep enjoying the day to day but make sure I focus more on me and my projects and not fall into clinginess."
intj,ey6j47q,t1_ey6gd52,1566856783.0,"Oh he’s put effort. Since we have been dating and I’ve told him I appreciate words/gestures, he’s opened a little and he compliments me here and there and got more comfortable flirting back. For my birthday in June I wasn’t expecting anything but “the gift” but he actually wrapped my whole cubicle in wrapping paper, got me a balloon and I received flowers. He also made a reservation at my favorite restaurant before I even asked. 

We had a conversation not too long ago and when I said I wasn’t expecting that (but made my whole month) I think he felt a little bad because he said “Really?? You thought I wasn’t gonna do anything at all??” And I was like well yea, that’s what you taught me to expect (non-accusatory tone, he’s been drilling on me from the beginning he’s “not a flowers type of guy, I don’t say ilu I show it with actions” etc )

But yes he makes sure he does things in my language here and there every now and then, and that’s all I need. I told him I didn’t want him to do anything he didn’t feel and he said he didn’t and that he actually likes it now because he likes seeing my reaction. So no complaints on that end. He’s done his part and I try to do mine by being too cheesy or nagging him (that’s why I’m venting here a bit, sorry, for some feedback)"
intj,ey6i3x4,t1_ey6hdvp,1566856127.0,"Lol. No, sorry I got too metaphorical. There was no message."
infp,ey6cw95,t1_ey6bnoy,1566852665.0,"On the contrary thanks so much for the thorough perspective. I mean without trying to compare too much... here's you together for a year and he's talking ""we"" in future tense, same timeline, mine shows affection in his ways (which I've learned to recognize and appreciate so no conflict there) but there's still no ""we"" on the horizon, and it stresses me out. It's this mixed message where he shows me he cares, I know his family, I know his kids (which he had never introduced to anyone before) but there's absolutely no mention of idk, some sort of cooperative project of any kind. 
It makes me feel I could be out and heartbroken any day now. He's told me before he doesn't NEED me, but WANTS me in his life, which stung but at the same time that is how it should be, dependency is bad and I'm not trying to foster that. But that also keeps creeping up in my mind. He does need space as well. And I know there's a shell to break too because he's acknowledged that his guard is always up. He was cheated on, he doesn't have much trust on women anymore. I'm not sure how much trust he has on me even though I'd never do something like that. 
I feel I come from an abuse background and yet here I am opening and exposing all my fragile heart bits but it's so, so hard for him."

infp,ey64d6b,t3_cvr760,1566847150.0,"I've been dating an INTJ guy for a year now. We have the same sense of humor, we read each other like a book. He's super respectful towards me, we flirt a lot. I'm incredibly attracted to him. He's independent, I am too because I don't want to be dependent, however I am attached. Sometimes I wonder if I'm more attached than him.

My current struggle is that, even though I come from a background of abuse, I'm still cracking open whatever I have left and exposing myself to more emotional damage while he's still too mysterious about what he envisions for our relationship (he had a rocky ex relationship too). I feel loved, not like he doesn't take us seriously, but at the same time it's like I'm hanging from a string and I've hit a wall with how much I can make him talk, bringing it up again is gonna feel like nagging and probably annoy him. All I can do is keep seeing where it goes for a while more I guess."

AnxietyDepression,ex3ffw1,t1_ex2t042,1565984715.0,"I started with the Headspace app, they have a student option for $9 for the whole year or something like that, not expensive at all. Then just do the 5 minute audios. There's a similar one called Meditation Studio and one called Insight Timer where people can upload their own audios but I didn't like that one, too much background music distract me. The other two apps generally have one or very few people so they are consistent on who you hear guiding the meditation. They can be as short as 5 minutes or 15 minutes, and they are grouped into basics, some for anxiety, some for depression, etc etc. I recommend headspace. 

If you can't do that either, then you probably know internet is your friend. I'd hit YouTube next, and finally instructional articles. Find the book you want and go see if the library has it to borrow. The whole thing is just sitting 5-10 min a day and focusing on nothing. The breath makes it easier to give you something to pay attention to"". When you notice you start to think or feel things, like ""what am I going to have for dinner"" or ""that thing that went wrong today"" you just supposed to (gently, not in a punishing way) sort of stop yourself and take your attention back to your breath. That's all there is to it as for the basics. Don't worry whether you're doing it right, just sit and be there with yourself, in silence, few minutes a day, and bring your mind back to breathing if you see yourself starting to think stuff. 

And yes you are on the right track, happiness comes from within, not from external factors. External stuff (relationships, accomplishments, stuff, etc) is good, but see it as extras, the icing on the cake. You have to be okay with yourself just for existing. You don't owe anyone anything, you aren't supposed to look a certain way for no one, and so on. Once you can start fostering and encouraging all that self love, you can feel at peace and just welcome the things that come to you, good or bad, in a different light. I hope that makes sense."
