It's more of visual than physical disincentive, plus it won't hurt your bois snoot.

Every time he does jump on you/guests, give him a whack and with a negative tone in your voice say ""no""

Newfs are highly sensitive to voice plus a jumpy 70+ kg animal is something you want to nip in the bud right away.

I'd apply the same for nipping if you don't have paper again clearly and negatively say ""no"" or ""ah ah""
