From now on we will be correcting people about BH's pronouns. I'm going to be upfront with you, the main reason the rules were like that in the first place was because people get really heated when people correct them for gender usage. We have decided to ignore that from now on and if people escalate it they will be banned. I hope from now on you won't experience these issues and we appreciate what you have done. I hope you will start to feel comfortable in the community aswell. much love! <3"
