AskWomen,fqr9330,t3_gk2rxw,1589579883.0,"When I was 19, I was married. It was bad. One night, it wasn’t safe for me to go home but I had just moved to my ex’s military base and only had 1 friend. Her and her husband took me in. I spent 1 night and almost regretted it. I found out that she was physically abusing him. I felt absolutely sick. 

I made an anonymous report. Nothing ever came of it. I moved away a little while later and didn’t think about either of them because that night was just....traumatic. I got divorced. So did they, apparently. I ran into him at a bar 4 years later. He has an alcohol problem and a thing for picking up women in bars. I tried to be a friend to him but ended up catching feelings. He was manipulative and treated me awful. I realized, in that moment, that even though abuse is never justified sometimes it is two sided. I’m very careful where I place my sympathy now."
