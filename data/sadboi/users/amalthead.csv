Victims of abuse suffer so much pain for their whole lives. He was in treatment for CPTSD but it wasn't enough.

This community provides that support for people who are between doctors, or between appointments, or are simply looking to share their experience. 

Let's face it, the internet can be a difficult place to find verified sources for things far simpler than a mental illness. Scientific journals may hold some good answers but then you start getting into issues like the strength of the study, and are you looking at a reputable source, are you reading a legitimate medical study or some weirdo psychological study (looking at you, Bipolar is an Anger Disorder). Honestly, I'd rather look for support here than dive into that mess... And I'm someone who is paid to read medical journals all day!"

In my experience, sometimes loved ones blame you for your mental health symptoms because it's easier to call you a brat or an asshole than have to acknowledge that you are actually suffering. Either they do it because they're out of touch (like your mom) or because they're straight up dicks (like your cousin).

bipolar2,ezxrm0w,t3_d2tlqq,1568247882.0,"I get this all the time ughh. I found that the best way to gauge this is just think about if other people approach you romantically, because this just doesn't happen very frequently if you're not physically attractive. I figured this out through helping two of my single guy friends, neither of which thinks they're attractive. The one who is fairly handsome has women develop crushes on him, and has girls talk to him in bars. The other hasn't had a match on tinder in two years. Objective evidence isn't going to make you feel attractive deep down anyways, but it can help you understand what is real (which is my problem).

Edit: I'm a woman and I used to think that guys approach me because I'm a girl and that's it, but apparently if you aren't an attractive woman this never happens either. So if you have a cute doctor crushing on you, I'd bet you're attractive. Again, feeling it is another thing. Good luck OP!"

Everything is beautiful, everything makes sense, everything I want is within my grasp so I start reaching out, making plans. And then the depression hits and I see how stupid I am, how idiotic I was for thinking I could do any of it, and my whole life is pointless. 

Right now I'm sitting in the wreckage of my last hypomanic episode, surrounded by e-mails from potential grad school supervisors and unfinished job letters. It's been weeks since I responded to any e-mails and any progress I would've made has been destroyed. What was the point of going to grad school and following my passion when I can't even handle my easy 9 to 5 job?

Depression takes everything you've worked for and everything you've wanted and twists it into a grey nightmare. You just see what you could've been if you weren't such a miserable pointless person.
