bipolar,fbzynf5,t3_edmfny,1577268898.0,"I’m not doing well right now. I have bipolar type 1 and I’ve been adjusting to my meds for about a year and a half now and it’s still a battle. Today my parents were asking why I was reserved about talking about how I was feeling and I told them that I didn’t feel like my words would be met with empathy or understanding sometimes and it makes me retreat into myself. Well that didn’t go over well at all and they got aggressively defensive and said how of course they care about me because why would they still have me in their life and help me out if they didn’t care about me, which they don’t seem to understand just makes me feel that much more guilty and less like love and more like a burden. I tried to convey that to them and I said “I’m going to have my off days, it’s not always going to be perfect. If I feel bad it’s not always a dosage problem or this or that” idk how to feel, it didn’t end well and now I’m dreading tomorrow which is with my moms side of the family, which are more judgmental and lik to shame me. Idk how I’m going to make it through. Honestly I’m on the verge of a nervous breakdown."
