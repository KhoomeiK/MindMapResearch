I’m really sorry about your family members, cancer is a terrible, awful way to go out. It turns good people into skeletons and always strikes when you aren’t expecting it. Did your grandmother also suddenly get diabetes or have any problems like that? 

They say pancreatic cancer is one of the bad ones because you can’t tell you have it until it’s spread, it’s quiet like that. I don’t think there really are good kinds of cancer but yeah :/"

I thought about getting checked for cancer, my grandfather (lung cancer from smoking), my uncle (rectal cancer from smoking), and now maybe my grandmother might be in trouble. It’s safe to say I will never, ever develop a smoking addiction, besides it being nasty and smelling awful. 

I’m sorry to hear about your experiences with BRCA mutations, cancer fucking sucks. I’m glad you were able to defeat it, though!! I’m a little worried myself because although I’m only 19, my breast tissue tends to be on the lumpy side (although both sides are symmetrical in regards to consistency) and I’ve heard that can be a problem with detecting cancers. My mother gets regular checkups about her breasts because we are sort of the same in that aspect hahaha."

Scientists think it’s actually a form of denial that keeps us alive to think we’re going to live forever. I think the thing about my uncle really shook me up, we weren’t super close because we only met the one time but when he died my mom just kind of fell apart. Cancer is a frothy mouthed, rabid bitch, isn’t it?

I am so sorry that you have had to deal with so many people who lack basic empathy and compassion. I am truly shocked that in every time that you needed help or support the people closest to you and actual medical professionals couldn’t give absolutely any. I feel like you could have a legal case on your hands for the way your GP had treated you because it was extremely uncalled for even if was somehow against her beliefs. She didn’t have the right to patronize you or berate you before, during or after your hospital stay. Your right to bodily autonomy was stripped from you from every corner, from your POS ex, your family members and even your doctors. 

As for recovering from the trauma you’ve been through never mind being sort of pregnant, I hope you can eventually find peace and you can get better eventually. You should speak to some kind of therapist/psychiatrist ASAP because I cannot believe you had to go through something so horrific and go on as if it were nothing.

I’m only 19 years old!! 

Why can’t people butt out of a woman’s personal autonomy and life? I hate the idea that as a woman somehow you are in debt to an imaginary man who will control your body. It enrages me to think about the quantity of women who have been rejected getting hysterectomies because their bodily autonomy is considered irrelevant in regards to what they actually want. 

Maybe eventually I will have children and a husband, or maybe I’ll have none and a wife. Why can’t I decide for myself what I want with my body and when? 

Right now, as a single young woman, I have no inclination to be in a relationship with anyone. I have my degree to work on, my own personal issues that I need to sort through and make amends with. I don’t want to be trapped as an unhappy thirty something year old woman in an unfulfilling marriage with a man I resent for making me unwillingly cease my own aspirations and goals, with kids I regret having.

Being single isn’t a bad thing, in fact it’s an amazing thing. It’s a gift for introspection and discovery.

Like I said, it’s just about letting those feelings die down a bit. My advice is that you should get involved in a lot of fun social things, you can meet amazing friends there and perhaps maybe a guy that you like. Great things happen when you aren’t expecting them.

Also, you should take into account that you yourself are probably great in your own way. Just as she is. You should never try to be someone else or wish to be more like someone else. You are a 100% unique natural occurrence on this planet, you should celebrate that!!

Messiah,fdfcn77,t1_fdfbif9,1578358554.0,"Okay, I can agree with the idea that there’s a lot of things happening at once with the show. There’s a lot of subplots and I think that’s where the lack of fleshing out of the character comes from. But I believe it’s just setting up for the next season, you can’t show all your cards just yet. I also agree that the writing was a bit complicated and hard to follow sometimes. However, I stand by the choice of making the guy who plays the “Messiah” sound the way he does because he’s supposed to sound like an ambiguous, almost like he’s deflecting or playing a role. I think you’re right in regards to the actor’s performance, it is a little bland but I also agree that the show has potential. It’s the first season after all.

Also, the tone and mood of Dracula is wholly different than that of this show. That series was made by Sue Virtue who also did some writing and directing from BBC Sherlock. This series is more comparable to House of Cards or Homeland. Dracula is very well written and I enjoyed it, but at the same time it is also a bit more hokey and has a more humorous tone to it. Also, it strays wildly from the source material by Bram Stoker, which isn’t a bad thing but I found the scene with Lucy Westerna especially egregious in terms of that varying from the source.

I cannot fathom why you would say the acting is terrible, for example the scene with the Israeli agent in the airplane. For me, it is a fantastic example of acting in the series. You can tell how tense and thick the atmosphere is, he’s showing his dominance not through words.

I think, personally, that the guy is an anti-Christ. Like you said, he goes around saying he’s going to preach the word of god but he never does. He’s telling the president himself that he should withdraw all of the troops GLOBALLY, which would be catastrophic. Besides, I think he has a connection to Russia.

news,f60khdg,t3_dhzxdf,1572619525.0,"I agree with you, for the most part. 

But, the reason why all these independent movements are popping up is because of the repression of their culture during the dictatorship. It isn’t a false narrative, because for example in the Canary Islands they weren’t allowed to celebrate carnaval so they had to change the name. Also, if you didn’t agree with Franco, were educated, or not from the same political party you’d be sent for a paseo where they shot you and buried you. 

Fun fact, Spain is the second country in the world with the greatest amount of missing people. 

The fact is, that everyone was repressed."
news,f5wzugt,t1_f3vt3pt,1572533222.0,"Sure, but now Catalonians AREN’T repressed. They are allowed to speak their language, teach it in schools, have it on official, legal documents, etc. Not to mention, Franco was a dictator and repressed EVERYONE in Spain not just the Catalonians. People weren’t allowed to participate in local festivals and traditions or name their kids traditional names from their regions everywhere in Spain. I repeat, that’s what happens in a DICTATORSHIP. 

Spain has given them lots of slaps on the wrist beforehand and warned them several times. Not only Spain has but the EU in general. 

A democratic state should change and adapt according to the passage of time but with the consent of ALL of the people and not just a few who don’t like paying taxes."

My skin isn’t flaky though, I have a very oily skin type (which, ironically people say keeps skin looking young). I’ve been trying to up the amount of water I drink, but even then I have laugh lines unfortunately :/

AskReddit,f4n3kej,t3_dgv1cl,1571685333.0,"I was 17, he was 16.

He was the first real, official boyfriend I ever had. 

I lost it on his twin bed that was way too small for the both of us, his mom and dad were our working and he didn’t have siblings. 

It meant a lot to me, mostly because I was waiting for a person that loved me and I loved. I felt cared for and my concerns didn’t fall on deaf ears. It wasn’t the best sex of my life, but it wasn’t bad either.

I’m glad I lost it that way, even if things didn’t turn out well between us and I wouldn’t have had it any other way."
