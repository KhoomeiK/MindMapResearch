UnresolvedMysteries,fn6xkga,t3_fztm10,1586709307.0,"While certainly not the prevailing opinion here, this could (theoretically) be mostly natural causes. 

First: how many parents have we seen on here and in other areas of life say ""my kid never does x"" only to find out that yup, they totally do x. 

Second: how many of us and people we know have suddenly developed a hobby or a willingness to try a hobby when dating or even simply interested in someone with a hobby? 

So here's my thought:

Gloria is walking to her errands (no car, no record of taxi, walking more common in Europe than the US). Some of her friends (the ones she stays with, for instance) see her and insist she come with them for a day of fun. 

This day of fun ends up at a spot in the woods for drinking and hanging out. (Campfire drinking and snogging is a pastime many youths do outside of major urban areas). 

Gloria, drunk, wanders off. The others (also drunk) don't notice or miscommunication and leave. She dies of hypothermia in a crevice somewhere. A few years later, predators and snow fall and melt move bits of her to a place where people find her, especially the skull, which is relatively mobile. 

Conclusion: obviously, there's a lot of holes and a lot made out of whole cloth here. I would argue, however, that it's at least as plausible as an unidentified murderer(or even suspect) that transports and kills her. 

Additionally, death by accident in the woods is a much more likely cause of death than murder, just in general. 

All that being said, the social worker angle certainly needs exploring and I hope the police did so in the initial investigation."
