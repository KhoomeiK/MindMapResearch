I am in no way invalidating your experience, particularly since you didn't share much (and that's your right!), but it never hurts to get a second opinion.

A month or two ago, I started a wonderful job. I am well-utilized, well-paid, and have really nice coworkers. Nobody knows I'm bipolar. The combined factors of it getting to be ""that time of the year"" (ffs, objectively, I LOVE THE HOLIDAYS!!! My brain does not love the transition into winter), and also a local natural disaster that lasted roughly two weeks, and I started tanking. I wasn't really FEEL feeling it, just like fatigue, creativity out the window, but most  critically of all, GARBAGE MEMORY. JUST GARBAGE. My closest coworker, and my boss, both were noticing. Until finally I had to admit, ""I struggle with depression"". And my coworker was a sweetie, very supportive, saying she does, too, and has been extra-patient with me.

The really shitty thing is, I do not tolerate antidepressants that significantly increase serotonin levels. Triggers catastrophically bad migraines. I'm already on a solid dose of bupropion (and more than that makes me jittery/jumpy/anxious). My psychiatrist suggested a large daily dose of fish oil. I have no idea if it's placebo effect or not, but I think it's helping. I'm climbing back up.
