BPD,fpjc9og,t1_fpiw4jb,1588663334.0,"remember that some teenagers can present as borderline even when they're not, because they haven't fully learned how to regulate their emotions. You can't even diagnose someone with BPD until they're an adult. It's likely these kids are suffering from some sort of distress, and they relate to the tiktoker. I'd rather people become more aware of the symptoms of BPD, and normalize it, then keep us in boxes. ""Everyone's a bit crazy"" so to speak."
NPD,fp51zj9,t3_gb6q2n,1588313757.0,"being able to admit flaws and weaknesses is a huge one.

NPD,fp13hs2,t1_foyyrhu,1588223387.0,"Not entirely true. I have BPD so i have very strong feelings for people. But because my personality is blurry, my loyalty shifts very easily. I basically fall in love with whoever i spend time with. this makes it difficult to love just one person in the traditional, monogamous sense."
NPD,fowr2ao,t3_g9u98e,1588125342.0,"I have NPD and BPD...this person seems to be soooo deeply entrenched in his forms of supply that he doesn't even know who he is. He has to figure out what he wants out of life; supply will come and go, but he'll never be truly happy. Until he wakes up and sees what's directly in front of him, he'll continue to abuse people until there's nothing left of them.

He is definitely abusing you, and your mental health WILL suffer if you stay with him. Get out before it's too late. It doesn't seem like anyone has give you tips on how to get out.  Try the Grayrock method.  He will NOT like being grayrocked.. if you're not smart about it he might catch on to what you're doing. People with cluster B are very very clever. be prepared for retaliation.. Sometimes NPD can get desperate when their favorite form of supply is about to leave. You might have to go completely No Contact. look up tips for how to safely escape domestic abuse.. because while everything is fine right now, it might not be when he feels truly threatened.. It's a tricky situation, you might have to convince him that YOU are no good for HIM, and not the other way around, in order to get him to discard you so that you don't get hurt.  Be very very careful.

a bruised ego can trigger narcissistic rage, which is truly a frightening sight to behold. He may do things like stalk, blackmail, harass, send you gifts, steal, hack, leak nudes... he might even shittalk you to your friends and family.. there's all sorts of tricks a NPD might use to keep you in his clutches. My heart goes out to you. escaping a toxic cluster B is no joke.

&#x200B;

and to answer your question... he simply wants you for supply. Nothing more, nothing less. He could likely replace you very easily... He doesn't love you."

It's just been through a traumatic event, let your pup settle in!  No matter what the shelter says, it's up to you to gauge how they handle other people and other dogs.   A good rule of thumb to know if your dog is over its threshold is if its willing to take a treat from you.  If your dog is too nervous to take treats, then they're very uncomfortable and they'd rather not be in that situation. If your dog is that stressed, he's not going to be able to calm down and not going to be able to learn how to cope.  You petting him while he's afraid is not helping him calm down.  The only thing that will help him calm down is a big enough distraction from the scary thing.  At this moment you are unable to make a large enough distraction, so you must keep him away from his triggers.

He's outside of his socialization phase, so it is not important to socialize him right now.  Go very very slowly, and build his confidence before you try to take him to public places."

yesyesyesno,fb7no8h,t1_fb6vc9h,1576595033.0,hmmm... i see your point. i still would get to know a girl a little bit before even asking her on a date. if someone walked up to me and i didn't know them and they asked me on a date my stranger danger alarm bells would go off...
yesyesyesno,fb6j42s,t1_fb6hu85,1576551560.0,"ok give it a reasonable amount of time.. like 3 casual interactions before you ask her out. if she says ""no"" or ""maybe"" or ""i would, but"" then pull away. no need to ghost, just grayrock her."
yesyesyesno,fb6h2hw,t1_fb6dwtf,1576550110.0,"get to know a girl before asking her out. it comes off as creepy if the only thing you know about a girl is how pretty she is. make some idle talk and ask some questions to see where you stand with her. as long as you're not sexually suggestive, you're probably not going to have many problems. most women want to be in a relationship with a dude that makes them feel comfortable. i understand there are some scheming bitches out there, but in a just world, there's no reason a woman shouldn't give you a chance if you're both single and you're invested in knowing her. 

anyone who's going to overreact and reject you even after you've been polite and invested, is not worth pursuing and you should consider it a favor that she doesn't like you back."

spend an hour or two engaging with him each day. 

eventually he will get exhausted and will be much easier to control.

also don't let his play sessions with the other dog get out of control. break it up every few minutes or when they start getting too aggressive. just hold them back gently by hugging their chest and let them calm down and breathe for a minute. then let them go again. 

last but not least, you can avoid chewing on the harness if you only keep it on during walks; take it off when he's inside and don't let him out of your site if he's wearing it. if he starts to chew the harness, shove a toy in his mouth instead."
