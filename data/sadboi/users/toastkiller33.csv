Everyone has rent and bills. Children require a lot of groceries to feed. All of someones income pools together to cover all those things. And it's not illegal for parents to buy things for themselves as well as their children.  Of course, unless, there is evidence of neglect.

BPD,fndj67y,t3_g15a9p,1586871219.0,"I am here now. I'm so exhausted deep in my soul just with the bare minimum life requires. I keep trying to practice awareness and be better controlling myself, keeping my emotions inside and not putting them on others, but my internal storm of emotions is ever present. It never relents. I've stopped cutting and having active suicidal ideation the past 3 years, but what has replaced that feels like a dark void of numb and yet always present chronic pain. I just ignore the hurt and press on because I have no choice.  I'm always dissociating and finding it hard to focus on anything or see the point in having any sort of goal at all. I find myself struggling to keep in contact with my parents who are thousands of miles away, and I just want to hide. I want to run away. I want to live alone and only have myself to answer to. I just want peace. But I know even if somehow I could run, and support myself alone, I'd feel just as horrible and guilty and full of shame. It would just follow me, because it is me. 

At the moment, I'm trying to figure if it'd be a better practice to just work on accepting that this IS my life. My consciousness. This is just how it is for me. And maybe if that's true, then I really should be alone, and maybe that needs to be my goal. I'm tired of every close relationship I enter starting so nice and then ending up with me feeling like I'm only there to survive and doubting how I feel about everything. I'm not sure I can be intimate or truly love anyone anymore. I often think I'm fooling myself to think I'll ever be able to really open up to someone the way I need to."

But I do wish many of the customers knew just how much I also wish they didn't have to wait. I hate it too. I hate how the system is practically set up to make someone pissed off before they get to me and then I have to deal with it after talking to 50 other people just like them already. Realize that we are stressed too. We are humans, not robots on the end of the line for you to abuse.

I get so irritated. I put up with it a lot basically because I know my bf has different needs than me in this regard and I don't want him to think I always hate him touching me, and I also don't want him feeling like he's walking on eggshells.

BPD,fm2viha,t3_fspaux,1585706380.0,"I feel this in my core. It is one of the hardest parts about it isn't it? Letting go is so difficult. It's a huge process for me. Every time I get the urge to reach out again to someone who I know for a fact doesn't want to hear from me, it's extremely hard to resist. But I've come to realize how unhealthy it is. I still don't always succeed at stopping myself but I am trying more these days than ever before... Making myself stop feels like the opposite of what I should do. I'm still so weak sometimes. But it's the very thing I need to do. Begging for the attention of someone who wants no part of any bit of your life at all is not only degrading to ourselves, it violates their right to the boundary they've enforced between us. But I get it. Sometimes the more someone can't stand me the more I want to explain myself. As if that would change a thing about anything that happened between us. My desire to be understood and validated is stronger than my desire to stop myself from doing what I damn well know is not going to be appreciated, or actually fix anything. But I convince myself I'm entitled to say something. And I am really just not. Once someone makes their mind up about the kind of person you are, it's like trying to talk to a brick wall. It goes no where. 

I'm the one who needs to make my mind up about myself. If I do love and care for the people who's attention I crave the most, and those people unfortunately loathe me now because of my own shit, it's high time to let them go. They want to be gone. And sometimes people just don't owe us the closure or understanding we think we deserve as much as it feels like death to hear that.  We can only try to learn to give ourselves the understanding others can't or won't give.

My ex husband broke through the lock on the bathroom door and forced himself and our daughter into the room while I had my upper arm and thighs all bloodied up from razors. I suppose he thought by forcing her in there I guess it would shame me to stop. I stopped in that moment, of course, but my emotional pain that made me want to cut in the first place increased 100 fold.  It didn't make me want to hurt myself less.  It did make me want to attack him though for bringing my kid into the middle of it. I felt blind rage for him in that moment, and my heart broke all at once. It made me positive he didn't love me or care even a tiny amount how I actually felt about anything. You know what ACTUALLY helps someone doing this? If you're a person in their life who supposedly loves them, LISTEN to how they feel, without judgement.  Let them talk about how they feel without shaming them for it.

BPD,fik7sqb,t3_f8auvo,1582474737.0,"I think it was from the very beginning. My parents adopted me through a youth outreach program within their church at the time. I've always known I was adopted, and never really felt like I fit in with my overly Christian family. My biological mother was a 16 year old girl who already had and lost a child to the government. She had a horrible home life and got into a bad situation early on. She was a bipolar cocaine addict. My biological father was a horrible man based on the little I know. He was older, likely groomed her and maybe even raped her. When I was a teen I discovered through my adoptive mother after much pushing for information, that he had been in prison for the rape of his own daughters. I honestly regret asking. I am now aware I was likely a product of rape from a detestable predator and I was very close to being aborted. I wish I didn't know. I don't really think knowing that has helped me in any way.  I was the only girl she ended up having, the 2nd born out of a total of 5 children, all of which she had to give up. I was a lucky one. I got adopted before birth, so right after I was born I went straight to my adoptive parents.  

They were good parents as far as I know, or tried to be. They have their own issues from their own upbringing and pasts but that would turn this into a novel. But I will mention that they did not believe in therapy. I never went despite wanting to for years as a teen. I always dreamt of getting away from them because I never felt like I was the kid they hoped I would be, and I felt like they ignored some very important needs of mine. I was raised an only child, isolated in rural areas most my life.  I got to experience a lot of totally normal things a lot of kids do. I went to church camp. I went to youth group. I had fun. Sometimes I didn't. I eventually became non religious which strained my living situation with my parents a lot. 

I always had issues as a child. I think I was abused by one or more of my sitters but I may have blacked it out. I remember flashes of memories as a small child, inappropriate memories but so incomplete I can't be sure if it's real. But it would explain a lot if it was true. I've always had issues with attachment in my relationships. I was a very jealous friend. I felt that a friend wasn't my real best friend if they spent more time with someone else.  

To this day I am all SUCH a mess haha. To talk about it all would take a book. Or maybe even a series.

BPD,fhrfcfq,t3_f43bjp,1581824786.0,"Absolutely yes. Been feeling like my health is out of control lately. All the years of depressed neglect is catching up. I'd give anything to be able to take proper care of my teeth again from the beginning. If you can't force yourself to shower... make the one thing you try to force yourself to do be brushing your teeth. My teeth are horrible now, and beginning to cause a lot of expensive issues.  I wish I could knock sense into my younger self. Although I doubt I would have listened to myself. 

But I know the struggle. For me I just have an issue seeing the point in giving a shit about myself because I can't figure out how not to hate myself. I figure any misery I inflict on myself is deserved anyway. But I have 2 kids and people in my life who are going to be affected standing by watching me suffer due to my own crap. It makes me hate myself more and wish I could run away and be a hermit in the wilderness with no ties to anyone or anything.  Like why can't I just do the bare minimum anyone does without it being such a struggle mentally. Why is it so hard? 

I seriously feel sometimes like I've created a life for myself now where I will always be hiding how I really feel about everything and be too cowardly to be truly honest with anyone close to me. All I know is the bare minimum for survival. And they deserve more. And I'm so tired and feel like such a failure in every way. 

TL;DR, I relate a ton! Finding the will to care about yourself is exhausting."

I would not blame someone for being hesitant to trust knowing it happened in the past in another relationship.

BPD,fgpnwdm,t1_fgonuty,1581008568.0,"My ex husband told me the way I would bawl and sob when I had a really big emotional episode was as if my Mom or someone close to me had died.  He told me he didn't believe I was actually that upset and was acting that way on purpose to manipulate him. When I tried to explain that I actually do feel that horrible in those moments and it was not an intentional act of manipulation he laughed at me. 

I haven't had an episode like that in ages since I haven't been living with him. No one triggered me like he did. He made me feel like I was just imagining it all and was just crazy...and that dynamic brought out that absolute most crazy version of myself I've ever seen..."

When you're too depressed to give a shit about yourself and are absolutely convinced you don't deserve happiness, especially considering your track record....it's a waiting game until you die. I'll survive. And then I'll die, and maybe know some peace for once. I've been miserable as long as I can remember, I just don't see it ever changing. And I don't care if it does anymore."

BPD,fflyebf,t3_etx3zd,1580045719.0,"I feel like this every single day. I'm 35. My illness cost me my marriage, my everything. I left my home country and integrated  where I am currently in Canada. I haven't seen my parents in years and have no family of my own here other than my children. Since my kids are staying in Canada,my options after my relationship blew up were to go back to the states and abandon my kids so I could have a healthy support network, or stay isolated and live with a generous local friend for a while. But it drug me into alcoholism and extremely questionable BS in the lowest time of my life. Kept me from living in my car though. My kids still adore me, and they keep me pushing myself onward. But I'll be honest. It feels like a cage sometimes. One I put myself in. Like I am doomed to a lifetime of enduring suffering, because I just can't take the easy way now. I couldn't bear being responsible for more of their suffering. They suffered through their father and mines terrible relationship already. They had to get used to life after mom got taken out of the home by the police and only seeing me a day or two a week now. Singlehandedly most traumatic thing I've ever endured due to being out of control of my feelings and reactions and absolutely going insane from the isolation coming here and having kids brought on me. 

I'm just accepting the fact now that life for me will forever be riddled with regret and intense guilt and self loathing.  I should've been able to be a better mother. A better wife. But I'm me instead. A royal fuck up.  I'm scared of the day my kids become old enough to understand exactly why everything went wrong. I hope they won't hate me.

Things are better now. I have a boyfriend. He cares a lot about me and it's the least volatile relationship I've ever had. I'm terrified it's a matter of time before I fuck this up too.

Sorry, that was a novel. There is so much shame around it all, I don't talk much about it. But it's real."

I don't judge anyone for a mistake like cheating they make when enduring a situation that is causing them to live in literal misery. No one is in their right mind living in misery. Not everyone has friends and family who are near or even exist to help them get out. Some people have kids and an entire life and finances intermingled that make things extremely complicated.  This is one of those topics, on Reddit in particular, you're right. If you cheated you're the dirtbag. Oh well I get to look at myself in the mirror every day and feel the weight of my choices and their consequences in every facet of my life. Not those who judge who have ever been where I have. They don't have to feel what I feel every day. So they can think I am scum if they like. Survival is all there is anymore.

It's horrible and people want to lessen their guilt by blaming someone or something else, but only we are responsible for our own actions. The thing I can't accept though is the people who say if you cheat you didn't love them. I still love him now. I will regret the things I did for the rest of my life. I believe you can love someone you cheat on. Our emotions and impulses fuck us up in horrible ways and my mistakes are just that. Mistakes.

It's a very hurtful thing to have happen to you, and it's an immensely shameful thing to do to someone else. If you have any sort of heart and soul, looking at yourself in the mirror afterwards when you realize what you're actually capable of is punishment enough. You'll never see yourself the same. That being said, I refer to my first sentence. There's probably half of the planet that has done it. Emotional cowardice is commonplace. Not everyone deals with their issues in the perfect way or makes the best decisions they should in the moment when emotionally vulnerable and suffering. If cheaters are irredeemable, that's like saying anyone who has cheated may as well jump off a cliff because they're now trash to society and will never have or deserve real love. That's a lot of people. If that's how someone honestly feels, calm down Hitler. You're worse than the cheaters."

And often only one person gets painted as the bad guy when it ends, even when both are responsible for the misery."
