Also, this is probably very specific to my own taste, but I no longer buy prints. I still use printed pieces that I own, but from hereon out, it's solids for me. I just get more versatility that way.

I forgot, I do have two more rules for myself:

1. Buy only cotton or linen, unless it's sportswear. I live in the tropics and synthetics make me stink! And they are better for the earth in the long run (maybe not as much for cotton, but at least no microfibers getting into our waterways).

2. When I buy shorts now, I think on whether I can wear them as comfortable house clothes/pajamas (I don't wear regular pajamas, it is just too hot here, even with the ac on) when they don't look nice enough to wear outside anymore."

For me, what clicked was realizing that it was absolutely messed up that I was hiding packages from my husband. When I got home, I would race from the car to stash bags in cabinets then open them when he was out or asleep.

If you can afford a therapist, maybe try to find out if you have any underlying reasons for shopping? Around a year ago, I found out that I had ADHD, so there lies the explanation for my impulsive behavior. Identifying that has been half the battle for me and has helped me be more aware of the feelings I get that trigger me. And I say trigger because that's what happens! So I avoid both stores and social media. My ADHD makes me focus on what's immediately in front of me, so knowing this I try hard to avoid browsing. Out of sight, out of mind.

When I feel the temptation to shop for clothes, I work out instead. I think to myself that I won't look better in that new thing, but working out will make my old clothes look better and make me healthier.
