cursedcomments,fhx120b,t1_fhwzx3l,1581940367.0,"Yes and no. Quite literally infants born with this disorder are missing all / most of the part of the brain that we call our brain. This baby's only functions are likely his heart beating and other basics. 

Anencephaly (which is the condition) babies are also missing a portion of their skull. Typically born stillborn (75% or cases), or dying shortly after birth (hours to a few weeks). These individuals have trouble even maintaining consciousness.

In 2016 there was a [report of a baby](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5093842/) who lived to 28 months withthus condition without life sustaining treatment. She was also on DNR per her family's request. She had seizures starting at 3 months, which worsened later. No organs of hers were able to be donated upon death.

We can see [here](https://www.medicinenet.com/anencephaly/article.htm#anencephaly_facts) that this disorder occurs within the first weeks of pregnancy, and usually results in a miscarriage. Those who make it to term - and aren't stillborn - are missing areas of the brain required for: thinking, hearing, vision, emotion, and coordinating movement. 

If we consult trusty [Wikipedia ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anencephaly#Organ_donation) we learn that due to having the brain stem these babies also have ""brain stem reflexes,"" and thusly are not brain dead. 

So, TL;DR, no, they not brain dead, but they're also not necessarily alive in the sense of being able to be their own person. Ever."

I also understand that I will never see many of these people again, and, if them misgendering me hurts bad enough I have my friends and family who know I'm a guy.

I hate to say it, but too much of trans twitter acts like snowflakes. Reality is rough. I struggle with OCD and depression, and with my current situation the app NOCD is the best I can do to manage things. (I'm unable to work due to mental/physical health, but was unable to get on disability because there was one job they found that I MIGHT be able to do.)

(Reddit doesn't seem to be nearly as bad as twitter, and I purposely follow a couple idiots on Facebook as a bizarre ""you could be THIS level of dumb"" kind of self assurance...) But these things remind me that I'm quite a bit more mature than my anxiety wants me to think.

I kind of went on an almost nonsensical tangent, oops.

She continued her tantrum regardless, and he was reasonably afraid. So, for being able to look at things like an adult I'm apparently transphobic according to like half of trans twitter lol"
mildlyinfuriating,fhp2al1,t3_f497zr,1581780482.0,"Half of trans twitter understands how slang and such works. The other half is overly sensitive and will call for mass reporting / blocking because of the dumbest shit. 

Source: I'm trans but was deemed transphobic for having enough rational sense to immediately realize that that trans woman's freakout in GameStop about a year or so ago was NOT okay."

This look into how Kanji, Naoto, and Yosuke were simply used as gimmicks and not given proper treatment, which trivializes LGBT and insinuates you can be ""cured.""

The most telling is, of course, how Naoto was always meant to be a guy, but they dropped it. They left in everything to make Naoto out to be trans, and then they drop the ball. Naoto ""accepts"" that they're a woman."
