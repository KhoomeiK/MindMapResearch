I promise you her performances are much better :) Check out her iTunes shows! She‚Äôs an excellent singer. I‚Äôve seen her live three times. She sounds exactly like studio however on recordings she sounds broken. I believe it may have to do with sound design of venues plus recording equipment (phones, etc) followed by upload quality (YouTube and Facebook can be awful).

GERD,f9318hh,t3_e3bcsa,1575047277.0,"I‚Äôve been in your shoes, it‚Äôs *awful*! I know this will be more difficult but consider your food options in addition to the Low FODMAP diet. It‚Äôs a diet entirely structured for gas. It seeks out food with certain factors that will lessen your symptoms.

I would lay low on the dairy if you‚Äôre intolerant. Remember, gas happens because of certain fermentations. Certain foods don‚Äôt break down as well as others, especially for those who are intolerant. Therefore, bloating happens because of too much gas. :( And if something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù stays for too long, your body will have no choice to let it out‚Äîthat‚Äôs why I throw up pizza. :(

I recommend you have more fibrous foods (oatmeal, prunes, figs, etc). It will keep your digestive system moving food/acid properly and you‚Äôll have the probability to do #2 more when gas actually does come :) Start slow with fiber! Psyllium fiber supplements (because brands are too damn expensive) also help push contents in your stomach. I take it everyday. *Definitely research this.*

ASK YOUR DOCTOR FOR ORAL-DISINTEGRATING NAUSEA PILLS OR BUY ZOFRAN. Major help! If you throw up often, definitely ask your doctor if you can have that first. Make sure it‚Äôs oral-disintegrating. Regular anti-nausea drugs won‚Äôt help you if you just throw it back out. Feel better!"

The shoe shape is produced differently than their traditional 1460 boots which is why they recommend you size down once (you can check the DM website, this is officially recognized as their sizing suggestion for Jadon‚Äôs), not necessarily because the leather stretches to your actual size. If you compare each boot from the bottom, you‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm talking about.

I‚Äôm a women‚Äôs US6/UK4 in 1460‚Äôs and women‚Äôs US5/UK3 in Jadon‚Äôs. They fit perfectly fine and if they are a little tight at first, break them in.

GERD,f8zg66k,t3_e2xf9k,1574960465.0,"Stress and eating like crap for me, honestly. I *always* eat organic and unprocessed (plus try to have a balanced diet), however everything I loved eating were GERD-triggering foods (onion & garlic in my everyday cooking, oranges, apples, veggie tacos, yogurt, pizza, pasta dishes, chocolate, coffee, deep-fried stuff, etc).

Before my diagnosis, I always believed tomatoes, onion, garlic, and other fruits/vegetables are healthy. They are, however not for us... I began with lactose intolerance cramps (when I didn‚Äôt have them before) and stomach pain to full-blown indigestion, bloating, vomiting, stool complications, hard swallowing, globus, water brashing, daily nausea, etc.

My gastroenterologist believes coupled with my regular diet pre-diagnosis, stress is probably my biggest problem. Hoping to go to therapy and maybe my stomach acid will relax that I can enjoy yogurt and coffee again in the morning, plus brownies/chocolate chip cookies as a dessert later."

GERD,f8vp7ui,t3_e2c9zb,1574874484.0,"I stay away from dairy, so don‚Äôt expect to read yogurt.

Breakfast: scrambled eggs with a carb (bread, rice). Instant oatmeal with a dairy-alternative (almond milk instead of water/cow‚Äôs milk is BOMB‚Äîtry it, and I hate dairy alternatives lol). Cereal (only the stuff they sell at Whole Foods, not that processed crap you find at Wal-Mart or CVS, those are AWFUL for you stomach) with oatmilk. Clif bars!

Lunch: When I feel daring enough to have a ‚Äúbig meal.‚Äù Plain grilled chicken with rice (yellow, white, or brown) and chopped lettuce topped with curry mustard sauce (make your own or obtain one without onion + garlic). Same for beef, but very thin slices. Half of a veggie burger with plenty of lettuce and vegan cheese. Plenty of leftovers for tomorrow.

Snacks: Whole wheat Ritz crackers/water crackers/unsalted crackers with nut butters (almond is alkaline and tastes excellent‚Äîbe careful which nuts you choose, some cause GERD symptoms). Oatmeal cookies (at a pace). Bananas. Prunes. Figs. Bread.

Dinner: I don‚Äôt even fuck with the odds I might get sick, so I literally just eat a couple slices of bread. Fat-free carbs are best for dinner; baked potato with a fork. Fruit may take long to digest, up to you. Chow down with a movie/couple episodes. Wait for the three hours to go by until I can go to sleep."

Dizziness was rare for me, same for heart palpitations. I find that the heart palpitations happened when I was highly stressed and my acid was acting up often. Honestly, my solution was just to do breathing exercises and eat super plain food. Dizziness‚Äîbreathing exercises + sitting upward and having naturally caffeine-free tea (I like chamomile). My purse has tea bags in a ziplock just in case.

Today, I‚Äôm still dealing with GERD until it goes away (temporarily üôÑüôÑüôÑ). I have no H. Pylori infection to worry about anymore, however acid reflux is staying for a while. I still find that I‚Äôm eating slices of bread for dinner out of sheer terror I might feel nauseous or bad again. It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs certainly helping out the acid. 

Happy Thanksgiving! I hope you get the chance to cheat on something tasty for a bite or two!"
GERD,f8oa1hl,t1_f8gdax4,1574669605.0,"I haven‚Äôt yet! I should, but it sounds like our stories are very similar. I genuinely believe that my digestive screw-ups are largely contributed to stress (growing up on my own [at what age do you really stop growing up? lol], eventually doing everything on my own, managing two jobs and finishing my degree [telling myself it‚Äôs never too late!]). I‚Äôm actually seeking psychiatric and therapeutic help and as sessions progress, I‚Äôve noticed my stomach behaves better.

As a female, LOL. I haven‚Äôt had the blessing to have children yet, however it‚Äôs certainly not easy! I don‚Äôt know how they do it either! I can‚Äôt even handle nausea for the 30-60 minutes I experience it followed by loss of appetite. You mean to tell me as a woman, after all that, *it is completely possible to regain hope in food without thinking it might actually kill me*? Lmao. A wild mix of cravings and random bouts of sickness?! I would be mentally crashing every other day. I‚Äôm already doing it a couple times a week with the acid reflux!

What I have found helpful with nausea (naturally, of course):
‚Ä¢ Sea Bands. You can buy them at CVS, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, etc. It‚Äôs those bands motion sickness-sensitive people and chemo patients use when nausea kicks in. I‚Äôve had a couple people I know use them for a cruise and they didn‚Äôt throw up at all. Personally, I‚Äôm all too terrified of the idea of it, so I use it in conjunction with anti-nausea drugs/supplements and it‚Äôs calmed me down the same way Tums gives me minor relief.  Some days, when I‚Äôm feeling brave without the anti-nausea drugs/supplements, I‚Äôll use them before bed and I‚Äôll sleep throughout the whole night without discomfort! :) Which brings me to the second one:
‚Ä¢ Ginger pills. You can find them under the nausea section of your local drug store‚Äôs antacid aisle. I buy Dramamine Naturals, which is just a ginger supplement‚Äîno drugs. I personally like to stay away from drugs as much as I can. If you‚Äôd like to test the waters for ginger, try a naturally caffeine-free ginger tea. Now, I despise ginger, however I‚Äôve grown to love it since it makes me feel better.

Not to scare you, but should you experience severe nausea/vomiting with your antibiotics (unlikely, but everybody‚Äôs different), talk with your doctor about an oral-dissolving anti-nausea pill (if they approve for your condition). That way, if you do end up experiencing severe nausea/vomiting, the drug remains in your system versus you just throwing it back up.

PLEASE take the invitation to talk about how stressful you‚Äôre feeling. I‚Äôm confident you‚Äôll get better!

GERD,f8abcrn,t3_dzpy1l,1574392636.0,"Hi, some friendly advice! I'm not sure if you are lactose intolerant/allergic to milk, but during my treatment (and post-treatment) of antibiotics for my H. pylori infection, my gastro recommended I ate foods that replenished good bacteria + coated my stomach + fibrous foods that kept things moving. It'll help your stomach heal. I was eating yogurt with granola/oatmeal with almond milk for breakfast and then figs/prunes & bananas as a mid-day snack for a long time and it seemed to really help versus the days I didn't.

My stomach was painfully sensitive then and those small things were a growing improvement with all the diet and lifestyle complications. Passing this along, hoping that it may help you. :) There's dairy alternatives to yogurt now if you can't have dairy, but be careful of which nuts can trigger GERD-related symptoms. Almond and oatmilk is BOMB as a substitute for water/milk in oatmeal, in fact I prefer them :)
