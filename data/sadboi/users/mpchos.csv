The distribution of sched between core and majors is pretty even, especially with the new curriculum. Depending on the prof, core subjects aren't hassle with requirements. I'm not sure with the curriculum now, but core subjects were from first to fourth year. Now I think it's just during the first two years.

I'd like to think that yeah, teachers in Ateneo are more involved compared to DLSU. Socratic method just is the teacher talks in front and asks students questions (recitations). In Ateneo, consultations are pretty popular as well as using different teaching methods aside from just talking in front and asking questions. There are presentations, group activities, creative work, etc. At the end, some profs become your friends and mentors! They genuinely care about you. For instance, my English prof once had a ""mental health check"" wherein he opened sign-ups for a consultation for you to talk about how well you're taking things + once during midterms for us to chill he made us watch Rent the musical during class time. Some profs really teach you how to become good people and not just obedient students. :)"

ADMU,ffvsyke,t3_euu7if,1580272355.0,"I think you should ask a broader audience for this haha but a factor you should consider in deciding what university you should go to is whether you're going to pursue further studies, I guess. In terms of specialization, DLSU has that advantage 'cause Ateneo has more core subjects than DLSU. Ateneo's obviously more holistic, which is also an advantage because no other university forms you not just academically both academically and personally like Ateneo but again it depends on perspective.

* **Student life:** LS sometimes reminds me of those US high school TV shows HAHAH like Teen Wolf, Sex Education, and The Politician for some reason. Acads are more or less intense, especially core. Orgs are also important. Schedules can be hectic because where your classes can be held (eg CTC-BEL). Ateneo drained 10 years of my life, while seeing my friends in DLSU, they seemed to have so much time on their hands haha.
* **Dorming:** DLSU has lots of condos around Taft, unlike Katipunan where there are (I THINK) more dorms than condos. My average rent was 6k/month. My friends from Taft shared an SMDC condo, which is I guess around 15k/month split to two. But tbh, it's more worth staying in Katipunan not just 'cause of variety but also because of safety. Taft is Taft haha it's kinda hard to get around it without your own car.

TBH if you personify Ateneo and DLSU, it's like Ateneo's that empathetic introvert and DLSU's that adventurous extrovert hahaha.

**tl;dr: I am biased so I say Ateneo's better. But you also have to think of whether or not you'll want to specialize in your field or be holistically formed. Ateneo will drain you but it's fulfilling.  Katipunan is safer than Taft for sure.**"
ADMU,ffr9hol,t3_et5q3m,1580153369.0,"I'd say yes, orgs are worth it. In the one hand, employers now look for how well you work within a group or a team vs. your academic standing, so co-curricular activities go a long way. On the other hand, orgs are where you can find long-lasting friends, way beyond your block/course! I mean, there's no harm in trying but if it's not your cup of tea, then being org-less is also fine."

ADMU,ffr8b6u,t3_eulmvi,1580152637.0,"Hey there, BS CTM graduate here.

* **What you should know about the program**: It's basically integrated marketing communications haha. It has subjects of general management, but ""specialize"" in marketing, communications, or IT. Quotation marks on specialize because you don't really specialize in anything, but you do take more subjects over the other two. Other people ask what ComTech really is, and I just say marketing haha because tbh that's what it is in a nutshell. It's like... ***management, but make it artsy.***
* **Reputation**: ComTech graduates usually have the rep of going into FMCGs, advertising, and/or media companies. This is because the course is mostly oriented towards brand management and creative communications. I have batchmates who work in Unilever, Viva Films, and Klook. Some work as creative managers while others work as management trainees.
* **Subjects**: [Here](https://www.ateneo.edu/sites/default/files/downloadable-files/BS%20CTM%20Curriculum%20ver%202018.pdf) is the 2018 version of the curriculum. Key subjects (that I can relate to 'cause I came from the old curriculum) are the COM subjects and the MGT subjects like operations and strategic management. Seeing the curriculum, ComTech is super into communications and less into the IT (in the old curric, IT focused on hardware and software). Now, it's more integrative meaning it's more of answering, ""how can we use technology to communicate the brand to others?"" In the COM subjects you'll learn theory (e.g. semiotics) and practicalities (e.g. production, Photoshop). The MGT subjects are generally management practices. How to analyze and improve companies, essentially hahaha. They're fun tbh!
* **Student Culture**: This is really subjective, but people are really nice! It's mixed, but since it's ComTech, there will obviously be a number of outgoing personalities. I know a lot of coursemates (and SOM in general) who came from private high schools. I'm an introvert so I didn't really go out with a lot of coursemates, but I did go out with my blockmates. Cherish your blockmates hehe.
* **General advice:** Make sure you really want to take this, because sometimes you'll feel that this is such a ""jack of all trades"" course. **Find your passion and purpose and use the skills you will have learned in ComTech to fuel them.** Do not limit yourself to your course either. Take a minor, join not just the home org. You can literally go anywhere (industry, etc.) after you graduate (I know someone who took CTM and went to med school). Also, enjoy your core subjects. They'll really help you with majors in unexpected ways.

You're in really good hands, imo. CONGRATS IN GETTING IN!!! <3"

AskReddit,f5shfk0,t1_f5sfulu,1572430592.0,I also love If I Fell and Norwegian Wood! I've only listened to their studio version so thank you for the suggestion :o
suggestmeabook,f5sfzpl,t3_dp4bn2,1572428403.0,"This suggestion is in general since I'm counting on 2G data, but I enjoyed Natsume Soseki's books! And of course, the famous Murakami. They may be fiction but it does give Japan historical context. Literature great to read are poems (perhaps an anthology) as well since I get the impression that Japanese love to make them. I also have yet to read more books on JPN Lit but those authors made me fall in love with Japan in general!"

BPD,f5s009d,t3_doy3e8,1572407336.0,"I feel the same way! Except I get even more paranoid when he talks to other girls when one of us is busy. Then I have to ask what he was doing. Then he'll answer and defend his answer (eg he was with a girl because work things).

He also loves museum dates and when he'd tell me he's been to this museum, he had to add ""by myself"" to make sure I'm not paranoid. The trust issues are draining me but I can't help but do it to myself :(

(Also sorry for my own personal rant; I just really wanted to say how much I feel you at your struggle, so you're not alone huhu)"
BPD,f5q03if,t3_dokywu,1572370550.0,MY NUMBER ONE FEAR I cannot exaggerate this enough! This is also why I'm so afraid of commitment and why I push the people I'm interested in away. :(
AmItheAsshole,f5g3oat,t3_dnuh60,1572189376.0,NTA. Reminds me of those HIMYM episodes where Ted would bring a new girl to intimate friend bonding times. But yeah it's your party and your birthday! It's insensitive of L to just bring whomever they want tbh
Showerthoughts,f5fw3i0,t1_f5fj5vi,1572187337.0,"Yeah I get what you mean and you really have a good point on the metal straws, but it still contributes to the damage. I read a journal somewhere that a metal straw has a significantly higher damaging impact than plastic, but the least impact is bamboo. I suppose it still goes to the way businesses make themselves sustainable in a sense that they're able to replenish their supply/resources in making their products as much as people want to buy it.

Don't get me wrong, I agree that so many things are made and that costs the loss of many other things. Maybe the real enemy is capitalism jk½"
Georgia,f5f0rr7,t1_f5d8wr6,1572177048.0,Thanks for the info! I definitely have heard of Manila Mart but Kuya' food Express sounds so cool! For now I guess I'll just have to walk around to know my way through Gainesville. I heard there's also a train...? I hear it all the time at home hahahha
offmychest,f5f01wg,t1_f5dbtd1,1572176878.0,"Same here! Not to mention when no one remembers, it's okay. Then when someone posts about it on my wall, now everyone is messaging me. Idk it just doesn't feel genuine to me"
