It really helps to talk about what you're going through with the people who matter, they can give you reassurance that they do want you around and they do love you. It gives you space to loosen up and be yourself.

Now a lot of things from back when still echo here and there but have lost their strength. 

You have to push youself to stay who you are even when you feel judged and unloved. Cause you know damn well it's a projection of your mind and not how people really feel about you. Open youself up a little and you'll see that you are loved.

You can choose to replace these patterns. Your mind can't be empty of imagination, but instead of using your creative imagination to harm youself and strengthen a negative self image, every time you catch youself think like this flip it on it's head with the opposite positive daydream. And as strongly as you believed the negative, shift that belief to the positive. We all have a judge and a victim in our mind, shut them the hell up and listen to your own true self cause it's there and it's stronger than all the bullshit.

Also, you should check out these books: 
The power of now, The four agreements, The monk who sold his ferrari.

Try birnual beats, yoga, meditation, breathing excersizes, long walks, fasting, cold showers, journaling, replacing harmful habits with good ones.

You can listen to Eckart Tolle, Alan Watts, Shadguru.. etc.
