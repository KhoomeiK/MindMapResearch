But, I understand, I think, what you're saying here, even if I'm not very familiar with the source material. 

One of the great things about this is how you mix the sacred with the profane, throwing in words like ""filth"" and ""shit"" into the poem. That seems to fit with your theme, which has to do with the perversion of something which should have been loving.

The line ""Of how she imprisoned the devil inside of her story"" is fantastic. I love it.

The rhyme scheme too is interesting. There are a few lines which don't rhyme. This makes them stand out, like:
