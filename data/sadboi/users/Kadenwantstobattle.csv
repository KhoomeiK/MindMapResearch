mentalhealth,f824s0k,t1_f8242pm,1574183969.0,"No, you correlated this to religion when you gave sources clearly biased on religion. Again a skin deep look at Dr Peterson reveals his psychological focus is on religion and spirituality.
Yes, YOU said it was more than a piece of paper. I never agreed and I won’t ever.
There is commitment in vows, yes. But again remember this isn’t about said commitments. You explicitly stated in your original comment that you view sex as just a way to get “STDs, children out of wedlock, your feelings played with”. My retaliation was pointing out not only were these avoidable, but that sex has benefits such as relieving stress. Marriage doesn’t factor anywhere into that. YOU brought up marriage. YOU brought morals into it, because marriage can be viewed subjectively. I believe it’s completely unfair to bring it up in a conversation that was just about sex, and holding it as the standard as if you’re a bad person for having sex while unmarried when situations like rape exist and ESPECIALLY when certain minorities have been denied the right to marry for ages and still are denied that right."
mentalhealth,f8233hm,t1_f8224ph,1574182941.0,"You’re joking? You have to be. There’s no way.
Well first of all, not everybody wants to get married. Second of all, not everybody can get married. Third of all you never needed to be married to do the horizontal tango before it was dictated that you needed to be married because of stupid religious laws not everybody wants to follow. If I wanna fuck, I can do so with whoever I want (and who consents).
Furthermore even skin deep research on Dr Peterson reveals that he is coming from a stance of religion. He has a special focus in the psychology of religion and it can be assumed he himself is very likely also religious, especially considering the area he’s from. I’m also from said area, I know what it’s like here.
Religion isn’t bad and he’s still credible but he’s biased. Unless you can give me a single reason unrelated to religion and apparently your idea that sex can’t be safe unless it’s with a spouse, and the idea that fucking can only be done when your relationship is recognized with a stupid piece of paper several million people were denied on the basis their relationship wasn’t good enough, then I will stand my ground. There’s been studies on the benefits of sex and masturbation both physically and mentally, and marriage has absolutely nothing to do with that."
mentalhealth,f820dhx,t1_f81zv21,1574181293.0,"You want an answer? To a question that really doesn’t apply to most people?
Like I already told you, if you have unprotected sex, emotional attachment issues or your partner is an ass sure you have to worry about kids or stds or your feelings getting played but if you’re responsible like every rational adult there’s no need to be that worried. Literally just use protection and choose your sex life based on your own emotional capacity.
So to answer? Yes I would like a libido and to have a sex life, because not having one also makes me depressed since it’s a way to relieve stress and build a close relationship with your partner and feel wanted. No, I don’t think anybody wants an std, but again there’s ways to protect yourself against such issues. Use them."

mentalhealth,f81yg36,t1_f81xdxk,1574180103.0,"You’re misunderstanding what is good about sex though. Sex and masturbation both relieve stress at a much higher and faster level than most other things, so much so you can immediately feel the stress relief. It can also help sleeping problems, and releases a rush of endorphins. Sex is absolutely good for you. The problems you’ve listed come with unprotected sex, and choosing an asshole of a partner or putting too much stock into a one night stand.
Then again not really surprised you’re unaware of how much stress and tension sex can relieve since you sound like you’ve never touched another human being in your life."

AskReddit,f0lbo4m,t3_d5bek2,1568708990.0,"Well it comes and it goes. Sometimes I'll want nothing more than to end it all and sometimes I love life so much I'll wonder why I ever wanted to die.

But honestly? My mom. My mom got really sick and diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder (ANCA positive vasculitis for those interested.) and she got worse very fast. She was in the hospital for 4 months of the year in total when I was in grade 9 (Canadian school system).

I stopped doing anything other than sleeping and going to see her. Keeping her company was my only goal. I just wanted her to be happy. For a while I even stopped eating regularly, I developed an eating disorder to regain control over my life, I was a mess. But somehow it was the turning point for me.

I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't commit suicide until after my mom died. I didn't think she'd last until I turned 19, so I vowed that as long as I served a purpose for her I'd keep going because I knew my brother wouldn't be able to care for her, my step dad cheated multiple times and he could barely visit her for longer than ten minutes at a time. I was all she had, so I just went through the paces.

At the time there was really only a few treatments, most of which she'd been put on with little success. She went through chemotherapy in low doses, steroids, and symptom management. Now she's on some new treatment that really helps her, I don't know the name but it's derived from hamster DNA. But back then it looked like she might die. We even made plans for me if she did, preparing for it just in case, so I figured I wouldn't wait long. But then she pulled through. Things got better at school and as unhealthy as it is I keep myself going by reminding myself how many people I need to help and aid. In the end the only reason I'm not anymore is because suddenly I was needed and I didn't want to let everyone down, so as long as people need me I'm here to stay."

My problem is when trans people are outcast from their own community and denied support and validation from people who are supposed to understand on some level what it's like because they're not masculine or feminine enough for some assholes standards.

It becomes especially terrible when you take into account that some of these people have HUGE followings within the community, and a lot of them tend to attack or bad-talk the people that Kalvin and other similar trans people with large followings talk about in videos/posts/etc, that's my point.
