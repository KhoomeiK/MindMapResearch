itsafetish,fr4xlq8,t1_fr4tpcs,1589898795.0,"That streamer said they think most gamers in general are white supremacists, so they basically insulted the entirety of the Twitch fanbase for no damn reason. I get it that some gamers are dicks and *especially* misogynists, but why would they think it’s a good idea to insult the entire platform that they’re supposed to be “moderating” in a completely ridiculous way? I go on Twitch once in awhile and of course this person decides to ignore the ongoing misogyny within the gaming community despite being a “woman” and instead just ends up appearing unhinged. At least there is one woman on the council and I truly hope she can be the one to address the sexism on that platform, because it’s not going to be Steph.

It says so much about Twitch that they let this person stay on the council even after their shitty behavior. They’re obviously not mature enough to be in such a position but they have to keep them because of iNcLuSiViTy. Because you know as soon as Twitch decides to can them it’ll be a whole scandal involving “transphobia” and not the fact that they’re unfit to moderate a community."

You can even still have full glam, without it looking cake-y or mask like in real life. It is true, some types of full glam really don’t look ideal in real life and are meant for being in front of a camera. Especially looks or techniques that come from beauty gurus such as baking or thick layers of foundation and multiple layers of bronzer and contour. 

I definitely do not agree with people that judge or look down on others for their makeup, though. I couldn’t care less what other people do. There’s a difference between sharing trends/techniques or having an opinion on different looks, and downright judging people or being preachy.

Overall, I like the trend of using less makeup. It’s a breath of fresh air compared to the posts on IG that popularize putting full drops of product directly on your face, thick layers of foundation and huge triangles of concealer all over. For me personally, it’s a waste of product and may even trick new makeup lovers into using up more makeup when the same , or even better effect can be achieved in light layers and more strategic application. 

So for me it’s more of an issue of makeup theory and technique. But I have been watching a lot of Lisa Eldridge and Robert Welsh so they have definitely influenced the way I look at makeup now!

ETA: also full glam means different things to different people!"

GenderCritical,fpjqgln,t3_gdrell,1588677915.0,"I think the sexism stems from the fact that there is a very real subset of the population that are entitled assholes, but only women are being called out on it. It’s definitely sexist and it’s becoming more and more common for “Karen” to be used towards any woman asserting herself, primarily online. In real life, I’ve actually never heard it been used much and I even worked fast food for five years. We had entitled people of both genders and it definitely was not exclusive to women. The fact that there is no agreed upon term for men, and that “Karen” has become such a common term in our vernacular is what makes it sexist to me. But I’m curious, has everyone’s experiences with this word been in person or online? I want to know how commonly it is being used in real life. Online it is surely rampant.
