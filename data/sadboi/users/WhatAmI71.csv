Of course, I actually have a medical excuse for not wearing one if I don't wish to wear one--I have an inhaler for asthma (diagnosed by a doctor and prescribed), which qualifies as a breathing problem, which at least here is a valid reason for foregoing the mask.

I am glad to hear you are exercising, and trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. It is hard to not focus on your weight when the whole world says that if you are chunky then you're undesirable, ugly, etc. Glad to know that there have been movements to change that, but still...it is indoctrinated in us as (especially) female children that fat=stupid, bad, ugly and bones=beauty, success, self-control. If you are fat (even if a person is only in the upper end of normal weight it is seen as ""fat"") then you have NO self-control and are just a pig...a pig who just can't control her stupid self to not shove everything she sees into her mouth. Ugh. I am speaking from the heart there.

I never lost weight to be ""healthy"" either---just to be ""skinny"", which actually never came, even though my bones were sticking out (when I was incarcerated) and I had no energy to even leave my cell...I had been diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa years ago because I did the same thing as you are doing.

I had to report her to the program director, who must have talked to her because she never said anything about it to me again. Still, I feel broken because she said that. The other people in the room when she had said it (during Group Therapy) also agree that she was WAY out of line for saying anything of the sort to a person struggling with mental health issues...or even NOT. I got her in trouble and I wanted her fired, but nope--I have her as my Counselor (contact for the Program which is now through the telephone every day) and I hate her with a passion. My Case Manager knows this, but can't do dick about it. :( I am stuck with this fucking twat now. She is so fucking clueless and never even listened to what I was saying for the most part when I would talk to her. She said this awful thing in such an off-hand way, as if we were just girlfriends shootin' the shit on a Friday night.

Pyromania,fqhu95b,t1_fqhok5u,1589384689.0,"Well...how do I embrace it as well as I do?

It doesn't show in my posts, but I am 49 years old (though I have the heart of a teenager--that is why I get on with them so well), and that means I have a LOT of practice with accepting who, and WHAT, I am. I DO struggle with this, just as you do, though. There are some days where I wonder why me? What did I do to be cursed with this horrible thing in my head that won't leave me alone for 5 minutes some days. Constant thoughts of burning--fire--flames--smoke--the smell--the heat--the love radiating off of those shimmering flames. I got in trouble for my, er...hobby early last year.

What happened was that I had burned a rag on the porch of an abandoned house. The porch was covered in vines and made for a perfect little hidey-hole for me to just get my Pyro on. So I did. I burned the rag (was an old shirt or something) and then stomped it out...or so I thought. It turns out that the next door neighbor actually called the fire department to put out a ""fire"" (probably just smoldering) that was the size of a large dinner plate. There was NO damage to the house, or the porch. Still, that kicked things off. That was Oct. 2018...in Nov. and Dec. 2018, I torched 2 Dumpsters in the back of a business...3 weeks apart from each other. I was there, watching and recording the flames, at both, and that gave the FD and the PD enough evidence to start putting 2 and 2 together. It all came to a head, so to speak, when I was caught up on the railroad tracks burning paper in an old ""train box""--an unused metal box about 3 feet off the ground...totally contained and safe. I only scorched the inside a little bit...ok a lot, but nobody uses it so I don't know what that matters. I get it, though. It was private property...and not something I should have been using to burn paper and boxes. I do get why it was wrong. I just think they made a bigger deal out of that at first than they really had to. That (and the Dumpsters) ended up being dropped (Criminal Mischief in the 2nd Degree) anyhow. Thank goodness. I think they wanted to make a point...but they didn't count on the fact that I wasn't doing it maliciously at all. I am mentally ill with a disorder that even my Public Defender (Public Pretender ha) had a hard time dealing with. It came down to the fact that no Psychiatric Hospital (besides the State Hospital) would take me because I had an Arson charge (at that time) and that is a moot point anyhow because there is a year's waiting list for all hospitals right now. I would literally have to attempt suicide to get into psychiatric care. I am not about to do that...though I have considered it several times since I had been arrested. I was put in prison for a year, and was ultimately convicted of Arson in the 3rd Degree on Nov. 20, 2019. I was released with time served on January 3rd, 2020--one year exact to my arrest date. It was hell and it was hard to deal with some people who thought that me being a Pyromaniac was either 1) creepy and dangerous or 2) so cool and hip and fascinating.

So, I can't say I am totally proud of what I am, but I am not hiding it either. I can't hide it because I have a visceral reaction every time I see a fire truck. I can't control that...I just love them and firefighters so much that it makes my heart feel full of love when I see them. No, I can't become a firefighter...or a volunteer because 1) I have diagnosed asthma and am on an inhaler for that 2) I am way too old and out of shape 3) I have an official diagnosis of Pyromania, so the FD isn't really that happy with me right now. I could volunteer to bring drinks to a fireground to help out the firefighters, but there aren't that many fires (structure) in the city and I don't drive, so I can't get to ones outside the city. Hubby won't drive me there.

Well, now I am totally absolutely triggered...I have to go burn something. The other way I get my ""Pyro"" on is to play Team Fortress 2 as -- you guessed it -- The Pyro. My main class, and my favorite character. :)

mentalhealth,fqht82z,t1_fqhprqj,1589384123.0,"What part of it happens all day every day did you not understand? It isn't a thought like ""oh, fire is pretty... I love watching the flames dance."" No, it is more ""I need to set something on fire so I can watch the pretty flames dance for me!"" Every. Day. All. Day. No rest. Little respite from them (I can block them out sometimes and have a ""normal-ish""  day). I am pulled toward the flames even on my dreams. I love fire so much... She is my Animal and ""she"" truly ""loves"" me back. No, I'm not delusional to think that fire actually feels love for me...I just mean that we have a mutual understanding of each other and I have a healthy respect for fire. I have never been burned (yet--have to stick that in there) because of that respect... And I have burned a LOT of things in my time. The vacuum cleaner was the scariest (don't know HOW I had not gotten caught for that bc the smoke was thick and black and it had gone right over the main road) and had melted the sole of my shoes as I tried to put it out. Ok...you can laugh. That was kinda funny. Now, at least. 

So, yeah. If you can't tell...I am most definitely a Pyromaniac through and through (not always a nice thing, nor a fun and good thing) and the Intrusive Thoughts are all part of that.

Btw... I am considered to be a ""Dangerous Person"", though on the lower-end of that danger level. I am also (was and kind of still am) in therapy and on Meds that do nothing to help bc there is no cure for Pyromania and no real known effective treatment for adults with it."
