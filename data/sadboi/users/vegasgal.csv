The OP and every one who contributed to his post means everything to me.

My dad graduated from PCOM Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine in the 1950s. One of my brothers followed in our dad’s footsteps and attended PCOM in the early 190s. 

Having been brought up in an Osteopathic household my dad and our family lived under a cloud of discrimination against DOs by MDs. This prejudice lasted for quite a while. My brother has worked extensively with the American Medical Association in his position as a socially active liaison between MDs and DOs.   
The prejudice against DOs of yesteryear is for the most part a relic of the past.  

Your comments on OP’s post made my day. Thanks to all of you who had nice things to say about the study of Osteopathic Medicine. 

Both my (deceased) father and my brother are/were specialists in psychiatry; physical medicine. Just writing about them to you is giving me the chills and bringing back to me some of the best memories of my life. And now, I’m crying tears of happiness."
petsmart,fns5qb9,t3_fz9qob,1587213463.0,"Ah, yes, the most effective way to get your point across is to defame me by calling me a psycho. To accuse someone of being a fucking psycho and the person to whom you labeled as being psychotic for all the members of Reddit to see,  constitutes libel. Why does your speech rise to the level of libel? Because i do not suffer from mental illness nor am I psychotic. Additionally your words and those of the woman who similarly libeled me have serious implications for both of you. 

You and the other rabid commenter who have libeled me should educate yourselves so that neither of you, by your written purposeful accusations that I am not of sound mind gives me a cause of action against the two of you. Separately and together.

The statute of limitations on libel is two years. I have that amount of time during which I can think about what measures I will take in response to yours and her false, defaming words specifically directed at me."

It’s not THAT you were angry;  that is understandable. That’s your right. What did you expect to accomplish by unleashing your rage against me?

Emotionally speaking, me and the many other Redditors whose  behaviors and post content about which you vehemently disagree and you convey your opinion using the nastiest words and insults in order to drive home to the poster that your position is greater and the only viewpoint that covers every facet of the post’s content. Belittling the poster discredits the message you mean to share.  I am not the only person who, when insulted, flamed and held up to ridicule, feels cornered by your hatred.

How do you think people who simply post on this platform feel when you and others like you unleash on that  poster the your seemingly uncontrollable verbal abuse?

It’s not WHAT you said it’s how you delivered your message.

I do hope that you never find yourself in an abusive situation from which there is no escape. I say this to you because from age five until I went away to college my mother abused each one of the four of us kids. 

When interacting with strangers we can’t know what those strangers have suffered from. I know you didn’t realize that how you treated me brought me right back to the horrors of my childhood. At least I don’t want to believe that invectives you flung at me were designed to bring about the terror and fear that your words did in fact do to me.

There is a legal precept called ‘Intentional Infliction Of Emotional Distress.’ Please, familiarize yourself with this legally actionable tort."

Anger,fn4qrpb,t3_fzih22,1586646956.0,"You might think my suggestion is lame, but in reality it works. There is a ‘thing’ called Mindful Meditation. There is also regular meditation. You can look online to learn how to meditate, how many times a day to meditate. The amount of time per session is between 10-15 minutes. 

Why in the world would I give you an answer that appears on first glance ridiculous. It’s not. If you begin to meditate a couple times a day your overall being will become much calmer. 

Why such an offbeat suggestion?  I spent thousands of hours attending 12 Step groups. These meetings gave me so many coping skills that at age 27, I began growing up emotionally.

One of the best things they taught me was this; you (I) can’t change the actions of those people who wrong you (me). BUT you (I) have the power to change HOW I respond/react to the events out of your control. Meditation will give you control of your emotions. Emotions that you cannot control now when people screw you royally. If you commit to meditating two times a day for 10-15 minutes, despite your default reaction to situations that bring out your anger, the calm and peace that meditation brings to you is your best weapon to change how you respond to these frustrating interactions. The inner peace you get will not only help you in anger provoking interactions, it will change you from a persons who REACTS when provoked into someone who thinks first and acts second."
