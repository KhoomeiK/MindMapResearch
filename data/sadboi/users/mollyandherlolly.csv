breastfeedingsupport,fn28zra,t3_fywk9r,1586581254.0,"When my baby was cluster feeding, I would get her latched and burp her while she fed.  I held her so that she was more vertical by laying back slightly.  This helped release the gas while she was going.  She would pull off, burp, and continue to feed.

I also was taught to sit baby down and, while supporting the neck, rock her in little circles.  This helped with upper and lower gas."
NewParents,fn27wkv,t3_fyf2ey,1586580344.0,"I was in the same boat after leaving hospital.  Been on my own as husband works full time since week 3.  The crying was so difficult.  Let me share a few things:

1. Anticipate needs - you have that bottle or breast ready as soon as he wakes, if crying persists, change diaper and immediately have bottle or breast.  

2. Do not let noise or movement wake him early from sleep.  The baby will do better when the cranky evening/witching hour starts.  Naps are necessary.  Find an evening routine and stick to it.  I breast feed in bed till she passes out roughly 9pm.

3. Find a gentle flow nipple similar to breast feed speed of giving milk.  Also stick to breast or one kind of nipple.  Don't switch it up.  It's confusing and frustrating.  Also, gentle flow cut down on gas.  Burp periodically during feed.  My baby pushes bottle or spits out breast and cries which is almost always gas related.  When the cry gets loudest, it's almost always lower end gas and or a poop on the way.  I have a vibrating chair which helps get gas and poops out with the gentle motion.  Try sitting baby down with knees up, support the neck and rotate in circles - this is a different way to burp them and help bowl related stuff along.  

4. Go through your check list a. Hungry b.dirty diaper c.swaddle or not some babies hate not having arms free d.skin to skin time e.burp/gas

5. My baby likes three songs with skin to skin on my chest feeling vibrations while I sing.  Bend at the knees and hold bum and feet in hand while patting back for help with gas.  

6. If they sleep better co sleeping, do it.  

7. Try not to let them escalate in the first place whenever possible by anticipating needs and keep a journal of naps/feed times and bowel movements.  A baby will have lower end gas 30 min- hour after feeds and higher gas during and up to 30 minutes after feeds.

8. It will get better, breast feeding will get easier, you will get a routine going and you are great parents doing your best.

Ps.  I found a YouTube vid describing different baby cries helpful in my steep learning curve."

It was working really well to ease the pain and I just felt some light pressure on contraction.  For the surgery, because this epidural was being so effective, they loaded me up with medication.  All I felt was pressure and the anesthetist stayed with me near my head the entire surgery to monitor me and provide more medication as needed.  At one point my blood pressure dropped so had a med to counteract that.  I was very comfortable and felt no pain, just gentle tugging sensations, most notably when they pulled baby out.   I was aware and awake the entire surgery and post surgery.  The anesthetist was giving me a bit of a play by play which helped.  Baby was out in ten minutes, surgery took about 30 total with stitching being the most time consuming.

They may have placed spinal epidural if my original epidural was not effective enough - it is basically a port they push medicine into like an IV but in your back.  The insertion was painful, but they freeze you up and the pain didn't last long.  The other alternative to the direct in spinal epidural was a general anesthesia which was not required for me either.  

The nurses on the mat unit were great and my pain was managed well.  I stayed four days and I am very comfortable at home, however light duties for 6 weeks."
