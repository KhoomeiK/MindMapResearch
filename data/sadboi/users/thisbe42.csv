I've also found it helpful to try to build healthy habits, I have a daily planner and I recently got a habit tracker calendar where I can write in my habits and check the box for them each day, which has been really motivating me. Most of the habits are pretty basic, but healthy, things like make the bed, drink 2 bottles of water, take my meds, etc. I find that routine is really good for me because I crave stability in any form. 

Another thing I've been doing for the last few months is writing down one good thing that's happened every day. Some days it's really challenging, and it might be something as basic as, ""I took my dogs for a walk and it made them happy."" But it's a good exercise to focus on (my therapist says ""what we focus on expands""), and now on my bad days I have something to look back on and remind myself that life isn't as terrible as it may seem."

teaching,eok3m4e,t3_bru4m3,1558646661.0,"I just finished my student teaching last week, and worked nights serving at a restaurant the whole time. I started out working 5 nights a week, but after the first month or so, I had to ask to go down to 3 or 4 nights. I was working between 15 and 17 hour days. I did the same thing you're talking about with taking one weekend day off each week - THAT IS GOING TO BE HUGE. That one day off was literally the only time I was able to do anything, like laundry or grocery shopping. I'm not going to lie, it's gonna suck. A lot. 

I was really lucky in that I had a lot of planning time built into my teaching schedule, so I was able to do most of my TWS stuff and website during that time. I also really lucked out that my boyfriend is incredibly supportive; he was totally instrumental in talking care of our pets, and put up with me being constantly exhausted and irritable for 4 months. 

One piece of advice I can give you: invest in a good dry shampoo. You will plan on showering in the morning, or after second work... you will be too tired 90% of the time. One of the hostesses at my second work once asked me how it was going, working and student teaching at the same time. My response was, ""Well, I haven't showered in 4 days, this shirt has lasted 3 shifts so far, I've already worked 29 hours in the last two days on like 5 hours of sleep, and the only reason I have makeup on is that I was too tired to take it off last night.""

The best advice I got from someone else (my therapist): every day, focus on that day. Only focus on what you have to do on the current day. Because if you think about the whole, you're going to get overwhelmed. It creates a weird cognitive dissonance, because you do have to plan ahead to some extent, but it really does help. 

TL;DR: You got this. It's gonna suck a lot, but it is possible."
