heartbreak,f3rvaic,t3_dhhp0k,1571092470.0,Well when girls break up with guys they usually don’t want any contact for a while.

I’m 14 and from my perspective of being a girl maybe she’s just overwhelmed and doesn’t know how to deal with it so she just blocked you and stopped talking to you so she doesn’t feel responsible if you do something to yourself. I mean try taking it day by day. It’s going to take a while to fully get over her."

SuicideWatch,f1gs3w3,t3_d9emq9,1569475534.0,Wow that is beyond anything I’ve ever heard. Honestly get out of there it’s not worth it. If I were you I’d tell my school or even call the cops. You don’t deserve to be in that situation and honestly getting out of there should be your number one priority. God bless you for going through all of that. Honestly I would rather get kicked out then stay there. Go to the police station and tell them what’s happening. You may go into foster care but anything is better then being in that abusive situation
SuicideWatch,f17369s,t3_d7zskx,1569234061.0,"Yea I get you, my mom doesn’t believe in mental health. She just thinks being “strong” and brushing it off is a solution but it’s not. Maybe it has something to do with how your mom was raised and brought up. My mom is mexican and grew up in Mexico where she didn’t really have an education and had to work with 7 of her other sibling. So I understand where you are coming from. Honestly do things to distract you, that’s the only thing that’s keeping me from doing anything stupid. Try getting into a sport, try getting a job, study hard so you can get out. I know you have people telling you “it’ll get better” and stuff like that but you gotta stick it through. Set up easy goals for your self and work from there. Talk to your school counselors I’m sure they’ll listen if you vent to them. I was cutting myself and my mom just laughed it off and said I was doing it for attention.I get it. I hope things get better for you. I know things seem rough but you can’t let your mom control your emotions screw her. Just ignore her, if you have headphones great. Do things to distract yourself really. Go day by day. Anyways hope things improve!"
