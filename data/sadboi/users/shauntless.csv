Hashimotos,fp9fd1b,t1_fp804ej,1588424664.0,"I’ve been getting extremely angry & depressed a lot too & I thought that was just my “moods” playing up. But now that I’ve read your comment, it must be because of my thyroid. I started taking my Thyroid tablets again after over a year of being off it (did it myself, felt like I didn’t need it anymore) but looking back, I can now see most of that time was extremely exhausting for me. I’m 22f, was diagnosed when I was 13 & the main symptoms I had was being freezing all the time, puffy “chipmunk” face as I called it, not losing weight, pale. & this whole year where I didn’t take tablets, I didn’t get “puffed” up until about 2 months ago when I noticed my face was getting bigger and resembled a lot of my chipmunk face when I was undiagnosed. Long story, sorry lol but thanks for your comment, it made me realise I’m not crazy in being angry, I’ve just got a dodgy thyroid & I should seriously stick to taking my tablets."
depression,fp2hn5e,t3_gajysh,1588261913.0,I’m socially useless too & it fkn sucks. I think my friends secretly hate me cos I’m so fkn boring & awkward when I hang around them.

I scared of the result that will occur from facing them and attempting to cut them off. I’m scared of what will happen and what they will say.  Thank you for your comments tho, it really does help!"
depression,fhxe53x,t1_fhxdrqt,1581952229.0,"thanks for your help, no but I’m just thinking of working for a couple months then leave. Idk my heads kind of all over the place. Like she sees leaving as thinking that “I’m too good” for my family when all I’m doing is growing up and wanting to do my own thing for a while. Like at home right now, I don’t even have my own room, I have no privacy, I have no place to cry which means I am constantly holding in my emotions and it’s been like this since I was 17! I just want to go experience life and do my own thing. They don’t see it that way so they emotionally abuse me and I am sensitive asf so I can’t take it."
depression,fhxcpvu,t1_fhxcgby,1581951200.0,"I’ve tried but they always stop me. I worked all of last year & then I always have to give money to this person & that, then it was Xmas so now I’m broke asf. Could start working here again but this town and my family is toxic asf so I just want to escape. Idk what I’m doing with my life anymore. I just feel shitty and lost."

SuicideWatch,f1ss085,t3_danvqp,1569733237.0,"Hannah, I hope you are ok and safe right now. I hope that when you felt all hope was lost, a sparkle of hope glimmered. Those that hurt feel so much more deeply than those who don't. I can feel you pain, it almost amplifies in my soul. You are twelve, but already I can tell you are so mature beyond your years, you spill wisdom onto the page and you radiate happiness. 

I too struggle and I know I am not what my family was expecting either and theres much more. The ache that you feel when you realise how truly broken and alone you are sucks and no words can explain it huh?! Well, Hannah, If you are still walking this earth, know I am here for you.

Hannah, if you are know gone to explore the stars, just know that I know you existed and that you DID make your mark and for as long as I breathe, I will not forget you."

depression,f0isxjt,t1_f0igrj6,1568646481.0,"Thanks for sharing. I guess we are all lost souls in the same boat. I like to think that I am destined for greatness, but then I wonder, who too over history has felt the same but contributed nothing. Who else in history gave their all, but felt worthless and died alone. 

Maybe the whole reason I feel like I need to make my mark is because I fear being forgotten. Yeah, that is probably 80% of it, but that 20% of me really does think I am ""someone."" I can and I will make my mark on society. I will help people. I will be remembered. 

Argh. Maybe I'm just manic or maybe I need sleep. Idk. All I know is that I am broken, have been for a while. But I am also full with so much wisdom and I can't just keep that to myself until the grave.

p.s- I would love to read your poem once it's done."
depression,f0irx2v,t1_f0iibse,1568646069.0,"It feels good that others can relate, so thanks for replying. But yeah, like, I feel like I am running out of time to be the person I was 'destined' to be. I too could be doing something beneficial and meaningful rn but I am complaining about my troubles online. It is paralysing, to think that you could single handedly save the world in some way or another, but you take a step back from this ""middle of the night, sudden bout of inspiration"" and see that you would never be able to, plus who would even look up to you or care what you have to offer society. 

It's hard to live with a mind that is so visionary but full of constant road blocks and criticism. It's hard to always feel like you are on the verge of making or breaking it in this world. 

Also, I will check out that video. Thank you.

You enjoy your day/night as well, I am about to go to sleep, but I hope some day or in some time, we can achieve or be the person we are supposed to be."
socialanxiety,f0ih939,t3_d4tabj,1568641717.0,"omg yes! I thought it was just me. Like it's so bad, that I struggle to keep a conversation going  with friends that I've known pretty much my whole life. Like I started to see my social skills decline when I was in my final year of school, when I was 17. I am now 21 and people that once couldn't shut me up because I talked too much, can't even get me to say a whole sentence. Idk what's wrong with me. When I get invited out with them, I say no, because I know I will just sit there in silence. I don't fit in anymore & it sucks because it has ruined my life."
SuicideWatch,f0abvrw,t3_d4037y,1568512923.0,"dude, I know exactly how you feel. I have no purpose, I am annoying, Like I annoy people without trying. And most times, I know when I'm being annoying but I just can't stop it. My family has even told me that no one want's me around. I wish I was different, I wish I could fit into my friend groups again. I wish I was better, skinnier, funnier, smarter. I just want to change altogether or simply disappear."
twentyonepilots,ezyunvr,t3_d2ue39,1568275003.0,wait is this real?! I NEED NED ASAP!
depression,ezyuiyy,t1_exjuiqr,1568274924.0,"I only just got around to reading this and thanks so much, it means a lot, truly. Today I feel really empty for some reason, just floating around, not really thinking about anything, not really caring, just feeling like I want to sleep forever. Your reply is everything & by the end of this year I will be moving to the city with someone I consider my forever friend, I can't wait to leave this town & all the negativity with it."
depression,exjsk48,t1_ewly5oz,1566359125.0,"It's really hard to explain my situation with my family & I can't tell them what's going on. I've tried before, it just turns out my family is filled with negative people that don't realise their actions/words can hurt. The worst part is that I'm 21 now & I've been back at home since Dec. I don't have anyone to talk you. I'm planning to move back to the city with a friend of mine in Dec/Jan, I'm trying so hard to hold on til then. However, I am afraid the pain will still haunt me, even once I have moved. You see, I have spent the last 3 years in the city, living & going to uni. My family still hurt me. I hate being sensitive. I hate feeling everything. I hate overthinking. 

Also the things with my friends is, I'm not really sure. I guess I lost myself along the way between graduating high school & now. I can't remember who I was & I hate myself for it. Like I can't even hold a conversation with people I've known my whole life! Idk what's wrong with me. It sucks because I miss out of socialising, I miss out on friendships that are supposed to ""last a lifetime."" It's not only old friends though, I can't even go out bowling for example, with uni mates. Like arghhhh why can't I be normal?!!!

& yea life is hectic. I wish it could slow down most times. I often escape in music or my imagination. I do self harm as well but I haven't since June. I've been trying hard to not do it again recently. Oh, did I mention, I also feel like I'm failing at my job. Like I honestly feel like a waste of space there, & that's not even my corrupted mind thinking, It's just the way it is. Life is just really overwhelming for me at the moment, I don't think I was made for this. 

Sorry this is a lot, it probably doesn't even make sense."
SuicideWatch,ewle7uc,t3_cop5yp,1565519861.0,"same, like I can't even remember what it felt like to go though the day without thinking about suicide!"

SuicideWatch,ewbrbmn,t1_ewbqd04,1565271137.0,"True. It's just so hard to keep going when everyone around you makes you feel like crap. I am so sensitive which doesn't help & it sucks!

depression,evsmssu,t3_cl0x7g,1564751118.0,"omg I thought it was just me! I used to be so smart, talkative, bubbly, cheeky even. I could make a room full of people laugh but now, omg, now I am a whole different person & I hate it. I can't even talk to a mate without wishing a hole would form under my feet & swallow me alive. I walk around at work & all I can see is a grey world in front of me, the other staff must think I'm so arrogant & boring because I answer with one words or a laugh because I'm so awks & I can't even hear wtf they are saying, even when I've asked them to repeat a few times! I used to be the biggest book worm but now I can't even get through a page before I lose focus. I get asked to do the simplest task & I fail to complete it properly. I feel so dumb. I miss the old me.. I guess growing being the ""mature"" and ""wise"" kid beyond my years, only went I was going to grow up & be dumb & depressed by the time I'm 21. Gee, thanks depression."

socialanxiety,ev9exvx,t3_cisv2m,1564319469.0,"That was the same as me when I was at school. I never talked in class, even though my classes were filled with the same kids for 5 years, I never spoke unless I couldn't avoid it. I graduated in 2015 & I thought my anxiety would be gone by now but nope, still here & worser than ever! I mum doesn't know but I wish she did, but if I told her it would unravel a big mess, which would include my depression which is a whole other story. I do prefer being at home, just listening to music, being in my own bubble. But it also sucks when I wan't or are wanted to hang out but I can't because I can't handle the social pressure. At work a couple months ago, I got asked to read out loud and I started crying because even the thought of reading aloud was too much for me. Social anxiety is ruining my life, I think I need medication but Idk, I'm just feeling really helpless & thinking too much rn. Here if you need btw xx"
socialanxiety,ev9e7gv,t3_cisfo7,1564318724.0,"This is me described so well! Growing up I was always told I was ""mature"" but now I'm 21 but I lack in socialising. I become distant from friends because I feel that they don't like me. With friends I've known for 10+ years, I can't speak to them the way I used to because I feel like what I say doesn't matter & that they have better things to do than to be talking to me. I failed uni because I couldn't cope with going to classes with people I barely knew & speaking & sharing my opinions. I am now miserable at work, I am the youngest employee and I feel like everyone is talking behind my back. The legit only communication I use is one worded answers, smiles, nods & nervous laughs. I honestly feel like I am not needed & a waste of space. I tear up (sometimes cry) when I am surrounded by too much people, or when I am asked a question in front of others. I did miss out on my teenage years because I was so anxious all the time & it's stopping me now too because I automatically want to run from new opportunities that are out of my comfort zone (which is very small might I add.) For example, Me & my best friend are going to dinner together but he invites one of his mates, I suddenly do not want to go. Anxiety is ruining my life & I don't know what to do?? I feel like others see me as boring, arrogant, ungrateful etc, when In fact it's just a struggle for me have social interactions. On top of having extreme social anxiety, it does not help that I am sensitive! I wish I was normal so badly!"
