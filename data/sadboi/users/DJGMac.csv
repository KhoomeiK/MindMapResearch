edit: I should point out I have BPD and anger management issues. Angermangement/BPD Irrational beliefs tend to go hand in hand.

I'd reccomend you read ""How to control your anger before it controls you"" By Albert Ellis. Although it might not be your exact problem, the Irrational Belief sheet's that you can find in the back of the book help extremely well with working on your every day issues."

Download bios, put on an empty USB key, plug into PC, boot into motherboard bios, find the update section, update from USB key. Voila.
