Anxiety,flsk3ps,t3_fo6h6w,1585443947.0,Anyone else on fb that looks at the covid 19 doctors stuff. Because I think that makes it worse. Because they share alot on there and they saying about younger people.

Anxiety,flpsxng,t3_fo6h6w,1585367916.0,"Ever since my wife came home from saying someone had a cough. The next day my belly pain started. And then everything else went to hell after that. I have not been able to eat or sleep. I'm always looking online at numbers.like today. I was out side doing yard work and got winded.and then my chest started to hurt on left side. And checked my temp and it was fine and I even started to take notes on how I feel and when. And tonight I went for a walk and chest got tight. And I played down and put Netflix on and it went away. At lest until I looked once again. I even wake up in the middle of the night scared because I was dreaming I was in a hospital bed. And I keep getting the when I stand up I'm lightheaded. And if I cough I look online right away. And this is the only the 2nd time I have felt like this and looked it up and I have every symptoms of health anxiety. It sure sucks. Everyone tells me to stop looking stuff up but it's hard. And here in mn we only have 4 deaths so far and that's 4 to many. And If i could post my history off my phone you would probably tell me I'm nuts. And everytime I try to talk to someone they only tell me it's in my head. I even did that covid19 online screening about 7 times already. Everytime i have a symptom i think I'm on there. I only have acouple anxiety pills left. Because like i said this the 2nd time I ever had this. The doctor only gave me enough to make it through the meds I was on they were methylprednisolone. And that stuff messed with my head bad. And see I have not been anywhere to get the virus but in my head it keeps telling me I have it. And reading all these comments from other people going through the same thing I am makes me a little happy because I thought I was the only one. And it makes me feel a little better reading all these. So thank you everyone for sharing your stuff. Because with out all of you I would be lost in my own head like always. Just wish they would start saying good things on the news like how many people have made it and are ok. Instead of the dang death toll. 


Thanks for reading my misspelled long stuff that font make much sense to some.

Anxiety,fllc3kx,t3_fo6h6w,1585257499.0,"Hey everyone. 

I'm from mn and as you can see are numbers are lower then most with 2 deaths but yet I'm always taking my temp thinking I have it.not until I had a pinched nerve in my back that my mom said I was having a heart attack is when it all started all in this month. And now with this covid19 stuff everywhere. I keep looking online at numbers. And then my chest feels tight and then I read about symptoms and then I start worrying. Because it seems the more and more i read the more and more I seem to have symptoms of it. And I'm not sure if it's my heath anxiety anymore or if I really do have them. And I have a fear of death that's making it worse for me. I wake up fine with no symptoms really but the min I'm fully awake is when they hit me hard. And then I get dizzy. And feel like laying down all day. So here is what the symptoms I have been having. Wired feelings in chest that seem to go away once in awhile and then i read about direaha and then guess what I have it. Is that just my health anxiety doing this to me. Any help would be great"
