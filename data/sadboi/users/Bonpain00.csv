Anxiety,fmikggk,t3_fv6vhu,1586111365.0,"Sadly I can't really relate. My anxiety often derive from home. Though, since many of the ""musts"" have disappeared I've taken the time to figure out the different issues in my life that cause the anxiety in the first place. I've worked really hard to fix my sleep. I've started meditating a lot more. I've stopped surpressing my feeling by constantly listening to podcasts/watching series (I was so addicted I couldn't go to the bathroom without a sound in my ears), and I've started to write down my feelings, the things I have done, the things I should do and how to do them. All of this has brought some structure into my life that I hope will help decrease my anxiety in the long run. So in conclusion this pandemic has given me some time to figure shit out that shouldve been figured out a long time ago. :)"

Look at it like that, and now move forward with full force. :)"

Sometimes, once every few months or so, I get a very unique feeling of seeing the world from a very clear third perspective. Like Im standing outside the universe looking in with total clarity. It's an amazing feeling but it only lasts for a second or two. It usually happens when I'm tangled up in existential thoughts questions / mysteries that science does not have an amswer to. Does anyone recognise this feeling? 
Perhaps better to ask psychology for this but thought id try here aswell."
