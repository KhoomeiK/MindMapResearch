Giving you money for college isnt enough; your family should have been there for you when your brother died, or when Ryan died, or when your grandmother died. At your side, not hurling accusations.

I'd say the first thing you should try to focus on is bringing up your gpa and continuing university. Tell your parents you can't finish yet because of the break you took. That it physically isnt possible and you need more money. You can also talk to your school's financial aid office about funds if your family refuses to pay. That makes you an independent and you are likely to get more aid that way. After that you can worry about getting a well-paying job, etc.

It seems like you've been taught your life to blame yourself for things that aren't your fault or aren't that big of a deal. Maybe you messed up with money, or with some classes, whatever. It happens, it isn't the end of the world. Don't beat yourself up over it, just take a deep breath and start brainstorming ways to move forward. That's what matters now.

When you complete your UC application you will need to check a box and submit a letter to the CCS Physics faculty. In this letter you will sell yourself for the program. The faculty (the advisor that will mentor and teach you) then hand-selects 20-30 students for the program each year. For this reason, who you are as a person and how passionate you are about physics matters a lot more than exactly what scores and grades you got. Some of the students our year have already taken all of the lowerclassmen math coursework theough community college before getting to UCSB. Some have much less experience. A few have no traditional physics experience. The only set requirement is completion of AP Calculus BC (or equivalent, and you will need it).

Sometimes our time with a person is limited, but brevity does not make that time any less special. She still loved you, you still had the time of your life with her. She may be gone sooner than you had hoped, but the pages of your life spent with her will always be a part of you and nothing can change that. Celebrate that chapter of your life, mourn over its short length, but look forward to the next chapter all the same.


You're a more experienced person from the time you spent with her, and how you choose to move forward from this heartbreak  will also define your growth as a person. It feels like your life is crumbling around you, but these events are making you stronger.


She didn't leave because you weren't good enough or because you failed. You simply became incompatible with eachother, and that isn't something to beat yourself up over. She does not define your value as a person, and you will find someone who recognizes you for how great you are and who is far more compatible. I know that that's hard to believe now, but it's true. The weirdest and most liberating feeling after months of heartbreak and solitude is realizing that you can fall in love again, and that he/she wasn' t the only person for you.

I had some trouble following the plot too, since I spent so much time fighting and exploring that I forgot why I was doing it. I'm fairly sure it goes like this:  [WARNING-EVEN LONGER POST]

Cere and Greez overhear the inquisitors are headed to Bracca, so they come to rescue you. They are searching for someone to help them find the holocron, which Cordova has hidden away. Cordova had forseen the jedi purge, and knew that someone would need the list of force-sensitives to rebuild the order one day. He left behind BD-1 to select who would preserve the jedi order and succeed him, in his eyes. That person ends up being you, and Cordova sends you on an educational (and dangerous) journey to Zeffo to prove your worth by retrieving the astrium kept there. Unfortunately the 2nd sister gets it first, and you are forced to use clues from Cordova's notes to find where others might be. His comments on Kashyyyk and Dathomir lead you to those two places, which apparently also involved the zeffo. You reach the top of the origin tree on Kashyyyk in search of an astrium, or answers, and you find out that Cordova found his astrium there. He mentions how relieved he is that he doesn't need to return to dathomir, where another astrium is held. You then go to Dathomir to find said Kujet's astrium, which you use to unlock the vault. Then all the other shit goes down and you realize that your search for the holocron will not save the jedi, but will doom children that would have been hidden if not for you. So you destroy it, and your entire search for the holocron is meaningless. However, you confront your past, embrace your future, and make a lot of new friends along the way. You also help to heal the worlds you visit, by destroying corruptors like Malicos or *shudders* Oggdo Bogdo. 

I think one of the reasons this game's plot is hard to follow is because it's a character-focussed story. It's about trauma and failure, acceptance and growth. Greez, Cere, Merrin, AND Cal all deal with these themes and have arcs. The plot is mostly arbitrary, and isn't what's important by the end of the story."
FallenOrder,f8innsp,t3_e0vxrp,1574590786.0,"1- the astrium, but she doesn't know how to use it. I THINK Cordova found the astrium on Kashyyyk after giving up on dathomir, and then hid it on Zeffo for us to find as part of his ""test"" to see if we were worthy to posess the holocron. When the 2nd sister finds it instead, we are forced to go to dathomir and find the astrium that Cordova could not.

2- From my interpretation, a member of the zeffo. Perhaps kujet? Venturing between Bogano, Zeffo, and Dathomir you observe a gradual fall to the dark side for the zeffo priests. On bogano things are light and simple, with nature complimented by the temple ruins. On Zeffo things are more complicated, as you have priests like Miktrull who begin self-agrandizing and overworking their people (you find an abused worker's skeleton in his tomb). Lastly, Dathomir represents the total corruption of the Zeffo philosophy, and their fall to the dark side. The Zeffo being blinded by pride and falling because of it is meant to parallel the fall of the jedi order, and teach Cal why he can't just create a new order and teach his own set of younglings. That's part of why he is spoken to by all those Zeffo priests during the mirror sequence on bogano. Cal learns that he needs to trust in the force's guidance above himself.

3- what the vault held before the holocron, I have no idea. Interesting question."
