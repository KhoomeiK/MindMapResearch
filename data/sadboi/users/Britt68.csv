But... if your doctor isn't using the med for many others or if they have better insurance than you do, you can probably get at least a year's worth.  This also adds to your doctor being able to document that he's been sampling the med, the positive effect on you and thus lots of real justification to get prior authorizations or cost assistance straight from the company.

I have had doctors in the past that I could not get a hold of very easily. So incredibly frustrating!

Were you trying to get assistance for Vyvanse via Shire, by any possibility?  I have heard they are ""picky"" about that one? I have no idea if that's correct or not. I have had to use Adderall and then stopped it because it was fueling mania, possibly. Vyvanse is better, I think.

EatCheapAndHealthy,fdd73co,t3_ejr1qs,1578297716.0,"Knew a person who was morbidly obese. She got a great job. It was about 25 hr per week car travel, aside from the regular commute- seriously. In her 30's she wanted the career and wanted to turn her health around (some typical weight-related stuff). Took the job. A couple times per week snacks were brown-bagged, but really just a couple days and those were snacks.

She relied on making her very best choices at fast food restaurant drive throughs. Some examples that I remember were all sandwiches without mayo, extra mustard added, extra veggies. Said she had lots of chicken sandwiches, salads as sides, diet sodas or water. If there was a drive through Subway that was something she welcomed. Also subs with meat, no extra sauces, extra veggies and stuck with 6"" subs. Would add an individual baked potato chip of some kind with a diet soda- I guess the meal deal. She would also get 2 Mc Donald's burgers-1 cheese, 1 regular, a small fry and water/diet drink. Wendy's had baked potatoes at that time, don't know about these days- she would have a baked potato and a small chili and water or diet drink. At Taco Bell, she had a couple of bean burritos. For breakfast, when leaving early she told me about eating a breakfast sandwich and an apple juice or breakfast burritos at Del Taco. When in a hotel or motel there were apparently often free buffet b-fasts. Lots of pastries. She stayed clear of those and had coffee, English muffin, usually 2, with low or no fat cream cheese or 1/2 bagel and full fat cream cheese and some strawberries, for ex.  She'd have fruit salads for snacks sometimes or a chicken wrap from KFC. She told me a snack could be 1 regular burger at BK or McDonald's.

In 1yr she was 80lb lighter! Her Rx medicines were cut way back, I saw copies of her lab results and they were all normal, that was expensive... and she needed to buy a whole new wardrobe.

So, while I don't really like fast food myself, my friend helped me to realize that where there is a will there is a way. If you must use fast food you do it the best way possible. She also proved this by being creative with exercise while driving so much.

She walked in parking lots of the fast food restaurants or of the motel/hotel or of the location where she would be working,she walked on motel/hotel gym treadmills, and around her neighborhood in the early morning when home- an average of 5:7 days per week of walking someplace.

Pretty amazing and boiled down to good choices."

That 500$ for pizza/other food ""out"" or take away is per month, per term, semester, year? Idk. I'm unclear, sorry, In whatever case, you have some nice  options that fit into your eating plan readily available to you. I would use the 500$ in a mindful way with these sources.  I have some concern that limiting what you eat so much may impact your health. Being a student requires more nutrition/kcal than some realize. I have learned through research that we may need to continue gaining a couple of pounds per year, even into our mid twenties. This seems to be for final development of internal organs and perhaps bones; can't quite remember that one. Makes sense, though, especially in women because bone density is such a thing.

You said you want to do keto, if I understand you correctly, and mainly plant based? Just a warning, last Spring I went serious keto. I used strips to measure whether or not I was in ketosis. I got there in just under average time. Weight then fell off of me at an alarming rate. In 8 days I was down one entire bra cup size. I was great at keto. My body could not tolerate it. I felt terrible in about 11 days. I need carbs- all types of carbs. In early Summer I had a blood test that showed I was anemic. I had been off the mainly plant based version of keto for about 10 weeks. I felt horrible. Again. I bit the bullet and began allowing small amounts of meat/fish into my diet. (I required some supplements at that point, which I am still on- at least most). I felt really guilty about meat/fish and at the same time within a week I *actually looked* healthier. I was shocked, because I really though vegetarianism was for me. It is a challenge to do a keto that is plant based too! As I'm sure you know!

I continue to eat some meat/fish 6:7 days per week. It's hard on me. I gained 3lb back right away and 2 weeks later things had evened out again. I focus on losing 1.75lb per week. It costs me about $40.00-$45.00 per week in food, on average, incl. the occasional eating out. I do invest in decent quality supplements that are needed.

If you have a Trader Joe's you can acsess, I highly recommend checking them out, if you don't already. I love Dollar Tree too. The one I frequent has edamame in their snack section. A pack is a meal for me.

Have you checked your diet out with a health care professional? For example, a registered dietician through the student health service might be helpful, or even a doctor if an RD isn't on staff.

A personal goal for you and your husband could be to strive to get him behaving more vulnerable and this will take time. My guess is he is really emotionally younger than almost 16-ish young people. If you had a 3yo you would be teaching respect and manners constantly. This kiddo is kind of like that in some ways. You can do the same teaching as with a little one with the type of  quality of respect and tone you'd give to a teen- often matter-of-fact has been a winner for me.

Fosterparents,fdcuur5,t1_fclrpfe,1578284966.0,"If you look at it super carefully, while going to soccer practice/games is really excellent, it is not exactly the same as kicking the soccer ball around *with* him (asking him for advice about how to do ""x"" kind of kick, etc.) or playing Monopoly or cards *with* him. I always learned the ""To"","" For"" and ""With"" for kids, especially those in out of original home placement and moreso from those with a history of abuse and neglect.  ""With"" is usually seen as most effective. In my experience ""with"" was almost always best in these situations. And yes, you will be tired for a while, but prob for less time than continuing as you have been.

A chore that is a ""with"" could be a starting point here. Could the whole family turn on some music and clean in a positive atmosphere? For example, everyone cleans the kitchen together. Could you or your husband clean the bathroom with him? Gradually, maybe very graduallyüòâ, do a little less. You can talk with him while he does more of the chore after he had had some time doing it completely with an adult in the family. Allowing him to choose just 1 chore, other than basic picking up like putting his dishes in the sink, dishwasher, etc. would be the way I would start. Teach him to negotiate this in an ethical manner. 

I personally, would let the room be his thing, within a couple parameters. For example, maybe he can eat a snack in there before going to sleep, but the dishes come back the next day and are out in the appropriate spot. Food wrappers get thrown away, you can ex plain about not wanting to draw ants.  Towels and clothing need to be washed too and not left in his room filthy for months. For the moment, I would have his responsibility to gather clothes and towels and put them in the appropriate location. This could be in your car once a week to go to the laundry mat or in bags or baskets near the washer. I would let him decide if he would like you to set the clean stuff in his room or if he would like to bring it in himself. Once in his room, I'd let hanging or folding completely go for now. Pick your battles. üòâ They are back in his room and that's the current goal, I'd work on. Teens more often than not have messy rooms. Also, no intentional property damage to the room and I'd go over what causes *unintentional* damage too, it's simply part of learning.

And yeah, teens are typically not thrilled by chores! It honestly is not on his radar that you guys are tired. He may well be overtired himself and need help regulating this. How much sleep is he getting on school nights? Does he sleep a little extra on weekends? In other words,is he getting adequate sleep for his situation? He could potentially need 10 hr of sleep a night, especially if he is ready to grow a little more or just because 10 hr is what he needs now. There's lots of info around (online and hard copy about kids getting inadequate, insufficient sleep.

Has he been seen by a pediatrician or family doctor who you really believe in? I would want to rule out anything medical (including depression and anxiety disorders) if I were you. Did he arrive to you properly nourished? Does his doctor think a multi vitamin-mineral supplement for an active teenager who may not have had the best baseline nutrition is a good idea? Pediatricians and adolescent medical specialists are also usually great about advocating for adequate sleep.

How are his grades? How do his teachers perceive him? His soccer coach? Other family and family friends? I would want preserve his privacy, but parents are often communicating with school staff and casually asking family and friends about these things without being disparaging of their kiddos. This might give you a way to gauge where he is compared to other kids. The idea is not to ""compare"" him, per se' in a competitive sense at all.  Instead, the idea is to get information that will help you two work with him.

I hope you can have some fun with each other. It might work wonders.

One last thing, if you go this route, when you meet with him (and for a couple of reasons I'd suggest doing so at a coffee shop or diner or cafe, etc.) to explain the new way the family will work with each other and how his room is his deal- with the caveats you deem crucial and how you are all going to do a board game/card game/checkers, chess, whatever similar game (Jenga might be a really big hit!) each week plus something else interactive (family soccer, frisbee, badmitten, shooting hoops, going for a walk or short hike,etc.) also weekly; I would make dinners together absolutely non-negotiable. It's amazing what eating dinner together can do to build up a family. (Btw, I would write this all out as you discuss as a family and/or even audio record it after asking his permission)  Family dinner could not be more important than in cases of neglect, abuse, imho. Even if you are racing to practices and are having to use drive through fast food once a week, you follow through by eating with him. Even vegetarians can find something to make a meal of at fast food places! üòâ Dinner is an anchoring point. Maybe Sundays could be your  family brunch that is also expected of him. Simple stuff that is fun and to begin with just your immediate family would be my suggestion. You are added positives to his memory card, which helps with neglect pretty often over the long haul. 

Also, after the family meals have kicked into gear for several weeks, encouraging him to ask a school friend, neighbor or another soccer player to eat with you once in awhile might be nice. You might be doing the other kid a real favor too. A win-win. The meals can be simple and not break the bank. Spaghetti with red sauce (using jarred sauce is great, imho!) a take and bake baguette from the store and a partially pre-made salad that you add to with a couple choices of dressings is easy and you might have leftovers. Having cheese as a topping for the salad is usually a hit for kids (and adults!) and this adds protein. Parmassean cheese for spaghetti (salad too) is a great way to add calcium and protein, imo.

Best of luck!!"

In your case, I think I would go through county foster care. Your guy's needs are high and both you and the teen need every single bit of support you can get. Shortly, he may need to begin preparing for where he might reside as an adult. If you foster until 21, that takes pressure off of the timeline. He could really make strides with extra supports you can (and deserve!) to obtain for the two of you.

If he can ride the bus and needs transportation, a bus pass is added support. Maybe it seems small to you, but if you are worried about bankruptcy it seems that anything that is functional and takes stress off of you financially is worth it. Bus passes are just one example.

Are you actually able to do this care for at least a few more years? You are saying you were tricked and that must be so difficult. These next several years might be filled with transition (and 16.5 is a transitional age developmentally for any teen) which stirs up psychiatric challenges that already exist and even can ""bring out"" new ones. The last thing I want to do is to discourage you and yet I want to bring up the fact that he could possibly do well in a residential facility (group home type of thing) with you as his advocate and being super active in his life overall. 

My point is that you have. some choices to make; all of the way from bus passes to a placement outside of your home and many in between. Whoa! It's a lot. Have you considered seeing a counselor for *your well-being* or attending meet up support groups, so someone can hear your thoughts face:face?


Your post has a title about ""failure."" If you decide he needs another placement, you have *not* failed.  You are making decisions that in his best interest as well as your's. You've provided him with as much stability as his challenges will allow in the time you've cared for him. What you've put in that is so positive will not disappear if he needs a higher level of care.

Some examples are leaving her some fuzzy socks on her bed (1$ at Dollar Tree and they are great!) before she changes into her PJ's. If she likes cats (just an example) you might be able to watch cat videos online( if you have some type of internet acsess) or you can search through a cat magazine together. Leaving small, free or inexpensive gifts around for her is a favorite of mine. It's the N.

Seeing that your daughter is comfortable and is pampered a little is such a great way for moms and daughters to bond. Making sure she has all of the hygiene/grooming products she needs is a way to to this. She probably needs products for her period and buying these with her (what she really wants to use) and ""pretending"" if you need to, that it is as normal (which it is!) as picking up shampoo is so important.  If she feels safe enough to take a long bath, you could fill the tub  and give her a bath bomb, so popular lately, or bath salts which are great for relaxation, imho! These can be made at home (you could do that together!!) or purchased inexpensively.

 Do you say goodnight to her after she snuggles into bed? That could be a ritual for the 2 of you and help in bonding/comfort. All of the parental things you can do at bedtime are often especially important. Bringing her an extra blanket, an extra pillow, asking if she has any last minute needs for school the next day that you could take care of- once in awhile, putting a bottle/glass of water by her bed, wishing her ""sweet dreams,"" even at 16üòä- there are so many ideas. Don't forget ""safe,"" appropriate physical affection when you feel *she* is comfortable enough.

Your feelings seem to be lying to you somewhat, at least. Or they have in the past. You don't deserve to suffer, that's your illness telling you lies. Did you get a diagnosis when you were inpatient?

If just the actual making of the appt. with the psychiatrist is too much, you could look for someone who you could book an online appt with. That might be a little easier. The other thing is you could have someone you trust with you while you make the appt by phone. If the doctor's office allows it, you might be able to get a trusted person to book that initial appt for you- just as a one time kind of thing.

Parenting,fd1snpi,t3_ejr4yj,1578136186.0,"I have worked with people who have been through things like you and your sister have. It must be really tough for both of you. I admire you immensely!

Just a couple things to keep in mind: She might crave those rules and boundaries she ""hates"" so much. They add to a feeling of stability and security over time. She could be testing you to see if she really is safe and secure or if you will cave and let her be out of control and will actually feel more fearful/less safe/secure.

Another thing is her talk of suicide concerns me. If she even tried something to show you she was angry at an impulsive moment, she could do permanent damage to herself or even die. I would take her to her pediatrician or the family doctor and see what s/he thinks. If you can make an appt. with a child/adolescent psychiatrist, I'd do that. 

If you or she feels/thinks she is in danger please get help through the E.R. (or E.D.) or 911. It's not worth risking it.

You are doing (as someone implied or said) Hero Parenting. And you are still healing too, I would guess. Do you have a therapist or counselor you can talk with for your well being? Is that something that might be useful, maybe?

Remember that it is not just the next few years you will need to get through. Honestly, you are kind of in it for life.‚ò∫ It can be an amazingly beautiful experience, filled with tons of jabs of pain along the way! Lol!

You are kind of saving your sister, you know? I am sure you know. You've been through the system and it's no picnic, I know.

Also, don't neglect yourself. As you said, you are 22 and that makes parenting more difficult. Parenting this kiddo would not be a walk in the park for anyone, but you do have more of a challenge being young and so close in age to her. You can do it, though. Get all of the support you can- it can help drown out those who say things that are negative. Little things that you can do for yourself are important. An hour long bath is good self care (as long as you like baths‚ò∫). Taking excellent care of yourself is obviously good for you, and is also good role modeling for your sister.

Oh btw, I love that you are insisting on ""C""'s-above for  for your sister. Insisting on A's or B's only is setting her up for disaster, imho.  Bright kids who have been in the system are very commonly behind in school. It's so wonderful that you are directly involved with the school. This is another way she will find stability, at some point.

I'm sure you have prob  already addressed this, but you have lots on your plate, so in case it slid off the plate... working on contraception and having condoms easily available is probably super important for pregnancy protection and disease protection.

You can try Greek yogurt for added protein and Icelandic as well. I just bought Icelandic on sale at Safeway and it has more protein than Greek.  Baked potatoes topped with sour cream and melted cheese (cheddar, for ex.) are also a good option, imo. With baked potatoes, I would go with organic, wash the skin thoroughly, zap in the microwave and eat the skin too- great fiber source which keeps you full longer, usually. Cottage cheese is something I also recommend.

If you have a Trader Joe's around I highly recommend it for both the food/products and price!! It can be amazing. TJ's has excellent prices, as well as an excellent selection on cheeses- amongst other items.

Have you ever thought about a basic vitamin-min supplement too? A basic type can provide an insurance policy for many vitamins and minerals, as long as you don't have any medical reasons not to take one. Also, you might want to research probiotics too.

I get that you also need someone to listen and help with what is going on in your mind and life, but you need to be as physically healthy as possible.

I had suicidal thoughts almost every day for a very, very long time. Finally, a treatment came along (when I thought the only thing left was ECT) that worked. It just worked to blow the constant suicidal thinking up. I continue with this and a whole medication cocktail, as the psychiatrists call it.

OCD,fcwy1cv,t3_ej207q,1578042516.0,"So great! 

In my case, I wanted ERP to be available and practiced by a very skilled provider to overcome my OCD. Between the severity of my OCD, my comorbid disorders (Bipolar 1 being the biggest comorbid barrier) and insurance difficulties  it never came to be.

For me, medication (both an SSRI and 2 atypical antipsychotics combined, amongst others)  I was finally able to decrease the severity enough to start to do a version of ERP on my own. I have some educational and past occupational experience in mental health, but am in no way qualified to properly practice ERP.

In any case, the version of ERP I did on my own, made possible in large part by medications helped tremendously. I spent a decent amount of time when a flare would lure me into 20 hr per day of OCD, and now my severity would be classified as high-mild to (more likely) low moderate. I continue on medications and do a little ERP regularly.

EatingDisorders,fcqreeq,t3_egg057,1577891022.0,"Hi. I'm happy you are recovering!

 I don't have sources handy and am not a professional. I want to let you know that there is talk out there to suggest regaining weight fairly quickly (aside from someone getting the uncommon, yet still possible Refeeding Syndrome) holds the best possibility for long term, sustained recovery. If periods have stopped (and likely even if they have not) regaining weight promptly, and thus periods if lost, likely helps osteopenia and osteporosis. Since our brains need fat and glucose to function properly, brain recovery seems to kick in once really weight restored, which is not just okay per charts, but which is *right for the individual,* is achieved. Sometimes it seems that full brain recovery can take up to a year, so generally the sooner you can be properly weight restored for *your body* the better. üòâ

Also, we need to continue to gain roughly a couple of pounds per year into our early to mid-twenties once we've finished our major growing and are at the correct weight for *you.*  This weight is partly organs finishing development. In other words, let's just say a person is 19 yo and at a weight that provides good, medically verified physical and mental health is ""xxx,"" a person will likely need to continue gaining a couple pounds for a few to several more years simply to complete development of vital organs and this likely includes completeling bone development- can't remember that part off of the top of my head, but I think that bones are also involved there.

I personally like Tabitha Farrar's podcasts, but they may or may not be something you'd like or not  based on your age. To me, she is positive and makes lots of sense. *Decoding Anorexia* by Carrie Arnold, a person recovered from AN, is a book I love too.

Supplements,fcqglpl,t3_e7f4f8,1577885616.0,"I have Bipolar 1 Disorder and O.C.D.  I would be dead if I relied solely on supplements to manage my mental health conditions. When I say dead, I literally mean dead. In *my* case I require lots of pharmaceuticals to stay afloat. This doesn't thrill me, but wait... I kind of loved the first New Year's Eve I can ever remember when I did not feel suicidal. So those pharmaceuticals are pretty damn special to me, side effects and all.  One component of the complicated cocktail I religiously adhere to  is an S.S.R.I. -even with Bipolar Disorder. This means higher doses of mood stabilizers, because it can be a bit dicey taking antidepressants with Bipolar Disorder. It's okay, though. I am not currently dying from my mental health disorders.

All that  being said, this is my personal experience and I encourage everyone to seek appropriate professional advice/treatment for signs or symotoms. I am not a professional and this is not advice.

Often, those of us with Mental Health Disorders have not so great to terrible nutrition. If one is suicidally depressed eating is not on their radar. People with Bipolar Disorder (even type 1) spend far more time in depression than mania. Evenso, in mania food is often entirely unimportant and irrelevant to the person experiencing this mood state. I have experienced feeling like I had no need to eat, eventhough I knew other people did during a manic state.  My partial solution is simply to take 1/2 of a multivitamin/mineral daily. The 1/2 dose was suggested by a physician, btw. I do take CoQ10 since I need a low dose statin due to side effects of my medicines. I only take the CoQ a few times a week, however as this is all the research bears out as needed for the dose of statins I am on. Because I truly believe it is important, after my own research, I take a daily formulation of Astaxanthin combined with a Lutein
formula. I believe in this at a personal level and see no reason not to use it. I also take probiotics and prebiotics. Again, with bad nutrition and our serotonin receptors being so plentiful in our gut, for me, probiotics make sense- think the S.S.R.I. I take. I want that S.S.R.I. to have every possible chance of efficacy at the lowest dose that helps my O.C.D. and Bipolar Depression without fueling mania.

None of the supplements are treating my disorders, but I believe they are all completely reasonable and facilitate being as healthy as possible. Those with Bipolar Disorder have a shorter lifespan than average in some case, outside of purely psychiatric causes. So, yeah a little extra help is worth the supplements I shop for frugally. I would never give up Rx meds to treat my disorders with any supplements alone. That would= *death.* This is my condition, though and others MMV. In fact, all of our mileage varies, imo.

My former careers were with lots of kids from many situations. Until you can get into the Clinical Child Psychologist, which I feel is imperative, you can check for support groups for kiddos with parents who have cancer. These are often ongoing and kids can love them! They often hold these at cancer centers or the main hospitals in the area that manage cancers. For little ones, I've known of good art ""therapy,"" play groups facilitated by trained individuals- this kind of thing. Asking your cancer treatment provider(s)/ location if they have a Child Life Specialist who can make recommendations and maybe spend some time with your daughter/family might be really good.

Getting the school fully on board with every single support there is would be high on my list!! Communicating daily with your daughter's teacher (email or log/journal back and forth between home and school and also phone calls for urgent needs) could help lots. If the school has a nurse (I know those services are limited in some places) maybe he/she could be another safe person your little girl could go to if she needs a little extra comfort. The librarian might be another option.  School secretaries are often wonderful too. ‚ò∫

It sounds as if your child is being bullied and most schools are pretty strict about not tolerating that. I'd involve the teacher and adminstration, definetely. I would not accept ineffective responses.

Is there a college age girl or mature high school girl who needs community service hours for credit? If so, this might be a great chance for your daughter to have an older friend to ""hang out"" with a few hours a week. Even if a student doesn't need credits she may be willing to spend time with your kiddo for a little money or simply because she is a caring person.

Hope one of these ideas helps at least a tiny bit. Hugs to your ""girls!"""

BipolarDisorderReddit,fcf38k0,t3_d2pbmq,1577626233.0,"Wow. A Ph.D. really worsened my disorder. A fair amount of psychodynamic therapy was utilized.  I saw him for 10 yr. Finally, enough was absolutely enough and I walked in one day, thanked him for all of the good he did do and that was it. I began getting supportive therapy from a psychiatrist (along with medication management, of course) and it makes sense to me that this is a better fit.

I know people swear by separate therapists quite often. I'm really glad they are helped. Yet imho, Bipolar Disorder being a biological brain disorder, most therapies by Ph.D. MSW's, L.C.S.W.'s mental health counselors, etc. just don't make sense *for me.*

The OP was kind of asking if a therapist can make Bipolar Disorder worse. Just my experience, reflection on the topic and my own belief is; yes, a therapist *can possibly* make a person with Bipolar Disorder worse."
BipolarDisorderReddit,fcezzgd,t3_d84ld3,1577625273.0,"I think it might depend on your age with regards to what mood stabilizer you need. Also, if you have Bipolar 1 Disorder Lamictal might not be enough. It was not for me. 

Finally, lithium became toxic, found via blood test. My kidney function looked a little weird from this for a little bit, so I had to come off of it.

I'm on atypical antipsychotics for mood stabilization now. I am fortunate that I have lost weight and not gained on them.

It might take some trial (and even error) but it sounds like you owe yourself this chance at more stability!"

BipolarDisorderReddit,fcev2ld,t3_dgxh6w,1577624003.0,"To be perfectly honest I simply can't run out or forget to take my meds. I metabolize fast and am sr*+wed if I don't take them. I keep an extra minimum of 2 days extra supply. I had to arrange to get the extra couple of days, but it's not hard since usually pharmacies will release meds a day or so before the exact due date. If you can go that route for a couple months you can have a back up supply. You might talk it over with your doctor.

As far as forgetting meds, I have known of people who put Post-Its all over as reminders, place their meds by their toothbrush for a.m. meds and make up remover for p.m. meds (if you're taking 2x per day, just as an example) and others use alarms or apps on their phone. I've heard of tons of systems. You can buy contact lens cases at Dollar Tree, which are cute and 1$ each. They will hold smaller amounts if meds, but for 1$ each you might be able to get several if you need more room.

Yes, if I should for some odd reason not take mine I feel beyond yucky too! üò∞"

I now know that a very, very slow taper would have probably been much better. As FemaleScientist17 said,  staying in contact with your psychiatrist is so important now.

I also have to wonder if the increase in Pristiq could be causing some of your symptoms. You might want to ask your doctor.

Hang in there, but be careful. xx"

At the beginning of medication for Bipolar Disorder it is pretty common for things to not be smooth. Sometimes many trials of medicine are needed before the right one or combination is found. Maybe seeing if your boyfriend would contact his psychiatrist sooner rather than later is an idea? 

Big hug!"
BipolarDisorderReddit,fcemnc6,t3_dqbjf6,1577621868.0,"Hi. I have Bipolar 1  Disorder  and OCD. A few years ago I moved from CA to WA. When I got a new, wonderful psychiatrist who specializes in mood disorders, he explained to me that Bipolar Disorder (esp. the depressed pole, it seems) is intertwined with OCD. I quickly learned that blips in my OCD are great warning signs of increasing Bipolar symptoms.

 A good percentage of Bipolar Disorder patients have comorbid O.C.D. I *do* take an S.S.R.I. I have better O.C.D. control at a higher dose, but that does trigger mania (mixed symptoms). I also need atypical antipsychotics as mood stabilizers anyway and need a higher dose in order to be able to take my S.S.R.I. Btw, Zoloft is the S.S.R.I. I tolerate best. My O.C.D. could easily be fueled by the extra energy of mania and the Bipolar Depression could make the ruminations unbearable. Quite literally, I have engaged in O.C.D. for 20hr. a day.  Working on the mood disorder via medicine has been the best strategy for me.

Just food for thought. Hope this helps, I think I kind of understand. ‚ò∫"
BipolarDisorderReddit,fceg39i,t3_e3au61,1577620125.0,"From what I know fluctuations in symptoms are more the norm than the exception. As time goes by, I'm talking years usually, the character of the disorder can change lots. There are a couple of points though; from my knowledge and my own belief about the nature of this beast, not receiving treatment can actually set the brain up for increased symptoms. Secondly, again my belief and knowledge, if you avail yourself of treatment there is the possibility the changes you experience down the road could actually be years of mild, subclinical or no really obvious signs of illness.

Hang in there!"
BipolarDisorderReddit,fcecuuw,t3_ec55hs,1577619309.0,"Yes, there is hope. Always. 

Mental illness is scary. I am what you would consider an ""older person,"" most likely. ‚ò∫ If I continue with treatment I still have lots of years left and they will be better than the first half of my life.  I will be perfectly honest: my case is unusually difficult. I take it one day at a time; sometimes I take it one second at a time.

My support system is *very* small. Mostly, it consists of an incredible psychiatrist. An super small support system has made me resourceful and stronger than I realized. It is still frightening, I have to be honest with you. The fear can be managed, though.

An idea might be to explore some of the newer treatments out there, if you haven't already. The couple I'll refer to are ketamine and Vraylar. I am on Vraylar as part of my medication cocktail and it has made a difference. (Vraylar usually needs pre-authorization or is sometimes sampled since it is <5yo +/-)

Please reach out to 911 (I'm assuming you are in the U.S. If you are elsewhere, please use whatever emergency service you have) if you are in immediate danger. 

Someone mentioned that they began taking vitamins and meds as they should. I've always been great with meds, but due to the nature of Bipolar Disorder (in many ways) my diet sucks. Getting  my psychiatrist's take on it and adding in just *1/2* of a decent multi vitamin-mineral a day also seems to help me. Can't hurt to ask your doctor. I also take an antioxidant called Astaxanthin and a good probiotic. The probiotic might help due to the recent knowledge about the ""gut microbiome"" being our ""second brain."" May sound really weird, but this is gradually becoming accepted by the mainstream.

You deserve to live a life that has meaning to you.

Hope is continually present, even when you don't feel it- it is there. I even have a tattoo to attest to this. üòâ"
Parenting,fce65jv,t3_egw2g4,1577617259.0,"I have had a niece live with me and have done foster care. If your sister has a therapist, as you seem to say, I would mention this incident to him/her. Basically, this can be an added layer of security for you both. I might ask your sister to let her therapist know first and if she can't, I might let her know that you feel it's a helpful thing for you to do for her. Safety first.

Having once been a 15yo girl, I can express that we sometimes just want an affirmation that we're normal and attractive. Taking pictures seems a way to get that affirmation. Also, I'm sure you already do this, but making sure she gets lots of feedback from you about her strengths other than her appearance. Giving compliments about her looks from time to time is good too, if done well. For ex: "" Rebecca, I really like the way you did your hair today,"" or ""Wow, you are so great at styling your thrift store finds! I wish I could style like that. You look very nice.""
Just my opinions from the 15yo girl  I once was and from my past experience with kiddos. ‚ò∫

My concern would be that down the road she might act on teenage impulse and send the photos. Thus, giving the therapist the information could be vital in helping your sister avoid this and both of you avoiding a whole bunch of drama neither of you need.

You seem like a super caring adult in her life. That will go a very long way, from what I have experienced."

To augment what I can afford, which is not a lot and not super healthy, I found a decent quality multi-vitamin/mineral (generic Centrum). I actually bought a pill splitter and take a half per day. It might be useful for others too, yet obviously can not fully replace veggies, protein and more."

Frugal,fcdn4ra,t1_fcachdm,1577611563.0,"Huh, I am scraping buy on dollar store finds. My tricks are buying the Panasonic batteries and I actually love some of the lipsticks! I am careful about eyeliner, as I found one I was slightly (and very slightly) sensitive too. It was a name brand and could have been purchased anywhere. I buy cotton rounds and Witch Hazel as a great facial toner here.

OTC meds are great at dollar stores (Dollar Tree,specifically). I need to give myself injections into a muscle fairly regularly. (Yeah, freaks some people out, but gotta' do what you gotta' do ‚ò∫) I buy Curad guaze pads, bandaids and alcohol wipes for this- they last a long time due to quantity. First aid products in general are good deals where I am. Hand sanitizer can often be found in brand name form in both standard sizes and the small, purse sized varieties.

As for food, there are canned sardines and tuna, which are protein-packed and generally healthy. The prices of these particular products are good, imho.  I would encourage using tuna somewhat infrequently due to potential mercury issues. I know the mercury thing is controversial and some people think it is overstated. I limit tuna to once per week, while I have relatives who insist once a month is all we should have.

Some snack items are great deals at Dollar Tree, also. For ex: there are PennyStick (something like this!) pretzels that are awesome. Also, veggie chips are often there, as well as regular chips. Tortilla chips are typically a non-standard, too small rip off. Things like soda, milk, (usually) frozen dinners are not the best deal imho.

Cards at Dollar Tree can be 2 for 1$ if you buy Hallmark's Heartline brand. They're actually nice.

Another couple good items are ""cozy socks."" These are great for around home, but also for boots that are just a little on the big side. Super comfy. Gloves this time of year are a good deal too.

The other trick I use is to plan ahead and block out a little over 1 hr. to make good decisions and really scour the place for what you need.

Happy Finds!"
