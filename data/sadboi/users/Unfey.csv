witchcraft,fr3ouus,t1_fr3lt1u,1589862357.0,"Voodoo is closed, Native American spiritualities are usually either closed or very restricted. Indigenous religions tend to be closed in general. You can find more through research and googling.

In the US at least, some other modern religions practiced by immigrant populations, like Hinduism, can be controversial for people outside that community to ""dabble"" in. The reason for this is that, while these faiths may have huge numbers of practitioners in other countries, here in North America that faith belongs to a marginalized and often oppressed immigrant population. You can imagine how that can be contentious within the witchcraft community, new age community, and even among immigrant communities being discussed. Issues of cultural appropriation, questions about people's responsibility to local minority communities as opposed to massive foreign communities, all sorts of questions about whether spiritualities can/do belong to specific communities, and just a whole lot of other issues come up during discussions of this kind of controversy. That's why I say that it gets messy."

witchcraft,fr3mu3t,t3_gmcqoz,1589860943.0,"Witchcraft does not involve demons or satanism. Unless you want it to. 

Some of us are Christians, some are Jewish, Muslim, Wiccan, Buddhist, Atheist, Pagan, Vodun-- and yes, some are Satanists. Any religion you can think of. You can practice witchcraft no matter where you come from, no matter what you believe in. 

Witchcraft is not evil. It can be used to do bad things, or good things. There are many different ways you can practice Witchcraft. You can use only your own willpower, your own energy, or your higher consciousness. You could call on your guardian angels or saints to help you. You could call on gods and goddesses, natural elements, fairies, or spirits. You could call on ancestors or the dead. You could, if you wanted, call on demons. We're all very different in this community, with different beliefs and different ways. 

If you're nervous or apprehensive, you shouldn't start practicing witchcraft. Educate yourself first. It's good that you're asking questions. Keep learning, keep asking questions, and don't jump into it too quickly-- you should never do something you're uncomfortable with."

witchcraft,fr3kpoe,t3_gmge0a,1589859531.0,"While this does get complicated when it comes to closed practices and oppressed people's religions, the short answer is that it's fine to seek out deities from various world traditions. Particularly ""dead"" mythologies, like Norse, Greek, Ancient Egyptian, Celtic, and similar ancient faiths. 

It's messier when it comes to modern faiths with living cultural practitioners, and there's pretty wide variation from faith to faith in opinions about outsiders trying to worship their gods. It's always important to be as educated as possible about the cultures you're engaging with, and that's most crucial when you're dealing with living cultures.

You should be fine with Aphrodite. She's been revered by many cultures under many names in the Old World. It seems fairly clear from history that the Ancient Greeks liked seeing their pantheon revered outside their domain, so I don't think anyone should have an issue with this. I don't see why they would."
witchcraft,fqtyz79,t3_gkx0ws,1589648807.0,"Be skeptical.

Witchcraft communities, books, sites, etc., are quite honestly full of bullshit sometimes. You need to be educated about your sources, their history, and the history of the things you believe in. And be aware of witchcraft practices that you think are bullshit. Some witches may have firmly-held beliefs in things that seem silly to you, some witches may have long-standing practices that you can thoroughly and easily debunk. These witches have a place in our community-- we are diverse and welcoming and curious about things we don't practice ourselves-- but it's important for each of us to draw our personal lines about what we do and do not trust, what we do and do not believe, what we can and cannot accept.

Be aware, be educated, and question everything you're doing. Know *why* you're doing what you're doing. *Understand* your practice. That's what distinguishes witchcraft from religions such as christianity, or those people who are merely new-agey. 

Also, research the origins of secularism. Our cultural beliefs that deities, spirits, and angels are ""mythical"" are grounded in a version of secularism that derives heavily from Christianity and Christian imperialism. Our cultural understanding of what is ""reality"" and what is possible comes from Christian understandings of the physical world and God's place in it, and our cultural atheism is a reaction to this specific Christian vision, making our cultural secularism and its dedication to sciences of what can be measured, tested, and proven (as opposed to faith in miracles) a part of a long conversation within Christian culture. 

So be skeptical of everything-- your understanding of reality, your preconcieved notions of secular truth, your beliefs, the beliefs of others, the people giving you advice, the practices you do. Move forward through the skepticism. Try things that challenge your beliefs. Be skeptical of yourself and what you know, and be willing to educate yourself."

Other ppl have better ideas than I do about how to curse, but just remember this-- you'll probably feel bad about doing it afterwards, because that's how negative energy works (even when its righteous or just). Remind yourself that even though you're calling pain upon someone else, even though you're doing something bad to someone, you still deserve healing and require protection during/after the process. So treat yourself afterwards and focus your energy into cleansing, healing, and protecting your body, mind, and spirit for awhile. Eat your favorite foods and spend time with nature.

witchcraft,fqkamex,t3_gjahnr,1589423390.0,"I made all of mind. My first one was a branch of lilac wood. I de-barked it, soaked it in chamomile tea for a night, and decorated it with a string of beads and a scrap of my favorite dress that got ripped. It broke when I was in college, so I made a new one, also lilac wood-- this one I charged in moon water and attached amethysts to with epoxy. At the same time, I made a spruce wand the same way, in moon water. I put clear quartz beads around this one, and decorated it by lacing black thread all over it.

The lilac branches came from bushes by my house. I cut the first myself, the second time they were being pruned. The spruce wand was made from a huge old tree outside my house that my dad cut down because he thought it looked sick and ugly (haven't forgiven him). My mom and I were so sad when they were cutting it down, because it felt like losing a friend-- the tree had been there all twenty years we lived here. I saved a branch, cutting it into pieces to use for wands and woodworking. It helped to be able to use part of the tree. 

The lilac wands have been good for ceremonial purposes, divination, energy work, and lighter magic. The spruce wand has been my go-to for cleaning, protecting, and heavier magic."
witchcraft,fqk8ubi,t3_gipzfr,1589422387.0,"What we consider ""witchcraft"" is derived from folk practices which predate Christianity, and which were forced underground by Christian invaders, enslavers, and colonizers. European pagans, indigenous american religions, and african traditions have this history in common, which is why these practices are frequently brought into modern witchcraft practices.

Of course, witchcraft can be whatever you make it. I don't know much about Chinese history, but I'm fairly certain that Chinese folk practices were never forced underground by Christians who believed it was demon worship. Some of what is considered ""occult"" in the US is merely Asian spiritualities. Qi gong, meditation, feng shui, forms of astrology, divination-- a bunch of these things exist in Asian cultures or originated there. Western New Age culture has appropriated many spiritual traditions from Asian countries, incorporating practices from Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism. 

Determining what is and isn't ""witchcraft"" is a matter of perspective. It can be tricky sometimes, navigating the weird cultural field of modern witchcraft when you're non-white, since a lot of New Age culture is just straight-up cultural appropriation and white people patting themselves on the back for being 'open-minded' acting like they own other people's spiritual practices. I'm Native American and it's always super weird seeing my tribe's cultural practices-- sage smudging, spirit animals, totems, a bunch of other stuff-- labelled ""witchcraft."" Because the Native people I know who go to ceremonies and participate in medicine society and stuff would never consider themselves ""witches"" or consider their culture ""witchcraft"" or even witch-adjacent. 

I'll make some assumptions here and wager that your older relatives probably wouldn't consider their practices ""witchcraft"" either. However, again, what is and isn't ""witchcraft"" is up to you-- the practitioner.

As a witch, I do incorporate indigenous practices from my culture into my craft. I know that my relatives and ancestors wouldn't consider indigenous practices to be witchcraft at all. But for me-- as an American who grew up mostly around white Christians-- that stuff isn't really accepted or embraced by christian or secular western society. Western secularism deems it superstition-- kooky at best, delusional at worst-- and western christianity deems it demonic, or at the very least heathen. So, for me, our indigenous practices and my witchcraft kind of go hand-in-hand. They're not the same, but I'm part of both, and both are part of me, in the same breath, at the same time.

That's just my personal experience of it. It's pretty weird being in the witchcraft community as a non-white person sometimes, but you make it work."

witchcraft,fpmeb38,t3_ge5vx4,1588731201.0,"Take something from the house, anything really, a nail or a key or a piece of decor you saw often. A piece of furniture, even. You can't carry the house with you. Saying goodbye to a house is really hard, almost as hard as saying goodbye to a person. It's worst of all when you have to say goodbye to both at once. I still dream about my grandma's house. It's hard to think about it with someone else in it, someone else's decorations, someone else's paint and carpeting. My grandpa built it himself and every pipe in the walls felt special, every archway and linoleum tile. He died when I was a year old, so the house he built was all I knew of him. When she died and the house got sold, I sort of felt like I lost both of them. 

Now when I drive by, there's a christmas tree in the living room or somebody's tall shadow moving around the kitchen or a kid's bike in the yard-- signs that someone new has made that place their home. Sometimes it makes me mad to think that they couldn't possibly love the house like I did. It's not their grandpa's house. But he's gone, and she's gone, and the time I spent there is passed. 

A few years ago, an extremely old lady came to my house with her daughter. She said she lived here when she was a girl, and that her dad built my house. We gave her the tour. She seemed... sad, maybe? Interested to see what had changed, nostalgic for familiar things, maybe disappointed to find that less was the same than she'd imagined. In the nineties, the people before us added two new rooms, and then when we moved in we built a porch. The house was twice its original size when the lady visited. She said that her parents slept in my room. Or, I guess, I slept in their room. She said they never had fires in the fireplace-- we use it all the time. 

I don't know if visiting our house-- her house-- made her feel better. Sometimes I think about asking to visit my grandma's old house, just to look inside and see how things have changed so that I can stop imagining it the way it used to be, and stop dreaming about dust settling on her belongings without someone to take care of them. But I don't know.

I have some pieces of her house. The basket of fake fruit, the gumball machine my grandpa made from a mason jar that sat in her kitchen. When I see those things, I can feel like I'm back in the house again. Or at least like I've taken some piece of the past with me.

But I don't know if it's good to haunt a house. I'm not sure you can avoid it. When you love a place, part of you can't ever say goodbye. Part of you stays there. I don't know if you can take a place with you, but you can certainly leave part of yourself behind. The part that dreams will return again and again. 

I wish that places, like people, could pass away. So that goodbye could be goodbye. But that's not how it is, so I guess we just have to find a way to be content with moving on, and accepting the grief we feel for those places we can't return to. Sorry if this didn't help. I hope you're doing well."

You said you didn't bleed, maybe that's why-- you can't scratch deep.

The fact that this is manifesting in puberty makes me think that it's probably a medical issue rather than a magical one. Something to ask your doctor about.

If you want to be extra cautious, burn some lavender, juniper, or rosemary in your room and sprinkle salt in a ring around your bed. Take a cleansing bath with a generous amount of epsom salt. Add lavender oil or tea if you have it. The salt is the main thing, though. Salt repels bad spirits. You need to keep your focus on sending bad energy away during the bath.

The very best way to start out with moon magic is to just spend some time outside under the full moonlight. Either stand or sit and feel the moonlight on your body, try to sense its energy, and maybe meditate a little. Outside in direct moonlight is best, but if that's not realistic for you, you can light a white candle to symbolize the moon's energy and just sit there, consciously paying attention to the power of the moon.

  
You can use the full moon to make moon water, but it won't be very useful to you until you learn to get in touch with lunar energy. Moon water carries the energy of the moon it was infused beneath, and as with all things in witchcraft that energy is up to you to channel-- moon water in and of itself won't have special powers unless you can work with the moonlight energy. 

So to start off, I recommend doing a full moon meditation. It's a great way to get a feel of the full moon's power, and gently attune yourself to the lunar energies."

However, if you're searching for a sign from a deity, and you've put that intention into the world, deities who want to work with you might send you signs.

If you feel like the bee is a sign, she might be-- it's also possible it was just a bee that got in your house, though. Signs from the gods are few and far between.

If you choose to believe that this was a sign, here are some deities who might be contacting you:

Demeter (seems like the obvious choice to me, as a prominent nature goddess)

Gaia (another obvious choice, goddess of all the earth)

Brigid (held bees as sacred, bees bring nectar from her otherworld orchard)

Cybele (another earth goddess, sometimes conflated with titanness Rhea)

Ra (created bees through shedding tears)

Freya (her tears are golden bees)

Aristaeus (god of bee-keeping)

Kore/Persephone (through her association with Potina, an unnamed ""pure mother bee"" deity of minoan/mycenean mythology, also a goddess of spring and the underworld, and bees are considered the bridge between this world and the underworld)

Ah-Muzen-Cab (Mayan god of bees)

Austeja (Lithuanian goddess of bees)

Bhramari (Hindu goddess of bees, a form of Shakti who fights demons)

Colel Cab (Mayan goddess of bees)

Melissa/Mellona (Greek/Roman goddess of honey)

The Thriae (greek nymphs, patrons of bees, associated with divination)

Some other deities with bee associations: 

Aphrodite, Vishnu, Pan, Artemis

witchcraft,fowshqc,t3_g9j8ty,1588126193.0,"I hate it. 

I don't volunteer my opinion without being asked, since I think that people should be able to call themselves whatever they want. If beginners like the term, that's good for them. I'm not in charge of what you do.

I try to avoid any post whose op describes themselves as a ""baby witch."" I have a lot of different reasons to hate the term. 

First, I don't like seeing people-- especially women and young girls-- diminish their own power and authority right off the bat. I used to help people workshop cover letters, and the #1 most annoying problem I always saw was when people depreciated their own agency. For example: ""This experience helped teach me some leadership skills"" vs ""I took a leadership role."" The culprits were usually young women, though not always. The point is that self-depreciation is not a good look on somebody searching for acceptance, guidance, and help. 

""Baby"" evokes helplessness. A baby needs to be nourished, hand-held, provided for, and treated delicately. A baby can't ask questions, doesn't know right from wrong, isn't responsible for their own actions. If you're on a witchcraft path, you are taking agency. You have to embrace your agency. You already *know* you must ask questions, you *know* right and wrong, you *know* you are responsible for everything you do-- that's part of the power of witchcraft. You can't be a baby and a witch. Being a witch means making conscious choices and accepting full responsibility for the consequences. 

""Baby"" also evokes a sort of cloying cutesyness, like the poster wants us to see them as something adorable-- like a baby fox or kitten. Like they're trying to make up for their perceived flaws-- lack of self-confidence and lack of experience-- with ""look at me, I'm baby!"" Like that'll make us like them more, or handle them with kid gloves. 

Finally, I don't like some of the current trends in online witchcraft culture that has led to the widespread use of the term ""baby witch."" Witchcraft is becoming more popular through social media through types of media which glorify very shallow, aesthetic aspects of the craft. It's good that younger generations are coming into the craft. However, these new waves of witches arrive via cults of personality and fashionable trends and a lot of channels which assert blatant misinformation. When I came into the craft-- and listen, I'm not like, old or anything, I'm 25 so I'm not harping on youngins these days-- I believed that the craft was about wisdom and power and personal discovery. I still believe that-- and I don't believe that approaching the craft by trying to emulate any kind of *trend* is great for new witches or the witch community.

So that's why the term ""Baby Witch"" annoys me and rubs me the wrong way."

witchcraft,fog52um,t3_g7b5yi,1587747998.0,"Depends on the kind of witchcraft. Modern mainstream witchcraft-- which draws a lot of its practices/philosophy from wicca-- doesn't really include animal sacrifice in its practices, and doesn't have precedents and guidelines in place for performing it. Wiccans are generally against harming animals in any way. This philosophy bleeds into much mainstream witchcraft. I'd expect that most modern people are against ritual animal sacrifice.

I'd advise against animal sacrifice outside the context of a tradition which actually has precedent and guidelines for it. There are forms of witchcraft which do have traditional space for animal sacrifice in their practice, and if you're knowledgeable in one of these forms and have instruction, that's one thing. But if you're just guessing about it, if you're hoping that killing a chicken might add some kind of ""oomph"" to a spell but you're not sure how/why/if it works, don't do it."

witchcraft,foegxe7,t3_g6zicz,1587703497.0,"Aphrodite is amazing. She can be overwhelming, but in a good way. Her presence feels like falling in love. 

If she's vain, she's right to be. She's beauty itself. She's not weak, and she's not ill-tempered. Her energy is very kind and bright.

She's presented in various ways in different stories. She comes off better in some tales than in others. All of the Greek deities are pretty melodramatic characters in mythology, Aphrodite no more or less than average.

She is a *very* feminine Goddess with high-femme energy, and negative stereotypes about highly feminine women are part of her character in mythology-- she's portrayed as gossipy, weak-willed, adulterous, vain, etc. You can see her that way if you want. You can see femininity that way if you want, too. Or you can see her as a feminine character who knows exactly what she wants and who she is, fully confident and awake in her sexuality, unashamed, with high regard for herself and high expectations for how others treat her.

Aphrodite is an excellent goddess to work with. In modern times, she's as much a goddess of self love as of romantic love, particularly in an era when we're short on the former. She teaches us to follow our hearts and chase our pleasure, and shows us how to fall in love with little things in our world every day."

witchcraft,fo3mr17,t3_g5c7t9,1587489497.0,"Not abnormal at all! Pretty run-of-the-mill, actually. Witchcraft goes way beyond the aesthetic you see online and in media. Lots of people have online grimoires. I can't keep plants alive either. 

""Knowing if something is going to work or not"" IS feeling energies. That's called intuition, and you have it. Everyone experiences it differently. I'm a high-visualization type of witch, you sound like you're more intuitive. Both ways work and are pretty common.

Oracle cards and tarot cards are meant to draw upon YOUR intuition, not be restricted to the artist's interpretation. It's very normal to interpret card drawings differently than what the books say. It's actually better; that means your intuition is working, and you can rely on your intuition a lot more than some writer's suggestions. 

Lots of people feel drawn to different elements or forces of nature. A lot of witches make use predominantly of earthy aesthetics and magic, but others are more into astrology and the night sky, and some are storm witches or sea witches, some (like me) are drawn to fire magic, but it's much more common for witches to use all different kinds of magic and work with all the different elements. It's fine to have preferences, to resonate more with particular aspects of nature. That's just what you're ""good"" at right now, and you can choose to hone that or you can experiment outside your comfort zone. Either choice is fine.

Dogs are good familiars. Hekate, my patron goddess, walks with many hounds. I have a cat and I love her but she's not a familiar-- she's got no interest in witchcraft and she's kind of a goofy idiot. My dog, on the other hand, likes to observe and keep watch whenever I do spellwork.

witchcraft,fo1orkf,t1_fo1m0kb,1587437999.0,"Yeah that's creepy. Seeing as there's a knot, my go-to instinct would be to untie it. If you're worried about curses, I mean. 

Let's assume for a moment that this *is* a curse-- most likely, the culprit bound some ill intent into this knot and planted it on your property, hoping that ill intent would spread and manifest to someone in your home. 

This means that (a) there is someone out there who wants you to get hurt, (b) they know where you live and (c) they're willing to kill an animal and go to what seems like a lot of effort to turn it into a hex object. None of that is good news. 

I think it's a good idea to alert law enforcement, if that's a possibility for you. Curse or no curse, it seems like someone is either trying to hurt or scare you (or your family). 

One possible benefit to untying the knot is to see if there's anything inside-- any herb, or scrap of paper with something written, or any other kind of object that could point to this person's motive or exact intentions. That might help you figure out whether this is someone you know, someone with an agenda, maybe-- or whether it's just a random act.

Alternatively, this could be a sloppy disposal of spell items-- some teen sociopath playing witch doctor, perhaps, tossing his garbage someplace random to freak people out. That's not great, either, but it's better than being targeted personally.

The worst possibility is that it's not a curse at all, but a threat. I'm really not sure what kind of threat this would be, but there might be a very unhinged person out there who thinks *you* will understand what they mean. 

Maybe getting some home security cameras-- or even fake ones-- might be a good plan. It might also be a good idea to talk to police about it.

You might find that she appreciates your spending time in graveyards, leaving small offerings for spirits there. Based on what I've heard, Hekate mostly encourages her witches to live their best lives and face their own inner miasma head-on, learn through trial and error, and to respect the dark and challenging aspects of nature.

Be good to spirits, be good to people, do justice, explore the dark and mysterious, and face your fears. That's all Hekate generally asks.

pagan,fnq4ijz,t3_g37b94,1587157528.0,"I'm ""sciency"" and I don't have trouble reconciling science with my religious practices. I believe in science and the scientific method, and I believe that everything that happens in the physical world has a physical explanation.

However, I also believe that the physical world is not the only world we inhabit. I believe there are forces and entities outside of the physical, which we cannot measure. Some things which happen-- hauntings, possessions, contact with the divine, magic and miracles, etc-- are easily explainable with science, and simultaneously explainable through spirituality, and we don't have to choose because both explanations can be valid at once.

Personally, I think that it's kind of silly for any of us to hold any kind of certainty that we know for sure what is or isn't out there, considering how little we know about the *physical* universe, let alone worlds outside. So I'm a skeptic, but I'm also superstitious. I'm cautious and suspicious of anything people claim to be supernatural, but I'm willing to engage in the occult-- not to attempt to prove or disprove magic, but rather merely in good faith that such things are real. I practice spirituality because I think it humbles me, opening myself up to the notion that I cannot truly comprehend the whole universe, and I think it's important to be humble in this day and age.

It's difficult, especially in our culture, to reconcile spiritual logic with mundane logic, particularly for those of us who place a lot of value on scientific thought and secular philosophy. Even so, I think that it can do the mind and the spirit a lot of good to concede-- even if only every once in awhile-- that thousands of years of human spirituality and folklore could be valuable and real, that the universe is much more enormous and complex than we can measure, that we DON'T understand all we think we do, and that our individual human experiences are not all-encompassing. It feels good to accept these things, to entertain ideas of magic and deities, to humble oneself, to connect with our human origins and ancestral practices. 

That's my take on it, personally. I hope this helps."

This was an urban fantasy LARP at my college. It was ongoing, kind of like Assassin, where you could challenge someone else to a dice battle at any time. The bad player-- who played a werewolf-- was the GM's girlfriend at the time and he let her bend the rules so that her character was INCREDIBLY OP. My friends and I (all girls, she hated us) formed an alliance for protection. Our stats worked in conjunction so even though we were weak individually, we were a powerhouse as a group.

We met for a session one night when it was a full moon, and Werewolf's powers were at max. She was essentially unkillable, and she'd disgruntled a lot of other players by killing their characters left and right. She was also DRESSED like a werewolf. It was clear she was having a lot of fun, while everyone else was pissed off because she one-shotted everyone so easily and her GM boyfriend took her side constantly.

When she dueled my friends and I, though, she couldn't beat us. Because as a group, we could exploit some loopholes in the game that allowed us to take 0 damage while also slowly chipping away at her hp. If she'd left us alone she would have been fine, but she was so pissed off that she kept fighting us. I won't deny that I was smug as hell. I legit couldn't stand this bitch and I was happy to see her get so enraged at not getting what she wanted.

Anyways then she stormed straight at me and raised her fist to punch me IRL.
