Anxiety,fgo0pon,t3_eyv4nd,1580957116.0,Congrats. I've been struggling lately with my anxiety and BPD. I finally bit the bullet to make an appointment for rehab tomorrow which will be my first time and I'm pretty scared but I don't want to put my life on pause anymore like you said in a previous post. All the best <3
