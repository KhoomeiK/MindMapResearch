I also experience this, and this article really helped put somethings into perspective for me (second header down). I could be wrong, but I think it may be a mixed episode, as it sounds similar to mine! My hypomania is always high anxiety, stress, and the compulsion to do ""something"" (with some other symptoms of course). 

When I am calm and not doing much I feel it the most, so you may just be more aware of it when trying to relax?

Wishing you the best!"

I had a very similar situation at 13 and ended up running away with my middle school boyfriend 4x. I was a mess. By the time I was 14 I was having similar revelations and tried to kill myself. It ended up with me going to therapy and I recovered a considerable about.

Maybe practice trying to see others auras to see if there is a difference?
