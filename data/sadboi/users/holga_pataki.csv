AskWomenOver30,fi1ihcn,t3_f5n446,1582058415.0,"I hope no one takes this the wrong way but please don’t conflate “introverted” and “socially awkward.” Introversion has nothing to do with social awkwardness, or for that matter, sociability or warmth in interactions. 
I see a lot of people nowadays using “introverted” as a stand-in for “antisocial” or “never leaves the house” or “doesn’t want to talk to people” and it’s just super stereotypical and inaccurate. I think there’s a lot of internet pop culture comics and meme type stuff that’s like “introverts hide in bed under blankets with their cat and order food online and never go out!” 
All introversion signifies is that some people are energized by alone time and quietude. It doesn’t mean they’re cold, reserved, awkward, or even “quiet.” I am often mistaken for an extrovert because I’m very warm and friendly; but I can only take a little bit of big-group socializing before I get exhausted and have to recharge.
My male partner is also an introvert and I’ve never met a man with such lovely social skills before in my life. 
You’re probably meeting introvert men over 40 every day and you don’t even realize it. They exist in the wild!!"

It’s all about empowering yourself to curate the online experience you want to have. If the influencers can curate their online lives as they do, we also have the power to curate them out of our line of sight if we find ourselves in self-hatred spirals from seeing their posts!

If that means unfollowing, muting, or hiding people, so be it. Comparison is the thief of joy. We already receive enough of the “not good enough” messaging. You’re allowed to not engage on social media with stuff that you don’t want to see, for any reason, period end."

Things like poor communication, any kind of cheating, disrespect, a partner being controlling/overbearing (a very common abuse red flag), etc. are all extremely normal reasons to leave a relationship. If you’re being treated badly and have tried to communicate about the other person’s behavior, and they don’t change, well... it’s not your responsibility to make them a better person. Some people are going to be inconsiderate jerks, and it’s not “picky” of you to refuse to do the emotional labor of being in a relationship with them.”

It’s not like you have superficial “high standards” like “he must be 6’2”, drive a BMW, make 150k a year, have a dog, love the same sports teams I do...” etc. What you’re asking for is basic, basic stuff: to be treated like a human being, for the other person to be mature and put in the same amount of effort you do, to contribute positively to the relationship.

You don’t have to choose between a relationship and respect. You can have both. It just takes the right person. Don’t settle until you find them."

Don’t put any on the roots/close to your scalp, just like... finger comb it through the length of your hair. Then you can blow dry it or air dry it!

I have had a similar experience with getting out of a long term relationship in which my partner acted like I didn’t exist/everything about me was wrong and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Here’s my survival tips: 
- It may sound cliche but “date yourself.” Treat yourself special. Everything you do, do it for yourself. Cherish your damn self! Now is the time to do that! Take as much time as you need to Do You without worrying about someone else.
- When you’re ready for a partner, you’ll know. You’ve spent 9 years prioritizing someone who wasn’t prioritizing you, and those patterns of self-giving can be well worn and hard to break, so it seems easy to be in the “gotta find a relationship” mindset. I did the same thing. But until you’ve healed from this one, anything else is gonna be a non-starter.
- Do some journaling, soul-searching, or whatever to get clear on what you want out of future relationships and what kind of partner you want. What are the qualities that person would ideally have? What kind of boundaries will you have around dating, relationships, your own autonomy? What are your values?
- I don’t know a single person who gets  a full Brazilian wax so screw that noise. All joking aside, you own your body and it isn’t your job to try to keep up with what the culture teaches (shallow, uninformed) men to expect from women. Make your own decisions about hair removal, personal style, whatever. You do not need to cater to some Male Gaze Fantasy.
- Accept nothing less than being treated like a person, and look at men the same way: they’re just people. You’re a person; they’re people. 
- You GOT this and I am rooting for you. I wish you all the good things!"

“You’re not afraid to BE YOURSELF!”
“You know who you are, you don’t need to cling to fads or trends to find out!”

I was ten thousand percent not competitive, and “who I was” was constructed entirely to please them, so I wouldn’t get shamed, hit, or yelled at.

“Who I am” is introverted, sensitive, and creative. Whenever I tried to express those things, I was mocked, or told I was “never going to be anybody.” Anytime I tried to spend any time alone, they made fun of me. “HAHAHAH are you going to go BROOD IN YOUR ROOM like a MOOOOODY TEEEEEEN?!”

Also like I said, feelings are NOT facts. But that doesn’t make them any less real for the person experiencing them. They don’t have to be factually true to be valid. There is a difference between correct and real.
Someone telling me I’m wrong isn’t gonna help me feel any better in moments of distress. There is a difference between telling someone “hey like, those are very real irrational feelings, let’s acknowledge them” and “well I’m gonna argue you down to prove you’re wrong and once you realize you’re wrong you won’t feel bad anymore.”

You’re right- people with BDD don’t see themselves accurately. I know this to be factually true, yet I still see myself the way I see myself. Knowing logically that my perception is inaccurate doesn’t change it or correct it. I still see what I see and feel what I feel, and I know it’s disordered thinking; but that’s how I see myself.

AskWomenOver30,fekww3p,t3_epknt8,1579209280.0,"I’m a bioinformatics IT data analyst Monday through Friday 9-5 and musician/photographer the rest of the time, and I have a lot of feelings about this. 

I’ve worked some jobs in this field that I thought were stifling, and some that weren’t. The difference between them, for me, was the level of autonomy I had, and the expectations of the workplace. 

When I had a high degree of autonomy and could “leave work at work” at the end of the day, I didn’t feel stifled at all. I would go in, do my thing, then go home and make my art and let my hair down and it was fine.

When I was micromanaged, had little control over the flow of my day, and was expected to stay as long as it took to get everything done all the time (as if nothing could wait until the next day), that’s when I felt stifled. I felt like I couldn’t have a band practice or show on a weeknight, EVER, because who knows what time I have to stay at work until? I’d go into the office in the morning and be like “I have no idea when I’ll be able to leave.” And when I had people over my shoulder dictating my every move, I was far too mentally and emotionally exhausted to create anything of value.

The long and the short of it is, I’ve been doing the tech job/creative life thing for a while; I’ve gotten used to the separation of the two. I would not want to rely on my art for income. I don’t think I’d be able to take creative risks and be true to myself if I were selling my art on the free market. I would have to make commercial art for a commercial purpose. It’s freeing to not have to do that. As long as my job gives me money to live and make the most of my free time, I’m for it.

1. The music scene in my city/my friends who are also in bands and part of the community 
2. Animal welfare and the environment, sustainability 
3. My houseplants- I have many and I love them so much.

This made me cry, y’all. Happy tears. Thank you."
AskWomenOver30,fegj5vo,t3_eoxbqm,1579094387.0,"I haven’t actually quit a job without something else already lined up, but I had a job that was so awful that I gave myself a quitting deadline (my birthday that year) if I hadn’t moved on by then. Luckily I found something before my birthday and was able to get out of that clusterheck.

I’ve moved on from multiple jobs that were toxic environments. A lot of workplaces are garbage, emotionally abusive hellholes. Having had this experience, I advise you to get the hell out of that place as soon as you can. Post your resume on a few sites, update your LinkedIn, send out applications on your lunch break.

Your family isn’t you. They’re not the ones experiencing this stress and spending every day unhappy and distraught. They don’t feel how bad this is acutely every day like you do. They do not know best. You know you and it’s your life. Your time is precious and finite. Do not waste it in misery."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fedswtd,t3_eoe7d5,1579019196.0,"A couple years ago I did a DBT-based partial hospitalization program and they taught us all sorts of stuff for mindfulness and emotion regulation. These are the ones I found most helpful:
1. Carry an essential oil with you that has a calming scent- a lot of people like lavender or peppermint.
2. If you feel like you’re about to panic, splash your face with cold water (look up dive response and anxiety to learn more).
3. Use the 5 Senses- name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can hear, 3 things you can feel, 2 things you can smell, 1 thing you can taste. This is a grounding exercise that brings you back to the present moment and the world around you.
4. Progressive muscle relaxation - look this up too! It works for me when I’m awake in the night with anxiety and I can’t get back to sleep.
5. Like the previous commenter said, box breathing is great!
I highly recommend looking into some DBT worksheets. There are tons of free ones on the Internet. I did my partial program over a year ago and I still pull out those DBT sheets when I’m feeling like I’m in a bad place. I wish you the best- this is a tough and stressful time for you for sure but I believe you can get through it!"
AskWomenOver30,feacp7x,t3_eo0gdl,1578947073.0,"This has happened twice in my life:
The first one: I had a friend in high school who I had sort of a silent falling out with. She was a good friend for a while but then things got weird and tense. I had a strange, emotionally abusive upbringing and complex trauma and I was certainly not aware of it or good at dealing with it as a teen, so that was certainly a factor. She transferred schools when we were like 15 and we didn’t speak for a couple years. Then freshman year of college she got back in touch and we have been tight ever since. I’m so happy that happened and our friendship is rock solid.
The second one: my ex-roommate and ex-bandmate was a great friend for a while but she had a lot of issues. Very little compassion/empathy, horrible at feelings in general, did a lot of fat shaming and body shaming, was manipulative and mean and cruel and hypocritical. I decided I didn’t want to work with her creatively anymore cause it was causing me a great deal of stress, and when that happened she saw no use in being friends with me. We haven’t spoken in years. A mutual friend of ours had something pretty horrible happen in his life recently and apparently she heard about it and reached out to me on FB Messenger, which I never check. I came across the message weeks after it was sent and decided to just not click it. I don’t want to open the door to having a toxic person like that in my life."
IBSHelp,fea9beb,t3_eo242i,1578945891.0,Sometimes it’s pretty immediate. Like within an hour or so. Sometimes it’s immediate and then the symptoms continue for an additional 12-ish hours after I eat the trigger food.
houseplants,fe2t7wn,t1_fdut9r0,1578842596.0,Heck yes- thank you! This is a great resource!
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdrbx1p,t1_fdqe6yh,1578682308.0,"I understand this unfairness in attitude so deeply- I was in a long term relationship through my 20s, and during that time, there was so much shade thrown at us about not being married. My ex’s mother even said (more like drunkenly slurred) to me once, “you’re not a wife, you’re just a GIIIIRLFRIEEEEEND” and told him on the phone “if you don’t marry her, she’s going to leave you.” No one in our families ever knew how to treat us- they had this hang up that we weren’t married so there was this bizarre distance, but we had been together too long to not treat each other like a member of the family, so it was basically awkward and weird for 9 years or so. (Anyway he ended up being a serial cheater and liar after all so I’m retroactively glad we didn’t get married cause that would have made it a lot worse.) But I always felt that sting of “no one respects or understands our relationship because we didn’t sign a piece of paper.” I guess I stand on the side of “as long as both people in the relationship are happy and living the way they want to live, screw the haters.” But it isn’t always easy- family and society can be very influential."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdnqlas,t3_eit0v6,1578590946.0,"At least where I’m from, it’s the law to allow employees to take a 30 minute lunch break if your workday is 8 hours. If they tell you you’re not allowed to take a lunch break, that’s a labor law violation. Not sure if that’s the case where you are, but it may be a good idea to look into the labor laws regarding breaks. 
I would casually bring this up in conversation with your direct manager- during onboarding when they get you situated, you can casually ask “hey what’s normal for this team in terms of start time/what time do people usually head out for the day?” Then your manager can tell you what the norm is for others in the group. Odds are, there will be some variation/flexibility/autonomy in start/end times. 
That’s definitely a more friendly conversation than “I will be leaving at the stroke of 5 each day and not a minute later.” 
It’s really about the company culture (and industry culture more broadly) - but there is no harm in asking what the expectations are in a friendly, exploratory way. I’ve started asking those types of questions in interviews and hiring managers have been very receptive to answering them. The employee and the company have to be a good fit for each other and that’s one way to find out!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdngzt5,t3_em33od,1578585607.0,I got a pair from Under Armor and they are pretty great! The seams don’t show and they stay put!
DysmorphicDisorder,fdhi3bl,t3_el0cde,1578423109.0,So relatable. I feel for you!
AskWomenOver30,fdhhxee,t1_fczanrj,1578423010.0,It sounds like people in your office are generally pretty respectful! I think that’s a necessary component of hot desking actually working- people have to be considerate and observant in order to not all drive each other insane all the time. I think you have to be *more* cautious and considerate in an open space than you normally would be! Perhaps my pessimism about human nature is showing here- I basically expect people to behave like babies everywhere I go and it absolutely shocks me when that’s not the case.
AskWomenOver30,fdhhf1z,t1_fczc29m,1578422703.0,"Yeah there’s definitely a lot more space for like... idle socializing, even when it’s unwelcome questions about your lunch! That’s just like... kinda inappropriate and unnecessary!"
AskWomenOver30,fcza1vc,t1_fcz8hip,1578096715.0,Thanks!!
AskWomenOver30,fcza15r,t1_fcz8stc,1578096703.0,"I think that's a spot-on analysis. 
I actually did ask in the interview ""why did they make the decision to go to hoteling desks?"" and the hiring manager was like ""well it forces people to collaborate more!....... And also it's easier to fit more employees in a smaller space this way.""
My response: ""Ah, so it's a Wild West free-for-all then?"" He chuckled as if I were joking... I wasn't.
The lunch thing is something I'm definitely worried about. I prefer to eat lunch at my desk because I don't want to have to be there later in the day because I took the full break. I just want to bolt when the clock strikes 5."
OkCupid,fcz9msk,t3_ejn4ru,1578096467.0,Honestly you seem like a really cool person and your profile seems earnest and descriptive while still being concise. I think you've done a good job!
AskWomenOver30,fcz8p3n,t1_fcy7ss6,1578095923.0,"I mean... it likely will be as bad as I'm imagining; I know myself very well and I've worked in loud, social offices before and it was not great (I had a desk though, so it wasn't total chaos). 
But I think if a) people can leave me the eff alone when I have headphones on and b) some accommodations can be made (work from home occasionally, hiding in a quiet spot, etc.) I'll be able to tolerate it. I think it's not so much a question of ""will I hate it"" as much as ""are there ways for me to tolerate it"" and the answer to both questions is a firm ""most likely."""
AskWomenOver30,fcz8cdt,t1_fcy8sco,1578095718.0,I AGREE. Whoever invented hot-desking is certainly in hell.
AskWomenOver30,fcz89iv,t1_fcy9lpt,1578095673.0,"Yeah definitely. I think at some point I will need to have a frank conversation with my manager and be like ""X, Y, and Z aren't working, let's please figure out some ways to make this smoother and more pleasant for me."" The worst they can do is say no!"
AskWomenOver30,fcz85sr,t1_fcyaehj,1578095613.0,I am seriously considering just dragging a GIGANTIC monitor around with me everywhere I go. Or setting it up in one spot and putting a cloth over it at the end of the day.
AskWomenOver30,fcz82np,t1_fcybhju,1578095562.0,"Right?! In what universe is this going to make people happier and want to work?! 
I think I'm also worried because I'm an artist and it's like a second job, and I'm afraid this work environment is going to suck the life out of me and I'll have no energy to make anything anymore. Which like... I can't afford to let work take everything from me."
AskWomenOver30,fcz7p36,t1_fcyed5k,1578095345.0,Thank you! I'm going to give it a trial period and see how it goes.
AskWomenOver30,fcz7lle,t1_fcyfp7i,1578095290.0,"Yes! I am going to scope out the quiet ""hiding spots"" so I can keep my sanity. I asked about work from home in the interview and it seems like they do allow people to do that, so I will absolutely ask for it. Not having to commute one day a week is also a pretty great side effect!"
AskWomenOver30,fcz7dvw,t1_fcylrgj,1578095168.0,Work at home is the BEST and I may try to negotiate some WAH days into my schedule once I get brought up to speed. I get so much more done at home anyway!
AskWomenOver30,fcz7agj,t1_fcyofea,1578095114.0,Yeah I think this is what I'll have to do. I'm going to see how it goes over the first few weeks and then speak up if things aren't working for me. I am VERY ready to advocate for myself and my needs.
AskWomenOver30,fcz6zha,t1_fcz2a9v,1578094935.0,"Yeah I am definitely going to keep looking. If I find myself getting tension headaches from craning over a laptop all day, I'm going to speak up. It's just awful that this is even a thing - clearly these companies don't give a hootie or a blowfish if the employees are all miserable."
AskWomenOver30,fcz6t0d,t1_fcz2z1r,1578094831.0,I'm not financially in the position to take something low-paying like that. It sucks but the city I live in is so expensive and I'm hella broke.
AskWomenOver30,fcz6pj9,t1_fcz3wi9,1578094777.0,"> I like the anonymity of moving from space to space as I please. I get privacy from moving to an area where I’m not well known.

This is exactly what I'm hoping will make it tolerable! I am also not above scheduling conference rooms for an hour or so when I need time to chill/get a break from the office. If people have a problem with that, they can speak up."
AskWomenOver30,fcz6eva,t1_fcz5to8,1578094608.0,"That's exactly what I'm worried about! The whole ""constantly anxious"" thing!! D:"
BodyPositive,fcy1w76,t3_eje7qp,1578073624.0,"Ugh nothing like your mom providing unsolicited input on your body/wardrobe, am I right? (massive eye roll)

Celebrate who you are and what you've got! And rock whatever looks you like! You're doing great!"
BodyAcceptance,fcup0t6,t1_fcmimjv,1577985630.0,"Yeah I know what you're saying - maybe she interpreted it that way when it came out. I'm generally not a person who loves sarcastic banter as a way of communication so I can see why I'd already be turned off to that kind of teasing. It's just like, I guess some people aren't super aware that teasing can actually be weirdly hurtful?"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fcld6sn,t1_fclar03,1577745080.0,Was going to say the exact same thing! Explore different activities and see what your body loves and what you start to look forward to. Take some drop-in classes of all sorts and see if any of them appeal to you! There are so many ways to get your body active and you're sure to find some that don't feel like drudgery. It's also perfectly fine to vary what you do so things don't get boring!
femalefashionadvice,fclcnux,t1_fckxftp,1577744745.0,"AHHH! That all is seriously so insightful because I'm like "".....am I the only messy person here? am I the only person in the world whose clothes get all bunchy and twisted?"" 
FWIW I am fine with not taping all my clothes down, it's just good to know how the sausage is made!"
femalefashionadvice,fcknnjf,t1_fbu8xzd,1577729248.0,"Oh yeah wow! Didn't even think of that! Everything looks super smooth because of shapewear.
Do you think they also pin/tape clothing down in all sorts of places as well? Cause like... buttons never gap when people move. Pockets of jeans never bunch up. Shirts never ride up. All that sort of stuff mystifies me!"
BodyAcceptance,fcknht3,t1_fbu9fu2,1577729149.0,">  they just don't have the same problems of their breasts being sexualized even in nonsexual situations that a woman with larger boobs has

This is like... such a hopeless spiral for me too! Cause it's like... you can wear ANY innocuous item of clothing and people think you look ""slutty"" because of something you can't control. It's all other people's perceptions and biases! Meanwhile smaller-busted women can wear literally anything and people see the clothes and not the boobs. Just a real pain in the... tits

I haven't seen her since so I haven't talked to her yet, but next time I see her I'll bring it up! Could be good to clear the air."
BodyAcceptance,fckn3rj,t1_fbv5ifh,1577728908.0,"I mean I guess backhanded compliments are... still compliments?  
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

As an adult, it's important to like... know the difference between a compliment couched in sarcasm and meanness, and a compliment that's earnest. And it's also everyone's responsibility to think before they speak. It's not my job to stage an archaeological dig for a diamond in a bucket of shit in this situation."
bigboobproblems,fckmonr,t1_fbvl8dy,1577728655.0,"LOL that type of geometry is advanced to me! But you're right, it's literally just subtraction and it's proportional! Come on people!"
houseplants,fckml02,t1_fbya6kf,1577728595.0,ooh OK! I don't think I was ever watering them that much! Also interesting about the humidifiers... I wonder if keeping it in the bathroom would be good for it?
BodyAcceptance,fckmh3k,t1_fbz81qh,1577728528.0,"I agree! It's hard to have ""confrontations"" but it is often good to clear the air."
femalefashionadvice,fbu7elg,t1_fbtotge,1577109187.0,">I never see lines or shaping from bras, underwear, tucked clothes.

It's all photoshop! IRL no one looks like that. I've been deprogramming myself from this for a really long time!"
