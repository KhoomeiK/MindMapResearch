Needafriend,fo9us7x,t3_g6g9fq,1587631914.0,"That all sounds very heavy for you. I wish I could say the right words but I just suck at that. And saying I hope things will get better for you always sounds a bit obvious. I mean ofc I hope that, but it’s not that easy to accomplish. I hope that still for you though :)"
aspergers,fo9u4v7,t3_g6bukh,1587631255.0,I have two screens. The person I talk to is on the screen I am not looking at and the webcam is on the screen I have some work on or a picture to focus on so they think I’m totally nailing that video call
depression,fjhl0nh,t3_fdc6rw,1583350169.0,RDR2 is also helping me through a rough patch. It’s a great game to distract you from irl. It can feel as a relief to have an escape or break from irl :)
aspergers,fjcu0bm,t3_fcntva,1583236622.0,All the time :D
autism,fibj81j,t3_f79lo0,1582323123.0,It looks really nice!
RedDeadOnline,fhi4a19,t3_f3cx2v,1581617490.0,I had the same yesterday. Very annoying
RDR2,fhbunon,t3_f2b052,1581450247.0,It's awesome!!
reddeadmysteries,fgs9pej,t1_fgs9832,1581077712.0,"I thought it had to to with what kind of horse I ride if I can shake the wolves of, but now you mention it it could be honor too.   
When I was in endgame and max honor I was near the glacier once and I encountered a pack of wolves and they just looked at me, and left. I thought they were maybe bugged or just not hungry XD  
Now I'm intrigued"
reddeadmysteries,fg4qyqj,t1_fg49gbg,1580509160.0,"Just tried, that is kinda cool :D"

Needafriend,fexk9hf,t3_equ7ra,1579432356.0,"Hey, I'm not very good at making friends. It just takes very long for me. But if you like to have a chat sometimes just send me a message and we'll just see :)  
(video games is always a good topic XD )"
aspergers,feude9i,t3_eqhn7l,1579385496.0,"Same here but I have that the other way around. Social interaction is very difficult for me and when I try befriending women I often disappoint because I don't meet their expectations somehow. I also respond very late and short to messages from people I don't know well, and that doesn't seem to bother men that much as it does women.  
And I just feel more comfortable with men, it talks easier somehow."
PCRedDead,feecjpa,t3_eopw3w,1579030954.0,"I had some issues with microstuttering as well, it got better when I capped the framerate at 58 in the NVIDIA control panel. Though it's still not fully gone, it is a big difference for me. I don't know much about it but this video explained it well for me. Also the freezes became a lot less.

Psychosis,fc56msa,t3_efzxpz,1577445905.0,"A loved on of me is suffering from this. And reading along on this reddit helps me a lot in learning and understanding, though I usually stay quiet because I'm so bad at saying what I mean XD  
 I've read your post and I don't know you personally. But maybe you should let those people read this post. For me it helps to know more about what's happening so I can put the things that are said into perspective. And I'll be honest, it can hurt ofcourse, but knowing and realizing what is going on helps so much.   
I know you suffer a lot from guilt. But this is something that is happening to you. I see that person in my life suffer from guilt as well and if only I could take that away, as it is hard enough already. Open up to them how you feel. Like the other person commented that writing a letter might a good way, and that is actually a great idea.    
I don't know if I'm much help here, but being open is from my point of view the best way. Don't be so punishing to yourself. When I read your post you seem like someone who truly cares about the well being of others."
RDR2,fbejpyx,t3_ecy1po,1576787215.0,I have the same problem for the last couple of days and every workaround doesn't work anymore. I've opened a ticket as I can't play story mode at all anymore :(
autism,f3ev2gc,t3_dgmzb6,1570885857.0,"I do the same. Mostly on phone or headset. People do tell me, but don't yell. I had a co worker once who was very annoyed with it but I can't really help it. I do try to speak louder but it cost me a lot of focus. With gaming I suggest people to turn my volume up."

I would want to say don't let it get to you, but I also take it personally when that happens while I shouldn't. It's just not easy to shake it off. It's better to forget but those are the ones that linger :(  
Still there are a lot of nice ones too, don't forget those. On this subreddit I've actually had often very kind and helpfull responses."
autism,erqwbt1,t3_c3drhq,1561153709.0,"The people I feel safe with I actually really need and enjoy a hug from sometimes. But it's very rare for me to feel safe with people.  With most I feel uncomfortable. People often think I'm very distant and I just don't want all that. But that's actually not true, I just have trouble with feeling close and safe enough with people and the discomfort of a hug lies in there, not because I don't like the hug. Maybe that goes for more people here."
aspergers,erqvqp8,t3_c3dimr,1561153281.0,Yeah that happens sometimes. And then I can't listen to it for years and all of a sudden it's back XD

aspergers,erp9b5n,t3_c34xg6,1561106177.0,"All the time. I try to ask back how someone with aspergers is supposed to look or behave from their point of view. It usually shuts them up.
I think people are just rude when saying that."
aspergers,erni4t7,t1_ernakkf,1561053161.0,I hyperfocus when I draw and when I make music.    It feels like a bubble to hide in from the world. My special place :)

Still I hope you can manage to be yourself.  So many people, so many opinions but there is only one you. Don’t go away from yourself too far, the road back is long. I can tell :("
Minecraft,er8btg1,t1_er8axcf,1560601125.0,Yeah I fear it’s gonna lead to that :D
aspergers,er5p6cr,t3_c0l0ia,1560530638.0,I'm struggling with the same :( Not much advice. I just came to say ' just fuck' with you. I'm so mad at myself as well. And indeed they make it sound so easy but it's a true boss fight with no easy mode :(

I remember when I was a noob, no clue what I was doing and pressed greed when that mount from Rivendare dropped. I still facepalm myself for that. I never saw it drop again"
Needafriend,er1k7ro,t1_er1i18t,1560432954.0,"Yeah I treasure those memories. I mained a belf warlock. I loved the raiding with the guild. With the funny stories I usually feel like you should have been there to understand why it was funny. I still giggle when my guildmaster hopped on my two seater mount and I drove him into Argus. He screamed like a little girl. That was when he learned the shy quiet one had a dark side as well.   
But also showing up for raids in the greatest transmog you could find. We had half of the raid team dressed as pirates at some point, It was awesome!"
Needafriend,er1fli0,t3_c033bc,1560431144.0,"I know how it feels, I had an awesome group of people I played WoW with for a long time, but everyone moved on and eventually I gave up on the game too. It felt so sad to log in and only find an empty home :( I had a friend I played other games with as well, spend a lot of time together, but people move on, lifes change and that also changed. It often feels like people are tired of the game way before I do, but maybe I'm too much of a collector and that is a bit boring to some XD"

So I know how you feel. I wish it was different too but people just can't handle that shit."
autism,eoutd7l,t3_bt6tvj,1558880249.0,"Yeah I have that as well. At funerals people think I don't give a shit, no tears, no expression at all. Or when someone tells me great news I often fake the reaction when I think of it in time but sometimes I can't and then I'm not enthusiastic at all. I know now I have the emotions, but I cannot reach them, I have a really hard time showing it and when I do it's not in common ways. With sadness or anger it does not show until I get a meltdown, and sometimes it feels the meltdown comes out of nowhere but when you had a funeral a few days before well, that was where the emotions went. Like they hide inside where you don't see it yourself and come out with an explosion. At least that's sortoff how it works for me. Not sure if I describe that the correct way but hope you understand what I mean."
