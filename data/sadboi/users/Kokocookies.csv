BDSMAdvice,ey8mmox,t1_ey8kbv1,1566923518.0,Thanks I’m gunna try that and see if it shows me anything I can’t see right now
BDSMAdvice,ey8jp6h,t1_ey8ieib,1566921627.0,"Thank you for this perspective, I honestly have a hard time seeing it from others eyes.. I really feel regretful and stupid and if I did try to talk to him I’d just feel like I overreacted and out of control of my emotions and I hate feeling that way but maybe it’s my ego idk I just want him to fix it but why would he if I said I didn’t want this anymore.. idk I’m a cluster fuck of contradictions and I don’t even know how to get what I want while also feeling heard and important enough to try to fix this with. I wanna reach out but I just don’t think it’s a good idea at least right now but I tend to hide my emotions until I can’t and then just blow up. I know that’s a terrible way to treat the ppl you love but it’s a trend through my life I can’t seem to quit. Thanks for your insight though it did help me see things differently."
