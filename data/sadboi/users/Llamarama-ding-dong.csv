And we decided to have a throuple for the summer. (Three way couple) mainly because we were horny teenagers. Eventually I notice that they are hanging out on their own and hooking up without letting me know. (Big whoop I didn’t care). And then they start to ghost me and not talk to me. I try asking what’s up and why they can’t talk. Kept getting deflected. Then I start getting blocked by the girl (my ex) and the other friend just stopped taking to me altogether. Kept ignoring my questions and rejected every hand I put out. Now I’m alone at home and lost my two best friends. Both of which were local unlike all my other friends from highschool. And now I think they’ve been spreading something about me and now more and more friends/acquaintances refuse to talk to me. It’s really killed me and destroyed my self esteem and confidence.
