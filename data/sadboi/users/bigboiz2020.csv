AskReddit,et1t3hl,t3_bgz7wa,1562403321.0,"So, I just moved out to my dad's to a small town reservation. And after a good night of video games. I turned off my PC and took off my headphones and just sat in the dark for a little bit. Listening to the outside noises (most of the area I live in is surrounded by woods btw.) Then I started hearing some yelling or someone calling for something. I just imagine it being the neighbors celebrating the weekend or something. Until I realize no one was really speaking. It just was a lot of high screeching. I can't really think of anything else that I might heard. Almost beginning to think it's the Spirits of the Tribe that lived there many years ago."

AskReddit,esnp8kz,t3_bocfr6,1562142884.0,"Two weeks before my 18th birthday I was kicked out of my house. (I deserved it tbh)  so I had to move in with my girlfriend which was good because I had a safety net, but it was awful because she was really manipulative in a poly relationship, and we ended leasing an apartment together. I was at the lowest I have ever felt in my life. I almost took my own life because I had felt so alone, embarrassed to ask for help, having bad connections with my mom, and my dad lived farther away from me at the time. But I just said ""fuck it.""  Picked myself up and talked to my mom. When I told my ex that I was leaving she turned into someone else, someone I had never seen in our whole entire relationship. She ended up punching a mirror and needing to get stitches, that's when I knew I needed to GTFO. I ended up getting on good terms with my mom, (Barely) finishing high school, and having a full time job. This was 7 months ago. and i am thankful I chose not to take my life. Please, even at the lowest lowest point of your life. You can fight through it all. <3"
