But its depends on what elo you're at. At lower elo many people arent focusing on farm but kills. This is true for higher elo as well but more exaggerated in lower elo. So you could look behind in terms of kda but be ahead in terms of gold and exp.

Unless you're actively trying to change yourself for improvement of the client, the quality of work will diminish over time.
