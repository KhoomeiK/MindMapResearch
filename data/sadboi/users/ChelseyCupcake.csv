We went to Opryland Hotel for my birthday.. an indoor water park, a swanky hotel, all the amenities and just basically a perfect night. 
The next day I was committed to die. It was my birthday and I just imagined my tombstone: 12/20/92- 12/20/19. It seemed right. I was ready to die, despite the night before being as amazing as I could ever imagine.
