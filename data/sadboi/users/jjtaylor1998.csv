""In conclusion, there is no robust evidence that intermittent fasting produces additional clinical benefits, compared to healthy and regular eating patterns. Instead, there is some evidence that delaying eating increases the risk of developing episodes of overeating and binge eating. For these reasons, it is inappropriate to recommend intermitting fasting as a healthy eating practice. 

Regular eating based on a healthy dietary pattern is the best choice to reduce the risk of disease and to avoid the development of unregulated and, in some cases, disturbed eating behavior."""

AmItheAsshole,fp4rbev,t3_gb8hiw,1588305459.0,"YTA. your boyfriend is right. forcing yourself to starve, even for a small window to lose weight, isnt healthy. especially if you not eating is making you angry & have other negative emotions. if you want to lose weight, a healthier way is to find filling, low calorie foods, or eating healthy food for meals. & hes right about the metabolism slowing down- putting your body into a starvation mode, even for four hours, will just lead to it storing even more fat when you finally do eat. your boyfriend is just trying to help his clearly struggling girlfriend who is getting angry at him bc of her lack of food intake. having hunger pains & getting emotional over them, laying in bed suffering til they go away, is NOT a healthy way to lose weight

and here i brought some science with me: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3680567/

""To improve health, the goal should be to lose weight by reducing the total amount of calories consumed, suggests Freedland, rather than focusing on when those calories are consumed. “If you [don’t] eat two days a week, and limit what you eat the other five days, you will lose weight. It’s one approach to losing weight,” he says. “I’m not sure it works any better than cutting down slightly seven days a week.” ""

AKA starving yourself so badly that youre having pains and being emotional is just effective because youre cutting calories, not because of the starving yourself part. which can be achieved the same way through low calories filling foods and exercise"
