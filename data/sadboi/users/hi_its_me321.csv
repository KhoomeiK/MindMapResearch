nutrition,fi5i6xu,t3_f6h0cq,1582163676.0,"I am in the medical field and have heard that drinking excess amounts of tea can possibly effect the absorption of iron in the gut and hence cause iron deficiency anemia. However, I think this is somewhat rare.

AskWomen,fhufufu,t1_fhsksn5,1581885874.0,"YES this exactly. I grew up with this and had very disordered eating because of it. I was always able to cover it up so people didn‚Äôt know but I would restrict my eating especially knew if I‚Äôd be consuming alcohol later. I was very very underweight yet my mom would always comment on how thin and good I looked which made me just continue what I was doing. 

I have a friend who eats healthy and has never had disordered eating. I am so jealous of her how she just eats ice cream without thinking twice about it. I would recommend not commenting on your child‚Äôs weight, but instead of on their personality/other non physical qualities. If you are dieting do not say it out loud to them, just do it yourself."

When I am stressed, taking a muscle relaxer really helps. I know some people that take one every night to help with bruxism. Perhaps this would be a cheaper and easier route to explore before what your dentist wants to try. Your PCP would be able to prescribe you this. 

I also find that alcohol increases my teeth grinding, so if you are someone that drinks a glass of wine every night, maybe try cutting this out as well to see if it helps."
