Pre-martial sex for both genders in prostitution places or whatever they are called should be sentenced to jail tbh. and as for that muslim rhetoric, muslims can be born anything, acting upon it is what wrong, and it goes the same way for straights actually why do they choose to do haram stuff and have sex before marriage? they want to bc God created them wanting to have it but you can just ignore all those feelings untill you're married. very simple and it goes both ways except for gays it goes for simply not acting on it by sexual intercourse"
