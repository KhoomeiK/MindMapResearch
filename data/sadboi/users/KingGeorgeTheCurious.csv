BPD,fn1rjid,t1_fn1qz3b,1586568441.0,Oh cool. Good on you for being honest about what you're looking for.
BPD,fn1qvdy,t3_fyh7we,1586568006.0,Can relate. Though if you're not interested in someone please don't waste their time talking to them.

HAIM,fjpx93s,t3_fd05aj,1583562737.0,"This music video played as YouTube ad for me and while I'm mad at the state of unavoidable commercialism/advertising being shoved down our throats (YT has been playing 2 ads before every video lately), I'm not mad that I encountered The Steps. 

I've been playing this song on repeat all night. This song rocks my socks off and it makes me cry ha. This is the first time I've ever felt like lyrics were calling me out. I'm that jackass who ended up mad at her for making a mess even when she took all the steps and I had too much going on to understand her at the time. Something about the sonic makeup of this song combined with the lyrics just breaks me down and makes me want to repent for my jackass ways. I'm fine up until she starts singing, ""So, baby...."" ðŸ¤˜ðŸ˜­"

BreakUps,fduh2vm,t3_en4ayb,1578732872.0,"Oh I've seen this before! Yeah you drag it out until you meet someone else you like then conveniently decide to finally end the relationship! Maybe even blaming him for it's demise all the while!...

My bitterness aside, just end it. Put him out of his misery. Guaranteed you're gonna meet someone else far better suited for you so just rip the bandaid and don't give this guy anymore false hope. Please, OP."

dating_advice,fcvc1nq,t1_fcut0of,1577998949.0,"It's astounding to me that people aren't getting that... They want OP to reflect on reasons he might have caused this breakup but the point is she didn't give him any reasons! That's fucking torture! Also, OP has mentioned in the comments that ex's friend confirmed there's another guy. So than just say you met someone else! That's reason enough on it's own! Both explanations are shitty but one at lease doesn't leave you wandering what the fuck you did wrong!"
dating_advice,fcuhyre,t1_fcuamr3,1577981396.0,"Nah I'm sick of this response. OP mentioned he later found out she was seeing someone else too. This is yet another breakup that should be as simple as ""hey I'm not feeling this anymore and I've met someone else. I'm sorry"". She doesn't need to kick OP when he's down. Whatever he might have contributed to the breakup is moot given that she's not interested in him regardless."
dating_advice,fcuh4j5,t1_fcudru1,1577980828.0,Maybe like the fact that she was seeing another guy? That might have served as a better explanation rather than breaking up with someone and blaming them for it.

BreakUps,evzvcx9,t1_evzazmb,1564968286.0,"Agreed. Especially when you know it was your own behavior that drove them away. I've reworked my life completely to have more to offer for the next girl, but nothing feels like it's ever going to be enough."

dating_advice,esxjrrw,t1_esunrnj,1562331531.0,"Ha! That sounds like my experience. I'm lucky enough to have a really charming smile. So charming that girls often overlooked my lack of substance. For years that validated a type of Narcissism inside me. I've been confused and heartbroken for years wondering why they'd go from head over heels for me to never wanting to talk to me again. It took losing ""the one that got away"" for me to finally truly self-reflect enough to see what I was lacking. Now it's all so painfully obvious. ðŸ™„"
