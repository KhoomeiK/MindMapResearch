I just hope it's what's actually going to make me happy, make me feel fulfilled, I'm just so scared the future won't work out at all, and I'm gonna end even more miserable mentally than I am now"

And yeah me and a friend talked about this recently actually, and i realized that i care way too much about having my life in order already when nobody knows what the hell is going on. I'm scared I'll waste my 10 years as i did with the rest of my life so far, so i got into the thinking that everything already has to be set and planned and man.. while i know now thanks to that friend, that nicely wrote it out in caps to me, that i don't need to have everything in order and have everything planned, I'm still so scared I'll just.. fail and waste the attempt trying to make it good"
SuicideWatch,eypr9nq,t1_eypqykm,1567308628.0,"I think the only thing really keeping me here are my 3 closest friends, since I'd feel bad for them if i ended my life, because 2 of them already have a lot of hardship in their lives, and the other one is such a genuinely positive person, who tries her best to keep me here, and i don't want to be that first thing in her life that really hits her hard, she doesn't deserve that.

other than that i really don't know what else there is, my hygiene is better than it used to be and i start caring about it quite a bit, and about my body in general, but theres almost daily this thought that it would be so much easier to just end it and stop trying to make it better, since it feels so hopeless. They tell you to care about yourself the most but i don't know how to when i just want this life to end really."

SuicideWatch,eypqw4e,t1_eypqm5w,1567308295.0,"Yeah i really can't. I thought that the road that i was going on was the right for me, currently learning to be a translator, to later travel the world and experience amazing things, and meet great people.
But even that doesn't sound like it's worth the struggle anymore, i don't have this set goal that everybody else seems to have, i don't have this ONE thing that makes sure to keep me going, and it's killing me, it's not like I'm stupid or bad at everything, but i can't set my mind to anything specific and man.. i don't know how to look for it"
SuicideWatch,eypqkni,t1_eypqbim,1567308024.0,"Youre right, i'll edit it. I'm currently undergoing an  apprenticeship as a translator, because languages have always been the only thing i was sort of good at, but now that im 2 years into it i don't know if it is what i want to do or if i want to do anything. I feel lost because everyone around has this set way of living and everyones doing great, but i have no clue what to do, or what I'm supposed to do or how to start to change this, I've tried alot"

depression,eylecej,t3_cxbnat,1567182529.0,"weird flex, but i always get this moment after i tripped on lsd, its not even while i trip, but around 10 hours after or even later, but i get it everytime.. it made me realise that its just not a random sadness but indeed an illness that makes my thoughts go in negative directions at all times, and that i should get it fixed. So yeah, this very brief moment where you almost catch yourself being like ""wait.. that's fucking depression, thats not me"", i get that as well :')"

SuicideWatch,etdtj9k,t3_cb83q9,1562714863.0,"You know when you start to get a dream, and you're getting really excited about it and think lifes gonna be perfect once you fulfilled the dream? like a dream job, a dream relationship, something like that. I've had lots of those dreams, currently only sort of do, and they've often been shattered by either realizing that it in fact isn't what i imagined.

But at this point i sort of live to have one of those dreams be fulfilled and actually fulfill my expectations. I still got hope. Don't know for how long but as long as i have this, this would probably be my reason"

SuicideWatch,etc19uq,t1_etblmgf,1562671696.0,"Hmm i'll be honest i've been playing lots of videogames since I'm 4 (am 19 now) and while it has been more of a just for fun thing as a kid, i currently have like 1-2 games i want to actually get really good in, and im playing those alot and actually slowly approaching pro level, cuz.. i'll be honest.. i feel like making money off that would be the dream, but it's really stressful as well, since everytime i fail it's often very frustrating as it feels like it puts me away from my dream.. and i just can't seem to enjoy much else in life anymore than that, it's kinda sad :')

I should really work out, i know, and I have been to the gym once as well.. but man just.. getting up and doing it is so hard, idk why.

And yeah, not feeling like i matter is pretty much the biggest reason why life seems so meaningless to me at this point sometimes. But thanks for the tip I'll try my best for that.

And.. I'll be honest.. Everyone around me seems very fine even if i wouldn't be there.. so.. idk who to fight for but myself at this point sometimes, I don't know any of my family as well (because i wanted to, they're not great people), except for my mom who.. i wouldn't say hate but very much dislikes me and always makes me feel the worst whenever we meet. I do care alot my friends though, but I feel like I'm always the second choice for everyone so sometimes i feel really useless and just.. like a person to be around for convenience, but if anything is keeping me here it's them for sure.

And man i swear to god, sometimes i feel like I'm just not made.. for life xD i grew up playing video games as i said, and i improve really quickly at them, got to a rank in league in a year for example which most others need 3+ years for, and I just feel like.. I know what I'm doing there and how i can improve etc while in real life i feel like the biggest dork with literally anything, it's tough.. But I definitely am getting better at that as you said.. Comes with time i suppose.

And i will try to not give up on life, even though it's getting harder and harder each year i feel like, but thank you for the kind words, means alot to me that someone actually took the time and typed something out like that. nobody ever does, so.. thank you!"

Might do that with my roommate or sth as well so someome I'm always around knows as well, but i really don't want to be a burden as well you know? :')"
