BingeEatingDisorder,fkp7lxd,t1_fkoh3el,1584403618.0,"Long story short, it hit me that I had a binge eating issue when I was loading a 12pc bucket of KFC chicken (all sides and biscuits included), 12 tacos from Taco Bell and two huge Sweet Green salads into my car, all bought within an hour of each other with the intention of being consumed that same evening. I had a habit of eating until I felt nauseous. I knew that my binge eating was a result of my abusive childhood but I didn’t know exactly how. After some soul searching and looking back on my childhood I realized that one of the reasons is because food was the only thing that I could control and that brought me joy as a child, especially sweets (as I got older I started craving the savory stuff). I remember being a kid (like 10 years old) spending my entire allowance on sweets, waiting until nobody was watching and devouring the whole thing. I mean, I would stay up for hours into the morning just eating because that was the only time that I had to myself since everyone else was asleep. I didn’t want anyone to see me and start asking questions. I guess I also felt ashamed and didn’t realize it. I also realized that my binge eating was connected to the anger that I had towards my mother. I realized this because as I got older I would get upset over anything and my first thought was food. I saw food as a source of joy, not nutrition soon to combat my anger I did the only thing I knew that would make me happy again. I worked on this issue myself and didn’t really tell anyone, not even my therapist. After two years of learning how to forgive, manage my anger, and re-create my relationship with food, I am able to say that I haven’t binged in 8 months and I’m down 15 pounds. One thing that helped me get through it was realizing that that issue would not go away over night. While working through my issues I still had binge moments. They just became fewer and further between until they did not serve their purpose as a coping mechanism anymore. I don’t beat myself up about the binges because I knew that they would keep happening until I solved the problem causing them. I was actively solving the problem so I knew that they wouldn’t continue for long. For people like us who have binge eating disorders losing weight is not as simple as “put down the fork.” It’s mostly a mental thing. Until you get your mind right you’ll just keep picking it up. 

Side note: Another cause of the binge eating was my fathers alcoholism. He binge drank until the day he died and drinking is what killed him. I grew up with addiction as an example. My poison just happened to be food instead of liquor. I sympathize with him more now that I understand how you can have an addiction and not even realize it. I was binging since childhood but it didn’t hit me until I was 24, loading all that food into my car."

Anxiety,fk2y8mx,t3_fg3x6f,1583812134.0,When ever I’m done with a high anxiety moment I feel winded. I’m not literally out of breath but I feel like I am. It feels like I’ve been anxious for so long that I don’t know how I feel not being anxious so when the moment is over all my energy is gone.
