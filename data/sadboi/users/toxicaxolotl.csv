therapy,fo8m9sq,t3_g66yzh,1587599340.0,"I plan on being a therapist one day and I can confidently say that there will never be a day when introspection, self-analysis, self-understanding, and mindful thinking won't benefit you. But, these things don't always have to happen in a therapist's office.

What might help is if you told your therapist that you're looking for practices that you can take out and do on your own. Alternatively, you can think through the sort of practices that they have you do in the office, and take them home with you.

I wish you the best of luck!"
therapy,fo8ijr6,t3_g6aimo,1587597237.0,"Answering this is sort of tightrope walk because it seems like you may be spiraling, but my answer to this and how you're feeling right now would just be to relax.

You know exactly why you're pushing girls away; you're afraid of messing things up. This kind of insecurity will never, ever pan out for you. You have to remind yourself over and over that this girl, whatever girl is interested, chose you. She had other options, but she decided on her own that you were what is best for her.

You don't need to prove that to her, or worry about losing it. If at some point she chooses that you are not what is best for her, that doesn't mean you're a bad person, and it doesn't mean she is either; it just means you don't fit. If you decide she's not what's best for you, the same is true. But if you really like a girl, and you're just scared about messing things up, remember that at that given moment, she wants you. She chose you. You don't need to convince her to make that choice.

However, if someone you're interested in is already in a monogamous relationship, try to analyze the thoughts that you have about her and redirect them to a more platonic side of things. There are enough hot girls for everyone, don't worry. Someone will take her place."

The opposite is also true: being depressed doesn't mean you're always sad all the time. There are lots of other symptoms of depression, among them being anger, frustration, restlessness, exhaustion, and even body aches, but with symptom management, depression isn't just a permanent frown on your face."
