Another things that bothers me is how he post so much about his merch on insta stories...how many tshirts, bags,hoodies and 213131 unnecessary things he needs to produce? Jeffree has always promoted overconsumption, but now I feel like Shane is starting to do the same. Okay relase some T-shirts and hoodies, but don't do this every month, no one needs to buy that many Tshirts and bags from someone's merch..."

A lot of anxiety,depression, uneasinnes, overthinking, etc., comes from thoughts about the future or from the past. The only moment you are living is the now, you can't change the past and you can't predict the future, so why worry about it. He is also talking about medidation, so while I was reading I was already getting into it as well and now I'm practicing few times a week. Which I also recommend for people that have anxiety.

The sublte art of not giving a fuck - It's not like I read something that I've never realised before, but it was a good reminder, to not give a fuck about every little thing that happen in your life and focus on more greater and meaningful things that matter to you. For example someone was rude to you, or you're stressing what your collegues at work are thinking about you, there is simply no point doing that. If you don't care about small things like that, you are making your life easier. In this book the author was saying that you should look at life like you have a limited amount of fucks to give and at the end of the day think, when you are on your death bed are you going to think ""Oh yes, it was really worth it to overthink for days what my collegues think about me""..."

If there is open viewing in a really central part, just don't go, because there will be at least 20 more people there. As someone else said here, it's not worth it to have premium account on the online platforms, we had it, it didn't made any difference...Another advice I have is to write something like a letter, telling a bit about yourself and your partner, how you met and some romantic stuff, that might help with some people :) Good luck!"
