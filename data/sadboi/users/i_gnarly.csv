xxfitness,fnudzrb,t1_fntp52m,1587259972.0,"Ok, I’ll spill the blood...

summer 2017, i was invited to attend and participate in the demo/introduction of ‘The Cut,’ her cardio kickbox class for Equinox. 

the same day, Joe Biden — a non-controversial figure at the time — was in town. I planned my day around where the blockade would be. Ya know, the time of my thesis meeting was perfect, i wouldn’t get home in a timely manner but i’d beat the traffic to get to Equinox Downtown LA with time to work on said thesis.

Glasses on, backpack full, I see my ideal spot on the patio at Equinox. 

Next thing I know, I’m being picked up off the ground and people don’t want to look at me, staff included. 

Apparently I had walked into the immaculately cleaned glass doors I had entered and exited many times before, got a concussion, and a CUT.

This cut was actually my brow split to the bone. I grew up in a medical family so to me, it’s no big deal. I get some gauze and whatever else you find in a basic First-Aid kit and dizzily walk across the gym to get dressed for ‘The Cut.’

All of the instructors, including Christa are just staring at me while I smile and go into the locker room. The cut was worse than it felt. Blood was all over my face, I can’t get it to stop bleeding, and the Joe Biden blockade arrives outside on the very cross streets EQ DTLA is on. 

I’m like whatever let’s do this. Then, I jokingly send a photo to my medical professional parents with the EQ tagline ‘Equinox: Summer Ready.’ They tell me to get the fuck over my ego and to a hospital. 

As I’m sadly walking out trying to figure out how I’m going to drive to a hospital, Christa and team offer to start the demo late to help me out. 

She got the attention of some police to help escort me and my car out of the blockade and over to the hospital for 12 stitches. 

She still DMs me now and then to check on ‘The Cut.’ I can’t seem to shake the nickname. Apparently, I went mini-internal-Equinox viral.

She was insanely kind, not grossed out, laughing with me, invited me to join at another club, asked for my IG handle, and hit me up the next day to make sure I was ok. 

She was the only one in that entire gym tough enough to help me out.

seriously though, i need to give myself a rest day but i get anxious. i set myself up to think, ‘i woke up at 6am, (fun and necessary) projects and stuff wont take up the whole day, i don’t want to just sit around, i’m scared of trying new things, so what the heck am i going to do if i don’t exercise?!’

i need to get over that mindset. like i said, i set myself up for it with those thoughts. i need to shut them down! i need to realize i’ve tried a lot of new things, creative endeavors, taking care of life stuff i’d otherwise ‘avoid’ and that i’m doing it at a pace that’s not frantic.

neurofeedback stimulates other areas of the brain and aims to stabilize certain frequencies depending on the behaviors/conditions to address.

what the article alludes to is EEG/qEEG SMR-beta training. this includes visual and audio cues and is slightly altered for each individual, which is partially why this hasn’t entered the mainstream as a tertiary mode to traditional talk and medication therapy. 

i had already undergone ‘brain training’ before the thesis and since, have worked with an expert clinician. yes, i’ve tried the method commonly used with patients suffering from depression though not depressed. i found it helped underlying anxiety i didn’t know was present. i was better able to focus and i guess had similar results to those who suffered from depression. my brain was able to enhance qualities ‘brain training’ aims for treat in those with depression."

i also like to give such feels a ‘name.’ hi, anger, you’re welcome here...’ similar to what others have said about befriending it. sometimes i imagine what it looks like, see it sitting on a bench, sit beside it, listen to it just long enough, and gracefully walking away."
energy_work,fmwtlxz,t3_fxrfm5,1586452811.0,"a source of that anger for me has been not feeling heard, not knowing how to hear myself, and speak my truths...

i’ve had to learn not to be a ‘lint roller.’ i used to think i was a doormat for y’all other people to wipe their emotions on as i let them into my mental/physical/spiritual home but i realized i was actually collecting the fuzz. 

this really reared its head when i got sober. i felt i had an obligation to hear everyone. i spent much of my life feeling i wasn’t heard. i now understand i didn’t use my voice because i used others in a way to silence my true, inner voice and allow it to speak.

i was angry about it and wouldn’t allow myself to be angry. i wanted to instantly uncover what was under the anger as i had spent my teens full of explosive anger that was directed at my parents. it never came out anywhere else in that way. 

i’ve become less and less reactive. whatever anger, it’s not mine. i don’t blame myself for someone else’s anger anymore. i’m not ‘god;’ i’m not responsible for how others feel and i can no longer expend energy trying to change it. small but significant ‘anecdote:’ if someone was at my house and got a parking ticket, i’d be consumed by guilt...no one ever blamed it on me. this relates to how people can blame me for their anger but through the realizations scattered in this comment, i don’t have to take it on. maybe a better way to relate this is, the person behind me in line at a coffee shop who is upset that i can’t get my change together fast enough and then shows disrespect for the next person in front of them is going through their own stuff. they’re not angry at me. 

as for a method to alleviate the feelings you describe: i try to breathe in ‘let’ and exhale ‘go.’ it helps me let in the light and go forth without the ‘lint.’ it’s also a way i can offer peace through energy without depleting my own."

the anger in my family and the way mine acted out was partially a result of not feeling heard and hurting because anger prevented sharing feelings honestly and being able to hear my parents. i could ‘hear’ what was under the anger but it was dampened by that."

TellMeAFact,fmra1el,t3_fwmo1e,1586317496.0,"my friend can’t post more than a photo or two a day. she has to get permission before posting one with someone like me, who isn’t ‘famous’ or at least another ‘influencer.’ 

it also allows her to mess around with the media and paparazzi. she and i were at the gym when her instagram and media outlets like TMZ said she was on her yearly trip to umm, where she goes on her yearly November vacation!

she’s ‘famous’ but people mostly know her because of her ‘status’ as an ‘influencer.’"

SkincareAddiction,fmpdlst,t1_fmp6lux,1586278945.0,"i thought the lack of sun would be a disaster...i’ve always used the best sunscreens but that natural vitamin D was still helpful. 

i live in an area where it’s not so easy to get outdoors even though it’s an ideal place to get out for walks and bike rides. 

and yeah! a new ‘stay at home’ venture!"
kettlebell,fmp63ie,t3_fwlggk,1586275128.0,"agree with the commends above. nit picky but maybe stand up a little straighter at the top. hips move forward a little too much. 

the KB might be too light. you know when it’s easy to bring it so high and when it’s easy to hit hips forward rather than coming straight back up.

that neck alignment though! yesss!"

thanks for confirming these products aren’t a ‘placebo’ effect. 

congrats on feeling great about your skin xx"

CongratsLikeImFive,fmp52z3,t3_fwe0ls,1586274587.0,"90 in 90? congrats! 

i hope you know that people with ‘less time’ than i can help me more than those with gears and years. 

you’ve inspired me to let myself celebrate my sobriety with others. i get shy and don’t want to tell people and in my head i’m like, ‘ugh fine i’ll take a cake for newcomers.’ 

so not easy. and it’s not easy to maintain abstinence but ‘we’ are not alone. 

thank you for sharing and reminding me we all get to be proud. 

i hope you’re finding all the resources and support despite ‘zoom meetings’ and the other ways we have to work together...one day at a time...or one second at a time lol"
