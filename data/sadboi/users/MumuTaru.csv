SuicideWatch,fqzzenm,t3_glv9ih,1589779345.0,That’s the truth. I’m always someone’s second choice and have been on my own and alone for so long. I just don’t see a way to be happy in this world. I never get what I want even if I try and none of what I do seems to even matter.
AskAstrologers,fqtqx93,t1_fqtiv8b,1589644362.0,It could be. Gemini rising is a difficult sign to stay put. They don’t know what they want and always on the go or restless. They are chatty and warm people. But decisions are difficult because they want to sample and see everything. They are childlike. And charismatic and talkative people. But very flighty and move on really quickly. Whereas Sagittarius knows what they want. To have two fire signs is a powerful combo and Gemini won’t want to be controlled. They want their freedom. Leo is a “me first” type of sign. Meaning they take they lead or want to come first in all things. With Sagittarius in your chart it kind of enhances this characteristic and may come off as commanding. Which isn’t a bad thing. You aren’t necessarily being rude just command attention and wanna go first. Whereas Gemini May miss this que with Leo in front and May decide something is way more interesting at the moment. Think ADHD but In a sign. They may choose gaming or going outside or whatever else instead of hanging with you or putting you first. The world is their oyster. It might be hard for the Sagittarius rising to not feel jaded or left out. But sag is the gentler of the two fire signs. You may explode but you rush to apologize right after. You don’t want to harm the one you love or care for. You may be frustrated most of the time but you’re also inquisitive and May share in some of the Gemini’s ADHD moments but you just don’t share the same flightiness and May get frustrated or feel ignored. But you are gentle and caring. You want your partner to be happy and don’t want them to change themselves but sometimes it may feel like they aren’t putting you first even when they think they are. Gemini is an annoying sign to have in your chart. They are the most hated by Scorpios. Lol. The problem will be that you have two fire signs and he had two air signs. Even more flightiness. The need to move. The need to act. The need to see and experience and drink it all in. It may leave you feeling exhausted sometimes. You’re both fair minded peacekeepers. So you’re communication probably will be really good. This will help when you need to explain you need to slow down. Let your Gemini go run around for awhile while you stay in and rekindle your flame. This way you don’t cage him and you don’t exhaust yourself.
AskAstrologers,fqsh46f,t3_gkp7fb,1589607117.0,It kind of depends on your rising sign.

depression,fpf6vdr,t3_gd41l0,1588563215.0,First take a couple of breaths. Being in a new place with depression is rough. Accept that that part will eventually change. However the feelings of your old friends no longer caring is very real. Last year most of mine either abandoned me or I uncovered them as fakes and dumped them all. So not having anyone is very real to me and I struggle with suicidal thoughts all the time. I’m always the one that cares too much. And I’m always the one still there when people make mistakes. I accept that people make mistakes. I don’t think I should dump a friend for making bad choices or a big mistake right off the bat. I’m just loyal and I care a lot. A lot a lot. And people take that for granted. They know I’ll be there. It’s frustrating and lonely helping other people but having no one that has your back. It feels like you’re pressed into a corner and you’re stuck in survival mode. You always apologize for everything and everything feels like it’s your fault or if maybe you weren’t you but someone else you wouldn’t be left all the time. People say that that reflects on other people’s behaviors and they’re right but it doesn’t change anything about your situation or how it feels to you. Either way you’re still left alone and the same people telling you it gets better or you’ll find friends or whatnot are the same ones who don’t message you on reddit ever again or the same ones who don’t text you back unless they want something or you text them first. You don’t matter to the majority of the people on this planet and it’s a fact hat hurts deeply.

depression,fpd9rke,t1_fopo281,1588522729.0,It’s hard to live with the fact that someone can be totally fine without you when you’re not without them. Watching them move on and do all the things they said they’d never do to you. Trying to accept everything when you were with them for so long is the hardest thing to do especially when you love that person and especially when you don’t particularly hate them.
depression,fpd9gsa,t1_fpcujfp,1588522559.0,Yeah that’s exactly what happens. You pick them up for someone else. I want to feel loved and respected. I want to feel like a priority to someone. But I’m always abandoned for someone else. Friends do it. Family did it. Lovers do it.
depression,fpctp2j,t3_gcqgu7,1588512409.0,I’m the same way. I help everyone else but once they’re back on their feet they don’t need me anymore. I end up depressed and thinking about dying a lot just because I have no one. Not like deep relationships with people. Just a bunch of people I talk to. Everyone leaves me. My family did and all my close partners. And most of my friends. I have like two friends but only one of them is deep ish. And they live no where near me. The pandemic hasn’t hanged anything for me as far as relationships go because there are none and when it lifts and goes away I still won’t have anyone.

depression,foplh29,t3_g8tzbm,1587964686.0,I had a lover that did the same thing. Left me once with no explanation this pst September. He didn’t come back til December then left again in January. He’s ghosted me since then. No contact. Leaves my messages on read. He suffered tremendously from depression and I don’t know if I made it worse but I feel like shit that I no longer was able to bring joy to his life. He doesn’t text or answer my calls. At the end of this month it’ll be four months. It is incredibly painful. I suffer from suicidal ideation and depression too. I didn’t know others ghosted people they supposedly loved. I guess I’m not the only one with someone whose significant other bailed on them. Don’t hold your breath that she will come back but it is possible that she feels overwhelmed with love and obligations and responsibility. Life itself is just so hard what normal people have to do to get by is an enormous mountain for others. She might be falling out of love with you or she might not be able to cope.

It’s a sad cold existence and everyone is selfish telling you you’re wrong for wanting to kill yourself. But you’re not. We should have assisted suicide. It shouldn’t be taboo to talk about not wanting to live. Some of us don’t feel like we belong here. Our souls cry everyday for death. I love the cold blade on my wrists though I’ve been cutting my thighs so people can’t see. But it doesn’t replace where I need to feel the pain by slashing my wrists. I recently failed to hang myself. I understand how you feel.

SuicideWatch,fiwbm57,t3_fa6a29,1582780407.0,It’s an injustice that some people get easy lives while others suffer and lose from the beginning. If one thing had changed then it wouldn’t be a total disaster but it happened anyway. And nothing you do or say can change that. People don’t realize their actions effect other people maybe for years. If my dad hadn’t fucked up I wouldn’t be here but I also wouldn’t have suffered the bullshit I’ve gone through because of him. My dad got involved woth a shitty woman and he knew she was shitty. And because of that I was raped and molested and abused for years. I got robbed of my life. My life was ruined the moment I was born. And continued to get worse.
SuicideWatch,fiwbdoy,t3_fa6c1y,1582780203.0,I have rent due in a few days and I’m short as well. I’m unemployed because of my depression and anxiety.

Holding down a job has been a nightmare for two years. I’ve had interviews and not gotten jobs. I have one tomorrow which I’m trying not to be hopeful about. I failed a couple weeks ago and just kind of trying to figure everything out. I can barely survive on my own. I don’t want to be homeless again.

If my parents hadn’t fucked around and gotten pregnant so young I wouldn’t have ever had the life I did. Over before it began. Raped and molested between four years old to fourteen. And then my parents acted like it never happened and all my outbursts were just overdramatized apparently. It’s like it didn’t happen. Like I was living in a nightmare. And my life has only gotten worse. Unable to find work to pay my bills. My grandfather who has barely been able to help me is tired of helping. I’m just a burden and nothing I do or say ever seems to matter. I fight for justice and good and the unheard but I’m still unheard. I’m 29 and No one notices or cares about me and my problems. I was left on my own. I had a fiancé who dumped me homeless on the street. People will always choose themselves. Always.

I think I may be ending my life soon. I can’t take it anymore. I’m losing my will to live and fight. Every victory is overshadowed with immeasurable pain and loss and loneliness it just turns to bitter ashes in my hands. Hope. Hope only makes everything worse.

You’ll be the taboo on that their lips don’t speak of and eventually your name will die in the mouths proclaiming they cared for you. Where are those people? If they cared they’d be there. But it isn’t their choice. It is more selfish to force someone to live for someone else because THEY are the ones that will feel bad is the most selfish guilt trip you can make AND is the most Common refute non depressed people make against taking your life.

SuicideWatch,fclf4qn,t3_eht6un,1577746350.0,You want to hit the carotid artery if you’re going the knife route. Or nitrogen gas.
Psychosis,fcj6g3h,t3_ehgd84,1577678436.0,I can’t tell the difference either. Half the time I think I have multiple personalities and the other half I’m talking to myself like full convos and. I can’t tell what’s going on anymore in my head. Runaway thoughts that segment everywhere like train tracks or full blown conversations?
depression,fcip8fv,t1_fcifaka,1577666577.0,I have no family and very few friends. I can’t say whether they love me or not. But your comment moved me. Sometimes it makes it harder to think about going when I see my cat sitting there with his head tilted staring at me and I realize that I’m his whole world. But other times the suicidal thoughts are almost unbearable. I’m glad mine have calmed down now that the holidays are over. But from October to now I’ve survived four suicide attempts. One was accidental. One failed. And two I pussied out from fear. Well they all failed obviously. My days Are endless and a nightmare. I feel like a burden all the time to those around me. Like I have nothing to contribute so I’m a waste of space and I don’t want to be other people’s’ problem.
depression,fcf0146,t3_eh170w,1577625290.0,I haven’t made any new attempts on my life but I tried four times in two months. I regret they failed. That I’m a coward.

darksouls3,fc3b4np,t1_fc32pd3,1577385852.0,I guess I did everything backwards. Did the chapel before the keep.
