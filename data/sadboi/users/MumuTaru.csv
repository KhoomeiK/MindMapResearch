SuicideWatch,fqzzenm,t3_glv9ih,1589779345.0,That‚Äôs the truth. I‚Äôm always someone‚Äôs second choice and have been on my own and alone for so long. I just don‚Äôt see a way to be happy in this world. I never get what I want even if I try and none of what I do seems to even matter.
AskAstrologers,fqtqx93,t1_fqtiv8b,1589644362.0,It could be. Gemini rising is a difficult sign to stay put. They don‚Äôt know what they want and always on the go or restless. They are chatty and warm people. But decisions are difficult because they want to sample and see everything. They are childlike. And charismatic and talkative people. But very flighty and move on really quickly. Whereas Sagittarius knows what they want. To have two fire signs is a powerful combo and Gemini won‚Äôt want to be controlled. They want their freedom. Leo is a ‚Äúme first‚Äù type of sign. Meaning they take they lead or want to come first in all things. With Sagittarius in your chart it kind of enhances this characteristic and may come off as commanding. Which isn‚Äôt a bad thing. You aren‚Äôt necessarily being rude just command attention and wanna go first. Whereas Gemini May miss this que with Leo in front and May decide something is way more interesting at the moment. Think ADHD but In a sign. They may choose gaming or going outside or whatever else instead of hanging with you or putting you first. The world is their oyster. It might be hard for the Sagittarius rising to not feel jaded or left out. But sag is the gentler of the two fire signs. You may explode but you rush to apologize right after. You don‚Äôt want to harm the one you love or care for. You may be frustrated most of the time but you‚Äôre also inquisitive and May share in some of the Gemini‚Äôs ADHD moments but you just don‚Äôt share the same flightiness and May get frustrated or feel ignored. But you are gentle and caring. You want your partner to be happy and don‚Äôt want them to change themselves but sometimes it may feel like they aren‚Äôt putting you first even when they think they are. Gemini is an annoying sign to have in your chart. They are the most hated by Scorpios. Lol. The problem will be that you have two fire signs and he had two air signs. Even more flightiness. The need to move. The need to act. The need to see and experience and drink it all in. It may leave you feeling exhausted sometimes. You‚Äôre both fair minded peacekeepers. So you‚Äôre communication probably will be really good. This will help when you need to explain you need to slow down. Let your Gemini go run around for awhile while you stay in and rekindle your flame. This way you don‚Äôt cage him and you don‚Äôt exhaust yourself.

depression,fpf6vdr,t3_gd41l0,1588563215.0,First take a couple of breaths. Being in a new place with depression is rough. Accept that that part will eventually change. However the feelings of your old friends no longer caring is very real. Last year most of mine either abandoned me or I uncovered them as fakes and dumped them all. So not having anyone is very real to me and I struggle with suicidal thoughts all the time. I‚Äôm always the one that cares too much. And I‚Äôm always the one still there when people make mistakes. I accept that people make mistakes. I don‚Äôt think I should dump a friend for making bad choices or a big mistake right off the bat. I‚Äôm just loyal and I care a lot. A lot a lot. And people take that for granted. They know I‚Äôll be there. It‚Äôs frustrating and lonely helping other people but having no one that has your back. It feels like you‚Äôre pressed into a corner and you‚Äôre stuck in survival mode. You always apologize for everything and everything feels like it‚Äôs your fault or if maybe you weren‚Äôt you but someone else you wouldn‚Äôt be left all the time. People say that that reflects on other people‚Äôs behaviors and they‚Äôre right but it doesn‚Äôt change anything about your situation or how it feels to you. Either way you‚Äôre still left alone and the same people telling you it gets better or you‚Äôll find friends or whatnot are the same ones who don‚Äôt message you on reddit ever again or the same ones who don‚Äôt text you back unless they want something or you text them first. You don‚Äôt matter to the majority of the people on this planet and it‚Äôs a fact hat hurts deeply.

depression,fpd9rke,t1_fopo281,1588522729.0,It‚Äôs hard to live with the fact that someone can be totally fine without you when you‚Äôre not without them. Watching them move on and do all the things they said they‚Äôd never do to you. Trying to accept everything when you were with them for so long is the hardest thing to do especially when you love that person and especially when you don‚Äôt particularly hate them.
depression,fpd9gsa,t1_fpcujfp,1588522559.0,Yeah that‚Äôs exactly what happens. You pick them up for someone else. I want to feel loved and respected. I want to feel like a priority to someone. But I‚Äôm always abandoned for someone else. Friends do it. Family did it. Lovers do it.
depression,fpctp2j,t3_gcqgu7,1588512409.0,I‚Äôm the same way. I help everyone else but once they‚Äôre back on their feet they don‚Äôt need me anymore. I end up depressed and thinking about dying a lot just because I have no one. Not like deep relationships with people. Just a bunch of people I talk to. Everyone leaves me. My family did and all my close partners. And most of my friends. I have like two friends but only one of them is deep ish. And they live no where near me. The pandemic hasn‚Äôt hanged anything for me as far as relationships go because there are none and when it lifts and goes away I still won‚Äôt have anyone.

depression,foplh29,t3_g8tzbm,1587964686.0,I had a lover that did the same thing. Left me once with no explanation this pst September. He didn‚Äôt come back til December then left again in January. He‚Äôs ghosted me since then. No contact. Leaves my messages on read. He suffered tremendously from depression and I don‚Äôt know if I made it worse but I feel like shit that I no longer was able to bring joy to his life. He doesn‚Äôt text or answer my calls. At the end of this month it‚Äôll be four months. It is incredibly painful. I suffer from suicidal ideation and depression too. I didn‚Äôt know others ghosted people they supposedly loved. I guess I‚Äôm not the only one with someone whose significant other bailed on them. Don‚Äôt hold your breath that she will come back but it is possible that she feels overwhelmed with love and obligations and responsibility. Life itself is just so hard what normal people have to do to get by is an enormous mountain for others. She might be falling out of love with you or she might not be able to cope.

It‚Äôs a sad cold existence and everyone is selfish telling you you‚Äôre wrong for wanting to kill yourself. But you‚Äôre not. We should have assisted suicide. It shouldn‚Äôt be taboo to talk about not wanting to live. Some of us don‚Äôt feel like we belong here. Our souls cry everyday for death.

If my dad hadn‚Äôt fucked up I wouldn‚Äôt be here but I also wouldn‚Äôt have suffered the bullshit I‚Äôve gone through because of him.

And then my parents acted like it never happened and all my outbursts were just overdramatized apparently. It‚Äôs like it didn‚Äôt happen. Like I was living in a nightmare. And my life has only gotten worse. Unable to find work to pay my bills. My grandfather who has barely been able to help me is tired of helping. I‚Äôm just a burden and nothing I do or say ever seems to matter. I fight for justice and good and the unheard but I‚Äôm still unheard. I‚Äôm 29 and No one notices or cares about me and my problems.

It doesn‚Äôt get better or easier. I won‚Äôt lie to you. You will have to face those demons that make you who you are everyday. Worse yet was when one of my families found out I was suicidal they said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre life isn‚Äôt even that bad‚Äù.
SuicideWatch,fcneat6,t3_ei4syd,1577809923.0,Being raped takes something away from you you‚Äôll never get back. And there‚Äôs no one you can tell because no one will believe you. I tried telling everyone about mine. I was younger than you. 4 years old when it started. It was my stepdad and it didn‚Äôt stop for another ten years.
SuicideWatch,fcncwct,t3_ei4pml,1577809008.0,"I wish I could stop being a burden. Life isn‚Äôt worth it. If you still wanna give life another go, I survived four suicide attempts in the last two months. You‚Äôre more than welcome to sit at the void with me and see New Years through. New year new friend."
SuicideWatch,fcmpada,t3_ei0hnl,1577785486.0,"It‚Äôs like cutting, it‚Äôs euphoric. Whenever inthink of suicide I think of freedom from this painful existence. I thought I was the only one who felt that way. 

P.S. I survived 4 attempts"

Psychosis,fcj6g3h,t3_ehgd84,1577678436.0,I can‚Äôt tell the difference either. Half the time I think I have multiple personalities and the other half I‚Äôm talking to myself like full convos and. I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs going on anymore in my head. Runaway thoughts that segment everywhere like train tracks or full blown conversations?
depression,fcip8fv,t1_fcifaka,1577666577.0,I have no family and very few friends. I can‚Äôt say whether they love me or not. But your comment moved me. Sometimes it makes it harder to think about going when I see my cat sitting there with his head tilted staring at me and I realize that I‚Äôm his whole world. But other times the suicidal thoughts are almost unbearable. I‚Äôm glad mine have calmed down now that the holidays are over. But from October to now I‚Äôve survived four suicide attempts. One was accidental. One failed. And two I pussied out from fear. Well they all failed obviously. My days Are endless and a nightmare. I feel like a burden all the time to those around me. Like I have nothing to contribute so I‚Äôm a waste of space and I don‚Äôt want to be other people‚Äôs‚Äô problem.
depression,fcf0146,t3_eh170w,1577625290.0,I haven‚Äôt made any new attempts on my life but I tried four times in two months. I regret they failed. That I‚Äôm a coward.

darksouls3,fc3b4np,t1_fc32pd3,1577385852.0,I guess I did everything backwards. Did the chapel before the keep.
