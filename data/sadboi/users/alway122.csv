1) how long it took the onset 

2) the obscurity of drugs that are both sedating and psychedelic

3) people who use drugs don't want to give them away for free, especially during quarantine

Def not trying to dismiss the thought entirely, drugs like that exist and some people might be doing some crazy stuff having been locked up for so long. What this sounds like it could be, is possibly edible marijuana. That would be a very long onset but it's known for that, though I've never personally heard of it taking 6-7 hours. Edible marijuana is widely available so of all drugs to give away, it seems the most likely one. It can be rather sedating and last many hours.

Issues with this: 

1) edible marijuana doesn't commonly cause itching 

2) more often makes you not have dreams by preventing REM sleep rather than giving more vivid dreams

3) open eyed visual hallucinations through edible marijuana would probably be accompanied by stronger effects of other kinds that I'd expect to hear you mention, as it usually results from relatively large dosages, if at all

4) edible marijuana typically lasts 4-6 hours or even longer in large doses, like those that would typically produce open eyed visual effects. 

Is it possible you were experiencing effects before the itching and didn't notice? It sounds silly but powerful drug experiences can make you not realize you are experiencing effects by affecting your perception of sobriety, particularly when you aren't expecting to consume drugs."

My closest friends are one buddy from hs, one from church in high school, and a group of friends I met at college who graduated but stayed in the area. I haven't really made new friends in a few years."

Psychedelics,fq9yxeq,t3_gho4j9,1589209748.0,"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. These people seem like obvious scams, whether law enforcement honeypots or someone just trying to rip you off. Seems like they troll through pages psychedelic users would follow and add everyone.

I'd just block them. Even if there's a few genuine sources there, it's not worth the risk of it being a cop. Not to mention anyone selling in that method is probably really sketchy to begin with, regardless of their intentions."

NoStupidQuestions,fq9ye2m,t3_ghnjlo,1589209457.0,"This has been ""normal"" inside of my life as I often only have a small number of friends I feel completely comfortable with, who are often older and not in school with me. So especially during school time I have very few friends and my girlfriend at the time is usually my best friend. This ended up being a really unhealthy relationship dynamic for me that kept me in bad relationships longer than I should've been in them. I think this goes okay as long as your relationship is good, but it's likely somewhat unhealthy which becomes more apparent if issues in that one relationship are present. 

But that's just my view, obviously shaped by my experience. Definitely not trying to prescribe anything about your relationship. But I think having make friends is pretty important."
