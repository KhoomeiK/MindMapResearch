My current partner was the only person that helped me out of my abusive situation, while everyone else just distanced themselves leaving me even more isolated (I wasn't even allowed to mention I was in a poly relationship even after being with my now ex-girlfriend (and abuser) for years. Her and my ex-wife were basically the only people I had in my life because my friends all distanced themselves so I was only left with my two abusers. All my current partner had to do was tell me that he noticed some troubling behaviors from them and it all came pouring out. I finally felt like I wasn't crazy and I realized I wasn't the only one to see/think something was wrong.  

It just seems like I can't count on anyone other than my mom, sister, and partner to help me when I need it. Everyone else is saying now to just let them know if I need any help or anything, but all I keep thinking is that help would have been nice a few years back when I was being abused by two people. I was suicidal and I was starting to make plans, if it wasn't for my current partner and I relied on my friends, I would probably be dead or would have been hospitalized and sent back to my abusive situation."

Paranormal,fqm61e3,t1_fqm1l73,1589472106.0,"Pentagrams are usually not bad, but in places like that, people who are novices or people who practice black magic may go to haunted locations to try to conjure not so nice things. This can be on purpose, but also if they didn't cast a protective circle, or if they didn't know what they were doing, they might have conjured or awakened something evil. Heck, it could have been there beforehand due to some of the things that happened there and the pentagram may be a protective thing. 

Many people see anything that is related to witchcraft and think that it is clearly evil, but that really isn't the case. Pentagrams were a Christian symbol (for the five wounds of Christ) and now is a pagan symbol that symbolizes the five elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Spirit or by Taoists to symbolize their five elements: Earth, Water, Wood, Fire, and Metal. Satanists use an inverted one to be the sigil of Baphomet, but most Satanists are Atheists and don't believe in Satan or demons either. People often misunderstand this symbol and it probably has little to nothing to do with the growling or the presence."

We know that vaccines DO NOT cause Autism and the benefits outweigh the risks. I think we should always be working to make vaccines, medications, and treatments safer, but it is way better to have immunity for life threatening illnesses then to have them killing people throughout our communities.  

With all that said, I do love natural remedies and they are perfectly useful for certain ailments/conditions like ginger is great for nausea or my sulphur soap is great for my tinea versicolor (a type of fungal skin infection) or that St. John's Wort can be useful in the treatment of mild to moderate depression (there have been actual scientific studies on this).

She is a dom though, so she wants to dom my partner. Well, she starts literally punching him in the butt hard, no warning, no warmup, which really hurt.  The other lady also bit my partner's neck hard enough that she drew blood (this is a hard no for us) and also caused nerve damage to that area.

genderqueer,fplomhy,t3_ge3pih,1588716531.0,"Hey, it sounds to me that you are most likely masculine of center (due to the fact it seems like you lean towards a more masculine identity) and possibly a little gender fluid (maybe non-binary). With that being said, only you can really figure out what fits you and your experiences best. It takes some time to figure out how you are comfortable identifying, what pronouns to use, and how you like to present. Take your time, do your research, and in time you will find what fits. 

In the mean-time I have a couple of ideas that might help. First is to buy a binder to try (you may have to keep this at somebody else's house or in a hiding spot in your car to hide it) and try it on in private and you can maybe work on wearing it in front of some people you are comfortable with and see how you feel. I know this may not be an option depending on your life situations, so you have to figure out if you can safely do that. Remember it is fine to stay in the closet as long as you need. Second: Coming out is for you, when you are ready and able to deal with the possible back-lash, you can come out then. Don't let anyone pressure you to do something you aren't ready for. Third: When you do come to the point of possibly going on T, remember, you need to make that decision for you, not your boyfriend. If that is a problem, it may end the relationship, but you need to be you at the end of the day.  Fourth: Use whatever pronouns that you are comfortable with and remember, these may change over time as you go through your own searching and discovering for your gender identity. These don't even have to ""match up"" with whatever gender identity you end up using (for example a man can use she/her if that is what makes her comfortable). Fifth: Your presentation doesn't have to match up with your identity either. I am a non-binary androgynous person and I generally present pretty feminine and there is nothing wrong with that. 

I wish you all the best and remember, you are part of a loving and vibrant community whether you are out or still in the closet! We are here for you!"

Feelings do come up sometimes and it is really important to discuss them and work through them with your partner. Maybe it's just the novelty of someone new (this is usually the case), but it may be deeper. If it is deeper, you might have to make some decisions.  Maybe you need to cut things off from this person, maybe you and your partner should consider if polyamory is a possibility for you two, or maybe you need to question if swinging is for you at all if you can't swing without developing feelings.

Swingers,fnpl093,t3_g34j5h,1587147349.0,"First off, I'm guessing you mean transgender people not transexual people. Transgender people are people who identify with a gender other than the one assigned to them at birth. Transexual was a term they used to use for this back in the day,  (the term was created in 1949, but wasn't popularized until the late 60s people started using the term transgender in the 90s) and is considered to be a slur to many trans folks these days, so I wouldn't use it  refer to someone unless they ask you to refer to them that way. Also , I'm guessing you mean male to female transgender folks, they are women, not men.  A good rule of thumb is to respect people's identities and pronouns. 

With all that said, you are under no obligation to sleep with anyone male, female, non-binary folks, ect. if you aren't interested in them. All consent needs to be enthusiastic, or it's not really consent. You can discuss with her that you aren't attracted to these women (although I personally believe that pretty much anyone attracted to women will find at least some trans women attractive) and you can't fulfill this fantasy for her."
genderqueer,fnpcj5g,t3_g33hwc,1587143105.0,"No one can tell you if you are genderqueer or not, that is something only you can really know. Sometimes it takes a long time to find out what fits right. That being said, it sounds like non-binary may be fitting for you with your life experiences, but I'm just an outsider looking in. Take your time and explore your gender, do some reading, and find what fits you. For pronouns, you can use just one set or multiple and they don't have to match your presentation either. Which one/ones feel best for you? You should go by whatever pronouns you are most comfortable with. 

I am AFAB, but I identify as androgynous, but masculine of center and I use she/he/they. Whatever your gender identity ends up being, your presentation doesn't  have to match up with your gender identity. You should wear what makes you feel good. As far as binders go and not being able to attain one, you may want to look for a sports bra, which seems pretty ""normal"" and would be easier to obtain. There are some sports bras that will hold down your breasts and make them look flatter."
sex,fnp2jqt,t3_g2yess,1587138113.0,"It is a myth that women aren't as interested in sex in men and society has gone back and forth throughout time whether they thought of women as seductresses just trying to lead men astray and them being totally uninterested in sex. Women are sexual beings, just like men. How do you think the human population has stayed around, just men having sex (raping) unwilling women? If women never wanted sex, then every sexual encounter with a woman would be assault. 

There is also the issue of slut-shaming if women are at all open about their sexuality and desires. I was called a slut so many times (starting around 10) even before I had ever had kissed anyone, held hands, or even had a boyfriend, girlfriend, or partner. I was called a slut back when I was wearing monkey t-shirts and baggy jeans as a kid. I learned early on that sexuality was something you didn't talk about and I felt guilty about having sexual feelings for many years."

The nice thing about witchcraft is that it is all about intention and it can be molded to fit what you believe and what works for you. I hate the whole gender role thing, especially cause I am non-binary and I realize that the traditional gender roles are total crap and have way more to do with how people are socialized to act. 

One really nice thing about pagans, though, is there is a lot more LGBTQ+ folks in the community and many of us don't like the whole gender role thing. You just have to find the right people."
CPTSD,fnor365,t3_g2nkp9,1587131896.0,"I find this to be the case too. The thing is though, most people don't know how to help people deal with trauma. They don't know what to do when they hear about such horrible things happening to someone they care about. Others will see it as repetitive or annoying because many think it is a just a plea for attention because they don't understand anything about trauma. I think for most people they don't really fully understand it and they don't know how to approach it because they have no context. Someone who has never been traumatized isn't going to fully understand the full impact that it has on your life.

She apologizes profusely and sulks because she doesn't want to deal with the consequences of her shitty behavior. She WILL keep doing this. The only question is when. She may put it off for a while because she is getting punished, but I really doubt it. 

You need to break things off with her because she will keep doing this to you over and over. You sound like you are at a point where you can't take much more, but it seems that she only cares about herself. She doesn't care about how much you are hurting, she just doesn't want punishment.

AmItheAsshole,fnhk0ka,t3_g1n11p,1586963825.0,"NTA- RN here, using harsh chemicals near your crotch/butt is very bad for you. These chemicals can ruin your microbiome causing things like yeast infections, but they also can burn the skin and cause permanent skin damage. Best case scenario, it dries out her skin and irritates it. She absolutely should not continue to do this and there are some reasonable remedies if she doesn't feel clean after toilette paper. 

First option you mentioned was a bidet and for the record they are affordable (some are more expensive than others, but some are like $20) and relatively easy to install and to take off when you move. Second option is using some baby wipes or perineal care (pericare) cloths (essentially adult baby wipes). They aren't great for the environment and shouldn't be flushed though. It is much more reasonable then wiping with something that isn't meant for human skin."

I don't want to be ""that adult"", but  you are young and the chances of you meeting your soulmate at that age are slim. The person you are at 15 is going to be very different than the person you are as an adult, same for him. Your brains aren't even finished developing yet. When I was 15, I was a evangelical christian who went to church twice a week, ate meat, identified as straight, liked the republican party, ect. Now at 33 I am an atheist witch who doesn't attend church, a vegetarian, and I like the green party best. The boy I thought was my soulmate at the time is now a christian pastor and I'm really glad I didn't end up with him. Things change, people change, especially during adolescence and young adulthood.

Give yourself some time and space and just leave it for a while, I'm talking at least months. Spend some time with yourself, or heck, get to know some new people.  I think you will find that you will move on and fall in love again."

Swingers,fndwt45,t3_g12wmq,1586878954.0,"So I am a AFAB pansexual NB person who has been swinging for about 13 years now (weird that I have been swinging that long, lol). I have only had swinging experiences in the US, but have done so in Connecticut, Louisiana, and Oregon.

1. People don't care about safety as much as they should. Very rarely do people care about STI testing and I can't tell you how many people in the community who have tried to get us to agree to no condoms.
2. Many people get nervous with the first few encounters. Many men have a hard time getting/maintaining erections especially at first and many use viagra to remedy this.
3. I mean it is hard to lay down ""facts"" because everyone in the community is different, but I have noticed some common things that happen. The biggest negative for me is that the community tends to be MF couples where the male is straight and the female is bi and everything ends up being about pleasing the men, even women playing together seems to be for men's entertainment rather than the women's sexual satisfaction. Second thing is that single men tend to not be respectful and are generally super-pushy, so while there are tons of single males in the community, it has been near impossible to find one that respects boundaries. Third is that there is a limited age range of people depending on where you are. The other places I have lived pretty much everyone in the community was over the age of 45, which didn't work out when I was in my 20's swinging (sorry, but I am just not attracted to people that are much more than 10 years older). In Oregon though, there are people in the community in more age groups. Generally they are in their 20s-60s here, so it gives me more options for people in my age group."

He also may have even seen your message, got distracted, and then forgot to respond at a later time. Who knows? Life gets in the way sometimes. If he doesn't respond, then maybe things fizzled out for him for whatever reason. With online dating, it is common for you to talk to someone for a while and then they ghost you for one reason or another. It is part of it and you rarely (if ever) figure out why they stopped responding. Don't take it personally and don't get too attached to people before you meet up. I can't tell you how many times this has happened to me and you just have to say, ""oh well,"" and move on. 

My suggestion for online dating is to throw a wide net and see what comes up. Don't limit yourself to one person before you even have gone on a date. Talk to multiple people and see what sticks."

Not everyone is sympathetic/empathetic when they see scars, but many are. Some people, like myself, recognize them and don't mention them (because I don't know if that is a triggering subject for them and I know not everyone will want to talk to me about something so personal), so even if someone sees them and doesn't say anything, doesn't mean they don't care either. 

The best way to combat this, I have found, is to build up a social circle for yourself and to get counseling and talk about things.

It is hard to know what to say to someone you care about when they start down-talking themselves. Your first instinct is to try to help/cheer them up somehow. 

For the record, while women vary immensely, culturally speaking (at least here in the US) women tend to be way more gracious about looks in dating then men are (I have been in serious and casual relationships with both men and women). Even if that wasn't the case not all men and not all women are that big on looks and everyone has a different opinion as to what makes someone attractive or unattractive. 

A lot of people who have ""given up"" on dating because they are ""too ugly"" I find usually have become undateable because of one or a combination of the following reasons: 1. they really aren't nice people and just think that they are nice, 2. they see themselves as ugly, but are totally unwilling to date people who are on the same ""attractiveness level"" as themselves, 3. are totally self-deprecating to their prospective partner (this is really uncomfortable and a big turn off), or 4. they keep going for the same person/people who aren't interested instead of moving on."

I never reported it to authorities (I told my ex-wife about it, but she defended her and is now engaged to my abuser), so I never testified or talked to police or anything. First off, you need to protect and take care of yourself first and you need to do whatever is best for you. This may be taking this the full way by pursuing it legally as far as you can, or it may be to just get the counseling/help you need and working towards healing, it may be something in between. Do what is best for you.

The thing I regret most about the abuse is that I kept protecting my abuser instead of myself. I stayed with this person for 4 years, I would sugar coat the abuse she put me through when I did actually attempt to talk to her about it, and I never told her what she actually is, my rapist. Years later, I am still having dreams of finally telling her/confronting her. I protected her and her feelings instead of my physical and emotional well-being. 

The first step would be trying to figure out (possibly with the help of a therapist) what would be best for you.  Once you figure out what is the best course of action is for you, pursue that and protect yourself instead of protecting you abuser."

Our brains is where our true selves are and once that's dead, many believe that we are just not there anymore. Like blowing out a flame. Some believe we may go on in some way. I personally lean towards what I call ""cosmic reincarnation"" because I personally think that there  is a good possiblity that there are infinite universes and if that is the case every possible reality is in one of these universes. If that is the case we will come back in ways in other universes. That is really my extent for my theories, but I accept that I am possibly wrong on that too. lol.

First, it is important to cleanse the skin regularly so that you don't end up having skin irritation and break down. Not to mention letting stuff build up can make someone more susceptible to skin infections and urinary tract infections. If I, as a nurse, let a client/resident/patient without bathing and not taking action, I could get in trouble for neglect. She is neglecting herself and not being considerate of you. People who don't bathe often get used to their smell, but people around them sure can smell them. 

She should be bathing at least 2 times a week to help maintain skin heath. If you don't shower enough you can have a build up of dirt, dead skin cells, dried sweat, and a overgrowth of bad bacteria that can upset your skin's normal flora.
