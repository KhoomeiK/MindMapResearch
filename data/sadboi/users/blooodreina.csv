He was also super funny and cute and silky and we spent so many nights and days happy and laughing and doing stupid things together. I miss that. I don’t miss him hurting me and lying to me and yelling at me.

If we fought he would say he doesn’t care he can get as many girls as he wants, they’ll just flock to him.

He would also talk about how smart he is all the time or how hard working or basically anything positive he could wether or not it’s true."

It all blew up 2 weeks ago when he physically, verbally and mentally abused me. I couldn’t take it anymore and made a huge mistake (calling 911) now I lost my home, my boyfriend, my job, my new friends and new town. I had to move back across the country in with my mom. My ex hates me and won’t forgive me. It was my birthday yesterday and I spent it alone. 
I spent a year building a life with someone that was ripped away from me in an instant.

He’s happy and had a girl he was talking to behind my back at OUR house 2 days later. I honestly don’t have the will to live anymore. I don’t know what the point is. 

Some pictures I took of myself to try and feel a bit better on my birthday ... it didn’t really help lol.

We dated for like 5-6 months and worked together. His cousin who was more like his father found something out about us and hated me and “forced him to break up with me” (we were 18/19 so, young but still ridiculous to force that on us) he was cold and mean about it and instantly went for another girl at work. I was extremely crushed and fought hard to get him back but it didn’t work.

I googled everything about getting an ex back. I even did a magic spell 😂😂 I found on tumblr. 

But what actually worked was ignoring him, acting super happy and moved on. In real life and online. I could clearly see this messed with him and hurt him and he came running back.
I wouldn’t be mean but I would act indifferent and friendly but short.

This also worked without trying for an ex after him. I broke up with him and felt no remorse because he was a bad boyfriend at the end of the relationship but he still called me randomly even a year after it ended asking for me back while he was in another relationship and I said no. 

Acting indifferent and happy and cold without someone will almost always make them want you."
