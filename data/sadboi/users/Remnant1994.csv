I‚Äôm baptized Roman Catholic and have fallen away from the church for various reasons, so currently don‚Äôt know where my path is going to lead me... I have this intense pulling to find my roots though, where I come from and where my ancestors lived. Not putting much stock in the AncestryDNA test I did, but with half of my genetic makeup from Poland and around 9% from the England/wales region, I‚Äôd love to delve deeper into the Celtic side of my family (if there is such) but barely any trails to follow on my grandfathers side (who was quite genetically made up of English/welsh area as well as Scottish/Irish) that probably made no sense, but it‚Äôs this weird ancestral call I feel and have no idea where to begin!"
