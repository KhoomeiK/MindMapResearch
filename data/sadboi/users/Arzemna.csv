Landlords may not take the law into their own hands and evict a tenant by use of force or unlawful means. 


The only real question you’ll have to potential ask is if you want to risk more by staying (they can’t evict right now but they can seek damages after) or if you break the lease and either you find someone to take over or they eventually retentions it in a couple of months and you are only potentially only responsible for those couple of months

3 And when the disciples had come with bread and wine, he took of the bread and brake and blessed it; and he gave unto the disciples and commanded that they should eat.

5 And when the multitude had eaten and were filled, he said unto the disciples: Behold there shall one be ordained among you, and to him will I give power that he shall break bread and bless it and give it unto the people of my church, unto all those who shall believe and be baptized in my name.

6 And this shall ye always observe to do, even as I have done, even as I have broken bread and blessed it and given it unto you.

2. Not Dialing in to a blessing is a tradition we do out of respect and reverence. 

They are different

The real question is.  For the ordinance of sacrament what is the doctrine

The closest I came up with is that Christ bless and then broke the bread.  But no where does it say in our scripture that the priesthood holder must “hold” the bread or be within sight etc..  in fact reading above we are doing it wrong by breaking it before we bless it. 

The real discussion should not be how you feel but what is doctrine and correct.

latterdaysaints,fk2mp3o,t1_fk2bp7a,1583804401.0,"Ok. Was just wondering AEDs are designed to be used by anyone. 

Kind of like a fire extinguisher (I know bad example but you get the idea)

They are big on saving the life of a cardiac arrest person as their usage in those first few minutes after make the difference. 

I know they are a little expensive (~2k) but sounds like at least there has been some discussion  on it."

latterdaysaints,fjxygha,t3_ffa5u0,1583686211.0,"Just my personal boundaries 

1. It’s about helping people come into Christ. If the conversation is not around that then it’s not worth it. 

If I feel like the person has genuine questions or discussions OR if I feel like misinformation needs to be corrected based on doctrine so someone in the future seeing it will be able to see what is correct. 

2. It’s always based on Scripture, never about some obscure source or book. That’s just asking to chase rabbits. We’ve been wanted to keep doctrine pure and that’s in the scripture.  I’ll never try to get into to any discussions online regarding other things except to correct the false doctrine these other sources might give. 

Apart from that, it’s not worth it. I Keep in mind that it’s still about missionary work and helping those who might see or read that small bit of truth that might want to lead them to learn more"
latterdaysaints,fjt5yc8,t1_fjqp1wn,1583604501.0,"And that is the same cycle we ran into with Mormon doctrine and journal of discourses. 

It’s ok to read them and seek for all good things but it all still needs to be based on scripture, especially over the pulpit and in class

latterdaysaints,fjp9eu5,t3_femffi,1583545092.0,"Personally those old books have a very little doctrinal value. 

Stick to the scriptures.  

I think recently there has been a big push to step away from those books as sources. Especially those 2 you mentioned. (JoD and MD)"
