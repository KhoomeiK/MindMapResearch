Shiv shenanigans, discard, poison...my ideal poison cards for a run would be [[bouncing flask]], [[crippling cloud]], [[noxious fumes]], [[Sadistic Nature]] and [[catalyst]]. [[Nightmare]] with catalyst or [[burst]] with bouncing flask are amazing, too. [[Well Laid Plans]] for set-ups with that catalyst. There are relics like [[Snecko Skull]] and [[The Specimen]] that make life easier.

In general, it's a good idea to get draw and defensive cards on her too, like [[footwork]], [[backflip]], [[piercing wail]], [[Malaise]] in any build.

Shiv builds go great with relics like [[kunai]], [[shuriken]], anything that procs on attack. Envenom is good with shivs, so is [[After Image]], [[choke]], [[The Boot]].
