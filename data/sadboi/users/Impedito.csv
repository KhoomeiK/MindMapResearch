I kept a notebook next to me and scrolled the the 'edit deck' page for my main climbing deck. I would write down different meta decks and then underneath I would write ""Tips"" and ""Mulligan Strats""  

For example, for my Ice Spider deck, I would write ""Against aggro (mulligan can win or lose you the game, go for low cost units like Hapless Aristrocrat,  Arachnid Horror, Vile Feast and Brood Awakening. And next to the cards I would write WHY they were useful. For example, Vile feast is great for the 2/1 burn chick. Not only does it heal her damage fully, but it kills her.  

I would also write down tips and win conditions for each of these decks. 

I would do this with every single matchup. That way once i get into the mulligan screen i was able to develop a strategy and this has led me to a 78.8% WR in Diamond. You can do it man, just be confident and always think ahead."
