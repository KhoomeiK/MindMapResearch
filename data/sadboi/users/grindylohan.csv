TooAfraidToAsk,fcn4lta,t3_ehrok6,1577803117.0,"Honestly feel the same. I hate being around children, I don’t understand when my friends ask me to come over and “hang out” when it’s constantly distracted by their child. It leaves me feeling like I can’t relate to them, and the conversations with my friends with children usually end up about their kids or their spouses not doing enough, or how they can’t wait to get away. It’s discouraging and I find myself pulling away or ignoring texts altogether when it’s about kids."

depression,fb19kgw,t3_cml6ni,1576433790.0,Feeling bad for myself because I’m an ugly fucking woman. Been sitting at work for the last two hours without a single soul coming through the door so I’m just here with my thoughts and not able to text friends about how ugly I feel. They’ll tell me otherwise but I know the fucking truth. I’m just my father with a scraggly wig on. I’m ugly as all fuck and it only goes downhill from here. I wish I could close my eyes and my life would blip out of existence.

I managed to spend too much money on weed and whatever I didn’t account for so now my bank account will be hit with an overdraft fee. It’ll be fine, I know this rationally, but I’m 28 and I don’t make enough money for my lifestyle. It’s like my addictive qualities are the Midas touch for shit(if that makes sense.) I’m having a bit of a shame spiral I guess. I have a bad habit of avoiding looking at my bank account and it’s bitten me in the ass—AGAIN! It’s been at least a year or so since I’ve done this, but still. I hate it, it makes me feel even more like a mess.

I’ve been going to therapy for a few years now, on lexapro 20mg for probably a little over a year and I’m thinking of going to my doctor about a higher dosage.  My sobriety keeps going on thin ice and I can’t seem to function without comparing myself to others. Probably something I need to address with my therapist, obviously. I just keep getting distracted and having bad days with intrusive thoughts. Right now I’m checking in to distract myself from IG. I feel so useless with no motivation. Lots of wishful thinking but no action. I don’t know. I just don’t feel like ‘enough’, I desperately wish I had confidence. I wish I knew who I was. I’m 28 and I suck."
