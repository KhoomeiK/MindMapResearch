BipolarReddit,fo474b5,t3_g5jr0y,1587499330.0,My story is almost identical to yours. I went off my meds for a full year after I turned 18 and ended up needing to see a dr again. The only office near me as several different doctors but I’d never seen a single one that didn’t immediately want to hospitalize me over the smallest things. I went in for my first appointment with the dr I see now and he done the same thing so I walked out. My therapist convinced me to go back after she talked to him and I finally told him I wasn’t doing this trial crap anymore and that if they thought I was depressed than I’d gladly take the antidepressants but they could take me off mood stabilizers and if they wanted to diagnose me with bipolar than they could stop the antidepressants and I’d do a mood stabilizer. I was sick of feeling like a guinea pig! He talked to me a while and between what I was saying asks what my therapist told him he decided to take a chance and just give me mood stabilizers for 30 days and see how it went. After that month I felt better than I have in years! He changed my diagnosis and I haven’t heard a word about antidepressants from him since. It was amazing
insomnia,fn8dacb,t3_fzvh4o,1586739086.0,Wish I’d have found this post months so when I decided to be an idiot and tell the doctor I’d fought for. 11 years about my sleep that I was having to take more than 1 10mg ambien a night to sleep and it still didn’t work which was causing my anxiety to go through the roof so i was taking .5mg Xanax several times a day to function and mother my kid. He took me off of everything but a mood stabilizer and told me I needed to be hospitalized. I don’t see him anymore but I’m still not sleeping and now I’m screwed with anxiety too. So ya know. Don’t do that
BipolarReddit,fm67swx,t1_fm2tdrw,1585788115.0,Thank you!
BipolarReddit,fm67sbe,t1_fm5pj4b,1585788106.0,I went and got paint tonight so me and my little one could make a mess! Thanks for that idea I have a lot to clean but we had a blast.
BipolarReddit,fktum3s,t3_fko2b1,1584535058.0,I’m on Medicaid and I’ve never had a doctor talk to me about it. In emergency settings people will sometimes look at me funny but never in the mental health field. That’s seems strange to me. The receptionist will ask if I’m still receiving Medicaid but that’s it
BipolarReddit,fktl7c5,t3_fkjk0t,1584524923.0,My biological  dad is bipolar. He’s also just a shitty human and *lucky me* it was the only thing I got from the bastard. It scares me because I have a daughter now and I wouldnt wish this on anyone honestly.
Miscarriage,fiwn9zc,t3_fa5x39,1582793446.0,"I had a few of those thoughts to. I have an almost 2 year old and some days I was excited to see her be a big sister and some days I wanted to let her be a only baby for a little longer. Then I started to feel like something was wrong... and next thing I knew it was confirmed I had a missed miscarriage. I think it’s normal to not be over the moon at first simply because it’s such an over whelming feeling. I remember thinking the same things when i got pregnant the first time and we’d tried for 3 years. I’d spent so many hours crying and wanting a baby, then all of a sudden I had it and I was terrified. Try not to beat yourself up too much. I keep telling myself that my hesitation was my brains way of trying to protect me. I’m so sorry you’re going through this."
Miscarriage,fivkeog,t3_f9z2yu,1582762070.0,So so sorry. 💔
Miscarriage,fiqr5nh,t1_fiqarkr,1582650211.0,I’m more mad about the fact that my mental health suffered. This whole time I thought my anxiety was bad.. but nope I was right.
adorableoldpeople,fim48bh,t3_f8jjhe,1582517716.0,I’d give just about anything to be able to call my papa right now. 😩 they’re the best
Miscarriage,filzdej,t1_filz4p8,1582514078.0,"I’m going to call in the morning. I’m not using pads because I can’t stand them so instead I got adult diapers. And since they’re made to hold urine I’m not sure how much they’ll actually hold. But I do know if I stand up without anything to catch it it runs down my legs and puddles. And I’m so extremely tired, and I get light headed if I stand up too fast. Its worse now than it was to begin with. But I’m definitely calling in the morning"
Miscarriage,filych1,t1_filxwcw,1582513335.0,I was in the tub and had to flush it. Because I didn’t know what else to do. I’m processing it pretty good aside from that. I’m also worrying about my health some at this point because I’m bleeding extremely bad and is concerning. I feel like it’s never ending
Miscarriage,filk46e,t1_filjxjt,1582503444.0,Thank you. So much ❤️❤️
Miscarriage,filgdgj,t3_f83ttd,1582500971.0,I don’t post on social media but I complain about parenting not even because I want to vent but because I want others to know it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. I wish it was but it’s not. I’m not even a week past mc yet... and I still want my friends with kids to feel okay to rant and rave to me about the hardest parts because I want them to know they aren’t alone. Just like people in here vent about their losses. We want to know we aren’t alone. Doesn’t matter what the struggle is everyone deserves to know they aren’t the only one going through it.
Miscarriage,filfnht,t3_f8ex4b,1582500496.0,I don’t have many word of wisdom nor do I know what to say to help get through everything. But as hard as it’s going to be do ask what you’re going to pass will look like. I was in the bathtub and had no clue what it was I passed.. so I had to take pictures and send them to a family member to ask for advice. So even if you don’t think you’ll need to know. ASK

Miscarriage,fi7uo7q,t1_fi6meh5,1582228494.0,I’m doing as well as I can. Thank you
Miscarriage,fi5tskf,t1_fi5mrr2,1582170468.0,I agree. I’m through the hardest part now. Idk if you seen my other comments. And I guess maybe spiritual is a better word for me than religious as well. And I agree.
Miscarriage,fi5tnmi,t1_fi5rc63,1582170390.0,Thank you for listening to my panic tmi story. I was concerned. I’m through the worst of it now it seems. Never even got to take the medication.
Miscarriage,fi5ra4x,t1_fi5r4i6,1582168975.0,I’m in the tub so I had no choice and I’m confused. They didn’t tell me what to look for. I do know my water broke and I was having contractions. Pains subsided now
Miscarriage,fi5r2f5,t1_fi5qd5l,1582168849.0,I know this isn’t the place for this necessarily but I just passed something HUGE and idk what it is
Miscarriage,fi5kcsv,t1_fi5dp2i,1582164993.0,"I feel like that to. But then I remember that it would have only made things worse for me. Just because there wasn’t that strong connection doesn’t mean we didn’t love them any less. I was only 7 weeks when baby passed but I truly think I was having a boy too. 
I was lucky enough to have a daughter here with me. She’s not even two yet and she’s helped me a lot. I know it sounds insane but I’ve managed to find several silver linings somehow. I also am religious so I’m able to hold on to that. We all have something to anchor us and help us through dark times regardless of what that is. Definitely use that and lean into it for as long as you have to."
Miscarriage,fi5dd0s,t1_fi5cx15,1582160557.0,I’m so sorry for your loss. I feel like I’m a monster in a way because today I’ve kind of realized that I knew something was off from the beginning. I just felt off... so I put some kind of distance between me and the baby to protect myself because I felt this coming. So I’ve essentially already mourned the loss and now I’m just waiting things out. I went to the doctor today and he gave me medication to take to help me pass everything. And I think I’m going to be able to begin the process of healing as soon as that happens. Granted I’m still upset and it hurts and I wish so much that i was wrong and my anxiety was getting the better of me but that’s not what it was. I almost have a weird relief because now I know I’m not crazy and I can trust my instincts more than I thought I could. I hope you’re able to find some kind of peace
Miscarriage,fi5bxs6,t1_fi4slvq,1582159591.0,I’m so sorry. I’m starting to realize im truly still fortunate. I’m a SAHM. My mom came and got my daughter today and is keeping her until Saturday.  I’m truly sorry
Miscarriage,fi4rz8b,t1_fi4ru8w,1582147265.0,I’ve already carried so long without knowing that it scared me to wait any longer honestly. Plus part of me wants that part over with so I don’t have to think about it happening so much
Miscarriage,fi4kt84,t1_fi3xfxn,1582143186.0,"They gave me medicine. 💔 
Well it was either take the medicine or wait it out and that seemed worse. So please send prayers/thoughts/whatever your preferences are please."
Miscarriage,fi472nq,t1_fi3dv24,1582135278.0,Thank you 💔
Miscarriage,fi46zt7,t1_fi4401v,1582135232.0,I’ve known for a long time something was off but I hadn’t seen my ob yet to discuss anything. They were making me go through my health department and I was not given proper care in my opinion. They done blood work after the baby passed and still no one caught anything. I feel more let down by my medical team than my body. I hope you’re able to find peace as well.
Miscarriage,fi3zaee,t1_fi3xfxn,1582130771.0,I have an appointment with my OB at 1:30
Miscarriage,fi3xdwn,t1_fi36e06,1582129654.0,I’m not sure if they’d allow him to make any appointments or not. We’re not married and my obgyn is picky
Miscarriage,fi3xag9,t1_fi3wr6e,1582129597.0,I don’t know if I could handle that mentally. I don’t know what to do or where to go from here honestly
AskReddit,fh3zzvs,t3_f18upu,1581273977.0,For me a lot of it was spite. I knew too many people that truly believed it would be what ended me and I’m just too damn stubborn to let anyone be right. Helped me out in the end because I’m 25 with a daughter a bonus kid and a kid on the way. I couldn’t imagine leaving them.
AskReddit,feip5nk,t1_feip1jp,1579143765.0,Monday morning church hurts me mainly because it reminds me of my grandma and grandpa. We lost him October 2018. He was my best friend so everything that makes me think of him hurts so bad
AskReddit,feiepzo,t1_feie17y,1579136788.0,It’s pretty religious. But it’s sad as hell
AskReddit,feieoy1,t3_ep7tm4,1579136768.0,"Currently I’m not dead by boy in a band is a big one 


But most of mine are country. 

Alan Jackson- Monday morning church
Johnny cash- Hurt
Matt Kennon- glad you called
Blaine Larsen- how do you get that lonely


Nickelback- lullaby
Kid rock- blue jeans and a rosary
Those are just because I lost someone very close and we listened to those a lot."

AskReddit,fdlw414,t1_fdk8j7u,1578533917.0,I like a lot of the newer little blind bag collectibles like shopkins and the sparkly critter things are fun to collect. I have a bunch of them! I was always so self conscious about going in the toy aisle to pick something out. Then I got pregnant and had a little girl so now I get fewer weird looks even though she’s not 2 yet. I don’t really care much anymore I like to collect them so I buy them. It’s fun to open blind bags and hopefully get new figures.
DannyGonzalez,fcmdftd,t3_ehrql3,1577771333.0,I mentioned this story to someone a few years back and no one remembered it so I was convinced I’d made it up until Danny confirmed it did in fact exist.
JUSTNOMIL,fc6mn8a,t1_fc5hhri,1577484183.0,I mean this in the sweetest way I possibly can as her daughter. I don’t think she’s so much a narcissist as she is plain old stupid. I could be wrong though. She’s ignoring me so it doesn’t matter
legaladvice,fc6maf1,t1_fc6m8ii,1577483933.0,That’s what I thought but I wasn’t 100% sure. Thank you.

JUSTNOMIL,fc6g19k,t1_fc6f876,1577479710.0,"Thank you. I’m gonna see what I can find out on my own and if I reach a dead end I’ll contact sheriffs office.

Edit: posted on legaladvice about what the laws here are in these situations. 
Long story short bf isn’t on probation so there’s no laws saying he can’t be around minors. Which is what I thought but I wasn’t sure."
JUSTNOMIL,fc6e2qd,t1_fc6dvwr,1577478384.0,I tried to do research and from what I’ve seen it doesn’t look like that’s the case here. I don’t really know what to look up or got to word it though. I’ve thought about asking legaladvice but haven’t gotten around to it yet.
JUSTNOMIL,fc6b99l,t1_fc675cg,1577476547.0,Dude. This guy isn’t on probation or parole AFAIK. so he can be near anyone he wants too be near.

I somehow managed to cope, maybe not properly because I blocked it all out. The rape has come back hard since all of this."
JUSTNOMIL,fc4q857,t1_fc4p7wd,1577424491.0,Never will understand how people can risk children around them on the off chance someone’s innocent. My moms loves to say she’s known her bf for YEARS and she’s never known him to do anything like that. Pretty sure no one ever expected Ted Bundy to be as horrible as he was either but it didn’t change him being guilty.
JUSTNOMIL,fc4q3i3,t1_fc4oyue,1577424370.0,"I’m almost convinced that I could handle this all better if it wasn’t for these god forsaken pregnancy hormones! This isn’t the first time she’s picked some dude over me and I’ve never been shy about telling her to piss off. So I’m pretty sure this baby’s making me a complete emotional disaster! But then again seeing how much DD loves her doesn’t help either. Not 2 years into being a mom I’ve already learned it’s not slays possible to give your babies the perfect happy family. 
Good things came out of everything that I’ve endured. I never learned to be a perfect mom but I’ve learned how to be a terrible one so I’ll always know how to avoid that."
JUSTNOMIL,fc4ouw9,t1_fc4o1n1,1577423204.0,I agree. If she wants to see her bad enough she can come to us with out him. Or meet us at my grandmas without him. I’m getting to the point where if people can’t respect my decision to protect my kid then they don’t need to see her either.
JUSTNOMIL,fc4oqfp,t1_fc4neyf,1577423088.0,"I agree. 
Let’s play devils advocate for a moment and say moms bf didn’t do anything and he was in fact set up as he claims. Idk exactly how the law works with these things and I don’t think there’s probation/parole in place. But I can’t imagine it’d be legal for her to be around him and if they hated him enough to frame him for something as huge as rape, they’d call the law on us for having DD around him too and it’s not worth it to me. No one seems to understand why I’m being the way I am and it’s so infuriating. The risks that come with trusting him and being wrong are 100% not worth it. Period."
JUSTNOMIL,fc4ob3h,t1_fc4m1fj,1577422698.0,My state has strict laws on GPR. Even if she could I highly doubt she would because 1) that’d be expensive and she couldn’t afford it and 2) she doesn’t care enough clearly. There’s also the whole registered sec offender thing that the judge would probably laugh her out of the court room over
JUSTNOMIL,fc4ixyv,t1_fc4iehq,1577418000.0,I am very lucky in the SO department. He knows how hard this has been and he’s constantly checking on me. I may not have a lot of people to support me but I have a lot of support. Thank you for helping!
JUSTNOMIL,fc4iowi,t1_fc4ilrr,1577417791.0,Thank you. This shit sucks so much. She was finally starting to act loving and now we’re back to square one
JUSTNOMIL,fc4iljn,t1_fc4i992,1577417712.0,Thank you. The rational part of me knows that. But there’s still that part of me that wants my mom to be a mom. It’s like I have a part of me that’s still a child just wanting to feel like she cares.
JUSTNOMIL,fc4ih6l,t1_fc4i4jd,1577417613.0,"Yeah... she’s mother of the year. I think over the next few days I’m gonna dig through memories and work on a post of all the shitty things she’s done, for peace of mind if nothing else. I’ve held on to so much of this for so long I think writing them all out will help a lot."
JUSTNOMIL,fc4i8hm,t1_fc4hy2k,1577417416.0,The fight is a losing one for me at this point. I’ve made up my mind to protect her regardless of what anyone says.

JUSTNOMIL,fc4hrgv,t1_fc4hkq9,1577417022.0,Yep. That’s basically my mother in a nutshell. Here’s a little fun fact. Not the first person she’s brought into my life with this background. First dude she met WHILE HE WAS IN PRISON!!! Through a family friend. I was 15. My life is so fun.
JUSTNOMIL,fc4hl45,t1_fc4hbti,1577416877.0,Im not stressing the needing court documents because it doesn’t matter if he did or didn’t. The law says he did. I’m not losing my child for him. I do know of a couple people in my county that were wrongfully convicted so that’s why I say no proof either way. I really think the no proof either way has become my defense to keep from starting WW3.
JUSTNOMIL,fc4h8zd,t1_fc4h1c5,1577416597.0,She also didn’t know until I found out. I forgot to add that in the post because I was so scatter brained trying to put this whole situation into words. HE however did keep it a secret... for a YEAR.  I’ll edit the post to add that now.  As far as her believing he didn’t do it she’s one of those “I’ve known him forever and never known him to do such a thing” people.
JUSTNOMIL,fc4gh3h,t1_fc4g6wp,1577415960.0,"This has been my life in some fashion since I was 12/13 to some extent. I really think my grandma is just mad because I was so hateful about it and she’s always been the talk maturely person.
