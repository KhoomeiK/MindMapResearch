AskWomen,f316h91,t1_f3167k6,1570568941.0,"For me, my anxiety and depression was caused by my mood disorder (BPD). Maybe those medications aren’t for you because your problem is the mood disorder causing x y not x y causing your mood disorder. Antidepressants without mood stabilizers can cause that. Try talking to your doctor about this I feel like we may be on the same boat. For reference, I take Lithium. No problem! Good luck :)"

I specifically asked my doc to prescribe me Mirtazapin (don’t remember how to spell it) but it is an antidepressant that helps with sleep and appetite (basically what I was telling myself why I was smoking). You can’t take it alone though otherwise you run the risk of having a manic episode. So be sure to take it with your mood stabilizers!!"

BPD,f30z8b0,t1_f308ll9,1570565105.0,"Are you saying empaths don’t exist? I feel like being able to sense someone’s energy has nothing to do with being psychic, but just being able to notice and pick up on tone shifts, mood shifts, facial expressions and body language. Being able to read a humans emotions and therefore, “sense it” does exist! And this Quora repost is not about science, but as someone’s personal experience with BPD. Ironically enough, a lot of “accurate websites” are not accurate in describing pwBPD and their experiences. But appreciate your input!"

BPD,f30y9gu,t1_f2zdzna,1570564586.0,"this is me as well!! but there are days when I’m near my FP, my close friends, family too or even just watching the news where I just feel like I am absorbing everyone’s pain. Part of that probably has to do with the fact that I feel like I am burdened with everyone’s suffering and want to make them feel better."
BPD,f2za8wh,t3_des57m,1570511940.0,"Regardless of how shitty of a person she is, there’s really no reason to speak about another woman in that manner. You’re better than that. It seems like both your ex and his girlfriend are extremely toxic, and I don’t blame you for these thoughts. We’ve all been there. I think it might be in your best interest especially considering your ex was physically abusive, that you cut him off from seeing your child until he gets his shit together (gets a job, gets off drugs etc)."

BPD,f0lys5s,t1_f0lw9f8,1568732777.0,"he never uses it against me as he doesn’t truly understand it (just only recently realized I might have BPD, early stages of therapy). i think it’s more him using the mistakes i made bc of my BPD against me. which i get, shit hurts and sometimes you don’t get over that. or sometimes it takes more effort. i definitely haven’t been acting accountable. i’ve definitely lied first. have acted out. have made many mistakes that might make him feel like he wants to lie now too or get all disrespectful. I don’t excuse it. But I’m only just starting to get my shit straight and he had to go through a lot of my bullshit from BPD for years. Not excusing him, just tryna be understandable. I think he reacts better and always admits to when he’s wrong when I communicate better with him. Just gotta figure out how to do that without splitting because betrayal is a huge trigger. And also he’s very defensive when he gets confronted and attacked. 

Thank you I appreciate you so much"
BPD,f0lvjcb,t1_f0lv9tf,1568730586.0,I completely agree!! And he seemed to agree too but these last 2 weeks I think he’s been secretly doing this behind my back bc he just as much doesn’t feel assured/trusts me. Though I know i’m not doing anything right now I know in the past I’ve been doing the same to make myself feel better about the fact that my SO is prob going to abandon me and is doing something bad  (BPD)
BPD,f0lrsl5,t1_f0lkhs9,1568727894.0,"I agree, but his lying is a result of my actions"
BPD,f0lh2t6,t1_f0lgmub,1568717687.0,thank you for your response btw i appreciate it
BPD,f0lh29q,t1_f0lgmub,1568717668.0,"He was lying about doing shit on instagram he knows I’m uncomfortable with/would be just as uncomfortable if I did.  Yes in the past, due my BPD, I may have not made it feel safe for him to be honest and in addition may have given him a reason to not trust me and therefore doing these things to make him feel better about possibly him feeling the same way I’m feeling. But I’m trying to be neutral and figure out a way where it’s not like that.

I may be delusional and giving excuses, but I can understand possibly why he justified it. I know it’s not okay. Lying is never ok. But he did communicate with me that he equally felt not assured by me. I don’t think he fully understands he’s making an unsafe environment and doesn’t know much about BPD. We’re taking baby steps and I can see he’s trying to be there for me but it’s hard when you don’t know shit about it bc all my actions just seem impulsive and immature to anyone outside of my relationship you know? I’ve messed up a lot of things. For that reason I’m willing to move past it. It’s going to be hard. I just had an episode for an hour where I was shaking and now I’m over it. I’ll try to talk it out with my therapist to move on. I just need him to say those things^ so that I do understand. I just don’t want him to get all defensive and say “idk” when I ask why he lied to me."
