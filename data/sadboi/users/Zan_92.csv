Obviously neither of these people will show their bad side right away.  They may even convince themselves they love you.  The constant is that they were both actually hateful, deeply insecure trash human beings who always tried to make it clear to me that they thought they were actually better than me.

One of them was struggling through grad school and had never worked a real job in his life.  Everything in life was handed to him, and **it showed.**  He could find something to whine about in everything and everyone around him; it was exhausting and like hanging out with a giant baby.  The other one was a real estate agent who thought his job made him So Important.  He would mention his two masters degrees every. single. time. he met a new person.  They both were pretty miserable with their professional and personal lives, and dealt with it by putting everyone else down because misery loves company.

They were both hateful, vile, and petty people.  One of them encouraged me to use someone i met abroad for sex because he hated their ethnicity (apparently he had beef with every Saudi person ever).  Same guy mentioned he felt karmic revenge when the sister of his childhood bully died.  Same guy had a panic attack immediately after moving in with a gay friend, thinking that he was going to get HIV/AIDS from sharing a living space.  They were both homophobic, racist, sexist people who were borderline obsessed with their own moral superiority 🤮🤮🤮

Then I was in a relationship with someone who was like “NO srsly just lie back and relax and stop apologizing for how long it’s taking you and let me make you feel good”

And it turns out it is indeed pretty easy for someone to make me cum given that they can follow simple directions and have a good attitude.  Since that ex partner, pretty much all of my regular dating partners can make me cum, and seeing them is a guaranteed O for me.

I think it’s a combination of letting go of some body shame and having much higher standards than I did when I was younger + a keener sense for personality red flags, but my dating and sex life has massively increased since that guy.

If you are genuinely interested in doing this, here are some tips:

* Meet first in a public place and do not plan on coming back home with them.  I would suggest getting to know the person as much as possible without doing anything physical as to gauge attraction and chemistry, as well as screen them for shadiness.  Ideally, you should meet at least a couple times publicly before having them over / going over to theirs.
* Insist on trading STI testing results.  Ideally, the best case scenario is to trade screenshots (blur out your last name) of test results, but some people don't have results online or in paper  (some testing clinics only give results over the phone).  Make sure they've been tested within the last 6 months.  Ask them about their safe sex practices: do they always use protection?  when they don't use barriers, is it only in the context of a monogamous relationship?  
* Before doing anything physical or inviting them to your place, go over limits - hard limits: stuff you/they absolutely refuse to do, soft limits: stuff that you/they don't enjoy.  
* Have a discussion between you and your BF about jealousy. How are you guys going to deal with any jealous feelings that may come up?
* Don't forget that you have the right to end any sexual encounter that you feel is awkward or uncomfortable.  

I've had several three+somes.  Some have been great, most have been awkward, a handful have been unpleasant. Feel free to PM me with questions."

People I admire who hustle and work hard, who are a good influence.  It hit me the other day as I was driving back from a friend’s place after a couple days of bomb ass tacos and gaming lol.  I just started ugly crying real tears of joy.

It’s nice to have people that believe in you even when you don’t believe in yourself.  To surround yourself with people who find it easier to love than to hate.  To have a routine.  To keep trying to eat healthy and exercise even when your stupid brain is pushing you towards unhealthy habits.  To have friends who accept and admire you, who don’t make you feel inferior, like you have to prove your worth.

For the most part of high school, college, and my early 20s, I willingly surrounded myself with people who would casually cut me down.  Maybe they didn’t mean to do so on purpose.  Probably they were all dealing with their own shit.  And I definitely didn’t feel like I deserved better.  I craved their approval, and the meaner and more distant they were, the more I wanted to win their hearts.  In any case, I’m done with exposing myself to other people’s vile toxicity.

I just feel content, for the first time in YEARS.  I can count the number of times I’ve felt this feeling in my life: when I landed a prestigious fellowship right of college; when I found out I got into med school; when I got published for the first time; when I saw a surgery in person for the first time in my life.  I feel hopeful you guys hahaha

And I’ve posted here before looking for support and have been met with more kindness and wisdom than i ever would have expected.  So thank you, fellow trolls ❤️💕

It’s going to be a long road to get to where I need to be, but I feel like I’ve finally reached a turning point."

Throughout two long term relationships, and a handful of casual fuck buddies, nobody bothered to pay attention to my body and figure out what could make me cum.  Realizing that nothing was WRONG with my body, or that my anatomy wasn’t “too complicated” to figure out was a real game changer.  My sex life has gotten exponentially better in the year since.  I just wanna go and tell young 20s me and every other woman enduring mediocre sex that she should raise her standards and expect to actually be pleasured by her partner..."
