I think that’s some huge assumptions you are making about him cheating on me. In no way has he cheated on me and this isn’t that type of relationship (believe me I’ve been in them). 

Maybe it was a personal insecurity of yours which slipped out but please be more aware how damaging it is to some relationships to plant that seed of doubt.

Thanks for your comment nonetheless x"

We dated when we were 16 but timing wasn’t right but have always been in love with each other so definitely feelings attached.

Thanks again x"
