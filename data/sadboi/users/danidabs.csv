Also, my sister explained the same symptoms listed above when she experienced serotonin syndrome and she did confirm as well that it was in fact the worst experience of her entire life. Prozac is also not the drug to OD on and successfully die."

BedBros,etou7sn,t3_ccp237,1563037721.0,"This has been happening to me lately as well. I try to go to bed around 9:30 so I can be up at 7 but always end up waking up around 4AM. Do you ever feel that you’re waking up because you need to go to the bathroom? That could be the case. If so, try not drinking about an hour or two before you go to bed. Also, do you drink alcohol? Alcohol is known to disturb from having a full sleep cycle and I often notice myself waking up in the middle of the night if I’ve been drinking. Temperature is a big one too.

askdrugs,es13opg,t3_c5a7qg,1561488539.0,"Actually just tried shrooms for the first time a couple weeks ago and I’ve been in SSRIs for about 7-8 years now. Ate about 3.5 and can honestly say I felt perfectly fine. I have heard of instances where SSRIs affect one’s ability to trip, requiring more in order for them to actually take effect. I would start with at least 2 grams and see how you feel. In conclusion, I am very satisfied with the whole experience and would try again."
