bigseo,fgrai6p,t3_f01qlv,1581042097.0,"I've successfully dealt with this type of client demand. First off, you will have to do a bit of extra work for them but you'll soon be able to demonstrate your intangible abilities. If they want to know their keyword rankings for impossible keywords and then criticize you for not achieving their target, spend time ranking and reporting on more sensible keywords and report on those too. Show traffic improvements from your defiance and provide structured out of the box suggestions that will show that you are not a robot in their machine; you are a creative force offering solutions which greatly enhance their business. If that fails, just start arm chair counseling them like a bar buddy until they lighten up. Most overly rigid business owners are hurting inside and they need to be consoled. I joke often that I'm 1 part seo consultant and 1 part therapist. People need an intelligent shoulder to cry on. Their actual therapist won't understand kpis or retargeting pixel frustrations, but you do. Leverage your unique position and make yourself useful rather than resistant to their rigid demands for deliverables.
