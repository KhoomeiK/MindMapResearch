DnD5e,fqi5gs2,t3_givy04,1589390471.0,"I DM Pathfinder, and what I like to do with the pre-written campaigns is to read through the book to get a basic understanding of what is written. Then I create cheat sheets for NPC's and combats and areas that I think my players are most likely to interact with.  
If they end up doing something I didn't fully prepare for, I at least know something about that area/NPC/combat, and I tell them that I hadn't fully prepared that so they'll have to bear with me while I reference different pages. It slows down play and they usually decide to not go that way so that they don't get bored while I'm reading things.  


But this all depends on your players.
