My father was a teacher, I grew up around teachers, and I got to see and hear the behind-the-scenes.  

Yes she's an adult, she can make her own decisions, but the atmosphere they met in, the relationship they should have, and the relationship they DO have, it's super creepy. 

I don't want to paint you a picture because you're her father, but that means in class, under tremendous regulations, the man had poor intentions. It would be one thing if they met 10 years later, but that's not the case. 

I would talk to her, keep in mind that at her age she will still want to rebel, and become defensive. She does however need to know where you are coming from. I'm sure she'll pull the ""but I'm an adult card"", but remind her where they met and how they know each other and if she had a daughter how that would make her feel knowing that her teacher thought of her not as a student.

Growing up I was a very weird odd one out kind of kid. When I hit high school I met who would later become my very best friend. 
Everything about us was identical, our looks,our laughs even our interests. Everyone called us ""the twins"". Most importantly we have the same birthday, down to the minute. November 2 1987 at 1:08 am. We and our mothers couldn't believe it when we figured it out. So being such a weirdo I had met my match.
Time went by and we remained friends, we lost alot of friends to suicide along the way. We both grew up poor, and of course our neighborhood wasn't the greatest so our friend group was very troublesome. 
We had however, a massive blow when his ex girlfriend and my friend died of liver failure. It was traumatic for him on a level I didn't understand. He got into heavy drugs and pulled away from all of us. I eventually moved across the country, and unfortunately he didn't come to my goodbye party.
2 years after moving I went back to visit my in-laws and the year before I got disturbing messages from him. He was drunkenly making passes at me, and he has a partner and I let her know, and asked her how he's been, of course he blew up and stopped talking to me all together.
So I'm on my trip back and I'm in a local mall and I hear this laugh. My spine tingled and my hairs stood up. It was him. The friend I was with knew our history and of course asked if I wanted to leave the area and very hesitantly I said sure. We head upstairs to the cafeteria and not 10 minutes later I hear the laugh again. There he is, 5 feet away and I couldn't stop staring at him. He didn't notice me and kept walking.
For the rest of the day I was obsessing, should I have said hi, is it too late to call or message him and tell him I saw him.
The next morning only 3 days into the trip I got a phone call that my grandfather was rushed to the hospital, so my partner and I packed up and drove 18 hours home.
3 more days passed, my grandfather is in rough shape, and I get a message, from my ""twins"" girlfriend. I open it and staring me in the face was his photo in an obituary. I wanted to die. My heart sank and I was suddenly so small. I couldn't believe it, myvtwin can't be dead. The worst part (for me) was everyone in his life never responded to me. I have no clue what happened. I finally heard that he had a heart attack in his sleep, but my gut tells me otherwise.
Anyway, to this day, every birthday, I hate my life. I'm about to have my third time having a birthday without him having his too. I feel so unbelievably guilty about it. Not just for not saying anything to him, but for the fact that someone I love left behind so many sad people. I also lost my grandfather the next day and I felt like I didn't get to mourn my best friend, I had to help my family, I feel guilty for that too.
Like I said I feel like a jackass even trying to relay that I can relate because what you went through is so fucking hard, but I will say I understand survivors guilt on my birthday, and it's terrible. I'm so incredibly sorry for the friends you've lost along the way, and I hope you stay optimistic."

She (manager) sat me down and one by one told me 5 HUGE lies this co worker had made up and of course I shut them down because they were bullshit.
 I spent the rest of my shift thinking the owner was going to come in and fire me (the manager had said this was likely going to happen because I wouldn't fess up). He came in didn't say a word to me and left. The rest of the staff were being weird (the evil coworker is rich and buys the girls lunch and Starbucks and gifts and so they kiss her ass),  so when my shift ended, I went to my doctor, told her what happened, expressed I felt like I was going to have a break down and she gave me 3 months off ,paid. How in the hell could I go back to work with a target on my back and have to face these childish co workers. 

I have dodged every message, text and email from all of my co-workers (the evil one got fired for exactly what I was trying to tell the manger in the first place). They've all asked me to come back, God only know what the two of them told everyone else. I couldn't care less. Currently I'm looking for a new job and enjoying my summer. 

I felt like I was overreacting. My doctor explained to me that my ptsd goes into crisis mode when my loyalty is questioned ,and they deliberately lying to have me fired put me into a defensive/vulnerable mental state. Being in this state is harmful and dangerous.

All of my relationships were terrible, on my part and theirs. Now I'm with someone I WANT to be better for. I respect her because I don't want to lose her, and whenever I feel myself reverting to my shitty ways I'll tell her and ask for a few minutes to think.

It's hard for both parties when it gets tough, but knowing who and what you need is what counts. I know her triggers, she knows mine, we recognize when we're about to hit buttons and take a step back. 

Question, would you say it's possible you're pushing him away because YOU think YOUR too difficult and don't want to put him through it all? I'm only asking because I had that and I remind myself she's with me because she wants and lives all of me. Idk if this relates at all just thought I'd ask.

I feel bad for her now. They're married and I've found out since it wasn't just me he was fooling around with.

I think you deserve better."

Just leave."
relationships,ez6gm1c,t3_d05e7z,1567712018.0,"I would say if you've already been friends for 5 years,you know that you can be friends again, if he's worth it and you trust him let him for go his own good. 

My very best friend is my ex boyfriend and we were friends first and that what we used to keep our friendship strong and set aside the feelings we once had. 

We broke up because he was going through a lot mentally and I was young and didn't understand. I wasn't able to be supportive as a girlfriend because I took everything personally, when really it was his anxiety.

That was 16 years ago, and we're still in each other's lives and very happy.


Idk if this helps at all, but if you're supposed to be in each other's lives, you will be."

Now I'm more about 10 pounds a month I'm eating more which is good because in the first week I could probably fit everything I ate on a plate. My fourth day I had a cookie because I thought of anything else was making me nauseous. Now I can eat I can drink I can have a snack but I'm not overdoing it."
Contrave,ez4ywf4,t3_cztwvs,1567694182.0,"I had this problem BAD at the end of my first month. I drank way more water, it still wasn't working. I incorporated greens in almost every meal and flaxseed at least once a day to help get things moving. Another trick is apple juice I don't know what it is about it but holy Hannah it really moves things along. As far as it goes for where you're at now look up breathing exercises for the toilet, it's real it's a thing and it's great for what you can do now."

relationships,ez2e6gq,t3_czvcx5,1567654797.0,"You absolutely have to go with what will bring you the most Joy. I might be a little biased because I kind of had the same scenario, if my father was alive to know I was with a woman I'd probably be dead.

I lost a lot of friends I lost contact with some family members fortunately my mom has my happiness at heart. 

Every loss I've had since is completely worth how in love and happy I am now. 

Worst case scenario you tell her, she doesn't feel the same and you've learned something about yourself, you're more open-minded and your heart is also more open than you thought.

Good luck I'm rooting for you I hope everything works out for you."
relationships,ez28439,t3_czv28q,1567653400.0,"Also I want to add, I think it's strange that he didn't come to you to begin with to even tell you about this woman, about their friendship and that it was making him uncomfortable
If that was the case I feel like that's something he would say to his partner."
relationships,ez25o5a,t3_czv28q,1567652871.0,"You've known him for half your life go with your gut, I was with someone for almost 10 years ( but met when we were 11 and I'm 32 now) and he was married for four of those years we even lived together, he got incredibly critical and difficult to be around and overall became a very angry version of himself. I didn't trust my gut. I don't mean to project my old relationship onto what's going on with you but I will say sometimes you really don't know who you're with even if you've known them for an incredibly long time.
I do hope that this ends up being a misunderstanding however and I'm sorry you're going through this but definitely communicate with him how you're feeling and hopefully he takes you seriously."

It seems to me you might slip with self doubt when you hear their opinions. Just remind yourself that they can't relate. They can never truly know how you feel. 

For the love of God don't change what you're doing, you're on the right track. Know yourself know your limits, and remind yourself ""I'm speaking German and they only know Chinese""."

Friend break ups are the worst, this year I ended my friendship with someone because it became too much, too dramatic too clingy. I'm better off and she learned my limits and I learnt mine.

Good luck!! üåû"

He's with you now. And if for some reason they decide to give it a go, then byeboi. 

I'm sorry you're going through this. 

On the other end of things I dated a guy and his ex wanted him back so badly she showed up to a party to unveil her tattoo of his name in huge letters on her arm. Later down the road we broke up, they dated, they broke up and now hate each other. 

Her arm reminds her everyday that it wasn't worth it, and I'm now with someone lovely and understanding."
