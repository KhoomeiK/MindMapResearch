I told him this hurt me and that I couldn’t sit on my hands and wait for him to figure himself out. He told me to deal with it and that I had to make a decision. Ghosting him was the decision I guess.
He postponed the engagement, the family already knows it’s off."

BPD,fr5wu9x,t1_fr5fqdc,1589915993.0,I’ve been cutting my own hair and giving myself piercings since I was 12. I’m pretty good at it now too :D
BPD,fr5won8,t3_gmox5n,1589915918.0,"I’ve shaved my head twice in two years. 

Dyed it almost every color of the rainbow.

While it grows out to “short hair” I’m constantly messing with it. Shaving the sides, trimming the top, bleaching it and cutting out the bleach.

I recently broke up with someone and didn’t touch my hair! Maybe I’m finally improving in that area. My hair has been “long” twice in my life (I’m 29). Other than that I’ve always had it short because I get impulsive and chop it all off. 

My mother actually humored me in Kindergarten (I was 5) and buzzed all my hair off...I got picked on like crazy, but I felt so free. That could be why I cut it when I’m feeling in a mood...it frees me"
BPD,fr1xnn5,t3_gm406r,1589827672.0,"I didn’t have an FP from age 19 to 27...I had two FPs before 19 and I just “broke up” with my latest FP of two years. I think it depends on where you are in your journey as well as which criteria you struggle with the most. I don’t think all people with BPD have FPs but I also don’t think most people who acquire FPs have them all the time. 
I’m avoiding that attachment like the plague at this point because having an FP triggers me, and my BPD seems to be pretty intense when I do. I’m quite mild when a FP isn’t in my life."
BPDsupport,fqylspr,t3_gl97f6,1589750672.0,"I used to drink, been sober for a year. I also used to smoke but I finally kicked that 6 weeks ago. Now I’m struggling with sugar...as weird as it sounds. Not nearly the type of addiction you mean, but if I’m not drinking or smoking I’m eating sugar.
I guess I should add...for me quitting things seems to be easy. I don’t know why, but I have a suspicion it’s because I cling on to something else to get that dopamine rush (sugar at this point). I’m slowly moving on to exercise and cutting back on sugar so I have a feeling I’ll be using that as my new “feel good” activity.
Not the type of advice I’m sure you wanted, but that has been my experience."

BPD,fqey3dk,t3_gia8ni,1589315508.0,"Sounds like a terribly hard situation for you, I’m sorry. The only way I’ve ever gotten over an FP is completely ending all contact to them. I stop texting, emailing, calling, etc. I delete their contact info, erase all old messages and start journaling more. It’s like going cold turkey from anything...it’s really really hard at first, but it gets easier the longer you do it. 
Since she’s a teacher you won’t be able to completely end contact, but you can do your best to refocus your energy into journaling, art, schoolwork, etc. Redirect your mind every time you think of her. And when the school year ends cut contact completely."

As for going from feeling sociopathic to empathic, I understand that completely! I can be so uncaring and self absorbed and then later feel absolutely shattered with guilt that I behaved that way. I just wish I could get a manual on how to live."

Anytime I tell him how I feel he says it’s my “fucked up brain” talking. It hurts so much to think he thinks everything I say or feel is because my brain is abnormal.

relationship_advice,fnq8lup,t3_g3agev,1587159778.0,"I guess I have an uncommon opinion. Yes she’s your daughter, but you shouldn’t have to put yourself in a toxic environment for a full week to see her walk down the isle. Is there another place you could stay so you only have to be around her future spouse for a few short hours? I can relate to this. People don’t realize the amount of stress that putting up with someone like that entails. I had to deal with something similar with my sibling’s ex. I eventually cut off contact and told her I’d be here if she ever needed me, but I’d never be able to be around her Partner. It’s a hard boundary, but you should be allowed to create one in an obviously toxic relationship like this."
dating,fm9ymsb,t3_ftmcj5,1585879553.0,"I NEVER text a guy first. Women learn early on that if a guy likes them he will do everything in his power to get ahold of her. Women want to be chased. I once made a guy (my fiancé) wait two days before I replied to a message he sent me. When he finally double text me I replied and we started chatting and here we are. Also, women don’t want to feel desperate...if they feel like they are chasing the guy, then they worry they will come off as desperate and he’ll lose interest. Just text her. Send her a sweet message or pick something out about her that you like and that you don’t think other people would notice and tell her. If you’re worried she’s using you for attention, move on. Don’t wait for her to message you, because she won’t."

I got a little bit of DBT in my IOP days and I believe those skills were what allowed me to finally be discharged from the program. They just aren’t “sticking” anymore because I’m practicing other things my therapist suggests and I’m not seeing the improvement I saw in IOP. My fiancé suggested Buddhism, which is (I believe) a core teaching in DBT (mindfulness and meditation)."

My parents have four cats now and they all adore my dad and my dad is the one who primarily cares for them (litter box and food). 
Some people either have never been around cats so they have a negative view on them, or they’ve only met a few angry kitties who they base their opinion on.
My fiancé didn’t like cats until he met mine. My one cat is very temperamental and doesn’t like men...yet she LOVES my fiancé and he likes her. Some men just need to be converted ;)"

relationship_advice,flsa7ld,t3_fqj8n8,1585437662.0,"I’ve been with two men like this. I divorced my ex-husband for many reasons, but one major reason was his inability to brush his teeth. There was a period in our relationship that he had GREEN plaque near his gums because he had gone that long without brushing! And he always wondered why I would never kiss him!
My ex bf didn’t know how to wipe his own a$$...he’d get dried sh!t crumbs all over our bed...
Those were the first two men I ever had relationships with so I just assumed men were gross. BUT then I met my fiancé and realized that there are men who are clean! The guy brushes and showers more often then me and I thought I was “obsessive” about hygiene.
So my advice, if he doesn’t change when you give him an ultimatum (and follow through with it) then I think it’d be best to leave. I’ve been there, and the stress of dealing with a gross man is NOT worth it!"

I go to town gatherings all the time— street dances, “party on the prairie” etc. Begin an exercise routine, eat healthy and learn to cook from scratch (it’s therapeutic AND you get really delicious meals out of it), try new things and dive into the ones that you find fun. Pamper yourself! I do a “me” day once a week where I paint my nails, do a facial, and soak in a warm bubble bath with candles and good smelling bubble bath. Also, experiment with the way you dress! Try different styles and fabrics. Just because you are single doesn’t mean you can’t look cute ;). Travel! I’m “poor” but I do day trips to nearby towns. There is a tiny town 20 minutes from me that has the whole town filled with music!

I always thought I had to date guys taller than me, but I’ve found that their personality is what matters and their height is just a physical characteristic. If they have a sense of humor and can be sarcastic and fun that attracts me to them more than anything. I also like when I can have intellectual conversations WITHOUT being interrupted (a huge pet peeve of mine). My fiancé is the same height as me and that doesn’t even matter, and to be honest, I prefer it. I’ve dated one tall guy (6’2”) and I felt like it was really awkward ...like I was a child.
