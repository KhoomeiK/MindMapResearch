lonely,fkinjtw,t1_fkgr7gh,1584224216.0,"I wouldn’t be here without my friends, but I didn’t make them until after I had my son. I was very lonely before that. 

My friends and acquaintances have pulled me through my ongoing cancer treatments. One even came to every single chemo appointment but one (my husband was at that one) and she even puts my follow up and specialists appointments in her own calendar. She’s even gone to some when my husband couldn’t. I will do the same for her and move mountains to repay her. 

Another one I met online and haven’t met yet after years but we plan to once things calm down. I love her dearly and we have amazing conversations. I consider myself lucky to know her. She even helped me get into PhD school and believes in my work. I would again do anything for her. 

I have one friend since childhood who drove almost two hours to come to my “no more chemo” party. I hadn’t seen her in years. we had a falling out due to her ex husband but now we’re friends again like old times. She is the only person I speak to from my childhood and I would do the same for her. 

I have several other neighbors and acquaintances I really like and respect. Not best friends, but people who love my son and help me out and vice versa. People who proved how wonderful they were especially when I got sick. 

It took a long time for me to get here, but it’s all based on several things:

* mutual respect 
* giving space
* open communication 
* not forcing things 

My friends and I have had many disagreements but in the end I have to respect their opinions and they do the same. 

Do we talk every day? No way. We all have kids or lives and it wouldn’t be possible. And yet you can still build a strong friendship without that constant contact. 

One thing I do and one thing I’ve found that creates success is always asking about the other person AND being open and honest about your mistakes. I SUCK at asking about other people’s lives. I owned it and told my friends I’m going to make a conscious effort to do that. They supported me and appreciated it! Good friends know you’re not perfect but will love it if you make the effort to improve. We want to see each other do better, always, and will love and accept each other. 

I often see people on here complaining that they get ghosted easily. Well, you have to make an effort, too. I used to suck my friendships dry and not know why, until I realized that’s not how things work. It IS draining and there’s only so much a person can take. That’s reality. If you can’t think of anything to say, either there’s no real things in common (it happens) or you need to make an effort if you’re really invested. 

It’s also not about being overly attached either. A lot of people can sense that desperation. 

Friendship is a balancing act. It’s ensuring you’re getting your needs met while being considerate of others. It’s doing, not just saying. 

It’s also not making your entire life based on that person. I’ve been there, done that. I am embarrassed at my mistakes but it happens. 

It takes years, but it happens. But expecting instant connections and whatnot isn’t fair for any relationship. Give it time, and it’ll happen."

These people don’t think. I can’t get many of my supplies I need because everyone bought them up. Thankfully I had some stocked up from months ago when I first got sick, but there are thousands like me.

I’m not even talking about the food thing here, I’m talking about just doing one thing to help you not feel like crap anymore. 

I don’t have a food addiction or whatnot, but this is a major life change on their “path.” It’s their “last hope” so they should embrace it. 

Also, I can’t believe how some of the family members don’t even encourage it. Yes, enablers, but this person just had surgery!

I’m sure this can be applied to a lot of post-surgical patients. Any doctors or nurses here who witness this phenomenon?

Edit: My breast surgeon and the surgery unit in general followed iCOUGH.
