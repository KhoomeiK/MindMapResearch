minimalism,fpwb721,t1_fpwag1m,1588960390.0,"I read that article. It is such a shame that someone who has the chance to write to such website could write something like that, it only shows how ignorant she was for not actually researching about his life and works. It's okay if she doesn't like him, the fact is that the attacks are pure nonsense and totally out of context.

It's true that his persona in Walden is not accurately related to some facts and events in his life. He didn't tell us that he was mourning and working on a book about his late brother. He didn't tell us about Emerson lending the land, or even the practical reason why he left. But you can see he doesn't speak as if everybody had to live like that. He knew people are diverse, and  in our diversity we still can develop a relationship of acquaintance towards Nature and awareness of our reality and societal issues, for example. 

This article is literally dumb because it shows how a person could aggressively attack Henry's works and memory so fiercely without knowing about him. She borderline calls him sociopathic. If she cannot even read his works, the mere reading of his biography and stories told by people who ACTUALLY met him and lived with him should tell her something: he was nothing like this figure she tried to paint. He could be quite rude when someone interrupted him, or could be aloof, or even a prude sometimes. You know, flawed like each and every human. Like you and me.

If Schulz did learn about Henry D. Thoreau, she would know that he paid rent to his parents as if he was a regular boarder. She would know that he loved his family and friends so much. He was sent to try to rescue Fuller's body. He comforted his brother John while dying from a painful death from tetanus. He devoutly nursed his father during tuberculosis decay. He was loved by children and loved children too, taking them to walks, cooking them popcorn and doing tricks; these children eventually grew up and told nothing but good things about him. Edward W. Emerson wrote he was the best kind of older brother. Loiusa May Alcott thought he was some kind of ideal man, for she platonically fell in love with this man who was her teacher when she was a child, and became a friend when she got older. Those are only two examples. Schulz probably doesn't know that Thoreau admired indigenous peoples far from an ethnocentric perspective. He loved to sing and dance. He was seriously committed to the Railroad Underground and the abolitionist movement itself. He personally took care of a few enslaved people while participating in the arranging of what was necessary for them to scape to Canada. He was a friend whose death made people deeply mourn, and even those who never met him still mourned and mourn. 

Henry Thoreau was and is missed by many. As I said if you don't like him that's totally fine but you should base your judgment on actual information about him. 

Peace."

At least to me, it means that is some ways, the less you have, also the less more you have to worry. It doesn't make sense with absolutely everything but as a general rule, yes. Imagine having a lot of property and items that need repair from time to time. 

In a 21th century context I'd say, the less you conform with society's standards of ""sociability"", wealth and strength, the more you have to focus on what is actually important."

That wasn't free and Emerson benefited more from Thoreau in an economic perspective that the contrary. 

He also did a lot of work in his parents house, which was a boarding house. The Thoreau boarding house had Irish girls as servants and he took laundry to them. Fair enough if you consider it wasn't his mom actually doing it and he repaired pretty much anything in the house even not living there. Ah, and when he moved back to his parents' boarding house, he paid rent as a regular boarder.
