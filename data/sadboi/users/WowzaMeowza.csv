Anxiety,fr53dct,t1_fr3bw7s,1589901777.0,"I had this same issue. I‚Äôve been having anxiety attacks for years but always minimized myself because I knew they didn‚Äôt fit the description of panic attacks and didn‚Äôt realize they were different. I got to a point last year when I was literally having all-day anxiety attacks with occasional panic attacks at work. Since my position was fast-paced and high-stress I ended up taking a medical leave of absence and eventually resigned because just thinking about work would send me into a spiral. 

Therapy, specifically dialectical behavioral therapy, has completely changed how I process my thoughts and emotions and I wish I would have discovered it sooner. I would highly recommend anyone dealing with similar issues look into DBT or CBT (like DBT, cognitive behavioral therapy helps teach methods of changing one‚Äôs thought processes and behaviors)."

The biggest problem we had was leaving him out of his kennel since he‚Äôs very high-energy (blue heeler/Australian shepherd mix) so we slowly transitioned to him being left in a room where there was nothing for him to get into. We would often leave him with things like Kong toys frozen with peanut butter in them to keep him distracted for a while.

I know a handful of folks who even got fired after calling in sick despite having illnesses such as the flu, bronchitis, pneumonia, etc. 

It seems that the higher ones wages, the more likely they are to have access to paid time off (sick or otherwise) and/or health insurance. There are of course many of these individuals as well, but unfortunately the folks most of us will encounter in public (grocery store workers, etc.) are the ones most likely to be in the situation of pushing through their illness in order to make ends meet and/or not lose their job. 

All that to say, this is based on my experiences in the Midwest.

My mom recently mentioned setting up her spare bedroom for my child which made me realize she truly doesn‚Äôt understand how much trauma she (they) directly and indirectly caused on my sister and I.

That nearly always leads to frustration for me, which often evolves to depression, anxiety, self-resentment, etc. 

My mind really benefits from lists so I‚Äôve started keeping task/project lists to refer to during this time. At my worst, i can use the most basic list which has simpler things like ‚Äúvacuum 1 rug‚Äù or even just ‚Äúput dirty laundry in basket.‚Äù I keep these tasks as quick and easy as possible so I can more easily accomplish one (or more) when I‚Äôm feeling down because ideally, it‚Äôll get me in the right mood and will lead to a more productive moment. At worst, I‚Äôll have completed one simple task which is better than none. 

For when I have more energy (physical and/or mental) I have a list of other ideas to do, like craft projects I want to try, necessary household maintenance (eg, clean gutters), etc. I have a little notebook that I keep the lists in, to include my list of lists, so I can easily flip through and usually find something to do that matches whatever level of energy I may or may not have. If I don‚Äôt feel capable of accomplishing literally anything, I try to focus on my basic needs (brush teeth, shower, hydrate, eat) and consider anything to be an accomplishment. 

As a side note, I‚Äôve also realized that music tends to make or break me in these moments so I try to have go-to albums/playlists/stations to help get my mind in the right place. Of course you may not like the same music as me, but fast-paced (the Strokes or Caged the Elephant) is great when I just need a boost of energy. If I need some cozy/chill/happier vibes, I‚Äôll play Fleet Foxes or the Head and the Heart. Etc, etc.

ADHD,f1ivv8l,t3_d0k4l6,1569515540.0,"I'm not sure if you've found the help you were looking for, but here's my experience in case it helps...

The things that helped me the most were using a planner near-religiously for time management, and studying in quiet, visually-boring corners of libraries. It took me a total of probably 8 years to get my bachelors of general studies, and I won't lie and say it was easy... but it truly did get much easier each year despite the content getting more difficult. 

As soon as I received class syllabi, I would go through and write down every single thing in my planner. I used weekly layouts, as well as monthly so I could see everything at a glance. Using color-coding for each class also helped a lot since I'm a visual person. For bigger projects or papers, I would try and break them down into smaller chunks and set time aside for those smaller pieces so it felt easier to tackle. 

The thing that probably helped me the most with tardiness was routine and self-rewarding. I had an on-campus student job so my class and work hours were the same each week. I would reward myself with coffee once I got to work, and since I really wanted that coffee, the earlier I got there the happier I was. It helped to tell myself that I had to be there 15 minutes before I actually had to be there, that way if I was running a little late, I was actually still on time.

I've personally not had too many struggles with sleep, but time (and anxiety) does get away from me sometimes at night. I just try to stick to a sleep schedule as much as possible. Since I am to be asleep by 10:30, so around 9 I try to look for a stopping point on whatever I am doing so I can wind down and be in bed by 10.

As for accommodations, I would definitely recommend talking to your student accommodations office to see if there are any on-campus or local psychological resources where you could get official documentation. I wasn't officially diagnosed until after I graduated and I wish that I would have done it years ago using the resources available to me. 

The thing I (still) struggle the most with is forgiving myself for mistakes. The first time I was in school I dropped out because I was so easily discouraged. When I went back, I had to keep reminding myself that my grades, feedback, etc. didn't define me. I was so glad to see your comment saying that you know you are smart enough to do the work. Just try to keep yourself out of your head and focus on one small thing at a time!

Healthyhooha,ezddydp,t3_d0t94q,1567848707.0,"I‚Äôve gotten paps from two different doctors in the Midwest. In my experience, the doctor usually comes in first to ask some basic questions (sexual history, date of last period) and will then instruct you to change into a paper gown if you‚Äôre wearing pants. Once they come back in, you lie down on the exam table. If you‚Äôre also getting a quick breast exam, it basically consists of them pressing different areas of each breast to check for lumps. My doctors both tried to keep me distracted with conversation, usually something light-hearted. 

For the actual pap, they‚Äôll have you lie down and step your heel into the stirrup things. (This is when you‚Äôll feel most vulnerable but try to remind yourself that it is a trained medical professional doing something to ensure your health.) You‚Äôll slide your pelvic region close to the end of the table. They will likely talk you through the whole process. My favorite doctor eases into it and briefly touches my thigh so I‚Äôm not caught off guard when the speculum is inserted. They will then insert the lubricated speculum which feels awkward but likely not nearly as bad as you might think. 

Once the speculum is in, they quickly take what looks like an extra long q-tip and insert it to gather samples for testing. This is the most uncomfortable part for me. I‚Äôm not sure how to describe it, maybe a very dull localized ache where they gather the sample. They then remove the speculum and leave the room for you to get dressed. You may need to wipe some lubrication off your genital area before getting dressed. They will likely give you plenty of time and then step back into the room and let you know when to expect to hear the lab results.

AskReddit,er86z0r,t3_c0qaj7,1560597738.0,"Once. I was struggling in college due to depression and anxiety so I decided to withdraw and get a job at a call center, answering phones for Medicare. It sounded fairly easy, came with benefits, and paid well for a job that didn‚Äôt require a degree. I ended up becoming even more depressed than I was because it made me realize how terrible the medical system is in this country. Some calls were fine but I had a lot of conversations in which the caller begged me to do whatever I could because they were so close to eviction, bankruptcy, etc. due to the cost of their medications. All the while, we had supervisors yelling at us to keep the calls as short as possible. 

To top it off, we were only allowed to use the restroom during our allocated breaks, so one day when I was having terrible stomach issues, I decided I‚Äôd had enough and walked out.

I ended up working in food service for a year before deciding to go back to school. My grades had gone to shit so I had to go to a community college to get my GPA up. I got an Associates degree, then went to a university, found an easy student position on campus, graduated, and got hired as a staff member using connections I made in my student position. I‚Äôve since been promoted a few times and am making way more than I ever expected to. 

Walking out of the call center that day was a risky decision since I had to quickly find a way to pay bills and it meant that I lost my health insurance. But it was also arguably the best decision I ever made because if I had stayed, I probably 1) never would have taken the initiative to better myself, and/or 2) would have spiraled into a deeper, possibly dangerous level of depression."

I get it if they have a cold or something but someone I work with always makes a whistle-y sound when they breathe and it makes me want to punch them, especially if I hear it during a meeting. I can‚Äôt concentrate on anything else once I hear it."
AskReddit,epx2tkq,t1_epwz5e9,1559590698.0,Thank you! That sounds awesome! I‚Äôll be sure to check it out... before I get distracted and forget. ü§£
AskReddit,epwyz14,t1_epwrc05,1559588081.0,Can I ask what app you use for accountability? I‚Äôve been trying life without my meds and to say I‚Äôve been feeling overwhelmed is an understatement.
proplifting,epwx9z8,t1_epwc98k,1559586910.0,"This is exactly my train of thought. If I happen to get more successful props than I was expecting, I know enough people who will gladly take them off my hands (bonus if they‚Äôre able and willing to trade for some I don‚Äôt already have!).

They‚Äôre good enough that my formerly-vegetable-hating husband requests them regularly!"

HomeImprovement,eogwjff,t1_eogmfa4,1558567331.0,Do you by chance have any photos? I have a similar setup (load-bearing wall between kitchen and living room) and am always thinking about how nice it would be to have an opening to make them feel more connected.
