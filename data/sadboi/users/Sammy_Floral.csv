Futurology,fbbrh38,t3_ec5ne8,1576706491.0,"Here’s a crazy thought: what if there’s already intelligent life out there in space, but we simply have not evolved the sensory capacities to detect them? I mean, there are animals who have sensory capacities we can only dream of. What if we as humans didn’t evolve enough to detect other, more advanced forms of life? To give an example, in our day to day lives, we don’t ‘see’ any magnetic fields. 

Could this be why we think we are alone in this world? We could be too basic for such life forms and they probably live in some kind of metaspace, with a more advanced sensory system."

You could come up with so many research questions, but most of them have already been answered by other research groups with bigger samples.

So far, finding the knowledge gaps, that are worth exploring, is quite hard. And even if you come up with some ideas, you would want it to be interesting for your PI as well."

And they feel like they should have some papers written up at the end of the first year. However, in my experience, a lot of the delay in the progress comes from underestimating the workload, lack of supervision and things that are out of your control. It’s true that as a PhD student, you should enjoy the learning process and learn from such mistakes, but one can’t help but feel like they’re not putting in enough work.. (myself included)."

Sometimes, you can have colleagues sitting next to you and still feel terribly alone.
