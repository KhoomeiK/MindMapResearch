I paid for the month I couldn‚Äôt go bc they are a small business with the idea I would return. The gut punch- the owner re-vamped the programming and changed the class times.  I get that for him he sees growing the business as #1. But he took away the ONLY class I can attend. I wrote him a very nice email about the class time and he offered to hold my membership for May while I think about it. But he would like me to try anyway to rush to an earlier class or go to a class later. Problems- gym is 20 min from my office. I can‚Äôt leave on time every day I am a professional office worker and 2nd in charge. I can‚Äôt just bolt out at 5.

AmItheAsshole,fkkcy4f,t3_fixk8t,1584280889.0,"NTA but my answer we will focus not on the financials but the work. 

She should at least try being a lawyer. This is coming from a lawyer. Law school is the most miserable experience I had scholastically. There is a ridiculously high rate of depression in law school students (and in law). That depression can cloud your judgement. 

Being a lawyer is far better than being a law school student. Did she do a clinic or does she have an opportunity to do one? If so I suggest trying it. Having contact with a client who you help can be life changing.

Does she know what kind of lawyer she wants to be: transactional or a litigator? Private firm or government? 

Lots of lawyers help people. Public interest lawyers who help victims of domestic violence, employment or housing issues. Much like teachers folks in public interest often see ourselves as ‚Äúcounselors at law.‚Äù Basically we try to teach or educate our clients about their situation. Client centered lawyers are lawyers who take this as their main focus. Educated and incorporate the client into the process and let them make choice about how the case proceeds. This helps the disinfranchized person get a sense control over their situation and make the choice best for them. Client centered is the opposite of old school paternalistic lawyering. An example is when I hear an old lawyer say: I am gonna tell that fucker what to do and he is gonna do it because I say so.  The client centered lawyer says: I am going to listen to my client, talk to them about the facts the law and how they apply in their case. Try to understand all the factors in the client‚Äôs decision making process internal and external. Talk about those. Make sure I did my due diligence in education and let them make choices. 

I work in public defense. It isn‚Äôt for everyone but there is no better calling if you want to help persons at the fringe of society. It is an opportunity to truly help. However it does have a high burnout rate, I have been doing it for over a decade and am working toward my goal of being a public defender for 30 years. 

I would encourage your wife to try being a lawyer. She may find that she can channel her desire to educate and help into her legal practice. Hell she could work with kids they need lawyers too. 

Teachers make less and work just as hard as lawyers. My teacher friends enjoy their summers off but the ones who work in troubled schools see violence and poverty just as much as a public defender.  There are some programs to help payback loans in some situations if you are public interest. She is 200k and 7 years in. She should give it a whirl."

Make some fun alternate plans with friends and have a great night. Hell wear that dress she told you to buy so it doesn‚Äôt go to waste.
crossfit,fgaikq0,t3_exoiup,1580651671.0,"No expert. But here is an article that summarizes which muscles are worked. 


https://www.muscleandmotion.com/wall-walk-anatomy/

Seems like you might need to do a series of movements  to capture all of that. Maybe/

Seated dumbbell presses
Pile pushups from box (knees or toes)
If you got real froggy you would practice getting in the like and lifting 1 leg at a time off the box. 
Add in some ab work like planks, toes to bar (or scared variation)"

Knoxville,fg67xuy,t1_fg5nanj,1580558185.0,"It is possible to have good constituent services while being a person who‚Äôs ideology is bad for our country. Jesse Helms was known for his his constituent services in NC and that helped that homophobic racist to get re-elected over and over. 1 of a Senator‚Äôs jobs is to help the people of their state. But they wear many hats. Arguably even more important is taking the country in a direction that makes us a better nation, for many of us that includes not being the new Pre/during WWII Germany. 

I am glad you got your health care issue resolved. I also would like us not to be a nation that rolls around in racist xenophobic racism like a pig in slop."

Explainlikeimscared,feweoh1,t3_eqj57q,1579409339.0,"I had to do this last year when the car I had and had not paid off turned out to be a lemon. A long and irrelevant story ensued. 

Deserves bought my car for less than I owed so I did not break even. Remaining amount of car was rolled into new loan minus my deductible. 

I don‚Äôt think I can give a better answer than the top. The only thing I would add is know your FICO score so you have an idea of where you should be on the percentage of your loan (ie better fico better rate). 

It was very scary for me. I was super uncomfortable with having to get rid of a car before laying my loan off. But the dealer wants to sell you a car and the finance people can help you. You can work thru this situation.   It is manageable. 

When looking for your next car do a lot of research on reliability to help you find the most affordable reliable car you can of money is tight. A cheaper car isn‚Äôt cheaper if it isn‚Äôt reliable. Been there and done that for sure.  

Good luck."

AmItheAsshole,fed75og,t3_eoeslw,1579002066.0,"YTA you took a woman in the most fragile of states - emotionally and physically- and made her situation worse. I cannot help but wonder why your husband didn‚Äôt help you work thru the pros and cons of having that conversation before hand. 

If she has that kid she will NEVER be able to be away from your family and the family of her now deceased husband. Can you even imagine how hard that could be for a widow. 

She must have really trusted you to tell you her secret. And you turned it against her. 

YTA even if your intentions were good and you thought you had a band-aid for this terrible situation (for both you, your family, and her).

Even tho I am voting YTA, I am sorry for your loss. I can only hope this suggestion came out of your own grief."

You went to far. Total unadulterated dick move. 

I would have totally understood if you said while on my watch no driving but Instead you imposed your will on your ex and your kid to make a point.
