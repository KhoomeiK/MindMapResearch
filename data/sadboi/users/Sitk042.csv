Putin?  He’s ruined our standing in the world, we are going from a Superpower to a third world banana republic.

He’s hijacking supplies purchased by the states and giving them to that recently formed company (owned by his friends), which didn’t exist 1 month ago but is now the largest supplier of PPE in the nation.

How much money did the Soviet Union spend on the Cold War trying to defeat the Americans?  Trump is a bargain compared to that outlay.

Of course it was reasonable to react (to the suicide) the way you did, therapists are sensitive folk.  I wonder how long you had worked with the poor guy?  It’s got to be tough time for therapists during this pandemic. Everyone staying at home.  I had a tough time with my Psycologist on video chat.  Plus are people choosing therapy over food/shelter/etc?  Lots of stress on everyone.

Did your BF meet this person?  Did they get along?  Did you ever have feelings for him?  Was he attractive? There are so many issues here to consider.  I always feel bad for a young relationship like this, sure it was insensitive.  But in the times of the plague, you all are recommending they break up?  

I get that they are young(26), but how about we look at this pragmatically.  If they break up this is the absolute worst time to do it.  They very nearly guarantee they will be exposing themselves to this virus is one if them moves out...

Maybe she tries to work it out with the boyfriend, they bond over it.  The guy just died.  Grief takes time, I know I’m a widower.  But she WILL eventually get over this grief.  If the bf moves out, gets the virus and dies how does that make you feel?

I’m sure this comment will be downvoted, as it’s contrary to the prevailing sentiment.  But hopefully OP can see it from her BFs perspective as well, as most therapists can.

God who cares about sitk042.  I approached this problem from another point of view, the nature of reality.  

I, as a lot of people, believe that we live in a simulation and that ‘god’ could just be who is running the simulation.  So He would have god like abilities in the simulation.  I don’t know if this is what reality is.  But after I started seeing His influences in my life.  I feel like I have a true relationship with ‘Him’.  He has a great sense of humor and sends me miracles about once a week.  Little things that make my life easier.

This works for me.  I still believe that the base reality is godless, but that my life is better since I started asking Him for help and getting my prayers answered.

Swingers,fm0q3xe,t3_fsc1az,1585663895.0,"We were members of a group who would have multiple house parties a month.  

They were still having parties until fetlife shut them down.  I still think they met for a small party on Saturday.

These younger folks (20-40) just don’t seem to care about society and their fellow humans.  I think if we can’t shelter in place, then we should die out.

Edit: I’m sorry if that wasn’t clear, I meant the young folk in that group, just didn’t seem to think the virus applied to them although one of them privately told me he was exposed to the virus, and was still planning to host a party."
