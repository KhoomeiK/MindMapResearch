FemaleDatingStrategy,erk9dne,t1_erk8wg8,1560958385.0,"I agree.. it‚Äôs not fun and there isn‚Äôt anything good for people being abused, it‚Äôs absolutely terrible no matter what sex"
FemaleDatingStrategy,erk98jg,t3_c2c8et,1560958294.0,"Well first thing first yes women get sexual abused 1 to 4 do and men get sexually abused 1 to 6, I do think that this should be eliminated but women get a lot more support than men when it comes to sexual abuse... so in that case if you want it to be ‚Äúequality‚Äù then women need to get less support for sexual abuse (which isn‚Äôt right everyone should get the same amount of support regardless of sex or gender)

Next thing is well most domestic abuse is caused by women other by manipulating, down talking or take advantage of their parter, although men do hit their partner more often compared to women it‚Äôs 60% of men compared to 40% of women but the worst part is most men can‚Äôt do anything about it because they are often criticized or made fun of, but for ‚Äúequality‚Äù women should get less support and help if they are getting domestic abused (which again Isn‚Äôt right everyone should get the same amount of help and support regardless of sex)

Well homicide is often caused by same sex and it‚Äôs quite equal, actually in fact more men are killed in homicides, which makes no sense on what you said so technically for ‚Äúequally‚Äù women need to be killed more ( which is completely and utterly wrong, no one should die or anything) 

Again domestic Abuse 

And well again sorry to shock you but women actually cheat more on their partner, so for ‚Äúequality‚Äù men need to cheat more (which no one should cheat, it leads to heartbreak and betrayal which no one should feel regardless of sex)

I know you didn‚Äôt bring up any of these points but I would like to bring them up 

In custody disputes 84% of women and 16% of men keep the child, I can‚Äôt stress this enough it needs to be 50/50, you made them together, the father has equal amount of rights to see him them as the mother

80% of victims of suicide are males, and 20% women, and the worst part is most males get told to suck it up or to not feel this way 

97% of males die in war and 3% women 

And please explain this, fake rape claims like are you kidding me! The fact that a woman can sole handedly just ruin (without evidence) a guys life by saying he raped me is ridiculous. Now I do believe rapist lives deserves to be destroyed but not fake claims.

Another one is free programs and drinks and housing for women, why do all these things apply to women, why not men. Why are men not able to get certain scholarships but women are. 

If you gonna fight for equality fight for actual equality not against some problem you have against men, for example fight for women in Siberia please they deserve equal rights as men but in well developed country‚Äôs believe it or not men deserve equal rights as women"

FemaleDatingStrategy,eqlelkg,t1_eqldofz,1560142937.0,"I agree women killed animals as well, but most men did as well and they often went out to gather food. People in military don‚Äôt kill people or steal land because they want to, nobody wants to kill people, most certainly those with ptsd from war would agree. They do those things to stop threats for example 9/11, try to neutralize a terrorist leader, or hitter for example we tried to capture him, not because we wanted to but because those in the military wanted to save lives and get rid of threats. 

Idk how rape has to do with protecting more just seems like you just wanna attack men but yes women get sexually abused 1/4 of them have been in there life time but men get raped too 1/6 of them are sexually abused as well"

I don‚Äôt think the problem is peddled from men wanting to make women more fearful or less dependable or from men beating up or murdering their girlfriends (which isn‚Äôt the case with *most* men at all). I would argue that it stems from generations and generations of men usually having more muscle mass, this coming from them going out looking for food for their kids and protecting them from outside attacks.
