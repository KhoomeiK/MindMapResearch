You are going up slowly, so I think you will be in a much better situation. However, even if you do get some bad side effects, they might only last a week or so like mine did. I felt MUCH better after those days, and now I'm fine. Still waiting for the 4-6 week period to get a sense of the positive effects, but the terrible days seem to be over. I know everyone is different, but my ""bad before good"" situation lasted a week or so. I still have mild side effects, but they're tolerable for sure. Just keep eating and stay hydrated, even through the nausea (if you experience it) as best as you can. Good luck to you!"

prozac,fq91uws,t3_ghf0di,1589182618.0,"I'm coming up on week 3 on 20 mg. Prozac immediately took away my appetite. I started eating less which made the nausea worse which made me want to eat even less. In week 1, I also had some stomach aches, headaches, very fatigued, and general blah feeling. Week 2 was brutal for me. Hit with nausea, extreme anxiety throughout the day (I was doing deep breathing constantly), zero energy, heart racing, shakiness, and feelings of complete hopelessness. Today was the first day I woke up with only a bit of unusual anxiety. Definitely tolerable. Honestly, it might really suck for some days, and it might suck a little for some more days. I spoke to 3 doctors one day and just about called 911 because I thought I was dying. But here I still am, and honestly the side effects are already way better. My appetite is coming back, no more nausea, and the anxiety is way less. I'm taking prozac for BDD, obsessive thinking, and depression. I still need to give the medication time to tell if I'm getting the benefits, but I'm excited to potentially have some relief. The side effects will have been worth it if I do! Anyway, my advice to you would be to take it with enough food and plenty of water. For me it seems to be better to take the pill in the morning instead of evening, but everyone's different. Most importantly, know that YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY. Even when it seems like you might not be, you will!!! Of course you know you best, and be vigilant if you think you're having a serious reaction to the medication. But you will be okay no matter what. It's okay to be nervous. At the end of the day, you have to choose whether your life before medication is better or worse than what it could be like after medication. Good luck to you!"
prozac,fq912f3,t3_ghgbip,1589181822.0,"I'm no doctor, but here's what I think I know: prozac has the longest half-life of the SSRIs at approximately 4-6 days. It should be completely out of your system after about 23 days (give or take). Don't think too much on that big number though. The amount of prozac in your system will decrease with each day, and you'll likely start feeling better within a week or so. Maybe less! I'm coming up on 3 weeks on 20 mg, and I also had extreme nausea amongst other horrible symptoms. It sucks, but you will be okay soon. Good luck to you!"

I'm on day 9 now, and I feel extremely nauseous, dizzy, and anxious. Always on the verge of throwing up. I think if I get up right now, I would throw up. This is the first day it has been so bad.

For example, a mass shooter did what they did because they were [depressed/bipolar/schizophrenic/etc.]. It's such a toxic idea circulated by the media. That's not in every news story, of course, but I've heard it SO many times. A diagnosis does not dictate a person's actions. It can influence them, but that's the same as anything else. A lack of sleep influences someone. So does upbringing, education, an insecurity, a negative interaction, a virus, etc. It's even more complex than that. Society puts so much attention on singling out a reason why someone behaves a certain way. The reality is that it's never one reason alone.

I miss him dearly, but I don't think it's helpful for me to be in his life as he's currently not receiving treatment for the delusions. Sharing a little... Sorry. I'm sad."
schizophrenia,fo2gm3v,t1_fo2du4d,1587461656.0,"If I believed that someone was experiencing delusions, would it be okay for me to phrase it that way? For example, ""I think you're experiencing delusions"" as opposed to ""I think you're delusional"". My take on it is that phrasing it this way expresses delusional as a symptom and not a diagnosis. I'm interested in your opinion though. :)"
smallbooblove,fnwn6zj,t3_g49ufu,1587321602.0,"Nah, your body is killer gorgeous. If his comment really bothered you, it might be a good idea to have a polite conversation with him about it. No need to accuse him of anything, just kindly mention that comments like that affect you. You're allowed to be sensitive, even if you don't want to be sometimes. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

smallbooblove,fmtpnt0,t3_fxdo5e,1586376838.0,I am loving your esthetic and attention to detail. You're rocking it!!! ü§©
smallbooblove,fmtoykw,t1_fmtmuzv,1586376491.0,"Totally! You are free to buy from wherever you want, same for anyone else. I just heard it in the media recently and looked into it a bit. I meant no offense."
schizophrenia,fmtoe0m,t1_fmtlyqd,1586376212.0,"Understood. It poses the more broad question of where the moral line is for transferring genetic disorders or situational hardships to children. People with alcoholism, people living in extreme poverty, people with diseases that can be transferred to their child during childbirth or breastfeeding. Do these people consider the moral consequence of having a child? That's basically a rhetorical question, I know it's different for every individual. It's an interesting topic.

I think you have a high level of self-awareness and compassion. Those two things alone are hard qualities to come by in a person. Attractive partner and parent qualities. I'm definitely not trying to convince you to have a SO or children! I hope you won't take offense. Just my observation from the little bit I've gathered from your character. üòä"
smallbooblove,fmtjfrs,t3_fxcojp,1586373761.0,"I have heard that Doll Skill is not a very ethical brand with many controversies attached to their company. I have not personally done the appropriate amount of research to know all the details, however. I'm all for people making their own choices, but if this is something important to someone, best give their brand a quick search beforehand."
BodyDysmorphia,fmthwuk,t3_fx7kw1,1586373012.0,"I personally think I only do that with myself. I think it has to do with the fact that I look at myself in detail every day. Once I find something I get obsessed over, it's what I see first, then second, then third, etc., until I'm only seeing my obsessions. Let's say I meet someone I'm attracted to. I will look at the whole of their appearance (tied in with other qualities they have, since I don't find appearance alone attractive), and greatly admire them. As I continue to spend more time with them up close and personal, I begin to see their attributes independently. The difference is that I see each one and adore it even more because it belongs to the person I'm attracted to. If they have a physical quality similar to one that I obsess about on myself, I don't consider it unappealing on them at all. That's how I know my BDD affects only the way I see myself and not the way I see others. I've learned that you can have what is called *body dysmorphia disorder by proxy* which I suppose might make it hard to see the full picture of someone else's appearance. I don't have that though, so I can't say for sure."
schizophrenia,fmtcwwo,t3_fxa6th,1586370622.0,"Just out of curiosity, do you want kids? I remember you commented in the past about being a forever alone type, but what if you had a partner who really wanted kids?

It's an interesting question I've always thought about. I don't have schizophrenia, but I have other mental illnesses and genes I wouldn't want to pass on to children."
BodyDysmorphia,fmptej5,t1_fmpn1pp,1586286998.0,"Of course! I don't want to make excuses for his comments because they were very insensitive and rude. That being said, this can be a really, really difficult disorder to understand for those who don't experience it firsthand. So I also don't want to berate him with negativity because I don't know him (or you), your relationship, or how important he is to you.
I've been in both positions - the one who didn't fully understand my partner's mental illness and the other way around. Both situations are challenging. I feel like the most important things are honesty, trust, communication, compassion, etc. You can do your best to communicate effectively with him and see if things improve. If they don't, well, that's valuable information for you to know now instead of much later down the line. I truly believe that a compatible partner for you will try their best, and in turn, you will feel able to do so as well.
Haha I love that you're able to have a sense of humour about it. Children are so sweet but so unintentionally rude at the same time. üòÖ Good luck, my friend!"
BodyDysmorphia,fmnomkr,t3_fwd417,1586231100.0,"To me the biggest problem here is your partner's apparent lack of understanding. Perhaps you need to have a really thorough conversation about what it really means to have this illness. It's often irrational, isolating, embarrassing, obsessive, shameful, depressing, etc. The very nature of BDD is often obsessing about something to the point of irrational reaction. If he can't support you with understanding and patience, you need to decide if that's okay with you. If it is, you might have to go to someone else for support. If it's not, then that needs to be addressed.

I had an experience similar to that where 2 children on separate occasions called me a boy, one of them saying I was a stupid boy. Because I already don't feel feminine, something as insignificant as that (to other people) actually really upset me. I know how ridiculous that seems, but that's what this illness can do.

So I guess my advice would be to have a genuine, non-judgmental conversation with him about what it means to have BDD and how that can affect your thoughts and perception in situations. Maybe a chat with your counsellor for some advice about this could be a good idea when that's available to you."
schizophrenia,fmnb7bd,t3_fw9xbu,1586222136.0,"Depends how severe it is. If she has low self-esteem that's one thing, but if she is obsessive about her appearance to the point that it affects her daily life, that's another level. Be patient and supportive because she could be really struggling, even when it might seem insignificant to other people. It's very specific to each person, so it's hard to give advice. I have body dysmorphia disorder, and some things that have helped for me are physical affection (like hugs, cuddling), assurance that you'll be there for me while I go through this (not necessarily reassuring my physical obsessions), counselling, medication at times (bdd is closely related to ocd and the thoughts can be VERY much out of your control), don't suggest exercise/diets/plastic surgery,  try to get her to do things that she enjoys doing, learn her triggers and avoid them, be very very patient."

schizophrenia,fmklvjd,t1_fmkljua,1586159529.0,"I experience the anxiety, but I don't have hallucinations so I can't say I've had anything similar happen to me. When I'm in a depressive episode, nights are much harder. Other times I'm extremely obsessive and I'll be online for hours trying to figure out what caused my weird mouth and how to fix it with huge amounts of risky surgery and money. Then I get really anxious and nauseous. Sometimes I can cry myself to sleep which can help, but it can also backfire and keep me up."
schizophrenia,fmkky79,t1_fmkkoka,1586158573.0,"It's a vicious cycle! I totally feel you. I'll try to get into bed at a decent time, and then I'll just lie there thinking about how I'm not falling asleep for HOURS. I hate it so much. Then suddenly I'm itchy, hungry, lonely, depressed, obsessed, anxious, having to pee, etc. And now it's 3am and I'm still not sleeping. At least I don't have to go into work right now otherwise I'd be super distressed about it."
