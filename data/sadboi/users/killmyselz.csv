depression,f9wupij,t3_e6wilf,1575699217.0,"Not anymore. I mean sure, there were times when I just wanted to lie down and let the world pass by me until I myself pass away but that's just a manifestation when I thought nothing was worth living for. Now I don't know if there's anything worth living for now but I do know one thing. There's so much to experience out there, good or bad, despairing or enlightening. It's all there out there and yes it gets tiring once in a while and I do skip out of reality and take comfort in my solitude but then if I did just that then I don't think I would be doing justice to the only life I got to live now and also to my parents who went through a lot of shit just to raise me up lol."
ForeverAlone,f70wdmq,t1_f70vt1o,1573333338.0,Come on lol. Just be indifferent and do it. Get out of your comfort zone
ForeverAlone,f70v53p,t1_f70kukg,1573332883.0,Well that sucks. Maybe you should try going to a pub or any social event that happens in your vicinity. You might find some people interesting enough.
ForeverAlone,f70jilh,t1_f70i2jb,1573329072.0,Are you alone then during your shift or are there others too? Maybe you can socialize with them.
depression,f70hr3z,t3_dtpy4e,1573328532.0,But then do you ever wish someone would tell you to live despite everything you go through?
ForeverAlone,f70h6dc,t3_dtvla1,1573328369.0,What kind of job do you have?
ForeverAlone,f70fw48,t3_dtppxj,1573327954.0,Damnit. One member less in this community.
NEET,f6zbcs6,t1_f6z8jub,1573314015.0,"If I can get through my tough times then so can you. And the thing is, there is no such thing as an end to problems. I still have problems maybe not as severe as yours but they are there and I know I have to deal with it. Just know you aren't alone in the process. There are people who might be around the corner and are worth relying on."
NEET,f6z3fei,t3_dtpdtn,1573307880.0,"No shit doesn't work. Stop expecting it to work. Stop living in expectations that things will get better. They will only get worse. You already know what it feels like to be a piece of shit so just be that. Accept that and live through the failures. Trying your best, just learn to appreciate the process without giving a fuck about the results. You see patterns? Well fuck them too. Set out on an unknown path, a path that you can redeem yourself on. Don't give up thinking you aren't going anywhere cause you are."

medicine,f6v8d0y,t1_f6v5v1t,1573179293.0,"Being overworked and overstressed as a doctor is common everywhere. Just because it's common they think it's a normal thing for a doc and because you are a doc you should be able to treat yourself. You are always told that patient is everything but they forget that even docs have a life. It's ironic how they say medical professionals form the backbone of a healthy society, yet society does nothing for them in return to their service. A medical student killed himself? Oh wait, he must have had some personal problems not like it's got anything to do with the healthcare system right? I feel as if medical community as a whole holds tremendous power that if they decided they could bring their voices together and something could be done but oh well patient care comes first and it doesn't even matter so who cares :)"
medicine,f6uygsp,t3_dt5mir,1573171842.0,Because they weren't taught that their rights matter too during med school. ðŸ™‚

medicine,f68fdu5,t1_f672wbp,1572728220.0,"Yes. Here, students study right from 11th grade, that is when they are just 16 years old to clear the medical entrance exam and get admission. The age spectrum isn't really that broad, most students being in the 18-19 age group, some even 17 y/o in medical colleges. The thing is, most students are never exposed to the social norms during their high school life because they are under pressure due to cut throat competition for medical college. It won't be an exaggeration to say that an average student preparing for Medical exam here knows anything about what goes on in his country let alone his own surroundings.  We are practically slaves to the education system."
NEET,f63dyrm,t3_dqat0q,1572675739.0,"If you don't enjoy it, then why don't you try to get out of it? Go join a college, or whatever grade you dropped out from in school. Go do what you like, if you don't have the money borrow loan or something. Seriously mate, you are still 19. You can do a lot to recover yourself. Just set a goal and get to it. Then set another and then another. Work hard for it."

medicine,f5q48j6,t1_f5q2lau,1572372312.0,I was going back to my room from college. We are required to wear a white apron in college and I couldn't really put it in my bag since it would have gotten more dirty.
medicalschool,f5q25il,t3_dorpbu,1572371420.0,It's like saying you shouldn't try to find cure for cancer because it's keeping the population in check.
