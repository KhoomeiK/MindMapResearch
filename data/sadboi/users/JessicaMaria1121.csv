mentalhealth,f4ug74i,t3_dltqvd,1571809311.0,"First of all stop thinking about what if's.. or beating yourself up about certain decisions (easier said than done I know) 
You took a leap of faith with this girl, and eventhough it didn't turn out well it's still something to be proud of. 

I have been feeling extremely unmotivated for the last year, I try watching motivational videos on YouTube, or listening to upbeat music to kinda hype me up.. it works most of the time but not always. I also try making a to do list, but instead of a ""must do"" I try to make it a ""I want to do atleast ... today"" which helps take the pressure off a little and makes the tasks seem less daunting. 

I still procrastinate a lot, beat myself up and then feel worse than I did. But I still do it, I'd rather lay in bed all day than deal with the world most days.. on some occasions I can force myself to go to work/school but other days I can't. 
I'll call in sick / cancel plans and end up feeling guilty the entire day wishing I would've pushed through. 

I hope you find your motivation to live a fulfilling life again.. and I hope the same for myself too."
