im14andthisisdeep,fr1v0d0,t1_fr0x8ac,1589826413.0,"He's sad because he realized this is not what he wanted. He's sad because he's left unfulfilled. His heart is still empty. He wonders, ""Why? Isn't this what I've been training for my whole life? Why, still, is it that I suffer?"" He thinks and he ponders the question. He consults his memories, hoping for an answer.

His father trained him to always be the best, and that failure was not to be tolerated, and would result in severe punishment. He remembers every one, each one more painful than the last. This, of course, contributed to a harsh problem with perfectionism.

He remembers being interested in music when he was ten, four years ago. He wanted to play the flute. He practiced in his room every day. It was one of the few things that made him happy. When his father walked in to investigate the noise, he noticed it in the boy's hands. He took it from him, and he smashed it. ""Why the hell are you wasting time on this,"" he said, ""You're not going to get anywhere with that thing!""

He had a revelation: He was not living for himself. His father was living through him. He was alive only for his dad. This is why he was empty. The other boy was his own person, he was just his dad's puppet. The other boy was just happy that his work resulted in him getting something. If he were to have gotten his place, he doesn't know what'd happen to him. Suddenly, he envied for third place."

TrueOffMyChest,fqzdklg,t3_glnsfb,1589765129.0,"YouTube's whole recommendation thing does not cut it for me in general. I suppose it works and is functional, but I don't believe it's very good for finding new content to watch at all. Maybe it's just my recommendations, but I'm very often recommended videos I've already watched before. Maybe it's my tendency to binge channels I like until I've watched every single video, and the system is like   ""t h e y   w a n t   m o r e ,"" which only works until I've seen everything. I think videos that you've seen before should have a 33%-50% lesser chance of popping up in your recommended feed. It can make it frustrating to find content to view sometimes.

Also, maybe I'm spotting something where there's nothing, but I believe leaving a dislike on a video will keep that content and things like it away from your feed. idk, i do it and it seems like it makes a difference"
