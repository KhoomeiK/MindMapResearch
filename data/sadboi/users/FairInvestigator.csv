AskWomenOver30,fqd6uj3,t1_fqctf9p,1589281738.0,"Always masks other emotions. Anger is a defence outer layer because we're scared (2nd layer) because we're sad (3rd layer). If we're sad we can't find as valid a reason to flee like we can when we're scared, and when we're scared we don't feel  powerful like we do in anger. It's defense mechanisms on defense mechanisms on defense mechanisms. The root is always a sadness about something. But without the defensive emotions we have to be vulnerable and that feels risky, it's raw and it's hard. It takes so much courage."

When your base state is generalised anxiety due to prolonged periods of living in a traumatic environment, the 'comfort zone' is the area outside of where you normally feel you are residing. Telling everyone they should venture out of it demonstrates a huge blindspot in understanding the variety present in what progress means for individuals. Especially given the commonality of trauma in a person's background, that we are now aware of (Going through trauma is not rare. About 6 of every 10 men (or 60%) and 5 of every 10 women (or 50%) experience at least one trauma in their lives. - Source: [https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/common/common\_adults.asp](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/common/common_adults.asp)).
