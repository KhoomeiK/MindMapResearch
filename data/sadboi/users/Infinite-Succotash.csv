Cyberpunk,fqvtbu6,t1_fqtf824,1589684713.0,That's a cool summary. Never heard of the neon lights being a compensation for lack of real light before.
Blasphemous,fqerplo,t3_gidoin,1589312491.0,"I'm trying to understand your point, but it starts with what I believe is an error: ""before/after the miracle"". Everything in the game takes place after the events involving El Retorcido and the The Last Son of the Miracle (Escribar) i.e. The Miracle. 

Also, TPOs silence is not a curse. I've never seen any lore that indicated it's anything more than a choice. (Crisanta is ""blinded"", but I dont know if her penance is through the miracle or because she wears a helmet)"

I just skipped this item because I went down the rabbit hole of riding the elevator and didnt figure it out."

Recommend you get the prayers that allow for distance attacks before trying to complete the search."

You are no longer anything but one more anonymous visage, without a voice, without a gesture."
Blasphemous,fpglxo9,t1_fpfuig8,1588605263.0,"The game was very difficult to understand and my purpose was unclear from the start. Also, the game is just too hard ( I know this is what some people enjoy but I dont). When I lose 5 to 10 times against the most basic creatures in the game I'm not having fun. 

I wasn't pleased with the controls either. They seemed pointlessly counterintuitive.

Edit 1: I also dont really enjoy games that don't have tangible progress. I didn't have a good sense of that in Dark Souls."
Blasphemous,fpbaeae,t3_g9m20z,1588465564.0,I despise dark souls but I was willing to drag my balls over glass through this game. The religious storytelling and nihilistic cruelty drew me in. Mysterious are the ways of the Miracle!

socialskills,fmnqy34,t3_fwcjru,1586232843.0,"Yes. For reasons unknown to those involved, many people dont get along.  Causes may very well be based on cultural assumptions, moral code, ethics, or status as it relates to societal standing or workplace hierarchy.  

Impressions of individuals are often formed immediately and rarely changed.  Your work environment may heavily affect this.

Acceptance of peoples' core qualities is crucial to working with them. Dont apologize for or change yours, but maintain professional and mature conduct."
