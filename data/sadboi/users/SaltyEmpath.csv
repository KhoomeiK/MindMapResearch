Anxiety,fleh8hd,t1_fldnsc0,1585084344.0,"Yes yes yes!!! Last night I brushed my teeth, walked to the bed, laid down, and suddenly couldn’t breathe. I didn’t run laps but it felt like it - but I had been anxious all night. It wasn’t until I laid down that suddenly I couldn’t get air. I took huge gasps and deep breaths, counting inhales and exhales, taking my pulse, trying to stop yawning and wishing my lungs could inflate. I’m picking up and Alpha-Stim from my counselor tomorrow. She swears it will save me during all this anxiety. Chronic health issues, PTSD, and some serious cabin fever have been compounding the normal issues. Thank you for posting."

TrueCrimePodcasts,f3a115g,t3_dg585k,1570759453.0,"I had the same problem. After the first episode I got sucked in. At the end I had to stop listening because of the kids involved, but yeah it’s very well done once you get past the first episode."
infj,f38mrfe,t1_f38jp1w,1570737958.0,And short term memory gets completely shot. It’s like tug of war to stay present so you can absorb what’s you’re hearing or reading.
infj,f38izc7,t1_f38inal,1570736992.0,Yeah that is familiar too. I will have read pages of a book with no memory of it. Or driven home without much memory of it. Honestly some days I find myself subconsciously seeking that dissociation for relief.

They do a deep dive into the files and whatever they find, they report on. It’s just the most well-presented podcast I think I’ve ever heard."

ptsd,ezzxlfl,t3_d34ufu,1568294365.0,"I relate to this so much. For me, working out until I'm out of energy really helps. I also have been using VR goggles lately and disappearing into a forest or a beach setting. It's really therapeutic and makes you feel like you're somewhere else. Occasionally I just have to get numb and go to sleep. Keep at the therapy... unloading it really helps. Journaling also helps, although it's the hardest thing in the world for me to make myself do."
ptsd,ezzx19b,t1_ezzniv7,1568294129.0,"Absolutely to all of this. We don't have to fully understand the trigger in order to stop and ask why your partner is struggling. If you aren't trying to understand and learn about your partner, what is it all about? It's hard to stay calm when people put up boundaries to us. But if he is just entitled to whatever, that indeed is a big red flag."
ptsd,ezzwm1w,t3_d360bi,1568293983.0,"Ohhhh love. I've had similar situations happen in the past. You are NEVER crazy. You DESERVE boundaries. If your bf can't react calmly with a ""how can I understand this better"" type of attitude, he is not the safe kind of partner you need while you deal with PTSD. Sure he may have been embarrassed or triggered, but most likely he was just reacting to boundaries that made him uncomfortable. If your bf makes you go into ""frozen"" mode (I call this numb mode, where my ears are ringing and I can't really concentrate and I just zone out), he either needs to get real educated real quick, or gtfo. I'm in the middle of a very difficult PTSD week, and my partner is incredibly understanding... as far as accommodating my quiet time, helping with the kids, bringing me some food, etc. However, he takes it personally a lot of the time and we have to have open conversations, CALMLY, about my struggles and how they affect him. Your mental health and recovery and boundaries are all that matters. If this guy loves you, he'll calm tf down and try to understand."
infj,ezzvdsq,t1_ezzc6j0,1568293488.0,"YES. This is a new eureka for me lately, and I'm so glad someone else is thinking on the same lines."
