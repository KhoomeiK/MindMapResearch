You could say that yes, we don’t know how many people have and beat COVID-19 without symptoms, but the same goes for the flu — we don’t know how many people have the flu undetected either. Even if the number is smaller than 1 in 5, it still has a loooooooong way to go to being anywhere close to 9 in 100,000, or what the actual flu value is."
OSU,fk3lnbl,t1_fk3ch8c,1583838858.0,"The fact of the matter is that this situation is more concerning because there is a higher risk. Ignoring the fatality rate, the number of people who require hospitalization is the major concern. The CDC reported that last year, [9.1 per 100,000 people were hospitalized for the flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/flu-season-updates-2018.htm). Meanwhile, the Coronavirus has a rate of [1 out of 5 people needing hospital treatment](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses).

This is where the danger lies — yes, Coronavirus on it’s own isn’t that dangerous. Most people can fight it off. But when millions of people have it and hospitals become overwhelmed, the real damage begins. We need to limit exposure to prevent this scenario and unnecessary suffering that will not occur if the amount of people who have the illness is fewer."

One of the first passages labeled it as, “the greatest school tragedy to ever occur” and I’m sorry I doubted it. Couldn’t stomach more than reading about 15 pages. I’d heard of this tragedy (as a reference for why doors always open outward) but didn’t know it was in Cleveland. It was far, far more horrific than I realized.

If you’ve got a morbid sense of curiosity like me and want a taste, one of the most graphic images mentioned was >!a father finding his 8 year old daughter stuck on the other side of a door, and as the other children are trampling her and the flames are beginning to eat them, she’s begging her father to save her, “Daddy, daddy, pull me out.” He tries to pull her free only to rip her arm off and watch her fall back into the pile of crushed, burning children. There’s a pile of other children’s hands and arms that were ripped off in vain by other parents in a similar fashion sitting in front of the door. !<

There aren’t words, I could never imagine that happening — let alone seeing it 165 times in a row. I’m now super grateful for all those annoying fire drills I did as a kid, but damn, I’m not going to bed anytime soon. Terrible tragedy but great historical resource, OP."

Cleveland,fi8j95c,t1_fi71jf5,1582241538.0,"Absolutely. They had themed tents last year and each one was a riot for kids to climb/crawl/run through. Huge, climb-able sculptures, “experience” activities like a wind tunnel that simulates the wind power of skydiving or an underwater ocean scene. You’re encouraged to touch things throughout the festival so you don’t have to worry about your kids getting too excited and causing damage, which is a really awesome concept. They also had a whole play tent just for kids with lots of different play and craft stations. On top of that, they had people twirling fire batons, making ice sculptures. All of that right below the glowing Cleveland skyline sounds like it would make a great childhood memory — I think it would be an absolute blast to take the kiddos to.

edit: also a ton of music for your kids to dance too so they tire themselves out and all asleep on the ride home! plenty of space at the back of the crowd at most of the stages where you can still hear/see but your kids can have space to goof around. what’s not to love?!

edit 2: also I felt like there was very ready parking in the area. if you need to run to the car and re-enter it’s not a big deal at all. the more I think about it I really wanna bring my nieces and nephews this year.
