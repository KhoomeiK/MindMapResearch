I’d say the Republican Party at the least enabled trump could have done a lot by now to censure him but enabling is encouragement so it’s absolutely the rights fault.

The second amendment is a religion to people. And it’s not unfair to say that those people are Republicans and make up the gun owners.

And then I can extrapolate further Republicans arent as scared of the virus. They thought it was a hoax and even now that it’s being blown out of proportion.  So once again don’t be scared of the virus be scared of Democrats go buy guns"
