SuicideWatch,ffwqoau,t1_ffwp4k1,1580308673.0,"Can I say ew? Your boss sounds disgusting. I'll do some research on klonopin, as I've never heard of it before. Your ex sounds pretty gross too. What horrible beings you've had to deal with. Yuck.

I haven't a clue about life in America (I'm not from there), so all my knowledge of there is from tv, which I've heard is very inaccurate. I was going to ask about welfare/unemployment, hence I prefaced the question with this. What about libraries? What about planned parenthood? What do they offer? Again, I'm speaking from foreigner's ignorance, forgive me. 

Your mom sounds...like an effort to deal with. Bit gross tbh. No offence meant. 

Is there anything offered in Tennessee to help those who aren't currently employed? 

And, can I commend you on your care for your animals? You are such a caring person. Have you thought of pet care or volunteering? You sound like you have the desposition for it. 

I'm currently 24, no plans yet either. I'm new to unemployment as I've been in school for almost 20 years (give or take). So I can understand your dejection. 

If there's anyone with the area who knows something, I wish they respond.

And your hope for therapy, I understand that too well.

I hope something works out or that an idea sparks in."
SuicideWatch,ffwnxwv,t1_ffwmb78,1580306654.0,"I am not a specialist (nor am I in any way, shape or form a person to give diagnoses) but it sounds like anxiety/panic causing the numbness. I've experienced two instances of it and I'd not wish it on anyone. 

Your body is in constant fight or flight, so rest is seen as you not being diligent enough. Only thing I can ask you is seek treatment for it, at least just to ease your mind. It sounds like ptsd in a way.

I'm so sorry life dealt you such an unfair hand. You have seen and experienced so much injustice. Your ex and your mom are just, wow. I'm so very sorry you had to deal with them at all. My condolences on your mema's passing. She sounds like she was a wonderful person to you.

Thor senses your distress and wants his very best to comfort you. He wants you to see him and only him, as he believes that he can ease all aches in your heart.

Life often kicks us when we're down and the storms in our minds reinforce it. I'm not gonna say ""but it gets better"" and lure you into a false sense of security or hope, but, with effort (a painful amount of breaking down and resetting, therapy and un-learning the crap life has fed us) it becomes a bit easier to cope. 

It's not a quick fix or a ""thanks I'm cured"" thing, I'll not deceive you with all that ""toxic positivity"", but, staying for the journey, what things would you like to find out about yourself? What skills/hobbies would you like to develop?

And, can I ask, how can you get your pets back from your mom's ""care""? Can you ask an officer for assistance to help relocate them to your care? I know usually you can do so, if you believe they are in danger."

Not trying to sound cheesy, with the cheerful ""you matter"" thing (it's unhelpful and disingenuous and insulting) especially when you aren't feeling your best, but think about how Thor sees you, as his best human, no strings attached. 

He isn't thinking about how to manipulate you into a corner or how you should reflect his ideals. He loves you for who you are and that's all that matters. His love without judgement. 

I'm not sure about human connection, the universe or religion, but pets often take us as the centre of their universe. That's a love we should cherish."

You said that it feels pathetic to post because you've been told that you're feelings are pathetic, but I have to say, you aren't. Doing this, writing this post, baring all to internet strangers, is a very strong thing to do. 

Despite of all of the abuse you've suffered, you choose to be kind. That's a very brave and non-pathetic thing to do.

My mother too has been through hell and back, so she has been hardened by life, and wants me to be the same, but I honestly can't. My sister and I talk as strangers, during my childhood she wasn't ideal for my fragile mental health, so I understand that. 

I went to therapy for a few days and it wasn't all that I needed. I was expected to heal from years worth of trauma in weeks. I understand the concern of not finding the right therapist, but I am desperate to find one that fits. Maybe we can try together?  

Your response sounds so much like my life and it's disconcerting a bit. Sorry to make this a ""me"" response, but I do understand, to a scary degree, what you have endured. 

The part of your response about peace, I feel it. Deeply. But I realised that it was about the scenery I was in. The abandonment from my mom and siblings, even though they're physically here. I started my own version of therapy by trawling reddit subs and its eye opening. 

It may sound shallow, but please, do so as well. Itemise all the hurt that you have and research into it. Sometimes the therapists we need are ourselves. In time, if/when you are ready, go to a therapist. I hope you find the one that you need.

I hope that you can update to suit. I may not be what you need, but I care. Those who have taken time to respond care. We'd like to hear more from you. Lots of love to you OP."

What if you freed yourself without having to die? What if opening up helps you find a group of people like you, with similar hopes and hurts? It's okay to feel adrift, but, please, don't set yourself free to the wind. Cry out your despair to the wind, free that hurt to the wind.
