ABCDesis,fr2674n,t3_gm3yvu,1589831835.0,I’m an Indian girl who also was bullied and tormented only by other Indian girls. Honestly they were some of the meanest and hardest to deal with. It really is sad and I’m sorry you dealt with it. It gave me a tough shell but also has prevented me from being able to be friends with Indian people. When I got to college I found myself only around non-Indians. I find that the brown people are some of the most judgmental and rude sometimes. I hate that they’ve treated me like shit
AsianParentStories,fr23xfx,t1_fr1dqeb,1589830729.0,Oh man. I’m sorry to hear that but you should be proud of yourself on getting into nursing school!! Congrats to you. Asian parents are never satisfied I feel that. My parents were happy because I got into a top university but otherwise i don’t know how they’d have felt. It’s like no matter what you’re screwed. Just know you aren’t alone
AsianParentStories,fr1co85,t1_fr1c3tx,1589817391.0,You’re absolutely right about her wanting to brag to her social group. It’s all about appearance to her. She loves to compare me with other people from my high school and say “you’re such a disappointment look at how good these other people are”. I’m just so tired from all of it. No matter what I ever do it’s not good enough for her. I’ve already gone as little contact as I can but she’ll go off on me about how I don’t call or facetime her. It’s like there’s no winning.

Growing up, I never really felt any connection to Hinduism or truly like I believed anything. As I got older that went away even more. I love reading Hindu philosophy and scripture because it’s interesting but it’s hard for me to believe in it. I would consider myself an agnostic. My mom refuses to accept it but I’ve told her many times about where I stand. I was never into the ritualistic aspects of Hinduism either but I can understand how it could bring people peace."

I graduated from university last year but if I was in school with everything going on in the world right now, I don’t think I’d be able to focus and stay motivated either. Parents don’t understand (esp brown parents) don’t see why it would be difficult and have little sympathy. Don’t worry that’s how mine were. Just work as hard as you can, score the best you can do on those AP exams, and try earning as much college credit. Do you plan on moving out of home for college? Perhaps that’s something you can look forward to. You’ll have independence soon! I hope things get better for you. School isn’t easy, but hang in there!"
