The bottle even looks the same. Also, if you go to an Aveda store they will make you Cherry Almond Bark in a wearable oil. I had them make an oil out of their Shampure shampoo."

BPD,fnzz1ya,t1_f7lfuym,1587403226.0,"Your comment gave me so many feels. I used to feel this way constantly when I was younger. I hope I can offer you this feeling of consolation – when you get older it subsides, at least it did for me. I’m 42. When I was younger I would go NUTS if I didn’t get a reply(text, Facebook, Friendster, my Lord, I’m old). I don’t get bothered by this at all anymore. It seriously does not even phase me. I know that annoying feeling where you can’t control yourself because you get so angry because someone hasn’t replied. It doesn’t exist for me anymore."

relationship_advice,eyzn28l,t3_czhvrp,1567621390.0,"I have been in this exact situation except I was the girl who cheated. I took a bottle of pills and ended up in a coma. This is not your fault. After I recovered physically and emotionally I realized that the break-up was just a catalyst for my suicide attempt. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I had been going through a severe depression for many months before the break up, and I had been drinking heavily and avoiding responsibilities, and there were many other things going on with me. It took me many years to get over things with my ex. Sometimes I still might think I love him. But I never blamed it on him because it’s just not his fault. You had every right to be angry with her for what she did because she hurt you to the core and most people express hurt as anger. You had no control over the situation. I know that you never thought that she would do this. I cried wolf several times, but she didn’t. You never even had a chance to talk to her and you had no idea that she was planning on doing this. Please do not blame yourself. Please. And please get yourself into therapy because this is going to be a very hard time for you. I am so sorry for everyone involved in this. Life is just... so hard."
