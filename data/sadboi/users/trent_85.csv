theravada,fg12urm,t1_fg0m42n,1580419719.0,"Sure thing. Sorry, I was trying to be a bit funny with my original comment.

My understanding is as follows. The Buddha likened consciousness to a fire. Death is kind of like when a fire goes out. Where does the fire go when it goes out? Well, it doesn't go anywhere. It just ceases to be. Similarly, one could ask where the fire comes from. It doesn't come from anywhere. It arises from the conditions present if they're conducive. If fuel, oxygen, and a spark are all present at the same time, fire arises. If whatever is necessary for consciousness (I honestly don't know what this consists of yet) is present, it arises. Buddhists make a technical distinction between the terms reincarnation and rebirth. Reincarnation is what the Hindus and Christians believe in. They believe in an eternal spirit that is independent of the body. The Christians just believe the body reincarnates once after death, in either heaven or hell. Most Buddhists don't believe in a permanent spirit that exists beyond the body. I like to refer to this continuity of consciousness as inertia because, just as an object in motion tends to stay in motion, a thinking mind tends to want to continue thinking. I believe what gets transferred after death is the habits, the attachments, the clinging to life. The word nirvana literally means ""to blow out"" as in a fire. The Buddha taught that, if a person removes the conditions for rebirth, they have ""blown out"" their fire. He said that a living person that has achieved the understanding of nirvana is like a bed of hot coals. There isn't a fire there, but there is something that can still interact with the world. Once the enlightened person dies, it's like a bed of coals gone completely cold, never to ignite a fire again."

They had sex once just to see what it was like, and both decided that, while it wasn't repulsive, it just didn't do anything for them, so they haven't done it since. Me, I'm wired to have a higher libido than average. I'm Buddhist, and believe me I wish it was an urge I could easily ignore, but it is what it is. Sex is so prominent in our society because it sells to people like me, but I'm actually an outlier. Most people have average libido so only respond moderately. The rest are below average and respond less so. Thing is, that makes you the quiet majority, so if you're not responding, then the market analysis won't notice you. It is perfectly fine and okay do have a different level of sexual desire. The important thing is that you're happy. If your libido is making you unhappy, a doctor can help.
