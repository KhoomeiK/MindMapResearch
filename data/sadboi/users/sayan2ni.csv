BPD,f7yj31y,t3_dy4kav,1574096001.0,"no, you mustn't quit. think about the aftermath every time you want to quit. the aftermath is worse."
BPD,f7yifu9,t3_dy56wa,1574095679.0,same here :(
BPD,f2fsf9l,t3_ddc9pg,1570222007.0,"why are we like this, though :( :( :( ... i can relate"
kolkata,f2fdc4n,t3_dcs6v5,1570215553.0,yep
BPD,eukd205,t3_cgnt9e,1563886650.0,calm the fuck down. doing anything drastic will only add to more fuckups.
BPD,ets5nhd,t3_cczifc,1563137129.0,"yeah... this is typical of BPD. Sometimes while writing in my journal, i refer to myself as 'I' and then somehow shift to refering to myself as 'You' and the as 'we' .. this is weird, it's like midway between writing down stuff, i have separated myself from the body and am instructing the person that is writing through a separate self."
BPD,ets5bn5,t3_ccztps,1563136901.0,"from what i gathered of your description and similar experiences of mine, this might be our BPD selves reaching a sort of non-reality during the hours of the night. it's a sinister calling that we're almost beginning to feel we have found ourselves during these hours. but there is supposed to be no 'self' and that this is a neverending search. maybe, just maybe, entering this state of non-reality(where you feel detached from the sounds of cars and people, which is actually the real world) is harmful?"
BPD,ets4ttc,t3_cczvwy,1563136553.0,strange.. it's the same with me but only every winter. i'm beginning to dread the oncoming of these marked seasons.
BPD,ets3kc7,t3_cd6asz,1563135651.0,"Just out of curiosity, what was your vondition beefore the treatment began and compared to it right now after the treatment, do you notice improvement?"
BPD,ets39ty,t3_cd7eeh,1563135446.0,"In a way, yes, I feel terribly homesick while on a trip, and haven't figured out why. It's like being separated from home makes me lonely, that ultimately ruins the fun of the trip. As you said, sleeping in a bed different from the comfort zone adds to the anxiety. This happens too."
BPD,epvxvus,t1_epvxp67,1559557491.0,"can't you randomly inititate a phone call to reconnect with old friends? sometimes all it takes is a piece of text or an unexpected phone call to warm people up, make them smile and remember that you used to be friends with this person."
BPD,epvxnrk,t3_bw8ysh,1559557154.0,"me too. except for colleagues, who do not give a shit outside office hours. do you really have no friends or do you think you dont have friends but there are actually people around you who care?"
