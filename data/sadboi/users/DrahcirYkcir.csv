Loneliness takes many different shapes and forms, and just because you do certain things and experience it one way doesn't mean it's invalid for other people who have experienced it differently. It doesn't help that the internet has become a more open breeding ground just to shitpost and attack each other with memes and 'edgy' comments.

Could do w/o his mom though. Thought it was unnecessary and rather unusual, and I think she was holding him back a little. She was more miserable than he was when they got the boot!"

TheCircleTV,fejjhe2,t1_feiq098,1579176858.0,"Well think about shows like Survivor where there's 16+ contestants from the get-go. Sure some of them hardly get an edit (that's a fault of the producers making edit cuts), but on a whole they were all managed.

Interestingly, I didn't think I'd like Joey as much in the beginning and I loved Shubham in the beginning, but after the first couple episodes I ended up rooting for Joey the most and then Shubham.

I really enjoyed all of the final cast, but the top two were my absolute favorites. I hope Shubham wins favorite player."
TheCircleTV,feip91w,t1_feilbaq,1579143827.0,"Oh yeah. He would've looked like a bloody fool if he was wrong. It was just a bit obsessive that almost every time it showed him it was like ""Rebecca ain't real"" as if that was his only personality."

It's harder to fit in a preestablished social circle, but ""easier"" to win because of the less days. Maybe a statement on social media in general?"

Adding new players later into the game is not exactly smart or fair even if they end up with a reduced cash prize or struggle to fit in more. A fair game has everyone on a level playing field."

TheCircleTV,fdf0h4n,t3_ejuxv5,1578350533.0,"I couldn't stand him and I rooted against him almost every episode. He was far too melodramatic and a generally negative person.

That said, he did get somewhat better as the series went on and I heard he chilled out since the programme ended, so if that's the case great for him!"

I wasn't impressed with the games this year. There were some repeats again (Chivalry, which I think has been added in almost every JJ and in several past bundles), some rebundled games (Pac Man CE2), quite a few DLCs and coupons to get you to buy games (though not as bad as last year), and a lot of the later games just looked random and obscure just to add quantity.
