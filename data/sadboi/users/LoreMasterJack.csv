progun,fpjfvwo,t1_fpjdo1g,1588666980.0,"We‚Äôve been embroiled in a ground war with civilian soldiers in the Middle East almost as long as I‚Äôve been alive.

In the revolutionary war we won because of our knowledge of local land and foreign assistance from France. With next to no government stability and no supplies or funds, our forefathers resisted and expelled a global superpower. 

In the Vietnam War, despite having an overwhelming infrastructureral advantage with an absolute monster of a disciplined army bolstered by drafted conscripts who were given ample training and an absolutely ludicrous amount of gear, intelligence, air support, chemical warfare, and a scorched earth tactical approach; we lost. We lost due to many factors including political pressures from both abroad and domestic to terminate the war but the campaign in Vietnam was supposed to take a fraction of the time it took for disapproval to reach it‚Äôs zenith. The Vietcong, despite receiving equipment from their allies, won that war largely with punji sticks and ambushes.

Anyone that thinks that the military is some unstoppable force has probably spent very little time familiar with it. We strive to have the worlds foremost experts and cutting edge technological developments and we spend more than any other nation to maintain the worlds largest standing army. That army is a minuscule fraction compared to the population of the United States. Most soldiers would have qualms turning on their countrymen and defection is a very real buffer to turning on your own civilians. Compound that with the fact that there are more guns than people in America. 

Our country has witnessed first hand several times how the defensive warfare of attrition and ambush can throw even the strongest of armies into disarray. I hope that you fight for your legal constitutional right to equip yourselves with the gear and ammunition necessary to form a well regulated militia of citizen soldiers for the express purpose of defending liberty and resisting tyranny. It is far from futile to do so."
