suggestmeabook,f4ryzuv,t1_f4qptbj,1571772918.0,"This is one of my favorite books, if not my all time favorite. It's about humanity and happiness and it resonated with me in so many ways. Made me contemplate my own happiness and frustrations and everything in between."
depression,f4ozryg,t3_dlar06,1571712203.0,It’s progress and I’m happy for you! It’s always good to have things to look forward to. I also might be biased because I am a dog lover and my dog brings me so much joy.
depression,f4oydiu,t3_dlar06,1571711231.0,I’m excited for you!!!
Psychic,f4oewtz,t3_dl8gzo,1571700610.0,Quick response with a good brief explanation (not just a basic yes or no). Thank you! :)
depression,f47m55v,t3_djovhq,1571424309.0,You should be proud! And I’m proud of you. :)
Needafriend,f3oj98k,t3_dhfzyt,1571019416.0,"29F here from the US! I’m an ISFJ at heart but become more of an INFJ when it comes to my work and in conflict. I’m in grad school and working part time as a TA (I enjoy it but the pay is terrible). I like reading, running/walking, and just spending quality time with my loved ones. I like animals and love dogs. No kids of my own but I have 2 young nephews who I love more than anything and who I help watch occasionally. Totally looking for someone to make a friendly connection with. Let’s be friends!"
Psychic,f3mbgcs,t1_f3lysab,1570985884.0,"That’s the one! I actually sent them the stuff they asked for (like a dummy). They eventually told me they weren’t doing anymore readings, but then they posted again shortly after that? Also noticed that they were deleting their previous posts, so I couldn’t see any feedback from other users. 

Reached out to a random person who’d responded to a post and they said that the person offered to do a spell or something for a fee. 

Super sketchy."
depression,f2p89qp,t3_ddw4xj,1570339061.0,I’m so so sorry. Is there anyone at all who you can reach out to or go see?
depression,f277u0w,t3_dca26k,1570032408.0,"I’m 29, and I’m starting to think that we never stop trying to just figure shit out. And like someone else said, there’s no timeline for when we need to do things. Some people will graduate really early and some go to college later. Doesn’t mean one is better than the other. 

People change careers even later on after working for a while. I know it’s easy to compare to our friends or other people around us, but you totally have time. You’re still young and it’s normal for people to take more years to graduate (if that’s the path they choose). I finished in 5 years, my brother finished in 7. I know others who took longer. I know people who didn’t graduate and are doing great. Whatever you decide, you still have time."
depression,f276ezz,t3_dc6dap,1570031580.0,"Yep! Lost weight and it’s noticeable, even with the forced eating. I’ve even started looking into weight gainers since food is no longer something that I enjoy."
depression,f276821,t3_dcb40b,1570031473.0,I remember reading your last post. I didn’t respond to it because I saw it 6 hours after and you weren’t responding anymore. My heart sank and I assumed the worst. I am really happy to see that you’re here.
CasualConversation,f264wf8,t3_dc2427,1569993587.0,"Haven’t completely wiped my Facebook but I have deactivated it a few times (for months to over a year each time). Similarly, I’ve had my account since 2005 or so. Honestly, I didn’t miss it after deactivating it. Even now, I have an active account but hardly ever log in. The only thing keeping me from totally deleting it at this point is that I am afraid of losing contact with certain people! But you’re right about how the most important people can be reached in other ways. :)"
depression,f25r9y2,t1_f25bcj7,1569981743.0,"And that’s fine! I’m sure they’re happy just to have you there. My friends know about my struggle with depression and they’re always glad just to get me out with them. And if you are enjoying yourself, with or without being too talkative, then I think that’s ok."
suggestmeabook,f257ew5,t1_f24yaab,1569967679.0,"Yes! This is one of my favorites. Wholesome, comforting fantasy."
depression,f24ohml,t3_dbw0ab,1569956837.0,Yay!!! I'm excited for you!
depression,f24ku3u,t3_dbt5ps,1569954594.0,"Wow, this is EXACTLY how it's been for me! It's not that I haven't laughed and smiled with my friends in the past, but lately it feels like there is some sort of weight holding me down. It's not that I don't enjoy being with my friends. I still love them and am happy to see them, but I just don't have the energy to do more than enjoy the company, to actively contribute and joke around."
CasualConversation,f20vanl,t3_dbed2p,1569864523.0,Woo! Congratulations! That's awesome :)

depression,f1xaoo2,t3_dazu2b,1569795926.0,Excited for you! Good luck and hope that it helps.
overcoming,f1qh5o8,t3_da0gw0,1569700675.0,"I am so sorry that you're going through this, and to hear about your therapist. I really hope that you can find a new one soon. I think one of the best ways to deal with it is just to talk about it.

I feel similarly (going through the motions, sort of in a fog). I know that my experiences and reasons for doing things are likely not the same as yours, but for me, it's the little things that help. I try to find just one thing that I can be grateful for each day, no matter how small. Some days, I'm grateful to have a roof over my head. A couple weeks ago, I was literally grateful for a bagel. I have little to no appetite and no longer enjoy food the way that I used to, so the fact that I enjoyed eating a bagel was a big deal for me. 

Finding new things to experience seem to also help me. Lately, I have started reading. It's a good distraction for me, and unlike with Netflix marathons, I can take books with me to read wherever I'd like. This past week, I started going to my local library. I found myself wanting to go and getting excited about it. It's just a short trip from home, and I'm not even there for long, but it felt like a breakthrough, like I was peaking through the fog a bit. Just finding something that can get me excited, something to look forward to, is a win. It could be going somewhere, eating a certain food that you like, seeing a friend, watching a show, anything. Anything at all, no matter how small, that can get me excited helps with breaking through the fog, even if it's just for a moment.

These are just things that have helped me. There are still days where I want to just curl up alone in my room with all the lights off and cry (and I actually do this sometimes). Sometimes I try to fight it. Other times, I just let myself feel it until I can talk to someone, and then the feeling passes. I hope that things get better for you soon."
depression,f1p5t9x,t1_f1p50xj,1569672965.0,Thank you so much. It’s a struggle in so many ways (and I struggle with expressing my feelings as well!). I hope the same for you.
depression,f1p5olc,t1_f1p4kmi,1569672864.0,"Exactly! For me people think of it as just being sad. That’s part of it, sure, but it’s more than that. I always feel like there’s this cloud over me, this weight that pulls me down, and this strange emptiness. And they think that I will just magically be happy one day and it will be gone. Like it’s just a mood.

I admit that I am trying. I see a therapist, force myself to exercise and eat certain foods, do daily affirmations (still don’t believe them), etc. I even started joining book clubs in an effort to have new experiences. But sometimes it’s like I am just putting on an act to please everyone else so they don’t see me being anything other than happy."
depression,f1p4lql,t1_f1otjuw,1569672028.0,"I think it is comforting to not be alone in this, so for that I want to say thank you."
Psychic,f0zx5zf,t3_d7b0gl,1569104185.0,This came at just the right time. Thank you so much.
AskReddit,ezwl7z5,t3_d2poj6,1568219250.0,"My therapist told me that I’m depressed. 

Best because I now understand what this heavy cloud that I’ve had hanging over me is. 

Worst because, well, I have depression."
raisedbynarcissists,ey7n3u7,t1_ey7jzvi,1566890577.0,I like this a lot! Something we do in our relationship is tell each other “I want attention” or something along those lines. It has worked pretty well for the most part. It’s when we are fighting or going through rough patches that it gets a little tough.
Psychic,exwxbxl,t3_cupk68,1566626670.0,"How are things looking for me in terms of my career opportunities? Will I find direction soon???

Psychic,ex3fdxt,t3_cra41e,1565984690.0,Good solid reading! Picked up on the emotions that were at play in my situation and gave some great advice.
Psychic,ex3a535,t3_cp8e7r,1565982391.0,I would love a reading. I'm facing a lot of uncertainty right now and could use some answers.
