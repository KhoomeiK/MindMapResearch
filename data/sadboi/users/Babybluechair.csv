FortWorth,fr4ue1n,t1_fr4lzck,1589897061.0,"I lost my job for the reason you listed here and I disagree with you. We're not lucky to have some of these jobs. Those employers were lucky to have us. Employers are responsible for their employees safety, that's why we have OSHA. You can't just expect all employees to sacrifice themselves or bills be damned, and America should be better than that. You can't outsource everything from here either. My company was trying to do it but there's just some things people who don't live here cannot understand or replicate with the same quality. 

At the end of the day though, my employer was one among many in Dallas in my field, and so far my contacts have provided me opportunities with much better companies. I'm going to work for a company who overall treats their employees better (at least what I can tell from their covid response) and also pays better! So I guess employees can pick and choose the best employer. They're not better just because they happen to be one who prioritizes safety, the fact that they prioritize safety shoes how much stronger of a company they are. One follows suit over the other."

You'll just highlight one or two features of yours, and won't look super different, and if you're comfortable with that and feel pretty, leave it on and hang out at home all done up! That'll help you get used to having it on, and once you're more comfortable you can do the same but go out like that.

Ofc: you don't have to wear makeup if you don't want to! The best way to improve your appearance is to smile! (And by keeping good hygiene)"

It may not be the same as a gym but I recommend working out some of these feelings. It may make them more bearable after you've gotten some adrenaline out.

You may be able to start making small steps for yourself? Even if only small steps to improve your home life, that way you can try not to lose steam? 

I'm looking at this time as my ""maintenance phase"" because I can't gym and lift weights. And even though that's gym terminology, it can apply to you as well! Maintain that attitude, keep an eye on what's in your best interests, and see this time as a new challenge for yourself."
