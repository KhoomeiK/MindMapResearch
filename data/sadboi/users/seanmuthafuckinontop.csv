I made us beautiful salads but for some reason we thought it was odd. My mother came out some time later and we told her the lettuce seemed weird (I bet you can guess where this is going). Alas, it was a head of cabbage."

I mean I know this isn’t the worst thing in the world, and at least us healthy people still have our lives wether we be unemployed or not....but can we at least agree it sucks regardless?  To me he’s complaining about the same things all regular people are complaining of.  Lack of work (not necessarily loss of income due to unemployment), lack of socializing, and not being able to go out to regular hangouts and/or restaurants. We all know it’s for the greater good, but it still sucks. I think people are bored and are grasping at straws here.   Joe has always been about talking shit with friends and being the self professed idiot asking questions. Why should he have to change that just because he has a larger following now? 
Just cuz he can afford certain things( sauna/float tank/ IV drips) and we can’t...he shouldn’t talk about them? That’s ridiculous. 
Idk man, seems trivial to me."

relationship_advice,eyz3pgy,t3_czhvrp,1567608829.0,"My family went through a similar situation. My uncle, the happiest man I knew committed suicide. He was the fun uncle who was single and had a lot of money because he worked all the time. Taught me how to ski, took me on my first roller coaster, took me on tons of trips. He was my best friend for a long time. He had trouble finding a girlfriend because he was deaf, but wanted a family terribly. Eventually when I was in my early 20s he found the one. She was deaf as well and they seemed like they were in love, although my family had reservations about her. That being said we knew how it meant to him and wanted him to be happy. They got married and he had a child. The most beautiful little girl. He loved her so deeply. Then something changed and his mental health fell apart. My mom is a therapist and did everything she could to get him help, but him being deaf made it difficult to find out exactly what he was feeling. She even tried admitting him, but the hospital cleared him after a day. He died 24 hrs later. 
After he passed his place of employment cleared his locker and gave the contents to my grand mother. In the locker was USB with screenshots of my aunt sending very abusive messages to him, telling him he was a worthless father, husband, etc. My family hated her, wanted to blame her, some did. My grandfather still hates her, but we love the child too much to risk losing her, so he keeps his mouth shut. 
Things have gotten better over the years. I still dont like to look at her in the eyes, but will give her a hug at events. I'll do anything to make sure I get to see his daughter.

You did nothing wrong. You did what was right. People are very hurt and confused right now, and they're going to look at anyone and anything to blame. Itll get better. I'm so sorry for you. Good luck!"

facepalm,exaeres,t3_crvuu5,1566106003.0,"I guess by climate he means seasons? He's still wrong either way. Although Maybe I'm wrong, but I believe seasons are due to the earth wobbling due to its axis. In the summer we are pointed more towards the sun and in winter away. That's why its opposite seasons in southern and northern hemispheres. I also believe I've heard Neil Degrasse Tyson say in the northern hemisphere we're actually the furthest away from the sun in summer and it's still hot because of angle of the earth on its axis. I hope I'm right because I've always found it interesting and definitely said it to alot of people in awkward conversations."

AskReddit,eqkeszc,t1_eqjpjg5,1560121693.0,I did this last week. I live in Pennsylvania and wanted to visit my father and get married in Casper. So me and my wife (so cool I can say that now) flew into denver and rented a jeep wrangler for the week. Ended up going all the way to Yellowstone. When I returned it we put 1600 miles on it. It all worked out perfectly. We could go wherever and no one had to take us to and from the airport. I will definitely be doing it again.
