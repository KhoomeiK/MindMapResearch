BlackPeopleTwitter,fjf8e5g,t1_fjf7qkj,1583286477.0,Lol. Who said that? Who in this entire comment section said that? I come from harsh harsh shitty mental and physical abuse and lived with them until I was 20 and with all of the years of reflection I very well know every wrong thing to do with kids. Do I really have to clarify that once a kid is starting to reach social reactions that make them who they are and what they will be that it's important to shape their morals and help in support them both endearingly and with discipline when needed? We don't need more of what the world is now. So it's important to me at least to make sure my kid isn't one of the brain dead people walking around nowadays. Do whatever works for your child and by no means am I saying beat the hell out of them. It doesn't make someone a p.o.s for giving them a couple love taps. And it would take a lot for me to result to that.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fjf6ml7,t1_fjf5izf,1583285415.0,Lol. No. Different kids. Different results. I'm not just talking about spanking. Every kid has a set discipline that works for them. Without discipline and teaching your kids about life and repercussions go ahead and see how that kid turns out.
