BPD,fnehq97,t1_fnb1qve,1586889579.0,That is actually what the last criterion for BPD in the DSM-V defines it as. You’re not wrong. That verbatim of what it says. Be sure to check out my comment to the post. Might help you out as well if you aren’t sure how you usually get out of these episodes. Might spark a memory in a mental process you do subconsciously when getting out of these dyspeptic episode. All the luck to you. Take care.
BPD,fnehcn7,t3_g0puu9,1586889383.0,"Yes, this is a normal thing for me when I’m not constantly busy/working toward a realistic goal. When I get in these moods, I literally think, day and feel everything you’ve listed above as much as I hate breaking down and crying and eventually calling a family member who actually understands my diagnosis, I still do it. You should tell your boyfriend and/or further elaborate on your diagnosis. That it is a very common personality disorder and help him understand what these moods are for you. Meaning, don’t tell me what to do, how to fix it, when you’re in that mood, you don’t want help or anything done or to do anything productive. Everything seems obligatory rather than just normal things you would usually do. Find a consist hobby or interest, FORCE yourself to do it at least once week for 3-4 weeks. Then up the “dose” to 2 times a week every other week, and so on. Try to find something out of you comfort zone and mundane coping skills. You have to repave these mental paths you’ve fallen habit to every time you sense one of these days coming on . Add a fork in the road and take a left instead of a right. If this didn’t work, I wouldn’t be telling you to try it. Once you find a strategy that can get you out of these moods that works for YOU specifically, WRITE IT DOWN. 
Put it in your notes (on your phone, on the fridge, in a notebook that you regularly use, etc.). Next time you feel it coming on even at the slightest, go ahead and have a reminder on your phone already created for these times, schedule it for 1-3 every three hours during these moods so it can literally remind you of what you need to do. Add sub tasks, do what works and keep up the consistency until the “update” on the best computer in the world (your mind/brain) is complete and ready to restart! I REALLY hope this helps. It suckssss being there!! I spent over 3 weeks in a state like that or seasonal depression because I wasn’t keeping myself busy, organized and on a schedule. This is the first step and the rest will follow. You got this!!"
BPD,fn0yu2b,t1_fmwtyvl,1586551419.0,"So what was the context of the advice she was seeking though? She did not mention anything about the quarantine being the reason behind her choices. She was clearly asking for someone to empathize with her concerns about her hypersexual tendencies, which you did not do at all. And then on top of it, you decided to paint this image of her being stupid, careless, and inconsiderate of others, but the other party involved also has a role in this. If they’re not at risk, and are not hanging around children and geriatric, this is the least pressing issue in this thread. Not to mention, your tone was very condescending and apathetic to the matter all together. Again, if you can’t understand how your comment is more hurtful than helpful, you are on the wrong sub Reddit. I’m not gonna diagnose you, but I know this kind of behavior is definitely not a trait of BPD and you should respectfully leave this sub all together."
BPD,fmu5h5w,t1_fmombjj,1586384947.0,"So she’s asking for advice, whether we were in quarantine or not. You sitting her disrespectfully talking down on her is the last thing she needed here. YOU obviously don’t give a fuck about the people on this page and are following the wrong subreddit.
This sub is for BPD patients, not NPD (narcissistic personality disorder) patients. Take your interpersonally exploitive comments elsewhere. They are inappropriate for this sub. And just down right disrespectful. Please just see your way out of this thread."
ChildPsychology,fmo2f8m,t3_fu75ii,1586242917.0,"Yes. If your child is having jealousy issues, they most likely are uncomfortable and/or not happy with themselves. This could be from earlier devlpmt or a recent rejection/disappoint making them feel they weren’t good enough for that so now they are jealous of others and/or their situations that they feel they should also be entitled to. If your child is doing remotely well or better, you need to acknowledge that to them verbally (frequently). This is a confidence issue. They are comparing themselves or their lifestyle to others whom seem more glamorous. Let them no this is not the case and they are special because of who they are. Tell them it’s totally “cooler” to be you, than someone else. If you cannot get through to them with words of affirmation and constant encouragement though, there may be something deeper buried under the surface causing this jealousy. Take them to a child therapist. A younger looking one if possible and a gender that correlates to majority of their peers that they do connect with. This is to better assist in making the child feel comfortable and able to share without fear of judgment or ridicule. I hope this helps figure out which path to take on this. And please, keep me posted.
Take care."
BPD,fmo1b69,t3_fw78zp,1586241803.0,"When I was single, I did this every time. I always wondered why I was this way. Now that I’m hearing this from another BPD person like myself, I think I understand why. Being that we constantly try to avoid abandonment (imagined or real), we probably sleep with someone the first time hanging out in hopes to keep them around? And they don’t stay around because they don’t understand our intentions. We also either are infatuated with someone or greatly disdain them. Maybe we sense that they feel the same way as we want them to feel... BPD also has the major trait of impulsivity. So instead of thinking through something first, we make a decision in the moment without thinking of the consequences. There is a fix that has worked for me like magic. Firstly, CBT. Secondly, actually doing the exercises and THINKING about thinking. Thirdly, a solid daily medication plan for those times where coping skills are not an option given the situation at hand. I am 22 y/o and have a dual diagnosis of bipolar type 2 and BPD. The only thing that CONSISTENTLY works for me is exercising self-awareness and social-awareness in EVERY decision I make. When I go to the store, I make a list and only buy from that list. Before I go to the kitchen, I think about what I want and DECIDE before going in there (helps with binge eating). When I used to drink, I would put only the amount of money I needed for 2-3 drinks. No one else was allowed to buy me drinks to prevent binge drinking. Before I get in the car, I remind myself of what I can expect on the road (other drivers’ behaviors). If you would like to talk about it over message, feel free to shoot me one. BPD is the most difficult personality disorder to treat so you posting this question is already progress. Good luck to you!"
bipolar2,fl5dfua,t3_fmm8cg,1584834147.0,Lamictal is sooo amazing. Been on it consistently and I couldn’t imagine changing back to anything else
bipolar2,fjwzkm1,t3_f7mekx,1583650353.0,"Of course! It helped my relationship and friendships as well within just two weeks. Now after a solid 9 months, I can only report one intense depressive episode. Still lose my temper here and there, but I’m able to reason through the brief urges to explode thanks to lamictal and of course, mindfulness techniques. I’m so happy to hear that it’s not a placebo effect and that it’s a solid medication for people in this reddit community! Best of wishes to you. You’re doing great."
bipolar2,fjmmere,t3_f7mekx,1583475093.0,"So how have the past two weeks been? Just checking up on you to see if you are liking the new meds. I know changing is hard, so wanted to make sure you were okay."
bipolar2,ficgf7n,t3_f7mekx,1582346374.0,"It’s great! Quetiapine was awful. The adjustment period was way too long. See if the doc can put you on lithium first so you can transition better. If you’ve had lithium before then that shouldn’t be necessary. Make sure you take twice a day. If doc says one full does once a day, just break it in half. It needs to be in your system consistently otherwise you’ll wake up moody or be moody in the late evening time."
bipolar2,fg8f1c8,t3_ex8th8,1580617573.0,"These are almost the exact words and feelings I was sharing with my partner. I’m only 22, but feel like I’ve already lived all my 20s and that I’m never gonna be who I have envisioned my future self to be. But somehow I tell myself that the mundane way of life is better than nothing. You think you wanna go until you get down to the thoughts leading up in to it. All of a sudden your morality kicks in and you’re luck “fuck, I do still care enough about the people’s feelings that are here with me and do care.” You start to reconsider, light a fire under your own ass and it lasts for anywhere from 2 weeks-6 months, and then you’re back to this negativity. What I’ve learned to do is tell myself everyday that this wave of productivity is the new me FOR GOOD. Don’t sit back and anticipate the next time you’re gonna feel depressed/want to die. Be proactive and tell yourself something you love about life every negative thought you get and replace with a positive. Don’t let the negative thought processes continue, use mindfulness techniques (I know, lame), but it really does help. Looking at the mind practically can really help you realize that some things upsetting you are really not even real. I suffer from bipolar mood disorder and BPD so just stop over analyzing and being so hypercritical of yourself is the first thing to do. Then the rest will follow."

popping,f5rzwfy,t3_doubd2,1572407248.0,Why would you not post the whole damn thing? Gtfo of this page. That shit is weak and I feel disrespected.
