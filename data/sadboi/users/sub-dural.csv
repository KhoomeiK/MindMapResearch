My favorite set-ups is my current one and the Sidis with Look.  The double sided pedals are because I do a ton of Urban cyling and sometimes ride to go out somewhere where I definitely don't want to be wearing bike shoes.

In the bike community, there are SO many different opinions about good, better, crappy.  I'm working on a new mountain bike - bought the frame because I didn't like the stock parts.  Instead of getting a stock bike and upgrading it later, I just went for the better class of components.

My road bike has all SRAM red components - they have been running flawlessly for 7 years now.  SRAM red is at the top of the component range for SRAM.  Keep in mind, though, that I've been cycling seriously for about 20 years.  I would go mid-range if  you have the money.  Another thing you can do is upgrade components one at a time.  Cog sets you can cheap out on because that and the chain are the parts you will be changing out at least once a year if you are planning to do some serious miles.

Bike set-ups are infinite these days.  Have fun with it!  You can upgrade any part except for your frame... unless you get a new frame and transplant your components.  Make friends with your LBS mechanics - they are the best resource for everything!"

ankylosingspondylitis,fnxyth1,t3_g4itj3,1587349348.0,"We all know this pain so well.  There’s that gut wrenching knowing this pain isn’t going away any time soon.  You are right on with the heat and hot showers and stuff.  I’m wondering if you can have your PCP or rheum put you on a different NSAID?  They are like many meds - work really well for some people and others not at all.  Naproxen works best for me, but I don’t take it regularly because it wrecks my stomach.  I take it when I am flared up, though.  I take Celebrex daily.. not as strong (for me) as naproxen but it helps and it doesn’t cause terrible stomach issues.  You can also ask for a muscle relaxer from your doctor, those can be helpful.  

When I am in your level of pain I usually stretch, take a hot shower, stretch again, get on the heating pad, stretch again, another hot shower... repeatedly.  I have been taking edibles for years as well for the pain and the lack of sleep because of it.  For some people that doesn’t work at all, but it helps me a ton.  You can look into CBD as well.  I don’t really use it frequently but I’m sure there’s people here who know way more about it / reputable brands.  You can talk to your doctor about steroids, as well.  I’ve never taken them because I have the bipolars and steroids cause some mania in normal people.  It is supposed to work like a bandaid until you can get on biologics.  Definitely not a long term drug, but again some people have to take it longer than others.

You won’t be in this much pain all the time.  I know the pain you have right now, biologics changed my life.  I know you aren’t quite there yet but I’m sure your rheumy will push to start them early on so that you can prevent further damage.   They are another scary concept with AS, but you can cross that bridge when you get there.  I’m holding on mine currently because I work in healthcare at one of the largest hospitals here and we are in a big surge right now (Massachusetts).  It’s very scary, and it should be lasting for the next 3 weeks so I’m hoping I don’t get flared up too much.  My rheumatologist doesn’t want me on them because I am surrounded by Covid.  Going off immunosuppressants can prevent them from working again because your immune system will built antibodies to it.  That was a tangent, but meant to illustrate that I really don’t want to be off my biologic even with the covid surrounding me.  You will feel better.  Sometimes you can have good hours and days even during a flare.  A lot of people here all have good diet suggestions as well.  I don’t do the diet because I am extremely active and need quick energy (carbs).

Another point is that even though this is an autoimmune (over active immune response) your immune system is not working correctly.  Even though you don’t take biologics, you should still make sure you are very careful about covid.

Let me know if you have any questions!  Going off reddit for the night but I will get back to you.  Hang in there!"

None of this answers your question, though.  You just have to get scrappy and experiment with the different routes and find the one you like best!"
ChronicPain,flrz1ro,t3_fq68l5,1585430883.0,"Thanks for the insult.   I’m sorry you are upset that so many people are complaining about the sudden dread thrust upon them and existential threat that is changing the world.  Just because you’ve gotten over your shit doesn’t mean other people aren’t allowed to feel these same feelings.  You call people shallow for disagreeing with you when you have no idea what they have been through or what they are presently dealing with is absurd.  I’m sitting here at the front lines, immunocompromised in a disaster state, but open to listen to everyone complain and listen to their fears.  It’s juvenile to complain that people are complaining because *you* already went through some shit.

You are absolutely entitled to this position.  I’m also not on facebook so I’m not constantly seeing posts about people complaining.  I have instagram but no one on my list posts much about it.  So I am not inundated, so maybe I am just coming from a different place from my own experience.  If you are talking about people complaining about having to be isolated, that’s a different story at the moment.  Maybe This is contributing to our difference of opinion. Be well

**I wanted to edit to add that I am surrounded by medical people who are not complaining.  They are a bit scared, naturally because we have a higher likelihood of contracting it.  But no one is complaining.  Really I guess I’m not used to hearing it.  Thanks for making me reflect on different sides to the same story."

ChronicPain,flqnees,t3_fq68l5,1585400950.0,"Love the irony of complaining about people complaining.

This is a virus that is ripping through the world.  People cannot see their loved ones, they cannot be there with them when they are actively dying of this, the virus doesn’t discriminate.

The people now living through this will likely be affected for the rest of their lives - anxiety disorders and isolation."

Coronavirus,floh2al,t1_flogjky,1585338165.0,"At my hospital we are not quarantining for contact with positive covid patients.  Those healthcare workers cannot work with immunocompromised or other at risk patients for 14 days, must wear a mask for 14 days.. If any symptoms appear they will get tested.  If it's covid than it's a 14 day quarantine, if not, the policy is to wait 3 days after symptoms go away.

She should ask her manager about this, regardless."

That’s what compassion is.  Just answering your question."

worldnews,fl8qmzu,t1_fl8k7tr,1584929914.0,"Hospital policies are changing by the hour here.  There are no longer black and white - it’s either droplet or not or airborne... on and on.  Everyday it’s something new.  Right now we are on N95s for intubation/extubation.  Some are wearing surgical masks over the N95s.  They are changing around policies pertaining to contact with a positive covid patients.  One day we were told to wear x mask, the next day we were told to wear y masks, today we are being policed at work about mask wearing.

Maybe your wife and I work at the same place."
ankylosingspondylitis,fl7zg2b,t3_fn5j6m,1584912668.0,"My rheumatologist asked me to hold for a bit because I’m in a high risk position in a major Covid outbreak, working in a hospital with many patients.

However, after a few days my rib cage started flaring, which as you know will compromise breathing.  

And to be honest, my rheumatologist honestly said ‘I just don’t know’.. These are very foreign and chaotic waters we are crossing.  I ended up doing the injections because either way, I will likely get it.  I will be able to get tested here because the policy is at least 1 major symptom AND be in a high risk class/or healthcare worker.

We are experiencing exponential growth this week and thing will pick up and start getting disaster bad in the next few weeks.

Stay safe everyone!"
AskDocs,fl7nav9,t1_fl7ktvd,1584905294.0,"In my state that has been experiencing exponential growth, they have developed their own testing.  The policy for testing is A to have symptoms and B fall into a high risk category OR be a healthcare worker.

All of these cases are considered presumptive positives because they aren’t able to be verified by the CDC.  We are expecting things to start getting bad in the next 1-2 weeks.

I hope you feel better"
