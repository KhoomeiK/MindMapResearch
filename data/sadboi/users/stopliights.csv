I had a similar 22nd in January, it wasn't even during quarantine but I spent the whole day feeling sad in bed and thinking about how all my efforts for others aren't reciprocated as I think I got about 2 cards. That was a real shitty day so I'm sorry you are going through it too. Theres sadly nothing I can do to make you feel better, but I hope you do soon. 

Do something you enjoy and at least pat yourself on the back for existing through 22 years, I feel ya with your last sentence but seriously well done for surviving. Celebrate your own day of coming into existence"

Truely awful parenting, but probably exasperation at not knowing what to do for her miserable daughter. 

I'm glad your diagnoses are bringing things to light for you, it's sad that parents turn a blind eye to mental issues and ignore them. I always think about how I might be mentally healthier if my mum had just recognised that I was not a normal child and teen, so many extra years to have potentially received help"

CPTSD,fp51hlo,t3_gb37bh,1588313320.0,"My issues dont stem from school but school settings are difficult for me as I am hyper aware of how anxious and fearful I appear and its exhausting trying to fit in, I dropped out of college after 4 weeks and then enrolled for online bachelors degree due to pressure from my mum. It's taken me 3 years so far but I now only have 60 credits left, and I am so glad I am doing it. I even hope to make enough progress with healing mentally to be able to do my masters at a proper brick uni next september (fingers crossed, I still have a ways to go to be prepared mentally for that).

I do want to just make it clear though that (much to my horror) it does sometimes include group work, for me that is through a forum so it's a little less scary than face to face, but it still takes me about 3 hours to psych myself up to click the 'post' button. As much as I dread it, it hasn't been as bad as my brain always tells me it will be. It's been good to be forced out of my comfort zone

Really consider it!! Maybe just enroll on one module and do it part time before committing yourself"

And then it clicked that that is how I let anger manifest. I really thought I was self aware, I really dont know a healthy way to release anger or even let myself feel it

I had to really force myself to do this last week, and it's so difficult with the civil war raging in your head but i somehow managed it and it was worth it just to realise that literally nothing changed, nothing bad happened, no muscle loss, no body changes. Now I'm challenging  myself to be a bit more intuitive with  my exercise, I still definitely feel that 'need' to do it, that isn't going to have gone after just a week, but the guilt has gotten easier and my brain is not all consumed with how many calories I burned or squats I held, like you said you wake up thinking about it, I really suggest taking a break.

I thankfully quit Instagram like 5 years ago due to the effect it was having at the peak of my eating disorder, I'd hate to think how bad it is now during quarantine. Deleting it completely probably isn't what you want to do, but maybe delete it off your phone for just 1 day, and then when you decide to redownload it really critically assess who you follow. If who you follow makes you feel shitty please please please unfollow them, tailor your feed to at least be neutral for you if not positive. I'd really suggest following people like 
bodyposipanda (I also read her book, which helped a lot!) 
jenbretty (and oh my god her YouTube channel!! I cant even begin to tell you how much her videos helped me, they are mainly what I eat in a day type videos, but not the triggering kind!!!!)
thenakediaries 

I can't think of any more at the top of my head but yeah, really just try to limit exposure to triggering content.

I really really suggest at least ATTEMPTING to do intuitive eating and exercising, find positive coping mechanisms as opposed to the coping mechanism of controlling your body's appearance 

I'm struggling with similar issues around feeling obliged to make my body look a certain way and controlling my body and it's so exhausting and  consuming. I'm so sorry you are dealing with it too. Are you in/ever had therapy? Or done any self reflection / self-guided type therapy to try and work out a cause or root of your body issues? 

Do you have a support system? If you dont, I dont either! So I am more than open if you need someone to talk to. If you do have a good support system, please voice your struggles so people can try to help"
