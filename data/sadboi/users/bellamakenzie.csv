I just have to not be a little whiny bitch and get over it. It’s hard when the voices in your head talk shit about you constantly so when any real person says shit it breaks you completely because it’s validation the voices are right. Dealing with body dysmorphia and then having people pick on body parts you’re self conscious about sucks. Trying to hide the fact you hear kids screaming in your head sucks. Being picked fun at for checking on your son 20 times a night Bc of ocd sucks. Constantly being miserable and dragging everyone else down with you sucks. Crying for hours while your step daughters awkwardly pretend they don’t notice sucks. I’m starting an anti psychotic today tho so here’s to hoping.
