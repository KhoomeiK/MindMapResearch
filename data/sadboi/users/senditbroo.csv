dankmemes,fqwntcp,t1_fqwne2z,1589711353.0,"Hmmm I can see your point. But the government can‚Äôt just leave it up the population to stay at home, they need to control it so the healthcare system isn‚Äôt crippled, affecting everyone."
dankmemes,fqwn2q4,t1_fqwmtsu,1589710584.0,"Well where I‚Äôm from in Australia and New Zealand tracking is working amazing. It‚Äôs just the trump administration was retarded and nobody can get tests so that‚Äôs out the window. Supermarkets have only been open, which has worked well because there‚Äôs people in the store to enforce social distancing, and people only shop once a week. This is fine for lockdown."
dankmemes,fqw5j8r,t1_fqw54ec,1589693456.0,"That‚Äôs besides the point. If everyone is forced to stay home,  everyone has less chance of getting the disease. It allows the disease to be contained, tracked and isolated if they‚Äôve only been in close contact with family and been out to the supermarket. It means we can eliminate the virus so no one at risk (whether they‚Äôve been isolating or not) gets the virus. People know the risks but look at the US. 90,000 deaths ?"
dankmemes,fqw4hkp,t1_fqw425b,1589692606.0,"This is so infectious, it‚Äôs not as black and white as that. You can‚Äôt trust people to not get infected. A lockdown is about population wide reduction of movement, it‚Äôs not about individuals. Without lockdown, it‚Äôs a shit show. Look at the UK. They tried no lockdowns. Look what happened."
dankmemes,fqw3jqn,t1_fqw39vo,1589691848.0,"You going out and getting infected and thus infecting others IS harming others ! Big infection chains happen, reaching individuals that are immunocompromised etc. Everyone not going out stops those chains and saves lives."

PiercingAdvice,fq5ag8y,t3_ggr1sz,1589098024.0,"Honestly I‚Äôm no expert at all, and I would confirm it with a piercer, but it looks more like a keloid than a irritation bump."
PiercingAdvice,fq5aaly,t3_ggxcce,1589097867.0,"Also, it‚Äôs extremely tempting to pop it because it looks like a white head pimple with a big head. Obviously I shouldn‚Äôt do that, but i need someone to reconfirm that I shouldn‚Äôt do that üòÇ"

Thank you for everyone‚Äôs suggestions I really appreciate it. The bump has actually gotten smaller in the space of a day, I chose just to use saline spray and hot compress, and it‚Äôs working well."
PiercingAdvice,fpice97,t1_fpgsvjw,1588638029.0,"Thanks for the advice ! No it‚Äôs not possible to contact my piercer, I went to a commercial place for it, they are quite good but they seem to have a lot of piercers coming in and out. They do seem to recommend tea tree oil as they sell saline spray with tree tree oil in it (I no longer use this)"

If I had other girls I knew it wouldn‚Äôt bad as hard, but as I‚Äôm pretty socially isolated at the moment (despite best efforts), it‚Äôs stinging longer than usual. One correction I technically wasn‚Äôt in a relationship with her, we were a thing while she was in relationship. I wish I stood up for myself a little more, cause I was pretty much her side guy."
