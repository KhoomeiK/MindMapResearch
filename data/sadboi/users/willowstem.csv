It was bad, and I had felt more alone than I was in a long, long time. I became resentful, spiteful, and cynical to all of my friends, and realized that it was my own fault for giving too much in the first place. I made a pact with myself that I would no longer fell into this trap again, and I removed my ring from my right hand, and put it on my left. It had been there for so long, feeling it on my other hand felt so much different. I noticed it all the time. It's a constant reminder of the the promise I made to myself and helps me realize when I'm starting to give too much.

One thing that's helped me, is imagining everyone is a salesperson the first time you meet them. You can be friendly, but keep your guard and be prepared to have this person turn on you like a vulture. They have to prove themselves as genuine, not you determine if they're actually genuine.

One thing I've caught on, is when someone is overtly friendly or offering you something that they're making it out like it's a huge benefit to you, and they're doing you a favor just to be friendly as a good samaritan. As soon as you turn them down, they instead push harder like I'm missing out on this great thing that they're going through all the trouble to do for me. Almost consistently, I later find out that the only reason they were pushing it, was because it had a bigger underlying benefit to them compared to the benefit I would receive, but it was impossible at all without my collaboration.
