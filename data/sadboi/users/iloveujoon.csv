WeightLossAdvice,fmj8rol,t3_fvg82e,1586125346.0,I recommend dried beans as theyre fairly cheap and super filling. I know you said you always want meat but try them as a cheaper meat alternative every once in a while or put some of your leftover meat in them. Canned vegetables and pasta are good to get as well. If you have the space you could also grow your own vegetables/produce at a fairly cheap price. You may need to save up a bit to start off but I think it would be worth it in the long run. If you don't have the space then I hope you can find an alternative somehow. Good luck man and you can get through this.

rant,facv01x,t1_facu032,1575947705.0,"I’m really happy for that man and I hope he’s having a wonderful life right now! I just fail to believe that situations like that are the norm though. If someone could get a job so easily why would so many grown adults be working at grocery stores and fast food chains? I’m all for self improvement, in fact even though I’m quite young I evaluate myself quite often and write down things I want to improve upon rather it’s my mindset, attitude, work ethic, or looks. I also find myself to be quite open minded I think you’re judging my character a bit too much off of one post. I got upset because my friend was literally about to fucking kill themself and I got a bit frustrated once the situation ended. I’ll agree, I complain a lot on the internet and I know that no employer or teacher alike finds complaining to be a good trait. That’s why even though I’m almost failing in multiple classes, and I’m mentally crumbling apart I keep it to myself and keep chugging on. There’s no one to blame for my mistakes except for me, and thats why I know i need to continue working with myself to improve. I suppose it didn’t convey well in my original “rant” because I was upset but I just really don’t appreciate when the older generations think our entire lives are perfect and that they “paVED the WaY” when in reality they’ve messed up quite a bit and we’re just living through their mistakes. We’re fighting for social justice while fighting ourselves as well. I appreciate your insight on this as I think all opinions and insight lead to learning but I still have to kindly disagree with what you’re saying. I hope you’ll have a great night."

Many employers won’t even look at you if you don’t have a degree of some sort which do require money (and quite a bit of it in the wonderful united states of america) Also, I never said I wanted to do what my parents are doing. They’re severely in debt and have been to court multiple times over bills that haven’t been paid. I don’t want to turn out like them financially so that’s why I feel the need to go to college so I can receive a high paying job. There’s so much complexity to life and although I do believe self improvement, determination and studying can lead to a person becoming more wise and educated those things don’t count for much on paper. Which I personally think is quite disappointing because jobs should be counted based on merit but that’s sadly not how it seems to be."

AskReddit,eypvfru,t3_cy079n,1567312759.0,Yeah I would love a hug right now. I’m honestly not sure why I’m so sad right now but it just hit me in a wave like 30 minutes ago and it’s not fun. This hasn’t happened in a long time.
actuallesbians,eyeknol,t3_cwq3ft,1567035116.0,"Oh man this is an incredibly difficult situation.

First, I just want to thank you for being a sweet and accepting mother. Thank you for not taking your husbands side side and making your daughter feel even more isolated. We need more mothers like you in the world.

Secondly, my advice to you to help her feel better is just treat her like a normal human being.  Educate yourself on LGBT relationships and rights and make sure that she knows everything that she needs to know and that you’ll be an open source for her if she’s not sure of something. You definitely don’t need to be an expert and you won’t know the answer to all her questions either but as long as you’re putting forth an effort I promise that she’ll greatly appreciate it.

And lastly, I’m only your daughters age so I don’t have a single idea on how to go about this whole thing legally, but if you do get custody of your other daughter things won’t be an easy road between her and your older daughter. Things will be tough, but hopefully with your help she’ll realize that LGBT people are just normal like everyone else.

Also, I forgot to add, but since i’m 15 and also a lesbian Id be more than happy to talk to her and become friends even if it’s only over messages online. Send me a DM if you’d like my social medias! Lgbt kids always need support from others and I’m more than willing to be an extra leg of support for her."

HomeworkHelp,ey6j9pk,t1_ey6j4os,1566856877.0,"It’s 1 and 1/2, one yard is 3 feet and half a yard is 1.5. So yeah, it’s 4.5. I should have clarified, sorry!"
HomeworkHelp,ey6i0q7,t3_cvt27g,1566856069.0,"Okay, I hope I can explain this correctly because it’s been a while since I’ve done this but it’s basically just subtraction!

For the first one, you take the full 180 degrees of the entire angle and then subtract the other given number.

The number you get from subtracting the two should be your final answer.

Your answer should never be bigger than the whole angle and it shouldn’t be a negative either. Good luck!

And for the “solve for x” ones you just set up the variables to equal the angle so combine all your variables and numbers that they give you and then solve for x.

Ex: 4x+2=14"
HomeworkHelp,ey6hbjd,t3_cvtvzr,1566855605.0,"Hey!

To solve questions like these you have to convert your measurements first.

So, 1 1/2 yards is 4.5 feet.

You then take your money amount ($12.23)  and divide it by the amount of feet she bought. (4.5 or 4 1/2)

12.23 divided by 4.5

Your final answer should be 2.72"
AmItheAsshole,exzd8tl,t3_cusnpp,1566664280.0,"Most people are calling you the asshole, but I have to disagree. NTA. Yes, being interested in your partners hobbies is a great thing but if she keeps following whoever she's dating she'll have trouble finding her own individuality. People who follow others mindlessly like that don't really have a personality. 

Also, I forgot to mention it's very compulsive. Like who spends over 2 grand for a gaming setup before they even know if they enjoy it?"
