I completely agree with the vaccine. This will not be over until the vaccine is available to most of the population to develop herd immunity. But wouldn’t it be nice to have the opportunity to lessen the impact while we wait for it?

Why cause more devastation to the world? This would lead to more crime, employment issues and overall grief. 

It’s not a matter of just “waiting it out”. We are in a race with the virus. Letting it “run its course” without implementing any kind of restrictions means letting it come back in surges again and again. The economic impact would be ongoing.

Your theory also implies that letting influenza go would also be the safest option. It too is part of the coronavirus family (apologies if the meta language is not right) so let’s just stop the vaccines every winter and let it rip through communities year after year, right?

basically my point is, we have been given an opportunity to combat the virus with as little repercussions as possible while we wait for a long term solution. Letting it go is not an option for humanity."
