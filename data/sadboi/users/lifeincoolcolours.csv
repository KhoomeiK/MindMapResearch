Men are men, their nature and attitudes towards me won’t change when I get “hot”.

When I reach my bad-ass body I will be proud of myself for all that I’ve accomplished and work hard to maintain it. I will also be enjoying my amazing financial independence and reaping the fruits of a successful career. None of my plans include men.

I am realizing how my life is so much simpler when I am on my own. That’s it. It has nothing to do with “hating men”. Men are fine. I just don’t want to have anything to do with them romantically. Or with anyone, for that matter.

If someone worthy comes along... they are only worthy if I decide that they are. If I choose to not give a man a chance, that’s my own choice and I will take the consequences. I might regret it forever and hate myself for it, which is the outcome people like to think happens often in order to “teach us mean happy single women” a lesson... or I might think it’s the best decision I’ve ever made. It’s not personal. It’s not against this hypothetical guy. It’s for my own well-being. I don’t want to be with anyone EVER. Period. And I’m not going to sacrifice what I want for a hypothetical man who might want me at some point.

But that’s on me to figure out. If he’s as good a guy as people think he could be, then he will also know that respecting and caring for me will have to mean respecting my decisions for my future. There’s no more room for romantic involvements in the life. It is what it is."

I spent my whole life hearing this ever since my teenage years and this expectation that I would “meet the love of my life with a change of attitude” is quite frankly toxic. Because it implies that the attitude is only valuable when and if meeting someone happens.

It’s toxic and negative to make people believe they are entitled to romantic love when really, it’s not something that happens to everyone. But hey, that’s okay! It’s society that has conditioned us to think that love is mandatory - it’s really not!

I have no intentions of not being single moving forward. I want to die a single woman. Granted, I am an ever evolving human being and maybe I’ll change my mind at some point. Or maybe there will be such an amazing man at some point in my life that’ll put into question everything. I can’t predict what will happen. But I definitely will not be expecting it.

selfimprovement,fqx7xfr,t1_fqx7rsl,1589727755.0,About 3 hours later? Damn. Life was fast in “throwing something at you”! Hahaha. I’m happy it did though and I’m happy you’re happy!
sanfrancisco,fqx6jks,t1_fqw64fh,1589726909.0,"Awesome, thank you for figuring this out ❤️"
running,fqx62hm,t1_fqmam8t,1589726618.0,Three weeks. It’s a bummer.
selfimprovement,fqx5ze1,t1_fqx5t6j,1589726563.0,"No, I don’t expect a clap, but I see you’ve made a Reddit career out of purposeless comments so no point in arguing.

Also, you shouldn’t buy cats but adopt them. And yes, I actually might!"
selfimprovement,fqx5uqq,t1_fqx5ip4,1589726482.0,"Ditch the hope, sister! Heartbreak ain’t worth it and you’ll have such a fulfilling life when you do ❤️"
selfimprovement,fqx5g8a,t1_fqx04k7,1589726225.0,Just also wanted to confirm that you are good enough ❤️
selfimprovement,fqx57l5,t1_fqx4kkr,1589726070.0,"I was definitely struggling with neediness and clinginess until I realized that clinging to someone who doesn’t want me and never did is a waste of time and energy 🤷🏼‍♀️ I hope your friend realizes that too someday. I’m sure she will, one day she’ll just have had enough of it like I did.

As for physical affection - two months of quarantine have weirdly enough gotten me to the point where I don’t even crave physical touch anymore. I hope this feeling stays cause it’s quite a relief too!"
selfimprovement,fqx4xb6,t1_fqx4d5k,1589725883.0,Thank you! 😊 and you got this too. You’ll be surprised at how genuinely good it feels.
selfimprovement,fqx4we9,t1_fqx316v,1589725867.0,"What about genuinely wanting to be alone and not have “life throw anyone at me”?

I always found this discourse extremely toxic, to be fairly honest with you. Seems like the only reason anyone should be happy with oneself is in order for “life” to “send someone your way”. Not healthy. Not positive."
