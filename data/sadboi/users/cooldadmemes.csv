Melanoma,fqol08c,t3_gk2i8k,1589517733.0,"*Sorry for the unflattering picture of my quarantine leg.

More info: I first noticed one of these appear a long time ago — probably 8 years or so. It was on the back of my calf. Now I have about 4 or 5 of these little spots and I’m not sure what they are. When they first appear, they feel a bit raised when I run my hand over them, but there’s no pain/burning/itching/etc... they’re only on my lower legs.

I’ve had one pop up fairly recently and finally let my doctor know. I’m hoping to get referred to a dermatologist soon. I haven’t been able to find any similar looking spots online when I search, has anyone seen anything that looks like this? I’m anxious and also beating myself up for not looking into this sooner."

I think about them literally nonstop, starting before my eyes are even open and only stopping while I’m asleep — I don’t know how else to explain it, but it’s like my brain has been waiting for me to even semi wake up so it can remind me of my interest. Sometimes it feels exhausting and not fun anymore because I can’t stop. I’ll stay up all night browsing, researching, etc. about whatever I’m interested in at the time. I also can’t shut up about whatever the subject is and it makes me feel really self conscious, cringey and annoying. I’m glad you posted this, because I have a hard time writing the feeling out but it consumes me. I also get sad when I feel the intensity dwindling, because I desperately want to hold onto whatever the current thing is because I love it so much that I’m afraid to forget about it. When I move on to the next thing, sometimes I lose a lot of passion for the previous one because I’ve exhausted it so much."
