Sooner rather than later as it might not seem serious now but based on my personal experience, leaving thoughts and feelings like this to fester and grow is not in any way helpful and won't help you in the long run. It may be a good idea to make a note of the thoughts and feelings you described and take that note with you to a GP so you don't forget to mention anything.  As for the suicidal thoughts, I'm in no way a professional but - are you feeling like you don't want to permanently die, you just want life to stop temporarily, or to disappear temporarily so you don't have to deal with the thoughts and feeling? The GP can refer you to a professional who you could meet with on a regular basis to talk to honestly, without judgment, they will just listen and let you talk, as much or as little as you want, at your own pace. If that doesn't sound right for you, I hope you at least just speak to a GP about this and don't keep it to yourself. There is someone out there who is going to listen to you. Again I'm no professional but I hope this bit of advice helps in any way."
depression,fk9blpz,t3_fgz1kp,1583972730.0,"Definitely. People don't ask because they genuinely care how you are or want to know if you're not okay. It's just a ""small talk"" question people always ask but don't actually want an honest answer to. I especially hate talking to my boss, who is aware of my depression, because this is the first thing they say every single time we talk and I fucking hate it. Still fucking depressed Carol  thanks for asking, what about you?"

depression,fk98w7f,t3_fh278o,1583971126.0,"having depression that's only continued to get severely worse , even with professional intervention and meds, l feel like I've finally ""woken up"" to the real world and I know that I am going to end my life, if not now then it will be in the immediate future. I haven't decided on how or when I just know that I am going to do it and it has also given me a sense of control over my life and a reassurance which I can't remember the last time I felt.  I'm just so done with life and have no desire to live on. People keep trying to remind me of what I've got to live for, why I shouldn't kill myself. Honestly, all I ever think about is why do people want to live? I feel like society's been brainwashed into thinking life is worth living because I just don't understand it."
