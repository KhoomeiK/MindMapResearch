memes,fqq33p4,t3_gk69tc,1589558573.0,"When I was about 17 my abusive pos dad did something that pissed me off (I don't remember what exactly, but I'm pretty sure its something he said to me), I was already on the computer in my room before he stormed his way back to the living room and I heard him typing on his laptop. I knew he was on youtube cause thats all he mostly does online.   
We were ""borrowing"" internet off our neighbor (unsecured network) and the internet was very slow for everyone. My computer's internet ran the fastest since I was closer to the router and downloaded the most (games, movies, music, you name it). I had a movie torrent that was paused because he told me to ""stop downloading shit"" so he could use the internet. However, after what he said/did to me, I turned it back on and closed the utorrent tab (as it could run in the background and if he stormed in, i didn't want him to see the tab and get a beating). Within seconds I hear him screaming and cursing about ""this fkn internet bullshit"" and silently laughed to myself. He stormed back in and yelled ""are you downloading shit?!?!"" and I said no, that I was playing my game and not using the internet at all. I also told him its probably the neighbor using their internet and that's why its slow, I even tried loading a webpage to ""prove it"" and to show I had no downloading tabs open. Since he knows next to nothing on computers, he bought it and stormed back into the living room.   
I know its mean and petty but fuck did it feel good."

Instead my uncle (his brother) is now wanting to teach me. But with this pandemic it doesn't seem to be likely. Plus I'm used to people bailing on me so I'm not exactly excited or hopeful for that.

People would post and say shit about me and I would hear about it in school. No one could do anything cause I didn't have social media so I had no evidence (I tried having some friends look into it and they didn't find anything so I'm guessing these were semi private posts or private messages amongst them). It got to the point that even kids in other schools knew about the rumors about me. He said that it's not real bullying, that he experienced real bullying (he's gen x) and that I need to get over it.

raisedbynarcissists,fph4nbv,t1_fpfx9ec,1588614892.0,"My story is rather weird. I got a bike at 6 and my dad snapped pictures of my reaction and such. I was only allowed to ride that bike with training wheels inside the apartment. Except that 1 and only time my dad took me to a parking lot somewhere. I saw some other kids and wanted to ride with them and went down a hill despite him telling me not to and he never took me out to ride the bike again. I outgrew the bike and it sat in my room for years and my dad would promise to get me a new bike once I stopped growing cause ""they can't afford to replace a bike after a few years"" but he never did. I used to borrow some of my friends too small for me bikes when they wanted to ride. My dad would be there to help me and since I couldn't ride, my friends couldn't go far and they were clearly frustrated with me. I didn't learn till I was 14 and since I was only allowed to ride for 2 weeks that 1 summer, I lost it by now. I'm 25 and I'm still too embarrassed to even pull out my bike and try to ride it outside. I get too many looks and every failure just discourages me to the point of giving up and never trying again because ""it's too late now"". I think the reason my parents prevented me from learning was to prevent me from having some kind of independence or to be able to ride beyond the end of the street alone with the other kids."

So I did what I was supposed to do and didn't quit cold turkey. Also as someone who is far from ready from having kids, I rather die than give up my sex drive. I lost my sex drive on these things while I was on birth control. It made my depression worse cause I felt like a failure to my partner. Try crying in bed next to someone you love because sex feels numb for you just like every positive emotion you should be feeling.

Oh, and withdrawal even when you wean yourself off is a bitch. Those drugs are basically a highly acceptable drug addiction."

When I asked him why he never even bothered to read the articles or take a PHD therapist's advice, he said it wasn't his job nor what his definition of love is. Oh, and that what I sent him and what the therapist said was BS. He backed that up by saying that his friend who's an ""old school"" (like no compassion therapy or some shit) therapist said it's bs. Plus he tried claiming he knows more about trauma and life than me because he's 16 years older than me. Meanwhile I've been pulling all the leg work trying to get better (currently in private DBT therapy and on a waiting list for free public sector therapy) and if I get suicidal or pissed off over small things , then he calls me mentally ill and tells me to get back on anti depressants knowing full well they didn't help with my anger or desire to end my life and that I even tried to kill myself with them.

She didn't outright say it, she just said in an angry tone ""I know what I would do if my kid did that!"". When asked to clarify, she said she couldn't say it cause it's against the law (that last detail was added later when I knew child abuse was illegal). For years my dad would bring this up to say that even a therapist he saw said I was the problem and him beating me is what I deserved. A few months ago my dad told me the ""truth""  Apparently, he didn't want to beat me and was shocked the therapist suggested that. Which was ""one"" of the reasons he decided with my mom to stop therapy altogether.

Part of the reason I bought the chest is because he kept stealing my weed when I went to sleep at night. He even tried to guilt trip me by saying ""thanks for trusting me"" when I bought the chest. I knew right then and there I deserve so much better."
insaneparents,fk1n54d,t1_fjzr82e,1583783015.0,"My mom opened my mail when I was 17-18 and I lost my shit at her and told her that was illegal. My dad stepped in and guilt-tripped me by saying I should be grateful I have such a caring mother, that she only wanted what's best for me, had no bad intentions and that I should trust her. He also forced me to apologize to her for yelling at her. I reluctantly did and told her don't you ever open my mail again without permission (she actually listened). It was from the blood bank I believe, nothing important, just them telling me there was a collection drive going on in my area."
insaneparents,fk1k2o3,t1_fjz6zep,1583781261.0,I'm guessing they had glasses and their parents are the types of people who think glasses = ugly/not sexy. Guess they never figured that some people find glasses sexy.

Wellthatsucks,fk10enr,t3_fft36c,1583769964.0,"When I was in high school, one of my teachers told the class she and other teachers tried to get them to open the school later. She has a special needs kid and the other teachers fighting for this also have kids. The school had a vote and they lost because my school was mostly full of young teachers without ten-year who don't have kids and wanted to leave at 2:30pm."
narcissisticparents,fk0jxiv,t1_fjzvojl,1583759091.0,"wow, even sir? my ndad wanted me to reply with ""yes father?"". I couldn't even say ""what is it dad?"" cause it had the word what in it."
narcissisticparents,fk0jroh,t1_fjzy9iw,1583758960.0,"Same, my dad said it was rude and would lecture me about it while I exasperatingly said ""yes dad"" and ""no dad"". Then he'd slap or beat me for giving him attitude. When my ex would come over and would say what when my dad called his name, he'd still get offended but would calmly tell him it's rude and to not say that."
Hair,fjxptva,t1_fjxgsya,1583680449.0,Did you have to bleach her hair before adding the color? Or is her hair light enough for it?
Petioles,fjoquw3,t1_fjoqkz1,1583533060.0,"Yes you can! What I find helps (maybe it's cause I'm lazy lol) is putting your weed in a locked box. Either a timed lock box or a key box. For me at least, having to get up, get my key, open the box, grind and roll my weed seems like too much effort lol. Whereas if my weed is right in front of me it motivates me to smoke. Does that make sense or am I just weird?"
Petioles,fjo9zgl,t3_fegcpg,1583523559.0,Same here! Clean since new years! Just found out today that my now ex boyfriend broke into my fireproof chest and stole all my weed.
