It seems to be that because of the lack of resources a lot of trans girls resort to methods of desperation that wouldn't normally be okay. I don't think that this in any way makes you a bad person. In fact it makes you a good person for being there for your spouse in a hard time. Please don't think bad on trans girls because of your partners bad behavior.
