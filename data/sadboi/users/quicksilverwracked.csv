JUSTNOMIL,fph243s,t3_gd1bjl,1588613613.0,"I'll give you some perspective from the point of view of someone who has gone through this as a child. My gran is an awful person, she always wanted a girl and didn't want more than one child, she got a boy, who she beat and emotionally destroyed. When he had kids (me and my sibs) the first two were boys so no good, then I was born, a girl, finally!!! (Jokes on her, two of us are trans lol.)

I was a favourite. It was obvious everyone knew. As we grew up my middle brother was diagnosed with adhd and dyslexia, this was seen as unacceptable by my gran. To her he was just stupid and worthless, she treated him as such. I was above average as a kid so was praised. This dynamic broke both of us. I love my brother, he loves me, but he resented me for the praise I got and I felt deep guilt that he was shunned like it was my fault.

I just want you to know that if this continues as your kids are older and understand what their grandmother is saying that it can be a big problem. Maybe your kids won't care, but me and my brother were sensitive, bullied kids and it was just another knock on the head we didn't need.

I'm sorry you're going through this. It's awful who compares how entertaining a baby is!"
AreTheStraightsOK,fph0lkt,t3_gd85lh,1588612852.0,Ok but this is super fucking weird. I worry for the child growing up if the father keeps up this when the child starts to understand what he is saying. Like that could mess him up and if he is gay make him hate himself as well as damaging his relationship to his dad.
