mentalhealth,f5s3s8l,t3_dp1vyc,1572410815.0,"I will share a true story with you. True and cruel. I got a cousin which I was very close to and her parents trust me a lot. We are both single child and thats why we are closer than most of the cousins. 

She got her condition year before. A bit paranoid and totally incomposed. I tried to talk to her and help her as much as I could. We were both studying abroad and living without families in company. Bit by bit, my patience began to lost its way. After trying every approach I could think of, I contacted her landlord and her roomie. It was after like 2 or 3 months after her breakdown. I guess it was an invasion to her privacy but that wasnt my first concern at the moment. After all I was only hoping to help. In the end I still didnt help her in the way expected. 

After half a year from that incident, my condition came up. I finally experienced the similar feeling of her. Helpless, confused, dont know how to live. Things happened to me in the same order. And I am still recovering. 

What I am trying to say is, people are doing the same thing you would do under the same situation. Its not like they are acting like tyrant and want to dominate you, but only trying to help with their calibration. Stay positive. Open up yourself to them so they could undersrand. I know its hard, I do know. I even attempted suicide 50 days ago. But my fren, now I only want to live my life in anyway I could. Stay positive. Everything will go thats what im telling myself evertday. Lets work together."

I was relying on my smartness to pass exams and stay among the top grades but at the same time I was hanging around the coolest kids in school, the young gangsters. I looked down upon myself and I thought I would die young. But things change when you grew up. 

When you dont know what to do, try to read books. It help a lot. You dont care about anything, so do something noone around you would do. Everybody do piano and soccer why dont you play some pingpong or martial art? The difference would get you interested in a certain way. When you feel you are not interested, deep inside there might be a slight bit of you want it somehow. Trust me, you dont know yourself well. No one does. I was desperate as fuck when I was young.

But only after that moment I wake up and found me alive, I believe there is a thing called destiny and I found out how careless I was for trying to kill myself. It has been for 5 or 6 weeks and I never had any childish thoughts anymore. Not for once. Try to think about something else. Write your story here where noone knows who you are also helps.

Im a sociopath but I still maintain the necessary connections. What I am trying to say is start to care and learn to care. I got backlash from this not-caring character very hard.

I want to work my way out but its hard. We all know it will be hard. What I suggest you is write down your thoughts and try acceptable approaches for you to a normal life. First we accept it, next we try to shift it bit by bit. Thats my conclusion after thinking about it for month+. Anytime you found a glimpse of light, grasp it and write down and look at it from now and then.

Censorship is bs, and everybody knew that. But radical approaches could only lead you to the other side, you are doing what the central government needs now. Even the western media who got their own concerns are not supporting you as they were months ago.

The life you are living, the freedom you are having right now is something other Chinese never experienced. I dont believe things should reach to such extreme levels on the first place.
I can totally understand that your opportunities of employment have been squeezed by the incoming mainlanders cause thats happening everywhere in the world, and also most ppl dont like the Chinese approach when it comes to politics and civil rights, but does these things deserve bloods and tears? I mean, for Chinese, we never value freedom that much, good livings have always been the primary concern, admit it. Besides, Singapore has proven that controling government and good livings of citizens can be compatible. I believe an open dialogue is a good start to solve all the frustrations.
Besides the things you are doing right now is doing no good for Hong Kong, hatred could only lead to hatred. Economic or politic wise this has already damaged Hong Kong as a whole. I have always belived that Hong Kong should be ruled by the its own people. Whether its independence, democracy or what, if it comes from a public voting, people from all over the world will support you. But violence should be stopped asap.

Can you imagine sylar joined aster for a transfer fee at more than half a million dollars? Besides, for more notable players the price is actually more than you could imagine. Players cant build their own team in the way they want, and thats why players like sccc, monet, faithbian struggled for the past season. 
It is true that Chinese players got more salaries than most of the countries, but the system is killing it.

DotA2,esfftsh,t1_esf9zpt,1561925054.0,Thats what VG do. I followed them for two years and they have difficulty to secure their advantage.
DotA2,escrhd9,t1_escmemb,1561836959.0,Two of the last played server by eesama. Classic jacky mao
DotA2,esbgkpy,t1_esb4tr3,1561791107.0,We are talking about two months time into the biggest tournament of esports history. Not likely that would bother either side of them.
DotA2,es9e0j2,t3_c6i2ra,1561734025.0,They should.have approach matu for their pos 1. They would have been a major power if they got matu and abed.
DotA2,es1hesr,t1_es17mk2,1561496870.0,Did you ever read my post?
DotA2,es16oyx,t1_es162us,1561490300.0,So they started work before negotiating with the doldo team? Hmmm i see both ends got a plan b on their side.
DotA2,es14h5e,t3_c5ccco,1561488997.0,They are hiding now. They come from the darkside and they will stay in the darkside.
DotA2,erzo1xu,t3_c51w9g,1561443159.0,"I know it has been said for quite some time, but they really should put up an option for whether a player would prefer to be coached or not. We are here to provide advices not to beg them to take our advices."
DotA2,erz07rb,t1_eryotqr,1561422203.0,What about P E E N O I S E?
DotA2,eryme5n,t1_erydp2q,1561411908.0,Why they didnt do it for p words? Playing in sea you could see that word a lot.
DotA2,erqtwzc,t3_c3fksd,1561151963.0,If they could balance techies mines out they will sure do somwthing about venom after that.
DotA2,erol57g,t1_ernts4w,1561081878.0,Dk bout the specifics but i can run the game with medium visual on 120 fps and high visual with 90 before bp came out.
DotA2,ernqqj3,t3_c3090b,1561058912.0,It doesnt matter. They are looking for a game to compensate their HUGE LOSS on artifact. All effort has been put on that shit and so long as there are still ppl asking for keys here it will remain this way. MONEY FIRST ALWAYS
DotA2,ernmy9m,t3_c2zmtj,1561056339.0,"Its a ruin for 3, joy for 5."
DotA2,ernmry8,t3_c2xg90,1561056221.0,They are busy updating the underlord. Besides morokai wont give any burst to the bp purchase so its likely to be quite late.
DotA2,erl550a,t3_c2mjjf,1560978526.0,Just play a game of 1v1 mid or wait for a while. You see his name removed from post game lobby you can start queue alr.
DotA2,erkftx3,t3_c2i0dc,1560962525.0,He sure will ger banned. Dont worry. Its just some random game you have to go thru.
DotA2,erkehxd,t3_c2gkp0,1560961682.0,Thanks reddit this new racist term just made my day.
DotA2,eriira1,t1_eri90db,1560898686.0,Well with a much smaller chess pool and almost 60% simplified skill effects i cant see any advantage other than faster queuing times and lower hardware requirements. I am damn sure im not in the minority. Most of my frens feel the same as me.
DotA2,erihv1x,t1_eria0ke,1560898046.0,By way eadier control you mean you have 0 hint on how the hotkey works and theres nowhere to click in the ui right?
DotA2,erfme3j,t1_erfc9qg,1560812035.0,"Never thought of it in that way. Guess valve is a political party then. 
Get a life son."
