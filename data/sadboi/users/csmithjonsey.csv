unpopularopinion,fnlje21,t3_g2e90j,1587054561.0,"There are many sides to this. Having a character exist normally with all other individuals and also just happen to be gay is normal. If the writer wrote the show from the beginning to have a LGBT character, then that is 100% fine. This is NOT forcing an agenda (of which I don't believe in). As a gay man, I absolutely HATE seeing forced LGBT characters, and I promise I am not the minority on this one. It feels so wrong and very unnatural. Grey's Anatomy is a large culprit of this, and many mainstream shows that have existed for many seasons seem to be forcing this trope. However, if a show like Grey's Anatomy casually has a gay character that we know is gay by them saying ""I need to check in on my girl/boyfriend"" and is very casual, it is NOT forced - that is natural. Many people seem to believe that simply introducing the sexuality of a character is forced, but it isn't... That's normal. The largest trope that I see with Gay people in shows is when they DO introduce their sexuality, and the protagonists and the supporting characters all look around at each other in bewilderment and go ""Oh...well.....that's really cool!"" (looking at you Grey's). This trope is larger than LGBT people saying ""I'm gay"". We need to also keep in mind that heterosexual couples are the standard in everything, and just by introducing a gay character isn't ""pushing an agenda"", its introducing a different couple narrative that we should all enjoy. No one should be offended by having a gay character or 2 (except if you are a biblethumper and refuse to actually love people like we are called to do). 

Heterosexuals ***can*** force their sexuality by belittling LGBT people. By stating ""all LGBT castings are forced"" you are saying that you want to increase hetero casting because you see too much of LGBT couples. Therefore, you only want to see hetero couples, which leaves us LGBT people with nothing to sympathize with. This is an extreme example, but one that exists daily nonetheless. Heterosexuals squander LGBT abilities through discrimination of ALL sorts, and that is more forceful than an LGBT character saying ""I'm gay"".

To the comments saying that we LGBT people comprise of an extremely small percentage of the population (someone said 1%), please think again. There are so many forms of different sexualities. If you look at the southern population and attempt to state that there aren't many gay people, please keep in mind that we are treated horribly down here and most (if not all) of us attempt to hide it because we live in fear (depending on where you live). I personally know adults that have divorced their wives after 'legalizing' gay marriage because the burden of existing was lifted from their shoulders. These statistics get thrown around so casually and seem to never come from one source. The numbers are SIGNIFICANTLY higher than 1-5%, but absolutely not more than 25%. 

I do not mean to harm anyone by posting this. There are extremes on both sides, but forcing agenda is not one that LGBT people decide, that is up to the writers who are mostly heterosexual."

Anxiety,fbbsway,t3_echhdk,1576707399.0,"First off, you need to know that you're not alone. I have been suffering from clinical anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I would do the exact same thing that you did in high school. I hated people watching me, and I was nauseous all the time. I had chronic stomach pain for as long as I can remember due to anxiety and adrenaline and just constantly flying through my body. 

The issue that I see here is that legally you are a child, and that's making it damn near impossible to find a practitioner to meet your very specific needs. In some books, people would consider this abuse, and in others, they would consider it a child being naive. If you absolutely truly feel like seeing a practitioner would be best for you, then try reaching out to advocacy groups or nonprofits for help. 

Child advocacy networks are great in finding resources for children who need the help, but have parents that are unwilling to help them. Reaching out to a trusted family member or teacher or professor or counselor would be absolutely beneficial. I know it seems like no one is there to help you, but believe me, I have been there before. Find someone that is willing to actually listen, and place your trust in them. 

Find the right person that will listen, calm yourself, look to a brighter future because it WILL come. Look forward to a stronger you. The pain and strife that you feel now will only fuel your change for a brighter future. Tell yourself that you can change it all, and don't be afraid to speak up or do what is best for you. Life is on the horizon my friend, run out and live with it.

My DMs are open if you need anything, I'm here to help.

I find that rock climbing makes me happy - I love the sport, the people, the drive of getting better. It makes me happy. I have completed my goal of happiness. Happiness itself is intangible, yet manifests itself in forms that we can reach. 

Happiness itself is just dopamine and serotonin activating neuronal transactions within the nucleus accumbens. This creates a pattern of learning through our actions with our environment, thus ""rewarding"" us for taking actions that we seem to make us happy. We create goals that BRING us happiness because we have had previous experience with the instance the led us to be happy. It's a feedback loop that translates into us wanting to achieve happiness due to positive interactions and thoughts.

Justifying suffering in ones life assumes that they are 'suffering'. Of course, I suffer from menial, ""first world"", things, but I correct them because I have to. I don't pay my necessary bills to be happy, but because I have to. 

I have found that climbing creates a feedback loop for me in which I have created goals to climb better, faster, harder, and attempting to climb routes that are harder than what I can do. I push myself to achieve these goals, and I feel happy about it.

I see your point, and I respect what you say - I simply believe that people should embrace happiness everywhere and find rewarding behavior to be positive."

I don't mean that in a bad way, but when people walk around, they are thinking the exact same thing, trust me. The thing you need to work on, is small. Stand outside if walking around people is too much. Sir on a bench, watch people walk by. Then, move to larger things. It's a process, and it won't be done overnight. 

I was in the same position, much more so that I secluded myself for 2 months in my room, didn't leave, and ate minimally nothing. I lost so much weight unhealthily, and was mentally and socially isolated. It was the worst. I decided to change something about myself and I said 'fuck this' and started small. I sat on my front balcony and watched people. I moved on to being outside as they walked by. I gave them the occasional 'hello' and they responded positively. It took time, but I graduated to finally being able to walk around crowds and I started complimenting people whenever I felt like it. People were always nice.
