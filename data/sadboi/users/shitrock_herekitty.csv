PandemicPreps,fqqbp5h,t3_gk8131,1589562761.0,"I have RA, lupus, and a bunch of other autoimmune stuff, so even before the pandemic I tried to limit my grocery shopping to once a week or less because I usually don’t have the energy to do so more often. So this is what I’ve learned to cut down on food waste.

So for strawberries and blueberries, I do an initial rinse then I go through them and pick out any that look like they’re super over ripe (usually just snack on those right then tbh), then wash them in a citric acid/water solution, rinse, then dry them in my salad spinner, then store in an airtight container in the fridge. This usually gets me 1-2 weeks. I do a similar process for grapes but get closer to three or four weeks on those. 

As for vegetables, I usually just throw my bell peppers and carrots in a crisper drawer and I’ve had them last a couple weeks. Cabbage can last quite a while too. One I got from my CSA lasted a month and a half in my fridge one time when I forgot about it in there."

So when our Governor updated the stay at home order, she did it in a way that those huge stores had to shut down areas that were selling non-essential items. So Walmart and Meijer had to close their garden and lawn section and Home Depot had to close their paint sections. I believe it’s any store over 50,000 square feet that these restrictions apply to.

JustNoTruth,fljdlxg,t3_fp6639,1585208053.0,"I want to point out something that stuck out like a sore thumb to me. C-diff isn’t food poisoning. It’s a bacteria and a C-diff infection is a disruption of the bacteria in your gut. It usually affects older people after antibiotic use or people with weakened immune systems who are hospitalized or in long term care facilities. You can get it after eating food if you’re hands have been contaminated or the person making the food didn’t wash their hands and had spores left by Clostridium difficile bacteria on them. It’s spread through fecal matter. So washing hands is super important. But it’s still super prevalent in hospitals, and it’s super hard to treat. But it doesn’t “take at least four years to get rid of.” It varies for each person and it can reoccur but OP’s description sounds like hyperbole.

I had to learn about it quick in fall of 2018 because my doctor was pretty sure I had it. I’m on immunosuppressants and I had been staying by my grandpa’s side while he was hospitalized for his esophageal cancer. I started having terrible abdominal pain and horrible nonstop pure watery diarrhea for like three weeks. I ended up in the ER dehydrated. I followed up with my doctor and my doctor’s first thought was c-diff infection because of my weakened immune system and because of the amount of time I was in the hospital with my grandpa. Thankfully I ended up testing negative for c-diff and every other thing she could think to test me for. We never did figure out what made me so sick."

And CDC guidelines say when masks run out, health care workers can use reusable cloth masks (which they do not consider PPE) but they should use a face shield with it. So hospitals around me are asking people to make masks, because we’re running out.

So that’s what people are doing. My local hospital got enough people to volunteer to sew for them. And now they’re holding a donation drive to get real PPE dropped off too. For people who may have old N95 masks laying around or spare hand sanitizer, that kind of stuff. I cannot believe the shape things are in.

badwomensanatomy,fj2xbhf,t1_fj2vn04,1582957427.0,"I know! The whole ordeal was suuuuuuper traumatic for me. I ignored the blood for a couple months because it was only a little bit and it was winter and I assumed I was just dry and maybe it was just eczema. Plus I was dealing with caring for my grandpa who was battling esophageal cancer at the time. But then it started becoming more and I noticed my nipple was slightly itchy and tender to the touch and I had a yearly physical with my general practitioner, so I casually mentioned it to her. She was like “blood is coming out of your nipple??? That shouldn’t be happening at all. I’ll be honest, based on the symptoms you’ve told me it could be cancer.” So of course I freaked out because my family is already dealing with my grandpa’s late stage 3 esophageal cancer and I have a bunch of autoimmune diseases. So my general practitioner decides to refer to a “wonderful” breast clinic ran by the local university (who had recently made headlines over a national sex abuse scandal) and so I wait to get my appointment there. 

I get a letter in the mail with my date as late January for my appointment and think okay this will work. It just happens that we get a nasty winter storm that includes wind chills that make it so the ice melt doesn’t work on the roads, so many roads are closed in the area. My appointment is canceled without them telling me. I proceed to try and reach their office for a month after that and I cannot get ahold of anyone, it reroutes to the wrong department and nobody knows how to contact the breast clinic. I contact my doctors office. They resend my referral. I wait two weeks and still nothing. I contact my doctors office again. They finally hunt someone down. I get an appointment on March 30th. The woman I see is short with me, talks over me and, squeezes my nipple until I cry even though I told her it doesn’t bleed upon expression, it only bleeds spontaneously. Then proceeds to tell me that she doesn’t see anything abnormal with my breast and it’s totally normal to have the bloody discharge that I was having and that many women do. I left feeling violated. A month later I woke up and my bed sheet was saturated in blood from where my nipple had been. I knew that wasn’t normal. Thankfully that day I was seeing my gynecologist. And my gynecologist took me very seriously and she said that she knew of a great breast doctor but it’s take another two months to get in to see him. So on June 21st I was finally able to get proper care. He walked up, took one look and said “has your left nipple always been bigger and more chapped looking than your right?” I said no. He felt my left nipple gently and carefully and sure enough the mass was in my nipple the whole time. Everyone else was thinking milk ducts because that’s what is most common. He took the time to look over my chart and to properly exam me and listen to me. He may have saved me from a future cancer. 

Also, “thankfully” I’m disabled from my autoimmune diseases so I’m on Medicare/Medicaid, so I was able to get the second opinion I needed. I don’t know why people go into the medical profession if they don’t give two shits about people. Like you need to have some compassion when working in the medical field."

It took a few months to get into him but when I did he found the mass in my nipple right away that was causing the bleeding.

JustNoTruth,fiy4m0o,t3_fadl3l,1582832411.0,"When my grandpa was first battling the esophageal cancer, the decided to do chemo by itself. They went with 12 weeks of FOLFOX. He’d go in on a Tuesday, get his port hooked up to machines, nap, and mom and I would go shop at Target for two hours. Then he’d get unhooked from the big machines, and transfers to this little portable case that came home with him for the next 48 hours, it contained his chemo meds. On Wednesdays, he’d have so much life in him. This was a man who had been so beaten down by a cancerous tumor for who knows how long before it was discovered in August of 2018. Then Thursday’s we would return to the clinic where they would remove his portable chemo machine, and we would return home and he would feel wore out and he would sleep the rest of the night. 

On chemo, his hair thinned some but most people couldn’t tell. He also was able to start putting weight back on because his esophageal shrunk to the point that he could eat food again, and was no longer on a j-tube, feeling sick from forced line feedings. He had more energy and seemed more himself than he had in the past months when he had been so sick from the cancer wearing him down. 

He had been diagnosed as late stage 3 esophageal cancer in September 2018, the radiation oncologist told him to tell his loved ones that the cancer had likely spread and that he didn’t have long, and any treatment would likely only be palliative. So imagine the surprise on our family Christmas when we got the results from his PET scan that showed no cancer. He met with his regular oncologist and she told him that it was a miracle. That the chemo had did better than they ever could have dreamed and that at this point his cancer was effectively in remission but that they still wanted to treat his esophagus with radiation to get any cells the PET scan may have missed. He had 6 more chemo treatments, and started radiation in March 2019. By then the neuropathy from the chemo was starting to cause some problems. But he didn’t let that slow him down. He was so damn happy. He had a miracle. He got a second chance at life. 

Until April rolled around and he started having trouble swallowing. So he told the radiation oncologist who was handling his radiation therapy (different from the first one) and he shrugged my grandpa off. Then my grandpa started having pain when trying to swallow, and told his primary who got him to hIs original GI who sent him to a different hospital, who said they couldn’t do a scope because it was too swollen in there from radiation but on a CT a possible mass showed up. So they but a G-tube in my grandpa and called it a day. Never did any follow up on the mass. By June 21st, he was wore out and losing weight again, he ended up down at the original hospital that diagnosed his cancer and they scoped him and told him there was a very small mass in his esophagus and took a biopsy and it came back positive for cancer. They were positive it was treatable. July 9th, the pain got so bad he ended up in an ER, and they did imaging and it looked like the cancer had spread to his spine. We knew by then there was no fight left. The ER gave him enough morphine for three days and apologized because no other doctors would give him any pain medications stronger than ibuprofen, so my grandfather told his home health nurse that he wanted hospice because he couldn’t take the pain anymore. So hospice came on July 12th and gave my grandfather a very peaceful final 15 days. 

All this to say, cancer and it’s treatments are so unpredictable, and really differ patient to patient."

Doors open at the last bell, parents go in to get their kids, older kids come rushing out, total chaos in the hallways. That’s why I didn’t side eye that part of her story because I was like that’s how every school I’ve learned and interned in has been.

Interstitialcystitis,fhrb6xo,t3_f4izce,1581821878.0,"My PSA: I take omeprazole and haven’t found it to affect my IC one way or another. 

If your GERD is bad, I do encourage you to keep it consistently monitored and if there is any sign of Barrett’s esophagus please start a PPI. Barrett’s is the precancerous scaring that comes from GERD. My aunt-by-marriage’s sister got it in her 30’s while on a PPI that wasn’t strong enough and wasn’t working for her, they switched her PPI and have managed the damage. 

My grandfather’s GERD went undiagnosed for years and as a result it went untreated, we just lost him last July to esophageal cancer. It took him in under a year, and ended up being incredibly painful and such a horrible way to go. I don’t say this to scare you but just so you know how serious GERD can be. I didn’t until I lost a loved one to this awful disease. 


Back to the question at hand: Have you seen a gastroenterologist, they may want to do an upper endoscopy? That can tell if it’s a hiatal hernia, if there’s any lesions or ulcers, any signs of Barrett’s. 

GERD is another disease of learning your triggers and timing. I can eat all the Frank’s Red Hot I want to with my GERD, as long as I do it at least 6 hours before bed, but I cannot eat one square of 70% dark chocolate at any time or I’ll be bringing up acid all day. So I’d just suggest starting simple with foods and keeping a food journal. And then if you react, keep track of it, so you can show the doctors. 

I think some common triggers are fatty foods (think deep fried), red meat, dairy, caffeine, and super spicy foods. So maybe start there. Which seems to be some over lap with the spicy and caffeine with IC diet. 

Timing is important, you should aim to to have not have any food or drink within 3 hours of bedtime. Water with bedtime pills is okay. You should also try to sleep with your upper half slightly elevated. They make foam wedges you can get to prop up mattresses for this purpose or use extra pillows. This all comes from my doctor. 

I guess I’m kind of rambling now, but I know your struggle. GERD sucks. I wish you luck it getting the help you need."

Bullshit. If you’re that damaged that your seven month old is making you rage, you seek help. You go get therapy. You talk to your doctor about postpartum depression and psychosis.

The PA at the ER literally said I had a nasty UTI, emphasizing the word nasty, even after I told her that I have interstitial cystitis, a condition that causes inflammation in my bladder. Then I ended up being allergic to the Keflex and breaking out in hives from the neck down. Idk why I can’t catch a break. When I met with my doctor, she told me not to start an antibiotic script from the ER again until it’s cultured. 


I’ll look into the curcumin, I belong to a Facebook group for seizures disorders, and I think I’ve seen some people on there taking that with their seizure medications.

Unfortunately IUDs are a no go for me because I have PCOS with a huge dermoid cyst on my remaining ovary (lost an ovary to a dermoid in 2014) and my gynecologist won’t do IUDs for women with severe PCOS that produce dermoids because IUDs increase the likelihood of cyst production and torsion or something like that. And I can’t do progesterone based shots or patches because they caused me to become suicidal in the past. So I’m stuck with birth control pills. I’m still taking my Yaz pills, but I think I’m on the highest dose already? I have an appointment with my primary Friday, so I am going to be discussing it with her because she is amazing and has been on top of all of this. This is all resulting from a car crash I was in back in September. A woman ran a stop sign in front of me on a high way and I hit her head on, and suffered a traumatic brain injury, leading to seizures. It’s been life changing. I was already disabled from lupus before and now all this stuff. So my doctor has had her work cut out for her. She has me check in with her every 2-3 weeks. So I’ll mention the birth control and how bad my IC has gotten and see if there is anything she can do in the meantime.

I have interstitial cystitis, which increases my urinary frequency, only at that time it wasn’t diagnosed and I had a shitty doctor. Many days, about an hour after lunch I would have to use the bathroom to pee. I would wait until my teacher’s instruction was over and it was time for us to work on our own, then ask for permission to run down to the bathroom and I would always hurry right back. She knew it was my class right after lunch. Finally one day, about four months into our second semester, she was like “I have signed seven hall passes for you this semester and you’re only supposed to have two, so I’m sorry but I’m not going to sign another one for you. You have abused this policy. Go between classes.” I tried to explain that my next classes were on the other side of the school and that I didn’t have enough time to use the bathroom, get to my locker and then get to my classes and I pleaded if she’d just let me go this one last time that I’d try to plan better for the future. She told me no and to take my seat. I had to hold it for another four and a half hours until I got home because none of my other teachers would let me go (and I was very afraid of getting in trouble) and I didn’t have time between classes and I had to catch the bus after school and then walk about a half mile home from my bus stop. By the time I finally went it hurt so bad I was screaming in agony and the next day there was visible blood in my urine. My mom kept from school and took me to my doctor who had early morning walk ins and I tested positive for a uti, so I went on antibiotics and I didn’t get better, eventually ended up very sick in the ER unable to walk and vomiting with a fever."

I believe this is how the drug court in my area drug court works: I believe it is only for first time drug offenders, you agree to go through a certified drug rehabilitation program that the county court partners with and you also get evaluated for any mental health conditions and receive treatment for those as well. That’s done through the community mental health service. However if the problems are bad enough you can be admitted to the hospital for further treatment. You do this for an agreed upon period, depending on a variety of circumstances and in return your drug charges are dropped from your record and you don’t serve any time.

I now take my plaquenil at night with dinner. That way I’m getting it in with a full meal and I’ve had all day to build up my blood sugar stores. I also make sure I get in a small snack before bed if I’m eating many hours before I go to sleep. I make sure to eat properly through out the day, never letting my blood sugar dip. The first couple weeks of plaquenil were a little off, I dealt with a little dizziness and some headaches but then those side effects went away. I also added on Methotrexate and Humira and outside of one day of gastrointestinal discomfort from the methotrexate, I have no side effects from the medications.

I know when my autoimmune diseases were undiagnosed and had went completely out of control my doctor told me that I needed to go on leave from work and she refused to sign off on any paperwork allowing me to return even part time or working from home because my inflammation markers were through the roof and other blood work was all over the place. She said the stress from working would only complicate matters and continue to raise my cortisol and I needed a chance to rest. She didn’t tell me I was going to die though, just that I needed to have a bunch of tests and needed to apply for FMLA and/or short term disability through my job. Maybe OP is in a country where it doesn’t work like that. Maybe doctors are more blunt or dramatic where OP is?

Also, a little pet peeve, I’d like to argue against the OP’s point that nobody has ever died from arthritis. People most definitely die from types of inflammatory arthritis, when it starts to effect organs like the heart, liver, pancreas, and kidneys. She doesn’t say what kind of arthritis her MIL has, and I doubt she even knows based on the mess the post is, but as someone with multiple autoimmune diseases and inflammatory arthritis being one, knowing that my organs could be targeted at any time by own body scares the shit out of me."
