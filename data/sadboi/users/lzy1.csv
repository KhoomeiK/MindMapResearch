When I at first performed searches for conflict between the two MAOIs I could find nothing - because the search engines were only returning conflicts to each drug individually. There was no answer returned for whether they conflict with \*each other.\*

Although I was happy to receive the information you posted, and at first hopeful it might contain a possibility, I did not at first intend to take your advice - for obvious reasons. But you did sound to me to be professional, and perhaps my desperation caused me to be less cautious than I ever previously was.

Then .... and since finding no glaring evidence to the contrary (none affirming either - just none), I decided one day to try it.

The trial was only three days total, during which I felt decidedly unwell and a glimpse of my face in the mirror revealed someone looking sick as a dog, with the worst & deepest purple bruises under my eyes I'd ever seen .. hypertensive spike occurred the 3rd day. - BP 162/102.

It was only then I made a more determined internet search, repeating and scrambling the terms enough times to finally receive several returns from noted medical and pharmacological sources stating the combination of these two drugs is absolutely positively and unquestionably contraindicated - equally if not more dangerously so than the combination with SSRI.

If you discontinue it do it slowly (if you've been on it for some time) - docs are really worried about people abruptly stopping benzodiazepines. There can be some bad effects.

For what it's worth - I'm doing roughly the same. Took me ages to stop taking xanax, stop relying on it. It's only very recently I've finally stopped taking it all together.  The Nardil I'm taking really helped because it has the same xanaxy effect anyway, and so far (it's early days with my titration on Nardil) sleep hasn't been a problem. Some sleeplessness has only just started, as of last night really - on account, I think, of caffeine yesterday to try to jolt myself out of sedated stupor. It was not uncomfortable, restless sleep though, like the kind one gets with stress, worrying. I was relaxed the whole night and just kind of drifting in and out of pleasant thoughts.

(Based on my experience and another user in a forum who quit Parnate because of insomnia, and said the Parnate would not ""cut through"" the Xanax sedation).

It's also true, however, that you may experience more motivation/activation as the Parnate builds up more in your body, despite the temazepam. It kind of depends on where you are in the total cycle. When I was first starting Parnate, I found that after a certain point it did become very motivating. There also some afternoon somnolence that was a bit problematic (like I'd be driving to the store and have to turn around and go home 'cause so sleepy), but it was only in the very beginning, and went away.

For awhile. After a year or two I just started having really low BP type effects - fatigue, lethargy, light-headedness.

So both are potential side effects with Parnate. And seem to depend on how our bodies adjust to the med (or how it affects us) over time. (That's my theory, anyway)."

The thing I do is ride horses - and it had gotten so I didn't feel well enough to do the work involved. I tried really hard to figure out what my body needed, but had to conclude the Parnate had just stopped working. It still helped my mood, as I discovered after I went off it. I felt much better mood-wise when on it, even though physically I was shot. 

So I went off it, because doing the stuff with my horse is important to me, being athletic. It broke my heart that I had to give it up seeing my horse. (The symptoms by that point were pure depression). 

I tried going back on Parnate - no luck. Tried again all the newer meds, but each one caused only anxiety. So as last ditch gave MAOI another try - maybe one that slightly different from Parnate will work. 

So I guess we're saying the Parnate pooped out. I'm still trying to figure out what causes that and whether there's some remedy no one has yet thought of. Very likely the Nardil will follow the same pattern."

I did experience it off and on throughout the course of Parnate. It may have been only when changing doses or changing time of day of dosing.

I'm experiencing it now, as I'm starting Nardil, also. Pretty used to it by now. I keep a heavy sweater nearby to put on. It lasts maybe an hour (haven't timed it precisely), and goes away again if you leave enough time between doses.

And yes, Parnate did work for me. In a big way. I felt like I'd come back from the dead to an all new life. It was gradual though.

>I think I've read (on more than just Gillman's site) that orthostatic drop correlates overall to whether the dose is high enough to have a therapeutic effect in MAOIs and other classes of antidepressants (if not all antidepressants?).

Cool! I mean, it kind of indicates that BP should be affected in fairly a healthy way from MAOIs - i.e., not, at least, elevated. (though not sure orthostatic drop is indicative of lower blood pressure).

So in my case, it's safe to say full positive effect of the medication has not yet been achieved.   


>One month is still well into side effect territory, I think. Much of my side effects did not really start to resolve until month 2, and even then some lingered, and months later as I increased the dose, new ones came up.

This is good to hear. I'm feeling relieved. 💕

I am used to how side effects can come back or new ones come up with changes in dose -I was on MAOI before (Parnate). I've just been afraid that since the Parnate stopped working, and other treatments have failed, that trying another MAOI again might not even start to work. I do think it is beginning to, though.

MAOIs,fguz8ia,t1_fguq1ks,1581132822.0,"So thiazide diuretics (chlorthalidone), the one I'd read of as being the safest - has Severe conflict with tranylcypromine - ""because the effects of hypotensive agents may be markedly potentiated."" (Only moderate conflict with phenelzine, interestingly). 

Cyclobenzaprine (prescription muscle relaxer - safest most frequently prescribed) -  
Severe conflict with MAOIs. High risk of serotonin syndrome, hyperpyretic crisis, seizures, death. 

Hmmm.

My NPLC did once prescribe a thyroid med for me - sort of out of the blue, that is I didn't expect it - to combat the lethargy, fatigue I'd run into with Parnate. Liothyronine. I was dubious but tried it, started getting headaches, and then she had me get TSH levels tested. Turns out I was already hyperthyroid. Caused by Parnate? I knew I was kind of like feeling pressured to be active, that my metabolism was running high - at the same time as feeling tired and difficult to move. Maybe it was a blood pressure thing, I don't know. Most of the side effects as well as effect of MAOIs seem to be about blood pressure.

There was one more prescription I had, for cramps, but it was for lower gastrointestinal cramps and probably not the same use as you need. Dyicyclomine (Bentyl) - for what it's worth, it has only minor interaction with MAOIs. 

The SSRIs, as you said, are the most prescribed for PMDD. If you can find enough research to support it you might be able to wangle a prescription. My doctor (nurse practitioner) pretty much asks me what I want to try at this stage. She knows I'm extremely careful about interactions.

I'm not thrilled with you getting prescriptions from gynecologist though? I'd think they'd know even less about what can safely be combined with MAOI. Do you have a regular all-purpose type physician?

Or else be sure to do the research yourself. Obviously narcotic pain meds are out. Probably all of them are out. But there are other classes - new ones that are prescribed for things like rheumatoid arthritis - maybe don't work the same way as opioids. I've been prescribed several different meds like this in the past - but not when on MAOI. I think I've read they don't really work that way anyhow.

I did have plenty of BP readings before starting Nardil, and have always been on the low side of the healthy range. Actually the last time it was taken I didn't even ask, but assume I'd have been told if it was too high. I have a BP cuff somewhere from when I was on MAOI before - but only used it once, and now can't find it! Hence ordering another.

Yah - the coffee thing. I had been drinking it consistently because before, when on Parnate, I could - plus have been reading several say they need it to counteract the sleepy/drowsy effects.  I only needed a small amount with the Parnate, like a couple sips. But this time have been drinking more - just seems like I need to wake up! So I'll stop with it, anyway. 

The comment about orthostatic drop wasn't from Gillman. I don't particularly trust a site called ""psychotropics,"" and would not trust conclusions drawn by only one man - there needs to be confirmation by at least one other source.
It was from one of the accredited med school (Harvard I think this one was) or well-known hospital (Mayo) or government (nimh) links.

I especially like your comment about when your blood pressure got so low you felt like you could hardly move any muscles. That's how I've been the last 3-4 days! And really stiff muscles. Coffee would possibly exacerbate the BP high & lows by causing an increase and then drop. As probably the Nardil itself is doing.

That particular combination seems concerning to me additionally because both meds can cause migraines. I had a sister-in-law could not take them because they caused migraines for her. Also caused depression for her, I think. They affect hormones, as do antidepressants.

But there must be other ways to treat the PMDS symptoms? Are they mostly pain and discomfort? For water retention there are prescription diuretics (I assume they're OK along with MAOI, but not sure), for pain there must be something that can be used safely along with the Parnate? My doctor said I could take Advil - but maybe that doesn't do it for you.

I do understand the problem. I used to have to miss work at least a day a month, and was on antidepressant. But I didn't have really severe discomfort as I think you have - it was more like a malaise coupled with anxiety."

When I get the BP monitor maybe it will help.

What I've always thought and read in numerous places is for low BP take some salt with water. Salt helps retain water and raise blood pressure.

When there's water retention contributing to high BP, drinking more water helps flush salt and water out to break the retention. There are also prescription diuretics. I was confused for a while thinking caffeine (coffee) could be used as a diuretic (well, it is actually), but it also raises blood pressure so not the best solution."
MAOIs,fgt6i84,t3_f0dtks,1581100066.0,"Just looking at the side effects listed for Yaz I would think, yes, it could cause problems. The two main ones are:

**Taking Yaz can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.** Which is what Parnate does, too - at least the stroke part. I think it means it raises blood pressure, and as such seems like not a good idea to take together.

The good news is that all the symptoms that Yaz reports to treat are the same ones that Parnate treats. 

So here is the side effect that they put in bold on the web site, the only one in bold type besides the first one. It says you should stop taking Yaz and call your doctor if you have:

>**symptoms of depression** \- sleep problems, weakness, tired feeling, mood changes. 

I heard a long time ago that birth control pills can cause depression, so one reason I determined never to use them.

I hope you start to feel better. It seems to me you are taking two meds that are trying to do the same thing - and it may be a good idea to stop the Yaz and give the Parnate a chance to do what it's really good at - without competition or conflict."

Then there's the question of more sodium or less sodium - trying to manage the light-headedness. I've read the basic problem is keeping the water in balance, and this is what makes us feel better or worse. But man, it's not easy - one has to figure out how, and just try all different things.

So I don't think I'll worry about asking for Metformin just yet, but at least I have it to think about if and when the Nardil good effects turn into physical inactivity and craving heavy food.

The urge to overeat continued after I stopped the Parnate, and I believe what was happening then was anxiety eating. So, it's likely it was not caused by the Parnate, so much as the Parnate's effectiveness had worn off. 

The eating then seemed to be from being too anxious to go out and do the things I used to do, but not being able to focus on anything much at all - ending up in something like boredom. Boredom eating. (Boredom makes me anxious, and maybe it's caused by anxiety in the first place).

Also, in the initial phase of taking irreversible MAOI, I found my appetite was suppressed, along with having increased energy. I ate only to keep up my energy, and to have food to take my pill with. 

This changed however, at a certain point, and I began craving carbs and fat - like pecan danish rings, and ice cream. I still kept away from the forbidden foods though - there's plenty of stuff left that's not in the aged or spoiled category. I never missed vinegar, for instance, and was already weaned off cheese - it's constipating anyway. 

If your bingeing is different though, and you think you will not be able to resist the cheese or smoked fish or salomis (full of salty nitrates!), then best to stay away from the irreversibles.

And since your bp baseline is already high, as you mentioned."

Apologies for the “emotional” part. I’m in an up and down phase right now … have been mostly more “up,” but woke up feeling down & it colored that final conclusion – which is not as bad as I usually feel.

I remember Parnate being a bit of a roller coaster too, especially when tapering up or down. (I’m currently starting up with Nardil again).

>Have u tried any augmentation to the maois? Right now I have ideas of switching to marplan or nardil and augmenting it with either nortriptyline or reboxetine and also have modafinil at hand for the most tired days.

I still have modafinil & xanax from past combos - not sure I’ll be able to use them as my system is apparently ultra-senstive right now - but no reason the modafinil augmentation might not work for you. (Though I must urge caution since I've always been more wary of augmenting MAOIs than others seem to be. I guess my very first docs did a good job scaring me with the image of hypertensive crisis).

The nortriptyline and reboxetine may also work. I hadn't considered them and will keep in mind."

MAOIs,fefyzjy,t1_fed8dg2,1579070043.0,"I've been this way, too, about weight gain. The importance of appearance stamped into me as a family value since childhood. And it's very hard to shake, but I did find over the years that remission of depression (caused by combo of medicine and education) seemed to make self-acceptance easier.

I thought I'd just add my experiences with MAOI and weight here:

Both Parnate and Nardil caused initial high energy and weight \*loss\* for me. I took Nardil many years ago and it didn't have weight gain listed as a SE then. When it switched over, I remember it being because I started craving ice cream, and would eat ice cream while reading every night before bed. I went off the Nardil, of course, because of the weight, and didn't have too much trouble losing again and finding effectiveness with something else. (That was then).

More recently tried Parnate, after life events caused worsening of energy and mood, and switching to another antidepressant seemed pretty much impossible because of initial side effects like gastric discomfort or high anxiety. I was told I could try Parnate but it would be the last chance. Which was maybe why I stayed on it long enough for it to work.

When it did start working, it was like I gained a new life entirely - had better energy and motivation than maybe I'd ever had - got to the lowest weight I'd ever been, even as a teenager. Until it wore off, or whatever.  When the ""switch"" happened, I remember having sore/dry throat, and ice cream once again being my main craving. I'm thinking now it was because of thirst/dehydration. Also possibly sodium depletion. (Although ice cream, reading the label, doesn't really have as much sodium as I once thought).

Anyway, this time when I gained weight I didn't have anything to switch to to bring the energy/motivation back (though I'm still trying) .. .  so it's looking like the downside is pretty much erasing the years of upside. Like paying the piper. Although I wouldn't give the experience of those good years up, either. And I still hold those times up as a goal to work toward.

All this is neither to be encouraging or discouraging about using MAOI; just more info for the knowledgebase."

Anyway, I diverge. I hope you can find a more satisfactory experience.

My takeaway from experience with Parnate is thinking I should have dropped the dose as soon as I started feeling better. In hindsight, I can see I was doing a lot of running around in too-hyper mode, not being particularly effective, or smart. Lots of good exercise, but diminished short-term memory; a lot of marching back and forth, forgetting where I was going sort of thing. I could have done with a little less of that.

One man related a nightmare he'd had involving a chainsaw (we'd read an article the day before, in People magazine no less, something about a chainsaw murder) - but the thing is, he was perfectly calm and smiling during the relating, as if he were telling a joke.

I've come to realize that something like that can be experienced in a dream while feeling completely neutral. To feel neutral instead of afraid is an experience to be prized. And now I can imagine taking mirtazapine without fear of ""nightmares."" Because they can be things that might once have been scary, but in the mirtazapine-world, they become more like a comedy.

I also experienced panic attacks in this period. As well as brain fog. One would seem to be caused by the continued hyper-vigilant state initiated by the MAOI, the other to the fatigue one might feel as from adrenaline leaving the body after a scary event.

Eventually (months later) my brain slowed to a pace where there was no more panic, as well as improvement in short-term memory; I could remember words I had previously to fish desperately for when more nerved up by the medication. 

I've come to believe it is the effect on adrenaline that causes a lift out of depression (in the way coffee can be an antidepressant, more mildly).
