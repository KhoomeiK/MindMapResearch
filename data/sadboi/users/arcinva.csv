However, some surveys have shown a disproportionate number of CEOs have it - I've seen numbers anywhere from 12% to 21% cited.  These people literally don't care.  They are incapable of empathy.  So they don't feel bad about destroying one man's life.  To them, it's one man weighed against tens of thousands of employees and billions of dollars.  They also don't feel for their kids in the way a normal person does.

I've always dealt with tight/sore muscles in my shoulders, neck, and shoulder blade area due to my anxiety and low energy from my Dysthymia but then I started getting stiff and sore all over and was so downright *SLEEPY* that my psychiatrist ended up giving Adderall to help so that my anxiety and depression wouldn't worsen even more over worries about my job, etc.  My GP ran tests for Lyme disease, autoimmune diseases, and finally checked my vitamin D level.  My vitamin D was low so I started on a supplement for that but it didn't help.  For about a year, I started taking CBD oil capsules from the health food store (so I mean hemp-derived CBD oil, not medical marijuana derived) which actually *did* help some with the stiffness and soreness.  But then I progressed on to having widespread nerve pain.  My psychiatrist and I also tried some different dosages and different antidepressants to no avail.  I also started taking gabapentin at night to help me sleep because sleep issues started (weirdly a good while AFTER the overwhelming sleepiness had started).  My GP also referred me to a sleep doctor but after a consult, we knew we could rule out sleep apnea so he didn't feel a sleep study was necessary.  It looked like we were on a path to a diagnosis of fibromyalgia when my psychiatrist decided to try Cymbalta because it is an antidepressant that also has an indication for fibromyalgia pain.  I also decided it was time for me to take some time off work, which my psychiatrist thought was an excellent idea.  So he gave me a note for a 6-week leave.  Between that time to decompress and the new medication, I improved like 85%.  Over the past few months, I've noticed that of I go more than a couple of nights with little or poor sleep or let myself get too stressed without remembering to stop and breathe and relax, those pains start coming back some.

You have to talk to your therapist.  But I do understand how hard that is to do, which is what you are describing.  When I shut everyone out and just want to be at home, alone, I say I'm turtling.  LOL."

dysthymia,fdjsk1y,t1_fdjc938,1578485958.0,"My favorite therapist explained it to me this way:  

Imagine your mind as a field of tall grass.  Everyday, you walk across the field.  After the first time you do, you end up following the same path as the day before because the grass has been trampled there, which makes it easier to walk.  You do this for long enough and eventually you have a well-worn and easy to walk pathway.

Then you're told one day that you must take a different path.  It's difficult because the grass is tall and thick.  But, if you choose to follow this new path the next day and the next... Eventually *that* becomes an easy to navigate, well-worn path and the old path will begin to disappear as the grass grows back up.

THAT is your brain's neural pathways.  Your thoughts, over time, literally reshape your brain.  New pathways are formed and, if used regularly, are strengthened over time.  Learning to identify those negative thoughts and choosing to challenge them and change them is you choosing to create a new path through that tall grass.  It is difficult at first, but over time becomes easier until it (hopefully) becomes your default path.  Does that make sense?"
aww,fdj4pvk,t3_elkvc0,1578458385.0,I needed this today.  Thank you for sharing your family with us.
dysthymia,fdj3lut,t1_fdi8zyv,1578457542.0,"I agree with u/ShaneC80.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can be such a huge help in learning to identify and challenge your negative thinking patterns.  It is not a quick process, but if you find a therapist that you click with, it is invaluable.

I'm also not sure if you're aware that we dysthymics can experience what is called a double depression, which is when you have an episode of major depression on top of your dysthymia.  It doesn't sound like you've had issues with that, which is great."

AskHistorians,fdhlxq2,t1_fdh71dc,1578425448.0,"Thank you for adding this German perspective.  I, an American, am feeling embarrassed to say that I was not aware that there were German conquistadors and explorers in South American at this time.  I can't recall hearing anything about Germans aside from the Hessians that were involved during the Revolutionary War.

Is it possible that there were just fewer Germans that came to South America overall so it just seems like fewer survived as opposed to the Iberians?  Or were there survival rates by percentage genuinely that much worse?"
dysthymia,fdh9kpl,t3_elcnzu,1578418331.0,"Glad to hear you are in therapy.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is excellent for helping you to identify and change your dysthymic thoughts.  But it does take time.

You might end up needing medication... or maybe you won't.  But your therapist should be able to help you decide if it's time to talk to a psychiatrist about trying medication.

Since the other poster mentioned vitamin D, I will add in the possibility of a full-spectrum lamp.  Especially if you are from an area that has very short days in the winter and/or if you work a job that keeps you indoors all day.

But being open and honest with your friends can go a long way towards ensuring you keep those friends because they will better understand the times your mood may be different or you don't stay in touch when going through a depression."
