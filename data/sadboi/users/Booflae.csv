mentalhealth,fqzzk0j,t1_fqzz9z2,1589779462.0,"I think it's important to be able to trust your partner.  If you do end up in a relationship, you should be able to share concerns like this. I'm not saying to dump everything at once, but let him know that this is a serious thing for you. It would suck to have to hide anxieties from someone you love."
mentalhealth,fqzz5wx,t3_glux7o,1589779158.0,"It's good that you're still happy with your body for the most part. I'd suggest talking with the guy you're interested in to express your concerns about this, and maybe talking to a therapist to see if there is a good way to help with the body related anxiety. Even if you're not worried about any other mental health related issues, having someone professional to talk to that isn't directly involved would be smart. I hope things go well for you :)"

raisedbynarcissists,f6e7knw,t1_f6c2sd7,1572801039.0,"I would not say the change was ""random"". People's sexual orientation can change due to trauma. Also, sexual orientation can change throughout a person's life. People usually don't know from the beginning that they're gay or bi or whatever it may be. A lot of it is self discovery. So, yeah, a person can think they're asexual because of trauma and realize with time and support that they may want sexual contact at a later point in their life. Other people who have those experiences may be permanently closed off to sex. Also, asexuality is ""the lack of sexual attraction to others, or low or absent interest in or desire for sexual activity."" Just to make sure we're on the same page."
