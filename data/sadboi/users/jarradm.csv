Drugs,fdk3a8v,t3_elmb4g,1578495009.0,"Getting checked isn't going to stop you from getting HIV. Go get on PEP aka post exposure prophelayxis. This is an HIV drug that you will take for a week and is 98-99 percent effective at stopping the transmission of the virus. I am a gay man and never have unprotected sex but still take PREP (pre-exposure) as a precaution. Most city clinics will give you the drug for free if you tell them you had receptive unprotected anal sex with a stranger (don't be scared to disclose to counselor). If you have insurance, tell your GP you need a PEP prescription now. You have a 78 hour window and after that the effectiveness of the course decreases dramatically. Beyond that, try to feel less ashamed, sexuality is malleable and we all experiment, drugs or orherwise. Grindr is a harsh cultural experience tho and some dicks are gross, and anal sex hurrs like a motherfucker to me. DM me if you have any other questions. Good luck."
