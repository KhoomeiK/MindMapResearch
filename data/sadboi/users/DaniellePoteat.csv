ptsd,f0msikg,t1_f0lo9g4,1568752174.0,I can relate. I canâ€™t watch things that depict car accidents. The worst thing is to accidentally stumble across an ad on social media for texting and driving or whatever because thatâ€™s when your guard is down. You never realize what itâ€™s about before itâ€™s too late. They are meant to be disturbing and upsetting so it makes it so much worse.
ptsd,f0j6001,t1_f0j3fqo,1568651653.0,"I agree, a good therapist is key. One that makes you feel heard, validated, and can help you process. Good luck to you on your journey! Itâ€™ll get better."
ptsd,f0j2s4g,t1_f0j1j54,1568650385.0,"I donâ€™t know how old you are or anything but I was like- 15 when my trauma happened. I did trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy and it is the only thing that helped me through that time in my life. I think it is only for people under the age of 18, but I think cognitive behavioral therapy is what they do with adults and it has a similar goal. Might be worth exploring. Hope your bad day gets better."
ptsd,f0j00a3,t3_d51bvy,1568649291.0,"Time will heal you. I can relate to that so much. I used to have similar feelings about who I used to be before my trauma. I missed that girl all the time, I cried and grieved the loss of her for what felt like forever. But you will enjoy life again. It isnâ€™t always a walk in the park and certain things can bring up unpleasant memories/feelings, some days are harder than others, but you WILL enjoy life like that again as long as you are trying. And youâ€™ll love who you are again, even though who you are may be a little different. I hope youâ€™re sorting through those feelings with a professional because itâ€™s hard to recover/process on your own, and sometimes the people around you just canâ€™t understand. Best of luck to you. ðŸ’–"
