EDanonymemes,f6avir4,t3_dqnuo8,1572763177.0,"Ugh this happened to me last week while on the hunt for new pants for work. It’s a pain in the ass to find the specific styles that are in line with uniform rules in the first place, then add in the overall stress and inconsistency involved with clothing sizes and trying things on...a storm’s a-brewin’.

A big problem for me is the feeling that the same damn pair of pants can so easily fit / feel differently on different parts of the body. Like, they’d be comfortable around the legs, a bit snug around the butt, but gap at the waist, usually with a sort of drop-crotch effect. The fact that one pair of pants, regardless of size, can cause all different kinds of triggers and feelings is maddening.

I hate clothes that are not leggings or joggers, oversized shirts, stretchy or loose fit athletic tops, or oversized sweaters. Anything that comes in a numbered size stresses me out immensely."
fitbit,f24c2o7,t3_dbqcd0,1569948799.0,"I mean, I’ve seen a lot of posts and reviews lately that do not speak too kindly of Fitbits, but it seems that most issues discussed are related to the Versa models / smartwatch type. Which are expensive and beyond the realm of what I wanted or could afford. 

That said, I have an Inspire HR. Bought it right when it came out. And I’ve really had no major issues. Yes, I sometimes am given “steps” when I’m driving, and the HR feature doesn’t always do well with strength training, but I am not a weight-lifter. My strength training is usually mixed in with cardio in one workout, so it’s not as big of a deal to me

I do yoga, and I know that’s hard for the tracker to keep up with due to all of the movement involving my wrist and forearm. Then again, worrying about calorie burn accuracy during my yoga practice isn’t exactly what I want to focus on.

I do think these types of issues aren’t necessarily specific to the Fitbit line. Optical HR is always tricky and it has a bit I’ve owned two Garmin devices (which were/are great, but outdated and the HR one I have is kind of uncomfortable), and two Misfit devices. Which looked nice but didn’t do much. 

I can’t speak to the issues others have had with customer service and other models; this is the first and only Fitbit brand tracker I’ve owned.

For the price point, I think it’s great. Gives me all of the info I want in a slim and comfortable form factor. It’s not perfect. No tracker is. And as for the having to pay to see certain metrics, I’ve simply ignored that stuff. I’m not that much of a data junkie.

The Inspire HR is basic. It’s comfortable. It’s waterproof. It’s accurate enough for me. I like the app’s UI and that I can link my food logging app to it so that it’s easier to track calorie intake (last I checked, fitbit’s own database is pretty lacking). And I’m not sure about how long it will last me. But it’s going strong as of now and it’s been worth it to me. It gets me moving and *inspired* to meet my goals. 

I think it’s a nice intro to the fitness tracker world, and a great option for those who don’t necessarily need or want a smart watch. 

Just my experience and $0.02."
Waiters,f21kuxc,t3_db7opu,1569873414.0,"This happened at the last place I worked. The kid was doing carside / to-go and that working area was separated off in its own little room. With a door, obviously. He just wrote, “I quit”, hung it up on the ticket line thing (I to this day have no idea if that has a real name) and at first everyone thought it was a prank. 10, 15 minutes, a search of the building, the parking lot, and the dumpster area later...he had, indeed, walked out."

TL;DR: check out indoor walking workouts (Leslie Sansone or Jessica Smith) and yoga (Yoga With Adriene and the Down Dog app are what I specifically talk about here).

So. If walking is something you can do and it’s your main form of reliable exercise, there are many in-home walking workouts available all over the place. 

There’s the “classic” Leslie Sansone: Walk Away The Pounds (these are the most basic I would say. Leslie can be...um...a little too chipper for me, and there’s a Christian influence on some of her stuff) but if you have a lot of movement limitations, her workouts are a good place to start). She has a subscription service for like $5 a month that lets you access basically all of her workouts and the app includes a calendar-based system. They pick the workout for the day, or you can just use the video library to choose for yourself. Also, you can find many of her videos for free on YouTube and such. Four main moves, can get a little repetitive, but very easy to follow and the closest thing to simply walking. 

Then, my favorite, Jessica Smith. She does walking-based workouts, along with all types of other things (yoga/Pilates/barre “fusion” sort of stuff, some kickboxing, simple stretching, strength training, etc.), and I just think she’s fab as a trainer. She has an enormous library of free workouts on YouTube in addition to many excellent programs / videos available for purchase. What’s GREAT about her is that she’s all about the concept of “challenge yourself, but always take care of yourself, too”. She always provides options for modifications based on your potential limitations, has an excellent focus on good form, and she mixes things up so it doesn’t get boring and you get a more complete workout than you might if you were simply walking. Again, her YouTube selection is VAST, and she provides specific videos for folks that have limitations due to back problems or knee issues or really most anything you could think of. She’s all about making it work for you, whatever your level is or whatever your limitations may be. I love her. 

And finally, as others have mentioned, yoga is fantastic, so long as you listen to your body and respect its abilities and limitations. Yoga with Adriene is always a crowd favorite, and of course her practices are freely available on YouTube. Adrienne is great and an excellent instructor. Personally, I use the Down Dog app; it isn’t free, but I think it’s worth it if you try out yoga and decide it’s something you’d like to do on a regular basis, and the funds are accessible to you. Subscription is about $8 / month. I do believe they now have a free beginners’ course. I’m not sure if it’s a separate app or included in the regular app when you first download it. I love it because everything is customizable and you never get the exact same practice twice, unless you save one and want to do it again. They have “boosts” for things like chest and shoulder opening, low back opening, flexibility, aerobic effect, hip opening, etc. Quite a few options for background music (or none at all, if you like, or if you want to play music through a different app), and you can choose the voice of the instructor from the selection they have. There are four (maybe five?) styles of practices with adjustable length, pace, and level (i.e. beginner I, beginner II, intermediate I, and so on). 

Okay so that sounds like a lot, I know. I don’t mean to overwhelm. It’s just taken me a long time to find what works for me, so I’ve explored a lot of different things.

[Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com) 

Those are the “official” websites; for the first three it’s worth searching them on YouTube, as it may be easier to find what you need more quickly, but I figured I’d link the sites anyway as a potential means of introduction to / exploration of each. Leslie’s site in particular is packed with (her own) ads, but a few clicks around will give you an idea of what you’re looking at, workout-wise."

mentalillness,f0t3sob,t3_d6dwfh,1568915442.0,"TL;DR: Yes. Mental illness can most definitely have a huge impact on how doctors approach us when we come to them with physical ailments. There seem to be no qualms about blaming and shaming those who are suffering into thinking it’s just psychosomatic, or caused by x y z thing that we do ourselves to cope, or dismissing it altogether, as we are often considered unreliable narrators in our own lives. 

Now for story time! Very long read; this post just really got to me, and pardon me for venting. I hope maybe others can relate and know they’re never alone in these struggles.

I got so sick for the entirety of the summer of 2017. This was some sort of GI issue. It remains a mystery to me. 

I could not eat. The nausea was the most intense sensation I’ve ever experienced. And I can’t stand being nauseous. If I tried to eat, it would come back up. I lost about 50 pounds in 3 months. The only thing that could help was cannabis and the very limited supply of zofran that was offered to me.

I go to the GI doctor. First question, “Do you smoke marijuana?”

Uhhh I mean like yeah because it’s the only way I can work and live without spending every minute with my face stuck in a toilet bowl or having to ask my husband to pull over while we’re heading home so I can get out of the car to vomit. (It also is very useful to me in terms of addressing psychological symptoms, but that was kind of beside the point with this guy.)

Doc: Well, that’s why. You think it’s helping you, but it’s what’s causing the problem. 

I tried to stop, even if just to entertain him and rule out the issue (or so I thought). No matter what I did, this dude was convinced it was weed. 

I saw other doctors. I had some tests run. Nothing came back conclusively. So I’ll give them that. But then, I turned 26 and lost my health insurance. This was right before they were supposed to do an abdominal CT. So that never happened.

So, I go to my psychiatrist, who is the only doctor I see now (again, uninsured). 2 seconds into the story, all she has to say is how the nausea and vomiting are all psychosomatic and related to the severe anxiety disorders I deal with, and the weight loss? Well, I have been through an ED, but was in recovery for a long while. Years. I never engaged in the behaviors that whatever this physical problem was leading to (i.e., purging). She suggests it’s all intentional and I need to be placed in an inpatient facility. 

Sooo which is it? Am I exhibiting ED behaviors, or  it’s unintentional and is it all rooted in anxiety? Both? Oh, ok.

It was like every doctor just cast blame on me for the psychological conditions I deal with, how I deal with them on my own (because I wasn’t getting the help I needed elsewhere), and it was all my fault. So they all threw their hands in the air and gave up. Must be the braincrazies, right? 

Apologies for the novel; it’s something I’m still kind of pissed about.

Thanks for letting me share."
Anxiety,ezwy0hy,t3_d2n5nh,1568227661.0,"My psychiatrist told me two days ago, when I was breaking down about work and general life conditions that are exacerbating my anxiety (and all other mental illness-related symptoms), “It doesn’t matter how much medicine you take. You have to have a job. You have no choice. You have to go in, not become emotionally attached or involved, avoid other people that stress you out (I’m a f’n restaurant server, yeah, that’ll work /s), collect your pay, and leave. There is no other way. You just have to keep your emotions out of it.”

She absolutely gutted me. Yes, she has many valid points, but A) This is nothing I don’t already know, B) The speech was completely lacking in compassion and felt like she was telling me to just get over myself and control my emotions, which is definitely not the primary issue I seek to address by staying in some form of treatment worth her (/s), and C) she dismissed any and all consideration of medication adjustment because I can only cope by...just dealing with it, I guess?

She passed me the tissues. She sent my prescriptions. She scheduled my next appointment.

I handed her the fee for the uninsured:  $100. There was nothing more to discuss. I walked out, still crying, and had to take 10 minutes sitting in my car crying before I could drive again.

Yes, there is much more than medicine that is useful and necessary when treating mental illness. Yes, it’s ultimately up to me to decide how I’m going to react to things in general. Yes, I should approach work as simply a means to an end, and not allow it to overcome me.

But I can’t just turn it off. I can’t prevent the anxiety from coming. I can’t prevent the anger, the depression, the mixed states, the rapid cycling, the hypomania from coming. 

So, it is exponentially harder to do all of the above-mentioned things than it would be for a “normie”. 

Yes, we should put effort into learning to help ourselves, but we should also have compassion for ourselves (and I wish from others, but that’s not often the case), knowing that the way we feel is not necessarily our fault. Struggling is valid. Our experiences are valid. We do deserve to be treated with basic human decency, regardless of whether or not we are able to cope with our symptoms at any given time.

This is a tough life. Tough is a massive understatement. But we survive in the faces of the monsters that live in our brains and that takes incredible strength and grit that we almost never tend to give ourselves credit for.

Sorry for the novel. I have a lot of feelings and tend to always write more than I initially intend to lol.

You’re not alone. And you are so, so strong."
