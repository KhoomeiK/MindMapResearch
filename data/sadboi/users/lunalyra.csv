But with me temporarily moving countries and now the pandemic it’s all put on hold. What has been diagnosed though is fibromyalgia, BPD (borderline personality disorder), and depression. 

What’s on the table still is potentially CFS, a deeper neurological problem, potentially a thing called costochondritis which is pretty much confirmed and potentially ADHD. So I’m a barrel of fun for GPs. You can imagine the years of being told I’m just a depressed uni student and I’ll “grow out of it” and well look at me now. Guess there always has been something wrong but nice to finally get somewhere with answers. It’s weird how they all seem to correlate. My doctor believes that my brain might just be wired for pain both mentally and physically and that’s why we’re looking into more neurological stuff. All fun times right here."
AskUK,fprslb3,t3_gf48ft,1588861227.0,"One of the reasons I quit awhile back was because I was chucking £10-20 a week for a a couple packs and that was me buying the cheapest I could get. Went and lived in Spain for a year where a 20pck cost me 4.25€, picked up the habit remarkably quickly but have cut back since returning to the UK. Rollies CAN be cheaper but not always. It depends on how much you smoke and how thick you make them. I know people who smoke more because of rollies because they think they “aren’t as strong” so 1 cigarette ends up being 2-3. Others make them really thick and tightly packed and so they go through a 30g pouch really quick. For me a pack of 20 will last me maybe a week but I’m not smoking as much as I was. A bag of tobacco on the other hand though had lasted me upwards of 3 weeks but I roll very skinny rollies and I’m honestly shit at rolling so it makes me less likely to smoke because it’s a hassle."
TrueOffMyChest,fpjsz08,t3_gdod0b,1588680118.0,"I’m going to go against the grain on this one. Note: I have been ghosted several times before but I have not ghosted someone myself, but that’s down to me only keeping a very small group of people around me. Getting ghosted sucks and it hurts but I think it’s better than some alternatives.

IMO it’s okay to ghost because it gives you a clear understanding that that person is a shit person/friend. IMO that’s much better than the song and dance of you slowly losing touch over the course of weeks or months. Constantly getting patched or ignored only to be given a half-hearted excuse of why they were busy. Like no if you don’t want to talk to me or hang out then don’t do the song and dance just tell me or ghost. People can’t be blunt so ghosting is the next best thing in my opinion. If someone ghosts you then clearly they aren’t someone you want around anyways because they don’t want you around either. Why put energy into someone who can’t give you the decency to put in equal work? You should surround yourself with people who genuinely care and want to be there for you. And I agree it does hurt but in the long run it’s better because you haven’t wasted more energy on a POS person.

So IMO ghosting is great at getting a point across, it’s an ass move when they could just be straight and upfront with you, but to me it’s better than the alternative of me wasting months on a person who clearly can’t be bothered only to eventually lose touch slowly. Just rip the bandage off it’s quicker and you can move on faster to find better people."

AmItheAsshole,fnfgkuq,t3_g1bn71,1586907643.0,"NTA I mean people can name their kids whatever but I think it’s really irresponsible to name your child in a way that will hinder them in real life just so they can be “special” or “different” or whatever else. Like some celebrities’ kids, if you named a working class child one of those they would get picked on galore or just have a hassle in life and school about their name. Be creative 110% but sometimes it’s just overdone. 

I personally adore the name Evangeline but I realise in this day and age probably not the best name because it’s “old timey” like Ruth or Joan if that makes sense. Eva is an adorable nickname but I realise the poor kid would constantly be correcting to go by a nickname. I have a Gaelic name and the majority of my childhood (when I was in the states) was spent correcting people and trying to go by nicknames to make it easier for them and helping with spelling etc. but it was constant. Every single person or teacher or adult would comment on my name in some way, butcher the pronunciation, make fun of it, it’s not even a difficult or uncommon name it’s just spelt differently than the American way so they thought it had to sound “weird”. I’m in the UK now so I don’t have that problem anymore and I truly love my name and now wouldn’t think of changing it but I get where you’re coming from and I think you’re well within your rights as an adult to change your name to whatever you want. You do you it’s your life and your name, yes your parents gave it to you but they don’t have to live with that being their name."

The anxiety of eating got so bad that anything I got down me came right back up again because my body would just reject it. Sickest I’ve ever been and it was dreadful. My mind had convinced my body that food was basically poison so for months nothing would be kept down and it could take upwards of an hour to convince me to eat or calm down enough to try.

But I’ll also tack on that not having kids at all is also not selfish. Children are a big deal, they are tiny humans that rely solely on you and they deserve to have the best start in life you as a parent can give them. The idea that you waiting to be in a stable and optimal position to have children is selfish is ridiculous. I also find however when people tell me I’m being selfish for deciding not to have children is just as ridiculous.

Kids are a massive deal and waiting or not having them at all is not selfish and people need to keep their nose out of other people’s reproductive choices tbh. When someone does or doesn’t procreate does not effect you in any way so leave them alone."
unpopularopinion,fjgbms2,t3_fd02dq,1583320873.0,"My mother quit smoking cold turkey each time she found out she was pregnant with me and my siblings.

They picked up smoking and drinking again after each birth and did so throughout my childhood though but as soon as they found out they were pregnant they’d stop and they were very careful with smoking around us until we were 13/14. 

It’s strange though because they did everything right like 100% no slip ups or anything and neither of them have any genetic conditions but myself and my two siblings all have physical impairments of some kind. I have fibromyalgia, my sister’s stomach is extremely sensitive and hence she was in and out of hospital a lot as a child and my brother was born with clubbed feet. We’ve chocked it up to radiation from my family living near a nuclear power plant that caught fire a few years before our births but it’s weird how you can be completely healthy and do everything right in a pregnancy to protect your child and yet they still end up impaired or sick. It’s just another reason why I don’t want kids honestly but I 100% agree if you knowingly endanger your child even in pregnancy you are not a fit parent. They’re a small human who’s 100% reliant on you to survive, it is your responsibility as parents to give that small human the best shot they can in life period."

childfree,fj3jvhc,t3_fb8iza,1582985815.0,"We actually had a debate on this topic yesterday in my Inequality class. We talked about money for all SAHM versus working class SAHM versus mothers in general. The argument for it is to subsidise working mothers slightly so they don’t need to work 40+ hours to make ends meet when they have a young child. They still work but now can work slightly less so they can spend more time with their child and don’t need to funnel as much of their income into childcare. 

The idea is that the government treats SAHMs as more of a job but only covering the basics, it’s not minimum wage or anything but can help take financial pressure off of women in the lower or working class. Though some want it for all women but I feel like that’s unfair. Because if you’re middle class and are a SAHM your partner must make enough to comfortably support you. In this case it is a choice rather than a necessity to not work. 

The only form of paying SAHMs I can agree with is the first one, subsidising some pay for lower class and working class mothers. Treat it more as a benefits scheme that you have to apply for rather than a “oh you’re a SAHM of any class? Here take some more money!” But I do understand where the appeal comes from. If you can’t be a full SAHM but you’re never seeing your child because you’re working so much, then sure the government can maybe help you out so you can actually raise your child. 

Though the other argument is as we see above, raising children is a job and hard work as you’re raising the next generation and therefore should be paid for by the government like any other job. Argued that SAHM raise the children, keep the house clean, cook meals for the family, etc. Their ‘work’ is just as important as their husbands. Which I disagree with but it is an argument for pay for all women with children. 

But as a counterargument to this is well then people will be having children more when they can’t afford it in order to make money. And that’s the problem, you could set an age requirement like the kid has to be older than 4 or something to qualify but by that point they’re in school. But I agree, the system would be abused. Another counterargument is that if you can’t afford a kid don’t have one. While I 100% agree with that there are circumstances where people chose to keep their child or a child comes into their life without their explicit desire or want: ie. a friend of mine was adopted by her Aunt after her parents died when she was very young. The Aunt could barely support her but she didn’t want to see her niece go through the foster system because she was family. Circumstances like that are in some cases unavoidable and should be accounted for.

In the end I genuinely don’t know which is right or wrong, there are decent arguments on both sides. I can empathise with mothers who struggle to make ends meet but I don’t think a middle class SAHM should be given money for having a child willingly and she not working because she doesn’t need to/doesn’t want to. If you have that level of privilege then you don’t need subsidised but I can understand the idea for lower and working class mothers. But if you can’t afford a child don’t have one but then again financial circumstances can change on a dime. You could be comfortably living then suddenly need to pay for medical bills or car repairs or 100 other things that can put a dent in your savings and make things tight. I don’t know, just some food for thought and what a debate looks like in a third year university class in Madrid."

I’ve quit three times cold turkey and each time picked it back up when drunk. The longest I went cold turkey for was about 10 months. But I’ve gone from smoking a 20 pack a day to 1 or 2 a day or sometimes not at all so I consider that an improvement. But I usually pick up something else when I quit though be that alcohol, something food related, over exercise etc. 

I would genuinely look into finding a way to quit now rather than in 5 years from now. There are tons of books out there that my parents say helped them to quit. I’m not endorsing vaping as you’re young, but my mother has used it for the past 10 months to help quit smoking. Though I encourage you to do your own research on it, studies have suggested it can help with nicotine addictions but that’s in older people. And there’s no long term study on the real health affects, as you’re young I’d really research that before going down that path.

It allowed me to go out and do things with friends, buy stuff I wanted but didn't exactly need, and taught me how to be efficient and responsible with my money. You realise very quickly as a kid that £1 for chocolate = 8 chocolate bars OR you can wait two weeks and buy a new top instead or you can go for ice cream or coffee with friends instead. Allowance works well to teach kids responsibility and budgeting. And I think paints a good picture of the reality of life. You work and you get paid. Your brother should pay his kid, it's $5, unless they are scraping by NTA and you shouldn't pay their kid an allowance because it's not your responsibility. I understand where your brother is coming from like chores should be a family task sure but his pot shots at your kid and your parenting and feeling entitled enough to ask you to pay is such an entitled asshole thing to do.

Like some people say not to log exercise at all and only eat 1200 or whatever a day and no more or less regardless of how much you burn which is why I’m genuinely confused on what’s healthy and what isn’t. So many people do CICO differently it seems but I can’t tell what’s unhealthy and what’s just CICO. But thank you for your reply that makes a lot of sense! So it is net you’re aiming for not just intake overall. 

And yes and no, while weight restoration is part of recovery what I’ve done is not really. I’ve gained nearly 65lbs which is not really weight restoration as much as it is overeating. I genuinely need to lose weight for my health now so I’m trying to go about this the healthiest way I can and I don’t want to pick up bad habits such as accidentally under eating so early on. And unfortunately I cannot see a health professional for the next year as I am away abroad and I’m not covered here, that’s why I’m turning to the internet for advice on what’s healthy and what isn’t! But thank you for your advice, I’ll definitely try to increase my net intake so it’s more sustainable and I don’t overdo it. Thank you for your advice it’s really helpful!"
EdAnonymousAdults,fh2j47l,t3_f16ixa,1581254667.0,"That’s exactly what happened to me. I was very restrictive and nearly underweight, when I went into “recovery” by myself because no one knew about my eating disorder at the time it led me to overdoing it. Over the course of two years I slowly put on 65lbs because in my head I could eat whatever now since I wasn’t trying to lose weight. This led to me being slightly overweight and having an even more unhealthy relationship with food because I’d binge and then hate that I’d gained so much weight so I’d try to restrict then rinse and repeat. Now I’m trying to lose weight the healthy way and I’m really struggling to not fall into old habits again because I know they work but I want a healthier relationship with food. It’s just really hard to try and do it all yourself when no one else really knows how you truly view food then no one can really help and any advice they have just fuels one side or the other. I find a lot of people who went into recovery by themselves I.e. with no support from family or a clinician do end up going the other way. You’re trying to unteach your brain this horrible relationship with food and so you jump to the complete opposite. That’s why so many people with restrictive disorders end up with BED because they just go for the opposite of what they’ve always done because they know it’ll make them gain weight and that’s “recovery.” In my mind now, recovery isn’t gaining back weight necessarily it’s just developing a healthy relationship with food and removing the fear and desire for complete control aspects surrounding food and weight. But that’s difficult to do on your own cause you won’t have anyone saying hey that’s a portion for three people not one."

I won’t have a scale until later this week. So that’s the thing, if I am losing say 4lbs a week with such a low net do I therefore need to up my intake when I go to the gym? I’m just not sure when it’s calories in calories out if you’re aiming for 0 or negatives at the end of the day or not? I don’t want to get into unsustainable habits now when I’m just starting only to get screwed over by them in 6 months time if you get what I mean?"

I had a guy go to a club I was at sober because he saw I was there on snapmaps and then got angry with me because I wasn’t checking my phone to meet him? Even though I didn’t know he was coming? I was drunk and his excuse had been that he wanted to make sure I was okay? Like what? 5. Compliments on my ass or boobs is uncomfortable and I’d like you to not. Like saying “wow you have massive tits!” Isn’t really a compliment, trust me the back pain let’s me know how big my boobs are I don’t need your input random guy I met two seconds ago. 6. Saying what you’d like to do to me sexually is weird when I’ve just met you. And actually if I know you that’s kinda worse. I’ve had guys who literally I met two minutes earlier start saying really gross things to me out of no where. It’s not a turn on it’s creepy and makes me fear for my safety sometimes.

FastingtoLoseWeight,fgquams,t3_ezzf5j,1581031639.0,"If you’re planning on fasting long term like more than a couple days you need to replenish your electrolytes. Your body still needs electrolytes to function and you’ll need them even more if you exercise while fasting. If you’re new to fasting I’d start with liquid and maybe aim for 24 hours at first or even try IF (intermittent) first instead. If you do attempt longer then exercise is up to you and what you can stand really. I know people who fast long term and can still exercise because they’re used to it, others can only do light exercise and some can’t do any at all without risking fainting. It really is up to you and what you can handle. When I fast for longer periods I find the busier I am the easier it is which is why I usually fast during the week because I have classes and such. But just remember if you feel faint, unwell, nauseous, and/or actually pass out then it is time to break the fast regardless of your goal. Good luck and I hope this helps some!"

YTA - As someone who’s suffered with an eating disorder for just under a decade you do not have an eating disorder. You have an intolerance to certain foods or even just a preference and fair enough that’s chill. But eating disorders are mental disorders where your relationship with food is UNHEALTHY whether that’s eating too much or too little and becoming obsessed with your weight. It takes over your life and is your thoughts nearly 24/7. It’s not just ooh weird eating. It is a serious illness that can fucking kill you. You don’t have an eating disorder by the sounds of it you just have an intolerance to some foods. I’m also just confused about the vegan thing just this whole post is confusing to me honestly.

Though not everyone can do that and I recognise that so best bet is fall asleep with headphones in watching stuff or listening to music or just get earplugs. 1-2am in uni halls genuinely isn’t that bad, it’s annoying sometimes sure especially if you have a 9am but it’s still a reasonable time and you can’t force people to not use the common areas. The ONLY time I ever complained was when the noise was constant and it was like 5am and they blasted loud bass music plus yelling and drunk antics in general, and there was no way to drown it out. But we had an anonymous line you could text and a security person would come by and be like okay it’s 5am go to bed ffs and leave your neighbours alone. But NAH you’re NTA for wanting quiet and sleep but they’re also NTA for wanting to party it up their first year and have some fun. 1-2am isn’t that late, if it gets to be 5am then okay your concerns are more valid but like 1am?

eating_disorders,fga64u8,t3_exj60m,1580647197.0,When I went into recovery I developed a binge eating disorder almost immediately because in my mind I could now eat whatever! I ended up gaining 60lbs and I’ve been really struggling to lose the weight since as I’m now slightly overweight. It’s quite hard to restrict versus do what you do at night and binge too. So I’ve instead found eating healthier but more or less restrictive but exercising a fuck ton like I go to the gym upwards of 15 hours a week I’m slowly losing weight but I can still binge. It isn’t ideal but I really can’t break my barely eating versus the next binge eating 24/7 cycle.
AmItheAsshole,fg1156c,t3_ew4zxd,1580418875.0,"NAH - you lost a child that is horrific. You don’t expect to lose a child, I can’t imagine that grief. But she is also grieving. I personally believe that while it doesn’t take the same amount of work per se and aren’t a 1 on 1 comparison the grief you can feel over losing a pet can be that great as possibly what you felt. She shouldn’t have made the direct comparison but your reaction is also valid but I think a bit harsh. I lost a dog I raised from when I was age 5 to 17. She was my best friend and I loved her as any other family member. It’s been four years and I still grieve her death. Talking about her makes me upset and to me it is like losing a family member. I will never have children for a number of reasons, preference and also my health; I want many “fur babies” and while I know they will eventually pass I treat them as a would a child or any other family member. They’re a living being with emotions and who can in my opinion develop an unbreakable bond with their family. You lost a child and I am so sorry for your loss, she also lost a best friend and someone she grew up with. The comparison might not be apples to apples but I think empathy is needed even though the comment may not have been the best.

relationships,ffybe7u,t1_ffvl6oa,1580342414.0,"This is all very true. I’m still struggling with my diagnosis of fibromyalgia, it only set it when I was 17 and I was only diagnosed 7 months ago at 20. I can still function more or less. I go to university, I’m on an Erasmus year abroad atm, I buy my own groceries, I currently live by myself. But I’m finding it’s already getting more and more difficult to be independent and to get around without a cane or just some assurance. Losing your mobility slowly but surely at such a young age had been crushing to me. I keep pushing myself to try and keep my mobility in whatever way I can. I’m going to the gym frequently, trying to lose weight to put less pressure on my muscles, eating differently, basically whatever I can think of or a GP suggests I’m doing it. I realise I’m postponing the inevitable and that I will only decline and not get better but I’m trying to push that off for as long as I can. I have dreams to be an environmental lawyer, to be a linguist, to travel. But as my mobility declines these dreams have to be altered because it’s no longer as easy as ‘yeah let’s hop on a plane for 12 hours and go somewhere’, it’s what will my pain be like, can my hips take that pressure for so long, what will I do if I collapse again etc. This world just isn’t built for those with disabilities and that’s becoming more and more apparent to me with each passing day. 

I can’t say much on the dating scene myself, my boyfriend and I got together just as I was experiencing problems and he’s been with me through my diagnosis. He knows he has to help me sometimes but we’ve discussed the reality of my situation at length and ways to try and keep me as independent as possible so he doesn’t become my carer. A service animal, canes, a wheelchair if I eventually need it. Small pushes to get me going on some things and respect when I know I definitely can’t do something then he allows me to rest. We take it in stride, but I’m very very lucky to have found someone this supportive and who doesn’t view me as solely my disability and illness. But I know for many out there dating that it’s nearly expected that if you’re disabled you’ll end up with another disabled person or that anyone who is even “willing” to date you becomes a saint for doing so and for helping you. It can be very demeaning and I really hope I’ll never need to deal with the dating world but I understand how difficult and horrible it really can be especially when the reality is for a person that they most likely won’t get better."
relationships,ffvesu9,t3_evf9cz,1580262437.0,"As someone with a disability that can at times effect my mobility I’ll give you an idea of the quality of life I live. I have an autoimmune disease that puts me in a great deal of pain. Because of this at time’s my mobility is shot, and I can’t walk or climb stairs or really function. Becoming disabled at age 20 has made me realise a lot of things. This world is NOT built for disabled people. The number of buildings, metro stations, train stations, houses, parks, restaurants, shopping centres, clothing stores, grocery stores etc with steps and zero elevators or ramps is astounding. I don’t use a wheelchair but I tend to check everywhere I go for ramps for easier access since stairs are very difficult for me. There are rarely any options and I am forced to spend 5 minutes crawling up a small flight of stairs. Escalators are helpful but not wheelchair accessible. Your child will be wheelchair bound, that’s a lot different then using a cane or a walker. He will struggle to get about and there will be places he simply can’t access. You’d be surprised the number of places that have just one or two small steps for whatever reason that therefore become completely inaccessible for a person. I can function 65% of the time more or less as an able bodied person but my quality of life is not good. I’m not saying if you’re in a wheelchair then your quality of life is terrible but I’ve found a lot of people with disabilities while they trek on and are productive people who make the best out of a shit situation agree that this world is not built for people like us and there are significant struggles that can severely impact your life. If your son is ever independent then he will have limited options with housing because it has to be accessible, limited job opportunities too because unfortunately those of us who are disabled physically are for whatever reason treated as less than or even slow and we can’t do what other people do. We can just we need some minor adjustments sometimes. But it’s something to consider, relationships sadly too are affected, even education, and general day to day tasks can be impossible even things like basic hygiene.

I’m not saying what’s the right or wrong answer here I think your options are just finding the lesser of two evils. But this is in my experience and from those around me too with disabilities the reality we face. It is not something to be taken lightly. You can be happy with a disability of course and have a fulfilling life but it is NOT without some form of pain, either physically or mentally or socially or all of the above. There is some degree of suffering, and while you may be okay with that think about that child and what they’ll go through as they grow up and live as an adult. I know a lot of people with disabilities who wouldn’t change who they are yet they do acknowledge the hardships they went through and the mental health challenges they face now because of it. I’m so sorry that you’ve been put in this situation but I hope my experience can help shine some light on the reality of your decision should you keep your child to term. I wish you the best and I hope this helps in some way!"

Go rock climbing (indoor), hiking, if you have a dog or hell even a cat take them on walks together as a couple to catch up about your day. My friend’s parents have been married something like 30 years and are adorable and every single day without fail they go on an evening stroll together after dinner to talk about their lives and check in with one another. They have two kids but the daily stroll I think can be used in any relationship CF or not! Do an art hobby together even. My bf and I go to museums all the time cause I love art and he’s an aero engineer so we go to airplane museums and he teaches me about planes. Then I’ll teach him about art when we go to art museums or exhibitions. Learn a language together, I’m learning Italian, German and Japanese and he’s learning German too and I’m teaching him Spanish. Travel is another one but yes it is expensive and requires time off work and things. 

As far as meeting new people try to join these groups or programmes that focus on these things you want to do! A pottery class, a languages class, if you like sports find a local team, ask for advice in the gym or wherever and you’ll find sometimes when you strike up a conversation with someone you guys will connect and behold new friend!

You are one of the reasons why people have a fear of telling others they won the lottery, people who know them suddenly feel entitled to that money. Now you are 1000% within your right to want to work minimum wage and you are in your right to quit. But you become the asshole when you say your true reasoning is because you’re jealous and vindictive. You’re forcing them into a situation because you want more solely because they won some money. They’re spending poorly imo but it is still THEIR money you are not suddenly entitled to any of it. It seemed the previous agreement worked well for all parties, you could study, get paid assumably tax free and as you say easy money and then they got a someone they trusted to babysit. Your desire to change this agreement only stems from their new income. 

A family friend of my dad’s won the lottery years and years ago, he won something like half a million so pretty good money, he invested it into bits and pieces and became pretty wealthy but it couldn’t last because every single person who came into contact with him wanted money. Wanted a raise, wanted an extra £20, they were entitled because “I’m your friend”, “I did you a favour that one time”, “we’re family”. The poor man was also put in the local paper and then everyone he met at work or in public wanted handouts. He ended up becoming a near recluse and eventually committed suicide years later and donated every dime he had to different charities.

Those who win the lottery are 1 in a million, you are not suddenly entitled to a person lucky enough to wins’ money just because you’re jealous.

You clearly don't think of her as an equal to you either, as your comments are exactly as you say, just mean.

Best thing for both of you is probably to end it now. You guys are in your late 20s, plenty of time to find the person that'll be completely compatible with you.

They just couldn’t be bothered in the end and in the US the way religion is treated almost cult like compared to the UK just made them not want to partake in that side plus things such as payments to the church and the shame projected on some parents for how they’re raising their kids, the indoctrination being way too heavily applied to children, etc. 

But how I was born and raised was we didn’t go to church as a family but from around age 4-8 I went to a highly Christian preschool, summer camp and kindergarten. I read the bible, was attending Church at school and learned all about Christianity. Then that was it, the older I got my parents let me choose what I wanted to do. I didn’t want to go to church because it was boring but I did want to pray before my meals to thank God. I kept reading my bible up until I was 12/13 and then I kinda gave up on it. I figured if there was a God no amount of praying or worship should matter if he truly loved all his children and as long as you’re a good person and try your best that should be that. Just live a happy life. I’m now 20 and kinda “Christian lite”, I do sort of believe in God but less so. I figure that there could be something but also we could just be an evolutionary cycle that takes place on most planets from bacteria and we’re just the latest intelligent model. I don’t know, who am I to say what is and isn’t definitively? I find organised religion to be questionable though and I don’t like that side of it but I’m rather superstitious and spiritual believing we have energies or a soul to some extent, but that’s just my own ideas filling in the gaps. I wasn’t raised overly religious and I wasn’t raised atheist. My parents let me pick and choose, they educated me on other religions too as a kid so I could learn about them all. Today my dad is strongly atheist but my mum isn’t really and still believes in some parts.

So I think it is possible to be unbiased but it is very difficult I’d imagine to actually do so 100% of the time and successfully. But I’d like to think I’m proof of good parenting on this topic."
relationship_advice,fcqt4ir,t3_eij4a1,1577891796.0,"Hiya! So a lot of info is needed on this one, we don’t know the true ins and outs of the situation and your relationship and we don’t know her side either but here’s my take on the situation based off of similar experiences. 

Overall you don’t sound manipulative, EXCEPT for the university thing. Dick move in my opinion, you were selfish saying that’s she’s abandoning you? In the nicest way possible you’re a guy she’s dating at 19, why would she give up a potential life change just because you don’t want to do a LDR for 9 months? If you guys wanted to make it work you would and would be supportive of each other too! That said you did say this sounds like a rash decision, but if she was unhappy in her degree she should change regardless of how talented she is in it. If she’s not happy she should change and you trying to prevent her because you don’t want to do LDR is just selfish. 

You say she has other mental health issues and it sounds like she’s had a couple break downs before. She has an eating disorder, that explains the fast food thing. People with EDs binge and starve and repeat. I’ve had anorexia for 7 years, this pattern doesn’t really change for most. Yes encouraging her to eat is good, but clearly she’s not in any place to help herself and get better. I was very similar to your ex, when I first got with my partner I was just very self destructive and it got very bad, however over the years I’ve gotten better because I wanted to and my partner helped me along. But I wanted to get better that’s the key thing. By the sounds of it you guys just aren’t working atm. She doesn’t want to get better and you’re not equip to deal with it. She’s sick, being manipulative is part of her nature, when you’re that sick you just try to protect yourself and usually hurt others along the way. It sounds like her family system isn’t trying to help her get better either. You’re fighting a losing battle, if she doesn’t want to get better she’ll take you pushing her as being manipulative and controlling when in reality that isn’t the case. 

Obviously I don’t know to the extent your interactions are along these lines but this may give you some insight into what’s going on. At the end of the day if you’re not willing to put in the patience for dealing with her and she isn’t willing to try and work on herself then you just right now may not be compatible. She’s cut you off for whatever reason so to some extent you may just not be good for her without realising it, but she’s also sick so that’ll drain you too. I can’t really comment further on who’s the bad guy here or why it all happened but this is just my take on it, I hope it helps some OP and good luck."

Animesuggest,fbi833u,t3_edh6db,1576893467.0,"{Kaichou wa maid-sama} I loved. Don’t think it falls into cliches it definitely pleasantly surprised me when I watched it. 26 episodes and both funny and adorable. One of my favourites but underrated I think.

{Toradora!} is adorable and a classic I think. Focus is on a group of four. The two “love interests” like the other’s best friend initially. They therefore try to help each other out to get with said friend but instead end up falling for each other. It’s adorable and wholesome and highly recommend. 

{Your Lie in April} is romantic more or less. Gorgeous though sad, would give it a go if you haven’t seen it already.

{Clannad: After Story} kills me to this day cannot recommend it enough for romantic anime."
Animesuggest,fbi77cl,t3_edeex8,1576892746.0,"Soul Eater is a personal favourite of mine. It was one of my firsts and is still personally very high on my rankings. It’s 51 episodes I believe so a bit longer than others. But it has amazing and unique characters, is very funny, beautiful art style (love studio Bones), but also has serious moments and themes. Overall I think it deserves more love than it gets. 

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a classic, can’t go wrong. 

Violet Evergarden is gorgeous, short and one of my favourites but it is definitely an anime you’ll cry over so warning if you want something more uplifting. 

Kaichou wa maid sama is great and underrated I think and quite good for the romantic genre and it’s pretty funny. Toradora! is the same plus Taiga is adorable. 

I just finished Demon Slayer and I loved it definitely would recommend I’m looking forward to season 2. 

Psycho-Pass is good for the more heavy, deep make you think about society sort of thing. Though there’s three seasons and 2 movies so it’s quite a lot to get through. 

The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is also a classic but be warned the episode watching order is a bit of a sore spot for most fans, it does get a bit ridiculous. It’s hard to explain without spoiling so I’ll leave you to do your own research to see if you’d like it. On a similar note there’s also Angel Beats! which has a similar initial atmosphere but easier to follow. 

But if you’re looking for more shounen then obvious recommendations are My Hero Academia, HunterxHunter, and Naruto if you have the time (with Naruto though tbh after the main canon arc you can skip the later fillers to jump to shippuden, save for a few amazing filler episodes and arcs, in general the latter 80 or so episodes aren’t necessary to slug through if you don’t have the time) 

Hopefully there’s something in there you might like!"

Or if you both get up at the same time then you should maybe handle the alarms and just properly nudge her to get up when need be (this is what my bf does since I am like your gf and I set literally 15+ alarms over an hour or so usually when I’m by myself). AND I have a valid reason for doing it despite it seeming overkill. I have very bad insomnia but when I do finally sleep I’m out, like nothing can wake me. Which is why I set so many alarms. Basically if I need to be up at 8 my first alarm will go off at 5:30. Otherwise I will not wake up. BUT I only do this when I’m by myself.

P2: “I forgot I had it.”
P1: “Well did you wash it before we left?”
P2: “No. I just put a towel on it.”
P3: “Why would you bring a bloody knife on a bus?” 
P4: “It’s fine we’ll just bin it when we get off.”

I sat there listening in and just thought to myself, did these people stab someone? Cause it sure sounded like it did as they continued talking about “cleaning up being a pain.” They kept talking about the knife more and then about their next “deal” and I just sat there for 20 minutes highly debating calling the cops. I mean hey maybe they were chefs? Or caterers and it was a messy shift?

relationships,fb5qa6g,t1_fb563ni,1576532360.0,I’m kinda in this boat too. I’m (20F) with siblings 18F and 16M. Sister moved an hour away for uni but comes home at the holidays. Overall Christmas is a family thing for my mum and very important to her. Unfortunately it’s also a massive thing for my bf’s family too and they get ALL the extended family round. This is the first year they will be coming to our hometown instead of his family travelling to them. So I’m not sure how to navigate it this year. I’m sleeping on a couch at my mother’s so I’m there at 7am for gifts with my siblings and grandmother and then at 12 going to my boyfriend’s just to return for dinner at my mum’s at 6. It’s just so hectic and I can’t wait until I can just have a relaxing morning and day with my partner instead of running about seeing people all day. I don’t think you’re a jerk for wanting your own traditions I think it’s 100% reasonable but I can also see how your parents are still probably trying to hold on the Christmas as a family thing as you all get older. Our families are really pushing for it and I think they just don’t want it to start to be an event where only some of the family are together while others don’t come or do other things. It’s just trying to keep their children about probably and that’s understandable.

Is this the only thing your thinking of or are you really looking to be more adventurous with your gf (you say wife above but then gf in the text?). If she has reservations about doing that and she does it sometimes I can nearly guarantee she’s doing it because she knows you like it and feels obligated to do it rather than necessarily wants to do it. I was like that initially with my bf when he asked but I’m very adventurous so while I had my reservations after seeing how it made him feel I’m all game for it now. But I’m very not vanilla. 

If you gf is very vanilla you may find it hard to get her to WANT to do these things rather than her just doing them for you cause you asked. I’d have a proper conversation with her about everything like what you both want, your limits and go from there and see if you can find similarities or maybe compromises on things?"

Fibromyalgia,fah26ea,t1_fah19n4,1576077429.0,"Possibly? The reason they gave for not giving me pain killers was because they’re trying to “curb the opium crisis in the UK” but I had made it very clear I wanted something only for emergencies not for daily life since I don’t want to be a drugged out zombie. But since I can’t take over the counter stuff I’m kinda stuck on the days when I wake up and can’t move because of the pain and then can’t do anything about it cause I can’t take anything for the pain. Kinda makes planning ahead difficult! 

They just outright refused. So when I moved onto well can we try neurostimulants then or anti-depressants since I need them anyways and they just said no a GP must prescribe that. And I was like my GP sent me to you for prescriptions and they just refused. It was basically an hour of me asking for some kind of help for while I’m away for a year without access to a GP and all they could tell me was no to everything I suggested. And when I turned down the infusion the guy scoffed at me? Like describing something as “like chemotherapy” isn’t exactly a great selling point. 

I understand not wanting to prescribe opioids for pain to a 20 year old as drug seeking is a serious thing but refusing anti-depressants and anti-psychs made it clear he didn’t believe a word out of mouth and was just trying to get me out of there; was a complete waste of time.

Fibromyalgia,fagrppq,t3_e93i9h,1576069125.0,"I went to a pain management team right after my diagnosis in June. They gave me 6 options but told me as I’m under 25 pain killers aren’t an option (UK btw). I knew I was going to Spain for a year and I can’t take paracetamol or ibuprofen so the other options they’d given me weren’t practical so I pushed for some meds even if it was for my mental health and they just told me no we won’t do anything for you while you’re away. So I went to my GP and they told me only a pain management GP could prescribe things (utter bs). 
The options they’d given me were:
1. Exercise (I do 6x a week and was at the time)
2. CBT therapy (Apparently can’t do cause of my BPD)
3. Physio (Not here to do)
4. Pain killers (Said they wouldn’t prescribe it)
5. Neurostimulants (Said they wouldn’t prescribe it) 
6. A lidocaine infusion every six months into my bloodstream. 

So this old man basically told me either exercise which I did already or let them inject me with what he described and I quote “it’s like chemo but shouldn’t cause any damage as far as we know though it has a very high risk of clots, strokes and heart attacks so you can only do it a couple times” He was zero help and I’m never going back to that team ever.

relationship_advice,facgscv,t3_e8iwar,1575939214.0,"Hiya long distance here and similar ages. My boyfriend and I are both 20. We live in the UK and are 3 years strong. For half this time we have been long distance. First by a couple hours when I went to a different uni and now I’m in Spain for a year and he’s still in the UK. By the looks of things it’ll be another 2-3 years long distance because of uni. Long distance makes or breaks a relationship. A friend of mind who’s been with her bf 7 years came to the conclusion within 3 months here that the relationship wouldn’t work.

You two want fundamentally different things. If you’re having reservations then I guarantee with distance it won’t work unless you really really want to try. The reason it’s worked for us is because we’re on the same page. Both childfree, work hard in uni and understanding that it needs to come first sometimes: he studies aeronautical engineering and I’m a law student so free time isn’t something we have a lot of BUT, we’ve worked out a schedule for when to visit one another while I’m away, Skyping times, talking daily even if it’s just to say hi, we have a rough plan of our goals and all in all they line up. This is why long distance is fine for us because we both EQUALLY put in the work because we want it to work. 

Even if you love her and it sounds like she loves you very much too, if you can’t put an equal amount of effort in it just will not work. Honestly my advice is to sit down, discuss this and come to a decision together and if it just seems like it’s incompatible then break up. If she’s travelling to Europe for 5 months honestly let her free if you’re not 100% committed long term. Let her explore herself and find new things and meet new people, study abroad is what that’s made for. But if you do really want it to work it will take a lot of effort and communication is key in long distance relationships. 

I hope this helps some and good luck OP."
relationships,f9zmkro,t3_e7ek79,1575743161.0,"I might be able to shed some light on this one. I’m quite similar to your wife but I do it less often. I will suddenly start uncontrollably crying when my bf or I have to leave. Mind you this has been when in long distance not every time we’re separated. But it’s uncontrollable and I find it embarrassing but I can’t help it. I just get very sad when he leaves and it is partially because I love him that much and want to be around him as much as I can but then when we are in the same city but living apart in the city I don’t mind. 

I think it honestly has something to do with my BPD and anxiety. I just have this fear of being abandoned or that something horrible will happen when we’re apart and that could be the last time I see him. There’s also being left alone. When in long distance and he has to leave it’s heartbreaking regardless of the amount of time he visited for because I go back to being on my own again. But even when in the same city, while I won’t cry when he leaves or I have to leave I do get very deflated and upset the moment I’m separated. A sniffle or two maybe but this is always away from him. It can just suck being alone but give me a moment and I’m fine again.

I’m sure talking this all out with a therapist would help me loads (and I’m currently on a long waiting list for DBT) but that could be it. Your wife just loves you very much but her anxiety or possibly an underlying personality disorder could be causing her reaction to being apart. As her reactions are more frequent than mine and it sounds like you’ve chocked this up to a quirk but maybe one day discuss it with her. Because it is draining to be that upset so often. Maybe she knows she has a problem but hasn’t sought help yet for whatever reason or maybe she just hasn’t considered it deeper than just missing you. 

But I’d wager that maybe talking to a therapist could help her significantly with dealing with being by herself and things. All the best OP and hope this helps."

A fight isn’t worth it and it’s best to go out on your terms when you deem it necessary. One day I too will have to make that decision. My pain will be too much and I will become too unstable to be living any decent quality of life. I’ve yet to come to terms with that idea despite my countless suicide attempts throughout my teens. I’ve reached a place of stability and happiness but one day I’ll relapse and a decision will need to be made as I age and the pain gets worse. I hope I can come to terms with my mortality as you have. It’s kinda of comforting in a way to read how someone is at peace with their mortality and embraces it, I fear death but I know it’s a release from pain and is inevitable.

So my friend goes in, comes out and says “oooh it’s so cold in there! Felt like I was being watched!” Then my friend’s little brother who was only a year younger goes in.

But suddenly he yells ow and reaches for his back. He gets concerned and then starts screaming in pain saying his back is on fire. We lift up his shirt and we watch these long claw marks appear on his back, he’s bleeding and we panic. We watched the three marks appear and then when we run to get bandaids to help him. But when we return to our friends the cuts had sealed shut however, there was blood still everywhere and he kept saying his chest hurt. 

Nothing more came of it and we immediately stopped playing but now I don’t fuck with the supernatural.

My honest advice based on what I read is this is unhealthy and both of you should move on. You need to understand this: she will not get better unless she truly truly wants to.

Every time I’ve ever tried to recovery or get better I have failed so so miserably when it was someone forcing me into it. I’ve broken up with several partners because I felt like a kid being forced to check in with my parent daily to prove if I’d done my homework. It was humiliating and I eventually resented them. It felt like they didn’t understand and didn’t care. They just expected me to take my meds and be better and do better. So if I relapsed they’d yell at me, threaten to leave, the words “I told you what would happen if this happened again!” And it just sent me into more of a tailspin. The only successful relationship I’ve had is the one I’m in now. But that’s because I reached a point where I wanted to get better. I don’t take meds anymore because they don’t work well for me but instead I exercise, go to uni, am proactive. But if someone had given me an ultimatum to do all this, I wouldn’t have truly wanted to do it and would have done it simply to appease them and save whatever relationship I had. I am better now through my own work and choice. My partner is supportive and on days I can’t get out of bed he’ll try to motivate me for my betterment but if at the end of the day I turn to him and just say I really really can’t do it all today but I’ll do maybe one thing, he understands I need a day and will help me through it. I still fail sometimes but that’s normal.

There is a way for this to work with support and understanding on both sides and yes she is really really going to have to try but if you can’t accept that she may fail here and there then you’re not compatible and need to move on and let her get to a healthy place by herself without you forcing it on her under a pretense that if she can’t do what you expect of her you’ll just leave. I’d feel like I was walking in eggshells and if I ever couldn’t do something I’d lie as to not face repercussions. All in all OP I don’t think this will work, there’s a way to help people with mental illness in a proactive way but by the sounds of it neither approach you’ve taken I think is going to work unless you’re willing to be flexible about it all."
relationship_advice,f7h1gk2,t1_f7h1776,1573728994.0,I 100% agree with you but I was kinda implying that’d be an obvious thing to do first. I just assumed she’d set her own limits first and then approach him as talking points. She knows she doesn’t want this to be open. She needs to express that. But if she is willing to set boundaries or if they have a more in depth discussion then perhaps they can reach an agreement. You’re right he could sweet talk her into something she doesn’t truly want but at the end of the day communication is paramount. She can’t just not speak to him on the matter and be unhappy or just break up without further discussion especially if they are actually in love. I think they could reach an agreement if they were both just honest. But she needs to tell him the truth about how she’s feeling and how she isn’t okay with this first and foremost. If he’s a decent person he’ll listen and try to make changes or talk it out more with her. If not then yes she should just leave him at that point because they aren’t compatible at the end of the day.

If you are nit picky and need things to be perfect and a in certain way then I’m kinda with your friend on this one. Now I’m not saying you’ll be kicking people out and throwing a hissy fit but the stress of a wedding can really bring out the worst in people. I don’t blame your friend for not wanting to go but instead trying to show her congratulations and support in another way. You can’t force people to do things they don’t want to do, sometimes it doesn’t matter that they’re your best friend, if it makes them uncomfortable they have a right to say no. You pestering her about it and trying to change her mind even when she’s said no is kind of an asshole thing to do. I understand this is a very important and special day for you and you’d love your friend there but if she says she doesn’t want to go for reasons you already know, then that’s her right and you can’t force her. I’d leave it and just allow her to show her support in a way that’s better for her. Be respectful and understanding."
relationship_advice,f7h0llp,t3_dw7oah,1573727714.0,"Open relationships only work if both parties fully agree to it and you set up basic boundaries and ground rules. Is it okay to date other people, or just sex? Can you also sleep around? What happens if you catch feelings? Be honest. By the sounds of it you haven’t done that and had a more in depth chat about this. Unfortunately you either need to speak to him about it more and BE HONEST or it’s just not going to work out in the end and even if you don’t break up with him now, he very well might you after essentially have given permission to cheat. Open relationships can work, when both parties are totally on board and fully understand the rules and guidelines. You need to talk to him."
miraculousladybug,f7f09vx,t3_dvk1yy,1573669635.0,I agree this episode got dark really quick. Like the tone was so much different and I forgot this is technically a “kids show”. If I was a kid and watched this I’d be pretty freaked out. I think that’s why I feel weird about the episode. It was great but it felt out of place. The show to me while it is more mature hasn’t jumped into the deep end very much and for it to suddenly go full force like nearly Teen Titans style sort of made it weird. I’d love it if the show continued down this more mature direction but after three seasons of mature but light hearted scenarios overall I was both shocked and pleasantly surprised that they actually stuck to this route.
miraculousladybug,f7ezjaa,t3_dvmmwf,1573669178.0,"Oh my god I’m an idiot. HOW DID I NOT HEAR THE KIRITO/EREN/MASAOMI VOICE ITS THE SAME WTF, I really should’ve checked the voice actors list sooner. Absolutely love Bryce and he is indeed the king of male protagonist screams in anime. God damn it took me way too long to realise this."
AmItheAsshole,f7cdonk,t3_dv9ogm,1573589998.0,"I’m torn but YTA I’m very childfree myself and have zero interest in children. I don’t want to deal with the pregnancy, the hormones and then the 18+ years of child raising that comes with having a child. If someone asked me to be a surrogate regardless of the situation I’d be pretty pissed especially if I had very loudly and clearly stated my childfreeness. People are childfree for a number of reasons: the fear of pregnancy, dislike of children, the environment, finances, wanting to be free to do what they please whenever etc. For some people it just isn’t on the cards and that’s 100% okay and THEIR CHOICE. But a lot of people who express that they are childfree get told “oh you’ll change your mind” “it’s different when it’s yours” and get berated when they fight against it. Your SIL may have taken it like that, that you guys don’t respect her life choices and just assume her reasoning isn’t that valid and you could easily change her mind cause you offered money. It was incredibly disrespectful and I don’t blame her for yelling at you. She’s not an incubator if she says she doesn’t want kids, she doesn’t want kids end of story regardless of the scenario!"
