addiction,f77jaz8,t3_duflpv,1573459472.0,"I suggest, divide and rule approach! Just make some goals, plan your day, 

Most importantly while doing ANYTHING, make sure you've blocked the cloudy voice in ur brain.. by that I mean, give your complete attention to the task in hand, so if u cultivate this one habit, you wouldn't be addicted.. if you get a voice in head, then.. you can automatically block it, you'd rather focus on task at hand.. just remember I've been there at your place I've tried various strategies and none of themselves showed big promise..  That satisfaction you'll get will make you not want to to do that ever again! And when things get too tough in whatever you're doing,, remember to divide and rule.. take the simplest possible task and keep on improving the toughness.. 

I guess that is summed up.."

AskReddit,f5srj1x,t3_dp19qt,1572441229.0,"During my j unior and Senior highschool I've studied in a boys hostel, wardens/floor managers used to touch me inappropriately.. I feel very awkward and I walk away without confronting them even though it was middle of the conversation.. I didn't tell anybody because nobody would understand and rather bully me for ""letting them"" do weird things.. and believe me this is nothing compared to what I'm gonna say next...


Worse happened in my senior year, I got into a stupid argumentative fight with one of the fellow students who he is much taller and stronger than me. He was so angry and messed up about all of this, he did inexplicable things to me having stayed in the room just next to mine.. This happened not just for days.. but for months like almost 3/4 MONTHS.. then I knew I couldn't take it anymore.. I just came out of the box I've been... people will bully me for this if I speak up.. and talked to one of my very close friends whom I trusted that he could understand.. that actually helped.. after my friend confronted, things went finally normal and luckily, I was upgraded to a different School by the school management for my good performance in academics.. 

After that I've seen him for one time, in school meetup, I was weirded out and left early.. and there's no one I could share about this but, just the one friend who happened to be in the right place and time! 

If you think this is BS, you've to know India is extremely homophobic place, uptill 2017 you're a criminal in the eyes of govt if you're gay! Imagine living with that kind of place where you've to stay in hostels, far away from home to get quality education.. yeah we have it all!! Because of this culture if opened up and said, I've got f'ed by a dude.. and that too in a place of mindless 16-17 agers.. I'd be rather bullied than got rescued.. until I have broke to such a level.. and explained everything to my bestie and taken his help.. His initial reaction was.. you should have talked to me earlier.. I said I've never been more wrong!!! I did hint to another friend of mine though that something terrible happened to me in highschool from a dude, during my job..And never explained anything.. that's my story!"

Your future is like linear expression of a line.. 
 
Say your future is represented by a variable 'f'
Now, your skill is 's' and your effort is 'e'.. both of which are in your control!

Ideally f = se

But as we live in uncertain world, let 'c' be the external factor which isn't in your control, So.. 

we have f = se+c 

Heaven or hell it's what you make out of it! provided you're in an environment that supports you! You can always shift to a place where your future is secure.. 

Most importantly... skill and effort are entirely in your hand.. Just think about what an incredible time it is to be alive.. it is the point of history where humanity is not insanely at war with itself!"
