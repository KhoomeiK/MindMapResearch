And a criminal offense, to what, post a video of you and your friends at a party? At the end of the day, people need to be free to make decisions for themselves. I think in most cases, the embarrassing things kids say online will never come back to have a big impact on their future. It’s an unfortunate possibility now, but we cannot ban freedom of expression. 

The idea that nobody could post on the internet sounds like a dystopian dictatorship. Natalie couldn’t post videos in the first place if this were our world.

The problem would be if every straight guy got the same idea as you, soon it wouldn’t be a gay bar anymore.

I respect any woman who lives in a country that does not require them but wishes to wear one to practice her religion, but I resent that argument that it’s not 100% what it is intended to be. People are accused of racism and islamaphobia for stating the true fact that this clothing was created to oppress women and is still being used that way in most majority Muslim countries. They throw back “america/Britain/etc country has sexism too”. Yea no duh, but there are levels."

The vast majority of sex workers are consenting adults just trying to make a living. If what you really cared about was trafficking children, you would WANT sex work to be legal and regulated."

How exactly are you going to punish the people who “provide the services” without punishing escorts? They ARE the ones who provide the service. Nowadays plenty of escorts work independently online or at a club, not through some seedy pimp on the street."
