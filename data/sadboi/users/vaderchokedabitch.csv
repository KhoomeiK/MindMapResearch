‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all seeking that special person who is right for us. But if you‚Äôve been through enough relationships, you begin to suspect there‚Äôs no right person, just different flavors of wrong. Why is this? Because you yourself are wrong in some way, and you seek out partners who are wrong in some complementary way. But it takes a lot of living to grow fully into your own wrongness. And it isn‚Äôt until you finally run up against your deepest demons, your unsolvable problems‚Äîthe ones that make you truly who you are‚Äîthat we‚Äôre ready to find a lifelong mate. Only then do you finally know what you‚Äôre looking for. You‚Äôre looking for the wrong person.
