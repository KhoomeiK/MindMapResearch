AskMen,fpy2v40,t3_gg4cis,1588994811.0,My brother used to get picked on by the “popular” crowd and was a few grades ahead of me. He was never physically hit or anything but they’d just verbally go at him. He never complained or confronted them back. Even the popular lowerclassmen would make fun of him. He was a genuine sweetheart of a guy yeah a little weird but for no reason should he have been targeted like that. When I was a freshman one of the seniors who used to make fun of my brother was trying to do the same thing to me. Now I’m a quite guy I typically just have headphones on listening to music and just mind my business. So I guess he thought I was like a easy target and would just try to say shit but I just ignored him which I could tell got to him. One day though he said “You’re a pussy just like your brother” and I got heated I double legged him and slammed him and knocked him out. I got suspended but I was never was made fun of again😂

AskMen,fppkbm8,t3_gd8loh,1588803865.0,Her personality was actually perfect. My  “type”’back then was pretty generic short thick brunette . This girl was taller than me and flat on both ends and tomboyish sorry if that sounds harsh I’m not a attractive guy by any means either. We were best friends for a few years and she just knew me. Even when college happened and we were apart we’d still text and FaceTime almost everyday. She didn’t judge me for anything either and knew everything about me good and bad. She’d make these jokes that weren’t funny all the time but were so dumb they made me die laughing. And one day we were on a drive and I just looked at her for a sec and it hit me. Never asked her out or anything but sometimes I wish I did.

AskMen,fp7dn77,t3_gbcj4o,1588368659.0,"It’s kinda a dark reason for me but it makes me actually happy like a drug does. Just like weed, or booze or whatever else people do for them. I don’t do it to because I want to look good or be fit. I do it because when I’m running or lifting and it really hurts that’s my happy place. I don’t think about any of my problems or just about much of anything in general it’s just that ache and pain feeling which hurts but is extremely comforting in its own weird way so it’s pretty easy for me to workout and maybe motivation to go hard every time."

depression,ffi467k,t3_etrkld,1579964572.0,"It’s a trial and error process at least for me it is some things work and don’t for school,work,social life, and overall health. I think it’s just to not put a lotta pressure on everything and just give it a effort at the least so if I don’t do insanely well on something in school or I miss a workout or wasn’t really putting a shitload of effort in or I haven’t hung out or talked to anybody in a while. Usually something has to take a hit every once in a while. But have something you do for mental health everyday I typically watch motivational or calming video and pray/meditate and stretch a few mins a day and so far it’s been working really well for me and ik it’s not for everyone but you should at least have one thing you should do for your mental health a day  and not to rush and attempt to be absolutely perfect cuz I’ve tried it and it doesn’t work for me at least and the negative thoughts suck but they haven’t gone away for me either"

But it could be a adjustment period I mean wrestling does drive hard work and discipline more than any other sport. But if in a little while you don’t see any change in anything than I suggest you leave it and just work out when you can after your studies. There is a lot of dread in cutting weight and the workouts and when you lose. But there’s nothing like those 6 mins damn I miss it.

The only thing I have any urge to nearly cry about is that my mom cares for me a lot and I don’t have that balls to do it (kill myself) cuz I’d have anything else but to cause her any emotional pain cuz how can I do that to someone who’s showed me nothing but unconditional love I’m sorry for ranting on your post but I think eventually if you cry too much they don’t come out anymore cuz your used to feeling like shit"
