EatingDisorders,fj2uey3,t3_faa2ke,1582954344.0,"I, too, am a straight male in my twenties, who has been battling an eating disorder for nearly ten years. So there's that.  I want you to know that men absolutely get eating disorders, and you are not alone. It's an extremely painful experience to not only suffer with the illness, but to also doubt whether or not you qualify for the diagnosis. It's something I've struggled with very much, a kind of shame I've carried. I understand that, and I see you.

Our stories are a little different, but I can see similarities. You're not the only one.No matter how much weight I lost, no matter how much damage I did to my body (as a teenager I was on the cusp of hospitalization multiple times) or to my brain (when I'm deep in restriction my thought processes can border on delusions, my moods are wildly unstable, anxiety unbearable) --I insisted to myself that everything was fine, I was normal, I just needed to restrict more/lose more weight/purge etc. Yet internally, the whole thing felt completely unmanageable.

Please seek help. I finally made the call today, and have an assessment this coming week, Of course I'm full of doubt if I'm 'sick enough,' but for now I'm trying to quiet that voice and put my faith in some kind of healing from this. 

You can do this."
