Yet when they got a blood test it would come back with ""dangerous"" THC levels. While in contrast infrequent users (weekend/social users) were found to have very impaired driving even hours long after moderate cannabis use.

I think individual tolerance needs to also be factored in when testing someone for THC related impairment. The imparing effects of cannabis aren't as clear-cut as something like alcohol."
