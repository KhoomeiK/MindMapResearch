I have PTSD from a lot of abuse and have been through a lot. Even homelessness. So overall this is a cakewalk but not working, I realize how stable I feel because mental stability isn‚Äôt a normal thing in my life and have been struggling to get control of for several years. 

I have been fighting to get SSD for 3 years and my therapist says I really need it for these reasons, along with others. If I could do my own thing as a job with no bosses or coworkers, I‚Äôd be fine but that isn‚Äôt really possible.
