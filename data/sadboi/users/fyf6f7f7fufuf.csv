Cannot place any item on table.  Not minerals, food or decorative furniture.  When I select the item and hold on the table to place it down, my table gets taken into my inventory."

Sadly, your friends that thinks you're the asshole now feels entitled to your money and will keep on trying to use you as a wallet.  Don't let them pressure you, drop those that do, and keep those that stand by your side.  They are the true friends that you have.  It's time to make new friends if that doesn't work"

I play on Android 1.4.4 and I can no longer place anything on top of any table (food, docorations, gems etc).  When I hold up the item and long click on the table, it just takes my table back into the inventory.  Too scared to mess with my room now lol
