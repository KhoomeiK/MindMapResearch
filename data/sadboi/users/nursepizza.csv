And even if you don’t pick up on that, it was easy to pick up on the clues and cues the show was dropping about the water... big time. Smh 

I imagine the set sounded like this when they filmed: 

“Can we get another shot of that massive water bottle?”
“Show them at the water pump a few times.”
“Zoom in on Siddiq pouring water down everybody’s throats!”
“Show the stream with the walker guts flowing!”

Lydia running away confused me. I get that she’s feeling used but like.. really? Sit tf down, kid. But yeah, she’s probably super messed up so whatever. Is Daryl going to be mad at Carol now? I feel like he should be. 

Daryl taking his shirt off was like a “Hey guys, Daryl is still here and he’s SEXY ;) But don’t forget all he’s been through!!” 

And Dante was creepy from day 1. The whole mouth thing was too much. I wasn’t starting to like him because I felt like he was getting weirder. He made me cringe. 

All that being said, I still enjoyed the episode. The PTSD thing was getting old and then it all just got super intense at the right time. So, yeah, I had my good and meh feelings about it. Negan has been better and better to watch each episode.. he is killing it. They’re all doing a great job on that aspect. Performances have come a long way. I still wish Andrew Lincoln could have been there this season. To me, it’s surreal he’s never back onscreen :("

You also sound like you’re describing a narcissistic and/or sociopathic person. Was it amazing in the beginning? But different now? If you’re always apologizing, always at fault, that should be a red flag. I love being blatant too, but what do you mean by tells you things with no filter? Because sometimes, people will say things to actually bring you down intentionally. “You’re not the prettiest person in the world” or “you could lose some weight” — stuff like this. 

Sounds like an abuse cycle. Google “narcissistic abuse” or ask it if you’re in a narcissistic relationship. Read the descriptions and you’ll find your complaints are very similar. 

You may be in love with somebody you *thought* he was, but that person never existed. Coming to terms with this reality will help you to move on.
