I have no idea if DID works that way too.  Haven't gotten that far yet.   Maybe someone on this sub knows."
TalkTherapy,fjjwvku,t1_fjjvfsy,1583414516.0,"thank you.  I think my reeling comes from having seen my t last week, and blissfully sharing the diagnosis, but then suddenly feeling exposed.  My husband is very kind and accepting.  I can talk to my uncle about it but not my parents (oh holy hell, just the thought of trying that - yikes!).  It feels ok to talk to my brother, but not as good as I thought it would be to talk to my sister.  

Overall though, yes, personally I am very very pleased to know for sure/get confirmation.  So I can know what to read, how to filter it - to have a framework for undersanding and treatment and psychoeducation just as you mention.  In that regard, it's actually a huge, enormous relief.  

So I think most (of the 10 or so) of us are more pleased than the extremely wary/suspicious ones.  It is good to be finally actually recognized as we, as parts of the whole. Overall it feels just so very validating that someone else can see what we are now. Like there is a language, that some other people out in the world have studied and can speak, that let's us all count for real now - so we can finally say we and not I without feeling crazy or like frauds.  Like I don't have to necessarily, always, with everyone around me translate everything to singular first person, which is hard.  Oh the relief that there are a few safe places, like therapy, to talk about my reality.  The wary ones though are *very* wary of any change to the way people understand us, and mistrustful as how to go about this - I've worked all my life to cover this up without ever knowing it was actually a 'thing,' so I feel like I need to be consciously careful not to push.  Like I'd love to just spill everything about everyone to my t, because now it's valid, but also spilling too much too soon is hard to do."

Also yikes. He mentioned ECT as something to maybe keep in our back pocket.  Hoping this new additional medicine he's starting me on today will help me avoid that. At least, I think I hope so.

I mind a lot less people asking about the dog - actually the patches really helped, and for the first time, no one asked if their dogs could 'say hello'  So that was a relief.  Although I realize that of course is not always going to be the case.  I just don't feel I should have to owe answers to  every probing question about my weekly schedule or educate everyone about therapy.  I need practice deflecting.  

Thank you for pointing out it was good that I *didn't* dissociate.  That's one thing actually having my dog with me helps with, something I'm hoping to fine-tune and train more with in the future, but it's just generally very helpful to have her there to generally ground me.  It's going to take a while, but that's ok.  Apparently, it's already working and I didn't even think about it that way!   Thank you again for that.  It makes me feel like we are making progress and that we're going to 'win' (whatever that really means) in the end!  So many proud smiles to myself realizing that just now.

TalkTherapy,fj8m20t,t3_fc4kf5,1583116562.0,"This week in group, I brought up several times in 'values' and 'goals' discussions that I'd like to get back to my writing and finish my books and get them published.  They said I should own it, and say ""I am a writer"" but I didn't feel qualified because I haven't published anything (and also, kept this to myself, but that statement doesn't necessarily reflect how much work I put into writing well, because anybody can self-publish or blog almost anything, even if it's terrible.  But one of the ladies I like said her daughter calls herself a writer even though she hasn't published anything yet.  Also the therapist and one of the others said it was ok to still use the phrase - that it was correct.  So I wound up saying it!  It was amazing, it was both true (that I write) and it gave me sooooo much more confidence and makes me feel more relaxed about the process - for some reason, I can actually put my thoughts on hold if I come up with them in random places and times and I can believe that I can come back to them. 

For the first time, I feel confident I can put a thought down, and if it's important, it will be there later (common therapy practice/mini-goal when trying to reduce anxiety - it's just never worked before for me - I had a lab science job in grad school and every freaking tiny little thing you did had to be obsessively recorded.

TalkTherapy,fj1g1pf,t3_f8jqg9,1582919309.0,"My first visit back with my regular t in 2 weeks.  I told him it felt like coming home.  It was mostly good.  I brought in a poem I wrote and I brought him a small gift (\~$6) that had meaning but was super inexpensive, and he went over the ground rules for gifts, but I already knew he would take it because I once asked him if I ever actually published a book, and brought him a copy, would he read it, and he said yes.   The meaning behind the gift was that he had helped me get around to getting more help, and that it was really helping and making a difference, and that I felt change was now more of a possibility.

I was excited to share how iop was going well.  I showed him the new thing I had learned about meditating on finding your heartbeat instead of focusing on your breath (that has always been a trigger for me, so we have always focused on feet instead).  I told him about how they were good at catching me dissociating and helping with that, and that I think that they had diagnosed me as DID.  I told him straight up that DID was one of the few things I'd read about that made complete sense for me, and that the only other thing that I felt similarly about was like that was BPD.  He put down his notes and compared the two.

Because I kept talking about dissociation, he asked more questions on what it was like for me and I couldn't answer because it was too hard and so, dumb me, I  started dissociating and just imagining myself as not there anymore, that I was invisible even though I was right there in front of him.  He waited, and then he was like, well let's not talk about that.  And then he asked me to stand up with him, which kind of made me angry at him because I didn't want to.  And he said let's take a walk, so we walked up and down the hall and came back in, and then I asked if we could do that again, so we went up and down a second time, chatting about tea (because I was carrying a warm cup in my hand) and we talked about tea.

Months ago I told him that trying to talk was like having something to say, and knowing how to write the language but not being able to speak it.  I talked about how learning about DID was like finding out there was a language I could finally speak (I feel like Helen Keller - did not mention that though).  And how it was great at first but now it's overwhelming, and I am hoping that he can help me figure out how to use this language to finally be able communicate my life and my mind and my everyday thoughts to other people, instead of always feeling blocked off from everyone.

We talked about how I might catch myself dissociating, and about my taking back up training my dog Magic as my psychiatric service dog, about a new book I was writing, and how the IOP therapist and the women there had gently and kindly pushed me into saying 'I am a writer' which is the first time I've said that, and how that was both true as a description already, and how it was a huge confidence booster.

So afterward, now I don't remember much of what he said today at all, and I kind of hate him and never want to see him again.  ug.  And now I am fully disgusted with myself and I hate myself too."

TalkTherapy,fiz19h9,t1_fiyxqkg,1582851753.0,"I would miss those things too!  :(

twice a week for me does take some of the pressure (and sometimes urgency) out.  So in that sense, developing the therapeutic bond can maybe be formed in a more relaxed casual way?  Less like, I NEED HELP!  and more like I need help.  Which maybe makes the problems and the weight of them a little lighter, because you know that help is there now, and also around the corner.  Those aspects, for now, let me know I really still need 2x/week (or iop right now actually, but I plan to get back to 2x/wk after this).  

But give yourself credit too - you've went a long way with your old therapist!  It makes sense if some of the things you talked about with him feel kind of like they stay with him, because he helped you.  And it makes sense that some of the things you worked through with him, maybe you are in a different place with them now, so the *exact* same feelings aren't attached to them anymore and aren't there to share with the new t.  

You can create new history with this new t also - it will be different, and it will take time, but remember to be patient and kind with yourself and your feelings, whether they are looking forward to seeing the new t more often, or  discomfort/frustration/impatience/loneliness with feeling need for more established support/energy level/comfort/familiarity, and you can also be kind to yourself for having to go through the process of establishing trust all, and having to rebuild a new therapy rhythm all over again with this new guy.  All of those feelings are valid, and you can also feel as many of them simultaneously as you want to, and nothing is wrong with that either.  

In a sense, you've got grief to deal with for your old t, and mixed feelings about your new t, and all your normal and newer feelings about yourself.  That is a HUGE adjustment.  Give yourself plenty of room and please don't judge yourself or be too hard on yourself for that!"

The only thing I think that helps (that we talked about and I heard about in group today for the first time ever, so of course that makes me an expert :P) is to be compassionate with the different feelings we have, and to learn to love our feelings, as various as they may be."

I don't know maybe that doesn't help at all.  But I'm thinking of you, and I'm glad you posted.  I've been getting weary with the sub too, not because the sub, but because me - I think the changes I'm going through slow me down on being able or wanting to help with the same issues that come up here every single day like you mentioned. Like, it's so much to process that it's hard to put much effort here for right now. I'm part of that whole deal of posting repetitive downers sometimes too though, lol, so I can't complain too much!

It is good to know that the people I 'know' here are still working hard to pull themselves forward - I'd hate to imagine a less supportive sub around the topic of therapy than this one!  I especially appreciate you Sadpanda (and several others, just my mind is flat on names right now) !!

My best to you as you find your stride with this new therapist!

TalkTherapy,fircbdz,t3_f8jqg9,1582661648.0,"So tomorrow is Wednesday, the busy day at IOP when a lot of patients are there.  I didn't do so great last wed and froze up.  I have realized since then that it really does have to do with flashbacks to parents fighting, and to when the therapists we were seeing growing up were literally standing in the hallway (not of their office, but the main hallway of the building, with other people coming in and out of their own offices, and they were standing there actually literally yelling at us in front of all those people demanding that we go through a bogus reconciliation with my dad and that we would have to do things their way or they'd turn us in to the state and we would all be taken away to foster care (even though we'd already left the house to be safe) and that the four of us would be split up into different homes and not see each other or our mom for a long time if ever and that our dad would go to jail and the whole story would be in the \[major city\] newspaper with our dad's picture and how could we do that to him because he's such a great guy and we must just really hate him and been brainwashed by our mom to say all these horrible things about him and how can we not love him and that we must not be Christians or have the Holy Spirit because they were therapists in the church and the church had the authority to tell us what to do and how we had to do it because membership vows and power and threats. The whole point was we really didn't want to see him face to face, and thought that a forced apology was not enough to heal everything and all the wounds and issues, while they thought we would all just get along great afterwards.  And having to calmly stand up to all that in the moment and say, no, what we are saying is true.  I may be sloppily conflating a couple sessions due to blocked details, but yeah, those therapists.  (Why didn't my mom go find some other help?  Well, that gets into the abusive religious end of things.)

The staff and patients at the IOP are not this way, it's just the noise level I think and the therapy setting that throws me back.

I'm already having to fight the not freaking out for tomorrow.  I have spent the last hour just doing grounding exercises, and thinking about how sensitive and helpful the folks there are, and how well they notice what's going on with people - they'll stop themselves talking in group and just say 'hey, \[person\], are you ok?  Do you need to take a break?'

I like to imagine myself at least being able to get up out of my chair tomorrow if it starts up for me again.  I know it's stupid, but on Monday I cased out two closets that I could fit into.  One of them is in our group room, which is unfortunate because it will be really obvious that I'm doing something weird.  But I'd like to imagine myself at least not just freezing in my chair in front of everyone but being able to stand up and go into the closet and shut the door behind myself and just maybe, hopefully, at least be able to say 'excuse me while I go have a talk with myself'

ug.  I hate exposure therapy.   But I really need to be there right now, so I guess I'm going to just go with it and try for the best.  It's just when everybody is on break and things get cheerfully loud that it's a problem - I feel the loud part and not the cheerful part.

I can do this.  Every time even with my current t that I start a new therapist, it's super stinking hard like this.  But I've got this.  I made it through and made it work with my current t, and I've done it again with someone else since then, so I've got this.  um, right?  baby steps.  Going and hiding in the closet would be a baby step - actually being able to move instead of get frozen.  hiding in the closet at therapy is my goal.  Not trying to be dramatic, but I'm pretty sure no amount of essential oils and heart hugging and counting things is going to make tomorrow ok.  

But I'm going to go.  I'm going to pack my fucked-up self in the car tomorrow and go again."

TalkTherapy,fiqi71k,t1_fiqhf5l,1582644852.0,"thank you!  :)

yes, still struggling for real, still also resisting, but it is good to keep going back so often and to get a fresh take on the baseline of what's 'wrong' with me (I know I'm not supposed to phrase it like that, but it seems like it fits, in context)."
TalkTherapy,fiqgyus,t1_fiqanfp,1582644093.0,"Thank you for reading! It's 4-7 weeks more.  It's 5-8 weeks total, but I've been in a week now, and they haven't told me if it's going to be 5 or 8.  I'm hoping for the longer one."
TalkTherapy,fiq5eth,t1_fiq3p8w,1582635639.0,"thank you!  It means a ton to me that someone here has been thinking of me.  

it *is* good to be there.  My trust with the staff there is growing in leaps and bounds - faster than I normally ever even dream of.  I guess getting frozen, and people recognizing that so quickly and being able to help, and the psych actually stepping in to help and include touch as a way to help was just way beyond anything I thought would ever happen.  And then for them to pick up on my dissociation generally and my freezing up specifically and actually treat it as something real was -wow.  I knew they stepped into his office to talk about me for a minute, and I'm so used to just not matter-ing.  And the psych's office is *right there* in the suite, so sometimes between patients you can see him actually sitting and thinking about the next person.  I saw him doing that when I walked by in the hallway yesterday - and then he came and called me.  That was so weird - I mean, I know in theory that t's and p's actually prep before an appt, but it was so incredibly weird to actually *see* someone do that for me.   

I'm starting to feel some better, and am even able to talk about why that makes me feel bad - because if you've been feeling bad for literally years and start to get better you feel like you have a backlog of owing everyone everything.  One of the therapists there I was talking to about it helped reframe it as 'you get to practice feeling better'  which was an oh-I-never-thought-of-it-that-way moment.  

Was scheduled to see the psych yesterday and didn't even know it, but was glad to get to tell him how much DID really seemed to fit, and how processing was overwhelming right now.  He actually fixes the meds and encourages me to use the short-term anti-anxiety with a lower threshhold, maybe even keep it going through the day (I'm always trying to white knuckle it and go without - because what if in 20 minutes I'm better and didn't need to take it).  It is helpful to see him often and to hear that it's ok to take my meds when I need them (typing that 'out loud', it sounds  weird).  

Also the psych (like my t) wants me to eat regular meals and is gently pushing that (I eat a bite for breakfast, some lunch, and generally no dinner).  Was able to talk to the therapist about why I do that (because I couldn't remember it while talking to the psych, even though I had it written down to tell him in front of me)  - because I'm not hungry, and eating when I'm not hungry makes me feel gross and like I hate myself, so that I want to just go purge afterward.  So then I just don't eat because I figure it is the lesser of the two evils, and a whole lot less work and wasted effort.  We talked about ways to start trying to work around that, and to start trying to reframe my feelings toward food.  

They run the groups well too, not at all like my psych ward experience.  Also I'm really thankful and impressed that they are so patient and kind there - when you are talking to any of them, you never get the feeling that your time is up, or almost up, they just keep going with me when I bring up a real, significant-to-me question, even if it's tough. I know there are time structures that they keep (group start/end/break times) but one-on-one, they seem gracefully relaxed and focused and helpful.  and there's soooo much I need to ask/talk about - it is good to be going more often, because 2x a week with my t I'm realizing right now really *isn't* enough, there's just so much (for me) that gets left undealt-with, even though what we do is good work.  definitely impressed.

sorry for the tome!  lol"
TalkTherapy,finrcin,t3_f8jqg9,1582568699.0,The IOP is really helping.  I  wish it were more than 3 days a week but it's ok.  I will still be seeing my t one day a week and I do kind of need a day to get stuff done.  I definitely need this much help and every day I come here I am grateful.  They are awesome here.  Got to talk with the psych today and then a group leader by myself to try and problem solve some issues for me that have come up to work on.
TalkTherapy,fibcmdo,t1_fib76rp,1582319160.0,"I had something similar happen to me this week - frozen, couldn't move or talk, not once, but twice, and they helped me out of it and I bounced back sooner than I ever have - like it didn't ruin the rest of my entire day kind of thing.  When someone does that, there are just no words, and you wish you could stay in that moment for eternity.  Here's to being seen! :)"
TalkTherapy,fib60pp,t1_fiazg7a,1582315330.0,"It is meaningful I think when stuff like that happens because there is now a someone who sees you where you are at and doesn't ask you to be at a different, more capable level, or to be somebody or somewhere that you are not.  It is someone being attuned to you, and you being seen for who you are and being offered safety in that place where you are at and *not* being told - it's safe over here, come on over, figure it out.  But just being safe and ok exactly where you are at, and it is an amazing thing when it happens.  I am happy for you!"
TalkTherapy,fiaxr93,t3_f511ym,1582310503.0,"I am thunderstruck.  Been reading and taking lots of notes on a good handout my new psych gave me that's *not* confusing, and realizing how much of my life can pretty accurately and precisely be described by DID.  I'm amazed and grateful after only seeing me twice that he picked up on this and suggested it, and that he wasn't pushy in slapping a label on, but gave me the handouts to read and to think about and wants to discuss it more next Wed.  I always thought it was for people who had it *really* bad (as in not me), but it pretty much describes my entire life right there in five pages.  Just holy shit, ya'll.  I have all kinds of more evidence than what he's already seen to share with him.  But I'm open to what he says and not going to hang my own uneducated hat on anything.  But also, I don't think he would have given me the info if he didn't think it was true for me."

TalkTherapy,fi8dila,t3_f511ym,1582238207.0,I did better in group today.  It was a smaller group than yesterday.  I got to meet the lady who is going to start the women's group next week.
TalkTherapy,fi4ttys,t3_f511ym,1582148320.0,"well....took steps didn't self harm today during group, but wound up totally freezing up just as the second group got started.  They don't leave you hanging long once they notice a problem - several staff helped me out of it.  Once I made it to the nurse's office, the psych wound up coming in , which made me freeze up all over again, because I don't know him and was scared of him (he's nice, I don't need to be, I just hadn't seen him around/warmed up yet today).  He touched my upper arm, which no one has ever done to help before (except my husband) so I was kind of surprised after all the discussions on boundaries and touch on here, that he actually did that, but it was incredibly warm and kind and reassuring and super grounding.  Then he left his hand on my lower arm as he got briefed by the nurse and then engaged with me and asked if I was feeling anything inside - I said I wasn't -so he held onto my arm just firmly enough to point out and help talk me through trying to feel my pulse and then my breathing and hot dang it WORKED!  Breathing has never helped before (usually breathing exercises for mindfulness only make things worse because of past asthmatic/anaphylactic experiences).  He told them to  let me sit by myself afterward to let me process what had just gone on, and before long I was eating applesauce and water and walking to the bathroom and back to normal.  It was a surprise to feel that much better that soon and not just have to crawl into a hole for the rest of the day and remain non-functional like usual after such a big breakdown.

Having to leave group was embarrassing (had to walk across the whole room from the back corner), but the staff are really kind and manage to make you feel better about even the smallest things you do to just try and manage - things that would otherwise feel insignificant - but they are always like 'you did a great job at x to cope,' or 'thank you for being honest/telling me that is going on'; and the group seems pretty understanding.  I can't believe I ended up in a good place like this, it's a way big difference from my psych ward experience.

Wound up talking with the psych about diagnosis and options.  He is wanting, as someone said here, to explore and untangle the idea of DID, and I'm glad he's aware of how controversial it is and how hard it can be to determine things, but he's coming at it more of from the angle of let's take what's useful of it for me.  He gave me a handout on DID to read and think on for next week that he liked that left out a lot of confusing parts and, like he said it would be, it was easier to.  And dang if it didn't make a lot of sense in my case.  Starting to remember more things  that really help make more sense of things (sorry, I know that's vague).  Wondering about and interested in where this will take us."
TalkTherapy,fi4rr7l,t1_fi2bewc,1582147139.0,"thanks, this is it - totally spending most of the day like this until I have to interact - it seems like at 39 though it just gets harder and harder to keep coming back.

TalkTherapy,fi4pzm5,t1_fi2klu2,1582146141.0,"thanks for this comment.  It helps to hear it.  Your description of dissociation sounds really relatable.  And it helps that you mention that the tools of mindfulness aren't the point of it.  I think you're right too that I am going to have to work on relaxing - the idea of feeling what comes up fully though is really daunting...I have a very vivid imagination and feelings that I let run often become to much - I am constantly having to monitor them and decide whether/how far to let them go.  It's easy to get lost in a mood swing, but maybe what you are talking about is the feeling in your body, not your mind?"
TalkTherapy,fi299do,t3_f511ym,1582074429.0,"I think part of my loss as to what's going on with me is 'I can't have that - people with that symptom/condition are folks who have had really traumatic lives starting incredibly early in life and pretty much ever since then!'  I mean, I've always know life is hard/sucks, but I always just barely escape, or know that it could have gotten a lot worse - looking at other people through my own lens I see their pain, not mine, because my eyes aren't shaped that way.  But skimming through my life history (and I haven't even finished all the big stuff with new people though, dang, maybe real shit did happen to me and has added up."
TalkTherapy,fi25kqm,t1_fi1viwa,1582071980.0,"I read this but am going to have to re-read it a few times.  


among other places, one part that really resonates is ""It took me an even longer while to recognize a lot of my habits and personal odd traits as coping mechanisms. ""
Like I feel like a lot of me is going to soon be explained, and I have some mixed feelings about that.  I like being unknown, ephemeral.  But it would nice to quit thinking 'I can't function anymore because I'm just stupid now.'  


Like today she had everyone make a goal.  Mine was tiny and she had to help me come up with it - walk to the mailbox and back (~300' round trip).  She asked if it would help to write it down, and I was like I thought about that, but I couldn't figure out where to write it.  So she helped by saying, well, let's get out your notebook and write it on [this] page, and then leave it [here] in the notebook and then you'll see it.  This is my current level of functioning.  Fortunately, I can still get myself there and drive, automatically, but sometimes I wonder how much longer that is going to last."
TalkTherapy,fi1qkl3,t1_fi1mai6,1582062835.0,"Thanks.  I think for me I have to wonder, maybe I've just been saying all along that it's not a fork because I was taught not to believe myself that it was a fork (power through, get better by prayer, etc, and only discovering mental health things mostly myself, despite the fact that I'm not a professional - it's probably not unheard of to *under*diagnose yourself when you grow up in/perpetuate a dismissive view of yourself.  Maybe they're better at collecting the different puzzle pieces of things I've described at different times and putting it together.
  
Thanks for your comment - it has helped me come to the realization that I'm not sure I *dis*agree with them, I just don't know whether to agree or disagree."
TalkTherapy,fi1pyyd,t1_fi1b0if,1582062508.0,"I think you are right - there needs to be some untangling.  Sometimes some of my last thoughts are 'and now it doesn't make sense/I can't think, and then -blankness- and then 'um what was the question? I think there was a question?'  other parts we talked about were feeling completely detached from everything, which totally just happens on it's own, but it seems like that's where everyone is trying to get.  I spent so much of my youth spacing out and aslo daydreaming (I know those are different)  I was homeschooled and extremely isolated, so tons of alone time - blankness and losing time and coming back is second nature - the feel nothing/think nothing also sounds pretty much dead on, most of the time it's when I realize someone is waiting on me because they say something that I 'come back.'  I feel incongruent, and confused, but I'm used to that too.  I guess that's why I'm like but guys, 'it's not a big deal!!'   and it is certainly difficult if not impossible for me to live without it - everything gets too intense and beyond my capabilities if I 'stay.'  I used to knit, but if I try now I just sit there staring at the yarn in my hands and nothing happens, not even muscle memory on how to hold the yarn.

Maybe it's kind of like different sides of similar but not equal coins, and if you can do the one side of the 'bad' one, the other side of the 'good' one seems easy.  I guess I'll have to 'talk to the \[new\] t about it.'  It's hard though when it's so hard to describe, and they seem to know what they are talking about, and the more I try to describe what happens when I 'zone out' the more they are like, yep, that's it.  Maybe I do both.

It's weird (finally?) having so many people actually focused and consulting about my mental reality.   They already called and talked to my t on Friday, and I asked him what he said when I saw him then.  One thing they asked him was if he had noticed me dissociating, and he had said he had.  So apparently there's more going for me than I'm aware of...just nobody really talks about it, or something.  It's weird to suddenly have such a caring crew of people actually actively focused and working to help you so many days a week to reach a more complete something - kind of like coming out to the edge of the light after living in a cave forever - it's very foreign and kind of something else. I don't know how to describe it - I guess I'll just have to go through it first.  Maybe it's just that this IS what more support is supposed to look like, and I've just been ignorantly trying too hard to go without.  It's definitely odd.  like...wow.  that's out there for real?

There's the new team, and I let my t in on some stuff on Monday, and he was like, 'ok, well that's a really big deal.'  I'm scared when people pay attention that I'll say the wrong thing, but there's a lot of people taking me seriously and *not* gaslighting me about the truth of my life, and that's just plain weird.   Maybe that's why there's so much more coming to light now."
TalkTherapy,fhyysiv,t3_f511ym,1581986909.0,"I feel like I'm getting pummeled over and over into the sand by a bunch of tough waves, feeling ambivalent about trying to surface here and there.  it really helps to have a place like this to 'talk' - some place to say things, and no response required - i know I'm posting a ton on here lately - sorry.

I start IOP tomorrow.  I haven't gone back over my homework - simple questions didn't make any sense because I was so anxious/panicky trying to answer them, especially answer them 'correctly' and worrying about if anyone is going to check them or make me read them aloud because my answers are personal and they also basically suck.  So cue panic as I try to make myself tackle a giant pile of dishes and then homework.  I'm sincerely hoping I can go the whole 3 hours tomorrow without having to talk or say anything at all - maybe if I just sit behind a potted plant somewhere and keep my head buried in the dirt, no-one will notice I'm actually there.  Should probably skip the breaks, or the movement might give me away.

Also it's been what, less than 8 hours and I'm already in panic/spiraling from not being able to see my therapist?  I think due to scheduling I won't be able to see him until next Friday, which is essentially the same as forever.  Having to think about big Things behind si and sh without him - feeling alone in the  scary world of past, present, and future, and new people who will see and hear me and judge me - abject terror would be an understatement for how I feel unless I just block it all out, but then what's the point of going if I can't let anything be wrong, and then as soon as I quit blocking it, it all comes back even stronger.

I talked some to him today about looking for more pain in certain ways, and he explained it was like I had a broken foot and that what I was looking to do was like trying to run a marathon, that I shouldn't try what I'm thinking for like another year or two minimum and without a lot of planning because of everything.  I was like, but that's exactly the type of pain I'm looking for! (metaphorically).  And he just said, 'No, \[t\] says no'  So I'm holding off, but I still think it's a great idea.

Edit to add: just went back over the homework; makes more sense now."
TalkTherapy,fhxw5eo,t3_f511ym,1581963560.0,"My life is perfectly fine and everything is tolerable.  I find it interesting though that I literally can't remember a ton of stuff.  Big things, major portions of life were blocked out during my assessment last Friday. And I can't even remember little everyday stuff now.  Like why do I even need therapy?  Why am I even in an iop again?  What's such a big deal?  Why is it that I have a sense if I stop those, that everything will crash?  Because, everything is fine, right?  I think I remember making a decision yesterday to ignore a ton of stuff that might come up in the next weeks to deal with.  So that clearly, adequately solves all those problems, right?  

I somehow managed to talk about some big Things today with my t.   He said they were important.  I'm not sure if with my expressionless nature I conveyed how big they have been in my life.  He gets it. But I guess I'm going to have to find a way to get something more across and I'm not sure what yet but there's more.  And more impact. And more questions. It's complicated.

edit to add: I had an appointment at 10 today but it was written in my calendar as 12, but for some reason that didn't feel right. I usually double check the day of with my text message reminder I get, but didn't do it today. So we're all off at my son's parent-teacher meeting hearing about how well he's doing :) and when I get out I have a message from t calling to check on me saying he was surprised to not see me and that he'd follow up by calling the crisis center to check if I was there.  I call him back (still during my appointment time) and he says his 12:00 cancelled today, so I still made it!  Boy do I feel lucky - had some big Stuff to talk about!  On the walk down the hall to his office, he said he was trying to remember if I'd ever missed, and couldn't remember a time - I haven't missed one appointment.  Got confused and came an hour early once, but in a year+ of mostly 2x/wk, I've never missed an appointment.  :)"

It's possible though that I won't be able to see my t twice a week because of overlapping days/hours and schedule constraints, but I'm trying to see if I can work something out.  Everybody says maybe don't worry about it too much though because going to therapy 5 days a week for 5-8 weeks can get to be a lot.  My take is I already obsess about therapy like it was a full time job, so why not.  On the other hand, I can see the point of getting at least 1 day a week to just crash (I'm a mom, so I don't ever see weekends for me as 'days off' - they are more like 'days on' with lots of overtime hours)  I asked for a program like this because of intensifying si and sh (which goes along with cptsd/depr/anxiety/pd).  I 'had' to do something and I chose it because I don't want/feel like I need to be inpatient again."
TalkTherapy,fhox7am,t3_f49nwd,1581776770.0,"Can't seem to get my thoughts together here very well right now.  Something similar happened but it was actually true (I saw he quit wearing his ring).  That was about a year ago and I have only just been able to talk to him in the last couple weeks about what I was imagining (and knew I was imagining) was going on at the time.  At the time I figured it was none of my business so I didn't say anything, but it hurt to see him under stress.  The only reason it came back up recently was because of some recent events, so it was kind of pertinent to talk about it.   But even then, I only wrote to him about it and didn't really ask for what he thought about what I thought, so we haven't discussed it, and i know my perceptions were probably largely projection, so I kind of presented them in that light.   
 So far, since we haven't talked about it, it hasn't been particularly embarrassing."
TalkTherapy,fhorfzb,t1_fhnw42t,1581770942.0,It's ok. I did mean the new one in that comment but you must have read my mind cause I also wanted to ask about the session with your old t but couldn't remember if that had happened yet.  I'm so glad for you that it went so well!
TalkTherapy,fhoqw2s,t3_f1j08z,1581770266.0,"Wow. When they say intensive outpatient, they are *not* kidding.  I feel completely flooded today. Saw the psych for an hour and he would have kept going but I had to leave. Yesterday, last night, and today are super hard.  Fighting just to stay regulated today.

Still haven't started a ton of written homework.  Expecting that to end up being slow... Some of the easy questionnaires yesterday at the assessment felt nearly impossible to answer."
TalkTherapy,fhnci3s,t1_fhlq11c,1581724966.0,"I hope it works out well!  We'll be waiting to hear how it goes.  Hang in there, stranger!"
TalkTherapy,fhmgsyb,t3_f1j08z,1581712535.0,"Good grief I can't stop shaking.  Was grateful to see my t.  We kind of went over stuff from today until I was just like I'm not hearing anything you are saying anymore because me.  He was really kind to stop and find a grounding exercise and suggested walking meditation.  He got up and paced back and forth and it was so damn calming watching his feet.  It occurred to me that his footsteps were so much nicer and more comforting than listening out for my dad's.  It was so calming it  almost felt like someone was holding me and rocking me.  And then it was time to go so I didn't get to do it with him but I told him I was going to take my still not drunk, warm cup of tea if had made because it was nice and bring it back on Monday.  I did the grounding exercise on the way to the car.

edit to add: for those of you keeping track (lol) the psychiatrist was better than expected.  I'd space out and couldn't think or answer questions sometimes, but he was nice about that.  I couldn't stop visibly shaking like a leaf though, my whole body, it was so frustrating that I couldn't control it, and also very exhausting.  And then my hands would go all tingly to the point of pain.  And then I'd double over with my head in my hands. I was able to come out of it enough in time to leave, but the appointment with him got started late and I got stuck in traffic and I had to pick up my kids from the school office almost 90 minutes after school let out. I have a hope that I might sleep well tonight."
TalkTherapy,fhm0nr9,t1_fhlwt13,1581707072.0,Dr Doolittle.  It was ok but I think I'm a little older than the targeted demographic lol.  Just wasn't up for anything remotely scary or nerve wracking.
TalkTherapy,fhkjdr2,t3_f1j08z,1581685030.0,"Feeling absolutely fucking terrified today.  So I guess today should be fun. /s

the only redeeming part of today is that I get to see my t after my iop assessment.  But I have some big things to follow up from monday that I wanted to talk about that weren't about iop, so hopefully i can keep that part short?
Edit: well this was so much better than I anticipated.  They are really nice here.  And the lady doing the assessment noticed how I was dissociating while talking with her.  Still have to go back after seeing my therapist a few minutes to see the psychiatrist there.   They are already wanting me to work on identifying triggers and alternative behaviors though and in like I'm already doing that anyway so I'm not sure how this is going to really help much more except maybe just the being away from home and not getting stuck in my head.  Kind of frustrating.  They take your vitals on days you see the psych there and as soon as she said that and before I could think or stop myself I was like, oh I guess that's so he can tell how afraid of him you are  each time, and of course my heart rate surged way above 100!  I guess  maybe that's normal for me and why I start feeling breathless when I get anxious.  Now I don't feel so bad about that symptom.  I had to be like hang on a second I'll make it come down.  I hope the psych is as nice as the rest of the people there.   Also Sorry can't figure out how to make paragraphs on my flip phone."
