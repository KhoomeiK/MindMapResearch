depression,fqshqq1,t3_gkix6s,1589607604.0,"Wow, crazy that I just saw this because exactly that happened to me today with my dog. My dog’s crazy and my family jokes about how he doesn’t ever really care what’s going on unless it’s time to eat.

But today I was crying and he came into my room. He knows I don’t let him on my bed so he never tries. But he jumped right up and literally just put his cold nose on mine and held it there for a few seconds. I couldn’t believe it. I’m tearing up again just thinking about it. I believe our pets are concerned about us. I know some studies say they just act that way because “they get distressed when they’re surrounded by distress,” but even if that’s the case, seeing our feelings affect our seemingly oblivious little animals in any way I think gives us a little sense of purpose and connection."
heartbreak,fqcdcrm,t1_fqcb8p6,1589255478.0,"Oh yeah we’ve been best friends for 2 years, he “confessed” last year right before we moved away to college, he got frustrated when I kept saying i didn’t want to start a brand new relationship long distance. He said he was hurt and I apologized but then he cut contact for 2 months very suddenly, then last month is when he started speaking to me again like we used to. And he just cut me off again. That’s basically the whole story. He’s a good guy, I just don’t know what to say to him because he’s given me reason to believe he loves me but he’s also given me reason to wonder if he’s playing me."
heartbreak,fqc9i0o,t1_fqc979s,1589252976.0,"I tried to make this post concise, but it’s a long story. I just feel like with all of our history it almost seems intentional for him to treat me this way since he *never* used to act like this"
QuittingJUUL,fo0ba3b,t1_fo08d3b,1587409569.0,Yes exactly! I like to see it less as “failing over and over again” and more as “practicing” lol. You really get better at quitting each time!
UnsentLetters,fnlr86q,t1_fnlotkg,1587058335.0,"Thank you. I know I might sound stubborn and messy but it really helps me to point out that I have these three different perspectives. When I can separate and identify my feelings, it becomes clear to me which mindset works best for me, and it helps me see which “me” seems to make the sanest decisions."
UnsentLetters,fnl3hox,t1_fnklnu5,1587046237.0,"I really want to, but it’s really hard because we’re in the same friend group, and I’m afraid that asking for that closure will complicate things/hurt even more. I’m afraid to reach out and ask him for closure only to hear it in his voice that he doesn’t care at all, I’m afraid he’ll laugh at the fact that I still miss him. If it were someone I never had to see again, I’d accept that humiliation. But this guy will unfortunately always be a part of my life.:/"
UnsentLetters,fnk9cax,t1_fnk7jyl,1587019009.0,Me too.
love,fn40eiw,t3_fz69ma,1586631515.0,"This happened to me last year, and the feeling was irreplaceable. It’s just euphoric... the world feels perfect for days, weeks, even months. :) Im happy for you. Please, don’t forget about this post. If ever you’re in a tough spot with her, come back and read it. I wish I’d had a reminder like this when I let him slip through my fingers. Best of luck<3"
heartbreak,fm4i73f,t1_fm46y1c,1585754623.0,"Yeah, I think you’re right and it’s what I’ve been trying to do. It’s just hard to see that he healed almost immediately and it still hasn’t gotten much easier for me."
depression,fm36q37,t3_fspc3b,1585714319.0,"That might be true, but I’ve found that it’s not worth it to try to make people believe how much you’re struggling. Few people, a lot of times nobody at all, will ever understand *your* feelings completely and fully. Only you can do that. Make *yourself* believe it, make yourself understand your feelings. Pick them apart and organize them in great detail. Listen to yourself, be there for yourself, support yourself, because the frustration of feeling misunderstood by everyone else makes it all a million times worse."
