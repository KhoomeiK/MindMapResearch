I have used my bio degree for a few different jobs that really just need any four year degree. I have been a biologist, technical writer, supported living coordinator. But, I've never made more than $16/hr. If you don't want to go back to school I recommend trying to get your foot in the door in whatever interests you: volunteer, job shadow, internships, short-term positions. You can go pretty much anywhere from here.

 If you're just waiting to go to med school, check out open positions at various healthcare facilities, even doing a desk job can help you get a feel for that setting. I would also recommend getting your CNA license because at some places you'll make the same as with your bio degree and it definitely will give you tons of experience working with patients and nurses.
