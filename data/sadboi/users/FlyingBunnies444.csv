AmItheAsshole,fq5dlwn,t3_ggt8pm,1589101334.0,"NTA, I have autism and so do my siblings and mom. Vaccines do not cause autism. Yes people can have reactions to vaccines just like they can anything. I'm allergic to ibuprofen does that mean if I have kids and they're not allergic they won't take it, no. I trust science more than FB posts about how vaccines are harmful. It's better to have herd immunity so that diseases like polio and measles don't make a comeback. In my opinion they're a moron and they need out of their bubble. The only reason people can say vaccines are bad is because they haven't seen the world without them and the devastation that is caused by diseases that are now preventable."

BPD,fim32n0,t3_f8kdb2,1582516820.0,I was like this in the beginning of my relationship with my fiance. I started actually talking to him and telling him what I was feeling and why. I always said I felt ridiculous but he'd talk it through with me and let me know he still loves me just the same as he did before. If you're devoting all your time to him try and take an hour a day for yourself and take a bath or do something that helps you decompress. I feel like I need to take care of him all the time and that makes me moody and have tantrums sometimes. It helps me to just take some time to myself to think everything over and understand why I'm feeling the way I am. My mood swings get worse around him because I'm so comfortable just being myself around him. Honestly communication and taking time for yourself is the best route I've found to help with my mood swings and tantrums.
