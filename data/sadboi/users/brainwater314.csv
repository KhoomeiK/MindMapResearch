From what I've heard (from sources that are admittedly somewhat biased) there are US states that are banning all forms of ""gay conversion therapy"", without distinguishing between voluntary talk therapy and the abhorrent pain, shock, and other types of therapy.

In addition my understanding is that transgenderism or gender dysmorphia is often if not usually being treated (in kids!) with sex change surgery, which I also understand to have a side effect of permanent sterilization, or with hormone blockers with potential side effects like sterilization. I've also heard of a number of cases of people who detransitioned, but their stories were suppressed because it didn't go along with what the American medical association nor the American psychological association goes along with, because of a liberal slant.

Unfortunately, LGBT has been smeared in the mud by a number of stories of unreasonable people, such as the ""wax my balls"" ""woman"" (Jennifer Yaniv), who sued over 10 Brazilian waxing small companies for not having ""her"" balls, each with less than 10 employees in Canada, and most of them went out of business because they couldn't afford to put up a legal defense. Honestly I'm not entirely convinced ""she's"" a real transgender, because it sounds mostly like the worst possible view an anti LGBT person would imagine a trans person being.

Another objection is the use of legal action, either criminal or civil to go after those who misgender someone. Would it be reasonable for someone to refer to me (Male) as ""she"", ""her"", or ""Ma'am"" and then I successfully sue them or am able to easily pursue criminal charges? I don't think so, and many other people don't think so. In that case I'd try to walk away, disengage, and if they were overly persistent, it would be a simple case of harassment, not misgendering.

I believe a number of ""anti LGBT"" people are simply afraid that more trans Jennifer Yaniv's are going to go around and try to run more small shops out of business, or that more children will claim they are trans (it's already been shown to be very socially ""contagious"") and get permeant unproven (from what they've seen) life altering surgery or treatments. 

Please try to understand other people's views from their perspective and what information they've encountered, because it will help distinguish those who have a different point of view from you, versus those who think lesbian, gay, bisexual, or trans people are subhuman due to their status or belief. We can all agree those with the latter opinion are bad people and bigots."
changemyview,fi8h764,t3_f6wp70,1582240308.0,"First, how do you define anti LGBT? Are people who provide straight marriage counseling anti LGBT? In addition, if an organization opposes allowing a boy wearing a dress into the girl's locker room, are they anti LGBT?

Second, have you ever asked them what they think of the government being in charge of straight marriages? Some of us who could be considered as opposing gay marriage don't oppose the single issue of gay marriage, instead we think the government has no place in our bedrooms and contracts, and marriage should be between consenting adults that sign a contract in front of a leader (religious or otherwise) that officiates the wedding. If there is not a single religious or community leader that is willing to perform a gay wedding, I think we'd either have bigger issues than gay marriage, or we'd not have gay people. Since gay people have existed throughout recorded history, I'd expect the civil war to be more likely than a total lack of gay people.

Third, is it anti LGBT to offer voluntary therapy to try to solve body dysmorphia with only talk therapy and without surgery?  What about voluntary talk therapy that doesn't involve any pain or force if someone wants to try to become straight (( if lesbian, ""is there a reason you prefer female contact?"", There might be an underlying trama of a male assaulting them) ( if male, ""is there a reason you don't want female contact?"" There may be issues of their mother abusing them.)) There's a reason I qualify it with ""voluntary"". If it isn't, then it will have less chance of working, and it becomes harder to defend morally. I also believe coerced volunteering (by parents or otherwise) is not voluntary. In addition, I have no reason to believe most gay people are secretly straight with some underlying issues to solve. I do believe most people have underlying issues to solve, and the more unusual issues you have, the more you can likely benefit from voluntary therapy.

There's so many different facets of opinions and views, that the only organization that is primarily and explicitly anti LGBT that comes to mind is the westboro baptist church. (The KKK's main platform is white supremecy, other bigotry is based on their association with degenerates.)

Abortion is one of the clearest debates that has two unreconcilable sides that have a lot of trouble understanding the other point of view. From the pro choice POV, it is impossible to understand why people want to force women to become pregnant, and want to remove autonomy over their reproductive process, unless they are a bigot who views women as lesser and mostly valuable as a baby factory. From the pro life POV, it is impossible to understand why others want to kill their babies, unless they are a degenerate who wants to be able to have sex without any consequences and gives no value to human life. Pro and anti LGBT views are simply more complicated arguments compared to abortion.

My solution is that government can enforce contracts that happen to be marriages (with only regards to making sure the signatories are consenting adults), and should have no position on the sex of the signatories. In addition, if someone doesn't treat you well or refuses your business, then you should be free to give your money to a different business, and talk in public about the way the first bad business treated you. Government performing marriages was simply a way for them to gain more power.

Why the KKK is bad: it's based on a racist ideology that white people are superior, and that whites need to unite to fight back against the black or multicultural agenda. There's so many reasons the KKK is obviously bad that I don't have room for here.

From their perspective: with so many pro-black groups and groups for other races, whites need their own group to put their own interests first. Statistics show that black people commit crimes at higher rates (though when socio-economic status is taken into account, this basically guess away), and that shows that whites are better in their minds. In addition, seeing racist rhetoric of people hating the Caucasian race helps to justify their own racist views. If it's fine for people to say ""F*** white people"", why isn't it ok to say the same of black people? (Answer: neither is ok)

From an individual member's perspective: often it gives a sense of community to join a group, and when the group is hated by most people, that works to reinforce the bonds between people in the group since it is the group against the world, no matter how hateful the ideology if the group.

Your husband should support you as well, though is likely angry only because he is embarrassed his parents got an eyefull and is raised since birth to agree with his parents. IMHO the privacy of your own home is sacrosanct in what you do that doesn't affect others (e.g. violating vows by cheating, increasing risk of STDs for others by cheating, or burning your house down threatening your neighbors all affects others. Stuff like walking around topless or hosting consensual orgys or having gay sex is no business of others, except for fellow church members and sometimes family if you are open to receiving moral input from them).

I disagree with other commenters on the opinion of whether you MUST get your key back from them, instead I think it would be reasonable for you to get them to agree to some ground rules about using the key, such as knocking with sufficient delay, or making sure to call ahead if they are more than 15 minutes early.

I also think you can apologise without lying, since I believe you'd prefer they didn't see you topless. Saying ""I'm sorry you saw me topless, I hope that never happens again"" doesn't mean you think you were responsible, just as ""I'm sorry your loved one died"" doesn't mean you're responsible.

For example I think gay marriage is immoral. I also think forcing a group or individual to perform a gay (or straight) marriage is both immoral and should be illegal. However I think gay marriage should have exactly the same protections under law as straight marriage. Therefore if I were dictator, as long as someone was willing to perform a gay wedding for someone, they could have their gay marriage, exactly the same as a straight couple getting married.

Despite my view on the morality of gay marriage, I'd never separate myself from a friend simply because they're gay or in a gay marriage.

Please think on how your beliefs may be offensive to others, such as if you believe forcing a pastor to marry a gay couple against their beliefs is proper, or if you believe welfare (funded by taxes taken from me and you) is proper, since I believe using force for either of those things is offensive.

Having respect is about what we think of them and not your actions, for example you can respect your best friend because they saved your life in the military, but still tease them with insults."
philosophy,fb6n26y,t3_ebae6e,1576554358.0,"The argument I subscribe to is not ""less intelligent"", but instead ""not intelligent"", or more explicitly, ""not self aware"". Dolphins and likely chimps are self aware, but cows and pigs have no evidence of being so. Computers are also not yet self aware. Intelligence is not on a spectrum, instead it is on a tier list.

Computers are very intelligent at numbers, much more so than humans, but have no awareness to make them intelligent, therefore formatting a computer to repurpose is as moral as killing a chicken to eat.

Killing a dolphin or chimp is different due to their tier of intelligence reaching self awareness."

changemyview,fahd87q,t3_e94jdp,1576083846.0,"The US Constitution was specifically created to cause the states powers to be somewhat opposed to federal power (one example is the tenth amendment). This was mostly to limit federal power, and somewhat to limit state power. In addition, the US was founded on being skeptical of government and power, therefore without any more context, states wishing to succeed from the US would be consistent with those principles. Unfortunately, the reason for succession was slavery, making it very wrong, despite those who associate the Confederate flag with a check on federal power."

In my opinion, the following statements are similarly false: ""Muslims shouldn't immigrate to my country"", ""Most Muslims are bad for my country"", and ""Muslims are not statistically worse with regard to terrorism when they immigrate to my country."" The problems typically only happen with mass migration, when immigrants don't integrate with the culture, and when there are enclaves where immigrants don't regularly deal with the native culture. When immigrants accept the native culture, they are often more valuable to the country than a native born individual.

It's too easy to label Muslims as bad when a disproportionate number of them commit terrible acts in the name of their faith, so there are an unfortunate number of bigots that use that lazy thinking. It's also easy to see the plight of those immigrants, and wish to allow all of them in without being discerning over which ones to let in. In short, everything is more complex than anyone thinks."

Libertarian,f4s3fp6,t3_dlh4pt,1571774121.0,"The biggest inherent problem I see is the lack of transparency in the labor market. It's really hard to find new employees, and it's really hard to find a new job, thus the labor market is illiquid, and a company can survive more easily when it is lacking employees than a person can survive while lacking a job.

Another problem is the minimum acceptable standard of living, where you can't buy land and put a shack on it only meant to last a year or two before improving it, this preventing you from having low cost living while you are looking for a job, so people are much less willing to risk a job in order to get paid what they're worth and have their wants catered to reasonably.

Third, a company firing someone isn't nearly as scary as switching jobs or quitting, so people are more scared to ask and get what they are worth than a company is willing to ask more of their employees."

clevercomebacks,f3icfj5,t1_f3iage7,1570934874.0,"Have you ever talked to libertarians about nuclear power? Perhaps reducing the regulations which require at minimum the building materials cost 3x as much, not to mention the regulatory approval, 300$/hour nuclear engineers from the government needed to oversee all construction, and the countless NIMBY lawsuits they have to defend against? Despite the face that nuclear has the lowest deaths per Terra watt hour rate of all types of energy production. Maybe we should let the safest carbon neutral energy source be a little easier to use, instead of relying on unreliable wind and solar. In the mean time, natural gas has already reduced US emissions more than the countries that stayed on the Paris climate accord.

Sure libertarians might be skeptical if the government told them water was wet and could drown you, but often it is due to expectations politicians are saying that to increase their power and ban them from building a deep pool in their backyard, while the politician lives lakeside."

Edit: My dad started working digging ditches, took out loans for college & a PhD (while college prices were reasonable), and built his own business to make a good amount of money. My mom grew up middle to upper middle class, but she got a law degree using mostly loans, and made a good career out of that. While I'm a bit salty about this, it wasn't due to bad feelings, instead it was based on the book ""The Millionaire Next Door"", which used statistics to show that inheriting wealth ended up typically with worse financial results. I'm now curious if the top 1% of the top 1% are mostly those who inherited money, but those who are just the top 1% are mostly those who made their money?"
