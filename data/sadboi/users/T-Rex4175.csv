HealthAnxiety,fpi955v,t3_gdbnz3,1588636150.0,"It's definitely anxiety-related. I have the same feeling of brain fog and derealization fairly constantly on a daily basis, and it's been tougher due to the quarantine. But it will eventually pass, and I catch glimpses of clarity and, I daresay, moments of happiness in between the depression and anxiety. Had a mild panic attack earlier, but I've had good moments today both before and after it. Learning to notice them takes time, but we get plenty of practice by design of the disorders lol. You're doing great!

Edit: Was very distracted when writing that, forgot to add that meditation is hard to learn, but it is very helpful both on good days and bad days. Also good sleep quality seems to help me. I picked up a Fitbit a while back, and sleep tracking and walking roughly 5,000 steps each day is good."

I've tried metoprolol and propranolol in the past, and all they manage to do is exhaust me physically at therapeutic dosages (I'm very thin with a high metabolism, so most medication hits me hard). I'll literally wake up late, drag myself into the kitchen for food, fall asleep after eating it, rinse and repeat. And because my panic attacks come from feeling like something is wrong, that whole cycle sets them off. I've noticed that small doses of propranolol can be helpful with general anxiety, but I've migrated away from those since last year to try supplements instead. About to start taking NAC to try to help with my focus, since anxiety causes me a lot of brain fog and some disassociation."

So odds are that I'll still be very much fine for 10-20 years if I don't start negatively impacting my cardiovascular health. It sounds to me like he's saying that even if I DID mess up and eat super unhealthy, it would take more than two years of total neglect to significantly increase my risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac arrest.

So I'm walking two miles per day as much as possible, and I'm eating moderately healthily. I want to start jogging and running again when I'm conditioned for it, as long as I can push through the panic attacks and palpitations when they occur."

HealthAnxiety,fnu5wd3,t3_g3svbs,1587255176.0,"If it makes you feel better, I have the same story, same symptoms. It's been 9 years (I'm 26 now), and they kind of come and go, more often with exertion, alcohol, food and stress. My cardiologist even had me do a cardiac stress test a couple months ago, since I haven't had a checkup in about 3 years and it's never gone away. Had some PVC's on the stress test, but he said they were negligible, and there was nothing else concerning between that and an echo we did the same day. He told me that based on his findings, I'm ""over 99% unlikely to die from heart attack or any random cardiac events (i.e. drop dead while running) in the next 2 years, likely 5 years.""

I also have an anxiety disorder (not just health anxiety), and palpitations can be a symptom of that as well. Based on all the debugging I've done for the past few years, I think that my anxiety and cardiac anomalies are related. You might benefit from checking on that as well with a therapist or your general physician. 

For me, I just try to minimize their occurrence by watching what I eat and drink (no alcohol or caffeine, limit the sugar), getting adequate rest, learning to better cope with stress, and exercising responsibly. And when they do happen, I use CBT practices to remember that it's more than likely not a problem. If it's during or after exercise, I try to rest my body until they go away. It's frustrating when it happens in bed though, just have to readjust myself until things ""feel right"" lol. So far, I haven't died, and I've only had a few occurrences where they were severe enough to warrant me sitting down to rest."

AskReddit,fhrhv51,t3_f4gsxv,1581826661.0,"Here's a fun one - pierced my tongue at 14 by giving a blowgun a blowjob.

My brother and I got a couple of blowguns for Christmas one year. They came with little rubber pellets for practice (though they stung like hell when you got hit by them) and actual sharp darts about 4 inches long. One day a few months later, I went outside with our neighbor to shoot the real darts at our wooden swing set for practice, because why not.

To explain my fuck-up, we were supposed to load them at the end of the barrel, like a muzzleloader rifle. But, we found that you could shove the real darts in through the mouth piece you blow into, and 99.9% of the time, there were no issues with doing this. However, this was the other 0.1% of the time, and the dart got stuck in the mouthpiece with no way of getting it back out. We tried pushing it through with our fingers, a small stick, another dart, etc. We tried smacking it against the ground like cavemen. We blew into it as hard as we could, hoping it would just blast out at Mach speed. No luck, wouldn't budge.

Here's my nearly-fatal mistake. Me, in a total lapse of judgement, decided ""well if I can't blow it out, maybe I can SUCK it out."" So I put the barrel into my mouth, and I huffed it like the fattest blunt in the West. In the split second after I felt it pop loose, I thought to myself ""maybe this wasn't a good ide--"", and it ripped straight through my tongue. Thank God my tongue eat there, because with the vacuum pressure I put on that thing, it would have definitely gone deep into my throat/neck and I would've had some real explaining to do to my parents.

Realizing my mistake, I dropped the blowgun and looked down my nose at my tongue, dart tagging along for the ride. Feeling it, I could tell that it went all the way through to the bottom of my mouth (tongue bed?) Surprisingly, it didn't hurt too much, and I didn't freak out as much as I would've expected. I just took two fingers and placed them on my tongue at the piercing, and I gave it the deli-sandwich-toothpick treatment. I felt like King Arthur pulling Excalibur from the stone - it took a lot of effort, and it came back out excruciatingly slowly. Minor bleeding afterwards, but not enough to warrant a trip to the ER.

My parents never found out about it, but my neighbor shook his head and gave me a look of disappointment that I'll never forget. And I never used the blowgun again."

ElderScrolls,ffwyfwm,t1_ffwfcfd,1580313827.0,"You should try it again now. It's been out for 9 months, and a lot of changes have been made to the story, leveling mechanics, and item/gear/currency drops. They've even added a PvP mode, which is probably better balanced (in that any play style is viable) than many $60 games on the market. There's no chest timer anymore, and there's no need to spend any money on the game unless you want fancy cosmetics - it's a mobile f2p game, such is the nature of the beast. And you're not meant to grind out the game for hours on end, just set a task going and come back later. You wouldn't play Pokemon Go for hours at a time, this game isn't different in that regard."

Of all the coping skills I've learned so far, the best one for dealing with the exhaustion (and depression) is recognizing that the feeling isn't permanent and focusing on one day at a time. There are some days that the anxiety and fear stick around all day, sometimes for many days in a row. But it always lightens up eventually, even if only for a few moments. Learning to acknowledge those good moments is helpful in reinforcing the idea, so it becomes easier over time to feel and enjoy periods of less exhaustion and fear."

ElderScrolls,f23rrop,t1_f21cdec,1569935892.0,"One of the more interesting run-ins I had on my Skyrim VR playthrough (very important detail) was Taron Dreth from the Aetherium side quest that you have a random chance of encountering on the roads after completing the questline. He appears with 3 mercenaries that are fairly easy to kill, but he himself is a real tough bastard and for some reason would not break aggro with me no matter what distractions I gave him. He uses fireballs, and even though I had a fairly strong magic resistance at level 38, he melted me over and over again. Spellbreaker never stood a chance. I tried a lot of strategies - Stun bash lock? His friends would kill me. Unrelenting Force? Couldn't evade all of his friends and finish him off before he got up and killed me (or they did). Powerful destruction spells? His resistance was too high, barely an inconvenience for him. Slow Time and dice them all up? There's a glitch or something that prevents me from knocking enemies below half health while they are on the ground, and when he got up, he demolished me anyway.

I ended up having to summon a Nord Hero and a creature in advance, then activate the dialogue and run away to hide behind a rock to fire arrows around the corner at him. Had I been on a regular version of Skyrim, I wouldn't have even been able to do that, because in the VR version, you can actually peek around the rock and fire arrows without making line of sight with the enemy, so he wouldn't hurl fireballs at me while I whittled him down. Honestly, felt like one of the best fights I've ever had in the game after like 3 playthroughs, even though after about 20 resets I kinda cheesed it in the end."

AskReddit,etb1qeg,t3_canjua,1562634789.0,"Late to the party, but I have an interesting one. In college, I was shaken down for $15 by a couple of Buddhist monks when I was walking across campus. They approached me despite my attempts to avoid eye contact and started talking really fast about religion. Me, being highly non-confrontational, I just wanted to end the interaction as quickly as possible so I could have my mid-afternoon existential crisis, so I just kinda nodded and agreed while they went through their itinerary. Then they pressed some books into my hands, and I was like ""thank fuck, I can leave now"" and I turned around to walk away. But then they said ""whoa whoa whoa, you can't just take them, you gotta pay for them."" They wanted $10 for one and $5 for the other. So me, again, being highly non-confrontational, I whipped out my wallet and handed them $15 (which was actually all the cash I had) and speedwalked the hell out of there.

To this day, I have so many unanswered questions and so much disappointment in myself for giving in. Why were they not giving out free literature? The Christians on campus do (I'm in the Bible Belt), and they give out TONS of free stuff. Aren't Buddhists fairly immaterial? Why do they NEED to hassle broke-ass college kids for cash?"
