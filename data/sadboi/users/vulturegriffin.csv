AskReddit,fpj5hx8,t3_gdnhav,1588657187.0,"(Trigger warning for this if anyone needs it) 

I have 2:

Beasts of No Nation- Anyone who watched this will agree with me. This movie is cruel beyond words. I truly didn't know what I was getting myself into. There's a scene where a young mother is being r*ped by teenagers in her bedroom while her infant daughter is being stomped to death in the hallway. I count watching this as a traumatic experience.

Okja- I thought I was watching a lighthearted, cool movie. I don't think I ever cried so much in my entire life. That movie broke my heart in ways I truly never imagined. I actually can't retell it without crying. Similarly there's also a sexual assault scene, but it's animal on animal r*pe. I had never seen anything like this and I absolutely hated it.

Just don't watch movies with graphic sexual assault scenes, guys"

AskReddit,fpj1tin,t3_gdn8w2,1588654245.0,"There's 3 things my dad did to me that I would never repeat to my kids, if I choose to have them.
1- Punishing out of anger
2- Never asking for forgiveness after being wrong 
3- Getting mad when the kid cries

These parenting techniques that my dad lived by when I was younger (and sort of still does), fucked me up forever. 
1- Punishing your kids only when you're angry and not when they are doing something wrong makes them fear you, and the punishment becomes useless because no lesson is learnt from it. I used to be bad at school, and my dad mostly didn't really care that much. So most of the time he let my mom do the yelling for that and he stayed out of it. However he would yell at me and insult me for spilling my glass of water on the dinner table. What did i, a child, learn from that? That mistakes make me stupid, and that I can't forgive myself for fucking up. I continued to suck at school until I graduated. This is also something that the kid will probably catch on to and repeat with others. 

2- Never asking for forgiveness is one a lot of kids know. Proud parent, doesn't have the mental capability to see where they went wrong, or if they do they feel guilty in silence but refuse to admit it. I remember the first time my dad ever apologized to me. It was last year.

3- This last one, I personally think it's terrible. My dad always used to yell at me for crying. He threatened me; if I kept crying he will hit me. You can't possibly expect a kid to stop crying after you yelled at them and are now threatening to hurt them. Kids don't have a skin thick enough to take that yet and you can't force them to have it. But my dad sure tried to, and as a result I have been what I like to call ""emotionally constipated"" for years. I hate crying so much that I force myself to stop even when I'm alone in my bed at 3 am. Letting a child cry it off is a healthy way for them to release all the built up tension they get from their daily life, because life is hard, even for kids. 

I am older now, and I have given up on resenting my dad and blaming him for how I turned out a while ago, because it's useless. But I make sure that I never forget the mistakes he made, so that I won't repeat them and create another unstable adult who will have an awfully hard time trying to separate what is awful parenting and who they are as a person."

It's important to know that at the end of the day you're still someone without your mental illness, even if you've had them your whole life. Your personality disorder and you, as a person, are not the same thing. Personalities are a beautiful thing that make us all unique and they should be celebrated.

Good luck with your therapist :)"
AvPD,fi1d0la,t3_f5frds,1582055299.0,"I know *exactly* how you feel. I feel like this is a super AvPD issue, the whole being scared to ask your therapist about a diagnosis. I have OCD (not very severe so I was nervous to ask and get rejected). What I did was look up a list of symptoms before going to therapy and thinking about which applied to me, and then told my therapist about it. 

I simply told her that I had been thinking a lot about how certain symptoms affected my life, and after doing research for a long time I found this, and I think it really applies to me. 

I dont like to think of it as self diagnosing. This might apply to you too, so you could explain this to your therapist: I think that being able to recognize I have a disorder separates my actual personality and my issues. If my personality disorder and my personality are two different things, then this is a problem I can work to fix, and it validates my experiences. I'm not suffering because I'm weak and sensitive and I suck, I'm suffering because my brain is chemically imbalanced, and that is not my fault, but with therapy I can get better and be my best self.

I understand that you came here looking for some support.
The way I have BPD is different, and I dont lash out at people, so sometimes it's hard for me to understand why others do it. But I can still sort of relate to what you said about feeling guilty about hurting others, because I do that too, in a different way. 
I think sometimes all that's left is to accept that, at times, our actions are toxic and we're the bad guy. I think its healthy to know this, because this way we can remind ourselves that while we do things that are wrong, we also do things that are great, we're not good or evil, we're human, and we struggle with brain demons that make our lives harder.

BPD,fi14mtq,t3_f5urda,1582050531.0,"OP this is something you really need to work on. BPD makes it almost impossible to calm down when you're enraged, and that can make you end up saying things you dont mean. It's not your fault, I'm sure your boyfriend knows this, but it's not healthy for him to be with someone who says things like that to him. You owe it to him to work hard to be someone who can hold their tongue and not say hurtful things when they're angry. 
Speaking from experience, loving someone who's great and fun when they're in a good mood, but violent when theyre in a bad mood is troubling. It makes you do things like blame yourself and feel resentment. It kills your self esteem. 

I hope I'm not being to harsh, this must be so hard for you, and for your boyfriend too. You cant change having BPD, but you can change your actions, even if its hard. This behaviour is unacceptable, and apologizing every time you get angry is not enough. 
I wish you good luck, I know you mean well. It's good that you recognize that what you're doing is wrong, that's the first step. :)"

I just want to assure you that figuring out your sexuality sometimes takes a lifetime of soul searching.
Trauma can turn you off men, but that doesnt necessarily mean you're a lesbian. The good news is, you don't have to label yourself as anything if you dont want to. Currently you seem to identify as ""Lesbian because of sexual abuse"", but if you want, you can always use other words, like queer, which is an umbrella term that a lot of people have been using lately. 
Figuring out your sexuality is so much harder when you've had a complicated sexual history. Just remember that nobody's forcing you to pick a label, and you don't ever have to do anything that you're not comfortable doing. If you wanna sleep with girls and be in control because it's how you feel safe, that's great. Maybe as you heal, you keep your options open and meet a guy who's a good person and respects you, that's great too. 
Give yourself time to heal and to grow, and your head will eventually become clearer. Theres no pressure, and theres no rush. Just try to be the happiest you can be. 
I hope you have a good day :)"
sexuality,fgxw90r,t3_f0iycd,1581177229.0,"hi! I'm no expert, I'm not really trans myself, but my best friend is and I like to read a lot about being trans and gender dysphoria to understand it more. 
Now, to me it seems like your head isnt at a 100% male place. You said you're comfortable with being referred to as she, but also as he. You said that your breast and feminine stature make you uncomfortable, and youd like to grow facial hair. 
I believe gender is a spectrum, at one end you have male, and the other you have female. Perhaps you will find yourself in the middle of that spectrum. That's usually called being non binary, not a male, or a female. And that's great! There are a lot of non binary people in social media who you can talk to about their experiences. Some go by they, others by she, others by he and others dont really care all that much about pronouns. 
The thing about being non binary is that you can have gender dysphoria that makes you long for looking androgynous, maybe androgynous and sort of masculine or feminine, or just completely neutral. 
However, like I said, this is just my opinion. 
Discovering your gender or sexuality requires years and years of soul searching. You have to question it and maybe also experiment to discover yourself. You could try chest binding, or asking your friends to call you by certain pronouns, etc. Maybe you end up being a trans male, and maybe that's what you wanted all along, but gender is confusing. 
I hope this helped :) have a great day"
