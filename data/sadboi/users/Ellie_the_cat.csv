mentalillness,f2l3u6q,t3_ddgqha,1570291624.0,"I‚Äôm hearing you say you like philosophy, but some times it creates fear or existential dread?
Have you read about absurdism or determinism? They may help you with your anxiety and depression. Just a thought! 
I totally understand it being frustrating when people say that tho. I also have anxiety, and smoking weed makes it worse for me. I‚Äôve started trying to tell myself that when people do that, they‚Äôre only trying to help the way they know how. They will never understand your experience with anxiety/depression. It‚Äôs interesting how people who don‚Äôt understand mental illness or are uncomfortable with it try to give advice instead of just sitting in your pain with you and hearing how you‚Äôre feeling.
I hear you though. And I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre struggling with these problems. That must be really, really painful and lonely. Existential dread is terrifying, and I don‚Äôt think people quite understand unless they‚Äôve been there. But, you are not alone in feeling this way, even tho the people around you cannot relate.

Everything is dark gray and I feel like I‚Äôm walking through molasses. I escape into dreams or books to avoid overthinking about things I have to do.

mentalillness,ezwiszs,t3_d2koke,1568217654.0,"We aren‚Äôt allowed to diagnose on here, but I can give you some advice that helped me.
Try to focus more on the symptoms, rather than the diagnosis. I know getting an official diagnosis can feel validating, but the purpose of a diagnosis is more for insurance companies & doctors so they know what they‚Äôre dealing with and how to help you.
If you focus on the symptoms/your feelings/your actions, you have a better chance at learning what triggers you and how to help yourself control/decrease the behaviors. Once you figure out the problems, look into good coping skills to help with those problems! Self help books do wonders. I believe the more self aware you are, the more likely you‚Äôll be to help yourself heal.
Good luck and try not to worry too much about diagnosis. Your feelings are valid with or without another person‚Äôs agreement. üíõ"
