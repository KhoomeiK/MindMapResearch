PublicFreakout,f1n6pio,t3_d9zfko,1569610232.0,Signs your new husband has anger issues... 😬
addiction,ezy2i3w,t1_ezxim6h,1568255926.0,"Agreed! 😊 (future LADC, LPCC)"
addiction,ezy2ett,t3_d2wk9u,1568255854.0,"Everything in moderation. It sounds like you’re looking for a cross addiction which is unhealthy. You don’t want to move from one addiction to another. I suggest seeing a therapist or an outpatient substance counselor to help you cope with these feelings. When you take away the drug, you still have underlying “stuff” to deal with. Hope this is helpful. I’m rooting for you."
Minneapolis,ezy26tz,t3_d2pn24,1568255685.0,I live in Apple Valley and was woke up at 4:30 ish because of the huge crack or thunder. My heart was racing. I was dead asleep
mentalhealth,etmxm2z,t3_cc5hp6,1562971178.0,Sounds like they are having some countertransference and is really lacking in therapeutic education and experience. I am sorry this happened to you.
minnesota,esz0ofl,t1_esyr4ix,1562353059.0,I guess that depends on who you’re talking to. A charge on your record is there and a fine is a fine. Personally I like to have money in my pocket and a clean record 😊 that’s just me though
minnesota,esypnvj,t1_esugrnn,1562347176.0,A tickets a ticket 🤷🏼‍♀️ either way it’s unsafe 😳
minnesota,esubi3g,t3_c97p06,1562280904.0,"I wouldn’t have taken a picture of the sensor due to the fact that MN is cracking down on cell phone use while driving. If you were nervous about the red light, be even more nervous about getting a ticket for using your phone while driving... 😬 super dangerous even if you were at a red light."
BlackPeopleTwitter,esua5sy,t3_c9558g,1562280329.0,Can you give one example of when a white person played a black person? Your point is invalid.
GirlsIncarcerated,esju2n8,t3_c81yil,1562041944.0,Agree with the last reply. I also agree that it was interesting they had hair straighteners. 😬
GirlsIncarcerated,esjtizq,t1_esjmuqr,1562041523.0,Not so much psychopathic- she was on drugs. Not minimizing her behavior just pointing out her addiction.
GirlsIncarcerated,esjteh5,t3_c82t9i,1562041427.0,I agree with you. She knows how to act to get what she wants. I think she should have served her whole sentence. I also think they should have an opportunity for her to see her daughter and start a relationship with her prior to her release. She needs to learn how to be a mom.
therapists,esiylsp,t3_c81fit,1562022704.0,I worked as a behavior technician at an adolescent day treatment and learned after my undergrad. I am just finishing up classes for my master’s program. That isn’t something you just “get” and it varies company to company. I hope your supervisor gives you feedback and guidance on how to write clinically. Best of luck!
therapists,esg8725,t3_c6bblb,1561945747.0,I chose one that some of my co-workers went to. They enjoyed their program and it was one of the lower cost options.
GirlsIncarcerated,esey65s,t1_esencuz,1561912499.0,Hmm. I’m not too concerned with the adults. You need to have physical power when working with the kids and restraining them.
therapists,esdxf0n,t3_c6bblb,1561872145.0,Personally I have not. But I am in a masters program right now and I’d say 40% of the people in my classes are in your shoes. I think it really depends on the school you go to but it is definitely possible and not out of the ordinary. Good luck! 😊
therapists,esdwumu,t3_c71h49,1561871547.0,I went to school for corrections (to be a probation officer) and minored in psychology. My grad school doesn’t look at your undergraduate degree. Many people in my program for counseling are going into their second career and haven’t been to school in 10 years. You should be fine as far as majoring in sociology but it may be smart to take some psychology classes to prepare you for graduate school. Good luck 😊
GirlsIncarcerated,esdw6nh,t1_epqizpf,1561870835.0,Also a lot of these girls were on meth and other drugs- let’s keep that in mind.. it’s good some of them are gaining weight!!
GirlsIncarcerated,esdvkzh,t3_c5d723,1561870225.0,You will never win a power struggle with a teenager 😂 I noticed the power struggles the staff engaged in too and it made me cringe 😩
GirlsIncarcerated,esduzds,t1_es87x7r,1561869624.0,"I think this program has more of a therapeutic aspect than a lot of others. Also remember this is on a TV show so we don’t see 100% of what’s happening. I liked the aspect of accountability they made the girls take when they would damage property, they also had conflict resolution skills they taught and implemented a few times on the show. This show wasn’t made to show how therapeutic a corrections facility is- it’s more about the drama between the girls and within the facility as a whole. 

I also do not believe you need a women of color in charge. The Galipeau is a great man in power and acts as a positive male in their lives that holds them accountable for their actions . Many of the girls called him “dad” because he is the kind of man they wished their father was. There were plenty of women of color working in the building the girls could go to if they felt the need."
GirlsIncarcerated,esdubf6,t3_c6ddbg,1561868971.0,"All of these girls have their own issues. Reyes is more outward and vocal about her issues. Like they said in the show “many girls bully to avoid being bullied”. Reyes also says she treats people like she was treated in the past (this is called the cycle of violence). I am not dismissing her actions but she needs help just like the rest of the girls. She is 14 years old and has gone through more than many people have in their whole lifetime. She needs a stable home, guidance and positive people in her life."
