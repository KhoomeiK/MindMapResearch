But if you‚Äôre all dosing up, your pals will still likely trip, yours just might be a bit more intense but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd all be able to appreciate it together and I can guarantee the next day you‚Äôll all have a sore stomach from laughing so much at the crazy shit you see, say and do.

Doing the 400ug definitely sent me through to the other side and if you wanna experience a full blown trip I‚Äôd recommend it. But be wary because as mentioned in the report I had literally no control, nothing makes sense anymore and it truly is a mind blowing experience, makes you realise how fragile your brain is, but nether the less, absolutely amazing. But if you taken the 230ug before, I would just expect a much more intense version of what you‚Äôve already experienced."

Anxiety,fp9vxvd,t3_gbnjuv,1588435681.0,"I agree, having an excuse to stay inside and enjoy my own company has been therapeutic for my anxiety. Dreading having to go back to normality and deal with all the responsibilities that involve leaving the house such as work or socialising with friends. Even the smaller things like going out on my bike or getting the bus are sure to trigger my anxiety and the time I‚Äôve had apart from it all will surely make it harder to get back into it again.

I can‚Äôt quite grasp the concept of how certain people have applied a negative stance on a geezer simply trying to get some advice based on others experiences, which I think is perfectly normal. 

But hey-ho, I shall not dwell on the negative and merely focus on the positive points made. Perhaps, I didn‚Äôt disclose enough info on my situation and people are assuming I simply haven‚Äôt tried, which is far from the truth."

Drugs,fp3yjot,t3_gb3git,1588288216.0,I admire your determination to stop and I wish I had that same motivation. I say to myself everyday that I need to give it a break and those feelings are exacerbated when I get high. I think it gets to the point where smoking weed becomes more of a routine rather than a recreational thing and I‚Äôm finding it increasingly harder to even go a day without a smoke.

Anxiety,fp2t0fg,t1_fp2rwn3,1588267394.0,"I really appreciate the time taken to respond and it‚Äôs comforting most of all to see that you can relate to what I‚Äôm going through, via experience. I liked your statement about how it‚Äôs natural to feel fear in justifiable situations such as being alone in a dark jungle as you mentioned and it‚Äôs very odd to have those same emotions whilst laying safely in my own bed. I think the biggest problem trying to overcome this is that it changes from day to day. Tomorrow I could have a burst of motivation to help myself and make the changes necessary, like booking that appointment, making plans to see friends/family etc. But then the next day which could fall on that appointment date, or that family event I can feel zero motivation to even leave the house, let alone my bed. It seems to be the progress you make in one day can set you forward one or two steps, but one bad day can set you back 10-20 steps. It truly is an on going battle and unfortunately at the moment, I cannot see a light at the end of the tunnel but it‚Äôs responses such as yours that set me on the right path."
Anxiety,fp2gntd,t3_gamj34,1588261434.0,"It‚Äôs the worst part of the day for me. After having to force myself outside for the day for work purposes and then coming home to sit there and dwell on my life, I finally lay in bed and then the next four hours are just constant fear of everything. One of the strange things I can‚Äôt figure out is that one of the most frequent thoughts I encounter at night is an overwhelming fear of death, which contradicts my day time thoughts of life not worth living due to the crippling anxiety that prevents me from living it to it‚Äôs full potential. When I mentioned this to my doctor I was met with the classic devaluation of my condition by being told, ‚ÄúWell, I think it‚Äôs normal to be afraid of death, we are all afraid of it‚Äù. When it gets to the extent that you‚Äôre having barely 3 hours of sleep a night and you engage in panic attacks as a result and then it just gets brushed under the carpet by a medical professional is when you lose your faith of seeking medicinal help. 

Apologies if this is too dark or whatever, I‚Äôm new to this thread and thought maybe it might be comforting to find and discuss similarities, which in someways is more beneficial than seeking medical attention."

history,fp0i6gs,t3_ga7s8j,1588209760.0,"I read an interesting article a while back detailing how the front line worked in the trenches. Companies would have to spend 6 days a month on the front line and then they would rotate, interestingly film and tv has us believe there is just constant war with bombs and death everywhere and although that may well have been the case, several companies would sit on the front line and not fire a single round. This may have been the first war, I‚Äôm not entirely sure and am open to correction. 

My partners grandfather was a POW in Taiwan during ww2, although he never spoke of it and frequently had night terrors. The only info any of his family were able to get out of him is that one of the Taiwanese officers was called Kuan and as cliche as it sounds, bamboo sticks were actually used almost as a cross for crucifixion, which were then set alight. It‚Äôs important to mention that he was an alcoholic a majority of his life, probably as a result of the terror he suffered, so some of the info given may have been exacerbated."
