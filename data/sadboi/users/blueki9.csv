But my answer as a woman is 100 percent yes, they should be gentler because their are built differently/are naturally stronger. And you are not too weak for this sport.
They don't have ladies and men categories separate in competition for no reason.
But I don't complain either... So it does get hard sometimes."

By the way J* acted in the midst of dramagedon 2, I suspect there was some planning going on on the part of J* to bring JC down. But unexpected things happened or plans changed on the road so to speak. Just a theory. :)"

The cat person may know a lot, but who knows what the cat relly  feels. Why risk? I'm a cat person too, had one for 11 years and im pretty informed. Anyway, that's my opinion, my cat can't stand anything on her and she's been a stray for one whole year of her life also."
aww,exki4ot,t1_exkg12t,1566390227.0,"""There are several reasons why you shouldn‚Äôt invest in a collar with a bell.

The first reason for this is that it can interfere with your cat‚Äôs hunting skills. 

Cats, as we‚Äôve already mentioned, are natural hunters. They also need to be able to hunt for wild animals or prizes to keep their lifestyle active and healthy. The noise produced by the bell can make hunting impossible as the prey becomes more alert and aware of the cat‚Äôs presence.

Another reason is that the constant jingling can be quite stressful for your cats. These animals were designed for stealth and sneaky approach. Having a constant sound source can be pretty annoying not just for your cat, but also for you.

Ask yourself first. Can you really endure having a jingling bell sound all the time? Many cat owners are quick to the idea of buying a collar with a bell, only to regret hearing the sound as time goes on. You would need to consider this before going for a bell collar.

Stress can negatively affect your pet, especially if your cat has been experiencing it for quite some time. It can make your cat more prone to stress-related illnesses. See how your cat handles the bell and alternate between attaching the bell and removing it.

Collars can also present risks for your cats. These can get snagged in bushes and other things that can trap your pet.""

Humans that put bells on cats should try it themselves, see if you can live each day with an almost constant noise, then think again."

Just stop, okay?"

Remember how JS tried to make him scared saying all these people will come after you and calling him an f*ing predator, etc.

 Yet there is not one  true accusation against him, except the Ebola thing which people got over. 

Some serios f*ed up s**t is happening with the hate bandwagon towards JC.

Also what scares me is thst JS won't stop until JC is down, the envy in JS towards JC is scary."
