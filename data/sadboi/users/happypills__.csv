ptsd,fr35jox,t3_gmbhr0,1589850382.0,"I completely understand. I also have CPTSD, depression, anxiety, and probably ADD but that has not been fully determined. I raised myself and my brother because my mother is a narcissist. The second I turned 16 my mother made me go to work to pay the bills while her and her boyfriend at the time had no jobs. They tore me down every way they could, mainly the boyfriend, in order to mold me into the perfect codependent. I was controlled in every aspect and told that I had no privacy because I was a child. Even though my mother separated from her boyfriend when I went to college, she found another abusive boyfriend that was ten times worse and both she and him used my college loans. They guilted me into anything. They called me lazy when in reality my depression was so bad I could barely get up every morning to just live. I begged my mother to go to therapy, to mend herself and our relationship as well as me get the help I needed, but she always dismissed me.
The point is, my anxiety, depression, suicidal tendencies, and ADD were off the charts being around my mother. The second my mother abandoned my brother and I, my brain could finally begin to heal. My diagnoses are still there, but they are SO MUCH BETTER not being around constant abuse. My recommendation is, cut all ties with your mother. Speak only occassionally. That's the only way you'll be able to heal. And, if you can afford it, take a year off of school. Find hobbies you enjoy that aren't forced on you. Find a job that you'll actually want to study and do the rest of your life. Remember you are your own person and she can no longer have control over you."

But a part of me is nervous because I really need to start allowing myself to become vulnerable and feel the emotions I suppressed my whole life in order to survive the abuse. I know the emotions are extremely raw and intense. It took me two years for my brain to allow me to cry for more than 2 minutes and let out some of the pain and feel some of the emotions."

It's not fair that someone took advantage of us and our trust. It sucks and they are so, so wrong for it all. But, even though it sucks, we can't take any of it back. It happened and we can't change that. But what we can do is prove them wrong. We can become better people because of it, we can heal and become stronger, we can not let it tear us down and eat us up. I'm still in the process of healing and I have a lot of repressed emotions that I will need to process, but I'm getting better and I refuse to let their disgusting actions negatively impact my life and my future because that's what they want: to damage us.

The abuse happened, no fault to yourself, but it has left a permanent mark. The way to heal is accept what you cannot change, accept you did everything you could in that situation, that the person is at fault and was extremely wrong. You are a new version of yourself, a stronger version for having to endure what you did and healing from the trauma ‚ù§. Give yourself time because healing isn't always immediate."

All I ever knew was what I could have been if the abuse didn't happen. I accepted that I'm a clean slate now. Nothing in my past defines me, only I can define me and what I can do in the future. Of course I have times where I wish I weren't so triggered or have gotten so detached from socializing. I wish I could be extroverted and thrive off of socialization like I see many others do. Maybe with time I will. It's all apart of healing."

He is verbally abusing you and it sounds like at any moment it will escalate into physical abuse. It will NOT get better and it is NOT okay.

All I was allowed to do was work and give them all my money, take care of the house, my brothers, and clean. I was severely punished in some way if I even looked or alluding to having outside interests. When I was removed from the situation, I lost all of that along with all my personal belongings. There are no words to describe feeling like you don't even know who you are because everything you thought you were was a lie or just a survival technique your brain developed.

CPTSD,fknh7uq,t1_fkmglap,1584365688.0,"Are you really trying to argue about telling their children they're too much when all they want is your love and affection? He is a CHILD he doesn't understand unless the parent explains. I'm sure it's safe to assume she gave him all her attention so once she didn't the child did not understand and thought something was wrong. It is her job as the parent to explain that when ""mommy is on the phone, she can't always hold him or talk to him too because that's not nice to the other person on the phone"". It's called emotional regulation and teaching your child to grow into a human being. Regardless that specific circumstance does not, at all, fit in the category of someone's parent telling them they are ""too much"" for wanting basic human interactions.
*edit: I'm sorry I didn't see the child was LESS THAN A YEAR! Of course he didn't understand! Of course he wanted his mother's full attention! He is an infant! It would be completely different even at a year or older, then the mother would be able to explain, but an infant hasn't even yet to develop that capacity in their brain. I assume the child grew out of it once he was old enough and the mother explained?"
CPTSD,fkkh81u,t3_fj1efh,1584283945.0,"There is no such thing as a child needing ""too much"" love or attention. There is no such thing as giving a child ""too much"" love and attention. I minored in psychology of human development. It is physically impossible for a child to want, need, or receive too much attention and love.
