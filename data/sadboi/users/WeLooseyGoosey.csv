synthrecipes,fp1tkg7,t1_fp10dqa,1588247388.0,You're thinking of the song Eulogy. Went to a clinic with the band and they played that song which started out with Adam strumming I think the b and e strings behind the bridge. I was actually pretty excited to find that out since that was another sound I always wondered about.
synthesizers,focd97p,t3_g4owjf,1587669957.0,"I'm looking to get a beginner friendly synth under $500. My goal is to be able to create some dark/psychedelic/ambient soundscapes for playing a drop tuned distorted guitar over it with the volume rolled down. I'm planning on getting a looper pedal for my guitar and switching between the synth and guitar for some cool improvised jams. I have a Scarlett 2i2 interface that I'd like to use with the synth.

So I'm pretty sure it will need a sequencer to get some soundscape kind of stuff but I'm not sure if I can achieve the sound I want with a monophonic synth. I do have an Akai MPK Mini for keys but I hate how gummy the keys feel so I'd prefer to not use it.

From the research I've done I'm leaning towards a Korg Minilogue if I can find a good deal on it. I might just get the Monologue instead since it's more at the price I'd prefer to pay and still has a sequencer. I also really like the simplicity, sound, and the effects that come with the Yamaha Reface CS but it's lacking a sequencer.

Here are a few songs with synths I'm inspired by that I may want to try recreating if I can:

* [TOOL - Reflection](https://youtu.be/4MzVuHqsNoM?t=42) (I know the synth used for this song is an Access Virus A but a little too expensive for me)
* Any other TOOL song with a synth in it is pretty relevant for me
* [Led Zeppelin - No Quarter](https://youtu.be/wdqDmJbm2eY)
* [Karnivool - Aeons](https://youtu.be/2TKC3jW6fzk)
* [Porcupine Tree - Anesthetize](https://youtu.be/MSEQZ8reJA4?t=732)
* [Porcupine Tree - Arriving Somewhere But Not Here](https://youtu.be/WxIRFf-u_Bs)
* [The Contortionist - Return To Earth](https://youtu.be/yAfAxmhWmcQ)
* [ISIS - 20 Minutes / 40 Years](https://youtu.be/xS3NkhjsBf0?t=281)

Basically a lot of prog stuff though I do like other synth artists like Mac DeMarco, Tame Impala, Jon Hopkins, Tycho."
selfimprovement,fmq3944,t3_fwpj0g,1586292071.0,"Honestly I'm going to disagree with what the other person said. Overthinking and obsessing about the past is a one way ticket to anxiety and self hate which is the opposite of what we're here for on this sub. It's important to reflect and try and think of anything major you might have done but don't dwell on it. Learn and move on. Honestly if they're not communicating about it with you then there's a good chance they were the toxic ones. And also sometimes people are shitty and impulsive especially at a young age. Sometimes there really is no reason or the reason they have in their head is just some bullshit to make them feel better. But remember it's important to put your well-being first. Start looking for new people who appreciate you more, which I know is hard during this quarantine but do what you can. There's no need to please anyone except yourself as long as you aren't hurting others physically or emotionally."
mentalhealth,flgewem,t3_foo3ka,1585140808.0,"You're very lucky to have him, don't take it for granted. I wasn't so lucky, my ex of 3 years left when I was at one my lowest depressions of my life. I can't blame her because it was making me emotionally distant and I couldn't feel anything at all. But I was trying so hard to push through it and it wasn't enough.

I'm not trying to self pity here. I'm still working on having my depression completely managed even though it seems impossible. But there's 2 sides to the coin. Some people are willing to understand your mental illness which is awesome you found someone like this. And some people don't have the time or patience for it."

Rateme,fjknwic,t1_fjkg6qq,1583430458.0,I was thinking I'd make an update post on here once I have made some good progress and have some new pictures. Besides the glasses and hair I'm trying to workout more and make some adjustments to my wardrobe so it might be a month or two. I am in the states but there is a Marshalls in my state so I'll be sure to check there. Thanks for the product recommendations.
Rateme,fjkbqab,t1_fjjh1bi,1583424145.0,"Thank you, that was really kind of you. I am really self conscious about my looks and it effects my self esteem quite a bit. I feel better knowing that I'm not a total lost cause in the looks department. I'm going in for a new haircut today and I'm going to try and get some new glasses ordered as soon as I can. I'll see what I can find for a volume product. I've had some recommended at salons but they're a bit too expensive buying from there."
selfhelp,fjh7jc8,t3_fdfvqj,1583342748.0,"I think somewhere to start is to learn to validate yourself. From the sound of it you're seeking a lot of validation from others. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it's inconsistent and never seems to be there when you really need it. An easy place to start is self care, do you practice any self care habits? Exercise? Healthy diet? Reading? Meditation?

Also if you play piano have you tried sharing that talent with anyone? I know there are open mic nights at lots of places and if you found a place that has a piano you could go play a song. If performing in front of others is too stressful you could record your playing and share it on YouTube or SoundCloud. Even if it's just one person that listens it's something you can be grateful for that someone spent time to stop and listen.

You don't sound like a bad person from the way you're writing your post. You just need some value in your life and looking internally would be the best plan of action."
Rateme,fjdlmvu,t1_fjdanov,1583254942.0,"Oh I gotcha, I assumed a high 6 or low 8 was the minimum for being considered attractive. I'm definitely going to work on the style, I have plenty of button ups and chinos that I only wear for work. To be honest I've gotten more compliments from people when I wear my work clothes than my street clothes so I should have noticed that sooner.

Was the book called ""Models: Attract Women Through Honesty""? I've got that one on my list. But that's a good idea to think of a fake movie to get a specific reaction."
Rateme,fjc34i1,t1_fjc18g1,1583207395.0,"Second picture has a smile but as for the type of girl I'm interested in it would probably qualify as the progressive type. I've been told I should grow a beard as I do need to shave pretty frequently, could be daily but I do every 2-3 days. I don't think I'd like a full beard but letting it grow a bit in between shaves wouldn't be a bad idea. I'll look into hair medication though as long as I can afford that."
Rateme,fjbrp2k,t1_fjbc1f2,1583199947.0,"Well thanks for being honest, sucks to be a 4 but oh well it is what it is. Not even sure how I even got a girlfriend in the past to be honest. Yeah I have to figure out something with the hair, I don't have much to work with because it's pretty thin. Glasses I'm kind of stuck with since they're fairly new but I've had smaller thinner glasses in the past and they looked a lot worse so not really sure what to do there either. For workouts do you mean like bodyweight stuff? And yeah I can't fake smile or smirk or anything, I've practiced it but if I'm not in a good mood it never comes out right."

Rateme,fjbb0zg,t1_fjb2fv3,1583189636.0,"Definitely going to be going in for a haircut as soon as I can. As for the style, what if I'm looking for a person who also dresses grunge/alternative style? Pretty much the only reason I dress this way is to attract other people who dress similarly even though it hasn't been doing me any favors lately. But I do have some business casual outfits from working in an office that I could try and combine with my other clothes."
Rateme,fjauhl9,t1_fjar55o,1583180851.0,"I usually just go for haircuts of people in bands I listen to who have a similar hair type as I do. My hair is pretty thin so there's not a whole lot I can do with it. The one I've been going with is this guy's haircut  [https://imgur.com/Gdxy5zg](https://imgur.com/Gdxy5zg)

But if you have any other suggestions I'm open to ideas. Just not sure what else I can do. I've tried letting it grow out but it starts to look like a mop and I've done short too but it wasn't much better."
lonely,fixhpix,t1_fixe6c9,1582820584.0,"There are a ton of options for making your own path even in high school. For me I decided I wanted to play guitar when I was 14 and that's what I did. It was a decision I made completely independent of what anyone else thought or said and I still play it 11 years later. Some other options would be find a club you're interested in or a sport you like. And even besides those options there's art, writing, photography, etc. The important thing is to pick it because you want to and then turn it into your own path in life.

There's no harm done in asking. If she says no that's totally cool, you can still continue on having the same interactions you were having before. Eventually there will be someone who says yes but there's no rush as long as you're not waiting around for that person. The important thing is to not view it as you're trying to get a girlfriend out of it. My last ex we met and hit it off right away, I asked for her Snapchat and we started talking a lot and I just kept asking her to do stuff, just anything it really didn't really matter. We actually got to the point where we just picked our own anniversary because neither of us really knew when we actually became a couple it just sort of happened.

And for the texting thing she probably just doesn't realize you're interested in her. That's why asking her to do something outside of school interactions is important. And don't think about what she thinks about you, your concern should be what you think of her."
selfhelp,fixbpbk,t3_fadbz8,1582817144.0,"It might not be what you want to hear but remaining friends with her and living together is extremely toxic for not only you but her too. You guys can be friends in the future but as of now you need to focus on healing because the wound will not close in a situation like that. If it does then it might not have healed correctly and you could run into other issues down the road.

I was broken up with by someone who I thought I could have spent the rest of my life with. We weren't living together after she left me but I made the mistake of letting her keep her stuff at my house and being somewhat in contact with each other. Sparing the details, I came extremely close to ending my life.

lonely,fix64fh,t3_faate6,1582813571.0,"Why not start becoming the lone wolf hero character? In my opinion those are my favorite characters in whatever media. For example take Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher series. He's a total badass, all he needs is his horse Roach and slaying some monsters. Obviously we can't go out and be monster slayers but carving your own path not dependent on others is badass. It always makes for the coolest characters in stories.

P.S. The Saturday girl wants you to ask her out. Just ask if she wants to get coffee or see a movie or whatever. Even if she says no that doesn't mean you have to stop talking to her or liking her."
mentalhealth,fir5oqj,t3_f9e4qz,1582657878.0,"I've been hearing it pretty much everyday for years and years. Especially when times are tough. What I've learned so far is that it's really just the ego talking. The most straightforward way to deal with it is to just not give it any attention. Don't push it away and don't pull it in, just let the thought pass. If you struggle with this you can look into mindfulness. If you want this thought of hating yourself to be less common then look into positive self talk. But really it just comes down to the ego and understanding that it's not really you saying that to yourself."

My last ex I met at a local concert through a mutual friend. I really love music so concerts are my comfort zone and I have an easy time talking about whatever music related.

Maybe for this girl you like you could message her on social media asking if she wants to go to some public event? Just don't have any expectations. If she says no then let it be, it's not a big deal."

I'd definitely recommend trying to find something that gets you excited and focus on that. Could be something small like a trip or something big like a skill you want to learn. Your confidence should naturally come back to you. Definitely embrace being single, there's so much more value in it than society leads us to believe."

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/d340g7/the_most_comprehensive_guide_to_dealing_with/) was a huge help for me. I'm not necessarily following all those steps but quite a few.

I also have low self esteem, anxiety, depression, the works. So I'm trying to practice self love and accepting that I don't need to date or be in a relationship. I think the biggest turning point for me was that nothing is stopping me from doing the things I liked to do in the relationship besides physical affection and intimacy. I can still go to the places I loved going with her and keep experiencing new things like I did before. So I booked a 4 day trip out to California and I'm beyond excited for that even though I'll be doing it alone. It's giving me a ton of confidence and realizing I don't need anyone but myself."

You have gained new values and understand what's important to you and what isn't. Eventually you'll get to share those things with someone else and they'll share theirs with you.

I know it sounds impossible but I do recommend you try no contact at least for 1-2 months if not longer. It may seem harmless but casual conversation is just leaving the wound open longer. Just let her know you need some space so that you can work on healing."
