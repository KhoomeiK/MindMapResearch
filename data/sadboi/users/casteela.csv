(Spoilers beyond) Before reading this thread, I thought that Rosa entering the society was a revenge plot by the father. He learned about the society from the mother, who used to be a part of it and formerly engaged to Maurits. The society wanted so badly to recruit Rosa because she was the daughter of the mother and the new man. But, it backfired on the Ares society as Rosa became the new president.

Finding someone who aligns with you and your values such as being childfree is important but can come much easier than you think once you invest time in yourself again.

Case in point: my recruiter and me. I have been active for over four years at one temp agency. I answer when she calls and I respond yes or no to her offers (most of the time it is a yes). Because I have built a good rapport with the employers that I've worked with and I am highly responsive, she keeps calling me with better, higher-paying positions. Now she calls me her go-to person.
