millionairemakers,fqtlvo7,t3_gkjiqo,1589641531.0,"I work in the Medical Marijuana industry. I truly care about helping others and see how many people are benefiting from cannabis on a daily basis. I am doing my best to start my own company, as I feel as though the patients in my state are being unfairly treated with their price-gouged medicine. It is unaffordable, over double the cost of street prices. In some cases triple. 

Interestingly, with Covid, our sales have skyrocketed. We made the most money we ever have in a single day yesterday. Yet, they have slimmed down our staff, cut our hours, and added about twice the amount of responsibility for workers (curbside pickup, internet orders, etc.) The icing on the cake, though, is that they took away our hazard pay (2 more dollars an hour), even though our state is still in lockdown. 

I understand life is not fair. And I do not believe in complaining my life away. I need to take a long break, and then start being the change I want to see in the world by taking matters into my own hands. I just need some funds. Thank you! Much love."
Fantasy,foqvvxe,t3_g90ggb,1588001755.0,"The Last Wish - first short story collection of The Witcher. About 400 pages, unconnected to the main plot, and an introduction to Geralt and his monster hunting profession. I never played the games and only watched one episode of the show, but I think it's a damn good read."
