Also the fact that he has clients, he's not working for a conservation museum. So his goals are quite a bit different as a private restorer and would absolutely appear aggressive to people who are into museum conservation. I'm guessing OP of that comment is just salty about it. I'm sure there are people out there like OP who believe private restoration is inherently shittier since it puts the clients wishes over conserving the art. (Though they wouldn't admit that's the reason)

If you're into art conservation, you might have a superiority complex about how much better you 'protect the original' (by working on it for 7 months and being minimally invasive) compared to a restorer who needs to please a client's wishes and protect the art as best they can without spending too much time on it.

That said, it's not impossible for him to learn to manage the behaviours and find solutions that work for him. What often happens is often a lack of routine/structure plus forgetfulness equals mess. Our brains are wired to only think or care about the next thing we want to do (stimulation)and cleaning isn't part of that equation because it's not stimulating. Not having stimulation is dreadful to an ADHDer so we avoid boring things like the plague. 

The goals is to endure something boring until it becomes an automatic behaviour but it requires active throughtfulness, self reminders and time. Bribery, anger, and feeling forced into it will make us withdraw more. 

That said, you shouldn't have to put up with your roommates behaviour. You didn't sign up to be his life coach or therapist or whatever else. He should be living with people who are more comfortable with filth (might actually make him want to clean if it's not being done for him lol) and he should be on his meds, and not a heavy weed user. Weed makes my ADHD so much worse honestly especially regarding my memory. 

And he should be getting help. I had to go out and get my ass diagnosed and put on meds. I don't want to subject other people to the weight of my issues and being on my own has been good for me.

TwoXChromosomes,fkcddmr,t3_fhctlr,1584050718.0,"If you know anything about Japanese society and women, none of this is very shocking. Only very recently has their laws regarding rape started to change. They still strongly believe rape only occurs when the victim fights back physically. Sexual assault outside of penetrative rape is ignored completely in the law. If you've ever seen Japanese pornography, non-consent theme is expected and more normal than consent themes. This isn't just a taboo fantasy, it's a very real reflection of Japanese society and what is deemed acceptable. 

Japan has low rape and sexual assault rates for a reason and it's not because rape and sexual assault don't happen. It's because it's far more acceptable and the definition is far more narrow than it is in other countries. 

Let's not also forgot that reporting rape in Japan if you even meet the criteria will mean a whole other uphill battle.  You have to prove you were raped beyond doubt and prove you faught back. You are subjected to being retraumatized where police officers will make you reinact what happened like a play. Its a completely humiliating process and I'm sure many rapes go unreported for that reason. 

They do everything in their power to make you feel like you wanted it to happen. 

Being groped on public transport is such a huge issue that they had to make some trains specifically for women only. Sekuhara (sexual harassment) is treated like a joke. A lot of women think they aren't supposed to enjoy sex like it's some awkward painful thing where you are supposed to just lay there and be used essentially. You'll looked at sideways for even admitting as a woman that you masturbate or enjoy sex. It's just very taboo and sexually repressive. 

And that's not even covering the fact that Japan only outlawed CP in the 90's and only outlawed possession of CP a few years ago. And that child sex trafficking in Japan is still a huge problem that the country turns a blind eye to. That you can still go to any adult store and buy porn comics depicting children, toddlers and babies. 

In Japan, the cuter and more child-like you are, the more attractive you become in their society. 

Japan uses manga and anime to make them more likeable to the rest of the world but a lot of their social conventions leak through that material. You learn pretty quickly that girls aged 14-17 are seen as the peak of attractiveness and after that age women get less desirable or ""old"". 

It's all interconnected and results in a father raping his daughter repeatedly, walking free then only getting 10 years. Also throw out any fantasies about him being treated poorly in prison. I seriously doubt the inmates would care."

AskReddit,fiuq3t1,t1_fitpcrn,1582746157.0,">Its te stigma and the concern more than the actual act that fucks people up.

I agree. People are often made to feel shame when they insist they're fine. However, people are also often dismissed when they are struggling to cope with something that happened to them as well. Both of these things are bad. 

>Kids are forced to do and learn things all the time from adults and people in positions of power, often when they dont want to.

This is true but a lot of that is simply learning how to function in our society and it's not usually done behind closed doors. Intimacy/relationships are highly individualized and personal and quite private. Just not the same. 

>yet people seem to think that kids learning sex from adults, even in a consensual relationship, means they're going to be fucked up from it. 

It's true that a lot of people think that a minor and an adult having sex means the minor will be traumatized. It's not true. However, that doesn't mean the adult wasn't being abusive. 

>But discussions about what really causes harm in underaged children when they engage in sexual activity with adults basically always end up with people asking for more analysis being accused of being pedophiles.

Yes it's sad that we can't have open conversations about it without people accusing you of being a pedo or a pedo sympathiser. In my opinion, because of the nature of how impressionable minors are, it's just very risky morally speaking. For the minor, that kind of relationship can fundamentally change how you view relationships and what is healthy vs what isn't. There's also this common thing that happens in these relationships where the adult will abandon the minor when the minor outgrows the age of sexual interest the adult has. This can be extremely distressing for the minor. It's less about the actual act of sex (because let's be real, teens have sex with each other all the time and no one bats an eyelash) an more about the manipulation, grooming, power dynamic, fetishism etc the adult would have. There's just too many factors that raise the likely hood of abuse and trauma.

This isn't just about minors and adults however. You can see the same patterns in adult relationships where one person is a young adult and the other is middle aged or more. It's still considered a power dynamic that can more likely result in abuse although it's not technically illegal at that point."

I don't think it's accurate to say these people cheapen what it means to be queer, they simply live in a different social enviornment than the rest of us. Had they never reached fame, they would most likely consider themselves, bi, gay, lesbian, pan etc like the rest of us. The fact that coming out is often used as a distraction by a celebrity is for this very reason. Coming out as something specific instead of being wishy washy is big news and does make a good decoy story to society.

If it was so extremely prevalent it would be everywhere. I absolutely have the audacity to say most people with BPD will not physically hurt anyone but themselves. Because it's a statistical fact. They they more likely to get physical than the general pop. Sure. Anyone with a disorder that effects emotional regulation is. 

Also, I am not at all confident that BPD is not used as a blanket diagnosis in women with all cluster B personality disorders or other disorders that cause emotional dysregulation. It's literally one of the most misunderstood disorders, even by professionals. Mostly due to the still prevalent attitude about women and ""hysteria"". BPD is essentially the new hysteria. Anyone 'crazy' gets slapped with the borderline labels. NPD/ASPD are considered mens disorders. BPD is the woman's disorder. Even though there is no logical psychological reason one would affect one sex more than the other. That's just my armchair theory however.

Amber might as we'll have recited the narcissistic prayer. There is a thick layer of extreme denial/deflection/justification with narcissists that just does not really exist in borderlines. There is a reason narcissistic abuse has its own wiki page. 

 I'm not here to argue about your personal life. Obviously you feel what you do and if there was any indication of your personal life being referenced in your original post, I would have ignored it and replied to someone else. 0 point in arguing with the traumatized but I'll leave it for the lurkers.

videos,fgjsik7,t1_fgjmtlc,1580850532.0,"I said people with borderline are far more likely to hurt themselves than hurt others. Your study does not refute that fact. It still holds true. 

The link between BPD and externalized violence actually not well documented _at all_ outside of anecdotes. The problem with anecdotes is they are more indicative of a coincidence/odd outlier(like misdiagnosis) than a correlation. PwBPD aren't incapable of abusing others. Literally never said that. _Almost no one on earth is incapable of abusing others._ 

However all major, large scale studies point to self directed harm as the key aspect of the disorder. This correlates with the core nature of BPD. 

I find it interesting how you say this is somehow victimizing pwBPD. It's simply the facts. Your conclusions are being highly influenced by your own personal anecdotes. Unlike NPD and ASPD which are highly difficult to treat given their nature, BPD is very treatable with DBT/psychotherapy.

The only time I believe pwBPD are more physically abusive is maybe compared to the general population. But you can say that about disorders in general like Autism, ADHD, Schizophrenia, Bipolar etc."

I don't know why anyone would think BPD before NPD/ASPD when the individual is particularly violent and cruel to other people. After listening to the full recording, it becomes clear that she is way too manipulative/calculating to be BPD or primarily BPD. Her consistent lying is evident of that. 

The only thing that makes me think BPD is her clinging to the relationship. But narcissists do this as well because they feel they are entitled to their lovers (and other important people in their lives) who they treat as objects to use for their own gain.

TooAfraidToAsk,ff5mu6q,t1_ff50yul,1579600788.0,"That's an interesting question. I'll try and answer it from my perspective. Being lgbt can bring about a lot of anxiety since when you live in a world where bigots are a real threat. This means usually that everyone becomes a danger until proven otherwise. Even though I'm not an overly anxious person, even I find myself wondering if something someone said was bigoted or not even if its far more likely that it wasn't. I just don't trust the intention of others since I've been exposed to bigotry.

There is something very deep and emotionally traumatic about it all. It's not just politics to us, it's our livelihoods. A lot of people simply don't know how to cope with any criticism so they would rather assume the worse than let themselves be vulnerable, especially with people they don't know well. Because of this anxious preoccupation with perceived threats, we often take a false dive into picking up on tone, body language, words used etc to protect ourselves from bigotry/bigots. 

TLDR; emotional trauma makes people anxious and this means a potential trigger at any perceived slight. So, defense mechanism. 

As a side note, there is a very small but vocal minority who will use this fact to their advantage in a manipulative way. Often they will never take the blame for something and accuse others of being whatever phobic even if it has nothing to do with their identity. Narcissists come to mind, but its not just limited to that kind of shitty person.  I wish lgbt people were all sweet people but we have the same amount of idiots as any other group.

That's different from implying I'm shoving it in people's faces. I want to talk about the people I love and I want to talk about my life the way anyone else does. I want to exist without hate being directed toward me for things directly tied to my gender and sexuality. 

There's just a big difference between not caring because you already respect and understand lgbt people and then there's not caring because you don't want to be exposed to it because it makes you uncomfortable/weirded out.

Sure they could have added more information but you can only cram so much nuance into such short episodes and I think they did surprisingly well given the allotment of time they had.

Showerthoughts,fbugm2c,t1_fbtk229,1577114053.0,"It's nice to see so many fellow migraine sufferers share their experiences. I've had migraines since I was a toddler. Really freaked my mother out since the first time I got one and wouldn't stop screaming. She had to take me to the hospital where they informed her I was having a migraine. It runs in my family as my sisters get them too but I've had them with greater frequency.

Growing up, if it was really bright out or I was playing too much in a noisy space, it would trigger one. Mom knew to put me in a dark room with no sound, put the fan on me, give me an advil, put a bucket beside me incase I puked (almost always did when I was a kid) and let me sleep. 

I remember screaming and crying, then barfing, then sleeping. Waking up feeling so relieved and wanting to go outside and play again lol. I got them after school trips to the movies, during loud school dances, etc. I had to be sent home a few times from school due to them. Sometimes the school would just let me sleep it off in the nurse room as well. 

As I got older, I got better at avoiding my triggers and knowing when one was gunna strike. I also never experiences an aura with these. They just started out as a slight headache and got worse if I didn't pop an advil or lie the fuck down to sleep it off. 

Into my adulthood I started getting infrequent cluster headaches especially upon waking from sleep. I'd wake up crying and in agony. Ive been salty about it since I put so much work into avoiding my migraines and these stupid cluster headaches sneak attack me in my sleep? Wtf man. Anyway, it's like waking up to a full blown migraine. Just brutal. I haven't had one in a while but it's only a matter of time. 

I also once had a brainstem migraine a few years ago. Scared the shit out of me. I got very tired in the evening suddenly and went to go the a nap. Woke up and went to the bathroom. While on the toilet I was wondering why the hell I still felt like I was dreaming or that I had just awoken from a coma. I go out and talk to my now ex but I can't speak? Like the words just aren't forming and I'm stuttering. She tests me to make sure I'm not having a stroke. To make it worse, it was the middle of night, neither of us drive and were 40 min away from the nearest hospital. Anyway, it was a solid hour and a half of me crying and stuttering my ass off. It went away completely after about 2 hours. Got driven to the hospital the next day just to be safe.

Apparently, these types of migrains mimic strokes and can be extremely painful. I'm sooooo happy it wasn't painful at all. Just scary. I now know what it feels like to have an uncontrollable stutter! It's like being trapped in your head really. Not fun I tell you. 

I often don't think about it much, my migraines. It's just always been a normal part of my life that I simply deal with. I've had them since before my earliest memories. But I really cannot stand people who don't take them seriously or compare them to just a headache. They're truely dibilitating if they aren't delt with swiftly.

Edit: Pretty sure having used advil as frequently as I did, and how much I puked growing up gave me GERD and bad acid reflux. That's also been an issue since I was a kid. Feelsbad"

unpopularopinion,f90v9rv,t1_f8zf0q7,1574977821.0,"This is the right answer. I find a lot of guy humour cringy and simply unfunny. To the point of where I thought I disliked comedy as a whole (since guy comedy often dominates those genres) Not because it's objectively so, but because I simply don't relate to those experiences. Obviously there are lots of comedians who make humour that relates to all people but a lot of the time it can be quite gendered. 

Then I saw 21 and 22 jumpstreet which is humour that pokes fun of masculinity and I found that hilarious. I also discovered the Baroness Von Sketch show which I find to be the funniest thing I've ever watched in my life but came to realize a lot of people hate it simply because it's women centric and lgbt humour. 

It's simply much more relatable and therefore funny."
television,f8o7hza,t3_e13b14,1574666150.0,"For real. This show is a literal masterpiece. I've never seen anything like it. Gave me goosebumps all the way through. 

I do have to admit that it can be hard to follow but rewatching it makes it all the better. I had to rewatch the first season before I watched the second season. I'll probably have to rewatch it all again once season 3 drops. 

The amount of planning that goes into something like this show must be huge. But oh man is it ever a rewarding thing experience."
pics,f85opya,t1_f85bu51,1574279756.0,"No, they were blaming the artist for karma farming by putting her face in the image. Which was shown to be sexist and hypocritical by other commenters linking to various posts with men beside their art where the same sentiment wasn't shared. 

If what you said is true, they would have criticized the people upvoting. But the men of reddit would rather hold women accountable even though it's other men who are upvoting because she's attractive. 

It's the age old tale of men being bitter at women who receive attention because of their appearance when it's other men who y'all should be blaming.

Call people out for lusting over someone (who's literally just a person sitting there) rather than appreciating their talent and work."
canada,f7kvbdp,t1_f7jsxqp,1573826903.0,"I agree with this. I have ADHD and have suffered poor oral care dispite my parents instilling in me early on to always brush. I've had multiple cavities filled as a teenager and even had to have a root canal when I was 17. 

All of that was covered because I was a minor at the time though. Oral health is super important when it comes to cavities and the like but I also think othodontics/braces are just as important. I've been crazy depressed about my overbite and crooked smile because of how it affects my overall appearance. Which makes me not want to take care of my oral health as much. 

It all just effects each other and spirals. I hate that I'd have to pay 5000 for ""cosmetic"" reasons when this aspect has been a detriment to my mental health. I can't afford it."
books,f7jf0ib,t1_f7hedo3,1573776217.0,"Can confirm. With the exception of the hunger games series which I read in one weekend once because I was so captivated by it. 

A lot of it has to do with the shortest path to maximum enjoyment. Reading takes a little more effort than watching a show or a movie with a similar happiness outcome. So, I almost always prefer the movie/show. The reason I started in on the hunger games was because I was on a very long road trip and had no other material. So, I got sucked in since reading is more enjoyment than sitting and listening to the radio. 

Once the roadtrip was over, I had to know how the story ended. 

That's how my ADHD works for me anyway.

Edit: Just to add, I used to read a lot of fanfiction growing up since I was already familiar with the universes. Now a days, it's mostly articles/short informational text."
worldnews,f7it5by,t1_f7hw8o5,1573765130.0,"Completely different experience where I am in Canada right now. 

I live in BC and started HRT this year after 3 appointments (about 2 months) with my GP where I signed an informed consent form, got a blood test and went over a pretty basic checklist. They hooked me up with Trans Care BC which is a relatively new program here that kind of acts as a special 3rd party that helps GPs navigate and provide trans healthcare locally 

Just a few years ago a gender dysphoria diagnosis was required as well as greenlights from 2 seperate psychiatrists but that is no longer the case. They require you to have had seen a psychiatrist in the last six months but just for general mental health/making sure you don't have a psychiatric disorder that might be causing you to want to start HRT outside of gender identity. 

Trans Care BC also booked me into a surgical readiness assessment for top surgery. Even though it's new, it works quite well to have a support hub. Hopefully other provinces can follow suit create something similar to help trans healthcare be more accessible."
mypartneristrans,f7h7v1g,t3_dw0we2,1573734556.0,"I mean, if you end up doing it alone in person, I'd be very surprised. Go for it if you think you can handle any of the things you're worrying about.

However, there are other ways you can break the ice in my opinion: writing a letter, making a video for her to watch, with a neutral 3rd party etc. In a way where your partner can be involved directly with speaking but not directly in mom's line of fire if it came to that."

mypartneristrans,f7h6sez,t3_dvyc9w,1573733744.0,"Hey, nonbinary transmasc person here. Forget about labels for a moment and think about wether or not you are still romantically interested in/sexually attracted to your partner. If the answer is no, then you need to find a way to accept the fact that an intimate relationship isn't going to work at this point in time. You can still support her but you don't need to force yourself into a situation you aren't comfortable with to do that. 

On a side not, because your lack of attraction to women seems to be centered around a personal trauma inflicted by a sole individual, I would also recommend you seek therapy. For your own quality of life. And maybe for a better chance of stability in the future."

EternalCardGame,f4c7i2k,t1_f49v9gn,1571525319.0,"I couldn't get the full decklist as I didn't have enough shiftstone but I got about 90% of it and it's quite good! I added Siraf's Beacon to the market and also some Marshall Ironthorns for something to lean on in longer games. But yeah!! It's a decent deck. So far I've lost only to Onis and shooty heavy primal decks.

I'll keep using it and update you on my standing."

Often I'll take a lot of damage at the beginning, clear the board, and have some bigger units saved in my hand. I tend to recover better than my opponent unless they know I was going to nuke. But most times works in my favor.

Once I pop Unity on one of my bigger units, my lack of health becomes less of an issue. I do get boned if my units cannot stick afterwards tho. It's a bit clutch"

EternalCardGame,f43gsa6,t1_f41oid6,1571341747.0,This makes a lot of sense! I'd be very interested in building toward a more aggro oriented deck. I do feel like I've been trying to compromise a lot and it's left my deck a bit grindy. Much appreciated.
EternalCardGame,f40bu98,t1_f408ajq,1571292719.0,"Thanks for the advice! I can see what you mean. Chains is actually not my focus of this deck anymore tho. I don't feel like it's very viable without shadow cards to control the field while ramping. If someone figured out a way to make it work well, I'd be interested in their decklist. 

I'll try and give a general breakdown of how I play these units:

Hojan: If he's lucky enough to stick, I like the early lifesteal that comes with empower. As well as the effect of getting a sigil from using Finest Hour or a Gilded Glaive. 

Resolute Monk: I've been back and fourth with this card a lot but ultimately he makes a good distraction and if I'm lucky, early 5 damage can go a long way.

Voice of the Speaker: Good if I get a bad starting hand with few sigils. Also combos with Talir's. Which then combos with all my empower cards. Also makes good control fodder.

Smuggler: Market + Control Fodder. 

Unraveling Fanatic: This deck sometimes has issues keeping a hand so this one really helps with its card draw. Plus it's like a ticking time bomb which makes the opponent anxious. 

Sandstorm Titan: Just something midrange and strong to help with flying units. 

Marshall: Kind of a jack of all trades. I try not to play him unless I have a sigil ready to pop with him. Def a unit I use mostly to combo. 

Worldbearer: Needed something big I could play and use without combos. But also extremely useful if I can combo attack with him. 

Mystic Ascendant: This guy is the bread and butter of my deck. I'd use 6 of these if I could. He combos very well with almost all my other cards. Usually my goal is to protect him with the Spellcraft on Sword of Unity and get his +2/+2 going. Eventually he gets huge and I can do whatever combos I want since I'll have lots of cards in hand. I haven't seen many people who have decks centered around this guy but I think he's awesome. Card draw and his perma buff make him a real force."
HSVpositive,f3vj8nj,t3_dhssh9,1571177300.0,"So, about a year ago I felt a tingling on the corner of my lip after being extremely stressed out.

I keep reading about the healing process but the area never ""bursts and oozes"" it just tingles, gets a little pink and raised, then goes away. Almost like a pimple. 

Not sure what to make of it. I'm always really carful not to touch it and stuff because my mom suffers them  at times and I've seen her agony about the itching and spreading. How common is my experience with them?"
