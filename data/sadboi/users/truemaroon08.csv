It’s here and to think it isn’t and won’t ever be here is some bizarre form of hubris from the ‘murica crowd. I firmly believe the bottom is still coming.

You can overcome it! What I’ve found helps me is to question my anxious thoughts. Provide facts to myself that are contrary to the thoughts I’m having.

Even when they get pushed and prodded they don’t resort to personal attacks. They may show a little anger and incredulity at the arguments, but I can’t remember any shouting.

It would be one thing if his office engaged a concerned voter with “I understand your position, but we just aren’t hearing that from other constituents in our district.” Instead, I get “the congressman doesn’t think the president has done anything wrong and that this is a partisan impeachment process that hasn’t uncovered any evidence to support the claim.”
