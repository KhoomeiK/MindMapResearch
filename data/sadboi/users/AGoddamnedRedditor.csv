Some manufacturers do state 15 max. Petzl specifically states 10 though, and I'd argue they're a pretty darn reliable source.

Also, in regards to damage prior to that time period, most manufacturers have an internal stitch in their gear that's a different coloured thread than what's visibly used on that product. If you see that thread, it's 100% time to retire the soft good."

This paper doesn't necessarily address the AEC over exposing, but it does conclude that surface dose is only reduced by 4%, but internal dose increases due to backscatter anyways. So basically saying the dose to the patient may decrease when lead is used, but if it does, that decrease is negligible anyways."
