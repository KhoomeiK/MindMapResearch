AEWOfficial,fqy9g39,t1_fqy4esv,1589744905.0,"I think both Hangman and Nick should be back.  No Cody in this one since he has his match against Archer.  So it should be Bucks +Hangman + Omega+ Hardy I think(or rather hope).

Hangman, if he is in it, should ride his horse onto the field in a triumphant return."
Tucson,fqrlarj,t3_gkjy2q,1589586657.0,I don't think Trader Joes requires them but when I've gone 95% of people have them on(all employees do) and they are limiting the amount of people in the store at one time.  You may have to wait outside but it at least feels like they have their shit together.
AEWOfficial,fqlxh3d,t3_gjlz51,1589467853.0,"Yeah as soon as Fenix was added I knew this is going to be amazing.  Colt seems a little odd for this but I can see him as kinda the old vet who keeps everything moving the way its supposed to in the ring.  

I was thinking Sammy would be in this too but I guess not now with the Stadium Fight between IC and the Elite happening."
AEWOfficial,fq42z7v,t3_ggrkmy,1589073075.0,She's really good on twitter.
AEWOfficial,fppksd1,t3_geqrx3,1588804113.0,Looks cool as hell.  I like you using the Dynamite color scheme.  Man when they finally just show a teaser of the game I'm going to lose my mind.  Im so ready.
Tucson,fpkjehg,t1_fpkfzk6,1588695751.0,It 100% does need to be.  Its just they should have done this 20-30 years ago like every other road project in this town.
AEWOfficial,fphmj94,t3_gdidly,1588623910.0,"As someone who was out of wrestling for a long time before AEW started I had no idea who he was the first time I saw him but he's become one of my favorites. 

There is a short documentary on him on Youtube called ""Please don't die Joey Janela"" that was a really good watch about his indie career (and the time he took a horrible bump off a roof).  Highly recommended."
giantbomb,fpgi5ij,t3_gdcdzo,1588603181.0,This is dope.  Love the purple.
AEWOfficial,fpdekdt,t3_gckiyw,1588525450.0,Not a fan of this.  I understand he is probably chomping at the bit to get back but man this is just a bad idea.
Tucson,fpa9ojw,t3_gcaunl,1588443649.0,"The lack of real statewide testing is giving us a very, very incomplete look at what is really happening.   Lots of deaths aren't even being counted and there are way more cases of Covid19 than have been registered

So, basically these numbers mean shit."
AEWOfficial,fp3ef0k,t3_gb31a6,1588277863.0,I like him but yeah that knee looked rough.  Hopfully Musa was just really selling it but that hurt my jaw just watching it.  :lol

AEWOfficial,fonmrdx,t1_fomsr6h,1587922471.0,Darby and Sammy probably threw that memo in the trash.  Those dudes are still doing crazy spots.  Even I want them to take it easier.  lol
AEWOfficial,fo7t5sg,t3_g653z5,1587584109.0,Ive been watching a lot of Beyond Wrestling on IWTV during this time and Ive really enjoyed it.  A lot of familiar faces from AEW too.

AEWOfficial,fmwuxlq,t3_fxs2wg,1586453479.0,I was thinking the same thing.  Ive never liked the Cross Rhodes as a finisher anyway so Im all for him moving away from it.

AEWOfficial,fmneoo1,t1_fmndznx,1586224356.0,Yep torn bicep I think.  Gonna be a while before he debuts.
AEWOfficial,fmj0rc0,t3_fvl1k4,1586120724.0,Ive been thinking about signing up for a trial just to see that Taker/Styles match.  Its weirdness sounds right up my alley.
AEWOfficial,fm4e7by,t1_fm46bux,1585752372.0,Well thats rude.  Guess we all can't be as ripped as you.
AEWOfficial,flxqtx4,t3_frujl5,1585588091.0,"Makes sense as they obviously have a limited talent pool to work with right now.  Give them a little fued and let Mox work his way through the inner circle (which right now is just Hager, Jerricho and Sammy as P&P are stuck in NYC for a while).  

I haven't been impressed by Hager as a wrestler but it makes since to push him a little right now just due to the surrounding circumstances."
brooklynninenine,fll5wgw,t3_fpg8q4,1585254208.0,Holy hell friend that is amazing!
brooklynninenine,flaka78,t3_fnjjrd,1584985548.0,I understand Jake arresting them hes a cop but Doug Judy did his friends freaking dirty and basically set them up so they couldn't go to this wedding.....messed up man.
AEWOfficial,fl1a889,t3_flyn4x,1584725021.0,Thats a good shirt.
AEWOfficial,fky6gmj,t3_fl3tcl,1584642539.0,Him and MJF freaking stole the show last night just being in the audience.  Amazing stuff.
AEWOfficial,fkvyq5v,t1_fkum9zb,1584579581.0,Haha well look at that just got to use the code Dynamite today!
AEWOfficial,fkvrupn,t1_fkvd6hs,1584575410.0,"Avalon is really great.  He really makes his gimmick work which is amazing when you think about it.  He also low key has one of the best shirts in the company.  

I also really like Cabana.  Maybe its this odd time we are in but his smiling, good-guy, superhero work is almost comforting.  :lol"
AEWOfficial,fkuh8rx,t3_fkr83c,1584549387.0,They often have 20% off sales(they just had one around the time of Revolution).  Twitter is where all that stuff gets announced usually.  It basically pays for shipping on a shirt which is nice.  I wouldn't be surprised if they have another sale like soon especially to maybe help out all the indie wrestlers who are currently out of work.
AEWOfficial,fk5mbnf,t3_fgm231,1583883445.0,Abadon seems great.  Love the look and she seems pretty good in the ring.  Could really use her on the main roster.
brooklynninenine,fk2h4ah,t3_fg4t3u,1583800931.0,Ha I always think about that when I watch that episode.
AEWOfficial,fjkmmfr,t3_fdxe3i,1583429752.0,More petty bulshit that does nothing but hurt their own talent.  Just dumb.
AEWOfficial,fjk777s,t1_fjk56w1,1583421548.0,Jake and Brodie together would be wonderful!

Its not available in the US since we are supposed to watch it on TNT but use a free VPN, set it to the UK and you will be good to go.   Its how a lot of us seem to watch it here. Its also commercial free so you get to see everything and you get a fun occasional hot mike from the announcing crew (JR was quite excited when the ring girls made their way out for the weigh in  :lol)."
AEWOfficial,fja0b52,t3_fcczvv,1583163665.0,I would so buy one (or 20).
AEWOfficial,fj0rhqk,t3_fawy3c,1582906248.0,Yeah Cornette has a history of racism and just being a shitty person in general.   Hes just a shitty dude.

Also, how freaking happy does Tony seem?  Dude is living his best life right now and I love it."
AEWOfficial,fiyjnhk,t1_fivkdj9,1582840692.0,I use NordVPN which has been great.  I had it prior to signing up to AEW Plus though.  There should be some free VPN addons you can get for Firefox and Opera and those should work just set it to a UK server.  I like having the real paid VPN as I have a license I  put on my phone since with the [Fite.tv](https://Fite.tv) app you can throw to a Roku so I can watch everything on my TV.
AEWOfficial,fiy7gp7,t1_fiw7swi,1582834021.0,Its such a small thing but its one of those little detail things that just help to make the whole show.
AEWOfficial,fiy79c9,t3_fahgqb,1582833907.0,They definitely did.   Makes it a little more interesting for Saturday as there are multiple ways for the match to go.  They've really booked this whole angle incredibly well.
AEWOfficial,fiy71qe,t3_fagug8,1582833788.0,Thats very good to hear.
AEWOfficial,fixy4y8,t3_faa3ll,1582828723.0,JR freaking losing it on the broadcast was great.  NOT THE DAMN DIPPING DOTS!  I was dying.

AEWOfficial,fiaoskz,t3_f78ggd,1582305444.0,I don't understand how someone could be so petty.  Don't you want your talent out there promoting your product?  Keeping them off every podcast of whatever that has AEW stars on it just seems like its hurting their own talent and not AEW.
AEWOfficial,fi7fysf,t3_f6nlov,1582220647.0,I love this stuff.
AEWOfficial,fhi62up,t1_fhi38al,1581618444.0,HAHA nope not me.
AEWOfficial,fhi0wvq,t3_f333jc,1581615633.0,It was badass I know that.  Im looking forward to seeing him work in the ring against cody.  I'm ready for these big boys to start really throwing their weight around.  Except Hager.  Fuck that guy.
AEWOfficial,fhi0hl8,t3_f3ccvl,1581615392.0,Santana & Ortiz  for sure.  Also sammy like you said.  Those guys are almost too likeable even as heels!
AEWOfficial,fhi08k3,t1_fhgp3fn,1581615249.0,He is the OFFICIAL AEW Jesus.  :0
AEWOfficial,fhhj0re,t3_f33a6g,1581605315.0,It was amazing.  Start to finish it was hot as hell!
AEWOfficial,fhekztg,t1_fhegcqg,1581524612.0,Yup.  His promo last night was great.  I also like him working more submissions into his match with Sonny. I think that works with his gimmick (just causing pain to people).
Tucson,fhbc34v,t3_f2a824,1581439203.0,Oh great what a wonderful use of the police!  What a joke.
AEWOfficial,fhbbz6y,t3_f29oza,1581439139.0,I think Cody losing would be good for the build and like you I don't think its a great idea to have Wardlow lose his first ever match. I think some sort of MJF interference is probably how it ends.
AEWOfficial,fh8ymax,t3_f1x1j4,1581370051.0,Good stuff.  Thanks for the write up!

Tucson,fel0ssd,t1_fekrk10,1579211612.0,Yikes.
AEWOfficial,fel0mp5,t3_epq3p3,1579211512.0,Im curious what NXT was doing on their old day before it moved to wednesday.  Were they pulling these same type of numbers? It sorta seems like they cannibilized themselves a little bit just out of Vince's ego needing to crush the competition or whatever.

AEWOfficial,fdlbi81,t3_elzax1,1578520491.0,Jack Evans(and Angelico) are so freaking good.  I hope they get a little push this year.
AEWOfficial,fdk1s4x,t3_elng3l,1578493927.0,Awesome pic man.  I saw on twitter Chuckie T was there too apparently The Bucks were nice enough to let him have the court seats.  :lol
AEWOfficial,fcxoy74,t3_ejhhk2,1578068073.0,Higher than I was expecting.  I thought the Sugar Bowl would have cut into it more.
brooklynninenine,fcxljo6,t1_fcwprp9,1578065853.0,"Yeah, once they dropped the whole Boyle pining after Rosa thing both of those characters got a whole lot better.  Also Boyle found his perfect match in Genevieve."

As a harm reduction thing its been huge as booze was destroying me.  Also helps I got a medical card now I have access to amazing strains and shit. 

It just helps turn my brain down a little so Im not constantly over thinking everything and making myself anxious.  Helps me actually sleep, too.  I know its not a good thing to rely on but right now Its helping and its waaaaaaaaay better for you than booze or benzos."
