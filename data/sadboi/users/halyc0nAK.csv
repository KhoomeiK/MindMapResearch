My mom has worked with mentally disabled kids and kids with severe behavior disorders for 20+ years and throughout high school and college I worked at a local nonprofit‚Äôs summer camp for nonfunctional/nonvocal autistic kids as a camp counselor and later as a yoga instructor, and in my very direct experience - a very common motive, the very one that I was motivated by, is simply the sheer inspiration that disabled children are. They don‚Äôt have the filters of who and how they should be that us normies are conditioned into having our whole lives and it‚Äôs just a very pure energy to witness, one that teaches you a lot about self worth, self acceptance, self love and many more life lessons. And the gratification that comes from protecting all of those beautiful energies is immeasurable. If money wasn‚Äôt a thing and I could afford to fly back to my hometown just to work that summer camp every year again, I would do it in a heartbeat, not out of some narcissistic desire for praise but because of how much fun it is, how much it teaches you about yourself and how beautiful it is when you accept the world as your teacher in the way of caring for special needs populations. If God blessed my womb with a child of these difficulties, I would feel graced each day that I am privileged to bear witness to that level of purity for a literal lifetime (wether that lifetime is infancy or lives 20 or 30 years) and I would be humbled before my God each time the challenge of protection became, well, a challenge, and the ability to humble yourself before your Creator is beautiful in its own way."

There is a reason why Jesus spent most of his time with life‚Äôs castaways. After the war that resulted in the death of John The Baptist, Jesus and his disciples traveled a long way to the home of someone rather fortunate, and Mary Magdalene, a known sinner, felt unworthy to enter the home with them; unworthy of Christ‚Äôs love because of her sin. Upon entering, she immediately assumed the role of consoling the heart of Christ, who was restless from their journey, by washing his feet with her tears and drying it with her hair, kissing his feet while washing him. The host turned to Jesus and said that surely he can‚Äôt be our Messiah if he can know of the sins Mary of Magdala has committed and still welcome her presence. Christ‚Äôs response was that he, the son of God, entered this man‚Äôs home and he did not give Him water for his feet after walking many days in sandals to reach him, and not even a kiss when greeting him, yet Mary took it upon herself to be charitable in the way of comfort to Christ through the gesture of caring for him in this way, and that He welcomes Mary because her love deserves. He then turned to Mary and said that her love has payed for her sins. You are like Mary in this way. The love you extend to others cleanses you. Do not ever let the shadowy recesses of your past outshine the goodness of your heart, for love conquers all - even death and sin. May you be blessed."

rapecounseling,fg917u7,t3_exk5fa,1580633029.0,"The onus is NOT on you. It‚Äôs not your fault, you didn‚Äôt do anything to ask for or cause this to happen. No amount of self defense classes or boundaries about smoking/with whom you smoke can save you from someone else‚Äôs ability to hide their maliciousness long enough to gain your trust. It‚Äôs a grave injustice that someone was able to fool you into trusting them *so well* only to rape you. That says sooooo much more about the person who did this to you than it does about you and your rape-ability."

fixtagram,fg0oizw,t1_f3eupw3,1580411945.0,I‚Äôm 110 days late to the party but just wanted to say it‚Äôs not necessarily extra photoshop around her stomach. Spanx creates this affect.
FemaleDatingStrategy,fg097v9,t1_ffwzr0r,1580402931.0,"You‚Äôll only be unworthy to LVM. HVM are attracted to a level of wisdom that only an adult woman has. Age is a filter for LVM, so think of aging as developing a filter rather than losing worth - especially when aging does the opposite, it increases your worth (drastically too) by increasing your wisdom.


I like to be entertained so I have a tendency to look for entertaining FDS resources rather than ones that are strictly informational, here‚Äôs a video from a YouTube series I love that shows you the journey of becoming a HVW. One of the things that makes this woman‚Äôs series stand out to me is how in touch she is with divine masculine desires. Idk how old you are but if you‚Äôre still young or if you‚Äôre like me and just like the added entertainment factor, this might be a good option to learn from. There‚Äôs 30 episodes total.

NarcissisticSpouses,ffvjtby,t1_ffue1by,1580265795.0,"I‚Äôm talking about both - where the narc mom is awful to both the sane* parent AND the kids, and the supposedly ‚Äúsane‚Äù partner just stays in the relationship instead of getting out with the kids and/or when they do leave, they also leave the kids with the abusive narc and only save themselves."
NarcissisticSpouses,ffud2mr,t1_ffub1y1,1580239417.0,"Doing this will give your kids trauma, but they‚Äôre going to have traumatic memories due to having one narc parent anyways. Personally, I forgive my narcissistic mother because I understand her ignorance is blind. Your kids seeing that you are the same one doesn‚Äôt grant you any form of forgiveness, you will just also be labeled abusive. My father, who chose the gray rock method, I will NEVER forgive. Because he knew and understood the dynamic and rather than growing the fuck up and *actually* protecting his child, he just let us all live through it and then when they divorced (I was 12/13 at this point), outright refused to take me, knowing my mom is abusive. If anyone wants to do the actual right thing, drop the narc AND protect (actually protect) your kids.


Also - you need to model how to stand up for yourself to your kids *by standing up for them*. Otherwise they will spend their whole lives engaging in narcissistic abuse cycles because no one ever taught them how to walk away, how to protect themselves, how to defend themselves from emotional/psychological abuse and manipulation."

Nicegirlstories,ffg83u6,t1_ffc26cn,1579900502.0,"I really think you should read the body keeps the score. Talking about it in every conversation is actually extremely common and part of the behaviors I was saying are highly indicative of having been abused. In the body keeps the score they spend a whole chapter covering why trauma survivors do this (constantly talk about their trauma, feeling numb to it and making jokes while doing so). It has a lot to do with with neurological changes that chronic abuse that you cannot actually escape (such as being abused by your caretaker) causes. Your friends behaviors all sound like she has complex post traumatic stress disorder, something I am very familiar with as I have it. Just because you have been through similar circumstances and did not develop c-ptsd does not make your friends symptoms and signs of having it less valid or that they should be taken less seriously - wether or not one develops ptsd after trauma is based on too many varying factors to hinge it on ‚Äúwell I went through something similar and aren‚Äôt a total weirdo so they must be lying‚Äù - especially when being a weirdo is par for the course when you have a physiological injury (meaning when you have these neurological changes from trauma that cause you to become obsessed with your abuse in this particular way)."
Nicegirlstories,ffbeep1,t3_es9az9,1579761740.0,"as an adult victim of early childhood sexual abuse, I can confirm that all of her behaviors are absolutely indicative of having been abused. I would tread lightly when it comes to speaking as if she could potentially be lying, because the psychological harm that that causes actual victims is irreparable."
