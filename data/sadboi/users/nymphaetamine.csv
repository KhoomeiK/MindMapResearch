Plus, if a man reacts poorly or tries to blame me for being ""damaged"", boom- early asshole detection system. lol.

* Not bringing up my boundaries/dealbreakers and just blocking him if he violates them. I have a couple of hard boundaries regarding somewhat common/widely accepted things, like I will not date a guy that has close female friends or talks to his exes even casually. I am not comfortable with either at all, never have been, never will be, and I bring this up very early on so that A) I don't find out that he's besties with another woman or dated one of his female friends *after* I let myself get emotionally invested, and B) so he knows that if he ever crosses those boundaries after I lay them out and he agrees to them, it will unequivocally result in a breakup and he doesn't get to argue or pull the I dIdN't KnOw YoU'd Be UpSeT! card. 

* Not texting first. When I wanna talk, I wanna talk damnit. Now, if I find myself *always* texting first or if he habitually takes his sweet time responding, that's when I lose interest.

* Expecting the man to take care of me. I simply don't need this, nor do I want it. Dinners, gifts- bring 'em on! But I've been financially dependent on a man before and that's a position I will NEVER put myself in ever again."

Lol, no he doesn't. Impropriety has been going on since day one of this relationship and you haven't kicked him out. He knows you'll get mad but put up with it, maybe try to have a discussion about it, which he'll just talk his way out of and make you feel guilty for having emotions.

If it's the former, that's your past trauma acting up and it's completely normal to feel that way when starting a new relationship after getting out of a traumatic one. If it's the latter, that's your gut picking up on subtle signs that that person is dangerous in some way. Therapy is IMO a must after any abusive relationship, and meditation will also help you to get better at identifying emotions vs. instincts. Control your emotions, but *always* listen to your instincts.

The WORST are the coverts. I thought I had this shit down after dealing with my malignant/overt ex, I kept an eye out for the usual grandiose narc behaviors but then along came the covert with their ""I, too, have suffered"" act and I got bamboozled again."
survivinginfidelity,fp9p4f9,t1_fp9k9vk,1588431550.0,"Yup, zero tolerance is the only way to go. When your partner does some hurtful thing that's admittedly small in comparison to a lot of worse things, empaths will convince themselves it's NBD even though it's something *we'd* never do. But that kind of rationalizing is a very slippery slope to becoming a doormat. Forgive them flirting here, lying there, and before you know it you find yourself working on forgiving them for cheating. You think being understanding and forgiving of the more minor things will show them what a quality person you are, but all it does is teach them they can treat you like shit and you won't leave. 

People need to stop trying to understand terrible behavior. Some humans are just defective and need to be returned."
survivinginfidelity,fp8mrug,t1_fp8cdik,1588396546.0,"Yup. Lots of people will point the finger at you for having tRuSt IsSuEs but unless people give me reasons to trust them, I don't. Trust is a feeling, not a choice."
survivinginfidelity,fp8k7mk,t1_fp72v0r,1588394491.0,"Unfortunately, for a while it consisted of just deliberately going against my nature. I was pushed to my breaking point and decided that I was not going to tolerate any type of abuse from anyone anymore and no matter how much I might love someone and WANT things to work out with them, I HAVE to walk away if they are causing me harm. Make that resolution and stick to it, embrace the attitude of ""what's pleasant is not always right, and what's right is not always pleasant"". You might be sobbing uncontrollably while walking away and want nothing more that to turn around and run back to them, but you just have to strengthen your willpower and do the right thing. 

The biggest thing was just realizing my worth. I'm not perfect, but I'm a good person and I have a lot to offer. I deserve the same kindness I give others, and I am not obligated to be anyone's emotional punching bag. I am not here to absorb abuse or die for anyone else's sins. Once you pound it into your head that you deserve someone who's as good as you are, it gets much harder to settle for crumbs. 

I also learned everything I could about narcissists. Narcs and cheaters are basically one and the same, so learning to recognize the red flags for one will apply to the other as well. It's a bitter pill that some people are just evil and no special combination of words and unconditional love will fix them, but it's one you HAVE to swallow. CAN people change? Sure, but *you* won't be the one to change them. Let go of the fairytale that you're going to be the one who finally tames the beast.

I found new outlets for my empathy too. Instead of spending all of it on my partner, I spent it on my child, my friends, animals, myself, and even strangers on the internet who just needed some kind words. Then whenever my partner pulled some shenanigans, it was wayyy easier to stand up for myself and detach from them if my reserve of kindness and forgiveness had already been spent elsewhere. 

I identified the qualities and behaviors that a person must exhibit to be worthy of my time and emotions, and began approaching relationships from a return of investment standpoint. What do I get back from this person? Does their past behavior indicate a higher chance of future offenses, and is my forgiveness going to be wasted on them? Am I getting back a similar level of effort to what I'm putting forth? Not to say that relationships should be transactional, but you don't walk into a store and just hand over your money and walk out emptyhanded. In both love and friendship, there needs to be an equal exchange of emotional currency. No one is entitled to your emotions. YOU decide who you spend them on, so spend wisely.

Therapy also did wonders. I had a great therapist who helped me recognize that my SO's transgressions were not due to some failure on my part, but I was just being taken advantage of and manipulated by a predatory person. Finding communities of other people who've also been betrayed and knowing that you're not alone and you're not just crazy did wonders as well. Support from others can be the one thing that keeps you on the right path when you're exhausted and ready to fall back into the pattern of letting people have their way cause it's just easier. 

Lastly, getting out of the naive ""Just communicate!"" mindset was absolutely key. Real talk- your partner is a grown-ass adult. Unless they were raised by wolves, they learned right from wrong as children. Does it really make sense to keep telling yourself that they just don't understand that lying, cheating, or abuse is wrong and if you just talk to them about it, they'll stop? Quit texting paragraphs and spending countless hours trying to get them to understand how they hurt you. They know, *they just don't care*. You can flap your gums till the cows come home and it won't change a damn thing because whatever they did was what they *wanted* to do. They didn't just eat the last cookie or forget to flush, they made a conscious choice to do something that they KNEW would devastate you. They weighed the pros & cons of it and decided it was worth losing you over. Stop wasting time ""communicating"" with people whose actions make it clear that they don't give a shit about you."
survivinginfidelity,fp6pv1k,t3_gbkdg7,1588356525.0,"I think it's both honestly. I wouldn't say there's something WRONG with you, I would just guess you're picking/attracting the wrong people. There are certain qualities cheaters are more attracted to. Are you a kindhearted person who is trusting, quick to forgive, generous, and always looking for the best in people? AKA an empath? If so, congrats! You're cheater-bait. It really sucks because empathic qualities are wonderful and beautiful and the world would be a much better place if everyone had them, but sadly there are a lot of selfish, narcissistic people out there who see our kindness as a giant flashing target over our heads. They're drawn to empaths because our nature is to cling to the good and excuse the bad. We project our good onto everyone else and that is a jackpot for predatory people. We have an innate drive to rescue those we perceive as ""damaged"", which most cheaters are, and we have a very hard time walking away from anyone. They know we're more likely to buy the fake-crying and fauxpologies, because whenever WE apologize or cry it's always sincere. We don't stop to think that they might just be manipulating us, because WE would never do something so horrible to them. We're easier to guilt-trip and gaslight because the last thing we want to do is make anyone else feel bad. We believe them when they tell us our perfectly reasonable boundaries and completely justified feelings are controlling or suffocating because we don't want to make them unhappy. We break our own boundaries to make others more comfortable, we set ourselves on fire to keep others warm, and we suffer in silence rather than inconvenience anyone else with our feelings. I had to learn to stand up for myself, enforce my boundaries even when it makes people unhappy, and reserve my trust & kindness for those who prove themselves worthy. It was *hard*. Changing your very nature is not easy at all and it doesn't feel good, but sometimes it's necessary to protect yourself.

I do think cheating is a lot more common nowadays too. I'm pushing 40 and I did a lot of my dating back before the constant connectedness of the internet, smartphones, and social media, and cheating was a lot harder to get away with back then. Pre-2005ish I only ever had maybe 2 guys cheat on me since I first started dating back in the mid-90s. Now though- every time I've caught a boyfriend cheating or trying to over the past 15 years(and I've lost count of how many), it was with someone he'd met or reconnected with on Facebook, Snapchat, IG, or some instant messenger. Back in the day you had to put in a lot more effort to have affairs but now, it just takes a few clicks/taps. Mere seconds to send nudes, sext, get all the emotional & sexual attention you want from someone other than your partner. Hell, one of my exes carried on multiple full-blown emotional affairs just over Facebook messenger. The lines are a lot more blurred now too, people take online affairs far less seriously than physical ones, I guess because they think ""it's just talking"" but the betrayal is just as real and devastating as if they went out and hooked up with someone. There's also the laziness factor- people who would have been put off by the effort ""analog"" infidelity required will have no problem sliding down the slippery slope of shooting a flirty DM to an old crush, an ex, a hot coworker, etc. This is the main reason social media is a dealbreaker for me in relationships now. Call me controlling, insecure, overbearing, whatever. Doesn't hurt my feelings one bit. I've seen how people, even ones that I thought were honest and loyal, behave on there and I'm not taking that chance again. 

It really does feel hopeless sometimes :/"
NarcissisticAbuse,fp5mbzw,t3_gbabh1,1588334229.0,"I could write a book about all the red flags I ignored but there's one that I only recently realized WAS a red flag.

I met my Nex after starting a new job a few years ago. He was in my training class and a few weeks after we both started there, he invited me to a group lunch with a bunch of the other guys in the class. We were not romantically involved AT ALL at this point, just co-trainees, and I went along cause I was trying to make an effort to be more social. He insisted I ride with him and I agreed, mostly because he had a model of car that I was considering buying and I was curious to ride in one. lol. We met the rest of the group at a chinese buffet, I got my plate and sat down, and another coworker I'd chatted a bit with during class started heading over to sit next to me. Nex literally sped-walked over with his half-loaded plate and told the guy ""sit somewhere else, that's MY seat"" in a very stern voice. The other guy gave him a confused look then sat down at the other end of the table. I didn't think too much of it at the time, in fact my dumb ass actually felt a bit flattered that he wanted to sit next to me so badly. Looking back now though it was the human equivalent of a gorilla beating his chest to chase the other males away from his mate. He was staking his claim on me before I'd even consented to being ""his"".

I wish that other guy had told Nex to kick rocks and sat next to me anyway. Not because I had any interest in him, but maybe the *slightest* alteration in the events of that day would have prevented me from having my whole life torn to pieces by this guy. Like when you go back in time, kill a single butterfly, and alter the entire future and whatnot."

FemaleDatingStrategy,fp5a3ng,t3_gascv6,1588321674.0,"Yup, twice. First time was like 15 years ago. One day I called the guy and his girlfriend answered and cussed me out. She went through his phone and found our texts. I knew who she was because they had a kid together but I had no idea they were actually still together, the bastard lied to me. I guess she got my number from his phone cause she texted me later that night apologizing for blowing up and asking for more details. I spilled every last bean including all the shit he'd talked about her. She thanked me, I wished her the best, and I found out a while later that she left him and went after him for child support üë∏

The second time was only a year or two after that and it was a similar situation. Guy lied to me about being single, we dated for a month or so, girlfriend found our texts. She messaged me on MySpace(yes I'm old) and asked if she could call me. We talked for a while and once again I told her everything. How he presented himself as single, that I had no idea she existed, and I'm sorry he did that to her and sorry for my part in it. She was crying the whole time and my heart just broke for her. She stayed with him though and then a month or so later when he tried to talk to me again, she messaged me again threatening to beat me up. SMH. I got a random whim to look them both up a few years ago and they're still together, they have a child now, and she's gained about 100lbs ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  

I would 100% narc again, no matter what the girlfriend or wife's reaction. She can be a fool and stay with him if she wants, but she deserves to know either way plus it's personally satisfying to bust these goons. I wish all my exes' other women would have told me."
AmItheAsshole,fp535hu,t3_gb1e4d,1588314791.0,"YTA. Your ""friend"" has feelings for you and your wife is most likely already uncomfortable with you hanging out with her. You took this knowledge and instead of calling your wife after you were done with work because it was still plenty early to do something together, you proceeded to go on a 4-hour coffee date with another woman *on your anniversary* while ignoring your wife's calls the whole time. And you can't understand what you did wrong, *really?*

Stop playing dumb. If by some infinitesimally small chance you aren't having an affair with this woman, this was a pants-on-head stupid move and you should have known better. Don't pontificate about trust, not wanting to bother your wife, or that YOU wouldn't suspect anything if she blew you off to go out some other guy who has the hots for her till 1am. You know exactly how this looks and you know good and well this was not appropriate behavior for a married person. If I were your wife, there would have been divorce papers on the counter the very next day. I guarantee she hasn't calmed down. She's just being civil while she gets things in order to leave you."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fp4zsj9,t3_gawr1x,1588311882.0,"Trusting my gut took me a long time to learn, but it's the most invaluable instinct you will ever have.

And don't discount your gut feelings just because you have anxiety either. I have anxiety too but you can learn to differentiate between general anxiety about potential harm and a legitimate bad feeling about a specific person. Examine your thoughts when you start to feel unsettled- are they along the lines of ""I've been hurt so many times, I'm afraid he'll hurt me too"", or are they more like ""Every time I interact with him, something just feels off"".

FemaleDatingStrategy,fokaqfh,t1_fojmiip,1587838559.0,"I dug it back out and here are some excerpts(leaving all his typos & bad grammar intact lol);

*""So I look at pics that other people post. Instead of it being of a car or a weapon, or a dog, its a chick. I have no communications with anyone on those sites. I told you from the start, If i like a pic, regardless of what it is, I like, hate, laugh, wow,or sad the post. Every once in a while i post a comment, but it is never to any of the chick's pics. I respect our relationship, I respect you and what you do on your account, yes I see it from your point of view. But its clear you do nit see it from mine. And that is the issue we have. So me looking is on iFunny,and groups or pages I like on Facebook. It is not a secret, and I don't hide it from you, I just don't look at it while you are with me. That is your request, and that is me respecting you. I know you don't like the groups or certain pages, and you don't like it when Facebook brings up those to you. I don't like it when Facebook brings up stuff other people look at, and you know what I do? I close it out, or open options, and say it does not apply to me, and Facebook removes it. That is being a adult about Facebook, if you don't like it you can bitch about it, or you can block it and move on. You don't like that I look at pics, it makes you feel like you're not enough, and that can lead to cheating or what ever else comes up. With everything that I have done for this relationship, to show everything, to communicate with you, to be open towards you, still yet some how it still isn't enough to show or prove I am not doing anything bad or wrong. I am sick of doing everything I can think of and then some, just so you can get upset that i have some dumb group, or page on any social media, that you no longer or my fiancee but you become my moral mother. I don't need that from you.""*

This was in response to yet another fight about this shit before he left for work one night. Nothing but excuses and lies. He WAS in communication with those women 
and he DID leave comments on their pics. He WAS looking at it in front of me, which is why I said something about it to begin with. But I was just childish and trying to ""mother him"". I can't believe he tried to claim he didn't do it in front of me too. Not only did he(and I once even caught him looking at porn at *my mom's house* while she was 5 feet away from him), but he would mutter out loud ""wow"", ""ooh"" and ""nice"" as he was scrolling. The groups he mentioned were porn-sharing groups with names like ""guns tits 'n' beer"" and ""proud perverts"". I would eventually catch him in literally a dozen different fetish-oriented dating groups. Asian dating, BBW dating, BDSM dating, casual hookups, etc. 

*""Yes I am stressed. Money always makes me stressed. Everyday I have to plan out what we can and can't spend so I know we can start trying to pay off past dues, and bills, and anything that is in collections, so we as a couple can have a better credit score, so we can finally move out of an apt, and into a house. Yea I am the one who pushed you to get a can with a car payment, because we can not afford a 500 fix bill every month, and that once we started to have battery issues, that is when we should have started this, because yes, if we didn't make that 500 dollar fix, we would not be hurting.""*

He painted this picture of us like I was some reckless spender and he was the long-suffering man trying to hold everything together when in reality I was paying the utilities & rent while he only paid the internet bill and spent the rest of his money on car stuff($1200 headlights, $400 exhaust, etc). And me buying a new car? That was MY decision, after he pushed me for months to surrender the car I had when we met back to the bank cause HE thought the payments were too high. I was only a year away from paying it off but he insisted I return it cause he wanted me to get a cheap cash car instead so ""we"" would have more money left over each month. I finally agreed under the condition that he would buy the car since I was making $11/hr at the time with no savings and he had plenty in the bank from his SSI payments. He bought me a $1500 clunker that ended up costing more per month to keep it running than what I was paying on my old car. After a couple months I'd had enough of it breaking down so I found a newer car for around $300/mo and purchased it without his permission or help. No idea why he tried to take credit for that, I guess to gaslight me further and make it seem like he only wanted the best for me? I'm still waiting for my credit to recover from the surrender too. 

*""I am at my wits end. I am tired, worn out and just at a point. This is a couples relationship, but most of the time it feels like I am the only one trying to keep us afloat. And I know with you working you are going to come home tired like me, and not want to do anything. I get that. But you said you wanted the house wife life, Coming home to see bowls that have been sitting the for a day or two, still has what ever food is left in it, cups and plates filled in the sink. Its not that much to ask that you put it in the dish washer every night before bed?""*

LMAO. Not only did he have so little respect for me that he wouldn't even give up his facebook hoes, *I* wasn't keeping the place clean enough for him. Bitching about how much I do in MY apartment no less, that HE moved into and didn't even help pay for OR clean. And I don't recall ever saying I wanted the ""housewife life"" either, that was HIS fetish. Did I mention he liked to crossdress too? I digress though. There were maybe a couple times when I was too tired to do dishes and put it off till the next day cause I was working full-time, and never once did I leave old bowls full of food cause that's fucking disgusting. His entitlement was just off the charts.

*""My plate is always full, and honestly i want to get rid of half, and not need to stress and worry so much, and yes that would change my mood and I would smile more. But I am just not happy. I put a brave face on for you everyday while I try to figure out money, gas, food, and what not's for the pupps. There has been days where I just want to say fuck it, and walk away. But I can't. That is not who I am, and I stay because I love you. Yes my depression has been getting worse, even tho the weather is changing and I am getting tan/sun, my depression is getting worse, and it takes that much more to handle and that much more energy to handle and keep in control, and yes it affects my sex drive, that is when I have one to start. This is part of dating and living with a Veteran that is heavily damaged.""*

He allllways tried to play the ""I do so much for you"" card so he could blame his anger problems and constant bad mood on me when all he did was go to work, mess around online, yell at me, and sleep.

He would always respond by telling me I was just insecure, he was just a friendly guy and he's sorry that *I* took his *niceness* as flirting(yeah, calling your female friends ""babe"" and ""beautiful"" is totally just friendship in action üôÑ), and by the way did I realize I was driving him away with my ""wild spending""(AKA getting a Starbucks coffee a couple times a week) and he was about ready to walk away himself? Side note, I was cleaning out my inbox last night and came across the 10,000-word essay he sent me about this, I should post it for giggles. Anyway, the breaking point came one night when I had once again caught him watching porn right next to me and this time he blew up, shouting ""Well if you'd get those implants we talked about and tone your ass up a bit then I wouldn't have to look at other women!""

Done. 

Took me another couple months to get everything in order to kick him out but that was the moment when any warm feelings I still had left for him went ice cold."

You're a bully. You didn't want to help her, you just saw an opportunity to benefit from her desperation. YOUR behavior is disgusting and the way you talk about her is too. She's 22 and was living paycheck to paycheck from a low-paying job, but she's somehow at fault for not having any savings?

You are not mature enough to be in a relationship. 

She doesn't live there, she is your *invited guest*. You make 6 figures a year and you wanna bill her $24/day for coming over? What is wrong with you? You're not doing her some kind of favor or service, you're in a relationship with her and getting her time, love, attention, and sex in return for your ""utilities"". If my bf ever tried to bill me for the privilege of coming over I'd hand him back his key and tell him to enjoy the single life. 

> I love her, I just also don't want to be used as a sugar daddy while she's in school. You never know with girls these days

If he stops liking yours, rest assured he's off liking someone else's. If you're in a relationship and he's liking some other girl's selfies don't believe him for one split second when he tells you he likes everyone's pics or he just thought it was a good picture. That like is the equivalent of a flirty wink and he's hoping she'll start paying attention to him.

I am so sick of casual sex being pushed as this ""empowering"", fun, totally healthy pastime that's consequence-free as long as you wrap it up. Whether or not you acknowledge it, sex is a biological bonding experience and your brain forms an attachment to your sexual partner even after one time. Most men treat it no differently than playing a game with a friend but for women, our emotional wellbeing and self-esteem take a big hit when we give that part of ourselves to a man and then never hear from him again. It's not healthy at all and I have yet to meet a single person with healthy self-esteem(*actual* healthy self-esteem, not to be confused with arrogance or narcissism) who participates in hookup culture."

FemaleDatingStrategy,fo3o19r,t1_fo3mj6r,1587490111.0,"Men themselves aren't really going to change the way they see you, cheaters are gonna cheat no matter what. They'll still try to trick you, but we're far better equipped to recognize the red flags early instead of being ""understanding"" and giving them the benefit of the doubt when your gut is going off. 

The biggest changes so far have been in my self-esteem and the ability to enforce boundaries. Stuff I'd overlook or forgive in the past, I slam the brakes on now. I used to think I had to be endlessly forgiving if I wanted to be in a relationship, but that was only because I was in the mindset that I NEEDED to be in one. Now I can honestly say I'm completely fine with being alone if no one ends up living up to my standards. I have my career, my hobbies, my family, a few good friends, and the man that I choose to allow in my life must either add to it in many positive ways without causing me stress, or else I will go back to being alone. I would have never been able to say that with any honesty before but I can now."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fo3l20j,t1_fo3klzb,1587488691.0,"I wish I could say that's shocking, but it's basically par for the course. I would have added his wife's email to his profile and set it to email her every time he gets tagged in anything or gets a message. lol"
FemaleDatingStrategy,fo3iqm9,t3_g5dqd0,1587487577.0,"I guess objectively it would depend on their activity level. If he rarely posts anything and doesn't get on it much at all, it's not THAT big a deal as long as his relationship status is visible and people know he's with me. If he's active though, there better be pictures of me/us, his friends better know who I am, and he better not be trying to hide his activity or acting weird about his messages. 

Honestly though- either way it doesn't matter. I've dated guys who were active on facebook, who posted pics of us together and tagged me in stuff only to find out later that they had a private friend list of ""prospects"", were members of dating/porn groups, were blocking the girls they were talking dirty to when they were with me and then unblocking them whenever we were apart, and had set their relationship status and every post with me in it to private so nobody could tell they had a girlfriend. Guys can get verrrry creative with their privacy settings, so even if it seems like he's an open book and is proud to show you off, it can all be a complete facade. 

Nowadays, a man just using social media at all is a red flag after all the shit I've seen. I'm old and have been in the dating game before social media became a thing, I've seen what it does to relationships and it's NOT good. I know I know, it's a *tool* and it's all about how you use it, but my overwhelming experience is that most men use it as an Ashley Madison alternative. Every time I've caught a guy cheating or engaging in any kind of shady shit within the past 10 or so years he was doing it on facebook, IG, snapchat, or some other social platform that encouraged 'connecting' with new people & allowed him to keep in touch with women he had no business keeping in touch with. I've only ever met maybe one or two men that didn't use social media as a meat market. I hesitate to date any man who uses it unless he's VERY open about it and I could check it any time. And even then. It's just a huge trust barrier, I could never fully trust a man who uses it. If that makes me crazy then whatever, pass me a straightjacket."

Kind of a tangent here but I'm really starting to think the current crop of shitty men were born of the 90s-to-present ""never make a child feel bad, everyone gets a trophy, reward instead of punish, everyone is special and perfect"" parenting style. These men are raised to believe they are indigo children who can do no wrong and should never feel guilty, unhappy, or ashamed, and thus narcissists are created.

I kind of gauge their personality over the course of the first few dates, check out their social media to check his interactions with other women, then bring it up after that. I'll say something like ""I can see this going somewhere, but I have a pretty stiff boundary about friendships with exes. It's a dealbreaker for me so I'd like to discuss it now to avoid issues later on. Do you still talk to any of yours?"" If they say yes, I used to give them the option to cut contact if they wanted to keep seeing me, but nowadays I'd probably just move on after how many times I've caught boyfriends talking to an ex again even after agreeing to cut them out. I've found that most men will take your ""no"" to mean ""wait a while and see if she changes her mind"", so it's a lot easier to start off with a guy who's values already align with yours on this matter."
