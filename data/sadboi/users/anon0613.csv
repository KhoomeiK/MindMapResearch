You say that the security guard is a “health care provider”, I disagree but let’s say that they are.

The straw man is on the LSAT in the LR section. Some of the answer choices use this flaw. 

Ex: Two speakers are talking. One states an argument. The other says “So what you’re really saying is...(something that has nothing to do with the argument, blows it out of proportion, etc)”. They have distorted the argument. That is a straw man.

Edit: I confused one of the terms for being left out. I stand by Ad Populum. 

“is an *emotively laden argument* for the acceptance of an unproved conclusion by adducing evidence of the feelings, prejudices, or beliefs of a large group of people”.

Ex: 90% of people like Pluto, so Pluto is superior. (The evidence of feeling is acceptance. And apparently acceptance proves this belief).

Also I have yet to see the term “Ad Populum” on the LSAT, correct me if I’m wrong I haven’t taken every prep test, the LSAT isn’t testing if you know the Latin names of these fallacies. They just wanna know if you can spot it, realize that it is wrong, and understand why it is wrong."

I supported myself and I was married. 

They got angry because they owed $10k in taxes because of that. I am now divorced and I live with them. The only reason it’s about the check was because that was what I was counting on to go to college. I can’t get it and there’s no changing that.

The only reason they can claim me right now is because I am a full time student. So I feel like they need to be contributing to that if they want to claim me. I don’t have enough to pay for college even with loans. So even if I could, I can’t go to college on my own.

So, I want them to contribute and if not I won’t go. Mostly because I can’t, but I want them to know the consequences of me not going: A 10k tax bill. It’s easier for them to pay $2-4K for my college than to shell out 10k."

She should have contacted you about subs and stayed in contact with you to let you know the delivery would be late. She also should have asked you if you were okay with receiving a late delivery.

I would rate AT MOST 3 stars if I were you. I would also contact Shipt and get a refund for the subs."
