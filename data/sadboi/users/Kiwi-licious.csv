If she can get it out verbally as it is coming on, it can dissuade or lessen the physical and emotional triggers much more. It probably won‚Äôt go away completely, but it may help her to decompress a bit. 

I was at a baseball game with my hubby today and I asked him if we could go out the closest exit when we left because I didn‚Äôt want people looking at me (it made me feel violated and triggered). Just voicing that was huge. So if she is able to in the moment, encourage it. 

Also, tell her that she is safe. Tell her that the danger has passed and she is safe now with you. I know it may sound janky or obvious at first, but she is truly re-experiencing an awful thing as if it were happening again. So to her the danger is so real.

you straight up read my mind. It‚Äôs spooky. 

I was JUST thinking about some of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù from pre-ptsd time. 

I have tried MANY times to find a time with them to explain what is going on. They casually ‚Äúforget‚Äù each time or have something else going on. 

Instead, they want to talk behind my back and not listen to a word I have to say. 

Either that or they will not believe me (the most INFURIATING and re-traumatizing thing in the world) and will even call me ‚Äúobsessive‚Äù or say that I am acting like a middle schooler etc. I know it comes from a place of ignorance, but the fact that they hold this ptsd issue at arms length and will not enter into it to understand this person I am now, it makes me realize that it is a willful ignorance. That is also extremely frustrating to me. 

They almost literally put their heads in the sand and refuse to know or try to understand. 

It makes me see them for who they really are. It‚Äôs not that I have lost these friends, this event has brought out the truth in a really rough, yet clear, way. 

Seriously though. I was just in a trigger moment thinking about these friends, who are really my husbands friends. Not mine. Not now anyway... 
and I was feeling very sad and I even cried because I feel this ptsd shit will never go away. 

It will always be around I think, but just quieter.

Men need to have better standards for themselves. 

Men need to not pat other men on the back or let other men act like that. period. I bet there were men on that sub station who let it happen too. Someone could have asked you if you felt uncomfortable and stood beside you. Something. 

We need men who agree with respecting women and trust them to fight for us in public. To be honest, there is only so much that we can do as women. And the way society has been going and the increasingly hostile attitudes toward women, often fueled by the propaganda in the porn industry, men subconsciously let it happen in public and otherwise. There is some research done on that. Not to freak you out more or trigger you more or anything. Not all men are deeply indoctrinated like that. It is hard when in a trigger moment not to see ALL men that way. But it is not all. 

Men still do need to step up in this arena..."

Personally,I am 9 months out. Has he stopped since you found out or at least put in the effort to get it out? For many men, this is extremely difficult.

Anyway, let me tell you something‚Äî you both are on a journey now, and 2 very different ones. 

You are on a journey to be happy in yourself, and realize that his porn use has nothing to do with you. My therapist told me ‚Äúit‚Äôs apples and oranges‚Äù what he has with you is not what he has with porn. It‚Äôs not about your body verses theirs. It is not a comparison thing. I did that for so long and it is hard to snap out of or even fully understand. But any time you are starting to feel that about yourself, just think ‚Äúapples and oranges‚Äù addiction is not love, and vice versa. 

He is on a journey to stop making what happened to you a shame episode for himself. My husband did this too. When he falls into shame, keep reminding him that this is trauma. Not you lying or being unforgiving. Accept that he just doesn‚Äôt understand right now. He will be on a journey of getting clean, and getting clean is very hard in this culture. It‚Äôs everywhere. 

So, where we are at now: I hardly think about his porn use at all. I can start to watch a decent amount of shows without getting too uncomfortable (sometimes I still have to fast forward things or I get a reminder here and there and it sends me back a bit, but nothing crazy). 

He is making strides as well. He is a beer delivery man and he has to deliver everywhere. Yesterday he (completely on his own) told the guy who creates his routes that he doesn‚Äôt want to deliver to strip clubs unless it is on off hours. Then, in front of his extremely porn-positive driver co-workers, he went off about strippers and how it shouldn‚Äôt be legal, as well as prostitution (here in NY, they are thinking of legalizing prostitution, just bringing traffickers here...fuckin A) he also said that porn shouldn‚Äôt be legal either, as it is basically on camera prostitution. 

I am so effing proud of him. And if he does slip, which he hasn‚Äôt in a very long time, I remember ‚Äúapples and oranges‚Äù and I don‚Äôt take it personally at all. I definitely have trigger moments still and I‚Äôm sure that won‚Äôt go away, but he has proven that he is becoming a safe person and I don‚Äôt ever want to see that porn zombie man that took over my husband before, and in time, he is taking strides and understanding just how much of a hold it had on him. I hope the same for you!"

Me and my hubby are actually in a good place right now. What I did is I went to therapy and put myself unapologetically first. I detached. I let his opinion matter a whole lot less. I started getting my own friends and living my own life. I started connecting with who I was before him. Then I left for a while. Those 8 days really helped him to get his head out of his ass and realize that I had ptsd. Now he supports me and we talk about it more often. 
Honestly, with therapy, antidepressants, and doing me unapologetically, I am in such a good place. Of course set boundaries and consequences around the behavior. Mine had actually stopped (for the most part, sometimes he will slip and look up some provocative girl on FB) but it is nowhere near where it was. He was an entirely different person when deeply involved. 

Anyway, if he has still continued, set firm boundaries and stick to them. If he stops, then healing and therapy, counseling will help so much."

loveafterporn,eq0u955,t1_eq0tl6e,1559694511.0,"Ugh, sounds like a bunch of addicts as well. When I uncovered this issue to some of my close friends, I found that my friends were mostly involved in it in one form or another. One of my friends is actually a full blown and unapologetic addict. She is out about her addiction. My other female friend also watches stuff. I was just so surprised how prevalent this all is. I never entered the online porn world. I watched a couple as a teen on HBO, and that was all relatively straight forward and showed one scene at a time. I went in and checked what the deal was for about 5 minutes and was bombarded with constant videos that I didn‚Äôt even want to be seeing. They didn‚Äôt give me a choice. I got on quickly to see if my husband had an account there with his email, and I couldn‚Äôt leave without seeing all types of gross stuff. 

To me, that is a problem, they are crossing a boundary by just bombarding you with videos whether you like it or not. 
But that is a different story. Many women are now becoming hooked, and it is very sad."
loveafterporn,eq0tk1y,t1_eq0sjvl,1559693989.0,"I am seeing a CSAT and attending a 12 step group for myself. The closest CSAT that would see him (mine doesn‚Äôt want to because she doesn‚Äôt want any opportunity for triangulation) is 2 hours away and he already works a manual labor job that he is exhausted from. 

So the next step would be a 12 step group if he wasn‚Äôt able to get this under control on his own. If he was not able to, then he would have to admit to himself that this is an addiction and he does not want to do that. I know it is and that it will always be in his life because it has continually come back time and again in his life, even in our marriage. He felt more comfortable turning to that because it was all he knew. It also goes against everything he believes in so, I see it as an addiction even if he denies it. 

But he has been able to get it under control. He does not try to find ways to view it. He skips over anything remotely provocative on tv, and we have even started communicating about triggers we see in public together and he assures me that all is well. 

This is all a very recent development because for a very long while he couldn‚Äôt take the shame of the pain this has caused. When I finally flat out told him that I don‚Äôt respect him or trust him, and then I left and told him I didn‚Äôt know when I was coming back, he finally started manning up and started showing up emotionally and verbally, mentally, physically, in our marriage."
loveafterporn,eq0sv16,t1_eq0s9d7,1559693433.0,"That is insane. It really makes me shake my head and see how far this world has come and how deeply indoctrinated people are on the topic. 

Not only are men trapped in this cycle of reward, shame, withdrawal, escalation, etc. but their wives/partners are writing it off as normal and nodding in approval. 

It just is not wise in my opinion. It is allowing your man to train himself to be discontent, lacking emotion, intimacy, and allowing yourself the same as a woman. 

I don‚Äôt want to succumb to this culture‚Äôs idea of sexuality. I don‚Äôt want to enter into this part of culture. I have toyed with the idea since I have been shown the ugly butthole part of society now and seen its prevalence. I have had days where I tell myself ‚Äúwell, everyone is doing this, so why fight?‚Äù But I just don‚Äôt want to enter into that culture, and I don‚Äôt think I should be forced to."
loveafterporn,eq0rpbl,t1_eq0r5wx,1559692505.0,"Yes, idk what it is about BabyCenter or communities like that, but the people they attract are sort of in your face and militant about their stance, especially on porn. It‚Äôs weird but I noticed that too. I had never relied on them as a community though so I‚Äôm glad I dodged that bullet."
loveafterporn,eq0ridw,t1_eq0qxbt,1559692353.0,"I would say one slip and one relapse. And the relapse was not even porn (I have a bunch of blocks on his phone and he doesn‚Äôt use any other devices) but a picture of someone dressed slightly provocatively. This was month 2 into his recovery and the discovery. He didn‚Äôt voice it, but I knew his password on his phone and he didn‚Äôt know so I saw it. I knew he would relapse though because he had been acting very depressed that day and full of shame. I think he was even feeling suicidal. 

So I guessed that  he was going to turn to it before he actually did. Then when I saw it the next morning, I was not shocked. 

That was months ago and that was the last relapse, or even slip up, I have seen."
loveafterporn,eq0qa5z,t3_bwvohv,1559691390.0,"That is a really good point. I am a big fan of Terry Crews. He talks about the ‚Äúcult of masculinity‚Äù. It was truly an eye opener and speaks to a lot of the social pressure for men to be essentially sex predators in their thinking

loveafterporn,eq0oaj2,t1_eq0nwoz,1559689835.0,"Thanks, me too. Here‚Äôs to hoping ü§ûüèª"
loveafterporn,eq0moxi,t1_eq0mee8,1559688592.0,"That‚Äôs a good point. I had voiced that concern to him when he wanted to do it. He told me that by allowing him to do that, it helps him turn away from porn when I‚Äôm gone for a period of time. I definitely felt conflicted by allowing that, but I did. I think my boundary would be that he could do that if I was gone for a long period of time like I was when I was gone, but that he cannot turn to pictures of other women that he has no right to. 

Idk, I‚Äôm still navigating that. If it becomes a problem, we can change the boundary to more strict"
loveafterporn,eq0me69,t1_eq0li5p,1559688368.0,It‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm definitely on alert still. The fact that he isn‚Äôt hiding in shame whenever I share my feelings is a big encouragement though
loveafterporn,eq0jwbz,t1_eq0jl83,1559686513.0,"Yes, I think that is a good point. I‚Äôll have to look into the trauma bond more to see if I can learn more about it. I have heard of it here and there but only know so much"
loveafterporn,eq0iz2x,t1_eq0i2pk,1559685836.0,"Yes, that makes sense. Thanks for that point!"
loveafterporn,eq0h99y,t3_bwua47,1559684663.0,"10 months since he quit, with a relapse or 2"
loveafterporn,eq0h7xa,t1_eq0gwzp,1559684644.0,8 months
loveafterporn,eq0d8vw,t3_bwbs58,1559682491.0,"Yess!!! Hang onto those moments when they come. Expect your trauma to keep coming back though. Not sure how far along you are, but so glad to hear this"
loveafterporn,epxv783,t1_epxu9zf,1559611720.0,"I know that feeling all too well. Right now, you are not yourself. The person you are now is not who you were before DDay. I know my very identity was thrown into a wood chipper essentially and this bitter, anxious, hypervigiliant person came out the other side. 

But once you can take a step back and let him make his own bad decisions, or let him make good decisions and save the relationship, you put the pressure on him to stop being a child and you stop being a parent, tell him either he is done with porn or done with you and that he seriously needs to make a choice. Or if you have already done that and have backed off of ultimatums now, then saying that he needs to be up front when he relapses and that he needs to cough up his phone any time you ask for it, at any moment. 

Setting those boundaries, when you are in a place to set them, can really benefit you and him from having this toxic parent/child dynamic."
loveafterporn,epwzxq7,t1_epwzla1,1559588740.0,"I wish there was a straight forward answer to that question. On the top of my head though, I can say first: selfishness. Then beyond that, there is addiction. The compulsive action literally hijacks the brain. Then calloused attitudes toward sex, women, love, you name it. Their whole belief system is twisted. Porn has made the sexual experience more like a shopping trip than anything intimate. They look for ‚Äúthe one‚Äù and ‚Äúthe one‚Äù that is the image/video of choice. These choices often reveal something about his insecurities. For my husband, he looked at fat women, because he struggles with weight. He looked at gay stuff, because he was picked on about his lack of masculinity growing up. Etc. porn puts them in a futile pursuit of the very thing you hold for him‚Äî intimacy, closeness, and companionship. And of course I‚Äôm sure you are gorgeous and stunningly beautiful, so you give that to him as well. 

Many times unless they are jolted into an ultimatum of you telling him you‚Äôre leaving will he ever snap out of the hypnotic state and toxicity of his porn use."
loveafterporn,epwywlt,t1_epwygha,1559588035.0,"I know just what you mean. I have experienced such shame when I look at myself. I mean, I am flawed. I am not perfect by any means. But let me tell you something‚Äî I know for certain that these men hide behind porn because of their own insecurity surrounding women. Not because of how you look or don‚Äôt look. 

So don‚Äôt let his insecurities suck you in and bring you down to his level. Sometimes I‚Äôll just look at myself in the shower and think how disgusting I look. I am absolutely brutal to myself, and it is definitely his fault. But please know that he is the problem, not you... 

I know, easier said than done, and on good days I can see it better and on bad days I can‚Äôt even look at myself"
loveafterporn,epwuksl,t1_epwt37x,1559585043.0,Mine sometimes too. I think for him it is about lasting longer though. Sometimes he will have the lights on though
