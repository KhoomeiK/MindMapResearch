The dog was like their baby, but one day ended up attacking and killing the woman when her husband wasn’t home. I’m not saying this would happen to your family, but he has given warning signs of potentially dangerous behavior that has continued to escalate and ignoring it or brushing it off rather than actively trying to change his behavior through positive reinforcement could lead to something disastrous. 

Getting to a behaviorist or trainer is a necessity to keep your family and their dog safe. There is a whole Facebook group dedicated to people who have had to euthanize their babies for behavioral reasons because they were risks to themselves and their humans. I’ve read so many heart wrenching stories of people having to go through this because their babies had attacked them out of the blue and multiple times. Often time it is unchecked anxiety and the dog is mentally suffering day in and day out from internal relentless stress. Seeing a behaviorist or trainer can help lead you in the right direction and may advise anti anxiety meds for the dog if that may be the issue. He does seem to be exhibiting resource guarding with his food and may be doing the same thing with your mother. I’m not a trainer, just have experience with resource guarding dogs and have done lots of reading and research. 


I hope your family and Motley the best. Do right by Motley and get ahead of the behavioral issues now."
reactivedogs,f42a78e,t3_devsdb,1571329310.0,"I’m concerned for your situation. It’s escalating and he is such a powerful dog. He is currently giving you warning bites. What happens when it gets worse and he decides he has warned you or someone else enough? The dog needs a trainer/muzzle as soon as possible before anything more serious happens.

Edit: Your mom can muzzle train him. Once he is muzzle trained, there are private, at home trainer options that you can look into. This option seems like it would be worth it for your parents situation."

reactivedogs,f27sc3p,t3_dcbrq9,1570045062.0,Same thing happens with my dogs. I have to walk them separately. Your dog is over it’s stimulations threshold and is redirecting its frustration/anxiety on to the other dog because she is right there. You’ll need to work on redirecting her attention when in these situations and giving her a treat when she does not react to the stimulus. It’ll take time and it is best to walk them separately until you’ve worked through it.
