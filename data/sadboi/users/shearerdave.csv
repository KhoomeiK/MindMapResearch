I get so engrossed with my own delusions that I bypass depression. I experience tinnitus so whenever I isolate I either ruminate on my past or fantasize about the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 

A couple of days ago I came across a couple of pieces of information that's enabled me to get some perspective on my dysfunctional childhood. The first was "" zero sum games "" my parents would never admit to playing games like this. It's disheartening to think that is part of the reason I isolate. I just don't know how to relate to others without playing these kinds of games. I generally just become permissive. 

The second was a word I've heard before but didn't know could be a mood as well. That word is pugnacious. Something I introjected as a child. My mother lacked any sort of self awareness but this is how she related to others. When she was well she'd add her sexuality into the mix and act as though she was a princess in waiting. She thought she was schooled in all stately affairs. When she had a migraine though or no money it was gloves off.

It's why I isolate because like I said I don't know how to relate to others. When manic I just want to play zero sum games and sexualize with either males or females. It was all in my subconscious .

I don't find this stuff as depressing as I once did. I'm grateful to know that the problem is mine. I tell myself I'm not doing to bad for a red neck hick that was absolutely clueless a few years ago. I know the truth now.

I read on here a few days ago about experiencing flat affect. That's what i experience most of the time now. I thought that unless I had a zing in my step then I must be unwell. Screw that though.

I think that maybe my mission in life was to teach my parents patience and tolerance.  I think it's the same for the general population.

In trying to deal with early childhood trauma I've had therapists and councillors suggest learning to love your inner child. I guess I took that to the extreme and became completely self engrossed. The affect I experience would be similar to that of someone who is full of religious zeal. I have memory of being in this state of mind as a toddler.

I for the most part function out of this place. 
As a childhood I was the victim of a sadomasochistic game where as a result of it I ended up with a perforated eardrum. I have tinnitus as a result. It comes to the fore whenever I try and relax. Because I was so young, like four going on five, I just used fantasy as a means of circumventing the tinnitus. 
There has only been a handful of times where I can recall drifting off to sleep, the rest of the time I just wake up.
I still indulge in nicotine, it's a form of self soothing. On one particular occasion I was strapped for cash and went several hours without nicotine. I was feeling pretty good about myself so I went for a walk. This strange sensation came over me like I was leaving my body. Probably two years later I realized that that was dissociation. It frightened me. The feelings most people pursue in life trigger me. 
I was assaulted by my mother at the age of eighteen months for jumping up and down on a bed when I was meant to be having an afternoon nap. The feelings I experienced prior to her assault were divine. The ability to be able to defy gravity was sensational. It's taken me years to be able to talk in a coherent manner about it. I was in a frenzy of jubilation! It verged on rapture. All the grand feelings that norms rejoice in. I remember the pain and how I turned into the wall and hated the stinging away. Just before I passed out I recall that in my minds eye all that vibrant color associated with health and vitality winked out. Schism!!!
I could go on but this is the stuff that i take to a therapist. So I think being able to experience and name dissociation for what it is is moving in the right direction. I still want someone to hold my hand to walk me through the nicotine withdrawals."

It's known as a expansive delusion. I also love stimulants as in coke a cola and nicotine. I binged last night and was up till four in the morning. The positive thing was today I realized that it's a form of abuse. Deprivation ..... I neglect myself hoping that the windfall will come my way and I'll never be needy ever again. A flaming five driving the bus. Mentally and emotionally I never hit any developmental milestones from the age of five... maybe even younger. So when I come out of these interludes of schizoid fantasy I'm able to recognize it and not beat up on myself like self judgement. It's just a defense mechanism."

I attend 12th step meetings online and people have tried to reach out to me but I get negative or paranoid either way a divide developes and I insulate myself and I end up isolated again. I heard a guy share the other day and he says two hours max and then he's had enough of others. I feel guilty because sometimes I feel as though I've had enough after ten minutes. I have a savage inner critic ..... which I suppress, when that comes to the fore I slip into diplomacy were I become permissive and agreeable not wanting to rock the boat. I just accept as these maladaptive coping mechanisms have kept me alive for forty years. 12th step fellowships sicken me to at times as the champions are held in awe. I use to want to emulate them until I was diagnosed. All good here for today , take care"
