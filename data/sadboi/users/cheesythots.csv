edit: I read this backwards. My parents never had the sex talk with me. My most formative years were spent at a very conservative private school where abstinence was the only option. Looking back, I feel like I would have really benefited from it. I lost my virginity at a young age, and even as a 25 year old now, I still feel uncomfortable talking to my parents about relationships in general. Even though I feel like I have a decent relationship with my parents, I still feel like there‚Äôs a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask don‚Äôt tell‚Äù expectation with them. Not that I expect to give them the nitty gritty details, but even topics like moving in with a partner is a tough conversation.

When/if I have children, I just want to make sure they know they can come to me about anything without feeling like they‚Äôre getting in trouble."
Columbus,fov2sha,t3_g6zd91,1588094456.0,"I lived at Governours Square for a year after college in 2018. I never had any complaints. Management was always nice, maintenance requests were always responded to quickly, and I never felt unsafe. The proximity to the freeway is nice as well. The main reason we moved is that our rent was increased after only a year of living there, so make sure you talk to management about rent stability. Otherwise, I would recommend it!"
Columbus,fov1j2x,t1_foo87wn,1588093873.0,I second North Kenny! Their staff are incredibly kind and I never feel like they‚Äôre trying to gouge you for money.

AskReddit,feuxlvn,t3_eqies2,1579390979.0,"I work for an early childhood education program as a social worker. A couple days before the new year I stopped at one of the daycare centers I represent to meet with a new parent to enroll her kiddo. The parent didn‚Äôt show but I distinctly remember speaking with the parent on the phone and talking to the staff at the center. The following week I was going over the students attendance records and noticed that the daycare center had written that they were closed from Dec 24 until Jan 4. I figured it was a mistake since I remember being there and telling the staff ‚Äúhappy new year‚Äù before I left. I spoke with the supervisor of the center who confirmed with me that they had been closed those 2 weeks. I went back through my phone records and saw that I had called and text the parent I was supposed to meet with on Dec 31 about the appointment. In the text to her I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here at the center, will you be able to make it?‚Äù confirming that I had been there that day. 

When I tried to rationalize it I thought that maybe the center was closed for the children and the staff were there for a teacher work day, but I distinctly remember seeing parents pick up their kids that afternoon. I checked the attendance again and asked a staff member a few days later and still got the same answer, that they were closed. 

I still swear I was there when they were supposedly ‚Äúclosed.‚Äù I told my boss and her response was basically, ‚Äúhuh, weird.‚Äù Still confuses me a ton."

Dreams,f0glp5n,t3_d4oi4k,1568601822.0,ugh i hate this. I can NEVER run in dreams. If I‚Äôm trying to run away from something it feels like cinderblocks are attached to my feet and I can barely move. The only way I can run in a dream is if I hold on to someone who is also running. I hate it

CatAdvice,eumrzg0,t1_euml5ty,1563919699.0,i will def try this!! thank you!
CatAdvice,eukoixi,t1_euiyeh1,1563891118.0,"Ah yes, I forgot to mention Feliway. I tried this for the first couple months I had him. I do think it made him feel more comfortable in his new environment but I don‚Äôt believe it had any effect on his pooping problem unfortunately."
CatAdvice,eukoe50,t1_euixeo2,1563891069.0,"He absolutely hates pills and will fight tooth and nail to prevent me from giving them to him, but I may just have to try it. Thank you!!"
CatAdvice,euknlsa,t1_euiyl37,1563890759.0,"I will definitely try to buy him more stuff that will keep him occupied while I‚Äôm gone, but there‚Äôs really only so much I can do while working full time. I bought him a scratcher and a small tree but he doesn‚Äôt seem to be interested in either. I will keep trying those things in hopes that he comes around eventually. Thank you!"
CatAdvice,eukb7db,t1_euis84s,1563885925.0,I feel your pain. I‚Äôve definitely shed a few tears of frustration over this. If I make any progress I will definitely let you know!
CatAdvice,eukb0jo,t1_euinw6o,1563885852.0,I will definitely give the shelter a call today to see what kind of advice they have. I‚Äôm not sure they will be able to give me much info on his background though as I believe he was just surrendered to the shelter with no explanation. Thanks! I‚Äôll definitely update!
CatAdvice,euiepng,t1_euici1d,1563846188.0,"funny you say that, about 10 minutes ago I caught him in the act, taking a dump right on the stairs. I tried to pick him up and move him to the litter box but that just resulted in poop bombs all over the floor and him sprinting for his life the minute I put him in the box. I may have to find a behaviorist after all üôÉ"
CatAdvice,euiekwm,t1_eui003w,1563846111.0,"sigh, unfortunately I may just have to bite the bullet and do it.. hopefully I can find a good one for a decent price"
CatAdvice,euhz3jp,t1_euhy7qv,1563837053.0,"he‚Äôs pretty much been anxious since I got him. The shelter gave me 2 different stories, that he was a surrender/that he was found abandoned, so I‚Äôm really unsure as to what his background is. My guess is that he used to live in a home where he was neglected and so he pooped wherever he pleased. Not sure how to stop this behavior though. The shelter used to give him cat xanax but I really don‚Äôt feel comfortable giving that to him every day."
CatAdvice,euhxc6r,t1_euhwhjc,1563836034.0,"I have 2 large covered boxes. I used to have one covered one and one open one. He never used the open one and my vet suggested he might prefer privacy since a lot of times he will poop under my bed, in closets, behind furniture, etc. He used to exclusively use the one in my room which is the one I had when I first adopted him. Since I bought the other covered one that‚Äôs in the bathroom, he‚Äôs stopped using the one in my room altogether."

cats,ephcarl,t1_eperuwx,1559224953.0,same! one of the reasons he stood out so much!
cats,epep7a4,t1_epec45l,1559185377.0,I‚Äôm actually not sure. I adopted him about 4 months ago! But now that you say that I can definitely see it.
