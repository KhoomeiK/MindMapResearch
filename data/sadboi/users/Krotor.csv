> 
> Serfdom was a norm in Europe since something like 8th Century, last serfs/slaves were released here (N-Europe) 1860-s. In my country majority of population were either outright slaves or serfs from the beginning of 13th Century up to 1863. There were regions in Russian Empire were Slavery wasn't abolished before 1890-s..
> 
> Ottomans had slavery, it's literally taken as ""normal way of things"" in Qu'ran.
> 
> Romans had slavery, ancient Athenians with their democracy did have slavery.
> 
> Where did the Dutch slavetraders get their slaves? African tribes fought each-other, have always been and will do in the future.. and took slaves they re-sold to Arabs or Europeans..
> 
> Just way should some American think that THEY in particular are responsible for slavery in general, honestly blows my mind..
