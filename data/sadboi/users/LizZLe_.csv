helpme,fqwv3o5,t3_gld5go,1589718542.0,"Yes, your ways of thinking are a bit weird and mean, BUT i can kind of understand it. Not because theyre always true, but because youve been cheated on. Take a break and work on yourself and get to know yourself better. When the time is right you might find someone who does treat you right and dont rush things if you think like this! Get to know someone better before projecting these misogynistic thoughts onto them.
It is a good thing that you know that you think like that. Now you have the time to work on yourself. 
Please treat women well tho, just because your ex was like this does not mean everyone is like this"
