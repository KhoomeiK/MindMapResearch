I think you nailed it.  The fact that they're a gay couple was seriously a non-issue, not even discussed on the show among the characters, iirc. Their relationship just did not stand out in any way... other than David being David.  ;)

I remember an interview with Dan Levy and he said that was intentional, that they were not going to have the other townies comment or judge them as a gay couple and I think they executed this flawlessly."

I can't think of the right word right now... but just... normal, everyday or something, not in a flamboyant, caricature-esque gay kind of way.

Their characters really just *normalize* it and make it so not a big deal, as if it were the most natural thing there is.  I'm sure it made it much easier to swallow for viewers who are typically less comfortable with LGBT."
