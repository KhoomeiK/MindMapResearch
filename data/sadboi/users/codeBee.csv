keto,fcwty2r,t1_fcvw9nq,1578037491.0,Are you still on the keto diet?
keto,fcvul1r,t1_fbwjd9p,1578010445.0,Why did you have to taper off aggressively?
benzorecovery,fbxxsfg,t1_fbxrblr,1577203253.0,"> propranolol
Thank you. Can I ask, when you were tapering, were you on a ketogenic diet?"
benzorecovery,fbxcrom,t1_fbxc8d7,1577180467.0,"Before that I took Sobril(Oxazepam) 5mg/day a few times a week for half a year (short acting, comparable to 2.5mg Valium).

I tried stopping Xanax Extended release a month ago, that I had been taking for a few days. It went horribly. Ended up on Valium. So I am really hesitant to stop fast."
keto,fbxat57,t1_fbwi6au,1577177489.0,I've heard Keto can make alcohol have more effect on you. Is that true? I thought maybe it was the same with benzos. I saw some research where it was theorized that [Keto has some effect on something connected to Gaba  in your brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2722878/). I've also heard that both alcohol and benzos have some effect connected to Gaba. But I don't know much about this.
keto,fbxa76o,t1_fbwi6au,1577176597.0,Are you sure?  I haven't started lowering my dose yet. I've been on a low dose for not so long and am starting to have some issues
keto,fbx9znl,t1_fbwfw2w,1577176288.0,"I'm taking 5mg Valium each day total. In 3 different doses. To keep things simple: I have been taking equivalent dose to that for roughly a month.

I haven't started my taper. Still I'm waking up with a pounding heart and sometimes my anxiety and uneasiness is pretty bad."
Anxiety,fbwfbr5,t3_eerhdv,1577148419.0,I'm so proud of you. This can be so hard for so many people. I so hope I will be able to quit as well!!
depression,fahwmyu,t3_e8wf5e,1576095027.0,"
I think you are strong to be able to be alone like that. I don't think I could do it.

I am with my family. But I am in such a bad place that it is really difficult to enjoy their company. I feel alone, and that my situation is so difficult that no one understands. But if I would truly be alone, I would panic."
MushroomSupplements,fahwk4g,t1_fahuqwz,1576094980.0,"Orthostatic intolerance (OI) is the development of symptoms when standing upright which are relieved when reclining. And that is definately what was happening. I didn't feel tired or anything. Just felt a very weird feeling inside of me that got more and more intolerable the longer I was standing. It got to the point that I couldn't raise my head to watch a movie without it becoming intolerable, except for a few minutes.

I put it in alcohol because I thought that is how I make an extract like that. I have no idea how it should be done. I just had a foolish confidence and thought that is how it is done. I don't remember, but I think I saw some youtube videos and followed them.

I have added the dosages I took. I took equivalent to 1 gram each day of Lions Mane powder + Alcohol.

I wasn't taking anything else. This  Orthostatic Intolerance has completely gone away by now.

I wasn't taking any other substances at that time."
MushroomSupplements,fahannd,t1_fah9wrj,1576082570.0,"I don't know how much it is. But yes what I used was dry.
I started taking it because I felt my memory was a little bad. And sometimes I had difficulty recalling words.  
My inability to sit up straight was something not conneced to my issues. But it doesn't have to be connected to my use of Lion's Mane either."
depression,fah82f6,t3_e97egy,1576081209.0,This is so true. But there are other reasons. For example people with very bad Akathisia. [This poor woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byFP0lZSdR4) was like this all the time basically. She sadly gave up.
self,fah6m8e,t3_e93u9l,1576080318.0,I'm not really alone. But am in a bad place and it's difficult to enjoy their company :(
benzorecovery,fa0ex2u,t3_e34n3i,1575754083.0,"I am the author of this thread. An update: I think this was all a bad bad mistake by me. I think you should follow your tapering plan even if you feel good. These drugs are strange and come back to bite me in strange ways. Now I'm a mess. But I don't know what is withdrawal, and what is my own psychological problems. My family and doctors say I'm not in withdrawal.

I like [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/e34n3i/what_if_i_feel_fine_and_dont_feel_like_i_need_to/f90vujw/)"
