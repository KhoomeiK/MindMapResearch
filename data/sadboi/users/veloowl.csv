emotionalneglect,fpkib33,t3_gbguqd,1588695199.0,"Hi all,

This past week has been tough. I keep getting triggered by my partner, through no fault of her own at all, which just makes it all worse because I feel so ashamed about it. She's struggling with her own stuff, and when I see her expressing sorrow about it, it sends me into a tailspin because for whatever reason, I feel responsible for it. It's like stepping on an IED of guilt, rage, shame and despair. Honestly, her sadness could literally have *nothing* to do with me whatsoever, and I respond as if my mother just told me I ruined her life by being born. My mother never said that to me, but she was very good at leveling her Catholic guilt at me when she needed to.  
   
Even though I've talked about this at length in therapy, I still struggle to identify or relate to my own experience of emotional neglect because if was mostly neglect by omission, not commission. It's hard to know what you should've gotten when you didn't get it and just assumed that everyone didn't get it, if that makes any sense at all. 

Like many of us, I never wanted for anything in terms of food, shelter, etc.. What I didn't get was much of what children need to grow up into more-or-less functioning adults with a enough of a level of well-being that they're generally content and feel good. My life has been nearly completely hijacked by the psychological symptoms. Starting at age 23: horrendous bouts of anxiety, panic, despair, depression and an intolerable, almost alien blend of brain fog and anhedonia where I experience long stretches of feeling horrifically detached from myself, my interests, my appetites and any pleasure whatsoever. Even the smallest thing, like the spark of joy I normally get from seeing my cat, gone. It's like my reward center is taken offline. 

So, it's helpful to hear other people's stories on forums like this. It's validating and makes me feel like less of a total freak. I hope I can also be of some help to others here.   


Thanks for reading."
CPTSD,fph6opo,t3_gb4m7l,1588615918.0,"This is kind of amazing. I've been listening to this book here and there for the past couple of years, and for some reason, I never really clicked with me. Then, I just started listening to it again from the beginning. I don't know why, but only now am I realizing that Walker's description of an emotional flashback is ***exactly*** what happens to me in certain situations...for example, my wife will ask me a question about something that I am extremely conflicted about, and I will *instantly* devolve into an implosion of rage, fear, self-hatred, toxic shame and guilt. I can't talk, I can't move, I basically curl up into a ball and want to disappear. Why this didn't click with me before I have no idea.

Curious to know, what do think was missing in the therapy you've done in the past? Did it not ever touch on trauma? Or was the therapist not qualified to analyze and treat you? I've been in therapy for years, but it's really only recently that a therapist told me, ""you are traumatized in a very significant way."""

Then, eventually, it turns into this fucking hell of disconnection called anhedonia. So, I know the pattern, which I guess is good, but I have no way of preventing the end result.

For me, generally, fighting these thoughts and feelings makes the war worse, and when the conflict gets worse, so does the anxiety. 

At the same time, to not defend myself against these attacks with objective truth feels like just letting myself get abused. If a bully walks up to me and sucker punches me, my most immediate reaction is to give the bastard a taste of its own medicine and smack it back twice as hard. But of course, that just leads back to the original bind of resisting -> increased conflict -> anxiety/depression symptoms. It‚Äôs hard, but anything worth doing is, right?

InternalFamilySystems,foqyvaz,t1_fop5zzk,1588003230.0,"Thank you again for your feedback. Yes, there's no question I'm blended with many parts. The despising part despises the anxiety much like a person despises another who punches them in the face everyday. It's kind of hard to feel compassion for the face puncher. It's very much victim vs perpetrator, and my hatred of, and attempts to get relief from, the face puncher is an attempt to provide protection from the puncher. Of course, there is no other person, just another part of myself. 

Your explanations make complete sense, thank you again. I look forward to really hearing and learning what my protectors have to say about those they protect. For someone new to IFS, you certainly have an impressive depth of knowledge of it. I also look forward to any updates you provide on your ongoing explorations with it. 

Gratitude."
InternalFamilySystems,fondxek,t1_fon4s12,1587917631.0,"I can‚Äôt thank you enough to taking the time to respond to me. And thank you for clarifying the difference between a hurt part and a protector part. I believe my protector part is the one that is hateful, resentful and pushes away in a attempt to protect another part.

My biggest challenge is my symptoms of panic, anxiety and depression, and my *incredible frustration* at the torment of these feeling states. I despise them. They have had a seriously damaging impact on my life and relationships. They don‚Äôt even feel like emotions as such. They feel like symptoms in the way that drug use or porno addiction are symptoms. And I have zero control of it. Best I can do it take a benzo when it gets overwhelming. And I can spend weeks and weeks at some level of these symptoms, during which I rarely feel and of the C‚Äôs of Self. And that just feeds on itself. So when I‚Äôm feeling these symptoms, I feel they may be more the result of the war between my various parts than parts themselves, if that makes any sense.

I do see a therapist, and we are working on mapping out the parts and protectors very carefully and painstakingly. This is going to take a long time, I believe I suffer from some kind of PTSD.

Again, thank you so much again. I‚Äôll post hear again as things progress, and try also to give back in anyway can to this helpful forum. I have also bookmarked your post because revisiting it will be helpful to me.

It‚Äôs a kind of enraged child who is refusing to ‚Äúgrow up‚Äù and/or change or accept reality as it is, and instead engages in fantasy as a way of coping.

InternalFamilySystems,fo6dep8,t3_g5qcte,1587555487.0,"I was in psychodynamic therapy for over a decade, and while it was helpful in me understanding many many things, including the idea of a false self or a self identified with a parent as opposed to my ‚Äútrue‚Äù self, nothing ever changed for me. I still have the same debilitating anxiety that I had a decade ago. Is this because I wasn‚Äôt able to have a healing attachment to my therapist that would somehow help me become my true self, thereby ending my symptoms? Maybe. And if it‚Äôs true that what really brings healing is not the modality but the relationship with the therapist, wouldn‚Äôt that make the modality almost irrelevant?

I take your point about IFS‚Äôs Self idea that once you become unblended, what‚Äôs left is some kind of zen-like Ekhart Tolle figure. And the 8Cs often sounds like some kind of marketing thing to me, and It often seems far fetched. At the same time, over a decade of talking about my dreams, taking about my unconscious and taking endlessly about my family did literally nothing for my anxiety.

To his credit, he does counter that this is not the case and that I'm in charge of my own experience. Still, when I brought up the idea of working with a different therapist, he didn't actually offer his support or thoughts about it. Instead, he pointed out how I felt I needed his support in order to investigate such a thing. Which is a fair point and worth talking about.

TalkTherapy,fjd3zll,t1_fjcwswi,1583245100.0,"Thank you. Unfortunately, my requests to discuss goals, progress or my feelings of confusion are rarely met with actual answers, just more analysis of the questions. I can see some value in analyzing the motivations, etc, behind questions, but when the client is been distressed for a long time, how about some support in the form of clarity."
TalkTherapy,fjcuxug,t1_fjcl943,1583237600.0,"Thanks for this feedback. It‚Äôs good to know I‚Äôm not alone. There are times when I wonder of this has done more harm than good. My meeting yesterday was another frustrating, confusing, circular shitshow of a session when all I wanted was some clear feedback and some answers. It was not helpful in the least."
TalkTherapy,fjcupkd,t1_fjc7vgo,1583237361.0,"Thank you so much for this feedback. I recently had a consult with a female therapist because I was feeling so frustrated and lost in my current therapy. She had a warmth and compassion about her that my therapist does not have, and she was clear in her responses and explanations. I left feeling heard and understood as opposed to leaving feeling like a frustrated basket case. I think I may see her again as a possible replacement. I don‚Äôt want a hug at the end of sessions and I don‚Äôt need my T to self disclose in order for me to feel connected, but the blank slate thing has not worked for me.

Thanks again for you reply."
InternalFamilySystems,fj7nbkl,t3_fbmnns,1583094108.0,"My sense is that as you work through the parts that are in conflict with your Self or with one another, you kind of gradually turn down the volume on the internal war inside you, thereby lessening your triggers and the symptoms they create (panic, anxiety, depression, various behaviors, etc). I know that doesn‚Äôt really answer your question, and I‚Äôm still in the beginning stages of IFS therapy myself. But I‚Äôm with you, I want to know what skills I‚Äôll end up with the deal with this stuff In the moment."

‚Ä¢ I don‚Äôt understand existence: CHECK

‚Ä¢ I scared I‚Äôm loosing my mind: CHECK

‚Ä¢ I feel like I will never be normal again: CHECK

‚Ä¢ I don‚Äôt even remember what I was like before: CHECK

‚Ä¢ everything feels very dream-like and fake: More like wearing a diving bell on my head. Super head foggy.

‚Ä¢ I feel trapped in my head and the world: CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK +1000 

‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt deal with what‚Äôs around me or what‚Äôs inside of me: CHECK

‚Ä¢ it feels like my brain might break: CHECK...already feels broken 

I‚Äôll add that I feel like a total basket case most of the time, making everything difficult: work, travel, relationships. You‚Äôre not alone, friend."

InternalFamilySystems,fill7b7,t1_fikhd28,1582504193.0,"@AufDerGalerie, thanks so much for this information. I am about 3 chapters into More Than The Sum...I‚Äôve been struggling with the visualization exercises but I found his chapter on how he formulated IFS very helpful and accessible. I love how he says the goal is for people to be their own attachment figures since so many people had ZERO ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù attachment figures in their lives.

But There is a part of me...literally a part...that is afraid that this approach isn‚Äôt...isn‚Äôt *something* for a person as messed up as me. When I‚Äôm plagued by these intrusive thoughts and the panic they induce, I feel like the most mentally screwed up person who ever lived. I‚Äôm hoping I can change this. I do know that I have separate parts.

Thank you again."

For me it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a voice in my head that says, for example, ‚Äúwhat if I actually hated my mom.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI hate my mom‚Äù or ‚ÄúYOU hate your mom.‚Äù The truth is that I love my mom and I know this, but the intrusive thought says the opposite: ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt love your mom, you hate her.‚Äù And this a what kicks off my anxiety."
