I wake up, my whole body aches from total inflammation. My first mental jab is my father. He's emotionally neglected me and I blame half on him and half on me for my whole life being the way it is ( him because my upbringing, me because I don't change). Me and my mum are discussing going to the doctor and he mentions ""It's because he's fat"" 

Now I'm going to be a bit diva and say I look fucking good for a 90s kg bastard (idk how much muscle). I yell at him, saying that that might be true, but how are you helping me. My relationship with him has always been horrible, mainly because everything bad about me reminds of the fact I'm just like him. 

I go to college full of people from the same type of neighbourhoods as me. Lower middle class. 
Everyone is a ""My days been bad so I'm going to look sulky so someone comes to my side."" I'll admit, I was like that, but even for me, that's an embarrassment. My friend struggles with ptsd to the point I can't crack Christmas crackers with him for obvious reasons and he goes into a state where he goes quiet and grabs a weapon-like object. It really taxes on my mental health, because I'm just a cog in this huge sad machine. I wish my class was normal so I could be normal. 

I come home to usually my old man on the couch and TV. I hike upstairs with my Instruments, ""Sophie"" The Bass Guitar, and an electric guitar that's got no name as of yet. Then I waste my life on YouTube because it exhausts me to even do things I enjoy. Imagine. Being to tired to do things you love. 

I night I go through an internal rant about my upbringing and society. How nobody is a decent person, how my family was broken from the start, how I have 0 support groups (Yes, my parents arent a support group to me, because they're confrontational about everything, which makes my anger issues flare). My beast-like primal rage makes me lose it and hit a wall or two. 

I just don't want to be alone. I just want somebody to be my cheerleader when I accomplish anything no matter how simple. I want to be loved my ANYONE, not even romantically."

Nobody ever talks about how the happiest person ever can kill themselves over time. It's also why they don't believe I'm depressed.
