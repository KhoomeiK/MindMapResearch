OCD,f3c67uq,t3_dgha4g,1570820282.0,"Been there. One step at a time & ride the wave--the anxiety will be there whether you wash for 10 seconds or 10 minutes. OCD is so fking hard and so many people have misguided thoughts on what the struggle is. Believe in yourself. I am 30 and have been dealing-mostly struggling- for the majority of my life with stuff like this. Believe in yourself--my mind is constant OCD and questioning/fearing whether i did small tasks right and if i didnt, are my irrational fears going to come to fruition. The thoughts-for me- will mostly always be there. The key is to not engage with these thoughts. Its fking hard, but be confident that down deep you have the tools to overcome and you have the tools to live life the way you wish to live your life. OCD sucks so much. It is not bigger than me. It is not bigger than you. You've got this."
