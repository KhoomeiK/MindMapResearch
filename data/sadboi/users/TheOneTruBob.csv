https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-conditions-of-US-prisons-in-the-19th-century

(I tried to find PDFs but couldn't. The first 2 books I that search seem to have tons of info for you based on the previews I found)

Something interesting about this time period is that if the work were far from a town back then, a lot of jobs like this would have had a residence outside for workers, which could consist of barracks or even small houses so the guards could live near their work  (less sure about this so if someone says otherwise go with them) 

Anyway, good luck, and hopefully my google-fu can help you out."

TheMonkeysPaw,fpyvw2r,t1_fpxp3f1,1589009760.0,"That's a good question. The US was created in 1881 under the articles of confederation and had [several](https://www.jjmccullough.com/earlypresidents.htm) presidents under those articles. George washington wasn't president until 1889 after they had thrown out the first constitution. You could (and some do) even make the argument that he [wasn't even the first President of the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hanson) but by 1889 they had had a decade of bickering to gauge how the states treated each other. You could argue that civil war would have happened MUCH sooner had they not rewritten our founding documents to give a bit more focus and power to the federal government. 

That being said The American Civil War didn't happen until 1860/61 but by the early 1800's There was enough tension that people worried. The north wasn't very good to the south (slavery aside, and not to imply the south was pure in any way) for a long time simply because their economies were so different. The South was primarily agricultural, and the north was focused on manufacturing, and since all the power at the time was concentrated in places like Boston, Philadelphia, and New York, there were a lot of protectionist laws and tariffs that helped the north and hurt the south, creating even more tension. That's why moving the capitol from New York to DC (the middle of the country at the time) was so important.

Then again that tension was how we got shit like the 3/5 compromise, the south wanted 1/1 voting for slaves (even though slaves were property in their eyes and not citizens) and the North wanted zero votes for a slave because counting slave votes would unbalance the voting blocks in a pretty unfair way (Immagine your owner using your ""vote"" to keep you a slave), but the south threatened to secede, so they compromised to preserve the union. Not our proudest moment to be sure, but it ~~stopped~~ postponed a war.

IANAH but from my reading and one college level history class, as far as I can tell they knew there would be a civil war eventually one way or another, but compromises were made, both good and bad, to postpone it long enough for the fledgeling country to survive such a war."

However the social impact alone may have been worth the money. Factor in the cost of reconstruction and the loss of lives in America and it's a tough call.

I used loophole hyperbolically, but apparently it was still completely legal at the time, and he did actually free 5 slaves in his will, but the other **130** were sold to settle estate debts, so you are correct that when he died they stood as property against his debt.

In hindsight it's easy to say just do it, but slavery was a millennia old institution at that point and touched every aspect of the economy. No one really knew how ending it would pan out. It would be like trying to end the use of oil in a year.

The American civil war was costly in both men and treasure, and created no goodwill for reintegration with the south. Lincoln had some plans for that, but they went up when booth shot him.

Personally I think the Brits had the best idea with The Crown paying off the owners and trying to reintegrate the ex slaves. The outcomes were much better, if not perfect, and by the numbers, much less costly than a war, even though they spent the next several decades paying it off.

Does he want out as well or does he consider the player a traitor? Did they serve together or separately, and what were their relative ranks before and after? There's also the aspect of how the contact feels about their relationship with the player and how interacts with his feelings about the player leaving.  Options include

Contact remembers PC fondly but is mad he left, but can't turn in someone he grew up with

Player was the best commander the contact ever had, and feels betrayed and left behind when the player left.

Contact also wants out and would like the players help to harm the empire. (Results ranging from gaining a new helper to a glorious death.)

Contact hates the empire as a whole, but took an oath and is super pissed the player betrayed his own oath. Maybe he looked at the player as a son he never had and feels betrayed as well.

Contact loves the empire and would trick the PC into thinking he wants to help but betrays them (Be very careful with this one. Only use it if the player has had successful contact results. Betrayal can be fun but it it's their first time using an ability, it will feel like you're trying to shut them down.) 

They were adversarial in their youth, and doesn't know the player is out. Maybe the contact feels isolated in his empire post and could really use someone to be on their side.

Maybe they were friends but the player stole this guy's girlfriend on his way out. She's no longer in the picture, so where does that leave the relationship?

Go crazy man, just remember that the player wants to feel cool and connected to the universe you are running, so however you handle it, if you make sure their character is involved in the backstory, they will probably be happy with the result. Don't overthink it, just a simple backstory that involves the two of them and then how the friend 
would likely feel about seeing the player after all this time.

EDIT: Reread your post, The Contact could be a Rebel Spy that heard about the player and seeks him out. Could still have any of the above ideas on top of that, but this might be an easy way to make contact with the Alliance. Just a thought."
FATErpg,fnba2yz,t3_g0r4nm,1586811870.0,"I would do a simple roll to see if they knew anyone, or if they had a good reason to know someone on the starbase then just give it to them. And then a separate roll, maybe behind the screen to see if they had any useful information.

Also consider how long it's been since they knew the person. What does the contact look like after they haven't seen them in a decade. Do they remember them fondly? Was it a bad breakup, were they on different sides previously? How might a decade of working for the empire change someone for good or ill? Just because you know a guy doesn't mean he knows what you wish they did, or that they're going to be happy to see the PC."
