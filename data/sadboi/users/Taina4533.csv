So yeah, if someone goes out onto a public space without a mask, even if they’re properly distancing from others, they should be at least told off and sent home until they can get a face covering.

And I didn’t even sit them down, I just told them separately when we were alone in the car. I didn’t even tell them I was anything specific, I just said “hey, I have a crush on [person of my same sex]”. My dad took it really well. He didn’t look exited or anything, he just went “you do you, you’re my daughter and I love you and you can love whoever you want”. My mom still kind thinks it’s temporary because my crush for this person has dwindled (even though I’m still gay as all hell)l but whatever. She isn’t butting in. As for the rest of my family, they really don’t need me to tell them unless they ask. So yeah. Never made a big deal out of it, just put it out slowly.
