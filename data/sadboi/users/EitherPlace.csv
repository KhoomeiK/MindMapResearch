It seems like, without that, there can be no objective arbiter of truth in their field.

I don‚Äôt follow any particular diet, but I do eat very little sugar or processed carbohydrates (bread, pasta, etc). I also live with a strict religious vegetarian (Hindu), who won‚Äôt allow cooking meat at the house. The result of all this (in addition to a strong dispositional tendency) is that I have turned to butter, cheese, and sometimes coconut oil as a major source of calories and my preferred way of making things taste good. For example, I use heavy cream to make lattes at home and I usually eat vegetables simmered in butter and covered in a thick layer of cheese. For as long as I can remember, I have craved comical quantities of high-fat dairy. Everyone likes dairy, but in my case it‚Äôs just more extreme. And now that I make my own food, don‚Äôt eat much meat, and avoid sugar/processed carbs, it has become even more ridiculous. Is this a problem, and how can I moderate it?
