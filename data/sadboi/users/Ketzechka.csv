TheArcana,fqzp2hv,t1_fqy2n1m,1589772140.0,"Preach! I hate how the writers plop every bad thing onto Lucio when some doesn't make any sense and then have the audacity to turn around and make him incompetent. It's like ""How many negative things can I shit onto this character without having them contradict each other?"" Truth is they've crossed that line and Lucio feels like a completely different character in all 6 routes. They thought they could have their cake and eat it too with making Lucio both a big threat and complete moron.   
I honestly wish they stuck to the Machiavellian type we got shown in the old prologue before they deleted it. He was scary and threatening but even so just from the way he acted you could tell he just wanted company. A possible redemption arc would've been more interesting because it would allow for more ""Will this dude actually be redeemed? how many of my other friends will I have to sacrifice in the process of making this work because they don't want anything to do with him?"" Meanwhile in his route all the characters are like ""yep! ok guess lucio is good now and dating the apprentice w/e."" And despite the thing they're trying to go for with the ""will he or won't he become selfless/change?"" it has the subtlety of a brick when you know Lucio will not show the manipulating cunning his character was supposed to have and thus have the ability to turn MC against their friends. 

  
I feel like they tried to appeal to too many people with his redemption arc and ended up pleasing no one in the process. At least his latest chapter was a step up.

OMG I'd loooove that, and was thinking that too. I always wondered how Catwoman would react to/interact with Batman Who Laughs because she was dead in the source material so we never got to see that.

Maybe it's a ""take me with you"" kind of thing where Catwoman betrays everyone to go join him, though I doubt the showrunners would go that deep. Maybe make it a foil to Harley's past relationship to the Joker. Also would be a funny take on how big bad villains always seem to have their ""right hand cat"" that they pet while revealing their evil plots.  


Did the showrunners ever say that her relationship to Batman will appear to be her ""weakness"" or are you just inferring? because that'd be an amazing take."

>If you really wanna lean in on the fact Lucio is a villain, make it so  he's corrupting MC from the start. Make so MC gets more and more  uncaring, and upright ending Lucio gets to come back to life and ruins  Vesuvia with MC by his side, reversed ending, MC kills Lucio for good,  saving Vesuvia, but losing their love.

Reversed end should never result in the death of either MC or Lucio. They're supposed to be bittersweet and still have you at your LI's side in the end.I feel like his reversed end will have him become his awful villain self and MC will become the Devil and basically take over Vesuvia/the world both for and with him, like Nadia's reversed but with roles switched. This has already been hinted at with Lucio saying in response to you saying you'll protect him in his last chapter, and I quote,  ""What if... you took my soul? Then I'd be safe, and I'd be all yours. Just out of curiosity...what would I get for giving you my soul?"" and MC answering, ""Whatever you want. As long as you ask nicely.""If done right, this could be an astounding reversed end. Well, the reversed ends always seem more interesting than the upright ones at least to me, but I digress.

You can make it alot different than Nadia's reversed end by emphasizing what happens as a result of MC becoming the Devil. How it corrupts them, how awful Lucio becomes, how it affects your relationships with everyone else, their reactions to seeing you betray them, the effects it has on the world. Because Nadia's didn't show that. We didn't get to see the awful aftermath. Unlike Nadia's reversed which ended with her being the Devil and starting to enter the human world, we can start Lucio's reversed end that way. Hell, to emphasize MC's newfound power give us the option to kill people. Make us so obsessed with protecting Lucio and giving him everything that our friends ""stand in our way"" and we get rid of them. Give us the perspective of the Devil. A really dark, fucked up end.

However, the Lucio writer doesn't seem to like writing angst or the other characters so we'll see.

> The Lucio we are getting just doesn't really seem like the Lucio we hear  about. That Lucio grew up in a warrior clan, led a mercenary crew,  somehow became a count (how!!???) and either was decent at it or had the  wherewithal to surround himself with decent enough people  (read:Valerius) to run vesuvia well enough that, like, half the  population likes him. It's never expounded on what all his myriad deals  were - they could've spent several chapters on those and figuring out  loopholes / fighting the demons or spirits. The devil plot was  practically tossed away when it is central to the main three's plots.  All the other characters are way too blasé about him being around -  especially Asra. They, of all people, should be shaking the MC every  chance they get, going, ""what is wrong with you?!""

TheArcana,fhjptr6,t3_f32nim,1581652294.0,"I REALLY liked this chapter but it felt short, as have his previous chapters. As much as I'm enjoying the route so far, it feels like they could be doing so much more with it, going so much deeper. Like, he's one of the main villains! There's so much more to be explored. I really hope the rest of the chapters make up for this fact.   
MC and him are compared both in his route and the other ones alot, I hope that gets explored more. I hope his reversed end is more than just him being evil again. I want us to....change too. I want our bond to be explored more. (Now that he's alive again do we still have the blood bond?) I want more of the arcana and the fool's journey. Also our apprentice's reaction to their death was really surface level, I REALLY hope it gets brought up again. We just went to angsty lazaret to baking cookies????? I feel like they should've talked about it more. I also want an interaction where asra gets mad at us/lucio!!!!! He's been really chill and it just seems....anticlimactic???   
I feel like there's so much hate for both him as a character and his route from both haters and stans alike and it makes me sad! I guess this community is kinda toxic but I'm tired of always being simultaneously disappointed with how short and surface level his chapters are, and how much HATE comes from fans/haters. The devs don't deserve it, but I really do hope that they're giving the same attention to his route as they are the other ones, because....it really doesn't seem like they are. 

Some lucio stans are disappointed with how he's being portrayed, but i don't really have a response for that. This is the real him. I think I guess people just want him to be more...evil?  
Sorry for this mess of ideas I'm just really passionate about the character :("
TheArcana,fhjck3p,t1_fhh5ebe,1581642826.0,"I don't think this is it, though maybe it is? Maybe the devs just updated it on one and not the other?

TheArcana,fgrnkqs,t1_fgq66hp,1581051611.0,"The manor is definitely hers, she's not borrowing it like she claimed she was.   
I saw this very good theory that Tasya is the moon arcana patron because she represents the moon tarot, link here: [https://angelsnhufflepuffs.tumblr.com/post/190132711446/who-is-baroness-anastasia-devorak](https://angelsnhufflepuffs.tumblr.com/post/190132711446/who-is-baroness-anastasia-devorak)  
Personally I first thought she would become the devil because like you said, we don't have any human representing the devil. While seeing the text of her announcement, it was the same font as Death's, so I thought she became the death arcana because her goal was to get rid of death, and the death arcana is too weakened by valdemar to even have a body, meaning they might have been an easy weak link to exploit. Link above provides very strong evidence for the moon. So, I'm not quite sure which it is???"

TheArcana,fgklyef,t1_fgjuy5s,1580868622.0,"Lucio doesn't seem to have known the apprentice from before. The parts about him 'knowing' them is from what he's seen/heard of them around the palace. He reveals this in his own route. He doesn't give any hint to having known us prior to that. I don't think Lucio would've known or cared about a medical apprentice working under Julian, and if he did 'know' of them he probably didn't ever see them personally or connect the dots later. In Lucio's upright the apprentice will definitely free him from his bonds.
The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced MC becoming the devil is the best Lucio reversed end idea."

I really like your idea of MC as the devil and Lucio as the fool, I was thinking something similar where Lucio becomes the devil but agrees to stay with us in the magical realms and Apprentice is in their full Fool arcana form, so they kinda forget their friends and they both aren't human anymore.  
Or something similar where we transform into the fool arcana and free lucio from his debts as long as he agrees to stay with us in the fool's realm forever, similar to how the hanged man offered julian to stay in his realm forever and never make a decision. This is a good reversed because as long as lucio stays immortal he never conquers his fear of death, meanwhile we're still isolated from everyone else in the magical realms and are fools forever. I made a post about this a while back, haha. You can read it if you'd like.  
Really I like all 3 of these ideas. Devil!Lucio would've been my favorite by how messed up they could make it, highlighting his worst evil traits. This would also satisfy our need for unhealthy angst rather than manchild mayhem XD. This would satisfy the MANY who are into devil!Lucio, however i doubt they're gonna do this cuz devil nadia was a thing. I was thinking he kills Morga to complete the devil ritual but maybe also MC is dead sorta? Or just their soul is separate from their body in the magical realms and Asra comes across this and is ready to go and try to kill Lucio. Meanwhile MC is with Lucio in the devil's realm or the magical realms and they're more 'powerful' and they choose to stay powerful with lucio. (Because the choices that lead to reversed also are with an MC taking on lucio's cocky traits.) So far his route has been meh, so to really turn it around with a reversed end like that would be amazing. I didn't play nadia's reversed end yet so maybe I'll come up with more later. PLUS, I think many people would love to be evil with him in his route. Fiddle as Rome burns type of thing. I think with how he is in his route MC is gonna be the devil with him as the fool, but the other way around would've been hot lol. I'm pretty sure MC frees Lucio of his debts in the other routes so i don't think they would need to become the devil to accomplish that.  
I think in Lucio's upright he's going to have to make a heroic self sacrifice or something to truly redeem himself and show he's changed. They could make it very sweet. Then MC and Lucio can go live a nice humble domestic life on the outskirts of Vesuvia with Mercedes and Melchoir."

I don't miss friends if I don't see them for weeks though. I don't really hang out with people cause I constantly forget, and scheduling is difficult and oftentimes people are out of sight out of mind, so I don't. It doesn't bother me that much and doesn't affect how close I feel to people, even if I don't see them for months to a year, but I'm kinda lonely most of the time. I mean, I look at how often my friends hang with other people or go places and I'm like damn! Imagine being able to coordinate hanging out and actually making sure to catch up with people, lol.

Adhd is handy for not missing people after a breakup or something like that tho, I guess. Idk. I love cutting people out of my love very easily and never thought of them again but sometimes I do miss people(another commentor mentioned codependent relationships and I think that hit the nail on the head.
