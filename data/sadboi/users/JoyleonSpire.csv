I think you should just ignore your family's thought, it's one: none of their business, and two: actual family wouldn't treat family that way... and then I think you should look into therapy to help you learn that you are more then you see yourself as and also help you discover yourself.

WeightLossAdvice,f8bf8jo,t3_e01tlo,1574435450.0,"I'm 235 lbs at 5'5"" , I use to binge eat, but my appetite has pretty much disappeared for various reasons for the past 10 years or so to the point where on a normal day I can struggle to get 700 to 900 calories a day. 

Since I was already obese when this started when I went into starvation mode my body would store anything I ate into fat for survival, and when I had normal eating days or a rare i feel like an empty hole and am able to eat equaling a binge day I would still store it into fat since it was never long enough to come out of starvation... So it's harder for me to actually lose weight even though I'm not eating enough. 

I think most people connect not eating a lot with anorexia and then anorexia with skin and bones thin, so they dont understand a fat person that honestly doesnt eat a whole lot and still being fat. 

She also might be binging when eyes aren't on her. Going from not eating a lot to eating a lot like I do, but you just might not see it. There is a lot of shame sometimes when it comes to being bigger and food. I know i have a little bit of that. It's not the first or second, and recently not even the third reason I'm like this, but there is a ""If I eat this they will judge me because I'm fat"" way of thinking. 

But none the less she should see a doctor and/or a nutritionist and tell them her eating habits and let them decide if she has other symptoms and want to run tests to see if anything is going on.

EUGENIACOONEY,f77l2tm,t1_f77hh7r,1573462175.0,"They didnt mean that she was using heroine, they were making a comparison on recovering. You dont go to rehab for 30 days and stay off heroine, just like you dont go to rehab for ED's and all of the sudden are fully recovered. 

And Taylor isnt in the middle of relapsing. Her not posting on social media is a good sign on my opinion. She just like Eugenia struggles with social media presence and real life. Social media is a toxic place and for someone fresh out of recovery needs to learn how to be them, not how to be who people want or expect.

Edit... just like everybody is saying Eugenia should stay away from social media.  Why does that mean Taylor relapsed/is relapsing?"

It started out great. He told me about his childhood abuse, and how his family was still abusive to him. About his past relationships and how horrible they had treated him. I told him that I wouldn't over and over, because at that time I wouldn't have. 

I started isolating myself from friends because his exes would do whatever and ended up cheating on him, so to prove I wouldn't do that... I started to isolate myself. It was my choice to show I love him. 

Then I was always texting or talking on the phone or with him I  person, because he needed me emotionally, I was the only one he had. I was the only one who loved him, and I was going to prove to him I would never leave him, because I loved him...

And then I was never allowed to do anything I wanted to do, what I wanted to watch, what I wanted to listen to, what I wanted to cook and eat, sleep when I wanted to for how long I wanted to, walk where I wanted to or how long or short i wanted to and heaven forbid if i did anything alone...

He groomed me to think this is what a relationship was suppose to be... that everything I did in those 5 years was my choice so I can prove my love....

And he still accused me of lying, cheating, not talking to him enough... eventhough he was literally the only person I talked to! 

He even would threat committing suicide when he felt like I was pulling away. 

I finally had enough one day. He accused me for the millionth time of cheating on him, because I was going to trade baseball card size art cards with other artists... it was a way to cheat in his eyes. After 5 years, losing all of my friends, and just about my family. An incident of him hitting me and my dog, countless trauma, no sleep, waking up terrified because I slept too long and was going to have hell when I called him, not being able to do anything because it was all about him.... he still could not trust that when I say I wasnt going to cheat... I just wanted to have a fun thing... I was still a whore. 

And even then... after a month he came back, promised it was going to be different... it wasnt. Because i did take him back. And when we were going to have a weekend alone... he freaked out and accused me of never loving him because i lose a literal speck of paper he gave me 6 months ago. 

It was never going to change or get better. 

I was being mentally and emotionally abused by this guy. Groomed, manipulated, used, and much more."
