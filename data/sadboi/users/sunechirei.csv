Generally, they don't like diagnosing before 18 because pediatric minds are still in flux, but that doesn't mean you don't have it. 

If your doctor diagnosed you, it probably means they're worried about you and want to get you help, and it sounds like you need it. My dad didn't believe it for a long time either, but he came around. Just make sure that if your doctor prescribes you medicine that you take it. You have no idea how much I wish I could have been diagnosed at 15. Life would have been so much better so much earlier. Hopefully your parents understand soon. Maybe suggest they have a sit down with your psychiatrist and let them ask all the questions they want."

It is not safer to lie about your health. At all. Your mom is wrong about that. Doctors need to know your full medical history because there are things you might not know about. Like, my mom was an Ashkenazi Jewish person (she died when I was born), and my step-mom hid this fact from my doctors for years. Turns out, I could be at risk for passing on genetic disorders to any future children. That is important information. Make sure you get as much information as you can about your birth-father because it's important for your health.

Bipolar has been shown to be hereditary. If you're not showing symptoms, I wouldn't worry about it, but sometimes you don't show symptoms until you're in your mid to late twenties, so it's something to look out for. I have bipolar and developed symptoms at 14. My maternal grandmother, cousin, and paternal uncle have/had it, so I was at high risk. It's possible that you'll never get it, but be on the lookout because it will change your life if you have it.

As for the race thing, yes, you are biracial, and as an adult it's up to you whether or not you want to identify as such on legal documents. Personally, I'd say go for it because it's your truth. It's who you are. If you're able to get away from your mom and step-dad, live life as you are, and that person is not white. You can get in contact with your birth-father's tribe, learn about your hereditary culture, and all of that. But if you don't feel safe, that's okay. Your safety is the most important thing here."

japanese,fkg0kfm,t1_fkg07d3,1584146981.0,"No. 

Plain and polite is more about how the verb conjugates.

Plain form: 行く, 行った, 行かない, 行かなかった　

Polite form: 行きます、行きました、行きません、行きませんでした

The verb stem, 行, most commonly a kanji, stays the same, but the ending changes. So other words will not be as important.

And Keigo is a whole other thing.

Really, this is all stuff that's explained in textbooks. I think you should start studying the grammar if you're interested in the language."
japanese,fkg02l8,t1_fkfztk4,1584146636.0,Oh. Yes. But don't worry about that too much right now. Start from the beginning and work your way up to Keigo. It's a complicated topic that even native Japanese speakers struggle with if they've never been in a business situation.
japanese,fkfz25y,t1_fkfy0ud,1584145938.0,"So, in Japanese there are two main levels of politeness: plain form, used with friends and close people, and polite form which is used with people you don't know or want to show some respect to. 

Take, ""I eat dinner"" as an example.

Plain form: 私は晩ご飯を食べる。
Polite form: 私は晩ご飯を食べます。

The verb, 食べる, changes form. I won't go into the rules because it's really something you should learn through a book, but they have a plain form and polite form for each tense and each verb. 

But that's not all. There's also Keigo (敬語), which is essentially polite language. I won't go too much into Keigo because it's a mess and I am not a master at it, but basically verbs conjugate differently, and sometimes are entirely different words, depending on if you are raising up the person you are speaking to, or if you are lowering yourself. The one I know best is to introduce yourself. For instance, ""I am Lin,"" in the different forms:

Plain form: リンだ。
Polite form: リンです。
Keigo: リンと申します。

I say don't worry about that too much at the beginning, but keep in mind that Japanese has varying levels of politeness. Most textbooks will start you out with polite form, then introduce plain form, then Keigo. 

As for words in Keigo, most commonly it's the verb that changes, but like わたし is polite, わたくし is more polite, and for men, 僕 is informal. All of them mean ""I."" There's also cases where you add お or ご to the beginning of nouns to make it more polite, depending on the origin of the word. 

I'm not sure what you mean by defined registers of speech. 

Pitch accent is different in Japanese than in Chinese. Chinese, tones are pretty much set (with the exception of double 3rd tones), but in Japanese they change depending on the particle, but also depending on the type of sentence you are saying. Interrogative sentences have a different tonal pattern than a command. A lot of times, it's important to know the difference in tones, like はし can mean bridge or chopsticks depending on the tonal pattern, but there is no real dictionary that can explain each word. That's another difference from Chinese."
japanese,fkfx62v,t3_fi9ewn,1584144657.0,"I learned Japanese after Chinese, and I can tell you they are VERY different beasts. You will have an advantage of knowing a lot of the kanji, but if you learned simplified characters you won't know as many as you think, as well as kanji is not always the same in Chinese as in Japanese. 

But the biggest difference is the grammar. They are very different. Chinese doesn't conjugate. Japanese conjugates verbs multiple different ways, more than English, and it also conjugates adjectives. Sentences also build very differently. Chinese builds in a similar way to English. 

I ate food, and 我吃饭了 have the same basic structure. But 私は食べ物を食べた has an entirely different structure, with the verb coming at the end. That's also only one way to say the sentence (plain form, rather than polite form). Another big thing is the levels of politeness. There is a little bit of that in Chinese with 您, but Japanese takes politeness to a whole new level, having different words, structures, and conjugation depending on the level of politeness. 

Another thing to watch out for is counters, or measure words in Chinese. In Chinese, they come before the noun being counted. In Japanese, they come after the particle of the noun being counted. 

I could go on. They are two very different languages. It's not like with Spanish and Italian. Yes, there are homonyms, but you'll find those are actually few, and I know I sometimes struggle to remember which is which (半 is a particularly hard one for me to remember which is which). 

That being said, you do have a leg up because you know how to study kanji. Just remember that kanji have multiple readings, which is not always the case in Chinese, and they are not always the same between the two languages. 

I wish you luck!"

TwoXChromosomes,fkaj8dz,t3_fhchwm,1584010272.0,"For a long time, no one really believed how bad my cramps were. My dad did (thank goodness) because my mom had the same type of cramps, but people at school and doctors thought I was exaggerating. So I pushed through and went to school, even when I felt like passing out or throwing up from the pain. 

Now, though, I have something I can compare it to. A few years ago, I had to have my appendix removed because it became inflamed, and the pain from that legit felt like my period cramps. My period had just ended when it happened, so I was confused as to why I had more cramps. I sat in the ER with my dad for five hours before they saw me, and as I was sitting in the hospital bed, in pain, I finally asked someone if I could have some pain meds. They were shocked because I wasn't writhing, I wasn't throwing up, I was just sitting there calmly reading. I had to explain that this was normal pain for me because of my cramps, and that's the first time I had someone actually believe my pain. 

Funny how it took needing an organ removed for people to understand. 

Okay, as for managing it, people have suggested taking pain meds, and I agree. A great thing to do is to pre-emptively take them. So like, two days before your period start taking some ibuprofen and continue throughout your period. Also, heating pads or hot water bottles help SO much and can ease the pain while also warming you up. Even though it hurts like hell, get up and go on a walk. You don't want to, but it can really help. 

Unfortunately, you're going to have to do some trial and error to find out what works for you, but once you do, it'll make things much better. 

I hope your cramps go away soon!"

TwoXChromosomes,fk8hrrk,t3_fgk9cc,1583956278.0,"I'm going to come at this from a different angle, one that many people don't think about or consider because it's not their life.

My mom died giving birth to me. No one knows why, no one knows what caused it. One minute she was fine, the next her heart stopped. I was maybe 3 minutes old. When she died, my dad lost his wife. My brother and sister lost their mother. My aunt and uncle lost their sister. My grandparents lost their daughter. A woman, a full grown, adult woman with family and friends and a college degree, memories and experiences, died because of childbirth. 

Getting pregnant and having a baby is not easy on your body, and yes, people do die from it. It's not as simple as, ""well just have the baby,"" because your life and your body will NEVER be the same after. If you keep the baby, you're responsible for another human life. If you give it up for adoption, you're left wondering what happened to that baby. Your hips are wider. Your boobs are saggy. Your brain changes. And you could DIE. 

Now, my mother wanted me. She wanted three children. I was number 3. She was excited to have me, had my name picked out, clothes, everything. I was wanted. But still, if I could go back and tell her to get an abortion, to save her life, I would. Because that day people lost their family. My brother and sister would go on to be abused by the woman my dad married when I was 3. If she hadn't died, their lives would be so much different, and without the trauma that they have. I wouldn't exist, but they would have their mother. No one would miss me. People miss her.

Now imagine if I wasn't wanted. If the government had forced my mother to carry me to term, and she died because of it. How would that be fair? Why do we value a potential life over a current one? Why say that a fetus, who has no memories, no connections, nothing, is more important than the mother? Forcing women to have babies is oppressive. If you can't take a dead body's organs without permission, even if it would save a life, why are we forcing women to possibly die to have a child they don't want?

If you don't want to have an abortion, that is your choice and I respect that. But what a woman does with her body is none of the government's business, and it's none of your business either."

The bipolar, on the other hand, was different. I would switch from being very quiet and very calm and collected to full on mania without warning. I'd have energy, I'd talk fast, I'd think fast, everyone thought I was on drugs, and I had trouble sleeping. But that energy would soon turn to irritability, and I'd end up a screaming crying mess for NO reason. I'd then spiral down and end up hurting myself in a state of depression. 

PTSD and bipolar are different. Bipolar requires manic episodes, whereas that's not really a thing with PTSD. Having a family history of bipolar doesn't mean you will have it. I have it, my cousin has it, and my uncle had it, but my sister, brother, and my other cousins (like 10 of them) do not. Likewise, trauma is hard to classify as ""bad"" or ""not bad."" Trauma is trauma, and everyone's brains will process that trauma differently.

When I'd miss out on school activities like field trips, or anything requiring a parent signature, I would always say it was my fault, and not the fault of my nstep-mom who refused to sign anything unless it would raise flags at school. 

That being said, I wasn't fully aware for a long time. When my friends would talk about getting grounded, I always thought they were spoiled because their grounding was only for a few days and didn't come with violence or restricted food access (some days in Elementary school, my only meal came from the cafeteria because we were required to eat and if we didn't the school would call home). I also couldn't believe that my friends got help from their parents on homework, nor that they didn't have to buy their own materials for things like the science fair with their own money from allowances or birthdays. It wasn't until I was in high school and removed from my nstep-mom that I realized just how messed up everything was in my house. 

Really, I had two moments:

The first was the last time I saw my nstep-mom when I was 14 and she told me right to my face that she'd never hit me or insulted me in the ways that she had literally just done, and I realized that she was nuts. So I left her house and called my dad who picked me up (it was a court mandated visit. I refused to go back for more.)

The next time was probably a few years later. I was 16 or 17 and knew that my childhood was messed up, but didn't realize just how bad until I talked about a traumatic moment with a close friend and she got really quiet for a moment, then said, ""the more I learn about your childhood, the more your anxiety makes sense."" I don't know what it was, but that moment, hearing her say that, really clicked with me and I realized that my friends from elementary/junior high school weren't spoiled; I was abused."
raisedbynarcissists,fiusttq,t3_f9s4ht,1582747622.0,"I've for sure been triggered by my own crying. Just the other week, after years of being okay, my friend said something that triggered me (not on purpose, she was trying to comfort me and just happened to stumble onto the wrong thing), and I broke down, and then I couldn't stop crying because I kept thinking about all the beatings I'd get as a kid for crying and I ended up having to take my emergency anxiety medicine to calm down enough to breathe. It happens. You're definitely not alone.

My advice is to get professional help. I did EMDR therapy for a while when I was a teenager, and it helped me process a lot of what I was going through at the time. I would also get officially diagnosed by a psychiatrist and maybe talk about medicine to help with the anxiety. I know medicine has a bad rep, but it changed my life completely and I'm much more stable now (doing an MA and about to start a second one, which wouldn't have been possible without help). Therapy and medicine can really help you get a handle on your emotions and get to the point where you can cry without spiraling. 

I really hope that things get better soon."
LearnJapanese,fiurgj9,t3_f9q1ug,1582746884.0,"I tried to use JFZ and it was far too slow for me, especially after doing an accelerated Mandarin course in China. My first year of Japanese, I used Genki, but found the rate of kanji to be too slow. When I started my MA in Japanese Language, my school used Minna no Nihongo and I actually really like it, more so than Genki or JFZ. It might be worth checking that out."
TwoXChromosomes,fiulr3x,t3_f9ubvx,1582743812.0,"As someone who grew up with a single father, the only thing I can say is make sure they know you're comfortable with it. Even if you're not. Sit with them, let them know that it'll happen some day and that they can come to you, or not. Do research. Talk to them about cramps, heavy flows, and what to expect, and what not to expect. Sometimes, periods can go wrong from the first one (my cousin didn't stop bleeding for a month until she was put on birth control her first period), so them knowing what to expect can help a lot. But also knowing that they CAN come talk to you is important. I know it's not always comfortable for either of you, but it is helpful when they need you. My dad was always weird about my period, and that made it hard to talk to him sometimes. 

Having a cabinet is always good though. That way, if they are embarrassed, they don't have to talk to you because it can be weird at first."
raisedbynarcissists,fiof3lu,t3_f8vaj4,1582582019.0,"The last time I spoke to my N-Step-mom, she'd just finished telling me how awful of a person I was, and that I was unlovable and no one would ever be able to care about me, and I called her out on it (I was 14 at the time). She looked me straight in the eye and said, ""I've never said anything like that to you.""

That's when I knew I couldn't be around her anymore. I walked out and haven't spoken to her in almost twelve years."
LearnJapanese,fin8by7,t3_f8o5yn,1582558112.0,"I'm past intermediate (in an intensive language program atm), and I really struggle with adverbs. I don't know why, but I really struggle to remember and use them, which sucks because they're very useful."
LearnJapanese,fi9y7dd,t3_f78rqw,1582287301.0,"Learning the kanji as early as possible, especially for common words such as 起きる, is incredibly helpful. You will rarely see words like that without the kanji, so knowing it from the get-go is helpful. Don't be put off by kanji that look complicated. I learned Mandarin before I started learning Japanese, and one of the biggest mistakes I made learning Mandarin was relying on pinyin (the romaji equivalent) instead of just learning the complicated characters. It took me a few months to get out of that habit, and once I had, learning went much faster and I gained a much deeper knowledge of the language itself. It's the same with kanji. Knowing the kanji brings a deeper understanding of Japanese, and the more you learn, the easier it will be to pick up new ones."
relationship_advice,fi9xafs,t3_f75uzw,1582286314.0,"Bipolar is an incredibly complicated disability, one that I suffer from. Having bouts of depression, which is what it sounds like you're describing, isn't necessarily bipolar disorder. She would also need to have moments of mania: extreme energy, impulsivity, etc. Others have asked if she has an official diagnosis, and I do think that's important to ascertain. It's also important to know if she's on medication. I cannot function without my medicine. If I don't take it, I either drop into depression so bad I can't get out of bed, or I'm so manic I can't control my actions and end up hurting myself. If she's not on medicine, or hasn't seen a doctor, she needs to.

As for being a better boyfriend...really the only thing you can do is understand. Make sure she knows you're supportive of her, but also know that if she's not willing to get help for this disorder that it's not the end of the world to leave. You are not responsible for her mental health, especially if she refuses to get help. I know that sounds harsh, but asking a significant other to be your therapist is unhealthy for both parties."
AmItheAsshole,fi7p3j5,t3_f6eejv,1582225542.0,"YTA 100%. I cringed reading your entire post. When I was your daughter's age, I had a belly too, and my step-mom made me feel so terribly about my weight that even now, at 25, I struggle with eating and food in general. And I am not overweight. You do not need to be telling a NINE YEAR OLD that she's fat and unhealthy. Period. You are damaging your child's psyche and instilling unhealthy relationships with food. Your wife, who is healthy, knows a hell of a lot more about what her daughter needs than you do. Limiting her food, forcing her to go to the gym, and not letting her be a child is harmful and could lead to her having an eating disorder at a young age. Shame on you for obsessing over the way your nine year old child's body looks."
AmItheAsshole,fft2bj5,t3_eurjt5,1580203274.0,"To begin with, I want to say, 100%, you are NTA. At all. You are in a terrible situation and you need to get out of it. I've read through so many comments and they've all given great advice about getting out, but I wanted to give my own perspective.

I am a woman, and my mom died giving birth to me. I understand (to a very very small extent) what he's going through right now. I am terrified of giving birth. I have all of my mom's health issues, and I have rules for myself about not getting pregnant after 35 (the age she died), and I plan on having a high risk pregnancy, and I plan on writing letters to my child if they ever come about, and I want pictures taken of us together when they're first born because I have no pictures of me and my mom (the story is my dad ripped the film out of the camera when it happened). I also plan on making sure whoever the dad is knows not to make the mistakes that my dad made, like cutting off my mom's family and giving away all of my mom's things. 

BUT, the difference between me and your husband is I plan on living. I plan on being there for my baby's first steps, for their first day of kindergarten, for their high school graduation, and for their first child. And I can be in that place because I got help. Your husband, and your FIL, need help, and you need to get away from them ASAP. They are living in fear, a fear they don't need to live in, and are ultimately planning for you to not live. They aren't taking precautions, they're planning for the worst to be 100% true, and that is scary. I know what it's like to be terrified of childbirth because my mom died, but there are healthy ways to deal with it, and unhealthy ways, and what is going on is incredibly unhealthy. 

Get out, now."
