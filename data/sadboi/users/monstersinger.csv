Anxiety,fosv5b1,t3_g8v0l8,1588038692.0,"I thought I was the only one that felt this way. Ultimately, it’s made me learn more about myself. I realized that maybe having a remote job is what would benefit me the most. I even started looking into it. I developed a great routine. I had always thought I wasn’t a morning person but I find myself waking up earlier than I usually did for work. The anxiety of all my responsibilities and the fear that I didn’t have enough time to complete them all would keep me up. Now it’s okay if I don’t finish everything and I actually get more done anyway because of my routine. I’ve been able to be more creative recently too because taking away my commute I have two more hours a day to myself. I’m a musician and I feel like the past few years I hadn’t had enough time to dedicate to my craft. I feel more confident and happy with my work. I don’t wanna go back!"
TVRepair,flqqppu,t3_fqkdnd,1585403719.0,"So one day as I was watching TV it turned off on me. I tried turning it back on with the remote and when that didn’t work I tried turning it back on with the side buttons. Now this whole time, the red light at the bottom of the tv was on (it indicates that it’s plugged in but turned off). I unplugged it for a while and plugged it back in. Still nothing. A few days later my brother was watching tv like nothing. I asked him if he had issues with it and he said no. Soon, it happened to him too. I timed it once. It was on for about 25 minutes and then gave out again. I suspect it could be because it was placed near a heater vent for a while and maybe something inside was a little too toasty and died off. I’m not sure. It’s placed in a different location now but still goes on strike and refuses to work."
