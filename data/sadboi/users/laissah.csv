Even though I was so young at the time, I still remember the fear and trauma I felt so vividly. Since then, I’ve been absolutely terrified of cars and driving. And I agree with you, the most terrifying part is that you can’t control other drivers. I miraculously got my license when I was 19 and I’m 24 now, but  I still have the anxiety. I only drive when it’s absolutely necessary and I try to carpool or get dropped off by someone whenever I can. I still can’t do highways though. Its just a fear I have yet to overcome.
