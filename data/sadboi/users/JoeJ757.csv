It’s really a 4yr/56mil deal.


Let’s take a look:

Zeke:
6yr/$90 million
Agent: Rocky Arceneaux

2020 cap hit: $10.9m
2020 dead money: $25.8m

2021 cap hit: $13.7m
2021 dead money: $14.9m

2022 cap hit: $16.5m
2022 dead money: $10.8m

2023 cap hit: $15m
2023 dead money: 6.7m

2024 cap hit: 12.6m
2024 dead money: 2.6m (not a big hit at all - they could opt to cut him after the 2023 season if he sucks, so this contract is really a 4 year contract if we’re being honest)

2025 cap hit: $15.4m
No dead money 

2026: $16.6m
No dead money

The Zoloft you’re taking (50mg) is the lowest dose (I believe) and .25mg of klonopin is definitely the lowest dosage so I don’t think you’ll have any issues taking that once a day. When I was on it I took 1mg twice a day, but I switched over to Xanax because I needed something that kicks in faster (I probably would stay away from Xanax if I were you). It makes me feel normal and I have zero side effects but my brother says the withdraws when you try to get off of it are terrible (I can see that, but I don’t know if I’ll ever get off of it tbh).

cowboys,fka6rxi,t1_fk98xg1,1583994639.0,"People don’t understand, they don’t realize that if Cooper leaves then Gallup becomes the #1 WR and we have to draft a guy & pray he’s really good in the pros (this position is NOT easy to predict). When Cooper is gone then defenses realize they can start cheating towards the line of scrimmage again and Zeke won’t gash the hell out of them & they damn sure don’t need to double or bracket Gallup. 

It’s bad enough that we’re going to lose our #1 corner and now freakin Awuzie is #1 on the depth chart and Lewis is #2. So if you let BOTH Cooper and Jones leave - your team now has Gallup as the #1 WR and Awuzie as the #1 corner. I don’t care how good these new coaches are, losing that kind of talent at those positions would drastically change this team for the worse.

In addition to that, the Cowboys have $80m in cap space and can create another $40m with 4 contract restructures and another $8m by cutting Crawford. It’s going to cost a lot of money, but Dak and Cooper have to get signed."
