Then find a rectangular shape in the room like a window, door, tiles on the floor, a magazine using only your eyes.  

Trace the width (shortest) whilst breathing in for 4 seconds, trace the length (longest) whilst exhaling for 7 seconds. Repeat that along the edges of the the rectangle, focus on the counting, breathing, and repeating.
