Amitriptyline and Lamotrigine are for depressive episodes and I take methylphenidate because of ADD. But it certainly helps with my constant fatigue and as an adjunct antidepressant.

Does this regimen make more sense to you now? 

My life definitely got better with the Amitriptyline, Lamotrigine and Aripiprazole. That's why I'd like to stay on them for now. I feel like the Aripiprazole is also necessary because I tend to act very irresponsibly when having an episode.

I don't know how long I'm going to stay on the meds. What I do is to force myself to care about the now, since I'm usually overthinking and planning decades ahead.

It's mainly anxiety and residue depression. The anxiety is especially bad. It makes dysfunctional in certain aspects of life. That is, dealing with people in authority and it's a great burden on me.

depressionregimens,fib8mkt,t3_f4dwg6,1582316837.0,"Yeah, don't quit Aripiprazole cold turkey. They should have known. Why were you even put on that? 

I took many meds and my favorite were Escitalopram, Venlafaxine and Amitriptyline. But still none of these may work for you. But they're among the most effective ones, generally speaking.
