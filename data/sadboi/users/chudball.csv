brainfog at 100, yeah I had some medications that I can not remember the name of right now and some that were in shots. They were pretty good but definitely more of only in emergency.

I'd say benefits of diagnosis are you are no longer in limbo, wondering whats wrong with your body, making up excuses for yourself and others.. now you have it on paper, from a specialist. Your life changes and you benefit from treatment, from learning how to take care of yourself..

Try creative outlets, things that are within your limits but allow you to express yourself. 

Its good that you know how to detect an oncoming flare but as you know stress is one of those 3 bad boys for us, you're doing yourself no good by revving your stress up, what will come will come.

Don't be so tough on yourself, work when you can but please let yourself rest too, you know how these bodies are :/"
lupus,fb7jpsk,t3_ebpled,1576592049.0,"Yeah! this has been driving me crazy for the same reason, knee pain and all. I even tried stretching I thought I could relieve it the way one cracks their back :/ Best I got was hot packs, oils and a massage!"
lupus,fb602pz,t3_ebgnyf,1576538064.0,"I understand, do know its okay to feel this way.. sometimes your weight is waaay up there but sometimes it will be waaaay down there. There's not much we can do besides care for our diet and have some compassion for ourselves. It's okay to feel down about it, just try not to fall to far in the hole. All we care about is that you're here and fighting a good fight."
ChronicPain,f9lmyyy,t1_f9km0ji,1575427001.0,"thats crazy, a family member had the same reaction. She was a completely different person on this medication and tried to commit suicide too. It's really turned me off about ever having it for my pain.."

lupus,f9h0ebd,t1_f9gvhjx,1575307375.0,"oh wow, the only thing that had occurred to me before was raising awareness locally via advocacy groups through social media but unforgettable ? thats good. I cant think of anything other than tshirts, decals or some sort of ice bucket-esque thing though..."
lupus,f95akvw,t3_e2b4ka,1575123381.0,"yeaa, the first thing i did when i got diagnosed was go to a therapist. I was already crazy miserable before sle was just the cherry on top and I knew i couldn't handle it. 
Or that anyone else would understand for that matter.. and it has helped very very slowly."
lupus,f959x8q,t3_e2lkwq,1575122898.0,"its easy to lose hope when your body betrays you.

how are you supposed to have some level of comfort when you can't even be comfortable in your own body...

anyways, some understanding from people around me. I know i look fine, but I am pain & tiredness incarnate. 
Patience, I'm young but i dont have the mobility an able bodied person does.
I think it really boils down to comprehension & inclusion.. 
what i want for me is a guide, have you done this and this to feel better ? rehab, supplements, etc."
lupus,f958kb3,t3_e2snei,1575121911.0,"I was 22 when I got chemo, cytoxan/cylophosphamide etc. I was already diagnosed but I had a serious nueropsychiatric flare that was affecting me. The chemo worked for a while and I felt heaps better. I did lose my hair, I had no appetite, very very nauseous but it was all back to scheduled lupus programming maybe 2 or 3 months later. so u win some u lose some"

are you looking into playing with contours ?"
lupus,f7cxgss,t3_dvep3z,1573602315.0,Have you done prednisolone and or cellcept ? getting a round of these via IV and maybe cytoxan depending on the flare helps me.

lupus,f5oqm2j,t3_dokoeg,1572327247.0,"I had some minor remissions during the journey but basically I've had one almost every year more often than not twice a year. The most serious organ involvement I've had is brain (fevers, hallucinations, inflammation, etc). Stress sets me off very easily and off I go.. 

I too am 23!"
blackmagicfuckery,f4vhydf,t3_dlytzh,1571842745.0,its all fun and games until the pressure cooker blows and then you're all screaming and ducking for cover...
