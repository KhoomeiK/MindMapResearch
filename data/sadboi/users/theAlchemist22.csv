Common knowledge is just a downstream result of repeated aggreeances. Right or wrong.

So what I was saying is that if you take Oxy, wait for full effects, then add Tia, then you'll likely see synergy. No telling how much tho. Depends on your tolerance and all that shit.

But to take a massive dose of Tia (north of 300mg), then dose Oxy would maybe result in some synergy but theres a much larger likelyhood that so many of your receptors would already be saturated/bond by Tia and the Oxy wouldnt bind to many receptors. Therefore, making little to no difference.
