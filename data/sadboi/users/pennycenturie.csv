I grew up mostly before phones but with the whole narrative that boomers promote that younger people are addicted to their phones, and also that being on a phone is a unilaterally bad thing, it's really funny to me, my boyfriend, and my friends, when we're at dinner with our families and everyone over the age of 50 is on their phone the *entire* time, and the younger people are just talking with each other. All the older people feel like they need to spread the news about their favorite apps through word of mouth, meanwhile the younger kids will genuinely engage with each other within the given opportunity for face time, and make a mental note to send links over text later on. And the whole time, the underlying conversation among the boomers is ""lol phone bad.""

It strikes me as unlikely that someone of boomer age would really be teaching 3rd grade in 2020, but in general anyone over 40 or so, right now, has some statistical likelihood of being generally anti-phone, and it's just, like, laughable."
The10thDentist,fr2ht7a,t1_fqw6yw3,1589837528.0,"Dude, if you don't want head, I get it. I personally cannot receive head because of trauma. And if the reason you cannot receive head is because you are overwhelmingly disgusted by the idea that your partner would swallow your cum, that's no less understandable than any other reason to not ever want to get head.

Maybe I spoke out of turn encouraging this person to take some time and consider their outlook on head, if they compare swallowing cum to eating shit. However, as a member of the vast minority who does *not* like getting head, I noticed here the fact that I have never before run into a situation where I *incorrectly* assumed someone wants head when they actually don't, and so I think it's safe to say that this person should, in fact, take a moment to think about how he sees his partners, if swallowing cum strikes him as being the same as eating shit. Because if he *doesn't* reconsider that outlook, he's gonna be an incel. You know, like the pice of garbage that you are.

You, though, you can go ahead and just eat shit. Just go on and do it. Eat shit."

antinatalism,fqymp13,t1_fqy3dyy,1589751091.0,"You're taking my (pro-sterilization) comment and inserting into a scope too broad to take any practical action towards. Yes, obviously, every human being *should* be sterilized, and we *should* all be provided with painless suicide tools through government programs. But when we, as a group, go around promoting only the *end goals* of our ideologies, we don't actually lay any groundwork to get any of it *done*. We have to speak on natalist or semi-natalist terms in order to grow our group to be a majority, and that's not going to happen when we're all just sitting around shouting about how great it would be if all of our dreams came true."
antinatalism,fqxwzyd,t3_glcxmy,1589739135.0,"So, this is a tough call for me because when I studied the third reich, I learned that its first move was to implement involuntary sterilization among the entire developmentally delayed *and* mentally ill population. I have schizophrenia, so that hit me really hard, in a way similar to when people make generalizations about what schizophrenia does to a person. I definitely don't think we should be reproducing, because this is a pervasive illness and it's highly hereditary. At the same time, though, I don't know how people who *don't* have delusions manage to find reasons to *not* kill themselves. And then, I cannot express enough how antinatalist I am, however, I always say ""I wouldn't vote for me"" because way too many of my policies would be indistinguishable from eugenics, and I know categorically that this is wrong, and also that pretty much anyone who has ""a solution"" to social and political problems cannot be trusted to singlehandedly make executive decisions, and everyone, but especially people with strong solution-oriented opinions need checks and balances for the larger ethical good.

But my cousin is developmentally delayed and married a woman with a similar condition, but she is very obviously (and definitely clinically) higher-functioning than he is. When they were making their wedding arrangements, a doctor sat them down to talk about birth control options, and this woman had the very admirable sense to have a hysterectomy (or tubes tied, if those are different, I don't know what the specific procedure was but it was sterilization). They ended up divorcing because my cousin's severe OCD drover her nuts.

I think that if this couple doesn't have people/family on duty helping them make decisions, that's a failure. With that support, they could have been helped through the decision to take permanent action towards birth control. However, when we look at someone with a developmental disability and say that sterilization should be obvious and nonnegotiable, we are edging towards the riskier attitudes in antinatalism.

The only way to fix this catch-22 that I see is to spread antinatalism to as many people as possible, so that the personal decision for permanent birth control is not a matter of government over-involvement in personal health. Because trust me, if I were president of the world, there would be NO MORE BABIES, EVER. But you have to face the fact -- I should never be president."

Keto_Diet,fqi6ap4,t1_fqi4boy,1589391056.0,"One strategy I've developed is using splenda as a topping to satisfy that sweet craving, with butter on a low-carb wrap, magic pop, or one of those mind-blowing new types of practically 0 carb sliced bread. I find that if I have something that could be off-program if I go overboard with it, I'm almost certainly going to go overboard. And it's worse with whipped cream/halo top/stevia milk chocolate than it is with high-fiber wraps and bread.

I have a lot of experience with keto, both with success and failure. I lost about 100 lbs in under a year on very strict keto, gained almost all of it back, and have been on more-or-less 30g net carb per day keto since august but I'm not losing weight because so much of my calories are coming from alcohol instead of food. I know what it's like to tell myself excuses about what's ""low carb *enough*"" and also what it's like to truly be within a productive keto mindset. I've seen myself lose the real spirit of it because I don't want to cook and just eat cold cuts on those low-carb wraps, and I've done keto so effectively that I'm barely hungry enough each day for one self-lovingly prepared omelette because I'm still satiated from the day before.

When I'm being most ""good"" on keto and I want something sweet, I definitely go for several ripe strawberries, sliced into chunks, with heavy cream poured over them and splenda mixed in. These ""good"" and ""bad"" associations will be different for everyone, but having been on keto before it was in the mainstream like it is now, I have a hard time with all these keto replacement foods, like low-carb cookies and breads, because I know they prompted my initial downfall. However, if they make any positive impact at all (which, for me, right now they do) then it's sure as fuck better than going back to a carb-heavy diet. Blech!"
Keto_Diet,fqi38pg,t3_gj1g9s,1589389175.0,"Take the total carbs and subtract the fiber for net carbs. A lot of people (and companies) believe that subtracting sugar alcohols is okay in addition to fiber, but I believe that's a recipe for disaster.

While it's not super keto to eat primarily keto replacement-foods that are all fiber, it is a great idea to welcome carbs that have enough of the grams attributable to fiber that you're getting only one or two g net with each serving, because people on keto often get more fiber than people who eat a mainstream diet, and it can be very good for your body. It will also most certainly make your poop weird, tho.

[edit] Looking again at your post regarding he sugar free candy, I will just suggest that there are some sweets which have fewer carbs than sugar free candy that advertises very low net carbs, since the sugar alcohols could easy knock you out of ketosis and could make your poop weird in a much more unpleasant way. I recently found a totally 0 carb whipped cream from the land o lakes brand, where it tastes less sweet than regular whipped cream (which is already fairly low carb) because they use just a small amount of regular splenda/stevia so that it's not overly sweet to people who are off sugar. There's also a new line of halo top ice cream that's designed to fit keto macros. I also eat milk chocolate sweetened with stevia, but I go overboard really easily. However it keeps me sane because I hate dark chocolate!"

The10thDentist,fqfabxi,t3_eh57rv,1589321386.0,"I hate gum and I love the chewy plastic covers on modern thermometers (like the ones in hospitals). I'm not an oral fixation type person but I do chew non-food stuff a lot, mostly my own skin. The thermometer cover is a little bit like skin, with how much give it has. However a normal disposable drinking straw is only gonna annoy me. I mean, obviously I'm gonna chew it. What, you think I'm gonna *not* chew it? I'm gonna. But I'm gonna be angry about it the whole time."
The10thDentist,fqf9v9a,t3_fitw0u,1589321157.0,"I don't entirely disagree on a fundamental level, except that any time spent fucking your corpse is time the doctors *don't* have to repurpose your organs.

[edit] I actually hadn't read your edit when I typed the comment. I'm gonna leave it tho, in case people might see that sentence with little/no context."

The10thDentist,fqf7wty,t1_fqf7cmn,1589320205.0,"I like creepy. I had a dream last night I had nine pet centipedes and I made a lot of effort to love them. Then they went and killed each other and I was like, ""oh yeah these guys are not puppies."" In any case I love goth creatures."
The10thDentist,fqf7byt,t1_fcecg46,1589319927.0,"Can I suggest that that person is a woman, but not ""female"" in the biological sense? Because semantically this can be resolved by differentiating between culturally relative terms like man, woman, girl, and boy, and the terms male and female, which are useful throughout not only the entire animal kingdom but also in plants. I'd like to also point out that there are many languages that have words in this category (of man, woman, girl, boy) that distinguish someone as intersex, which is a biologically real sex in our species, or ""third sex,"" which is more or less genderqueer."
The10thDentist,fqf70mq,t3_eh4w5l,1589319776.0,"I've been called a TERF for pointing out that a trans woman differs from a cis woman in that she has the experience of being trans when the cis woman does not. I'm not a fuckin TERF, feminism is for everyone, and I *know* about gender. But people are so prickly about even pointing out that we're actively using the terms ""trans"" and ""cis"" when this comes up. It's dumb."
LifeProTips,fqf62p4,t1_fqf4ojv,1589319324.0,"I'm on track to teach undergrad Writing for Engineers. If this is a skill you're working on now, I recommend /r/vxjunkies. It's a hobbyist sub for a fictional machine, and its use in this skillset is that all of the text is grammatically and structurally correct, but the actual words are fake. I think it's a neat way for some students in the sciences to get more confident with speaking and writing."
The10thDentist,fqf5law,t1_fk6iov9,1589319095.0,"I'm genuinely confused about how a person could not know what autism is. You should definitely google it. If you really need something to start with, the most primary trait is probably a total disconnection from the emotional realities of other people. Like, people who do *not* have autism are able to take a pretty good guess at how another person might be feeling, but a person with autism will have no clue. Often, instead of a focus on socialization, an autistic person will concern themselves with a technical skill or hobby, because they are gratified by learning the totality of information on a given subject."
The10thDentist,fqf53j0,t1_fk6b6df,1589318869.0,"My therapist told me my outlook on having schizophrenia is a commonly recognized outlook among people on the spectrum: If there was a button to make the condition go away entirely, I would only push it part-way."
The10thDentist,fqf4xxa,t3_fgl795,1589318796.0,"I like some tentacle porn but have a terrible fear of marine life, but I also just like being crushed by humans. Like, with a romantic partner, losing at wrestling that's playful but I still can't get out from under them at all no matter how hard I try. It's nice."
The10thDentist,fqf3mfs,t3_fg639v,1589318158.0,"Pica.

I ate a lot of paper when I was younger but I grew out of it. The adults around me were aware and said it was more or less okay as long as I was only eating stuff that wasn't dyed with potentially harmful stuff. Like, looseleaf and empty sugar packets, mostly. I had a lot of other problems at the time so it wasn't a huge concern.

[edit] someone below said pica means low iron and yeah, I literally got staph in my nose after using too much nasal decongestant spray because my iron was so low."
The10thDentist,fqf2oer,t3_fm7kjd,1589317708.0,"Yup. Also batteries taste great. It's some vitamin deficiency, not totally sure which one but I do know I have really bad anemia, so it could be that one. I don't suck on batteries anymore though, I learned how dangerous it was and quit. I miss the taste but I get so scared thinking how I could have exploded my face.

For anyone with a taste for metal do NOT go suck on delicious batteries after reading this. It is not worth it."

But FWIW I agree none of those animals are scary at all. I love rats, spiders, snakes, bees, all that. BUT. Fuck bugs, and FUCK MARINE LIFE. Whales are TERRIFYING and I HATE them. Squids? Fuck outta here with that shit. I would rather do ANYTHING than be anywhere near the ocean."

The10thDentist,fqexkku,t3_epko41,1589315256.0,"Aahhh! I've never met another one! But I *like* spicy foods, when they have a good flavor. Table pepper, however, just tastes like a dirty, dull knife."
LifeProTips,fqex5je,t1_fqew6bi,1589315057.0,"Yeah, it's not a perfect strategy. It can have its flaws. But one other thing I will add to all of this is that the gen ed classes that most likely are not your actual interest... that stuff can be stressful to study and get good grades on *at a good school*. At a 2-year school with no reputation, the expectations are so low that students with any work ethic whatsoever can set the curve. So yeah, building that GPA early on can be more realistic for some people if they go this route."
The10thDentist,fqewuja,t3_gbljju,1589314912.0,"Well the post is definitely appropriate on both subs, but your image of ""head in the clouds"" is kind of cartoonish and not a real trait."
The10thDentist,fqevlqb,t3_g6myf4,1589314330.0,"I like sleeping with all my clothes on too, but I think for a different reason. I have had a really, really hard time getting to sleep since I was really young. So when I wake up in the middle of the night and realize I managed to nod off without even changing my clothes or turning the lights off... that's such an incredible feeling."

The10thDentist,fqetxse,t1_fnyfipu,1589313538.0,"EDs are about way more than worth = body dimensions. While I've certainly spent thousands of hours desperately hoping that restriction will make me s k i n n i, the fact is that a strong desire to be thin does not alone an eating disorder make. The diagnosis of an ED is determined by behaviors regardless of underlying thoughts driving them. For years I've been ambivalent about my weight but I still don't know how to eat. I have deeply disordered eating and I actively do pretty much every major ED behavior. Even if I never think about body weight ever again in my life, I will never know how to eat. I, uh... really want a waste transplant. Something. Fucking anything."

Also, I recreate the ""fever dream"" state by wearing heavy sweats to bed, with heavy blankets, too. It will depend on the climate where you live and how much you control you have over radiators and ACs, but I find that I can *get* to sleep comfortably enough despite being super hot, but the hotter I am while I'm dead asleep the longer I stay asleep and he weirder my dreams are. I'm even much more likely to lucid dream when I do this, and that's the absolute best."
The10thDentist,fqes31d,t3_g3u6b3,1589312666.0,"I know the exact post that prompted this.

Just found this sub today and I'm obsessed. Nauseated, too, but whatever. And I noticed the post from one day prior to this one that is definitely the one that prompted this post. I don't know how excellent it really is that now I might end up seeing a video of someone eating a fucking mayonnaise, mustard, and nutella sandwich, but... good job, OP."
