depression,fqon9pd,t1_fql6gwe,1589519376.0,"Therapy is not a cure-all by any means but I implore you to consider trying again to see if you find a better fit. I see how overwhelmed you are, you're drowning right now and you need a helping hand. I just want to reiterate that this is not a personal failing, you have outside factors weighing heavily on you right now. It's not a personal weakness. Can you possibly give your psychiatrist a call to see if you can get a session sooner? Medication is perfect either but, respectfully, once a year is simply not support. Have your meds been changed at any point? 

&#x200B;

> Itâ€™s just all getting too much for me. I can only grit my teeth for so long. 

This hurts because I know the feeling of being at the end of your rope. I struggle with this most days, honestly. What I can say from personal experience is allow yourself that. You're human and you're ridiculously overwhelmed. Easier said than done but try to ease up on the judgement. Guilt and shame is definitely something I struggle with for a lot of what you've mentioned above and I'm not trying to negate any of your experience or your feelings but you've done nothing wrong."
depression,fqkfavp,t3_gjd3zh,1589426075.0,"Hey, OP. I resonated with a lot of what you wrote here and I just want to say, goddamn, you are being incredibly hard on yourself. You have had quite a bit going on. It's hard when you look back on your life and see the many mistakes you've made and how you should have done x, y, and z but what's usually missing from those self-deprecating thoughts is context. 

I want to say that mental illness doesn't discriminate. You could have the healthiest upbringing and be very wealthy and still deal with bipolar disorder, adhd, depression, and anxiety. Nature plays a big role in what we carry in life. Our genetics, our general temperament, what triggers us, a lot of that is a consequence of the genetic lottery. You didn't choose any of that. 

Listen, I know the feeling of being smart and feeling like you wasted all of your potential. But one, you still have plenty potential and two, you're dealing with a heck of a lot. You witnessed the decline and eventual death of a parent. That is incredibly traumatic and a big ordeal that effects your life and ability to do things. Major breakups and loss of love can really destroy people, it's one of the leading triggers for depression. Bipolar Disorder (which I have) can be one of the worst, most debilitating illnesses anyone can deal with. You're dealing with all of that, chronic pain and fatigue, and a whole host of things that I haven't mentioned. None of what you have to deal with is easy. None of it is something you willed. 

You're saying you should have pushed and applied yourself more. It's like asking yourself to continue hiking up a mountain carrying a heavy backpack that just gets heavier as you go, eventually collapsing under the weight, and being like I should have been able to make it to the top. In your current situation, you have financial support but a virtually nonexistent support system outside of that. People need support and others to continue carrying on.

Honestly, OP, there are plenty of points in your post where you address direct reasons for not functioning the way you'd like and yet you view the consequences of all of your mental and physical illnesses as a personal failing. It's not. You're understandably overwhelmed and exhausted. Anyone would be. 

Are you currently receiving any treatment or therapy for any of this?"

It is hard. It's hard as hell. I haven't seen a good future for myself for a long time. Is depression lying to me? All the evidence seems to suggest otherwise. So, is the best thing to do is to just die? I really can't come up with another solution.

You're so right. That pressure is a lot to deal with, especially alone. I know for a fact that if those people stuck around in some capacity, I'd at least have more hair on my head lol. But I'm supposed to be able to take care of myself and bounce back. I'm 26 so no excuses. That's certainly what my mind tells me anyway."
bipolar,fot7bu1,t1_fot3qbk,1588046297.0,"That's a good strategy lol. I'm really glad it worked. I don't know if there's anything left for me to lie positively about though. 

The thing is, I was so fucked up over losing my ex, friends, ruining my finances, throwing out all my things that I didn't really have a reprieve. When I did push to go to the store or the gym, I'd just cry all the time and I just wanted to die. The reminders of my former life were everywhere and I really couldn't distract myself from it. When I moved back home, my family was just like move on. You deserve better, you were ill but I could never believe it. By the time I did start enjoying things at home, my health took a nose dive and that pretty much sealed the deal. Now I hate myself for ruining my health and falling into depression while my ex and everyone else are living their best or at least normal lives. Still worried about people who probably forgot I exist. I'm trying to do self care now but the shit is so bad already. Like damn, I can barely shower, how I have to try to recover from all this other shit, too, you know?
""If I just pushed harder to eat and be active, if I stayed at that temp job, if I did anything but what I did, none of this would happen."" more guilt, more shame, deeper hole.

I almost got arrested and I didn't even care at the time. Actually, I almost got arrested a couple of times. Good lord. 

Frozen dinners saved me, too! When I could go outside at least. Then I started having vision and hearing issues that I was absolutely convinced that I caused by insomnia and not eating. I also have really bad health-anxiety as well so I'm still convinced I'm going to go completely deaf and blind. Anyway this made me more depressed so I didn't go outside at all and thus began the really destructive phase of starving which has caused hair loss among other issues and I'm convinced that I'm probably going to die so why not just take matters into my own hands? I can't seem to get out of the guilt/shame/self-loathing spiral that started once I came down from the mania. I lost a lot as a result of my manic episode so this whole health thing is just further proof for me that I didn't the deserve the people who were in my life and I'll never find happiness again.

Don't eat. And the sad part is I loved my size and curves, I loved food. Watching myself waste away actually makes me spiral further but  I get that ""you don't deserve to eat because you're worthless"" and or like you've mentioned, ""why bother eating? It'll be a waste since you won't be here."" Even when I get hungry or finally get the energy to get out of bed, I can't do it. I have some health issues from the extent of it, (most of) which are reversible, but depression has convinced me otherwise. 
This particular issue is actually what is pushing me most towards an attempt because the constant thought is ""look what you've done to yourself. You can't manage the basic act of keeping yourself alive with food. You've nearly starved to death and ruined your health. Who does that? No one else has done that because of depression. You're just broken."" And of course any appetite I may have had is lost after those thoughts. But it's not just me. I'm not the only one in the world who has gotten like this. Wow.

They are two of the most interesting characters in the series and their dynamic is always so fascinating. Others have already stated that they can work as foils for one another and gone more in depth than I ever can with my current brain fog but they see right through one another, too, in a way I have yet to see anyone else manage. Their respective weaknesses are obvious to one another, I'm sure in part because they're both intelligent and manipulative (as well as other similar traits already mentioned in other comments). I love seeing their minds work against one another but I particularly like how frazzled they get around each other. Both Khun and Rachel like to play calm and collected and that goes completely out the window when they have to interact. We get to see Khun be a bit more bratty and aggressive and annoyed and it's honestly great. Also Rachel lording info about Bam over Khun is so good. It's just fun. 
Man, now I want to re-read and come back with comments on each of their interactions lol. 

Also, I've been going through some serious Rachel withdrawal being caught up. Where is she?

I was in Lexapro for a few months and had the same experience. I didn't agree with the diagnosis and didn't have insurance at the time so after coming out of the hospital, it wasn't pretty. 
In any case, I had my doubts for a long time. I hadn't had any psychosis before, no mania that I knew of. All that you've previously mentioned. But I was 25 and under lots of stress for months, concerns about my ex-fiancÃ©, and then the Lexapro the worked so well, I couldn't believe I felt that good. Perfect cocktail to trigger the onset of mania. 
It's true thst SSRIs can induce all kinds of  different issues but it is also well-documented that SSRIs trigger the onset of mania or overt symptoms of bipolar disorder. And bipolar can be comorbid with other disorders so you could be on the Autism spectrum and be bipolar as well. 
It's certainly normal to doubt the diagnosis and be skeptical. And who knows, it could be that something else is going on and maybe you were misdiagnosed. Only you know yourself well enough but from this post alone, it does really seem like bipolar disorder."

Of course there are people who complete suicide for that very reason but that's usually unaddressed. But whether or not that approach is ""right"" or ""fair"" is really a question for another sub. 

The most important question right now is what's making you suicidal? What makes you feel like there's no way out? Talk to us."
SuicideWatch,fo1ctr1,t1_fo1brcn,1587430513.0,No problem! Glad I could help a little :) And post whenever you need to. Seriously. Don't keep it bottled up. We're here for you!
SuicideWatch,fo1aud1,t1_fo17l7i,1587429312.0,"Aww, I know that feeling for sure... I know how difficult it can be. But know that I do see you and you have so much worth. You know what I see from your original post? Someone who is caring and has lots of love to give but also someone who has worked hard as hell to get where they are. Those are things you should be so proud of! Sometimes when depression hits like this, it's hell. But it can also be a subtle way for your body to let you know that you're burnt out. I know it's lonely but despite all this, despite the hopelessness you have been holding on! Every day you succeed is a win. Every day you fail is a win because you're still here. I truly believe that.

I don't want to be super presumptuous but it seems like you're being really hard on yourself. You've been through so much all at once. It's okay to only shower one day or clean the other. You're running a bit low on energy and that's okay! Don't worry so much about ""getting yourself out of this."" Instead try to think what can I do today to make myself feel a little better? Everything you do is towards that. You deserve to be here and you deserve care and love. I know it sounds like bs but right now, a little tlc will help. And I'm always available to chat if you ever need to :)"
SuicideWatch,fo14dzj,t3_g52ivb,1587425510.0,Congratulations. I wish you well and hope you continue to enjoy your recovery.
SuicideWatch,fo12vzs,t3_g53cdc,1587424656.0,"Hey there, OP. I understand the struggle. Ive gone through a lot of the same losses myself. It's really tough. I know you're feeling lost and depressed, I get it but this is not the only way out. The thing that will help the most right now is doing a little of those things that are the hardest. Get a bite to eat, hop in the shower if you can manage, and drink lots of water. Also, do something, anything. Those things are more important now than ever in your situation. This will help you feel better and put you in a better position to get back on your feet. You are the point of living right now. I know it sounds like bs but it's true. Take small steps to take care of your physical well being. Please don't allow yourself to stay stuck. Speaking from personal experience, it's a hard habit to break.
Feel free to continue venting as well. Loneliness is one of the worst things anyone could experience but really, we're here for you. Hold on a little longer."

bipolar,fo0yvk5,t1_fo0y81m,1587422399.0,"Ah, right. Thank you."
SuicideWatch,fo0qvms,t3_g51eso,1587418090.0,It will very likely make you very sick and cause organ failure. It's dangerous for that reason and organ failure is very painful. Please. Just take a moment. What is going on to make you feel this way?
bipolar,fo0pibn,t1_fo02gxy,1587417369.0,"Yeah, thank you. I was struggling on the meds because I lost everything during my manic episode. I was horrible. And then I felt so much guilt and shame and got depressed and just stopped interacting with the world which made things 100 times worse for me. I know everyone struggles but I failed by not trying at all. I just feel like a broken alien or something, can't even relate to people here."
depression,fo0ovpc,t3_g502yi,1587417037.0,There is nothing wrong with being unable harm yourself. We all have a biological survival instinct that helps us survive. That makes you human. What's going on that made you feel this was your only option?
SuicideWatch,fo0oasm,t3_g50n3s,1587416728.0,It's very unlikely to kill you but is likely to give you liver damage or failure and other health issues. Please don't do this. Would you like to talk about what's going on? We're here for you.
Psychic,fo0msju,t3_g4f3dm,1587415937.0,People's lack of empathy always surprises me every single time. It's disturbing. I hope you and your friend are doing all right. Lots of love and light to both of you ðŸ’œ
Mediums,fo03y8t,t1_fo0382f,1587405661.0,Thank you. I just can't do this on my own right now...
Mediums,fo02qr1,t1_fnwwg7v,1587405056.0,I've been trying. It doesn't seem like I'm being heard.
bipolar,fnzrai2,t1_fnzpgvv,1587399361.0,"Currently no but I was for months, no improvement. Mostly my fault for giving up on life though."
SuicideWatch,fny6guh,t3_g4jkqx,1587354583.0,So happy for you. Best of luck with your recovery!
depression,fntdvvz,t3_g3n542,1587239691.0,I'm so sorry. I'm losing all of my hair everywhere too. It's not easy at all so I understand. You're not alone in your suffering. You're more than your alopecia but I'm sorry. I wish I could take away your pain.
SuicideWatch,fnrglxs,t1_fnrf0wv,1587188345.0,"It's okay. Had a mental breakdown and lost it. Manic episode and all that. No one wanted to deal with my insanity so they left. Was in a bad place right before then and of course got worse afterward. I apologized but they all wanted nothing to do with me. I actually fell ill following the resulting depression. Stress, not sleeping, and esp not eating like at all really messed me up. Not having work, money, love, anyone to talk to, losing everything at once, and feeling like it was my fault, I just broke down. Now I just feel terrible because I feel like my health problems were avoidable.

I'm sorry that you've gone through that though. I'm so glad you're doing better. Health issues are awful and even worse when you don't have support. Same for your cousin. I know not everyone can stay but everyone needs support. I have osteoporosis now, hearing loss, vision issues, hair loss just to name a few. Should have taken better care of myself. Now I have another mountain to climb and I'd rather just quit."
SuicideWatch,fnre2p8,t1_fnr7gjt,1587186212.0,"Thank you for your kind and honest comment. Damn, I'm so sorry about your therapist. I'm glad he's been able to help you though. That's amazing. I really am happy when people improve and become stable. I want everyone to be happy... Unfortunately, I've become so bitter about people having support, esp during their worst times because having loved ones around 6 months ago would have made a world of a difference.

I'm sorry. It's not the best feeling. Growing up, I had that resentment too. Now I mostly just resent myself for not being more stable. 

Oh no, quarantine or not, I don't have anyone these days. Used to a year ago. Anyway, it's okay. I just wish I was more functional and not broken."
SuicideWatch,fnr50j0,t3_g3fhfc,1587179445.0,Don't do it. It's likely to fail but it will put you in a lot of agony and potentially cause organ failure. What's going on? We're here to listen.
Mediums,fnq3ef6,t1_fnnd7z3,1587156923.0,Thank you so so much for sharing something incredibly personal. I will look at the site for sure. I just don't know how much longer I can hold on. I just keep wondering if I'll be forgiven for losing this fight.
bipolar,fnq2zau,t1_fnpyas6,1587156699.0,"It is incredibly tough. That's the hard part about depression, it convinces you that there is no hope and that you're beyond help. I'm glad you're fairly certain you won't harm yourself.

No, lots my friends after a manic episode. I have family left but they don't really understand. Haven't been in therapy for a couple of months because it wasn't really helping. I'm beyond help at this point. The only reason I'm alive is I don't have the tools to make a reliable exit but I'm hopeless. Not sure that I'll be here in a couple of weeks."
bipolar,fnpqzt4,t1_fnpfz9c,1587150398.0,Me too. I'm sorry you've been struggling so much. Do you have anyone to talk to about it or a way to get help?
bipolar,fnpqu6z,t3_g340vp,1587150316.0,"Been at a 1 for months, been 0 for weeks. I'm just tired. Happy that most are doing either well or okay."
Mediums,fnmsjdm,t1_fnlhwgl,1587077332.0,Thank you so much for this. I will keep this in mind.
Mediums,fnmsdgg,t1_fnlkn19,1587077243.0,"Thank you for your kind words and sharing your story. I'm so glad things are much better for you these days. I also felt lonely when I had an SO and friends but this has been nearly unbearable in a way I can't put into words. Alien is a good word, that's how I feel. Lonely and alien and broken. I will give your suggestions a try for sure though. Thank you."
SuicideWatch,fnmrs97,t1_fnkq33u,1587076921.0,"Thank you for your thoughtful response. I've been trying to let go of my past but the present is just so awful and I'm barely functioning. Things have only been getting worse for me because I lose more hope every day. If I really chose this life for myself, I should have at least given myself a sturdier mind. Thank you again."
Mediums,fnmqnr8,t1_fnluy40,1587076317.0,Thank you for your kindness and understanding. It's been difficult because I don't find joy in things anymore and things are different now with my health issues. I have been having trouble adjusting but I will give these a shot again. Thank you.
Mediums,fnmqcil,t1_fnm2ez9,1587076150.0,Thank you for the suggestions. I will give this a try. Thank you.
Mediums,fnmq7qy,t1_fnkaib7,1587076080.0,Thank you! I will give this a try.
Mediums,fnmq43y,t1_fnkv1ho,1587076026.0,"Thank you for thoughtful words. That connectedness is truly a beautiful thought. I have used the hotlines and I will continue to reach out. If I can hold on a bit longer, I will persue professional help again after the lock down. Thank you again."
