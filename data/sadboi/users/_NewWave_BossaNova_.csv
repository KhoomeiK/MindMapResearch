SuicideWatch,fqqchsf,t1_fqqbb5c,1589563146.0,I don't know. It just feels like I'm being rightfully punished and I'm never coming out of this. I want to have self worth and I want to love myself and I want to be loved but it feels like I'll never accomplish that and even if I could I won't deserve it. My existence brings no benefits and I'm a burden to everyone I ever loved or will love. It feels like everyone leaves me and I'm so alone and feel like no one could ever accept me as I am. I haven't given up on trying to improve my life but a big part of me wonders if it'll be for nothing. What if it never gets better? The intrusive thoughts and urges are winning lately and thats scary
SuicideWatch,fqplvry,t1_fqpl718,1589549392.0,Thank you for understanding and caring ‚ù§Ô∏è big internet hug back. I hope one day we can overcome this
SuicideWatch,fqp8ve7,t3_gjujjd,1589539169.0,Yes. I just want it to end but I'm too scared to do it myself. I wish someone would kill me so I don't have to exist anymore. I lived a good short life. It's selfish and cruel to want me to exist when all I feel is constant pain and misery. Just let me go fuck sakes.
SuicideWatch,fqo4jc7,t3_gjsxjk,1589507410.0,"This echoes exactly how I feel except I do self harm and for months none of my family has noticed. I've been bare armed around my family plenty and just angle it away. I always have one sleeve rolled up and one rolled down which I've never done. They've noticed I buy medical supplies that they never see in the medicine cabinet but don't ask. 


I don't do it for anyone to notice but knowing how obvious it should be to someone who fucking cares just confirms for me that nobody fucking does. I'm screaming I need help and I'm a danger to myself and nobody notices. But if I came out and said it id be ridiculed so fucking badly. I really wanna fucking die.
