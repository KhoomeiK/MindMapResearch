SuicideWatch,fjfw9lp,t3_fd39qh,1583302157.0,That resonates with me deeply. I don’t know what the fuck I’m even doing here. I wish my mother had aborted me lmao
lonely,fjenb7u,t3_fczgg3,1583274861.0,"Congratulations, you earned it and you should be proud :)"
SuicideWatch,fjefdng,t1_fjeexuk,1583270894.0,"That was very uplifting, thank you very much :) I’m waiting until the weather improves before going outside too much, nothing but rain here in Seattle lol"
SuicideWatch,fjef072,t3_fcvoh7,1583270686.0,"I’m also 21, a college dropout, a barista, and very suicidal. I don’t know what the fuck I’m even doing here. I want to pursue music but there isn’t much room for success with the music I want to play. Just wanted to let you know that you aren’t alone."
SuicideWatch,fjee67s,t1_fjddp9q,1583270232.0,"For fucking real. Someone people aren’t even phased or outraged by it, they just accept it and say “it’s just the way it is” like how can somebody be a sitting duck and be ok with the exploitation of others? Mind boggling. Absolutely mind boggling"
SuicideWatch,fjebssd,t3_fcwlga,1583268922.0,"I’m sorry. It’s not much better down here in the US. It’s average for people to be *thousands* in debt just to pursue and education. For reference, our national student debt amount has risen to nearly 2 trillion dollars. It’s awful. People either have to work dead-end, low-paying jobs for the rest of their lives or have debt on their backs for years to come. I’m angry and disgusted by it."
SuicideWatch,fjeb7p6,t3_fd0dh7,1583268595.0,I’m very happy for you. It’s refreshing to see somebody feeling much better!
SuicideWatch,fj8k37g,t1_fj8h9jj,1583115236.0,"For sure, dude. “Best country in the world” my ass. We can do so much better yet everybody’s been so fucking brainwashed into thinking that this is as good as it gets. Every idea that other countries around the world have already implemented is considered too “radical.” God fucking forbid we increase people’s quality of life and not allow such horrendous wealth inequality. We shouldn’t even feel the need to take such drastic measures just for an escape (and end up with a horrible addiction and even more problems on your plate). I truly do want a better world for everyone and I want to thrive and make changes. That’s also the only thing keeping me going. I hope people like you are able to stay here and make changes in the world as well. And I totally felt the same thing, solidarity and comfort when I read your post. Finally, somebody put into words what I’ve been wanting to express to the full extent for years. Even just knowing somebody else gets it and is willing to say something about it really helps."
SuicideWatch,fj8bqbl,t3_fbxqj8,1583109670.0,"Amen my friend. All of this suffering is so fucking unnecessary and could be avoided if we didn’t happen to have the most rich and powerful members of our society hoarding all of the wealth for themselves and having all of our government spending go towards whatever is the most profitable for them. I don’t want to be alive in a society where its members aren’t cared for and that are left to deteriorate on the street if they aren’t able to carry their own weight. I’m from Seattle and I watch it every single day. People constantly begging for change and wasting away on heroin. It both depresses and disgusts me (not disgusted with the ones suffering from addiction, but with the ones who allow people to live this way). In a country with this much wealth, absolutely nobody should have to live like that. 

Didn’t mean to get all preachy but I truly am disgusted and emotionally exhausted just from being a member of society. I don’t want any part of this rat race. America has zero room to be putting down “third-world countries” when they allow people to live a life of desperation and despair. Fuck this place, man."
SuicideWatch,fj89ybb,t1_fj71rtj,1583108473.0,"Wow, that’s fucking shitty. I’m very sorry."
SuicideWatch,fj88oxk,t3_fc0vk9,1583107635.0,I’m glad this resonates with someone. I don’t want to waste my life making some rich asshole even richer. I want to live my life for me and I don’t want anybody telling me what to do and I don’t want to ever be trapped. I want to claw my way out but I don’t know how and I’m oftentimes too depressed to even try. How is a life where you’re barely keeping your head above the water while slaving away worthwhile? I’d rather be in a fucking coffin.
SuicideWatch,fj87nwi,t3_fbvpd4,1583106966.0,A couple of times. I almost did go through with it once. The fear of failing and ending up permanently damaged got the best of me that time.
SuicideWatch,fj86pyj,t3_eyjkyc,1583106366.0,"In a similar boat, friend. I’m a 21-year-old gal, a college dropout and a depressed, suicidal mess. I have an amazing fiancé but I often wonder if he’s tired of dealing with my problems (I’m bipolar) and if I wear him down. He has his own problems and I hate bombarding him and introducing my own problems into the mix. I haven’t had any hobbies or done anything I really enjoy in years and I don’t even have the drive or motivation to do any of it because I’m too fucking miserable and out of energy. I can barely remember to feed myself. I’m only happy when I’m stoned. I wake up every day just wishing I had the guts to pull the trigger without hurting my family or my fiancé and his family. I wish I was able to give you reassurance or any helpful or uplifting commentary. All I can say is, you are so far from alone."
