SuggestMeAPodcast,fa078nd,t1_f7hos0u,1575749953.0,Agree with this. The music and narration are perfect. And the stories creepy and unsettling but not outright terrifying.
SuggestMeAPodcast,fa06odh,t3_e44pvb,1575749653.0,"Lore, or Let’s Not Meet. There’s something about soothing voices, music and creepy stories that really helps me fall asleep."

mentalhealth,f9f0odu,t3_e4lxhv,1575256494.0,"This is me currently. Tomorrow I start medical leave for a month, to recover from burnout and my mental health being in a bad state. I have plans for the gym, meditation, nature walks, some workbooks, and other things. 

I didn’t realize how bad it had been; I had every one of those signs. I think we need to continue to encourage breaks and time for rest and recovery. If I had allowed myself that earlier, I don’t think I would be nearly as bad as I am.

Thanks for sharing OP. We need to take burnout seriously."
