A party is just for social purposes and therfore is not essential at all. (Note that I mean the party isn't essential, it's just not essential at this time). Also, if you are a young and healthy person your chances of going to the ICU are really low and almost non existent, but you're not staying home for yourself, you're staying home for the people who can't fight off this virus by themselves (I.E. older people, obese people, people with heart desease)."
