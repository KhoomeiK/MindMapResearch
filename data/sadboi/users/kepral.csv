polyamory requires consent and open communication. poly does not mean you cannot cheat, i was in a poly relationship recently but I was still cheated on in that relationship as when you have not consented to your partner's other relationships, or are kept in the dark, it is cheating. (and imo it is worse when you're cheated on in poly bc you had all these open options and accepted availability but your partner still chose the one you had said no to,...) 

couples counseling does seem like the only option due to marriage and kids involved, but as i said, do bare in mind, even if you become okay with him seeing him, the other wife has not consented and that would still make it cheating, even if its not on you. 

if you had not been married with kids, bare in mind, my advice would be to dump."

Then there's how rape crisis centres don't accommodate male survivors. (This is including trans men actually), and are ""for women only"" (as the rape crisis telephone provider said to me, she wasn't aggressive, it's just that those are the rules). So there are fewer places to go, so even if men could tell they were raped, many won't find a rape crisis centre and will slip through the cracks and make a difficult statistic to track.

TumblrInAction,f77lcv8,t1_f5gwa8s,1573462615.0,"the other reply is wrong, tucute is a movement made against truscum because of them constantly fighting.

Truscum = believe you need dysphoria to be trans (and thus are called scum and hated, some can be very rude but idc? some are in the ""nb isnt real"" camp).

most truscum dont like fake pronouns like ""bunself"", or genders like ""cloudgender"" you know, the CLEARLY ridiculous ones, like I said, some truscum dont believe in NB, others see NB as only valid when it's genderless, not fluid.

&#x200B;

Tucute are the ones who use pronouns like ""bunself"" and they wear those pronouns (and ""Tucute"") as a badge of honour because it sometimes pisses off the ""oh so transphobic truscum"" and believe you dont need dysphoria.

&#x200B;

the other comment was actually talking vaguely and identifying people who dont ID as tucute. So I thought I'd give a mini history lesson from a 2009s tumblr Truscum.

&#x200B;

NB lesbians, is an evolution of tucute. you can tell from the name its based on truscum, and like truscum originally an insult one side gave to the other. for whatever reason women (cis and trans (and NB)) tend to be tucute, where as truscum are normally transmen. (theres something to unpack here, but the long and short of it is more commonly, transmen have more physical dysphoria because female sex has more secondadry sex characteristics and this causes a lot of angst and anger towards people who say theyre trans without dysphoria)Like Blaire White and Calvin Garrah (?) are ""truscum"".

&#x200B;

I used to follow a BIG name tucute on tumblr (reason why I left it back in the day, it was a hate following cus i thought they were trolling but oh boy).

this was mtf trans woman, like they fully identified as female, which is fine for me, but they chose to use pronouns like ""bunself"" because it made them ""cute"" and ""pissed off truscum"" and told people to become tucute because ""its fun and it pisses off the truscum"".

&#x200B;

So yeah, tucute are USUALLY actually trans, but they believe dysphoria is a bad diagnostic (stemed from wanting to focus on gender euphoria to not being focused on gender at all lol).

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

**Tucute are the otherkin tumblrism of made-up pronouns and non-binary made up genders, similar to trans trenders. Think ""astrogender"" and ""faeself"" (those are the pronouns, I know).**

so.. no, they're not ""wear a dress and get their balls waxed"" that woman is clearly just a predatory creep. But they are the ""you dont need dysphoria to be trans uwu being trans is about being cute"" type.

I know people who do that, ""thweyre bad, describe them as a narcissist"" which.. well there's valid reasons but to diagnose your abusers as NPD isnt the answer, and general narcissm as an insult isnt NPD, just like when someone says ""x is a borderline"", thats not about BPD.
