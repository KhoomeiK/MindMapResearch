All of it. I can promise you someone will listen and understand your pain.  This may help with access to support  for you and an understanding of what you’re experiencing.

Remember even if you brushed your teeth and showered today and didn’t tomorrow. Try and not beat yourself over it or feel guilty about it. I can see you’re trying and that’s all you can do.
Keep trying. You’re doing great. :)"
