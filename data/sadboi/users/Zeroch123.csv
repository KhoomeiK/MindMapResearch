Or maybe because Islam isn’t a religion of peace, as is infact a medieval and vile religion that needs to be reformed."
DemocraticSocialism,fr0dwvo,t1_fqxlj40,1589792167.0,"Imagine actually being this fucking brain dead. Imagine actually thinking it’s the responsibility of the tax payer to pay for you or your healthcare LMAO. This is the most entitled world view on the planet, you are objectively wrong."
DemocraticSocialism,fr0dse0,t3_glhqox,1589792039.0,"It’s almost like the fascist policies of the government forcing a lockdown caused the loss of jobs.... oh but you savants (/s) want to give more power to the government? Interesting. It’s almost like socialists deny science and individual liberty to achieve their goals.... oh wait..... you do. And no, bezos will never become a millionaire you brain dead children, I know socialists can’t do basic math and don’t know basic political theory or history but, wow this is bad."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fr0dl5z,t1_fr07bvl,1589791834.0,You obviously don’t understand the definition of humble or what context is
WhitePeopleTwitter,fr0dj8o,t1_fqzsa9r,1589791780.0,"Except his speech was literally not based on facts, like the last 40 years of democratic policy strategy. It’s almost like you act out of tribalistic fear because you don’t fathom a single industry or how they work. You just think everything is unsustainable except for your $30trillion objectively garbage mEdIcArE for all. Or the fact that the green new deal would cost more to implement in a 10 year period, than the economic damage of climate change over a 250 year period based off all current economic models. You are genuinely the party of science denial and fascism"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fr0dc7l,t3_glt3lh,1589791590.0,"Too bad those are the only good relevant facts about him because like most democratic presidents, genuinely awful at the position and has absolutely no understanding. Too bad the main thing to vote for in the Democratic Party is incompetence and corruption. Good thing president trump has made America great again tbh kag 2020"
mountandblade,fr015z3,t3_glphmw,1589780740.0,"I disagree somewhat. I feel like you should have war goals, now I know this is a massively re-iterated opinion. But you could have de-jure wars over specific castles/towns. Once you take the settlement it adds a culture/religion bonus conversion bonus after (X) amount of days of revolt/low production/plague/squalor. Any settlement you take OUTSIDE this war goal has a NEGATIVE culture/religion bonus. They honestly could just copy and paste the system from Viking Conquest and I’d be happy. But they should really just add the Viking conquest system and then expand on it. Just add a casus belli system so there isn’t CONSTANT fucking war. The fact that low manpower factions don’t ever take time to just chill out and rebuild their economies/manpower is ridiculous. I’m also not expecting a complex system this early in EA development. I imagine the devs have so much on their plate right now it’s disgusting, god speed devs."
Conservative,fqz4y62,t1_fqyzi9k,1589759995.0,"Putting words into their mouth by being obviously sarcastic quoting?? It’s almost as if I made a characterization of his argument in an extreme fashion and expected people to realize that instead of thinking it was a legitimate point, no wonder liberals don’t take people like you seriously tbh"
Conservative,fqz4cvb,t1_fqyylq9,1589759697.0,"You just said they’re making frivolous demands? Either own up to what you said or rescind the ignorant comment. I also like you how ignore the rest of the comment that blatantly overturns your ignorance. You don’t need to respond because you don’t have one, I wasn’t expecting any retort past your first comment because it was so obviously low effort"
Conservative,fqyxjfz,t1_fqyw1fb,1589756271.0,"And we’re allowed to call you a child for not taking the situation seriously. Being facetious doesn’t do anything besides make you look like an asshole and someone who isn’t intellectually rigorous enough to have a conversation let alone hold an independent, critical observation instead of going “HaHa u want to kill ur grandma if u go outside LOL111!!” Imagine defining ‘demand’ as a request for personal freedom"
Conservative,fqyu9tk,t3_glbe5c,1589754660.0,It’s crazy how he said nothing but typed out so much. Imagine implying the government should control your quality of life and not yourself??? How do you even get to that mindset?
Imperator,fqyu3lz,t3_glknt0,1589754575.0,"Ehh, you might wanna do the math on some of those civilization policies. I think you MIGHT still be able to do it? It’s really hard to tell how quickly you’ll get max civilization, sometimes the random events help a fuck ton"
Conservative,fqytge6,t1_fqy26y8,1589754274.0,"Obama was the greatest president EVER, he honestly fabricated THE best healthcare systems the world has ever seen, with only his own massive brain. And tbh, it was so patriotic of him to sell weapons to unstable middle eastern kingdoms that he totally didn’t escalate relations into a conflict with /s"
Conservative,fqysrd9,t3_gligcx,1589753942.0,"There is honestly no chance Omar wins re election. She already looks like she’s losing the district this year according to polls. I dislike propaganda polls as much as anyone else, but with videos of her kid calling US soldiers baby killers and terrorists... I don’t see a sane minded American voting for someone who *literally* hates our country and founding principles."
Conservative,fqyrxiy,t1_fqyh4ad,1589753547.0,"So in a society with free speech people aren’t allowed to air their grievances without people like you creating an entire cult community to shame them? Oh ok, yea I forgot we live in communist Russia please just ship me off to the gulag for not using the correct compelled speech to appease my federal bureaucracy. Imagine actually condemning wanting to pay for a service in a capitalist society LMAO"
INTP,fqyoejn,t1_fqwazp7,1589751891.0,Just because an opinion is negative or hurts feelings does NOT mean it doesn’t need to be said or heard. Implicating feelings are more important than objective statements or opinions is absurd and a form of fascism. Compelled speech by feelings will never be a condoning factor to free speech
INTP,fqyil60,t1_fqx5mjk,1589749167.0,"This is honestly just typical INTP behavior, nothing says  ENTP here. This person boss is stereotypical in many ways to INTP"
Imperator,fqyfwxa,t3_glfupr,1589747937.0,"Honestly the standing armies legit kills the game for me. Tribes and non republics/kingdoms have permanent armies that NEVER retire retinues? For real?? Every 25 years in a republic a retinue should retire. Only empires and large kingdoms/republics should be able to afford standing armies. The historical accounts for standing armies is so far and few between in this time period we have legit 5 or 6 countries as an example of them, and none of them worked like Imperator currently functions"
Conservative,fqxl1uy,t1_fqxiebh,1589733950.0,"I don’t think you even understand what you’re talking about. The fact that he ISNT ashamed that he’s rich IS appealing. Democrats have this psuedo hate-dependency on rich/billionaires. They hate and want to abolish them, but rely on them to fund their campaigns and kowtow to them when they aren’t calling for their entire wealth to be redistributed. No, Trump is loved exactly because he has the bravado to accept himself as a rich man who understands the plight of the average man."
Conservative,fqxknqf,t1_fqxd7mj,1589733777.0,Are you implying you have to be of the same cloth to share grievances? Are you implying that people who come from different life experiences can’t understand the angers and passions of others?
Conservative,fqxjytc,t1_fqxa53c,1589733462.0,"Not only did you just fabricate that statistic, you didn’t even use it very well to push your point. Freedom is the ultimate joy in life. The pursuit of happiness is the expectation of freedom."
