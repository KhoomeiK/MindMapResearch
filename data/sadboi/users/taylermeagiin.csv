It's incredibly hard on him and he can be very overbearing to the point of being unhelpful, but it's because he's scared. I'm not in your relationship so I can't say what his fears/feelings are around this, but it's important to remember that he isn't trained to deal with this.

If he's not helping, go see someone who can help:

A) you learn how to communicate what you need 
B) provide you the tools/support to fight this thing
C) get the two of you in the same room for couples therapy or is willing to work with both of you on a 1-1 basis to help come up with a plan of action.


This thing is so difficult to deal with, especially if you don't have the right support systems in place. I'd 1000% encourage you do dive in and tackle this before it gets worse. Xxx"

EatingDisorders,ey94n85,t3_cw27d1,1566935149.0,"Agree with all of the above comments. Her ED already convinces her, I assume, that everyone is working against her and the only thing she can trust is that ED voice, and disregarding her boundaries will only validate that and she may withdraw even more.

I'm currently recovering after 10 years, and it's been super helpful to have:

A) Someone to talk to openly during mealtimes. My husband talks to me via text for 2 hours a day over lunch to help logically argue those thoughts and remind me why I'm fighting against this. 

B) Having someone to not only support you, but to play devil's advocate for the ED voice. Having people ask me ""why/how does that help you?"" or ""would that make any sense if someone were saying that to your sister?"" helps add a little logic to the situation.

C) Having people work with me on reminders of what the illness takes from me (ability to work, improve at work, socialize, hair, organ failure, etc) and what I gain with recovery (freedom, my identity, feelings, real control over my life, etc.).

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, SHE has to want this for herself. Unfortunately, it doesn't work any other way. Forced IP is never a go-to, but it's a good thing to consider if she's medically unstable or at risk of organ shutdown.

I'm 8 months in and, while the thoughts and body image issues haven't gone away at all, they are far easier to cope with.

&#x200B;

One of the manipulations that EDs put up is that you can only be happy at X weight or if you look like X. But, you already know that it's never going to be good enough for your ED to let you be happy. There's no amount of weight you could lose that would make your life better & improve your body image as long as that ED is hanging around.

&#x200B;

My therapist tells me that it's a matter of rebuilding the trust my body has in me. I've neglected & punished it for so long that it wants to hold onto EVERYTHING I eat because it doesn't know when I'm going to starve it again. Eventually, if you stick with recovery and don't restrict/compensate, your body will settle at its set point. While you don't get to decide what that is, you do have the option of changing the thoughts on your body as it works its way there.

One thing I've found helpful is recognizing when I'm tearing my body apart & forcing myself to redirect the thoughts from ""my legs are massive"" to ""my legs have carried me through half marathons. They get me to class."" and ""this food is going to make me even bigger"" to ""I need this food to help my brain think, my body perform functions to keep me alive, and keep my moods/mental health level.

The only way out is through, but it does get easier with time. I highly, highly recommend reaching out to a therapist, dietician, and/or support group to help get you through this. ANAD & NEDA have quite a few :)"

>So now I have gained weight. I am told I look super healthy. I feel so uncomfortable. I have such a hard time accepting it. That I have to eat. That the weight I gained is good. I have to eat though so I don't have anxiety spikes. I saw a friend post about losing weight and my first thought was working out and not eating.

The #1 thing to remember is that this ED is manipulative. It wants to isolate you, refuse to let you have something that you NEED to stay alive, and make you think that it's the only thing that makes sense. It is absolutely not true.

I'm currently in recovery, too, and the weight restoration is rough, man. I feel this. It helps me to think of the weight gain as a ""side effect"" of recovery and focus on the other things you gain once you're not obsessing over food (connections, relationships, having emotions again, etc).

>So I talked to a therapist about it. It feels like I am at the bottom of a mountain right now. I don't even feel like I can say I have an ed. I feel like a fraud. I feel scared when I can't have food. I feel angry at having to eat it. I don't know how to feel about my body. I don't know what's me.

>I just can‚Äôt seem to convince myself that I can eat the recommended amount of calories and not put on a shit ton of weight. 

You'll gain initially, but just because your body doesn't trust you to feed it right now. It thinks it has to hold on to everything, so it will until it feels like it can trust you to nourish it. That's *exactly* the reason to not restrict. Aside from it making training properly really hard to do, you're just feeding right back into that mistrust. Not to mention, you run the risk of doing some serious damage to your body. 

I put on 50ish lbs when I started to recover and it leveled out over time but only after I started eating enough consistently. 

&#x200B;

>But I‚Äôm also overweight and want to at least be in the normal bmi range. But I also just feel like it would be so much easier to just eat less.

Falling back into ED thoughts/habits is 10000% more harmful & unhealthy than a high BMI/weight. Plus, a healthy weight is different from person to person, and if you're restricting then your body isn't able to find its set point. It's too worried about saving energy for the next ""famine"" if that makes sense? 

&#x200B;

>Particularly of note... I‚Äôm back at home for 3 weeks with my mum so essentially no friends that know about this to keep an eye on me, no psychologist, no uni to distract me and a mum who is very judgemental about eating and actively encourages dieting

If you're already thinking this way, that's another huge red flag. EDs thrive in isolation, and that's a slippery slope that I really hope you can keep yourself away from.

&#x200B;

Totally normal! Your body has a TON of internal damage to repair and it desperately needs the calories to do so. On top of needing to repair, your body doesn't trust you to feed it consistently yet so it's trying to get the nutrients it needs now so that it can take care itself during the upcoming ""famine"". Absolutely honor those hunger cues! I would eat upwards of 5k calories a day for months after I started with the crazy hunger cues. [Tabitha Farrar](https://tabithafarrar.com/2017/01/extreme-hunger-anorexia-recovery/) & [Mia](https://www.instagram.com/whatmiadidnext/) both have amazing resources for this :) 

&#x200B;

>My stomach looks like I am 6 months pregnant and im experiencing severe constipation. I don‚Äôt even want to leave the house at this point because of how I look. Is all of this normal? 

Yep - but I know it isn't fun. Your digestion slows when you aren't eating enough/consistently, and it's going to take some time for your system to repair and kick back into gear. The trick here is drinking plenty of fluids, hot baths, and heating pads :) Please remember to keep an eye out for signs of refeeding syndrome. You'll need to go to the ER asap if you start to notice these as it can be deadly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Whatever you do, just don't restrict. Your body is healing and learning to trust you again. You wouldn't hack off a cast and try to run on a leg you broke a week ago, and this is similar. If you can, reach out to get support through a therapist, BetterHelp, or ANAD Support Group near you. EDs are so much more than physical and, although weight gain and restoration are 100000% crucial, it isn't going to bring you all the way to recovery. Please always feel free to reach out if you need anything! I'm in recovery as well and I know it can be rough."
