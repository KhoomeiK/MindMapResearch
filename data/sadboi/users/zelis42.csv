Judaism,fpl40vv,t1_fpkvhsd,1588705974.0,"I'm so sorry your family isn't supportive. 

You are going to feel anxiety as well as the traditional Catholic Guilt about exploring this. Talk to the rabbi about it. Talk to your friends. Talk to other congregants. You will not survive this process if you don't have a community around you. You are changing something that has likely been part of your identity. This is huge. It's scary. It's okay to be anxious.

Catholicism is more than a religion: it's a culture. There are traditions and superstitions that come with being a craddle Catholic. And just like with any culture, there are going to be remnants of it in your life. I want to assure you that you don't have to give them all up. Don't force it. I literally made myself ill trying to because I felt I couldn't be a ""good Jewish wife"" if kept those habits and sentimental items.

Lastly, I want to stress that you can meet and speak to a rabbi whether or not you're sure you want to convert. Wanting to learn more about Judaism in a structured manner is a completely valid reason to email a rabbi. Some of them even have specific classes for that kind of thing. You can also set the pace. If you need to slow down the process, you can. If it gets to the point where you're just not sure you want to do this, *that's okay.* Go at your own speed.

A lot of people consider PPD to be on a scale of ""baby blues"" to ""PPP."" If we go by this scale, then yes, one needs to have the diagnosis of PPD to have PPP.

There's also a heavy link between PPP and bipolar disorder. There's an entire school of thought that PPP is actually a very manic episode post-birth. So following this school of thought, once again, yes, you would have to have bipolar (generally considered a form of depression) to have PPP.

There's also a subtype of Major Depression that presents with psychosis, so some doctors may consider this to essentially be that subtype for PPD.

However, there are other places that list it as separate: PPA, PPD, and PPP are three separate postpartum mental health issues. Postpartum International is one of these places.

Now, to assuage your fears:

PPP comes on **suddenly.** Like, within 72 hours of delivery. If you've made it two weeks after delivery, you're not going to get it.

PPP is temporary.

PPP is treatable.

The most important thing I want you to know is that mental illness doesn't present the same way in everyone. Think of the last time you had a cold. You probably had a runny nose, a headache, a sore throat, a cough. I did, too. But my runny nose was very congestion related, whereas yours may have been dripping. My sore throat was my worst symptom; yours may have been the cough.

Illnesses affect us differently because of who we are. Our body chemistry, our habits, our lifestyles can all impact how we present to the world.

If you do have bipolar, it won't change who you are. It won't mean you're destined to be just like your mother. It means that you are still Questionmypresence, but now you have a diagnostic code so your insurance will cover treatment."
mentalillness,fjd5egc,t3_fcsxw9,1583246058.0,"This is tangently related to my area of research (mass media's impact on social behavior), so I may go a bit overboard.

The term ""cluster effect"" is primarily used when referring to suicidal behavior and the impact on the people involved. This is specifically referred to as the Werther Effect when it follows mass media coverage of a suicide (think after the coverage of Robin Williams, Anthony Bourdain, Chris Cornell, Chester Bennington, etc.). It's also currently being examined as a possibility with mass shootings.

For the rest of the disorders on your list, I recommend looking how behavior and mood spreads among friend groups. Including studies about behaviors such as smoking and vaccination will actually back up your hypothesis here, because these are behaviors whose spread among social circles is well-established. You're essentially showing this behavior spread exists, and then widening that behavior to include those that are associated with mental illness.

DuggarsSnark,fjbh41y,t1_fjavqh1,1583193146.0,"That article says Narcanon has been approved for Amazon Smile donations.

According to Amazon, this is all you have to do to be eligible for the program:

>Registering your organization is easy. In order to register and receive donations, you must be an official representative of an eligible organization, and then follow these easy steps: 

> *Search for your charitable organization by name or EIN number and then select the organization you represent. Be sure to confirm you are selecting the correct organization, as many charitable organizations have similar names. 

> *Create an organization administrator account and accept the AmazonSmile Participation Agreement on behalf of your organization. 

> *Verify your email address (we recommend that you use an email address that is associated with your charitable organization).

> *Submit your organization’s bank account information.

> *Upload a copy of a voided check or bank statement to verify your organization’s bank account information.

Given how easy it is for an organization to join this program, I think it may be a bit of a stretch to say Amazon has ""links"" to Scientology."
Judaism,fjaejxp,t3_fcbs1f,1583171874.0,"I really like the people at [Shir Tikvah](https://www.shirtikvah.org/). They're Reform/Reconstruction, very small and family-like, and super welcoming. Their primary service is on Friday, but they have Torah study and get togethers most Saturdays. They also have a lovely variety of observance levels, so if you want people to lay t'fillin with, you can find them.

[Temple Beth El](https://www.tbeonline.org/) was a bit crowded for my taste, but because they're much bigger, they have a lot more going on. They also live stream their services, which may make things easier on you with your work schedule.

HyperemesisGravidarum,fj6rv0g,t3_fbn40v,1583078804.0,"Your story could easily be mine, and probably a lot of the other subscribers'. I had my first appointment at 7 weeks, 5 days. I mentioned I was struggling with nausea. 3 days later I was in the hospital because of fluid loss.

I don't have much advice for getting through work (I freelance, so I've been taking time off). I do have some tips for general survival, though.

Here's what I want you to know:

It's okay to struggle. It's okay to cry, and to have thoughts of abortion. It's okay to be bent over a toilet or trashcan at 3am and find yourself wishing for a miscarriage.

It's okay. It doesn't make you a bad mother. I cannot stress that enough. It doesn't mean you're evil, or that you're betraying this little bean that you so desperately wanted 8 weeks ago.

No matter what: you are a good person, and you are doing the best you can.

People will judge you. People will give you shitty, unwelcome advice. These people sometimes include the doctors and nurses treating you, unfortunately. They don't know a damn thing.

My tips that got me through:

* Give up on water for now. It's a losing battle. You can try again later, once you're on a medication regimen that works.

* Instead of water, try fruit juices (apple juice worked best for me, others have had luck with orange and pineapple).

* Also try soda. Coke, Sprite, Vernors. Especially in slushie form.

* Crushed ice may stay down better than water, too.

* Strategize around what is easiest to throw up. Almond milk doesn't curdle in your stomach like regular milk, so it may be a good switch during your worst weeks. Soups tend to come up easily, too.

* If you have a craving, go for it. You may regret it later, but it will be oh so satisfying at the time, which is better for your mental health.

* If you're on medications, see if you can get them in liquid form. Again, this is for ease of vomiting.

* Are you on antidepressants? If you're not, I heavily recommend considering them. HG kills your mental health, too.


Right now, my dear, you are in the absolute worst of it, and it is a hell so few people understand. You're still trying to figure out what med regimen will work the best, and you're experiencing the HG stealing the early pregnancy joy you are entitled to have.

I'm 23+4 right now. I'm not going to tell you it goes away. I still have really bad weeks. But I will tell you that it gets a little better. You **will** have days where you're not vomiting or nauseated every second. You **will** have days where you can nest and go shopping and look forward to the milestones.

I'm also going to tell you to just try and hang on until your anatomy scan. The first scan, the first time you hear the heartbeat? Meh. But that anatomy scan, when you see the baby sucking on fingers and toes, doing flips. That will make it real. That will help you see exactly who you're fighting for. I was able to get mine done closer to 18 weeks rather than 20. See if your doctor will let you do that, too.

No one can really prepare you for how isolating this illness can be. I hope, if nothing else, this sub can help alleviate some of that."

mentalillness,fj0db49,t3_faq8ic,1582897075.0,"Thoughts of self-harm aren't always thoughts of cutting, burning, and headbanging. Sometimes thoughts of self-harm are urges to engage in behaviors we know aren't the best decision. A recovering alcoholic may have thoughts of drinking, for example. These are thoughts that wouldn't warrant a second glance in most people, but for this particular person, it's a huge deal. So yes, you're right that the urge to cheat is a form of self harm.

Right now, you're going through a really tough time. A relationship you counted on is strained. You don't even have comfy couch to vegetate on, let alone a home to go to. This is enough to cause *anyone* to struggle.

It's hard to stay strong when we're in positions like you've found yourself in.

Are there alternatives you think could help? Even unhealthy ones. (One of mine was smoking, so I seriously have no room to judge you.) Maybe hobbies, like photography? A phone camera is more than enough to get started. Bowling leagues usually aren't too expensive, either."

All mental illness exists on a spectrum, and anxiety's spectrum is **huge.** You have the anxiety most people think of, all the way to agoraphobics who cannot leave their houses, to obsessive-compulsives washing their hands bloody, to, yes, paranoia.

However, this sounds like it's starting to interfere with your life. I recommend bringing this up to a doctor or therapist. Your primary care doctor should be able to at least prescribe SSRIs, if you want to try them. A school counselor can assess you further.

I wish you luck."

A good antidepressant won't take away all the sadness. You may still have days when the depression kicks in. However, your base mood will go from \_\_\_here___ to ---here---. So, ideally, you'll be able to cope better when those days happen.

You say you haven't felt any change this month. Do you mean from last month, or do you feel as though you're slipping back into depression? Antidepressants change your baseline. They don't make you constantly happy. The change you felt in the first month may have been your body hitting its new normal, and you won't feel any more change from these medications at this dosage."

FundieSnark,fifabf4,t1_fif076t,1582387632.0,"In general, ""term"" is considered 38-42 weeks. Once you hit 41 weeks, they monitor baby more closely.

At 42 weeks, there's significantly higher chance of complications. And the longer you go past that, the higher chance there is of low amneotic fluid, that the placenta is no longer nourishing baby, infections and so on.

Without induction, 11 in 1,000 babies will be born with breathing issues associated with inhaling meconium.

Baby will be bigger, so there's higher chance of trauma to mom during delivery, too. More severe vaginal tearing, and hemorrhaging, mostly.

And yes, there's also a higher chance of baby dying during delivery - about 4-7 in 1,000. So it's not definite, but the odds do increase the longer you stay pregnant.

Most doctors will induce by 42 weeks to avoid all of these potentials."
