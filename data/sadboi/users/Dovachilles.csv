erectiledysfunction,fozpckk,t3_ga5cbu,1588194524.0,"I am going through nearly the exact same thing. I stopped drinking, smoking & I'm trying to change my lifestyle to be healthier. Working out helps me feel better about myself and after 2 weeks of keeping to no porn/masterbating & stopping the alcohol/ drugs I've been feeling much better. Im not saying that it is a fix but you can also talk to a medical professional that will help you rule out if it is physical or psychological. I do believe that stress is the number one reason im having these issues though,  maybe your situation is similar? Goodluck!"

Why judge him? You're on the same thread so clearly we are all here for different reasons. Sorry you feel the need to put others down for no reason, stupid."

relationship_advice,f2ah9bb,t3_dcrj2o,1570113313.0,I realized that I can do most all that stuff with the person I love. Most times I would check girls out and want to leave to experience other people and new situations but in the end I always tell myself that I can always do those things with her and I think about what I have before I risk it. Why would I throwaway something so valuable to me for a little bit of fun that won't do anything these years of love and trust has. I think the main thing to do is thing of what is really important to YOU and determine what you would be happier with.

I was verbally abusive, even slightly physically (not beating anyone, just when I was angry and she tried to touch me I would squeeze her till she pulled away in pain) I'm not proud if it. I was completely self destructive and I would take anyone down with me. I met a girl in high school and tbh she changed me, half was due to her working hard on understanding me and talking to me. The other half was realizing someone cared enough to get hurt by me in Hopes that I get better. That selflessness made me want to change and I did an entire 180. We've been together 4 years and friends for 5 years. Some people can change for the better, I think. Of course there are a lot if variables involved but hey it is what it is. Definitely take care of yourself before anyone else or you might get into a horrible cycle."
