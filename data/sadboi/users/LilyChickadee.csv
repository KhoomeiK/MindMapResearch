For instance, for me, a combination of a traumatic childhood as well as hormonal fluctuations from PMDD make me behave very erratically sometimes. Now that I know, I understand how to deal with the symptoms and don’t fall into a ball of self hatred.

I think it’s telling that you call yourself a “baby” and think you need to toughen up. One way to help with emotional regulation is to be kind to yourself. Develop a relationship with yourself as a trusted, loving mentor. Tell yourself it’s okay to feel the way you do, and be curious as to the why. 

Get “stronger” by being more vulnerable, kind, and loving to the person inside that is hurting."

I despise MRA as well. But at least their label is pretty consistent with their beliefs, and I can know to stay away with them.

With feminism, if you call anyone out, you are banned or told that you are wrong and made to feel uneducated and unenlightened. If someone tells me they are a feminist I have to ask them, okay, what does that mean? Because everyone has different meanings, and I’m not going to fight for the all encompassing feminism when that means things like telling trans women they are not women and saying that all men should be kept away from children because you never know what they’ll do.

It is extremely sad to me, as a woman, that the best place I can find for any sort of gendered discourse is on a subreddit for men. That is not men’s fault by the way. 

I think there needs to be an entirely new movement where both sexes seek to support and understand each other and themselves. We are all god damned humans after all.

Getting my mother in a safe space where she won’t kill herself or others and end up in jail. If that takes involuntary commitment and forced injection of antipsychotics, that’s a far lesser evil than the loss of two lives—or the trauma of my mother coming to in a prison realizing what she’s done.

Interpretations like yours don’t take into account the severely mentally ill—the schizoffective a and schizophrenics. And I’m sorry, but the family absolutely should get a say.

PsychMelee,fqyibpj,t3_glfqrl,1589749042.0,"Thank you for this. I truly believe almost all mental illnesses come from extreme trauma. I am not sure about schizophrenia or schizoaffective, but I do believe that could be the case as well.

I was diagnosed bipolar after depression due to an extremely traumatic life and abusive relationship. Because my mother is schizoaffective, and because the antidepressants literally made me feel like I was high (on drugs), they continued to throw drugs at me. One drug doesn’t work? Let’s add two more to offset the symptoms.

I went from graduating cum laude and being promoted 4 times in 3 years to exactly what the doctors told me I was—crazy. I don’t know how many drugs I was on but things such as seizures, memory loss—including forgetting basic words and how to spell, agoraphobia, anxiety so bad I had to lay in bed for hours in the dark every single day. Bird song made me think of nothing but death. 

I was told these side effects were worth it.

This is an issue of traumatized people becoming victims and retraumatized for profit. It is predation on a large scale. Who better to make money from than gullible people with low self worth desperate for answers. My medicine cost me 200 a month, with insurance.

I am not totally anti med. my schizoaffective mother does need them. Though, I wonder how many have made her worse than better. 

I have been off for 6 months and gradually feel again. I cry, get angry, feel joy. I can read, watch tv, walk outside... i enjoy birdsong now. I still have lingering effects, the withdrawal is real. The only time I had anything close to mania was because of the drugs themselves.

For instance, go to any gendered space of Reddit and argue with things that are objectively false. In a feminist space, I was downvoted to hell for saying that not all men are rapists. I was even banned!

In a male rights space, I was downvoted for... a lot of things. Saying that women had less rights in history, that they still have less rights in the middle east, the list goes on. Probably hundreds of downvotes.

If I ever see someone misrepresenting mental illness (especially schizophrenia, which my mom has) there is a very real possibility I will be downvoted. 

Is there something you feel the strong need to defend? To me, it feels GOOD to argue with people who are toxic or hold toxic beliefs. I am transferring some feelings of righteous anger and justice, and the downvotes/bans make me laugh.

There are certain spaces in reddit where, if you say, “nazis are bad” you will get downvoted to oblivion and called all sorts of names. 

Understand that MOST people are not well educated and even fewer are in touch with their emotions/empathy. I promise, if you’re getting downvotes, you are absolutely doing something right—your stating your opinion and no one can tell you that’s wrong, they can just not like it.

It maybe be a good exercise to find things you are absolutely passionate about and willing to defend. I think it’s a great step to valuing your own opinion above others.

If men are emotionally immature, it’s because they do not feel comfortable expressing those emotions and have never digested/looked or even acknowledged those emotions.

Honestly, the texts you send out are pretty insulting. Are you a man or a woman?”

And yes I called out this sub because it sucks."
LeftWingMaleAdvocates,fqlum9j,t1_fqlue11,1589466371.0,"Lol, maybe read my comments and see if you disagree with them? I’ve been banned from gendercritical, feminism, and FDS. Though FDS was actually for standing up for other women."
LeftWingMaleAdvocates,fqlucdn,t1_fqlt9bd,1589466226.0,"Yeah I’m literally pointing that out, that was the point of that comment. What are you trying to say?"
LeftWingMaleAdvocates,fqlu8z4,t1_fqltg7z,1589466176.0,Discuss what? I too have been banned from feminist spaces for standing up for men.
LeftWingMaleAdvocates,fqlsl0l,t1_fqlrrkl,1589465278.0,"LOL you acted like it was a movement so I genuinely wanted to know, maybe you meant gender critical? “feminism is a religious extremist group” I mean, its toxic af, but dear god 😂😂😂

I’m not trying to make myself a victim, it’s very clear here. The PMs show this place is ACTUALLY misogynistic. I mean, that’s pretty clear from the thinly veiled attempts to discredit all of women’s history but... pretty clear. 

I’ll stop cosplaying if you stop your patronizing and toxic bullshit."
LeftWingMaleAdvocates,fqlry7y,t1_fqlreqi,1589464926.0,"People conflate personal trauma for sexism. I saw this very clearly on gendercritical, where those women are so terrified of men that they can’t even accept trans women. 

I am able to understand women’s side more because to me it comes from actual fear of men. I have been in several abusive relationships and it is very easy for me to get sucked into the trauma narrative. It feels good and makes me have power.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on how men do the same thing. I’m not a male so I can’t say, but I think men are traumatized by being told they are bad and evil and rapists (mostly by traumatized feminists). 

So women get abused, take their anger out on all men and also maybe traumatized other women to believe all men are predators, this traumatizes men who then lash back out at women. That’s what I’ve gathered. Hurt people hurt people, at least those that don’t acknowledge the hurt and get help, and it seems it’s a never ending circle of the sexes hurting each other. I am open for (civil) discussion at any time."

Men’s Rights—well those movement are pretty fucked unfortunately. Leftwingmensrights believes all women oppressions are feminist propaganda and history is a conspiracy theory"
LeftWingMaleAdvocates,fqlq53b,t1_fqlgvlv,1589463919.0,"I agree with these arguments, I don’t agree with people who claim oppression for women did not exist throughout history."

LeftWingMaleAdvocates,fqlplb3,t1_fqloyws,1589463604.0,"No, I’m sick of arguing. I don’t believe men are all perpetrators of violence and I do believe that women can commit violence. My sister in law constantly physically attacked my brother and then cried “mental health” so that she was let out in 72 hours. Lol you don’t get that if it weren’t for the fact that you feel the need for history to be rewritten, I would be on your side. It’s very obvious people here are bitter towards women. 

The best thing for these movements would be for everyone to deal with their trauma, go to therapy, and sort out their own shit before projecting all of their hurt on another sex. I mean that about feminism too."
LeftWingMaleAdvocates,fqlp80r,t1_fqlp24x,1589463388.0,"Alright. Let’s talk about those issues instead, and not say that history is some giant conspiracy theory made up by feminists."
LeftWingMaleAdvocates,fqlovr5,t1_fqlnzgf,1589463181.0,"Yes, and the opposite is true, if I say most attempts are by women it is often brought up that more men commit suicide. I haven’t said that btw... but I have seen many unpopular opinions and off my chests that say “men actually kill themselves more frequently than women and women get all of the help.”

I can promise you, people who are severely mentally ill are equally fucked by the shitty excuse we have of health care."
