SkincareAddiction,fplome6,t3_ge3ncy,1588716529.0,"I have similar skin to you and I used to use the Cetaphil Cleanser for years. It was ok. I recently switched to the Cerave foaming cleanser and find that it is much more effective and is less harsh. 

If you’re looking for a moisturizer for oily skin, I suggest Clinique’s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel. Make sure to pick the gel and not the lotion. It’s better for oily skin. It has a matte finish so it doesn’t look greasy and I find it to be great at controlling oil production throughout the day. I don’t get super oily anymore. 

Remember what works for me won’t necessarily work for you!"
SkincareAddiction,fplnvbx,t3_ge2xoc,1588716127.0,"This does look like a cyst. Continue with your normal routine twice a day and it will go away with time. Just try to refrain from touching or picking at it. That will make it much worse. Benzoyl Peroxide as a spot treatment on cystic acne does help! Be careful to avoid using a lot of products that strip your skin though. Focus on hydrating your skin. This will help prevent and treat acne. I also recently experienced something similar and freaked out. After doing my skincare routine, I then ice the cyst for a little. This helps with pain and inflammation."

BPD,fovw7mt,t3_g9smkr,1588108598.0,"I can relate. I used to have an existential crisis all the time because I couldn’t tell if what I was feeling was valid or if I was overreacting and making up much worse scenarios and things in my head. I felt like I was going crazy. There’s a term in literature called an unreliable narrator. I felt like the unreliable narrator of my own life and I still sometimes feel that way. 

However, I also have been in relationships with people and have had family members who like to gaslight me and invalidate my feelings. Try to be aware of people like this. I feel like those who struggle with BPD are particularly vulnerable to being gaslighted."
BPD,fopfc46,t3_g8f0qw,1587960043.0,"Regulating my emotions seems impossible most of the time. I’m still learning to work on not letting my emotions run my life. One mechanism I use whenever I’m feeling very emotionally reactive is to count to 10 in my head before I say or do something. It sounds silly but it has actually helped. This gives me a little time to think before I speak or act so I don’t say or do anything really damaging. 

I also kind of had to learn the hard way to focus on regulating my emotions better. I’ve done some crazy shit while super emotional and I almost lost my boyfriend because of it. It was a wake up call. I have a huge fear of abandonment that causes me to lash out emotionally when those feelings get triggered. However, through trial and error I began to realize that being emotionally reactive tends to actually push people a way. So I’ve really forced myself to handle things better in order to avoid losing the people I love. I know it’s easier said than done!! Like I said, it took me acting like a totally maniac to realize that I needed to chill or else. It takes time but recognizing the problem is the first step!!"
BPD,fopeg6b,t1_fopdgxh,1587959419.0,"I appreciate your condolences. It was really hard and it definitely impacts my life still. However, I’ve come to terms with it and time has healed a lot of the pain. If you or anyone else reading this is struggling with trauma due to your parent(s), check out @the.holistic.psychologist on Instagram!!! She’s a great resource for healing from trauma, working to avoid codependency in relationships, and doing work to heal your inner child. Her work has helped me a ton."
BPD,fopdb7i,t3_g8i23f,1587958634.0,I don’t feel like my BPD is caused by rejection from a parent. I know it is!! My mother was unstable and neglectful. Put me through a lot of trauma due to her personal struggles with mental health and drug addiction. She packed up and left right before I turned 13. That definitely fucked me up.
UNLV,fonsm1m,t3_g5yuiv,1587925658.0,"Speaking for law admissions, at the end of the day your numbers matter the most. Either way your GPA is amazing and neither an A- or an S on your transcript will hurt you. With a 4.0 or a 3.99 and a decent-good LSAT score, you’ve got a great shot pretty much anywhere. This isn’t just me guessing. This is a well known fact!! (Check out r/lawschooladmissions) and you’ll understand this.

BTW what no one mentioned and should have is that one or two S’s on your transcripts are not going to matter at all. Admissions only start to look at things like “S/U” or “W” grades and grade trends if your numbers aren’t stellar and they need to pick between you and someone else with the same numbers. However, you always have the opportunity to explain these things on you application. The admissions process is holistic but the greatest emphasis is on GPA and LSAT scores.

If you’re interested in law school, you should be checking out incoming class profiles of the schools you’re interested in and comparing your numbers. Law schools have to share these numbers. Most people try to aim for the median numbers of the school they want to go to. The median GPA at the Yale law (#1 ranked law school) is a 3.93. The top 25% of their incoming class had a 3.99 GPA. Even with a 3.99, your GPA is competitive for the top law program in the nation!!

I hope you see how in your case, you’re set either way.

I can’t speak to all other grad programs, but I know that they just don’t want to see an “S” in classes pertaining to the grad program (I.e. an S in Econ if you’re applying for an Econ masters). Also numbers play a huge role in admissions, not just for law school. You can always call the schools you’re interested in and just ask them about it."
UNLV,fonqadv,t3_g8akbi,1587924371.0,"My opinion is going to different greatly from everyone else. You’re in the UNLV forum, so people are going to defend UNLV. If you post the same question in the UCSD forum, everyone is going to tell you to pick UCSD. You need to keep that in mind.

In your post you mention that you got into University of San Diego (USD) but then you kept saying UCSD (UC San Diego). Those are two different schools. If you got into UCSD, pick that over UNLV. If you got into USD, pick UNLV. 

I’m not trashing UNLV’s bio program but you’re just not going to get the same quality of education, especially in STEM. Just like you mentioned, UCSD is known for their STEM programs especially bio!! You’re going to get a lot more out of studying STEM at UCSD. It’s not to say that you’ll hate it here at UNLV but I truly believe you will enjoy the UCSD experience so much more. You need to think of college as an investment. UCSD is worth it for STEM. I believe UCSD will prepare you a lot more than UNLV for med school. However, like others mention, you can go to UNLV undergrad and than apply to UCSD med (an amazing school also)!! 

I think you need to think really hard about this decision. I know going into debt is scary but you need to pick your investments wisely and I believe UCSD is an amazing school. I’m sure you will absolutely love it there. Everyone I know who goes to UCSD loves it but I definitely cannot say the same about people who got to UNLV."
BPD,foec7zp,t3_g6vzu9,1587700383.0,"It took me a while to realize this but stay away from people who cannot sit down and listen to your feelings with respect. It doesn’t mean he has to agree with how you feel but he needs to at least be able to sit down and communicate in a healthy manner. You do not want to be stuck in a situation with someone who refuses to communicate and shuts down emotionally when you express emotion. It’s an incredibly challenging situation to be in especially if you struggle with BPD. It will trigger intense feelings of abandonment and you deserve security. 

I’ve been in a similar situation where when I found out that my now ex still watched porn I felt super insecure. After working a little on my self esteem, I realized watching porn while in a relationship doesn’t automatically mean that you think partner your partner is inadequate. However, I do find it strange that he wants to jerk off in the bathroom when you’re there and he could engage with you instead. I would be wary of that. Also his ultimatum to you was manipulative and not ok."
BPD,foe92fc,t3_g6plmg,1587698532.0,"I’ve struggled with mental health issues since age 10-11. By age 16 I felt like it was clear that I struggled with BPD. However, I know a lot of therapists refuse to even consider diagnosing anyone under age 18 with BPD. So I was diagnosed with depression and cyclothymic disorder instead.

After my first semester of college I felt like I was losing my mind. My mental health was at the worst it’s ever been. I was first prescribed an antidepressant which triggered a whole different set of horrible symptoms (fuck Zoloft). My therapist then mentioned that she felt I was bipolar, and suggested that I should take mood stabilizers instead. So I was then prescribed a mood stabilizer (which didn’t end up helping at all and I weaned off of asap).

However! Even w/ her bipolar diagnosis, every single session she’d use BPD work books with me, would read me stories of those who have struggled with BPD to see if I could relate (I always did), and she would always say to me that I had “borderline tendencies”. She made it obvious that she felt like I struggled with BPD but for some reason refused to just flat out say it. It sucked because I always wanted her to just validate what seemed to be the big hard truth. That never happened and I stopped seeing her because she was just not the right therapist for me. 

What upset me the most was that I clearly struggled with BPD not bipolar disorder and I was still prescribed to take mood stabilizers to treat the bipolar disorder that I don’t even have. I think it’s messed up to allow a patient to take harsh mood stabilizing medications when you know that’s not the right solution for them!"
BorderlinePDisorder,fnvboxl,t3_fwkrp2,1587287254.0,"I never comment on here but I read your post and I just had to say something. I can’t help but laugh because I’m literally in the same boat. Last year, I impulsively got a lotus flower tattoo that I loved at first and then a month or two later I could not stand it and just wanted it to be gone. I should have removed it then but felt impatient and got it covered up with a huge dragon tattoo while hanging out one night with a friend who was getting their own tattoo done. I hate the cover up even more. Now I’m just waiting to get the whole thing removed. I always usually have to learn things the hard way. Not looking forward to the cost or pain of tattoo removal. Wish me luck."
UNLV,fm6wr6k,t3_ft9c87,1585805539.0,Does anyone know if this is just applicable to classes that had to transition from in person to online? Or do classes that were online already also have the ability to be petitioned for S/U grading?
