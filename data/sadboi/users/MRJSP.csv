MLBTheShow,fr4wdsf,t1_fr4sevj,1589898137.0,Relievers shouldn't have a big mix of pitches. Most relievers are one or two pitch guys. They give far to many pitchers a mix that they hardly ever throw on this game.

MLBTheShow,fqhca23,t3_gisud4,1589373820.0,What are they patching?
WEPES,fqh9vi0,t1_fqh8y5v,1589372101.0,"PES 2013 wasn't amazing but it was soooo much better than what we have now. Personally I believe the game is dead, Konami keep it going as it's an easy money maker but have no interest in making things better which is why we still have the same online matchmaking syster from 2007 and the same MyClub from when it was brought in. No content, no real improvement. Their focus is on the mobile market and they have all but abandoned the console market. PES is their only console game. They will not make any major changes to the game as they know it has it's fanbase and they are happy with that. Until another dev  comes into play they are just happy to float dead in the water feasting off of MTT's. Once they dry up PES will be gone."

WEPES,fqh8dqw,t1_fqh7pwk,1589370928.0,Although PES 2015 was a massive improvement to 14 IMO it was still a very flawed and broken game. Since they switch to the fox engine the game does not flow organically everything on rails and stuck in a poorly coded hell. PES 15 to this day actually you can just passing the ball around the back without the opposition getting close to getting it. All game play depth has gone. No variation or randomness. PES 2013 was the last PES I enjoyed. I only hang on now cos I really hate FIFA and love football so PES is the only option.

WEPES,fqh3ppv,t1_fqe2yv8,1589366751.0,They should have been done after PES 2014.  It was the worst football game ever made and they released it in no state to be released. Wasnt even a quarter done but they released it anyway. They have never recovered from that and the fox engine has been a complete disaster. Any other game would be long dead. This game survives off the name it got long ago and the fact fifa is the only alternative.
WEPES,fqe5ctg,t3_giet87,1589302011.0,Your team should not be playing at LV4 it's weak. Guy has safriiced his defence and bench. . You have forwards that wouldn't get into most 3 star teams and your best players are at CB? Still managed to hammer him LMAO. Congrats

WEPES,fqdua6p,t3_gi4kgy,1589296711.0,Last yr Legends were in GP boxes but this yr as a massive thank you to all the fans they have locked them in coin only boxes with very low odds where you can get duplicates. I would just like to thank Konami for their amazing decision and fantastic content.

I will play a guy much higher ranked than me and smash them a lot of the time.

MLBTheShow,fqdby6i,t3_gi7tqz,1589286042.0,The energy system is broken so there's no consequence in pitching starters out of the pen. This is one of the worst things about this game. I think SDS should really admit they've made a mistake and stop starters coming out of the pen.
