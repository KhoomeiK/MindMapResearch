Bad_Cop_No_Donut,ep3h27l,t1_ep2o8t4,1559022863.0,"Bootlickers? I don't think saying ""not all cops are bad"" is bootlicking. People aren't confined to be one-dimensional about the issue and be radically inclined to hate all cops. Quite honestly, any comments here defending cops, especially black ones, are very warranted. Some of the top comments are ridiculously racist and insinuate all black officers are subservient slaves to some fabricated white overlords. What happened in the video seems to be a complete misuse of authority and the officee should definitetly be relieved. However, its still ridiculous to assume an entire group of people are sub 80 iq textbook pitbull racists."
