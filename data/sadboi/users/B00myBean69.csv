In April this year, while on a college visit, I had a crazy panic attack and then had the same symptoms as you described here for awhile. While I haven't had as bad of a full blown panic attack like the initial one, my Dr. is pretty sure I have/now have general anxiety disorder and I have little episodes here and there while always being on edge in general. I used to be pretty chill and relaxed, but this change sent me for a loop. The VS makes my anxiety a lot worse, but when it is under control, it gets a little better. There have been a couple things that have helped a bit, including drinking Kava on a regular / semi-regular basis, using Kratom sparingly (particularly on bad days, but I know others use it more regularly), magnesium, CBDs, going full vegan from vegetarian and making sure I have a variety of plants, meditating, getting enough sleep and being on a regular schedule, and going to therapy. Working out has been the most effective treatment for all the related issues, I must say.  None of these directly help with VS though, but it does seem that the less anxious I am overall, the less prominent my VS is, as well as my mood affecting my general ability to ignore it. Its so weird to hear the same scenario that I have been facing, and its nice to know that I am not alone =\] Hope this helps, and let me know if there is anything that has worked for you to relieve at least some of the symptoms of your panic/anxiety/depression/VS. I have recently picked up Lion's Mane, but have not given it a whirl. Lmk if it works for you! Hope this was of some use for you, as I know I was scrounging around the net for a good while after my episode trying EVERYTHING to see what worked/didn't work."

Anxiety,ezgsj0v,t3_d12jan,1567900912.0,"I am just starting my PhD at Berkeley, and I am going through similar loops. Though i'm not on any specific medications, my attacks seem to be limiting my ability to focus. I was just at a coffee shop reading when I almost had a full blown panic attack. I was able to calm myself down, but if I were in front of a class teaching, I don't know if I would have been able to mask the panic I was feeling. 

The academy is stress full and hyper-anxiety inducing, but it also provides a certain form of relief and comfortableness that might be hard to find other places. I was teaching middle school after I got my master's, and it was hard for me to connect with a lot of my co-workers, because I wanted to talk about subject specific topics and super in-depth research all the time, but no one else was really on that wavelength, and this (coupled with the bureaucratic non-sense of teaching middle-school) was what actually sparked my full-blown panic attacks. I now have nightmares from that place, and an so grateful to be back among others who passionately obsess over my area of study as much as I do, and I love seeing the undergrads begin to heighten their levels of critical thinking as well. 

Of course, going to a normie job would relieve some of the tension of always trying to compete to read the newest research, publish in journals, participate in conferences, etc, but it just comes with a whole host of other problems. 

Performing in Academia while having harsh anxiety and semi-regular panic attacks is going to be new to me, as I had anxiety before but not full panic disorder till after my masters, but if you got through your PhD like this, I know I can too, and that means you can definitely teach as well, through it won't be easy. Just try not to be too hard on yourself, and make accommodations as necessary and do not feel bad about it. You went through a lot to get to where you are, and you have a lot to give back. Don't let anxiety take that away from you or your future students =\]"
