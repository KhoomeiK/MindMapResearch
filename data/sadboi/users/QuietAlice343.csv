You know, I enjoyed it, maybe because I wasn't looking through nostaliga glasses like the rest of the sub, or because I don't get much time to play, or because I thought the music was pretty neat. Maybe I just enjoyed it because I went into it with an open mind and I didn't think ""Well bungie how are you going to fuck this one up""

But hang on, Menagerie didn't have a cutscene applied to it (at least to my knowledge), and there's quite a few bits of loot here and there. But I see you looking through those nostalgia glasses.

Everything I described is possible, and is wayy more fun than running up and charging someone with a shoulder. I'm also of the impression that if the distance between you and a titan is at the point where they can charge you, you've failed as a life for that round. Every class plays different, there's aspects that hunters have that titans and warlocks do not. We can't nerf a class because of a shoulder charge because that takes away the uniqueness of that class. A warlock or a hunter doesn't have the shoulder mass to make a charge."

DestinyTheGame,f2emvgl,t1_f2eluy1,1570199440.0,"Yes. It's a knife. Not a shoulder/shield/hammer swing. A knife has precision and grace, a shoulder does not need precision and grace. You have 3 knives, explodey knives, good for shield draining, precision knives, good for when you're out of bullets but you still need a little bit of range, and ninja knives, where if you're good enough you never stop throwing them. I think if you're using the throwing knife (and only the throwing knife) to get kills you're using it wrong."
DestinyTheGame,f2emasp,t3_dd10z5,1570199036.0,"If you don't like the eververse stuff, then just don't buy the silver items. Wait for it to become bright dust purchase-able. Eververse is as fine as ever, with the main change being that next to 100% of the profit goes straight to bungie themselves. Now I dunno about you, but personally I think the Fortnite model is a bit shit, and preys heavily on FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) among its consumers. 

Pro tip. Putting ""Thanks for listening to my, or This has been my Ted talk"" doesn't really sell your post as a serious one. It kind of comes of that you're a bit of a memer or you're troll posting for fun."
