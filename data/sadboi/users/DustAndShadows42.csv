guineapigs,fq1v1w8,t3_ggg2as,1589049758.0,I would definitely take the guinea pig to the vet
guineapigs,fq1uwg1,t3_gggbnw,1589049690.0,"First off, make sure you are using Timothy hay. Alfalfa hay should only be fed if your piggies are under six months or pregnant. You can also give them oat hay, but it should be more of a treat than a major chunk of your guinea pigs diet.

My tips:
1. Mix some pellets in with their hay. That way while searching for their pellets, they'll get more used to the smell and taste of the hay, and will also be more inclined to eat it in order to find the pellets.
2. Change up the way you give them hay. Instead of just placing it in a hay rack, try stuffing it in a toilet paper roll or paper bag with holes in it. This could make the process more interesting for them.
3. Try to get hay that is long, thin, and green. This seems to be the type most guinea pigs like best.

When I first got my piggies, they had never eaten hay or pellets in their life. I gave them small quantities at the beginning, and now they're always wheeking if they're running low on hay. It takes time but your piggies will probably eat it eventually!"
guineapigs,fq1tsmg,t3_ggj3lj,1589049218.0,"That could be ringworm. If it is, you'll want to be extra careful because ringworm can spread to other piggies and even humans pretty fast. I'd suggest taking your piggie to the vet as soon as you can :)"
guineapigs,fq1tnd0,t3_ggkn6u,1589049151.0,I'm glad she's better!
guineapigs,fq0hcns,t3_gg6roo,1589031886.0,"It depends on your piggie. I don't think her being slightly dirty and smelly is something urgent, so if you're piggie isn't very comfortable with you or used to you yet, I'd suggest you wait another month or so and bond with her more. After she feels more comfortable around you, the bath will be easier to do. However, if your guinea pig is pretty trusting already, then I think it's alright to bathe her. 

When I bathe my guinea pig, I like to put her in a plastic tub instead of directly in the sink. That way it's more of a solid surface. I fill the tub with lukewarm water until it reaches her feet, and I rinse her off by using a cup and gently pouring water on her. Or you could use your hands for less pressure. I lather her with a small animal shampoo all over her body, except for her face. One thing I would recommend is having somebody nearby to help you, because most guinea pigs hate baths and will try to escape. It can be hard to get ahold of them when they're wet and slippery, so having someone else hold them while you shampoo them could help.

The bath takes only a few minutes, but I find that drying takes longer. You can wrap them in some towels and use a hairdryer on a low speed until they're dry- this could take anywhere from 30 minutes to a couple of hours. 

Good luck!"
guineapigs,fq0g2ja,t3_gg822f,1589031307.0,"Try to observe when she's biting the bars. For example, is she biting the bars when it's time for her veggies? Mine do this out of impatience. Or is she out of hay/water? 

If she's biting all the time, maybe think about upgrading her cage size? Also, does she have a friend? If not, I would recommend looking into getting another piggie. They're social creatures and need at least one other pig to live with them."
guineapigs,fq0f4xv,t3_ggez0l,1589030943.0,"One of mine does the same thing. She's always burrowing, but my other piggie never does it. What's helped me is using binder clips to pin the fleece to the cage bars, and then providing an extra blanket for the piggie to burrow in.

guineapigs,foxqvuk,t3_ga5c7t,1588153111.0,"First of all, it's okay. It's hard being a first-time guinea pig owner, and it's okay to make mistakes. In the future though, I'd recommend getting pigs from an adoption center if possible. Many times,the pet store employees do not know much about guinea pigs and they might end up misguiding you, such as what happened now.

Sometimes two piggies just don't get along, no matter what you try. Since it's only been a few days since you got the two of them, I think there's still a chance that they'll get along in the future. For now, since one of them seems to be seriously hurting the other and it's not stopping, I'd recommend getting them separate cages. Place the cages close together so that the two can still interact through the bars, but they can't hurt each other. Keep it like this for a while, and after some time, you can put them together under your supervision and see if they're getting along. If they are, slowly ease them into sharing a cage. And if not, keep them separated. 

I hope this helps! If you want more info, I'd recommend checking out some YouTube channels like Little Adventures and Saskia from LA guinea pig rescue. Good luck!"
