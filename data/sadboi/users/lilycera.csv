neuro,fkpcgdh,t1_fkpahwz,1584406832.0,Medication helps focus and meditation increases self-awareness to prevent hyperfocusing on the wrong thing/general distraction.
neuro,fkpahwz,t1_fkp12uy,1584405518.0,"I’ve recently been diagnosed with ADHD, but have been practicing mindfulness meditation for a while.  I’ve been reading about how it’s been suggested individuals with ADHD have increased default mode network (DMN) connectivity and I’ve also been reading how mindfulness meditation may lead to reduced DMN activity. Thought you might find interesting!"

depression,ffsasxy,t3_euni91,1580177307.0,"I’ve done this for a long long time.  I just can’t face waking up to the next day.  Unfortunately, it’s a vicious cycle as the day always comes and I just end up not being able to cope because of sleep deprivation so I dread everyday even more.  One thing I’ve found helpful is just putting on the same guided mediation video every night and because it’s familiar its even more soothing.  As for your parents and therapist... I didn’t talk to my parents for 2 years (although they recognised I had changed) and the only thing that upset them was that I hadn’t said sooner.  When I feel guilty for putting them through this or feel like a burden I just remind myself that they feel worse for me not saying.  I don’t know your situation so I apologise if they aren’t understanding of mental health etc as I understand it’s probably better not to talk to them if they aren’t supportive.   When I first started CBT it took me a long time to be really honest about what was going on inside my head, but it kinda became a process of sounding out these thoughts bit by bit.  As I became more honest my therapist only ever responded supportively, but also she never once made me feel “weird”.  For years I had thought that I was in this alone and I felt so ashamed and guilty, but the thing is so many people feel a similar way and although our experiences are all different ... we can all relate to this feeling.  I felt like my therapist might have freaked out, but she only ever thanked me for being honest with her... it occurred to me she’s probably heard a lot of it before and actually she is trained to deal with these feelings and thoughts I felt so ashamed for.   I don’t know if any of this is relevant to your situation at all so I’m sorry if not...  best best of luck and all my love."

depression,f6uuurl,t3_dt5r5o,1573169267.0,"Yep.  Had the best Summer and felt like I was finally getting things back together and a month or so ago I suddenly lost my motivation and now I feel like a different person again...  I’m just telling myself it’s due to the season and after a few months things will improve again, but it’s HARD."
depression,f36bn52,t3_dfsz9r,1570709887.0,I think about this all the time.  If I spend too long thinking about the world I come to the conclusion none of it is good and don’t belong here.  I don’t even necessarily have to be thinking of how horrible the world is ... just when I’m not distracted by something ?? It feels like I’m only truly happy when I’m in my own little bubble ... not thinking about anything apart from the housework I’m doing or the food I’m cooking.
