SebDerm,fpfdqnv,t3_gd3zxq,1588568282.0,Finding the right cleansing balance is one of the toughest parts of dealing with SD for me. Right now I'm doing head and shoulders once a week then alternating between a 'normal' sensitive skin shampoo (free and clear) and a piroctone olamine shampoo (sebamed) the rest of the week. I tried not shampooing on alternating days but my hair still gets crazy greasy and my facial skin suffers.
