The person who cornered you was within reason to ask clarifying questions, but shouldn't have become curt.

If he did make it his business to poll everyone else in attendance before talking to you, that just makes his actions even worse.

It hurts worse and worse as I go, feeling like torture, but reaches a threshold where it starts to get better.  I don't have the link, but I read it's a problem people who wear braids (like cornrows) get sometimes, because of decreased bloodflow from understimulation. I don't wear any styles like that, but it seems to be the same nerve issue, only my scalp nerves have a much different threshold for what understimulation is. I can't do any nice hairstyles because I have to take it all down and massage my scalp mid day. Brushing is torture with it because it pulls on the hairs while doing very little to help the scalp.

I only drink the green tea in the morning, before 12pm, so it doesn't interfere with sleep. The second thing is thinking very carefully about what you can delegate. If I can take some tasks off of my plate, I feel incredibly relieved. Asking for help is super hard, but being honest and reaching out for support can be a huge relief.  After discussing the situation with her, my  boss has a new policy that when other staff forget to do a particular task, instead of cleaning up their mess, I get to send it back to the original person for them to deal with. It saves me a ton of work. My husband also offered to do one of my normal chores until I feel better. I'm also moving right now, and when I've been honest with family about the current situation, they've been so helpful. I hope you have someone you can ask for help. I'm a Christian, so even if they're stretched too thin to help in person, if they can pray and send me uplifting Bible verses, it helps.
The only thing keeping me going at work is knowing that if I can get enough done this week, I can take a day off to rest soon without inconveniencing anyone. Every task I do will get me closer to that, so it's worth the struggle to do just one more thing.

juul,epulpvf,t3_bvqocx,1559511656.0,Do you leave them in your car?
juul,epp6g3u,t1_epp2ai6,1559365871.0,"Thank you! This is incredibly helpful. I very much appreciate your thorough response. Based on your advice, I'm thinking that using it as a structured reward system for completing tasks will be very effective. My previous system involved allowing myself to Google one thing that came into my head after the completion of a set amount of work. That lead me down rabbit holes and went abysmally. Now that I understand how to use it, Juul is becoming fantastic incentive."
juul,epntu4k,t1_epnh219,1559333233.0,"I agree, based on color associations, with green is go and red is stop. Tastes are a matter of opinion, so I'm not basing it on that."

DunderMifflin,epnsi5q,t3_bv9mf4,1559332563.0,I play this while folding laundry. Putting on the Office and drinking wine on their command is by far the best way to get my chores done.
