FinancialPlanning,fbchobj,t1_fbcekvr,1576724141.0,"FAFSA is just the name of the form. The financial aid package you receive will be made up of a combo of aid. You may get a Pell Grant (based on financial need and you don't have to pay it back), a subsidized loan (government pays interest until 6 months after you graduate but you have to pay back, usually you can pay it back under PAYE where it's a percentage of your income or you may be able to be forgiven if you go into certain non-profit jobs), unsubsidized loan (interest accumulates and you pay everything back-was 3-4% when I went to school but probably 6-7% now, I'm not sure). You can also get private loans which have high interest and you have to pay back. Your college may provide other options for loans/scholarships. Generally speaking, scholarships and grants are yours unless you fail or drop in which case you have to pay it back, loans you have to pay back. Be very careful with this debt but don't work yourself to death in school to avoid loans and end up failing classes. 

The community college then transferring is a great saver. I owe half as much due to this and my degree says FSU just like everyone else's. Usually doesn't matter which classes you take because a completed AA will almost always transfer. Also, go to your school's financial aid office and your program or college counselor/coordinator. They can help you find school specific grants and financial aid options. Keep on it and constantly check in to make sure you have the correct paperwork in and you're being processed. It's a pain but it's ultimately your responsibility and they usually don't care. Keep doing the FAFSA, promissory notes, etc. every year. And after college never forget to recertify your income for PAYE for your loans. Don't be afraid to call up your loan issuer and ask questions or ask for forbearance if needed too. 

Your high school should have guidance counselors that would be happy to help you get set and know about all kinds of aid. Florida for example has Bright Futures which is a grant for all Floridians and is easy to apply for. I didn't know about it through FAFSA since it's a different form, my h.s. counselor knew.
