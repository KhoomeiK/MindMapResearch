depression,fqji2jv,t3_gj2v91,1589410232.0,"I'm proud of you! College is not a race and people need to stop thinking about it that way. Tbh I kinda hate that it's called ""two year degree"" and ""four year degree."" The only reason I got my associates degree ""on time"" was because I got a headstart in high school. My bachelor's degree is going to take me an ""extra"" semester because I switched majors to something that I actually like, but also because I refused to let myself burn out with my course load. You got your degree and that's what matters!"

AmItheAsshole,fp6ndf3,t1_fp5lw5v,1588355311.0,"I had a kid with autism in high school sexually assault me in the middle of class and he played it off as ""I saw Shyla slap your butt so I thought I could too."" He had JUST observed me slapping my close male friend in the face because he smacked my butt too, so it should have been clear that I wasn't allowing guys to do that. (Keep in mind this was an athletic class and it's somewhat common for girls to pat each other on the butt for encouragement.) The teacher was mortified when he saw it, and didn't reprimand me for punching this dude. It was a long time coming.

This dude was a predator to so many girls. There was one girl that he would stalk to class at the community college, which was about a ten minute walk away from our high school. He would then wait outside her classroom for her and try to walk her home. He continued to follow her around for years. 

He later was tried and convicted as a rapist. Not sure what all happened there but what I heard is that he intimidated and coerced this girl."

LGBT+ people struggle enough with discrimination and stigmas. But let’s say they’re LGBT+ AND a sex worker (including but not limited to stripping, webcamming, porn, escorting, sugaring etc). I do think it’s a little odd that he won’t talk about himself to you, but it’s clear that you hold no malice against him. You were asked your opinion and you said it."

She ended up keeping them for herself; no biggie. After I weighed in at 120 that’s when she started buying me xs button downs and my arms were too muscular to fit. She’d also get me xs leggings from Asian online stores, even though I’d always worn a small and Asian sizes run even smaller.
TL;DR Yes she’s doing it on purpose"
