TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fom6c14,t1_foj363q,1587879589.0,"I personally don’t do that. I’ve never done that and I’ve been sexually assaulted numerous times. For most sexual assault victims, anything related to sexual objectification or violence is triggering so we seek to avoid it. Most women are sexual assault victims. All of my friends also do not watch porn. I have known a few girls who do- but they are the far and few. Porn hub also releases stats every year. Not that many women watch porn. And if they do, it’s usually other categories such as lesbian porn, massage porn, couples porn, and sometimes bdsm. But rape is not in the top categories for women list. Yes, I do think it is false. There may be some women who watch it as a side effect of trauma. And keep in mind, women can also be sexual predators even though it is less common. So yes, there may be some predator women who watch it. But overall, i believe those fake stats (with no backup- just what some person is saying) do not correlate with reality.  It was probably created by that person to create a buffer so porn sites won’t have to admit there’s a problem with violent and oppressive porn. Do you believe everything you read on the internet? Have you never heard of fake news? Have you ever read a Wikipedia page? There’s a reason why in scholar essays people are not allowed to use one person’s opinion or any journalist outlets. Hell, take TMZ as an example. They are constantly putting fake news about celebrities out there to damage their images. Here is another possibility: Have I ever searched for rape porn? Yes because I was afraid my rape may have been posted online. But I’ve never clicked on a video. It’s possible that women have searched for it out of fear of finding themselves online. But that doesn’t mean they actually watched any of the videos."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,foiyvjj,t1_foihq1w,1587801827.0,"I was raped a few months ago. My boyfriend told me that he was sickened by the idea of watching it after what happened to me. I asked him not to watch it for a while. Then two weeks later he watched it again and lied about it. Typical addict behavior. A lot of guys are on the defensive because they have become addicted. Addicts suck at admitting to their addictions, and trying to overcome them is an even bigger issue."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,foiy1xv,t1_fofmoo8,1587800964.0,"I think it’s funny bc those kind of feminists say they want women’s equality but they pull this shit. Historically, feminists have strived to free women from sexual oppression and only being viewed as breeders/sex objects. How is mass producing porn going to make the men think we are not just breeders? How is shoving naked women in their face everyday going to convince them we are human and more than something to fuck/impregnate? Feminists have tried to take down arranged marriages in other countries that exchange women for money. Why are these women being exchanged? Because their “suitors” want sex/children. Nothing more. Feminists tell women that they can be more than breeders. Then these fake feminists come along and flaunt their bodies online and make sex their sole purpose in life. They are not for women’s equality. They are tearing apart everything feminism has worked for. Tbh, I don’t think that those kind of women should even be called feminists. They’re more like female simps. They’re only degenerating the world’s view of themselves and their own gender."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,foixlat,t3_g7617r,1587800480.0,"They’re porn sick. They’re used to going online and seeing women’s bodies being shown off for their pleasure and rated. That’s how videos are rated on porn websites. They do the same thing on social media. They think it’s okay to have double standards of women because that’s how they’re raised in this society. To them women are not human. (There have been actual studies done about this. If a guy regularly watches porn and they see a woman showing any bit of skin (boobs, butt, stomach), the part of their brain that registers another human gets turned off. Look it up.) If they saw a woman rating guys like that, they would feel sickened. They’d say it’s unfair and immature. But they don’t care about doing it to females. Because to them, females are less than human. To them females are simply sex objects."

rape,fodw9p0,t1_focbl34,1587691327.0,That friend sounds toxic and he’s most likely also violated girls. Only rapists defend rapists. Your gut feels uneasy for a reason. Would anyone who wasn’t a pedophile defend pedophilia? It’s a sex crime. That’s not something you defend. You don’t defend things unless you agree with them. Especially when it comes to your friend getting sexually abused. I’d cut both of them out of your lives.
rape,fo9ypa6,t3_g6jaru,1587635141.0,"Yes it’s rape. No Bob does not care about Ally. Sex is an extremely personal thing. If instinct was an excuse for rape then every rapist would be excused. If Bob can follow normal social rules, and even if Bob had a severe learning disorder, Bob should’ve known that was rape. Ally needs to stop making excuses for Bob. He knew he hurt her. He only stopped afterward when he was done and Ally started fighting back. Bob is a manipulator. Everyone does things intentionally. Especially rape. Putting your penis in someone is not something that happens unintentionally. My ex did this. I was in denial for a long time. Love is blind. Staying will only hurt you more. I wish I had the courage to report because my ex Bob has hurt so many more people since. He left me once he was done using me. He also told his friends very nasty things about me and made me never want to go back to that school. Ally is right that Bob can not be trusted. I hope you find courage. The first step is getting a rape kit. You can choose to use it or do nothing with it. But at least they’ll have it. They keep it for many years. And you can do it anonymously. But you can’t take a shower before you get it done because it might affect the DNA in the kit. If you did take a shower, it’s still worth it to get it done."

NoStupidQuestions,flc43f4,t1_fb0wtni,1585019389.0,"Coercion is also rape. If you asked her multiple times and kept pushing despite her saying no or anything other then yes, it’s still rape. If you did anything that seemed threatening (coming onto her after being told no) and she seemingly agreed out of fear it is rape. Or If she asked to stop mid way and you continued it is rape. It also depends on how drunk she is. Incapacitation is also defined as not being able to walk. At that point, she’ll barely be able to talk and she won’t remember anything the next day. That is rape. Lastly, if she thought you were someone else it is rape."
rape,ffsvtti,t1_ffsaeyg,1580194501.0,"I agree but I also know that after that event you’re in a constant mode of fear. It’s good to know that you have options and those options don’t have to inflict further fear. If I wasn’t supported by others around me to get a kit, I would’ve just cried in bed for weeks and been depressed. Now I feel like I have the potential to actually do something about it. She may have the misconception that if she gets a kit she’ll have to speak with law enforcement. Tell her she can find a sexual assault clinic to do it anonymously at. All I’m saying is, she needs her options made more clear to her and she needs support so she can have options in the future."
rape,ffs7zk7,t1_ffs7vk4,1580175384.0,If she needs a couple of weeks or months to report it that’s fine. But she really does need to get a kit done. Let her know that she doesn’t have to report if she gets a kit. The kit only provides her with the option to report it in the future if she wants to.
rape,ffrnebz,t1_ffrmisw,1580161651.0,"Yes you can still report it. If she ever decides to report it, they’ll contact the neighbors anyway. If she takes too long because she’s too attached to this guy, neighbors may move away and they may lose your evidence. I’d call now. Also tell them that you’re worried what may happen to her if they knock on their door (so they don’t do that). They might come ask to speak with her, but if you tell them that they’ll be more careful about not letting bf know what it’s about. It’s always helpful in a domestic violence situation to know that you’re not alone and have evidence from someone else as well. You can also ask to remain anonymous so bf can’t come knocking on your door. If he does you can just look at him like he’s crazy and say “idk what you’re talking about man.” Apartments have a million connected walls so it could be anyone. Don’t be afraid of being targeted.

There’s a chance that if she reports it the other girls may come forward as well. Let her know that because it would be his first time getting in trouble with the police that he would only be doing community service and parole. If he fucks up the parole by raping someone else, then he’ll go to jail. But if he’s on parole it will prevent him from doing that to other girls. A lot of girls are scared that they’ll be shit on if they put someone in jail. Assure her that won’t happen and there are also other ways to settle it. She needs to get a rape kit done ASAP. You can’t wait more than a few days. Also please get new friends. Those are really shitty people. Do not let it go."

You shouldn’t have to deal with being in their presence ever again. They premeditated a sexual assault. And there were multiple of them. That is a huge violation. The best thing you can do is tell your parents so you can get the support you need. This is something that can really mess with your growth as a person and you need someone to talk to.

When I was 15 my ex sexually assaulted me. He had also been extremely violent and kept shoving me into lockers at school. If my parents hadn’t gotten involved, I don’t know where I’d be. So please speak up. That’s the best thing you can do to take back control in your life and get the help you need.

I know what it’s like to feel confused when your friends hurt you. I know what it’s like to feel scared to say something. And I know how loneliness can creep up on you when this sort of thing happens. But you need to find new friends. You can’t allow these sort of people back into your life only to violate you again.

The only thing he respected was not choking me. I don’t know why because he wasn’t respecting anything else anyway.

His friends even eventually admitted they knew I had told him stop because apparently I was being super loud. But they didn’t care. They voiced it as me having “second thoughts.” They knew I never wanted it to begin with"

seduction,fcyc4wt,t1_eyty17e,1578077848.0,"Rape is also defined by being mentally incapacitated. If there was penetration and she was that drunk then yes. What is mental incapacitation? Being drunk or on substances. Especially if she said no at any point. Because when you’re that drunk, you can’t exactly just walk away or punch a mans in the face. Y’all really don’t know the definition of rape, do you? This is why many people are given substances before a rape occurs. So they won’t be able to physically fight back"

I was also relatively new to a friend group when one of them sexually assaulted me. To me it seemed things would be easier if I kept myself in denial by still being friends with them. The best thing you can do is make it clear to her that they are not her friends. You both need to stop being around them and stop talking to them. Not only so this doesn’t happen again, but also for her mental health. It doesn’t matter how many drugs he was on. He knew better. I’d also suggest taking her to a clinic to get some rape kit testing done before she takes a shower. Whatever she wants to do with the information she can decide later. But at least she’ll have the choice to decide"
rape,fcy73h5,t3_ej8knc,1578075766.0,"I personally don’t understand how a rape fantasy could be rape. Sex isn’t rape if you want it to happen/it’s consensual. Rape is rape because it’s nonconsensual/you don’t want it to happen. And it’s pretty easy to tell the difference. One leaves your mind and life in shambles and on the edge of a breakdown every 5 minutes. The other is something you enjoy.


I read this story on a different sub that talked about how this one girl had a rape fantasy so she asked a tinder date to rape her after dinner. It’s not rape if you want it to happen. It makes 0 sense.


As for the being friends part, I can understand it to a degree. I was friends with my rapist before it happened. I didn’t have many red flags that would happen. I knew he was a total player, but I never thought he was like that. He seemed like a nice friend before that night. In my head it was extremely confusing putting 2 and 2 together. Because again, he seemed like a nice guy. Until I got drunk, I didn’t see many red flags. I kept trying to tell myself that it was all a mistake and misunderstanding of communication because he was drunk too. But stop means stop. No means no. And he knew better. If it hadn’t been pried out of me the day after, I might still be friends with him and his friends. Because denial is easier sometimes. And being left in a confused state of mind is really difficult to deal with.

It’s especially difficult to deal with when that person is someone you really love. When I was 15 I was raped by my ex boyfriend. He had severe anger issues and after a while his mom made him stop seeing me because he kept shoving me into lockers at school and screaming at me on the phone. He sexually assaulted me one day. I went home and cried about it on the phone to my best friend. Then I continued to see him and do whatever he wanted as a way of denial. To convince myself I had wanted that so I didn’t have to accept that the person I loved definitely did not love me. It’s one of the hardest things someone can go through. So I don’t blame anyone for being in denial. It’s difficult to see your way out when they’ve been gaslighting and manipulating you for so long. When you are that deeply in love it’s the worst thing in the world to accept that they don’t love you. And what’s even more, that they care so little about you that they’re abusing you."

rape,fckua85,t3_ehlc0p,1577733332.0,"I went through something similar with my ex. I think it’s a way of being in denial. He raped me a couple years ago. He had also physically assaulted me a number of times. After my ex raped me I couldn’t stand the feeling of being a victim or thinking badly of him. I couldn’t stand the pain. So I kept doing sexual things with him afterward in attempt to make myself think I was just “that kind of girl.” That’s been my response right after every time I’ve been sexually assaulted. It didn’t happen after my most recent assault because I didn’t let it. But my immediate thought was that maybe if I did it again I wouldn’t feel so shitty. Maybe if I did it again it would make it consensual. It’s not true and it doesn’t work, if anything it makes things worse: but pretending to be the person my rapist wanted me to be seemed easier in the moment. I’m not sex shaming in any way by saying “that kind of girl.” What I mean is my rapist’s kind of girl. The girl my rapist wanted me to be. I had a lot of consensual sex with my bf before my most recent sexual assault happened. So again, in no way am I sex shaming. What I’m saying is that pretending to be the person they wanted me to be sometimes seemed like an easier option so i didn’t have to accept the reality of who I am. My values, my self respect, my consent. It was a facade that made me think maybe if I pretended to want it and pretended those were my choices, I had control and their respect. Like we could live in a fairy tale happily ever after. Where nothing was bad and no one was a danger to me or wanted to hurt me- even though I already had been hurt. And I hoped I wouldn’t feel the pain anymore. Maybe you felt similar. I don’t know. I can’t tell you why you did it. But I know why I did."

I knew telling him no would do nothing. I had tried doing that already multiple times and he just climbed on top of me. There was no way out of the situation. I couldn’t walk or really stand up at all. Everyone else there was instigating it or blacked out. Acting like it was no big deal was my way of being in denial at first. Going along with it was my way of keeping myself as safe as I could in that moment. Think about it like this: when someone holds a gun to your head and tells you to give them money, what do you do? You give them money without much of a word. You do whatever they say. Why? Because you know they’re in a place of power and nothing you could do or say will change that.

I was physically abused by my parents growing up. I learned to stop fighting back eventually because I knew things could get a lot worse. So I’d go along with it until he left. When I was raped, I was drunk for the first time ever on some very hard liquor. I should have been in the ER for alcohol poisoning. Somehow my body handled it well. But I was very far gone. And I was drugged. I told him verbally no and stop multiple times before and during. At one point my instincts took over to let him do whatever he wanted. And to say whatever he wanted me to. I believe it was because I instinctively knew trying to make it stop would do nothing. And it could’ve actually just gotten me more hurt."
rape,fcad214,t3_egp834,1577567083.0,"Step 1: End things with your boyfriend. If he can’t back you up and is causing more damage to your mental health, leave him. He’s no good to you.

Step 2: If it’s not too late, get a rape kit and do drug testing. File a report

Step 3: Find someone to talk to. A friend, a counselor. 

Step 4: Figure out where you want to go from step 2."
rape,fcacrii,t3_egplqg,1577566904.0,Sounds like he’s trying to lure you back in. End that shit yourself. Don’t wait for him to block you. Block him
rape,fcacgtf,t1_fca2x4b,1577566731.0,You can’t give consent when drunk. You can’t give consent when on drugs. Did you feel coerced or did you actually want it? That’s the real question.
rape,fcac309,t1_fcabzk1,1577566511.0,I’m glad. I hope you find it.
rape,fc9pek4,t3_egptm1,1577556174.0,Yes. It’s normal.
rape,fc9p7rk,t3_egqji6,1577556080.0,"I had a similar situation two weeks ago. My boyfriend had just broken up with me after completely violating my trust. I wanted to get drunk or high to forget everything for at least a few hours. I didn’t know how it would end or what state of mind I’d be in because I had never been drunk before. I just heard that it helped people get over things for a short period of time. And I just wanted to feel happy even for a few minutes or hours. I told my friends this and they came to pick me up and bring me back to one of their apartments. I ended up getting drunk and one of them started hitting on me. I flirted back but I told him I didn’t want to do anything else but talk and have his arm around me. I was stumbling all over the place and it’s taken me weeks to remember most things. The friend offered his bedroom and the guy took me in there knowing full well that I didn’t want to have sex. But for me, I was so drunk that this bedroom didn’t ring any alarms for me. I was just like “oh you want to talk alone! That sounds sweet:)))”. I kept telling him no before and during. They claim that because I went along with it because I was so drunk, I must have wanted it. Regardless of whether or not you said yes, as you stated already- you were so drunk you barely remember anything. That is not a place that you are capable of giving consent. I guarantee the guy knew and is just taking advantage of you more by gaslighting you. Don’t tolerate it. Get angry and take your life back."
rape,fc9o3au,t3_egqji6,1577555599.0,Consent can’t be given when drunk unless it was given beforehand
rape,fc9mch1,t3_egt3wl,1577554829.0,"A man who truly cares about you will always have faith in you no matter how difficult it is. If he loved you as much as you do, he’d be fighting for you. This is one of the hardest dilemmas in life. Loving someone more than they love you. Your happiness will be found better elsewhere. This situation is only putting you in agony. I know the feeling of wanting someone who’s your first to stay your first. I lost my virginity to my bf and I wanted things to stay just between us forever. Which is part of what makes the situation so hurtful... That I couldn’t control that. It feels like the closest thing I have to a happy ever after was taken away a lot of days, too. But you deserve to be surrounded by people who are healthy. And who will fight for you. You have a lot of trauma to work through. Despite what you think, he may be a lot worse than you realize. Love often puts blinders on. He could be fueling it. Or he’s just incredibly selfish. Both are not great.

They can’t take your happiness away if you don’t let them. But what you’re in right now isn’t happiness. You need to find happiness elsewhere."
rape,fc9krjq,t1_fc7gr24,1577554124.0,"I know you’re trying to help but at this point hearing “it will get better” honestly just makes me so angry. I’ve had abusive parents my entire life and gone through some even more really fucked up shit. What angers me about this time is that right as I was trying to hold out hope things would get better, this happened. Things don’t get better. They just hurt less with time until the next thing happens. But they never really go away."
rape,fbw5hfh,t1_fbvqjeb,1577141418.0,"They keep claiming that I was into it and it was my fault. That it was a mutual thing between him and I. Even though they knew how drunk I was, that we had just broken up, and I said I only wanted to talk and cuddle. Everyone else who was there has been sticking up for their side of the story. Sometimes I feel so crazy like maybe I just forgot everything and maybe it really is my fault. And maybe a drink got spiked with drugs and no one knew. Because when you’re drunk your pupils constrict. He had plenty of alcohol and his pupils looked like he was on drugs. They never really treated me badly in the past and that’s what has been messing with my head so much. The day they started harassing me they were freaking out saying they wouldn’t stand for their friend to be accused of being a rapist. (A was the one who kept talking to me, J didn’t care much). Even though I had told them multiple times I wasn’t blaming anyone. But because my BF was, they got extremely defensive. They claimed that I came into him and that was my intention from the very beginning of the night. But until I started getting drunk, I didn’t flirt back with J."
rapecounseling,fbtnhqc,t3_eco556,1577086165.0,I’m just glad he’s possibly getting impeached. It’s also been a trigger for me for the same reasons.
sex,fau39s8,t1_fattogv,1576343944.0,I told him no the first time. That those weren’t my intentions. He asked me if I was okay with sex or making out and I told him I just wanted to cuddle and talk. That should’ve been enough. I also don’t believe that consent can be given when you’re too drunk to stand up straight. Then I got even more drunk. And I kept saying stop during it happening at certain points. But it kept going. And yes there were times when I got into it but I also kept saying stop at different times. So it wasn’t even total consent. It should’ve stopped. Maybe I wasn’t clear about why I wanted to stop and he just thought it was because we hadn’t finished and it had been hours. But I was drunk. And communication is shit when you’re drunk. I don’t blame him because he was also drunk off his ass. I don’t think his intention was to disrespect me in any way. And he wanted to respect my wishes at first. But he didn’t because of his friends. I know my friends didn’t have that intention for me and just wanted to help me get over my ex. And I’m not going to yell rape. He’s a good dude. He was just also drunk off his ass. But in truth I would have never made that decision sober.
