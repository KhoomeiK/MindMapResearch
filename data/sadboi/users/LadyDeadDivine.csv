I try my best as just a member to reply to as much individuals as I could and it scares me to see how much posts go unnoticed. Like do these moderators realize how much suicidal people come here to write their last goodbye? I know people post here most of the time and don’t do it but like YOU never know and it’s scary and sad... it’s kinda messed up to think about the reality depths of this community."
relationship_advice,ewx6r6q,t1_ewx6jcq,1565846444.0,"Well did you read that? She bluntly called him unattractive, like honest but rude. Many individuals take it differently. I’m just putting out there what I think he should do because he seems like a sweet sensitive guy, and she seems blunt. Plus it’s ldr, she could be liking other guys photos and he’s just innocent."
relationship_advice,ewx616w,t3_cqlel4,1565845653.0,"Young people want to do stupid things, and you do have the right to be furious because she’s your girlfriend. I think her decision is completely stupid definitely with the fact many woman have been going missing in Canada lately. So if she doesn’t show up , you do have the right calling the police without sounding crazy."
relationship_advice,ewx5tf3,t3_cqle1i,1565845421.0,"Man, coming from a girl, she should be more nice about it, LDR or not. Calling your partner unattractive is blunt but also rude because it’s your partner. I’d say give her the cold shoulder so she can realize how much this hurts you. 
But if you really do love her, tell her it bothers you, don’t let it just slide by. Being with someone is all about honesty. I hope you feel better."
