Honestly...it‚Äôs dumb but I‚Äôve found myself looking at stupid posts on tiktok or Instagram to help chill myself out. I‚Äôve got anxiety and tachycardia and can drown in fear in 2 seconds but these things have really pulled me out of it the past couple weeks. 

If you play video games, play them now. Watch your old favorite tv shows! Read a book, even if you‚Äôve read it 15 times already. Color? Clean your dirty af car

It‚Äôs not the best advice, but I‚Äôm finding distracting myself is the only way to help right now

A big part of the reason I also don‚Äôt want to call the cops is because you‚Äôre right, it could be medicinal and I know how helpful it is.
