No, we don't have any expectations at all, but have taken vacations where we were in a different place every night and felt like we never got to see any of the cities we slept in. In those cases, we were driving from city to city across southern Spain, and we're planning to use trains exclusively on this trip, but we just don't really know the area and are interested in what an appropriate expectation is for train travel after landing in Vienna.

We've seen how day-trips can get you to most of the cities in Austria, and overnight trains from Vienna can get you as far as Paris or London (IIRC).

We aren't looking to pack a lot into this trip, but not being familiar with Austrian cities, we're wondering if a Night Train to Venice would be appropriate, or if we'd regret not going slower and spending more time in smaller Austrian cities."

I spent far more time hand-degassing and researching the best way to degass than I should have. Once you have a small electric vacuum pump, you'll stop searching for what is the best way to degass because it will be obvious that it is working and the taste difference is very obvious.

If you aren't mechanically inclined, it might be a bit of a stretch to put together all the parts, but it works instantly and produces amazing results.

https://imgur.com/a/5zucYFe

EDIT: just to clarify why you would want to degass and why you might consider doing it:

If you've ever left a bottle of wine open overnight or even capped a half-drunk bottle of wine overnight, you've probably come back the next day and found that terrible taste. Oxygen has been exposed to the wine and like any fruit left out, it smells and tastes terrible.

I've found this to be true with wines as well. It isn't the ""air"" in the carboy you're pulling out, because as you can see in the video, there isn't much room left in the carboy. The vacuum pump pulls the oxygen out of the wine. You'll think there is none in there, then you'll turn on the vacuum pump and bubbles will start appearing out of nowhere and will keep bubbling as long as the pump is connected. 

I regularly degass my wines early on so that I remove as much of the oxygen as I can and the end result is a wine that doesn't have a sour, off-putting odor to it. Once you've degassed them fully, not many bubbles will come out later on."
