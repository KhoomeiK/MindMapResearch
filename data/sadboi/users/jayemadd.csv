The negative Libras that I know will do this to the point where it becomes gossipy and passive aggressive, which is toxic. 

As for Capricorns, my dad was a Capricorn, but while he was motivated by his work, the only reason he stayed with his jobs is because they made him look more important then he really was. Now that I think back, a lot of his life choices were motivated by his jobs, and how important they made him feel. He definitely was not emotionless though, my dad was a huge prankster, and he had a swarm of friends. He was a Leo moon, and I believe a Leo rising so that probably has something to do with it.

Honestly, it's probably not the best time to be in a relationship, especially with somebody who is not stable.

Yeah, I don't think I'm truly unique.

I feel trying to be unique is quite dead, and has been dead for many centuries, but it is beautifully poetic, yeah? 

The more people I have met in my lifetime, which is quite a bit in my line of work, the more I realize that my life is far from special or original. Sure, lots of people have experiences that are more conventional than mine, there are also millions people have experiences that I could not even fathom. 

This isn't a depressing thought. This is actually just kind of realizing we're just humans, and realizing that we're not really that special, and that's absolutely okay. Kind of takes the pressure off, and I welcome that.

My brain never stops, and I've had bouts of insomnia for years. I feel everything. Sometimes it feels like I'm absorbing other's pain, but I know that's very unhealthy and my logical side tries to kick in and knock it off. It doesn't always work, and I fall victim to many narcissistic relationships. I just have this overwhelming need to want to heal and save every single person I let into my very heavily guarded inner world. Those not in my inner world I still care about, but don't get that same intense treatment. I'm also heavily prone to escapism and (unfortunately, though this could be genetic) addiction. I also play devil's advocate often, and try to see personal situation from a third party's perspective. Doesn't always work, but I try."

As far as my feelings now though, I have felt better about myself and my physical appearance over the course of the past few days and weeks. I've been eating better, not using, going for lots of late night bike rides around the city and seeing Chicago look like a quiet apocalypse. My hair's getting really long and healthy from not styling it constantly, and my skin is glowing from keeping up with a healthy routine and not having to cake on make-up everyday. I'm creating art constantly, and falling back in love with myself.

I'm sure there were plenty of security cameras *inside* the actual tower that captured a whole lot of chaos, but we will never see that.

Also, my full-time job is very social and conversational (bartending), so knowing a lot of random information is always good to have. Other people like hearing about themselves, so if you know off the top of your head what zodiac sign they are and can roast them about it while they're enjoying a beer, they usually adore that. As far as numerology, colors, symbolism, anything like that? No. I do practice candle magic and other forms of hoodoo, but I feel that's more just my form of manifestation."
tarot,fq2miip,t1_fq20th9,1589057565.0,"Honestly, just consistent practice. When I say journaling, I really mean journaling. I mean writing down the question that I asked or that someone asked me, and writing down the cards, and writing down how I interpreted them. And then if a specific event happened, I would go back and write about what actually happened, and reflecting on the card and what it could possibly mean or what it did mean. I don't know if I said this in my original message, but I've also been reading cards since 2007, so it is definitely not a skill you learn quickly. 

I don't put a lot of heaviness on my cards, and I don't treat them like they are sacred text. I think they are just tools to let us tap into a skill set we already have. The pictures and the spreads are just a way for us to concretely channel messages. That being said, I don't even use any traditional spreads. I usually just pull three cards for a single question, with each card kind of building up on each other to form a clearer picture. 

Anyways, to get to predictive reading, like I said I would just practice practice practice. Keep reading for yourself and keep track of every question you ask. Pull a card for everyday, and then at the end of your day see if it matched up with that card. Every time you meet a new person that will seem to be a somewhat consistent figure in your life, pull a card to ask about their personality and what they will mean in your life, and then a few months to a year later, see if those cards match up. I've done that several times and have gotten pretty on-point results. I'm sure your friends and people online would like readings, so volunteer to give readings for feedback. That was one way I got good practice, was readings for feedback on online forums. Makes me super sad that Aeclectic is not operating anymore, but if you search card combinations you'll still find the backlog, and that forum was so super helpful. Anyways, everything takes time. Best of luck!"

Funny story, because I actually worked that day at 6AM, and was so tired I was originally not even going to go out that night, but my friend coaxed me into it. I didn't talk to him much of the party, but he was a friend of my best friend's friend's then-boyfriend. The first thing I ever said to him was ""You know who you look like?! Joaquin Phoenix!"" And he did. He looked like Joaquin Phoenix in ""The Gladiator"". Greenest eyes I ever saw.

We started talking to each other a little bit, then I guess he asked our mutual contact for my phone number. We saw a movie together, and before we parted ways, he asked when I would be free next. We met up for coffee and had a few more ""dates"" before we hung out for a final time a few months later, and he confessed that he really liked me and he was wondering if we could see each other steadily. I (in a very sassy way--he teased me about it for years) asked him why the hell he hadn't kissed me yet. We were 22/23."

This full moon and the lead up, I've felt very... detoxed? My Venus is also in Scorpio, and the Venus RX is going to be affecting my 9th house. I'm finally feeling the chains of my own issues holding me backing being lifted.

At the beginning of the year, I already made a mini promise to myself to date with purpose this year, so that was already a goal. This pandemic kinda squashed that, but I realized it was for the better because I am not entirely ready to date seriously. I was still battling (still am, I mean, I always will be) an addiction at the dawn of 2020, and was only 60 days sober. I ended up relapsing when this shit hit my industry (bartending) hard and shut our jobs down indefinitely. I've been clean for 27 days, but it was a rough wake up call that I am in no state for a serious relationship for a few more months. 

That aside, the past few days I've been examining the people in my life, current and past, and why I hung on to certain relationships like they were lifeboats. I think back, and while it was interesting that I met those individuals, they didn't contribute to any *future* happiness, just present feelings. I don't want that in a person in my life anymore. I want people who want to see things--and me--happy in the future, and vice versa. If I ever meet a person again who says ""Let's just live in the moment"", nah dude. You see zero future with me. Bye."
My600lbLife,fpq7i62,t1_fpq6e1q,1588816721.0,"I haven't seen this episode, but here's my time to shine! /s

Ultimatums only work on addicts when you take away the absolute things they need most. If you supply their house, you take away housing. If you are supplying them financially, you immediately cut off all contact and financial support. It will only work if it is a direct result for them to hit rock bottom. If it does not result in that, then no, an ultimatum will never work on any addict: food, alcohol, or illegal drugs. This is how an intervention process usually works, and why they tend to be successful ONLY IF the people involved stand their ground and keep their bottom lines.

ChildrenofDeadParents,fpc2pea,t3_gb8tlg,1588485699.0,"I lost my dad when I was 11 to an armed robbery. He was not the robber, but he was the hapless victim.

Positives (if you can call them that): I am very independent. The people who I have in my life, I cherish every moment with them because I will never know when they will leave my world. I cherish every moment I get to spend with my mom, and I make sure to let her know how much I truly love her appreciate her. When it comes to romantic relationships, I try not to ever fight about the small things; life is just way too short and I would much rather spend my time laughing and loving my partner then fighting with them over who did the dishes last. 

Negatives: I definitely have abandonment issues, especially when it comes to romantic partners. When a partner breaks up with me, I often flip the fuck out because it just brings back that feeling of my dad leaving me. Set lost control, resulting in pain and confusion. I've also noted that when I am in a relationship with a man, I do tend to lean on them as my savior and protector. I have a strong outer shell, but deep down inside I am a very vulnerable girl who just really wants love. Another negative is, I am absolutely terrified for when my mom passes away.

As time progresses, you will have your moments where it seems so fucking unfair, intolerable, and heavy. ""Being strong"" is a mindset our culture needs to ditch

FemaleDatingStrategy,fpbxe8z,t3_gc4zwj,1588481247.0,"I did. Glimpses. While he and I were both in therapy--seperately working on our own issues--and together. He was keeping up with his medications (Bipolar type 1), and I was working through my issues surrounding myself, body image, etc. I was in school, working, and we were building a screen printing business together. The foundation of our relationship is that we actually got along really well as friends before we even dated. Just clicked, read each other's minds. Conversations flowed. We understood each other's chaos. I think that's what still glued us together long after the love died. 

But, I was very unhappy in our first apartment and pushed for us to move to a different one. Repeatedly I asked if he was on board, telling him if he wasn't that I would back off and just redecorate or something. He said he was okay with moving. 

The minute we moved, EVERYTHING was a fucking disaster. Everything was my fault. The radiators would break: my fault. Hot water heater broke: my fault. We had a fucking polar vortex one year: my fault. Don't get me wrong, that apartment ended up being a unique hell, but it was moreso the town and not the actual property. I was just as unhappy as he was, but unlike him, I wasn't blaming someone for things that couldn't be controlled. We'd have endless fights on why we moved, or ""Why *I* forced *him* to move"" and I felt like I was on trial pleading my case that I asked him several times to TELL ME if he didn't want to. I know I can become obsessed with a new idea and carried away, but just bring me back to earth and I'll chill. 

So, the love and feeling like a team just slowly rotted away over the 3 years we lived in that apartment together. It got to the point where we didn't even say ""I love you"" or kiss each other goodbye. The straw that broke the camel's back for me is when his good female friend, who had hated me since day one for absolutely no reason, told him point blank that she did not want me to be present at the birthday party she was having.... at the bar I worked at. He told me, I calmly said, ""Okay, cool. I get off at 10 anyway."" The entire night his whole Snapchat story was filled with them all celebrating, taking shots, playing pool, etc. 

At that point I was 99.9% checked out. A few days after that night, we were just talking in the kitchen, and I asked him why he didn't even defend me against *blank* when she blatantly disrespected me? I have never done a thing to disrespect this woman, but he did warn me when we started dating that she had been ""in love"" with him since high school (don't they all seem to have stories like that?). I told him I was hurt by it, that it's a low blow, but it's done and over with. I just wanted to know why he didn't even say anything. 

Well, he blew the FUCK up. Got centimeters away from my face screaming that how DARE I should even question something like that. Fuck me for even DOUBTING his love and honor for me. I should be GRATEFUL to have a man like him at my side. 

Done.

The rest of the story doesn't end so hot. Physical fight. Cooling off period. I saw it as a sign we were absolutely incompatable. He saw it as our ""rock bottom"" and we could only go up from there. The break up was... bad. An old crush from my past entered my life and I strayed. That lasted about as long as oxytocin does (<2 years). 

In the end, years later, I did find out he had stopped going to therapy and stopped taking his medication around the time we moved into the new place. I should've suspected, because he was deathly afraid of needles and I usually had to go with him for blood draws to test his lithium levels. Oh well."

My dad was a great father *to me*, but not a great husband, and his relationship with my brother was heavily strained. Decades since his death, I've been able to see him as a fallible human being.

My unique twist is, my dad did not choose to abandon me: he was killed during an armed robbery. I was very close with my dad, and his death and accompanying murder trial were by far the most traumatizing things in my life. I always had addictive tendencies, and often did little things to the extreme, but I never thought that I would develope substance abuse issues. I always considered myself ""above"" that, which is really stupid. Slowly, everytime a romantic relationship failed I noticed I would adopt a new ""habit"", until one big heartbreak just drove me over the edge and I entered a really depressive stage in life, and started using everyday, several times a day. Days off were party days. Anything to fill a void and feel ""love"", even if it was fake love. 

So, basically, when someone leaves me and I can't control and understand why they are leaving me, no matter how loving and affectionate of a partner I *think* I'm being (I'm sure, borderline smothering sometimes), I freak the fuck out because it's triggering that feeling of my dad leaving me all. fucking. over. again.

Not ""war stories"", but just that really gnarly stuff that I think back to in a sober mindset and am ashamed of. 

Mostly, I think about the fact that towards the end of my daily usage I wasn't even using to get high, I was using to numb myself and get un-sick. It wasn't fun; nothing was fun. It just became medicine--like a fucking Tylenol--at that point."

Why not?

I feel you. I relapsed, too. All we can do is recognize what we did and start back again. Think of more and more things you can fill your day with that aren't addiction related and push yourself to do them. Go to sleep, and repeat. Things will get better, but it takes some struggle."
