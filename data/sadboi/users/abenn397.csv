Catan,fqjl53s,t1_fqhw02o,1589411501.0,My husband and I are THAT couple who teeters on the line between domestic violence and divorce during Settlers of Catan and Catan Universe. It's hilarious for the other players because we use Voice Chat through Discord.

They love it because it feels good, and afterwards, they smell baby fresh!"

Unfortunately, they were both taken from this world immediately by a White Acura. Strangers stopped and took him to the PetCare a few blocks away, but he was gone on impact. He was our sweet, loving, protective, 100% ALPHA baby boy and it was no secret he was my husband's favorite. Our home is so quiet, so newly calm. His brothers, rat terrier, Stark, and black Labrador, Harold, seem completely normal, but suddenly chill. Targ was certainly the instigator of all the chaos and rough housing.

We dug his burial plot in the backyard today and will be picking him up from PetCare on Tuesday after the kids come home. We will miss him."

Then, select one of the highlighted location options to move it to, and then reactivate it (1 wheat). Also, if you want to join our Discord group, I'll send you the details in your reddit messages."

And the C&K is separate from the base game too. You can buy individual games or in bundles. There's Base, Seafarers, Cities and Knights, C& K Special Scenarios (my personal favorite), & Rivals (2-player game). Seriously though check it out. You can play the computer for free, but it's the same board over and over again. It's addictive 100%."

Catan,fmriin4,t1_fmpi4r8,1586324242.0,You are very welcome.
Catan,fmlnnm5,t1_fmlgwzs,1586189874.0,"It is literally the most thrilling expansion IMHO. My husband and I started playing Settlers of Catan four years ago and quickly discovered the other versions were easy to learn but had quite a few, more exciting differences still.

If you already know how to play the Cities & Knights version, then you can play Enchanted Land, because it's 95% C&K, with a few ships from Seafarers, and they sprinkled in 19 Dragons! 

*Note: VPs to Win: 3 players = 21 VPs or 6 Dragons, 4 players = 18 VPs or 6 Dragons*

To fight a Dragon, you must build your knight on the main island and transport it over to the Dragon Island. There are a few moves you have to make before you're in position to fight, and you can only make one move per turn. 

Players can complete one of the below items during each turn. 
1) Transport your Knight to the coast of Dragon Island. Reactivate your Knight using a Wheat (Feed your Knight) 
2) Move your Knight onto a Dragon (Knights may only be moved up to three spaces, but can never be moved through another players knight.) Reactivate your Knight using a Wheat (Feed your Knight) 
3) Fight the Dragon. Reactivate it using a Wheat (Feed your Knight) *You know how your Knights can be three different levels? Well, the Dragons are three different levels too! But, you don't know which level each are until you try to fight one. It's risky to fight with a basic Knight because there is approximately 33% win rate. Fighting with a Strong Knight increases to 66% win rate. And fighting with a Mighty Knight is 100% win rate.*
4) Move your Knight onto another Dragon (Reactivate your Knight using a Wheat (Feed your Knight) 
5) Repeat. 

Special Notes: 
1) Only one Knight on the Dragon Island allowed per player.
2) No one can build roads on the Dragon Island, only ships around the perimeter.
3) Players can build settlements on the Dragon Island, but not Cities.
4) Like in regular Cities and Knights, you can only upgrade to a Mighty Knight after achieving the Science Bonus (coins earned from Cities on Ore hexes) 

There are many other things to consider, but this is a quick explanation.

I hope you log in and put some energy into Catan Universe. BTW, you'll have to buy the Special Scenarios expansion from the Bundles in the Shop. Send me and my husband a Friend Request: RNA4EVA and TheBestRhett

KRAS or NRAS mutations may also be common in BCR/ABL negative CML (35% in a multicenter study) [Wang et al. 2014]."" which literally says BCR/ABL Negative IS CML - Please note that I received the test results well before he and I communicated. It was only after I messaged him through the hospital app that he said this, but he did not explain the text results very well - leaving the doubt - and reddit has been a supportive, educational, and helpful place for information.

depression,fdanw9i,t3_ek3uky,1578248192.0,"If someone has never felt depression, it is very very difficult to understand it. Because depression and a psych ward are a part of this situation, I wouldn't be surprised if these two were confiding in each other about not understanding it all, which always creates a slippery slope. They had something in common and are human beings (and my gut tells me you're all very young too). I am certainly not condoning their actions, but I do believe it's human nature. Throughout our lives, we must expect to fall in and out of love so many times, and we must expect to have our hearts broken many many times, and me must expect to break others hearts many many times... Relationships are trial and error... Just like depression meds... You try one, it doesn't work for you... You try another, and it doesn't work for you... You try another, and it doesn't work either... But each time, you REALLY want it to work... And so you keep trying until it is right... And it can take a while. Right? With people, we'll want a relationship to work so desperately that we'll stay in it way longer than the expiration date to try to make it work, but unfortunately, it doesn't. In the back of your mind, you have to keep reminding yourself that you'll have trial and errors for most everything (boy/girlfriends, careers, neighborhoods, cities, states, pizza toppings), and you learn from each of these experiences what will work for you. I wish you strength throughout your life."

zoloft,fctci62,t3_eipzxw,1577938974.0,"Hi fuzz, I second the last comment. On October 7 of this year, I noticed that the left side of my husband's mouth and near his left eye were just slightly different. No one else noticed it even afterwards, but no one looks at him the same way I do (being his wife). In fact, he didn't even notice it, because many men don't ""really"" look at themselves in the face very often. I Googled it and it immediately took me to the FAST test. https://vsearch.nlm.nih.gov/vivisimo/cgi-bin/query-meta?v%3Aproject=medlineplus&v%3Asources=medlineplus-bundle&query=Fast+stroke+

1) He had the slight droop. 
2) He held his arms up perfectly.
3) When I read, ""Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence,"" he responded with, ""Ask the person to repeat a sTimple sentence."" 

He stared at himself for a couple of minutes, and then we went to the emergency room. 

EVERY INTERACTION WITH EVERY PERSON started with the FAST test. He was seen immediately and he wasn't even convinced there was any issue. He did actually have a stroke that day, PLUS, there was history on his EKG of a stroke in the past (that no one knew about). 

Because of this, they discovered he had a hole in his heart, which they are 85% sure was the cause. He just had the hole in his heart closed on Friday (literally like it was NOTHING!) - NO PAIN MEDS were even prescribed afterwards because it was such a simple procedure! (I'm still in shock). 

Also, my husband is VERY COMPETITIVE, so he was determined to pass any tests they gave him. In fact, when he fake smiles, you can't see the droop, but when he's genuinely smiling or laughing, it's kind of like an adorable back slash. He was VERY VERY LUCKY.

My point: Go to the ER. Yes, do the FAST test first, but be very honest with yourself if you don't have someone else helping you with it."

1) I joined the King of Catan (KoC) guild in Catan Universe. If you do this, you might want to Friend Request Treeckosaurus. 
2) Then I joined the King of Catan Discord server. You'll have to download the Discord App on either mobile or desktop, then you have to be invited to join. 
I found Treeckosaurus on Facebook through the Catan Universe Facebook page. He is who started the KoC Discord server. It is a very active group with 176 (as of today) players from around the globe. The skill level ranges from noob to global Catan Tournaments competitors.
I love playing Enchanted Land, in the Special Scenarios (a Cities & Knights expansion) and the #1 ranked player of this game is a KoC member. I have learned so much from him and all the other players too!
It's free to join, but you have to own at least the CU Base Game. Or, I guess you can create new accounts each time and use a scroll (I don't recommend that though)
KoC hosts an ongoing tournament for the 4-player base game only (where you can win a small cash prize) and there is also a ""floating"" King or Queen of Catan title that you can win by simply challenging and then beating the current King/Queen of Catan.
Honestly, both me and my husband play every day and we both feel like we've made some great friends around the globe. It's a very friendly and positive community and we're planning on keeping it that way (realizing how tough that can be for some players). If you are interested, let me know. But TBH, I don't know how I can get the invitation link to you. You'll have to let me know, because I need to send it to you directly. Hope this helps! - Angela (RNA4EVA on CU and Discord)"
