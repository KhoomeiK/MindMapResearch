Anxiety,fc7lv9f,t3_egkgv0,1577511681.0,"Yes all the time !! It mostly happens when I'm sad, but I think it's also happened a few times when I've been stressed too. Most of the time it's hard to communicate with others when I'm like this, but thankfully some of my friends and I know sign language (they teach ASL at my school so there's a lot of people who know it around where I am) so if this happens when I'm with one of them, we can still kinda communicate. Anyways, I totally get what you're saying and it's nice to know I'm not alone because this happens to me a lot"

WaltDisneyWorld,f4l57se,t3_dkt1b8,1571662478.0,"Hollywood studios is actually really fun! I went to Disney a few years ago with my school and my friends and I had a really fun time. I'm not a big roller coaster or ""big ride"" kind of person, but the tower or terror and the rock n roller coaster in the back were a lot of fun to go on. And like someone else said, the have the little mermaid and a beauty and the beast show thing there too which is fun. There's also toy story mania and a few star wars things that would also be cool to check out. While Hollywood studios may not have the most stuff, it definitely is still something that's worth taking a look around because who knows what you'll find!"
Anxiety,f3oej1l,t3_dhisno,1571015762.0,"I can understand that. Driving can be stressful!! I've had my license for about a year and a half now so I'm not really a pro by any means, but I do know you're definitely not stupid for not having it. I kind of put off getting mine just because I didn't want to make mistakes on the road and have people get mad at me. But in reality, everyone makes mistakes when driving! Even people who have had their license for a while. I see people make mistakes all the time, even myself. So if you're worried about making mistakes, just know that learning how to drive is an ongoing process, and nobody is a pro right out of the gate so you don't need to compare yourself to others. Also some more advice that might help (hopefully) if there's any less crowded areas you could drive around just to get more comfortable driving a car, take a bit of time out of the day to practice there. Getting to know how to use the vehicle in a less crowded area gives you the chance to take things at your own pace, unlike being thrown into a busy situation right away. 

I really hope some of this helped, and I hope you get your license soon! I know you can do it :)"
