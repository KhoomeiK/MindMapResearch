Society as a whole has a view of how women and men are supposed to act, ideal qualities they're supposed to have physically and in their actions, etc. Those are still harmful to women and men. So, for example, boys being told to toughen up, the phrase ""man up"" or similar are shaming men for showing emotion or weakness in some regard, women are called nags or bitches when being assertive whereas men are typically rewarded for it, etc. Women are essentially taught to be more submissive, and men are taught to be assertive and dominant. 

So, when people grow up, this conditioning effects how people act in the workplace, in their personal relationships, marketing is done in such a way so as to cater to this thinking, etc. Opportunity in the workplace is still biased as far as who is hired and promoted in this regard (think arguments about wage gaps), relationships are frequently abusive physically or mentally (this can go both ways between men and women of course, but being raised to be believe women should be submissive isn't helping), sexual assault is soooo common (the vast majority of which goes unreported), etc.

The role of feminism is to challenge the ideas behind the gender roles in society, and address the damage that they're doing. There are some people that are lucky or not in a position to see the effects of this, and that's good, but it does still have a major impact on a lot of people.

I'm not sure what your understanding is of (the specific and at the same time and extremely vague) mental health issues you mentioned, but if someone's able to knowingly consent to sex, then they're able to knowingly consent to sex. 

If you have PTSD or CPTSD, as an adult you know what your triggers are. It's one thing for someone to guess that something might be one, it's a whole other ball game for someone to tell you no, this isn't okay because it's a trigger for your PTSD.... But that consent goes both ways, if you're not comfortable with saying those things during sex, then you have the right to say no. 


> history of abuse (and related compulsive behavior)

I'm not even sure what this means, exactly.

People are also allowed to be upset (I think it's not so much about just eating a cake as much as the opposite-of-thoughtful gesture). If someone does something hurtful and later apologizes, is the person supposed to stop being hurt immediately or it becomes about the antagonist's feelings?

Different foods have a different glycemic index (how much they will effect your blood sugar levels/glucose levels). Certain foods (like foods high in sugar/natural sugar) will make your blood sugar go up higher/faster. Your body will respond to too much glucose by releasing insulin, which takes some of that extra fuel and stores it as fat for when it's needed. If you're diabetic or have health issues like functional or reactive hypoglycemia, your body isn't releasing insulin properly or at all and that can cause some serious, and sometimes immediate, health issues. But for most people, the body handles the glucose levels in your blood just fine.

You can google the glycemic index to check out specific fruits or vegetables, bread, specific meats, etc. Not all fruits are created equal, same as veggies, etc. 

All that said, fruit has a lot of healthy stuff that goes with it, whereas plain old sugar, not so much. So, if you don't have health issues that effect your body handling blood sugar levels properly, eating an orange is a lot healthier than eating a chocolate bar and contains vitamins, etc that your body needs. 

You can get vitamin c and other things your body needs from say just meat, but it's difficult. You'd have to eat a lot of organ meat, fish eggs, etc and you'd likely have to take suppliments and check in with your doctor to make sure your body is getting enough vitamins and minerals. 

Diets, like the keto diet, that basically cut out things with sugar (natural and artificial) are still pretty controversial, and people who study this still don't agreee across the board whether this is healthy or unhealthy. It still needs some more research.

If they were at a point in their lives where they wanted to focus on their education or career, wanted to travel/work abroad, wanted to enjoy their, say, 20's without being tied down (maybe they had a lot of friends that got married early and had kids right away), or maybe they were getting into relationships/flings with the wrong people (maybe they grew up in an unhealthy environment and picking a person that's a good fit was a learning curve). Either way, someone who spent a long time without being in a long term relationship was being honest with themselves and others about what they wanted. I think that's a lot more admirable than someone who leads people on or is a cronic cheater.

If someone who has been with a lot of people, say the 70 you gave in an example, is saying that they're ready to settle down, and they seem like a good fit for you and vice versa, then maybe they are.

Being sensitive and not knowing how to protect yourself opens a door. Serious illness (physical or mental) can open a door. Reaching out to someone online with a problem with this stuff is sometimes enough to open a door. Lots of things can open that door, and people sometimes need some serious help that isn't readily available when this goes south. It's not as simple as saying goodbye. 

There are specific meditations that people do for protection, and even then they aren't a guarantee. 

I've personally dealt with more than just a scratch one time. I'm speaking as someone with some very real and scary experience in this stuff and knowledge in it, and I'm telling you that you've been lucky."

I'd get a second opinion if you're worried. Maybe see a reiki healer. But I wouldn't mention what the first psychic said. I definately wouldn't fork over more money so that she could fix those invisible things, though. That sounds like a major red flag/scammy thing to me."

Ghosts,etvtq65,t3_cdipun,1563244481.0,"No, that shit's dangerous. You're basically throwing out an invitation to anything and everything, and if stuff goes south, think really carefully about what you would do to fix it. Where would you go for help, I mean really...where would you get help? 

I mean, bears are cool, and running into one would would make for a good story, but hanging out in the deep wilderness wearing a suit of bacon maybe isn't smart. 

Go on a ghost walk if you want the thrill or you're just curious."

AskReddit,etqsasx,t3_cczmpw,1563100139.0,"Law, no, but an option to earn grant money towards schooling, yes. 

There are too many people that might not be able to do this for one reason or another (single parents, caring for family, existing work schedules, health issues that are physical and/or mental, availability in your area, transportation, etc). 

It would have to pay more towards school than a full-time minimum wage job, though, otherwise people would loose that option of putting that time into a job that might pay better than minimum wage and end up making it harder to afford schooling."

AskReddit,etp5lrd,t1_etp3bxj,1563046353.0,"I mean, sure, they find that sweet spot between reps being consistently busy and customers being made to wait (typically 10+ minutes) and not loosing business (to the point that lost profits exceed the cost of more reps). But squeezing every last drop of money out of call center times the way that's become commonplace isn't necessarily a good business model, if employee turn over rates/mental health and customer satisfaction matter at all. 

My main point, though, was just that the wait times don't keep customers calm and understanding. It makes a lot of people frustrated and angry before the call starts, and half expecting to be blown off (reps are majorly stressed to keeps their avg times low or risk getting fired and this happens quite a bit)."

Yes. Someone else can be attractive without you acting like a creep. 

If I walked out my front door right now and there were some convention of ripped guys pouring water on themselves or doing whatever tf, I could easily walk through them and go about my day without harrassing them. It's actually pretty easy to not act like a creep."
