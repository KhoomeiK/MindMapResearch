abuse,fqo6e2x,t1_fqnc5vc,1589508505.0,"I'm so happy you're prioritizing your own safety/health!! You're incredibly strong, I know you can do this!!"
abuse,fql7zts,t3_gitd63,1589449478.0,"Definitely sexual assault. No matter the intensity of said assault, it could have lasting effects on your life and I hiiighly recommend therapy! It's helped me cope with my own sexual abuse as a child and when you find the right therapist, it's so amazing."
abuse,fql7ry3,t1_fql7gdl,1589449257.0,"That's definitely abuse. I'm so so sorry that you have to go through that. As much as you want to stand up for your sister, it will most likely put you in harms way which could possibly escalate the abuse. I know it's so incredibly scary to think about something like this, but there are so many resources in place to help kids like you and your sister. You could call the cops, CPS, an abuse hotline, etc. Neither you or your sister should suffer through such an abusive household. You deserve a million times better."
abuse,fql7ggv,t3_gizt4k,1589448928.0,"Jesus, I am so so so sorry. This is 100% abusive. I hope you can seek therapy and heal from so many years with him. You are so incredibly strong and absolutely none of this is your fault."
abuse,fql75ay,t3_gj4939,1589448609.0,"You're not overreacting at ALL! I don't wanna diagnose considering I'm not a professional but she sounds like a massive narcissist and incredibly emotionally abuse/controlling. As someone who's dealt with abuse in the past, I would 100% say that this is an abusive situation. I'm so sorry you have to go through that. Please stay strong and stay safe. It might be a good idea to seek therapy as soon as it's possible to do so."
abuse,fql6pxs,t1_fqgg8ed,1589448175.0,"This community is one of my favorites because of things like this. You deserve all the love and support in the world! If you need someone to vent to, I've got nothing but time! Please stay strong and stay safe!"
abuse,fql6fwg,t1_fqkbu4n,1589447897.0,"Honestly, you could call the cops next time she's being abusive. The law still urges people to report abuse. You could also talk to an abuse hotline or call CPS. Please stay safe and know your mother is the only one in the wrong here. You're so much stronger than you know."
abuse,fql67c2,t3_gj9syy,1589447658.0,Please tell her about the abuse you endured from him if you feel safe to do so. It's easy to accept abuse directed towards yourself but knowing it's being directed towards a friend is a completely different ball game. I think being honest and telling her about his abusive tendencies is something she deserves since she's in a potentially harmful relationship. Please stay safe!
abuse,fql5to4,t3_gjgpcz,1589447282.0,"If any hands are laid on you, that is 100% physical abuse. If they are negatively affecting your physical health, I would also consider that physical abuse. I don't know your exact situation so I can't comment on that but please stay safe and stay strong!"
abuse,fql5on7,t3_gjg2xt,1589447137.0,"I'm so sorry this is happening to you but he is definitely extremely abusive. If possible, avoid confrontation with him and talk to your mom/other adults in your life that you trust and see how they can help! If you ever need someone to vent to, I've got nothing but time and would love to help as best as I can. Please stay safe! You're so much stronger than you know!"

ptsd,fh2bynt,t3_f10a26,1581245350.0,"This might be too difficult/too costly, but honestly with the issues with the outside world, it sounds to me that a service animal would benefit you greatly. I'm no psychiatrist or professional, but PTSD service dogs can do so much good especially for people that have seizures. Definitely something to discuss with your therapist but besides that, maybe small things like walks around your neighborhood with your partner or spending some time in your yard to ease your mind into viewing the outside world as a place that can be relaxing. Sidenote: having these feelings don't make you anything like your ex, you're incredibly brave for being able to get away from someone like that. As scary as getting a new therapist can be, I think and hope that it will help you to heal and grow. Have a lovely day <3"
ptsd,fh1ykxc,t1_fgtslm1,1581228334.0,"its so frustrating to feel like peoples perspective of what we go through on a daily basis can be boiled down to just ""awwh im upset cause this happened!"" its so unfortunate that this is a thing we have to get used to because others are too ignorant to think before they trivialize something thats already heavily misunderstood"
skinwalkers,fe8zemh,t1_fe8n055,1578932541.0,Have you taken her to the vet for her terrible smell? Or the fact that she possibly has just stopped taking care of herself? Or for her trauma? Stop being so defensive over people giving you honest critiques and take into consideration that you are not doing right by this cat by going on the internet and calling this poor thing a skinwalker.

I truly do hope that you find a tight knit group of people that will make you feel like you're on top of the world during future birthdays to come. If no one else is gonna show up for now, as hard as it sounds, be your own biggest fan. You are strong and I may be just a strange Redditor but I hope you have an amazing day with many more amazing days to come. <3"

depression,f6ogl6k,t3_ds8rdp,1573017132.0,"i've had days where it's hard to even picture myself with a history book that has any substance besides a high school student that was never bound to make it to 18. im having one of those days today, i came on this subreddit to wallow but i found this and i hope you dont mind OP but i think im gonna write down the parts i particularly like on some post its to yell at future sad bitch me. thank you for taking time out of your day to give this lump a kick in the ass. the world needs more people like you."
