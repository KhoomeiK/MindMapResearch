deadtome,fqxhxs2,t3_gk1hgr,1589732560.0,Welp.. I’m scrolling reddit while watching season 2; so for me that means I’m checked out. It’s sad when a great season 1 turns into a dumpster fire in season 2. I’ll most likely not finish S2.
HuluLive,fqq9gi8,t3_gilivq,1589561665.0,"I started with Hulu live in summer 2018. It was SO cheap (like $45-50!)FFW 2 years later now it's like $75/month.

Cons: For a while I hated Hulu Live, a lot of technical errors, very glitchy, Live sports was iffy, interface was annoying. I never quite understood how certain features worked..like 'my stuff'. Sometimes shit would record a million times and I couldn't figure out why. You can't just tune to a channel, you have to scroll the whole guide 1 by 1 (at least on a Roku Ultra). Hulu was missing some channels I wanted like Comedy Central, MTV.. (Hallmark for the gf)

Pros: overall I think it's cheaper considering you can get the cloud dvr as well as Hulu library. I loved it because you can watch anything anywhere, start a show in living room continue in bedroom. Having the Hulu library, connected to the live is really nice to have it all in one place. If there's a show you want to watch and you forgot to 'DVR' it; 9/10 times it would be uploaded in the Hulu library.

I now moved to a condo where they offer free basic cable so my bill is now $85 for internet and TV. I was paying $150 before for internet & Hulu Live. ($75 for internet and $75 for Hulu)

I feel like I've gone back in time and am missing the technology of Hulu. I have 2 giant cable boxes now..only 1 tv has DVR.. and it's weird. I'll give it a try for a couple months, I may end up going back to Hulu.

PS One thing I loved about Hulu was that you get TBS & adult swim east and west. I love those channels (esp Conan and Family Guy reruns) and I miss that. However on the flip side, with regular cable I get a few of those weird local channels that play seinfeld and sitcom reruns... so pros and cons I guess.."
depression,fq9qkre,t3_ghdi7l,1589204963.0,"I always compare myself to my bro and sis. We all grew up the same.. etc. Them 2 are so 'normal'. Married, kids, career.. What happened to me? Why am I like this? Those 2 took the route of religion; I am so jealous of their delusional blissfulness. I would kill to just accept that belief and be 'happy' in life. Even if it's not real. 

But I gotta say; they put in the effort. They go every Sunday, and get involved..."

DoesAnybodyElse,fpldylm,t1_fpky34d,1588711000.0,Couldn't agree more. I'm born and raised/living in Tampa area. The last 5-10 years I've gotten so sick of the summers here. The older I've gotten I've noticed just how much of a better mood I'm in during Dec - May. Being outside is enjoyable and not irritating.

Also I was kind of bummed because in March the segway site had the Max for sale for $799 with a $100 visa card rebate.. I guess I should of pulled the trigger at that time. I asked if they would match it, and they said no. 

Anyway, I've been wanting to express this..lol"

Conan is the GOAT."
