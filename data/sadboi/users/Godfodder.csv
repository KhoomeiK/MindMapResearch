And when we get to it I know exactly what she likes and I know for damn sure she's satisfied, and vice versa. After this many years together our sex is better than ever; there's no ego, there's no fear of what the other person is thinking, there's no worry about their history or health, if something embarrassing happens we'll laugh together, and it's all done out of mutual love and respect for the other person and not out of pure lust which, I feel, does not lead to fulfillment. I do not mind revisiting the same vagina because I haven't been bored of it, just like I trust she isn't bored of my dick. 

As far as kids and wives being boring and meaningless, I'm not going to make arguments why you're wrong; some people are just wired differently and that's OK. Don't have kids if you don't want them. But there's a reason why Dad's love their kids, and it's because it's fucking awesome.

Currently at 225lbs and I notice my chest, head and pelvis just feel more aligned and my knuckles aren't facing forward. This is a benefit to working out which makes me feel better, but as a bonus it projects confidence in the room both socially and mentally. 

Next time you're out take a look at how many guys have their shoulders hunched over, craning their necks forward. It's something women pick up on. 

Also, because OP asked and because I have no one to share any of this with, it's really hilarious how often women check out guy's chests. I'm fortunate to have a broad chest now and I understand (to a degree) how women feel when they face a guy and their eyes immediately dart down and up again. Which is to say kind of nice, but also leave me alone. 

An extra perk: the service industry is waaaay nicer to you. I've had a couple cashiers/waitresses throw in something extra. That shit never happened when I was heavy. 

Ultimately I don't think it's physical attraction thing initially, I think they're naturally attracted to guys who show their body respect by maintaining it. And *then* then the physical attraction takes a second look.

Sometimes you need to consider what makes a cheap meal. Sometimes a cheap meal is cheap because it yields leftovers. That's why we go through a lot of turkeys. 

- Chili is great when you plan ahead and are able to portion it out and freeze. 

- Shepherd's pie can go a long way. 

- Curry can be very cheap, especially when chicken thighs/drumsticks are on sale. 

- Spaghetti carbonara is simple, as you just need a bit of cheese, an egg, and (if desired) a pork product like bacon. 

- There are all kinds of things you can do with roasts. A pork loin, for example, can be divided so you have a small roast for yourself and slice the rest up into pork chops for another meal, or pulled pork.

Some other tips:

- Buy frozen veggies. The quality isn't always the same, but they are just as nutritious as fresh and will produce far less waste. (Very cheap for stir frying, tacos, etc)

- Rice goes far. Don't buy instant rice, you have time to cook rice while you're getting the rest of your dish together. Nobody needs rice in two minutes. 

- Plan your meals ahead. This sucks, but it seriously makes all the difference. And you'll figure out where your ingredients can overlap (Ground beef is on sale? What a good opportunity to plan or shepherd's pie and tacos)

- Learn how to make your own red sauce. It's really not hard, tastes superior to store bought, and can be done cheap. And there's nothing like reaching into a bowl of San Marzano tomatoes and squeezing them all. Make some spaghetti with that ground beef, or some penne with sausage and bell pepper (which can also be purchased frozen). 

One of the cheapest things you can do for yourself is learn how to cook well, so good for you for asking. Once you have the basics under your belt and a few recipes you can throw together confidently you'll find yourself branching off and cooking new meals from scratch. The best feeling is when your wife looks at your empty fridge and cupboards and complains about not having groceries, and you go in behind her and whip up a delicious supper like magic. 

It's an undervalued skill by those who haven't yet learned, and stretches your wallet like crazy."
