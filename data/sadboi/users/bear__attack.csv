sex,fqldqhr,t1_fqla2i3,1589455071.0,"I have noticed that Reddit jumps to this as soon as the OP indicates that they've tried communication and their partner has refused to work on or communicate about said issue. Which, admittedly, you've hinted at. 

If you've tried talking about it, asking them to fix it, and they refuse, then there's no real option left other than (a) wait it out and be miserable or (b) ultimatum / leave. Waiting some time is appropriate, especially for such a long, supposedly otherwise compatible relationship. However, this is vague - how much time is too much time. You can't put a ruler up to your unhappiness and measure when it's crossed the too much line, because it likely ebbs and flows. But there's definitely a point when it has been too much and you are too unhappy. And that's when the sunk cost fallacy really kicks in. And either you keep having the same conversation with your partner over and over again, and maybe you get strung along with a little hope of change, or you decide to stop the cycle.

Don't get me wrong, sometimes the partner changes. Sometimes it's worth waiting. But you can't know that they will; a lot of times they don't. 

And the reason Reddit jumps to ""leave them"" is because you don't actually owe anyone, regardless of how long you've been together, your patience. If you choose to give it, fine, cool. Just know you're not obligated, and leaving IS an option."

psychologyresearch,fptzbxr,t3_gfelle,1588901353.0,"You're asking aome very big and very important questions that do not have simple answers. If they did, the world would be a different place. You also seem to be coming at these questions with a defensive, even political lens. I'm not saying that your position is wrong, but by asking a question in a way that you've built what you think the answer should be into it, you've made it harder to give an objective response. 

That said, I will offer this: the fundamental motivations behind almost all human behavior are the desires to see ourselves as (1) good and (2) accurate. When we interpret a situation or decide how to act or respond, more often we act in our own self interest based on these motivations. Evolutionary psychology also offers additional explanations geared towards perpetuating our genes, but this is more controversial in research.

Second, development is not a simple answer of nature or nature. Both genetics and how we are raised influence the type of people we become--that is, how our brains develop. 

If you have the opportunity to take a social psychology course, I would highly recommend it. The theories and constructs taught in this type of course will help you begin to understand the complexity of the answers to your questions. 

Hope this helps."

I don't think my parents were intentionally abusive. They certainly weren't malicious. They said that it hurt them more than it hurt me. I remember seeing my dad cry before and after spanking me. I remember them reminding each other to not be angry while punishing my brother and I. They genuinely thought they had to spank us, because it was the right thing to do, because they were spanked, because our church said you were supposed to spank kids or they'd turn out bad.

Aphantasia,fmvtcrf,t3_fxguwe,1586430141.0,"I've wondered about this. I started as an art major after loving it in high school, got into a great program, but struggled for lots of reasons and dropped out. Years later, having discovered how strong my aphantasia is, I wonder how much it had to do with my struggles. I'm so glad you've found out about it now and have a plan and determination to overcome this challenge."
