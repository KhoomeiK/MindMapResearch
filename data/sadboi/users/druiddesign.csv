vegan,fqwb3kb,t1_fqwaeml,1589698264.0,"So, I love animals.  But I've seen like many, many, many, more often than not what I would consider animal abuse situations, and I'm not even sure I could claim that I haven't abused animals myself because I look back in regret of my horse riding days and the bits that I used on my horse in specific, as well as the time I hit my cat on the head with a remote control (it WAS accidental) and thought it was funny even though she was terrified.

I think I love the idea of having a pet, that would be like a snuggle buddy and keep me company but ultimately, I don't think it's necessary in life.  If I can't live by myself I should probably be living with another human being in a relationship that is agreeable where we both receive what we need.  Otherwise, alone it is.  

I know the humane society has tons of animals that need adopting (and my own cat who passed away was a rescue too), but I currently can't afford any type of vet care and I think it's selfish to adopt a pet when you have unstable financial situations where you would have to reach out to someone other than your own savings to pay for their expenses/needs.  Same with adding children to your life, so. There's that too.

It sucks that the times I do spend with them are usually focused on eating - like they always turn down suggestions that offer vegan food I would be happy eating and stuff in favor of places that serve salads like these or a plate of fries or a plate of steamed vegetables.  

It actually does make me feel like they don't care about what is important to me, but I guess I probably don't care about what is important to them for them to keep having this argument with me.  Anyway.  I've tried and I'm losing it so bad - I spend so much time just doing things to please them or trying to find things that I think could improve my life and their life but also because the schizoaffective voices in my head keeps telling me THEY ARE THEM but everyone around me and my psych team keeps telling me the voices ""arent real"" and ""just ignore the voices"".

I know you'll achieve whatever you set your mind to.  Stay strong.

I feel like mentioning that though I hardly ever looked at porn until I was in my 30s, and though I don't look at it too often I have felt at times I required it to achieve orgasm.  Which was immediately disappointing from the first time that happened.  So I've been trying to eliminate it from my life too, which isn't too hard.  Without porn I don't get off in terms of visual - it's all about the stimulation and feeling which is much more satisfying - so if you are still masturbating I hope it's a healthier habit in check for you (that you do because it brings enjoyment to your life, not as an addiction)."

I cooked a family pack of chicken thighs with a recipe my mom made that I enjoyed at her place.  But when I cooked them I realized how disgusting it was.  Not only did the animals die, but now I had animal fat and bones to clean up.  It looked like a murder scene and I was disgusted.  Also when I woke up the morning after eating some of the chicken I felt like throwing up.  I felt literally nauseous.

Previous to that, the only meat I had been eating was canned tuna, ground beef or meat purchased in food cooked outside of my home (usually like restaurants/takeout).  

So, now I'm vegan.  I have 18 eggs left and 9 cans of tuna.  I have some products that contain dairy and egg and small traces of animal products.  I might donate what I can to a food bank.

It's another case of ""if you don't enjoy it, you should get out of the industry"" when it's not anything to do with art that ruins it for me.  Anyway, doTERRA brings me normalcy and comfort when everything career wise in life is just aggravating and grinding against me mentally."
TalesFromDF,fpo46w6,t1_fpo0top,1588778066.0,"I have only 1 dps job leveled, but all my DoH and DoL are 80 and I found that a more interesting investment for my time and focus.  I am just starting to level my second DoW/DoM job, which I think will become my main.  So it's nice to be able to stay in generally the best gear + melded quite affordably instead of waiting for duty drops specifically.  

I do try to sell my stuff, if I sell on the mb, at a reasonable price.  If someone approached me off the mb and said ""hey can you craft this + I have the materials!"" I would hands down do it for free!"

I do my consumer research and generally do decide what is good/bad for my own decisions before I purchase for most things."
antiMLM,fpo0zgr,t1_fpnz8zj,1588776411.0,"Okay, so let me tell my doTERRA story.

In the past I was working for a company that had a work perk of a wellness account, so we could spend up to a certain amount on wellness things that increase our overall wellness in various ways - you know, ergonomic office equipment (I did get a nice chair that changed my world!), gym fees/equipment/fitness related, or just wellness like massage or even essential oils and aromatherapy services.  

So I got looking into the benefits of essential oils, and inquired directly to doTERRA for more information for them to hook me up with a rep (I knew it was a MLM but that was about all I knew).  I actually didn't hear back from them, for whatever reason the reply possibly went to spam.  So I didn't join at that time.

Then about a year and a half ago one of the people I follow on social media and found the most influential life advice and inspiration from became a doTERRA wellness advocate.  So I took a chance and joined, and got some oils.  

I was very impressed with the oils and tried a lot of their other products too, I can't say I haven't tried one that I didn't like - but a few I won't purchase again just because I don't need them currently now.  I liked hearing and learning about the origins of the oils and seeing the grower trips where they go to the source and talk about the growth and production of the oils, I really feel affinity with that aspect as I grew up on a grain farm and appreciate hearing about farming/growing plants in other areas of the world too.

There's not too many uses for essential oils that I find useful, like I do not have children so I'm not about to put a child to bed using lavender.  But I do find lavender very soothing at times and will use it for aromatherapy.  As with the other oils, I just use them a lot for aromatherapy reasons.  There are some that stimulate me or calm me down, it truly does work for me, and has been helping me through emotional times.  I have schizoaffective bipolar and have struggled a lot with mental illness but since I started with doTERRA the oils and the inspirations of the community itself have been helping me make sense of my life and find purpose that I feel does make me happy.

I'm not sure if I would be the same person without the oils.  I feel stronger than I did when I joined doTERRA over a year ago.  And yes, it's been expensive, but so is seeing a psychologist and I tried that and it never helped near as much as the oils + oil community have.  I feel like I see the world in different ways now, and with more gratitude too.  So...I don't know.

It's a more complicated subject than just going ""MLMS BAD! CORPORATE GOOD!"" because it's not just about ""how it smells"""

antiMLM,fpnwzec,t1_fpnvy5g,1588774266.0,"Thanks, it's pretty good for what I was looking for I suppose.  I definitely need to think about this for awhile, because I do find MLM products helpful/useful in my life in ways that no other products have been able to compare to so far.

But like, especially with essential oils, I guess all I'm paying for is a prettier bottle and a better scent than other female body products or essential oils.  It does sort of seem like an ego thing.

Norwex makes great cloths that have lasted years and still look brand new, but they are expensive if I have to buy more.  

I don't know. I'll have to find comparable products to replace MLM ones, but I will start looking in my travels."

I do know that the price you grabbed for Bergamot on doTERRA ends up being less for the person purchasing it, it's actually around $29.  That's just a small point though and isn't necessarily argumentatively making the point you were trying to make any less relevant or accurate."

I think rolling need for duty loot is fine if you're the appropriate job/level, but if you upgrade to crafting gear then it duty loot only lasts a couple levels at most usually."

minimalism,fpnerkx,t1_fpn6hil,1588760372.0,"Norwex (they are a MLM that focuses on nontoxic cleaning tools and related items) sells a lot of reusable cloths....so one of their items particularly is a paper towel replacement.

([here is a link to the page for the product i have](https://shopca.norwex.biz/en_CA/customer/shop/product-detail/546882?categoryName=Kitchen)) (if you search the site for 'counter cloths' or look in the kitchen section - there are packs of them without the 'cloth home rack' and they come in different colours too - very high quality, had mine for a couple years and they still feel brand new after washing)

I know you mention that after one use you find your cloths dirty, but I can get one of these cloths to last a few days or a week depending how much I spill.  I just rinse it out in the sink and hang it over the faucet to dry.  They're very rugged and hold mess a lot better than a tea towel or dish cloth."
