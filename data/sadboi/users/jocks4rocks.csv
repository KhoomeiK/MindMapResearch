geologycareers,ew66h1o,t3_cmym4b,1565155730.0,"BS in geoscience here. Getting a job is tough if you don't have at least an MS, but it's doable. The pay for entry level with just a BS, at least in the US, is not great.

As a lot of people have said, CS will definitely pay better and offer you more opportunities in the future.

*HOWEVER*, keep in mind the experiential limitations associated with each major.

For example, in geoscience, the fieldwork, labs, and research opportunities you can get through your classes/professors is invaluable. While studying geoscience, you can do some pretty cool things that you might not be able to do elsewhere/in the real world.

I don't know much about CS, but maybe you'll miss out on some really cool projects like coding for a robot or something (clearly I have no idea what happens as a CS major but this sounds legit lol).

I can't tell you what to do, but in my opinion, anyone can learn CS. Hell, I'm doing it now. It's hard without an academic background but it's doable.

A geoscience major will provide you with more of those ""I can't do this anywhere else"" opportunities.

Combining the two would make you a competitive applicant once you enter the workforce so if you can double major or major/minor in both, that's great! But if you must choose one or the other, pick the one that you think will give you a more valuable undergrad experience.

Good luck!"

Great to know that there may be a card table at the reception, though! A card with some money sounds like a practical fallback.

Out of curiosity, is there a typical amount people include in the cards? Mostly asking bc everyone here is pretty young (early 20s) and just getting started in our careers. I personally can't afford a generous gift bc I am still looking for a full time job and paying off student loans with what I've saved over the years.

As for the food, I'm not seriously allergic; I only get a reaction when I eat them and it's very mild (swollen lips, general discomfort around lips/throat).

Their menu options are vegan penne alla vodka and vegan surf and turf. Apparently vegan penne alla vodka typically uses cashews as a substitution for cream. I have no clue what vegan surf and turf entails (guessing part of it is tofu). Seeing as tree nuts are a common allergy, I'm guessing (hoping) one or both dishes won't have nuts. Either way, I think your idea of bringing a snack is the way to go.

UCONN,esow3ge,t3_c8olsz,1562175112.0,"This is very long but it's basically a comprehensive guide to non-dorm campus housing.

To answer your questions:

>How quickly do these suites fill up?

These are the first to go during housing selection, which is based on the number of credits you have. Typically these are all filled up on the first day of housing selection, which happens in March/April. Rising (college) seniors usually live here if they don't move off campus and some juniors might have enough credits as well.

>Are we better off looking at one vs the other?

When you do have enough credits, you'll want to assess where the best place to live is based on number of credits and make a housing plan that way. My credits were in the 120s when choosing for my senior year, which I knew was good enough for a 4p/4b Hilltop apartment. By the time you're choosing housing for sophomore year, you'll have a general sense of where you might be able to get housing with the credits you accrued during first semester.

Notes:

4p/4b and 2p/2b Hilltop Apartments (note: **very** different from Hilltop Dorms) are the most sought after location/housing situation, so they'll fill up fast.

4p/4b in Charter Oak (apartments) is less desirable since it's at the top of Mt. Busby (Busby hill if you're not familiar lol, it's a huge hill). They'll still fill up fast tho.

4p/2b (South suites, Mansfield Apartments) might be easier to get into but even still you won't be able to get this type of housing until junior year, sophomore year if you're real ambitious or have connections (tryna keep this short but lmk if you're wondering how this helps). Mansfield is a far walk but it's an apartment. Not sure how fast these fill up compared to South.

There are also 6p/2b suites (Busby, Garrigus) if you're still dead set on living with your 3 friends after freshman year. You can get one of these the soonest (still won't be until sophomore/junior year, again depending on credits). Garrigus will fill up faster than Busby (remember Mt. Busby).

>And do the suites have a common area/living room or is it just 2 bedrooms (or 4) all connected together?

Hilltop Apartments, Charter Oak, and Mansfield Apartments are all, as you can guess from the name, apartments and *not* suites. This means they all have 2 or 4 bedrooms, a living room, and a kitchen. Hilltop and Charter Oak also have a washer/dryer in the apartment. Mansfield has a communal laundry room like all other housing options on campus.

Busby and Garrigus are suites. They're two 3p bedrooms connected by a bathroom. That's the only common area between you and the other bedroom.

South is also a suite. It's 2 bedrooms with a living room and a bathroom. The primary thing differentiating it from an apartment is the lack of a private kitchen.

>For those who have lived in these suites, does it ever feel to cramped or busy?

I have lived in Busby (soph), Garrigus (junior), and 4p/4b Hilltop Apartments (senior). Busby rooms/bathrooms are bigger than Garrigus rooms/bathrooms so depending on how you lay out the room, Busby is less cramped than Garrigus. How busy/cramped it feels also depends on how often your roommates are in the room but if you do need an escape, there are communal lounges in both buildings where you can hang out or study. I've personally never felt cramped in either suite but I can't say the same for everyone.

Hilltop was really roomy since it is an apartment and I had my own private bedroom if I wanted to be alone.

I had friends who lived in South and their bedrooms and common room are pretty big so I can't imagine it would be super cramped there. Mansfield Apartments is 2 floors so it's got tons of space, but the bedrooms seem small.


As other people have said, you won't get any of these with your friends during your freshman year. You also won't get to choose where you live, but you can choose a roommate. You and your friends can pair up if you want but I'd honestly recommend going random. Living with friends sounds nice until they drive you fucking nuts.

Feel free to ask me any questions you've got. Good luck!

Fitness,esnnp81,t3_c8i855,1562140516.0,"Ok this is long but...

Find an active hobby that you like and would want to get better at. For example, I climb. It's fun and feels more like a fun challenge than a workout. I also know that the only way to improve the grades I climb is to train consistently. A lot of people think it's just arms but climbing also works legs, abs, finger strength, and flexibility.

Also if you're into team sports, find an adult league. It's a nice way to cross train and meet new people. I'm into track and field (emphasis on the field) so I found an adult track team. Working out with other people and wanting to help a team succeed is very motivating and pushes you to want to be better. I'm also looking for a soccer league for this reason.

Since climbing can be tough on my hands, I alternate my lift/climb days with my track practice days. Monday/Wednesday lifting (upper body one day, lower body the other) and climbing after, Tuesday/Thursday cardio (sprints) with the track team, Friday/Saturday/Sunday will be long runs (2+ miles) or climbing, depending on the weather and my plans. I take at least one of those days off but typically work out 5-6 days a week with this schedule. Sometimes I'll shake it up with a hike or just take a 30+ min walk, but either way it's all about staying active in a way that's fun for you.

Bonus: combine both of these hobbies by competing in obstacle course races! It'll give you something to work for and you'll probably be more motivated to do well since you paid for it and can't just ditch without losing money.


Tl;dr find an active hobby and/or a recreational sports team and/or enter a race that you'll want to train for
