But then I smell fresh soy, my next victim. I knew I couldn’t let it get away so I stalked my prey. I watched as the tofu stayed laying on the ground...I would catch it soon as the STRONGER and SMARTER mammal, because that’s just how the animal kingdom works. It’s the circle of life bruhhhh. And then, when the soy was least suspecting it I pounced. A natural carnivore at its finest. Take notes, soy boy. This is the way it’s been for centuries."

I try to practice on little tiny things to help with big things. Like for me not being heard when I self advocate is really triggering for me and tend to either not do it or give up easily. When my thought start ruminating around a big, juicy topic like  “don’t even try, it’s not worth it” etc I might not be ready to sit with why I feel that way but I’ll start by excusing myself to use the bathroom during class when my initial urge is to keep learning and ignore my body.

Freckle was a large fluffy brown and blonde calico (i said she was gold) I was abused growing up and Freckle ran towards the screams and violence to sit on our laps. Never met a cat that went towards loud noises!! Losing her was like losing a sibling. Guess I kinda wanted to see her again in a way. Frodo came from an abusive home before getting abandoned. He’s so resilient and strong. He was described as a shy and skittish cat. Now we can’t get him off our lap and says hi to everyone. I still wanna see Freckle but there’s a spirit in Frodo that is so kismet.
