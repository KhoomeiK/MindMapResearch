BabyWitch,fpul9lu,t3_gf9cjx,1588915924.0,hi!! i‚Äôm also a baby (practicing for around 6 months) but one thing that i‚Äôve found works for me is envisioning someone i couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about in an awful way in bright white light and sending her off ~ white candles dressed in an essential oil i align with healing also work nicely :-) don‚Äôt be hard on yourself if this doesn‚Äôt work the first time!!

I started telling him about my trauma with saying that I have a lot of anxiety - I started dating him before my PTSD diagnosis, so I wasn‚Äôt lying really. Then after we built up trust, I told him the full story and what my triggers were. The first time I had a panic attack during s*x he actually wasn‚Äôt aware of what I‚Äôd been through, but he did a fantastic job of holding me and calming me down, so I knew I had a good person :-)"

I do believe many people have the right intentions for doing things like calling people out and holding them accountable for their actions or bringing up social justice issues regularly, but I also believe that a lot of people are just in it for the clout, which is completely not the point.
