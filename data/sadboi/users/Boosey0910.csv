OpiatesRecovery,fpcpjw8,t3_gcmla8,1588508954.0,"Exercise.  Journal. Meditate. Learn a new language online or take up a new artistic hobby. Maybe volunteer in some shape or form. Although during lockdown this could be tough. Eat a super clean diet.  I went 100% plant based during my recovery and I believe that helped me heal. It takes time my friend to heal your brain, etc,  The sleep will improve, the urges will get less. I don't know much about kratom but I'd listen to those chiming in about it.  Good luck. You got this!!  Keep reaching out for support as many of us can relate to your journey"

Fitness,fnfkb6j,t3_g1fdz3,1586909726.0,Just start by some short walks.   Then you can walk a bit farther and longer as you progress.  Ease into it.  We all had to start somewhere.  And if you clean up your diet and eat as many Whole Foods as possible the weight will come off.
fuckeatingdisorders,fndf1ng,t3_g14mqs,1586868403.0,This is great.  Use this quarantine time to your advantage.  Keep it up.  Your body is the best guide as to when to eat and how much.

I won't get on a bike again until the pain is gone.  Just hoping to get to walking again this week.  It's just a small pain under the left kneecap now.  Right knee is fine. Doing stretches, quad strengthening exercises. Rolling out the IT band, hamstrings, etc.   I was using a different exercise bike at my gym, not a spin bike.  Tight cleats really did my poor knees in. And I'll get a proper bike fit consult once things open up again."

I wasn't properly fitted on the bike and wore cleats with no play so was locked in.  After 4 days of overdoing it I had unbearable knee pain in both knees. It is still painful to walk and go up and down stairs.  Had a virtual appt. with my orthopedist today. Said, overuse and tendonitis.  I was wondering if I had a tear but he said he thought overuse based on him watching me walk and that a tear or pop would present itself differently.  Advil, rest, ice and gentle stretching. Now on day 13 from no exercise.  I feel a tiny bit better today but these things can take awhile to heal.  So get online with a doc if you can."

OpiatesRecovery,flz0snn,t1_flxp0g5,1585613078.0,"You got this.  Even if you hate the idea of getting any exercise, just do a bit.  Breath and sweat. Maybe Epsom salt baths, magnesium helps. It may suck right now but you WILL get through this. The bad withdrawals are what has kept me from ever using again. Your body is healing and so is your brain. You just have to trust it's happening. And hang in there."
OpiatesRecovery,flx2clp,t3_frmi5p,1585573247.0,"You can do this and you are so worth it.  Just hang in there.  The first few weeks can be rough.  The insomnia, panic attacks, general malaise etc.  But your brain is and will heal if you just give it time.  Clonidine helped me in the first few months.  Along with healthy food, rest (I couldn't even really work out much, but did go for short daily walks b/c the dog insisted.)

With the COVID-19 pandemic these are very stressful times for everyone so just know you are not alone in feeling hopeless.  And using again will make this time even harder on you.  Love yourself, reach out in whatever ways you can. One day at a time. It's a cliche but it is true.  I'm almost off opiates one year and I feel so proud and better.  But it wasn't easy.  I just had knee surgery before the COVID really hit and I didn't even want a pain pill.  So I'm learning to live with discomfort and rest which isn't easy for me.  We all are in this together!   Sending you heaps of support."
Fitness,flvpi2r,t3_fr3mhl,1585529058.0,I hurt my knee on my indoor cycle due to cleats being too tight. Rather than try to push through the pain (it is bad tendonitis) I am actually resting and letting my knee heal.  That is a Fitness victory for me.
