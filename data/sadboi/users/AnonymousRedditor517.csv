Maybe heâ€™ll like minecraft, and LEGO games? Thereâ€™s also racing games like Forza Horizon, which do have an online feature but can be played in single player. 

Personally I wouldnâ€™t let him play any games that are for older ages like 16s or 18s, but it is up to you because it doesnâ€™t bother some parents whether kids play those games. (I mean, I started playing call of duty at 4 on my Nintendo. Probably wasnâ€™t the smartest choice my parents made though)"

But they also did kind of use some ideas from Endgame with the â€˜I am all the Sithâ€™ and the â€˜And I am all the Jediâ€™. They also used the â€˜on your leftâ€™ scene when Lando came with the fleet of ships. 

They could have made it better and more original if theyâ€™d come up with their own way for Lando to save them, for their own way to end palpatines  reign. 

In some aspects is was good but others disappointed."
