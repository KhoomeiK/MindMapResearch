bipolar,foq82r3,t1_fopg9sm,1587986276.0,I came here to say this. I had no idea this was part of hypo mania (makes so much sense though). I do this way too much and too often.

Also

Do you think it was helpful during your schooling years and it was good you were on it for those? 

Thanks for doing this AMA"

DecidingToBeBetter,fmg1s1q,t3_fuspgy,1586039467.0,"They have misnamed it. It is not social distancing it is physical distancing. This is a perfect time to reach out to others and strengthen/build relationships - and it gives you a great reason to engage! Initiate contact, say you are checking in, check in again a week later, ask what they are doing to keep busy, ask for movie recommendations, then watch the movie, and discuss it next time."

The 'score' isn't that important especially if you did something until it was hard. If it got hard, your body will benefit from it!"

Frugal,f3yyf3t,t3_diu82y,1571260896.0,"This isn't the healthiest approach because you are still consuming, but go to a thrift store and shop. You will likely spend much less and still fulfill the urge.

Alternatively if you just want new things because you are bored then peruse the library, especially in sections you don't normally go to (comics, cooking, comedy, biographies...) or order something youve never had at your fav coffee shop.

Also going through what you already own may remind you how much you already have and/or you may find things you forgot about that are 'new to you' for the second time."
