Im going to try and embrace hate. I hate working out but I feel so much better after. My mental health benefits from it immensely but I can‚Äôt make myself do it. I try to tell myself I‚Äôll feel better after but it doesn‚Äôt work so I‚Äôll try hate. Like you know what would suck? Going to the gym. Do it. You feel like shit anyway. Go hurt a little bit."

Advice,ev5jtjj,t3_cif0co,1564234863.0,"Go to your advisor at school. Go to the premed advisor if they are any good. They see this kind of dilemma all the time and can point you in the right direction. The premed advisor especially can advise which path to take because they understand the rigorous nature of Med school and residency. 

Also, there is no rush and no timetable for your career path. I decided to go into medicine a few years after graduating from college. I had to take a couple extra classes in graduate school but they also have certificate programs where you can take them all at once. My point is, you can always go back. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre making some irreversible decision right now.

So, you‚Äôve got options and you‚Äôve got time. Talk to an advisor. Take a semester to take different classes to explore what makes you tick! 

Best of luck!"
