Middle aged coworker: ""You make my day when you wear that top"".

20 year old woman: ""I won't wear it anymore then"".

MAC: ""oh I could help you take it off"".

20: laughs awkwardly.

As if that wasn't bad enough, this guy was looking at her chest most of while he said this and is bloody married.

I interrupted saying that is inappropriate and the look on my face must of registered with him because he made a crapy attempt to brush it off as a joke then left.
I told her she should complain about this stuff officially and put these assholes in their place but she just says that she's used to it. I don't know what makes me sadder, his behaviour or her being used to it to the point she just puts up with it.

I've been creeped on myself buy a coworker and some middle aged women before and it's not a nice feeling but because I'm a guy I didn't do anything except act awkward and stunned about it, thinking it wouldn't be taken seriously or just laughed off since I'm a guy and we all obviously want that stuff all the time/s.

I don't feel it's my place to report it for her, I don't even know if that would be taken seriously or if the company would accept it from someone that wasn't involved. Advice would be appreciated if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing."

I confronted her about it and she barely reacted, then later deflected any possibility that it was her doing when I flat out told her that I felt the way I did and gave a lot of examples when she asked for them. Soon after that I just stopped putting in the effort and never heard from her again, same with the rest of the circle of friends we shared.

It's been both freeing and a life lesson, but also felt really shity and made me question a lot of things at the time. I'm far less trusting these says.
