I was with the company for 6 years and went from 12.90hr to 45k salary, applying for other jobs in 3 months. I do probably 10% of the work Best Buy had me do. In this time of crisis really think about it! If you are in a position you are young and live at home and this is not going to cause you to be homeless or die. Just get out now! I put in a proper two weeks and still got tons of support and references from my team and management and landed a much better job. If you live at home with your parents or don’t need it. Just get out now and go home, get that resume up to date, get  on Linkdn, Robert Half, indeed, Monster and make actual accounts so people can find you! Many many people will hire Geeksquad agents and treat and pay you better. Hell the clients in my 6 years thought our job was chill and we made $21 an hour or something. Just go! Really, unless it’s life or death...which it kinda is. But I’m speaking on a money point. If you’re making 1,300 or less after taxes, benefits and been there for over a year just leave! Take some time for your own mental health and brush up that resume! You guys are all so much worth more than this!"
GeekSquad,fr3c1hz,t1_fr37dr6,1589854179.0,"Yeah I got in around late 2014 as a CIA with a pretty light work load for $10.50. Then as things changed to a 2 zone in 2016 or so got bumped to 12.50 for ARA. Still was ok, then had one yearly that year in 2016 added to equal out my 12.90hr. For 3 years I never had a real review or raise, and they really got me on that with the new metrics and reorganizing from the old CIA with a full staff of 5 people a day. 

We went down to 3 people a day, with just 6-7hrs of myself the full time ARA and 3 days a part time ARA for 5hrs. So work would stack and get crazy. Then came the reservation system which made it even more stressful with so little coverage...

Then the Apple roll out, which we were very understaffed for. At that point on average we had a opener CA, close CA and an ARA 5hrs 3 days a week and then me 7hrs 4 days a week. Things got very backlogged and I tried to do it. But for the pay and the lack of help and restructure I had to bounce. I was simply doing too much for little pay. Even in those 7hrs I was doing IPhones, 25-30 computers with reservations going over and helping the front, phones and long ass recaps, being called every day off to answer questions.

So you can see it just crashes. Most the entire team left but maybe 1 from when I started, and he works 6-14hrs month as a back up ARA. GSM took a new job as a double agent out of state, GM left, pretty much everyone left. Then all the young fresh blood there for a year, took their places and a lot of positions were rolled into one. My district manager was layed off as well, after 12 years with the company. Back of office and customer service lead was rolled into one. So I had no one to really go to at the top, that understood anymore. 

It was just time for me to get out. First 3 years were ok though for what it was. But just with everything I said the culture died and fell flat on its ass as well. You could tell it was now Best Buy tech support and GeekSquad was seen as just a retail associate. It was a very stressful job."
GeekSquad,fr340q2,t3_gjde2l,1589849496.0,"Gonna be honest. Usually when I worked as an ARA I come out and inspect. Run the built in calibration, checked for jams and broken pieces and that’s about it. Printers are not really serviceable and very disposable these days. You can buy a huge all in one that does everything for like $120 or a basic slim hp with scanner for $60 or so. I know some get upset that have old laser jet they payed $800-1k for from 2006. But those are not even serviceable and you can get one for $300 or so now. Try what you can, but even if a part is broken no luck finding the part and it would be too costly to repair. Hopefully it’s a paper jam and you can run the built in diag/recalb tools.

Also pro tip: with ink which is where the cost is pricey in the end. Look into a Cis ink system. You can get a printer and attach one to it without the ink drying out and having a expensive turn over. It stays in little plastic flasks and runs the ink through tubes. That way the ink doesn’t go bad, like in the propriety carts and can print black and white even if color is gone or low. I use one and it last a year on ink for very little."

The surgical and N/K 95 filtered masks are the ones that are difficult to get. They probably even be fine with a tshirt cut and tied. They don’t specify they need to be up to medical standards.

I bring a mask and hand sanitizer everywhere. But always keep a bandanna in the car as a back up covering.

I’m all for it! But it’s def going to be a weird year. Probably best to keep some bandannas around in case as a back up, if you run out or have to stop for some reason. I have a feeling surgical masks/non cloth, are going to surge even more in sales and hard to find more so the coming weeks."
Coronavirus,fqzs2nv,t1_fqyx0sf,1589774044.0,"Oh I know, I worked in a rural store for Geeksquad, for 5 years before and other misc low to medium wage jobs. 

Some people had a hard time understanding the policy of a business, that can make their own rules and reject a customers request if they want. Which is funny, because the same people preach No big government and for individual rights to the states. I’ve seen my fare share of people that are completely oblivious to the things around them. It’s those same people, that act like Karen’s and demand they are the center of the world. I use to get the line...”you know how much I spend here a year?” As if they didn’t shop there, the entire store would go into bankruptcy because of them. So yeah it’s humbling working those jobs and seeing the 7 out of 10 average customers being so entitled and clueless. 

But on the subject matter, I think the biggest issue is rural America. A lot of places have not been effected as much as others. These people just live in a bubble. They suffer from “until it happens to my family or friends” syndrome. I know some small counties that just got 15 and are freaking out. Everyone depending where they live, are in a little bubble. The same person in NYC, Washington,California, New Orleans is not going to fear as much, as some little place in Texas or Alabama outside the city. Thing is that makes up the mass majority of a lot of people. 

At this point it’s kind of everyone for themselves, depending how your area is handling it and if you’re forced back to work in unsafe questionable conditions. I just think everyone should at least wear a mask in a public building and practice safety. Stores and businesses are private and can indeed in force this. Which comes back to the beginning...they think it’s running over their freedom. No it’s what you voted for and stand for with private business and state decisions.

Coronavirus,fqrc2pq,t1_fqqdflp,1589581462.0,"You’re not wrong. A lot of office workers feel showing up early and staying later than their peers shows strength. However most offices about 4-5 hrs of work is done in that 8 hours of work a day. We just have this culture of being present and being hard on ourselves makes our work look better. Meanwhile if you look at say programmers and IT...A lot of them work in small groups of 3-8 and have offices all over they communicate by Skype to hold meetings. Most also have the option to work from home or relocate to the state the office is in. Now with some there are times you need 100-200 team that can communicate quickly in the same building. 

But a lot of work involving IT, spread sheets and confined work, as well as on call to fix something vs waiting in an office...Can easily be done on a salary. That’s another part. Hourly workers are incentive not just on the work, but physically being there. Most of the time it has nothing to do with work as they are hourly. In most cases it seems like a control issue, that things won’t get done unless in a 9-5 office. If they don’t do the work just get someone new...however that’s hard with not at will states and unemployment payouts. Someone could take advantage. I know Apple and some that do call center from home, have a camera on you to make sure you are at your home desk, besides lunch and have requirements to make it work.

However, most office jobs outside physical labor and huge development studios, can easily work from home and produce the same or better work. It also cuts down on leasing huge office space, and is a win for everyone.  But the idea of shift rotation is working well! My brother works sales for an oil company and since all this, he work Monday and Friday at the office. All the rest of the days is from home. You can def stagger it and still have a work force of half in the building and the other half at home doing swaps on days or weekly rotations. Probably be much better for mental health, child care and being productive."

I’ve been on both sides and lucky I’m working from home or in a small office setting. But from my experience working retail, it’s a lot of people on the daily, lots of work for a minimal sum.

To your point about a second wave. I heard someone say, how can we have a second wave when the first hasn’t even ended? Nor have we met the 14 day no case guidelines. Will they just keep pushing it regardless, and slow down on the numbers reported as it’s just what it is?"

Park is around the corner by Ralph’s restaurant. From my experience with Carrollton and side streets going up and down...it’s better to live on the furthest side, going towards bayou st.john, or at the end towards uptown garden district. So end of South carrollton or end of  North Carrollton is pretty decent and the adjacent streets.  

Apparently Washington, Tulane and the in between isn’t the best. I lived on corner of OAK and Adams in my youth and wouldn’t call it safe. Also Im pretty familiar with Tulane and it’s sketchy imo. But still some nice places, just not safe at night. I know people that live in gated high end apartments by Tulane and Washington area, but there is a lot of crime. 

What saved me a lot of hassle is using the Trulia App as it gives you the crime rates with a color coded map, statistics and general area. It was very helpful to find the area I wanted and then hunted!

Also since they have a  food and alcohol license they are pretty much bars. I feel it’s pretty shitty that bars with the same setups can’t open because they don’t serve food. Just in the same way Walmart can have a beauty parlor open doing ear piercings in non sterilized conditions...but a tattoo shop can’t take appointment only piercings. A lot of loopholes happening and businesses are taking advantage of this. 

My guess is the logic would be the same as 50 people in a park spread out that don’t know each other or came together. If they are gathering 5-8 people per table, at 6 ft away, is it a crowd of over 10 gathering illegally?  🤔"

It seems a lot of loopholes are happening, with non essential services being run out of essential service businesses. Seems a lot of things are an after thought, and not really planned well.

But even so in Covington it would be cheaper by $100-$200 than mandeville. Even Abita or some of the places by Walmart and Rouses down there. Mandeville is about 35 min away on the causeway, Covington given traffic is still about close to the same as I55 from Hammond area to Nola. But you really can’t go wrong in that area, as far as trying to navigate the crime,schools,price and issues compared with getting a place in Nola."
AskNOLA,fq8va2w,t3_gf17y2,1589176537.0,"I see you said for April 2022. Given all is well then. 

I’d say 3 days is pretty good. Even as a local I’ve lived outside the city an hour away before, and would do a local vacation. I book 3 days at a place in the quarter and just relax for the weekend. One thing was I barely ever would stay at the hotel as nights get late in Nola visiting. It’s good to plan a day trip time and a night trip. I’d probably spend the first two days on a day time schedule to check things out, rent a bike and have fun. 

Then on night 2 maybe do a night out and crash at 3am-5am, sleep and on day 3 just do the hungover brunch/hair of the dog and eat a lot of local food, maybe sit on the river. Then call it an early night for check out the next day. I think check out is 11/12 at most places. I know they extend at some places longer, given the night life.

Also I would skip Houston as one person said, and head to Austin. Austin is a lot funner and has its own unique culture like New Orleans or Portland would. Lots of cool music venues and beer places to check out. Houston is just a city, and not a lot to see imo. But Austin is kind of a hipster area. So if you’re looking to watch live music, craft beer and eat good food... it’s def a win over Houston."
AskNOLA,fq8u5fq,t1_fq2jal1,1589175606.0,"Haha as someone who was born and grew up on the Northshore this is pretty spot on. I live in Mid City now and just got away from Hammond,LA with a new job. I lived in Hammond because St.tammany mandeville/Covington where I grew up, was just corrupt and strived on putting people in jail. Plus it’s a very bland place to live. I suppose it’s ok if you have kids and want to shop a lot. Hammond,LA was cheaper on rent and less authoritarian so I lived out there for 12 years or so. Finally made it to mid city in a nice place, but rents not cheap for something nice that’s for sure. Still love it here though by bayou st.john/city park/mid city area.

When I visited Nola for fun and wanted to go all out from the northshore, as an adult. Usually me and my significant other at the time, would choose to get a place to stay overnight in Nola. The cops were just too much to travel back after a festival or night visit. You get pulled over for nothing, or being out past 10pm. They try to get you on anything and everything. The interstate 10 to I55 from Hammond to Nola, wasn’t as bad though compared to the causeway."
AskNOLA,fq8tf7w,t3_gglftg,1589175018.0,"I live in mid city and yeah the park is nice. I have a kayak and people are still doing that. But who knows what it’ll be like by July. I moved here in March by mid city/bayou St. John area and for outdoors it’s beautiful and great. But I’ve left my home probably 5 times in 2 months since I got here. Not much going on at all. Most activities are just people keeping to themselves for a stroll in the park, bike ride or a kayak on the bayou. Rental bikes are shut down for now as well as any rental type stuff for recreation. Might want to play it by ear and if you do come check ahead if you don’t have your own bike and kayak. Also restaurants are doing pick up. I know some other parishes started pick up and eat outside. No one knows if we’ll have a second lock down or what’s going to happen. But there’s really no tourist spots or rental places open as of now. I wanted a bike for my new place, and those places are still closed as well."
AskNOLA,fq8rgbl,t1_fq6f258,1589173451.0,"Yeah they’re right. I just moved in March here and I had 2 weeks to find a place. Most were priced between $950-1,200 in mid city. I saw some places that looked great in pictures, but had floors coming up and roach infested when I got there. Or nice places around bad areas. It took me awhile and ended up having to bump my budget to 1,200 to have central a/c, my cat and a good location. Pets and central AC tend to be a big deal on a place being $950 vs 1,200 here. But i had a realtor with me, and we still had to really look. Best place ended up being for lease by owner vs corporation leases I found. Also days on market and price drops were a dead giveaway it may be bad. Try Trulia App, as it gives crime statistics in the area, as well as typical accessibility to walk for things, parks and age brackets/safety and all that good stuff."
AskNOLA,fq8q35a,t1_fq5q5ly,1589172399.0,"Trulia as well! It shows crime and metrics of locations. I was able to find a nice place on N Carlton by Pandora’s snowballs for a lease by owner. My landlord lives next door and is really great with stuff. I couldn’t ask for a better place for myself. When I looked for mid city almost everything was 1,100 though in Febuary/March in the good areas. I ended up finding a nice house with 980 sqft one bedroom for 1,250 with central AC, water/trash included, pet allowed, low crime and great view/walk from everything. 

Also some nice places on the side streets sometimes going for 950-1k at 500-600sqft, no pet, window unit A/C if you’re lucky on timing. But overall anything at $800-$900 or so was kinda dumpy, needed renovation, window units and small on the space. I learned you def need to visit these places as some look good in pics, but end up in a bad location, need lots of work or are super small. Usually days on market plus price reductions I found, was a dead giveaway. Also pets seem to be a big deal with pricing. The trifecta was pets, central a/c, location for me. But not cheap."
GeekSquad,fq8obr1,t1_fpzn609,1589171055.0,That’s what my GSM did when I worked there before I left. On days he was there it ran pretty well as he functioned as a second ARA when we were really backed up and stressed. It’s really the only way we were able to keep things going. Props to you for helping your crew like that.
NewOrleans,fq8i37y,t3_ghanrd,1589166702.0,"$800 is very low. I know someone who found a place with water/electric and rent in mid city for $950 all included in a nice part. But that is a rare find and it is rather small at 550sqft or so. 

On average in mid city, my one bedroom but spacious and a house at around 980sqft on Carrollton by the park, is 1,250 a month with water included. When I looked most places were 1,100 and up. Even the smaller one bedrooms in not the best locations were 1,000. Anything $950 I saw was pretty run down or insanely small. A two bedroom was around 1,300 and up in most nice areas. That’s mostly in Orleans though in nice areas like mid city, uptown and bayou st.john. It’s really pretty where I’m at and low crime. Enough i feel safe on my porch, and walking late at night on my street. 

Maybe try Hammond,la 55 minutes away, as it’s an affordable college town. I just moved from there where rent was about that price, for a one-two bedroom. Maybe lake view or Metairie has something? I looked on the Trulia app as it gives you crime rates as well. But I lived in Hammond,La for a decade where average rent was $650-1k for a decent place. I commuted to the city 55 min a good bit, for night classes at Delgado and it wasn’t bad as far as hopping to the city!"
PSVR,fq5ce9u,t1_fpzahtn,1589100047.0,"When I first bought my psvr I felt everything was blurry. I tried some of the tips and they helped a little. But overall wasn’t satisfied. I actually went out and bought a PS4 pro just for VR, as I didn’t own a 4K till 2 years later. The games that supported the pro actually improved a good bit. Some games would still struggle in certain places. But the Pro in games the developers really took time with, looked way better I thought than my old ps4. 

The truth is if you want high quality you need to go with a high end PC rig. The blur is not going to go away with the current setup. I just caved and bought a pro in 2017 and it was good enough I didn’t feel the need to return either. I’ve owned both versions of the psvr, as well as the og ps4 and PS4 pro since day one. The og PS4 is blurry and some games are still blurry on the pro. But some games don’t look blurry on the pro if the developer patched it and took the time. Those are the facts. But if you expect clean high resolution game play then PC is the way to go. I was going to return my psvr originally, then when I bought the pro and tried early patched games like headmaster and rigs to see the difference....it  was a big enough difference I got rid of my og ps4. It made a huge difference with blur on “select” titles. Some still debate it a bit, but I was in the camp that the psvr on the base PS4, was just meh for the $399 I paid at the time and I was let down. But with the pro and as games got better, I’ve actually really enjoyed it. The pro met my expectations mid way as acceptable, while the PS4 base just didn’t tbh."

GeekSquad,fpv27v9,t3_geyxid,1588932227.0,"Before the lockdown I left in October 2019. We were very low staffed and I was the only full timer. I pretty much had to do so many jobs computers were not getting touched. It felt like being buried alive. I worked that way for 6/7 months before I folded. Luckily after a few months out I found a better job that took me from 19k-20k a year at the squad to 45k a year. I seriously was burned out and had been with the company almost 6 years up till then. So I can imagine you probably have double the load I already had as well now. At least it’s just 4 computers and not 30 I guess. I liked my job there the first few years. But as wages became laughable, my mental health declined and work load became out of control...I just got out and found a company that saw the worth in my work and skills more than Best Buy. I was paid and treated like a retail clerk, but I was always urgently needed on and off the clock. 

Be safe and wish you luck!"

It went insane, so much so I thought it was going to just die lol. But if the fan is spinning it doing its job to cool. Just means it’s being pushed to its potential and needs the extra cooling. If it’s doing it all the time on indie games, YouTube or something, then maybe a cleaning is needed. I’ve found mines louder if I leave a disc in, even if I’m playing a digital game as well."

If you are on Facebook , have a google account, Apple ID, Instagram ect. It’s already done. By signing up there is one extra step and that’s to say you are willing ti be alerted if someone you came in contact tested positive in the data base. On the same coin if you were positive you wouldn’t be named, but it would be alerted to those you came in contact with a tested positive. So their is that part, but it’s not a full disclosure to medical records or anything...just covoid cases and contact tracing. It’s an options sure, but the easiest way to do it. Honestly, if you just go to target buy something. You’ll notice your email flooded with target stuff. Hell if you even mention mental health or “key words” on your phone it’ll get advertise back. They place trackers on you from one site, and collect as you surf to gather a portfolio on you. That data is then sold off to companies. 

We are far past privacy and tracking if you didn’t know. Only way to opt out in general for everything, is to use a burner phone with no internet, and have no email while using an incognito browser or vpn on a computer."

Coronavirus,fpmjdaf,t3_ge51mp,1588734356.0,"No shit it will cause increase. I didn’t hear anything scandalous in the recording that’s not common sense. Now I do believe states with higher rates, may want to play it safer than somewhere with lower cases vs putting an arbitrary date on it. I think we can’t escape these facts and will have to get back to some “new” normalcy. However areas with high cases should wait a bit longer than other areas. As well as neighboring areas that have low rates but are just 25-45 min away from a high rate area.

I live in New Orleans Parish where we have a high rate. Most places outside us, are going to open up sooner. But as far as Orleans parish the local authorities are treating it different. It’ll probably be a bit longer with more daily precautions than a small parish an hour away already open up celebrating May 5th outside at restaurants. As far as what I can do where I live...since day one it’s been allowed for some small businesses to allow 10 people inside to order and pick up with a line of distancing outside. 

Most all restaurants in the area are doing take out curb side, parks have been open since day 1. Not much has changed outside 75% of businesses working from home. Necessities are being met for us. However people bitching about haircuts, going to a crowded bar I don’t understand. It sucks, but it’s just going to take awhile. My city is a tourist destination and a drinking partying free spirited city. But so far most locals are respecting it and things are going ok...outside being a bit stir crazy having limited options for entertainment and dine in eating."

Then it would be given to the secretary. No big deal there imo. But this sounds like super vigilant forced contact tracing with a poor idea. I think this would be better handled by an optional cell phone app. Some agree or disagree but I think in the same way traffic is handled by google maps. A discrete “by choice” log is a better easier opt in. Of course we know Apple and google are working on this and I think many will sign up wanting to know for personal reasons. However an old school sign in sheet, how the hell are they going to enforce that? I’m not signing anything. It really has no merit and sounds archaic as hell. Also I’m not pro opening early and on the caution of being safe. But this just sounds very very half assed."
OpiatesRecovery,fpf6j5u,t1_fpf59rf,1588562980.0,"Yeah it’s a very helpful med, but getting off it after being on at any dose for more than 2 months daily...comes with a pretty big punch of 25-30 days of symptoms, fatigue and insomnia. It’s not that it’s harsh, it’s just very slow. Also suboxone should be looked at better by doctors giving it to patients with anxiety/depression history. A LOT including myself after I got off for almost a year...started realizing it was acting as an antidepressant, even in small doses. So then you have to deal with that afterwards as well. It treats many issues, but also causes many issues getting off and or being at a higher dose than needed. A week on and taper is better suited for most with therapy. Long term use can be helpful, but if only recommend long term in low doses under 2mg and gradually tapering down as you get a hold of things. It’s a very good antidepressant come to find, even if you get over wanting to use opiates...but that’s something that needs to be addressed as you’re coming off or lowering your dose. Many make the mistake of getting off, going through all the hard work...only to end up off and in a state of severe depression and suicidal ideation after a pink cloud. It’s a strange med"

But for me it took awhile like month 8 or so before I felt a bit more normal. Best advise is to keep working out, eat healthy and really stay away from alcohol for a good while. I ended up with a bit of a drinking habit after I got off and even got back on at a small 0.25mg dose. Was weird because I never drank beer regularly before like that. I found living very clean, lots of sunlight, low stress the first few months and working out helps. I’ve considered jumping again myself since I’m stuck at home getting paid. But I feel the best I could do is clean my drinking up, get my dosage way down, skip days and work out more. I seriously want to start prepping myself.

Now if you are doing say an early morning or late run when people aren’t around and really staying away from people...you could probably say it’s still acceptable.

As of now I actually use to work for GeekSquad Best Buy...better job now. But they are still selling TVs well and have the theater department doing well from what I hear. We will probably see a big boom for more 4K/Oleds and even 8k with better surround at home being bought up and installed. Nothing really trumps the big movie experience. But with the tech now you can get pretty close to a nice experience in home these days. I know I’ll probably come fall invest in a better set up and make my home a bigger recreational area. I already started to put some arcade cabs in running on raspberry pis, and I’m thinking about getting a bigger OLEd 4K with Dolby vision support, as prices are coming down more. My years there I had many hobbies and discounts for home theater and gaming. Home entertainment will probably see a growth, as well as in home services to set them up in the coming future.

politics,fozra8p,t3_ga9jpd,1588195488.0,"Yep. While it’s nice to get 1,200 it’s about a months rent and maybe one utility for most outside poor rural and section 8 housing. They had to up the 938 dollars a month here to around 2,500 after taxes. So unemployment in my state is now at an average income of 40k a year per person. That’s about the average needed for the single person to live. Now if you are married,roommate or have a partner it’s a little different with two incomes....that’s how a lot have barely gotten by.  It those who are not coupled up sharing living costs 1,600 a month or less just isn’t but a half of what’s needed a month to pay for all living expenses. It’s pretty crazy imo. The normal average should be at minimum around 35k a year if we’re low balling of what it would minimally take to squeeze by on a single income alone. Inflation is real and wage stagnation is a big thing. 

In my life example I worked for 13hr barely getting by. I left that job and found a 40k-45k job right after leaving luckily. I now don’t have the every day feeling of dread to try and get by. I knew I was under valued and got very lucky looking else where with my skill set. I argued with that 13hr employer, and did so much over my 6 years. But to no avail did they feel i was even worth 15hr to retain me. Where as I went else where and my first offer was 42,500 with a 6 month up to 45k peer review vs 18k-21k. Huge difference there. Not many people are fortunate enough, but also don’t sell yourself short. You probably are getting payed lower than your worth if you are making 12-14 in an office setting with some type of skill set of 5 years or more still there. 

We now call this the disloyalty raise. Where instead of getting a 0.4% raise staying yearly you can earn 30% or more by changing jobs every 2 years. This has been a normal thing in the last 10 years for most in their late 20s/30s/40s. That’s just how it goes. I just did and a good friend of mine, did the same thing switched out companies going from 55k to 70k ...doing about the same if not less, as a “new” employee hire on. It’s highly recommend not to stay with the same company these days if you want to make more. 

With the exception you can move up laterally, which is rarely happening outside maybe small retail gigs from say cashier, to lead to manager. Which are still all very low wage points. An example of a retail model like that being 9hr, 14hr, 18hr. Then possibly a General Manager which is usually an out of state/store hire making 55k-70k that usually hold those positions for a very long time as tenors."
Tinder,foxb61p,t1_fox9qan,1588138818.0,"While I do get matches on Tinder payed or not. I notice not payed I get far more likes out of nowhere if I stay off long enough more than if I’m active. Like way way more than I should. Something is going on there. Maybe it’s bots, maybe they push your picture to the front. But I have noticed if you pay a month or 3,stop using the app it will surge really hard compared to normal use to draw you back in and wonder who are all these likes? It seems weird to me honestly. I know what I get regularly, and what I get when I disengage using the app and not pay anything....something seems off imo. 

I’ve noticed the pattern since I started using the app last year. I bet I will continue to get my normal amount of matches and likes, then once I stop paying after a week... it will surge in non visible likes x3 over to tempt me to rejoin the payed tier. I can’t be the only one that’s kept the same account paid a month here and there, then this happens?"
Coronavirus,fox99at,t1_fox7c84,1588137324.0,"Exactly what I worry about. Many won’t show up to begin with. There may be enough foot traffic for a few weeks out of protest, curiosity or letting people’s guard down. But once places open, it’s not the government’s responsibility anymore to help if it goes under and people stop showing up. If people don’t come, or we see a bigger spike while places continue to stay open...it’s going to cause many more businesses to be in over their head, with unemployment and debt on their dime not the governments. It’s a tricky situation and the quote you put up, sums it up well. I truly think many small shops will go under that have full time employees on the books. I know I won’t be doing unnecessary leisure shopping or services where I have to interact in a closed building at all, for awhile. 

Corporate America has found they can work from home, and also stagger employees with rotations from home to the work place. It’s already happening with some working 2 days at the office 3 at home. Some doing 1 week off 1 week home to split into groups. I think that will probably work out as they have a safety net to continue operating. But entertainment and leisure is going to have to adapt quickly. Whether that be in home services with protection gear, continuing take out meals or curbside models. I think these places need to figure out how to adapt rather than try to defy and think it’s all going back to normal. Movie theaters are in big trouble as I think we will see a shift to video on demand. AMC and some chains may go the way of blockbuster."

hingeapp,fowqle4,t1_forwvr3,1588125070.0,"Yes so much to this on every dating site. So many of these! It’s ok to throw in one or two. But some profiles it’s 10 pics of just working out, trips, dressy nights with friends in a very upscale place and holiday pics. The entire profile is just a big flex with no substance or the vulnerability of a real person."
hingeapp,fowq23b,t3_g97nz1,1588124763.0,"Women do all the same...especially with hiding kids till the last pic or in some weird way, group photos you have to go through because all of them are 2 girls and you don’t know which one you’re looking at. Also the angle shots for the first few photos hiding weight or photoshopped. Almost everything you said applies to girls as well. I wish there was some algorithm where they could all just be matched with each other lol

I wish people would just pick the first 3 pics that actually represents them the best. If all I see are pet,group and face pics only, it’s a no for me."
Bumble,fowl6oi,t1_foutdhh,1588121953.0,Too add... in options you can also turn on verified only. That way you only see verified people. I found that helps.
Bumble,fowkn55,t1_fovpoy1,1588121641.0,"True but there is hot crazy...she’s so hot why is she single? Could be recent break up, or she’s a raging black out alcoholic or something. Roll the dice and find out. I’ve experienced both in real life where a girl is insanely attractive, but is single due to behavioral stuff or just doesn’t commit much. It’s hard to really judge that just on looks for sure."
Bumble,fowk9dm,t1_fouukju,1588121423.0,"I’ve found it to be the case a lot on Tinder. Usually one pic or add me on xxxx platform is a red flag. Usually if they are really hot with very little info it can seem like a red flag. With Bumble I usually just choose verified matches in options, and avoid one pic and add me on instas. The verified option where you take a selfie, seems to weed out fakes ok enough. Not sure how reliable it is"
Coronavirus,fotulsh,t1_fot4fct,1588066684.0,"I’m faculty support for technology at a college. It’s a weird place to be in. While it’s a community college and it’s a company that employees me and gets paid by a contract/although I’m not a contract worker per say. It means that I’m getting paid to just stay at home. But if they decide to say not renew the contract for a year and then rerenew...then I’ll have to do something else I guess in the company. If the school opened back up the daycare and maybe a lab or two, I’ll still be able to go to work with no students. I’m primarily there as an audio/video technician for teachers. As long as any teachers or campus facilities open I’m fine. It’s not so much the students as it’s the teachers,labs,meetings and option to host live seminars from empty classes remotely. It has me a bit anxious, because I moved more than an hour away to be a mile away from the campus in March and got to work for 1 week. Still grateful to be paid, but I really wanna work or have something to do. 

Originally before the lock down, the plan was to keep the daycare open, labs with only 10 people spaced apart with about 10 of them, for those without access to tech or internet. If we go back to that, then it’ll just be a very slow summer/possibly slow fall. There are still services greatly needed not all students or teachers have. So until teachers are allowed back and the day care and some labs open...I have no idea what’s going to happen. May end up commuting a lot possibly for jobs I didn’t sign up for, an hour or so a day commute, but it’s better than nothing."
residentevil,fotq5ns,t1_fotk6ft,1588062178.0,"Only thing I could see fixing is the controls. Outside that I think it a great game.. I tried playing recently and I didn’t find the game so difficult, as I felt like I was battling against the movement. It wants to be linear on a path, but the aiming takes some getting use to for me at least compared to 5 and above."
residentevil,fotpowc,t3_g9i26h,1588061707.0,Recently tried to play it for the first time on the ps4...it still looked good and held up. But those controls took some getting use to. Just didn’t move like I would of thought in my head. But it was ground breaking for its time
residentevil,fotpgoa,t3_g9j1nu,1588061481.0,"I saw this! Originally they had it made as RE2. Capcom reached out to to them to offer them jobs. But ended up making this instead. Apparently designers on code Veronica are on this. The review I saw had good things to say. But says the ammo clips, some puzzles were insane, and a few things were annoying. But it’s pretty crazy to see the early RE2 remake footage these guys made before being approached by Capcom. They pretty much had to take a build of RE2 they made and redo it...this is the final product. I dunno, looks cool."
PS4,fopwjmm,t3_g8lud3,1587974523.0,Yeah I had a fuzzy screen issue and turned it off and on and went back to normal the other night. In the past it’s happened with my 4K and an update.
PS4,fopwgds,t3_g8pxhf,1587974433.0,I got a fuzzy screen the other night and my connection just dropped on chat. Def some ghost in the machine type stuff since the update...but nothing serious yet.
NewOrleans,fopovzr,t1_fopnfn4,1587967512.0,"No I got what you are saying...I was just pointing out that by the governments phase 1, and other states they are opening those places first. I completely agree they should be the last, and I could see private business with measures in place being more predictable and safer."
NewOrleans,fopmnz6,t1_fooyn4p,1587965662.0,"Which I find funny that those are the first to open in other states. Those kind of places are the first dangers you think of. I know my brother in Texas works Mon/Fri at the office, and mid week at home to stagger the amount of people inside and keep distancing. Something like that for private business sounds more reasonable than say retail where people can’t social distance at all or have staff rotations. If I went back to work we already have cubicles 6ft apart, could wear a mask and do rotations like my brother is doing in Texas. I was told with my work since it’s 0.7 miles away as I moved here for it...that I may just need to be awake during 7:30am-4pm and have a call system on my phone, that alerts me to dispatch out to work, otherwise stay home. I think gyms,bars and theaters is nuts. 

I could maybe maybe see restaurants cutting capacity or having only outside benches to dine on spaced out...but nail salons and theaters...I dunno seems like the last thing that should open(but I also understand some places are looking at it from a small business economic vs health debate) Lots of small town boutiques and bars are up in arms because they are on the verge of closing, and have not received any money they were promised. Otherwise most owners I talked to, would stay closed if they got a month or two bail out.

Honestly with my work being in mid city I don’t expect anything till possibly June. But I’m staying alert for mid May just in case, to work on a call to call basis from home to go out as needed."
television,fopgowr,t3_g8niml,1587961028.0,I wanna know about GetRight. Where is this man! We must know about Covoid19. I must know more.
Bumble,fop1bu2,t3_g8hl2l,1587950905.0,"I think that’s the proper thing. Honestly I’m on dating apps during this time with no expectations. I’m usually one to go out alone or with a friend in real life, find my social niche and go from there. But I just moved to a new city in March, started work and it’s a lot to deal with. However I realized that I won’t really be able to talk or meet new people for awhile in public. So I figured Bumble/Tinder would be a place to start to maybe get to know people in my area. Even if it doesn’t lead to much, I kind just want to not limit myself to the limits of just my home and try to be social in some way or another. 

 But as many pointed out, it’s probably a very stressful time for many with jobs and everything else coming out in emotions. Some people wanna keep it casual and talk and may jump on these apps that usually don’t like me. And some may withdraw or pause accounts till they are ready, and really society is ready. I think this was handled well between both of you."
NewOrleans,foo74s5,t3_g8coov,1587933803.0,"Oh, man I just moved here mid March, in a house on N.Carrollton by the park. My landlord has a nice canoe in my backyard, he left and said I can just take it out  anytime. I need to try and get out there one of these days."
Music,folrjvp,t3_g7zqcm,1587868801.0,Crazy he was posted about the weed. Sounds like Eddie was prob coked up out his mind doing that lol
Tinder,folonp8,t3_g7idfq,1587866878.0,"Damn, that’s pretty bland. I’m surprised a girl msg first. I’ve found the hard way if I get a match with a girl I really like...if I don’t say a thing in the first hour they unmatch me most of the time. Like tinder is my life and I’m just staring at it 24/7. 

I don’t get that? Maybe I’m doing something and just can’t chat right now, or just on different schedules, work ect. But I find that to be common. With the gold at least they like me, and then if I like them I can jump in and talk right at matching. 

But I hate one liners. Guy should have just at least asked some random trivia, and asked her about herself. I can’t stand yes or no...then just a blank of nothing to carry it. At least you have him a shot in the first few msgs🤷🏻‍♂️"
cringe,fol6n3o,t3_g7kpi4,1587855918.0,"The Greg guy is just making shit up...didn’t he have a show during the Obama years that was geared to millennials? Also seeing Kennedy on fox is just weird. 

Anyways my take...he was thinking out loud as stupid as it sounded and needs to take some communication classes. Possibly stick to the script, and stop just saying the first thing that comes to mind. I didn’t see him tell people to directly do it. But he suggested it out loud that they should study it, and people were so scared, because his base takes his words so serious...it could become an issue with a small percentage. So much that brands had to come out with a warning. 

He should of been honest, and just say he was thinking out loud, and it was stupid to go off script and do so. Not that it was sarcasm, I see no sarcasm. That’s my take

On one hand I look on my Facebook at right wing trying to defend him with a bunch of similar stuff, and then liberals going ape shit saying he directly told the public to do it. To me both extremes seem to be wrong. So I dunno, I just saw it for what it was. I think everyone needs to get out of their political bubble, and just see the reality of what comes out his mouth sometimes is just stupid. He’s kind of an idiot during these press conferences. But as president he needs to not do these things and stick to the script. People look to the president in a time of crisis. We can’t have someone just blurting out random stuff, and having no filter at all."
NewOrleans,foiqy20,t1_foilaac,1587794184.0,"Thanks for the info. I had some weather seal tape I used on the door by the fridge, where I think it’s happening and some extra packing tape to keep it sealed further. But next trip to the store or amazon online order I’m gonna do it. I wanna get it taken care if before we head into summer and it gets to be a big issue."
