You start topping up your alcohol consumption.. if your drinking hard liquor a bottle a day, you can get into a serious addiction. I wasn't drinking spirits I was having 8 cans of beer a day after work. On my days off I would start drinking as soon as I woke up... I also done alot of cocaine... First couple of weeks not drinking you feel so depressed. You feel so down.... But you notice soon  enough that the alcohol didn't help in the first place.... It's a hard cycle to break once your in it.
