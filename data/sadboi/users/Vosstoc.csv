- Clearly, if the word 'hope' feels at all damaging, your in need of finding grander foundations to further your prospects... Mental and physical foundations... Search for things that breed happiness, ANYTHING... And stick to them... Draw a line in the sand... 

Happiness isnt materialistic, love isnt sex... 

Understand things... Dont just know them...

- I promise... No fate is planned for you... You are your own, and you plan your own fate... Whoever is feeding/has fed you nihilistic backwash, and lied to you (inadvertently or not) about the purpose of life and your purpose within it, and left you with nihilistic forms of mental bedrock (nihilistic foundations), they're wrong...

The word purpose is an awful word as well...

Thats never a bad idea.

As for if she is younger. Or hell even if an adult. She had come to reddit anonymously in hopes of recieving complete advice. And my advice would be (if she hasnt already), certainly speak to your parents, as I stated, its not like you had hooked up with a guy at 16 and got pregnant, now you want an abortion (retrospect), no you were taken advantage of sexually at the age of 7, leaving you with a possible secondary sti infection, even if it was from a family friend or even your immediate family, this predator is not just taking advantage of children hes carrying potentially dangerous sti's, its very important to recieve the proper care and even more important to keep this predator away from children. I suppose if this family friend or family memeber has deeply apologized and no longer does such things since and dreads your every approach because of how ashamed they are, perhaps in your heart you would rather give them a second chance, but i find that isnt probably the case. 

If so, do specify. We are not aware of your age."

Dont just go around not caring for others when u speak to them lol, apply your average courtesy, empathy, benefits etc. when being around anybody, just as you would expect others to do for you, but in the way you apply these things, do so how YOU do it without resentment, THAT'S what you can not care about. Being YOU.

And yes the way you would treat yourself has EVERYTHING to do with how you think others should treat you. And if your socially cocooned, well your not building yourself much now are you (at least in a sense of putting anything physical into practice), now certainly take heed to the great advice left on this post for you, but seriously, dont take all interactions so seriously, relax, youll know which relationships are worth building and which just arent. But everything you enjoy, youll never learn how to really do these things better or certainly not best, without ever putting yourself out there to learn how.

But no more normal than a sneeze as a means to expell bacteria from your body. I wouldn't go to planned parenthood in this instance, its mostly inapplicable and in many ways even more belittling (from what ive heard), especially being you were only 7, talk to your boyfriend about maybe seeing a therapist, a GOOD, well adversed therapist who specializes in childhood trauma. There is absolutely NO weakness in doing so, perhaps one of the same gender would do you much better. But don't get a therapeutic referral from planned parenthood. Perhaps see your doctor again, even your normal practitioner and receive a referral from them. But be content, there are actually MANY treatment options when it comes to the infections you mentioned, but above everything always remember, YOU NEVER asked for it... So in all honesty, act like it, you are the victim, and yes, you never asked for that. And theres many reasons i say you should speak to you boyfriend about it first thing, but the biggest reason being, he needs to be aware of how much it takes a toll on you, because if it takes a toll on you, its detrimental to your relationship one way or another, and hearing his input is certainly going to give you assurance and company im sure. Perhaps you can even have a few sessions with your boyfriend there if you wish. For the long term however, therapy is never supposed to be a dread, even if your a little scared, going at it with courage and a pride to building yourself as a person and reaching fulfillment, is NO means to be afraid. That's only a reason to feel proud by tackling your fears.

So all best wishes, my heart is out to your mind and soul. 


Ps. As for why i wouldn't touch planned parenthood, their therapeutic referrals suck, perhaps if your tight on money, their sti treatments and check up are actually a great option...

Parents need to instill a yearn for truth, a reason WHY not to confuse love with pride, and MOST importantly, NOT TO BE A HOPE KILLER, teach empathy instead of apathy, all these words, ""why"", ""hope"", ""empathy"", ""wisdom"", ""intentions"", ""truth"", ""honesty"", THAT is what integrity is, and integrity is love... Love isnt just integrity, but integrity is necessary to have certain love. We need an agreed upon construct of good and evil ALSO using and agreed upom system of logic, and that, is called being empirical (i mean in very specific terms of empiricism, look that up, its what the bill of rights was basically founded upon lmao), one thing comes to another evil is certainly a valid participant nowadays, especially at the very top (the elites, the richest of the rich, the popular of the most popular), and they all feed off eachother... For context/example, evil is NOT what makes us miss someone after they pass away, but evil is the very thought that we may never see them again... Boom... Even BETTER said, evil, is why people die in the first place, why disease and decay is a thing, evil is what makes corperations greedy, there being evil is what makes people lie, cheat, steal, kill, and doing so with PRIDE, without consideration for others, which now, may force others to have to do those things in the name of preserving truth or life, and intentions can EASILY get misinterpreted sometimes, it sounds radical, BECAUSE IT IS, and its true, think about it, these tenancies of prideful narcissism, even crazier sadistic behaviors, it all had to root from someone sharing those attributes at some point, and then PROPAGATING this way of thinking... obviously, evil is where intentions are solely self absorbed with little empathy, but see, especially nowadays, **CONFUSION** is in the air, some just spreading blunt ass lies and they know it, the others pridefully spreading misinterpretations of that lie, and then many adopt THAT as the truth etc. etc. and then were just left with a sick cluster fuck of knowledge and people playing an exponential game of telephone coming from all types of media and adults and authority figures, and its throwing our moral compasses all over the damn place ALL THE TIME, and (inadvertently or not at this point) TRICKS us into thinking were always too busy to really think for ourselves cuz its less of a headache to just obey, and its keeping the proper knowledge from us to evolve our thought processes as a nation, because were not even asking the right questions yet, we gotta get there as a nation first, dont hear me wrong theres always a way to find the truth, no where near ALL people or coperations are evil, and there are plenty of good sources of news media (doesnt mean i might be a little cynical, but if u want the best rn id be going to fox for any current news, and anything else you wanna know, id go online and just keep digging until you found some mix of empirical and empathic perfection lmao) (empirical, basically just means the BEST ""why"" u can get, and a why is just the how of the how, dont let **anyone** tell u otherwise) 

See in a way, ALL sources of everything are good (even evil) if looking through the correct frame (being with the intent to one day do good with that information). AND PARENTS NEED TO TEACH THAT CORRECT FRAME. But nowadays in order to find the bare truth (which allows me to do things LIKE THIS), requires one to break all philanthropy and focus on emotional fulfillment, and focus on being empirical and applying intense empathy, analyzing the state of the world for what it is on ones own, and being a renegade, understanding all sides of the spectrum but still devoting to the right side of the line drawn in the sand, and nowadays, this is odly getting harder and harder and way too fucking to do without ever receiving heartache and societal consequences, its like there are systems in place built to lead us to heartache and broken promises whenever we do this and go against agenda, whether thats inadvertently or not, and im separating myself from any political spectrum right now, im not even confident enough to call myself an independent cuz theres many people (really the left) who would still just tell me to pick a damn side, so I always just say im for the truth, but i will say, our president now wouldve ran as an independent if he couldve (theres video proof out there), hes already doing the job for no salary, and paid for his own campaign entirely himself with no loans or asking anyone for help (in a way... doing it all himself apposed to, BEING LAZY and asking everyone else for money), but he just needed the party backing solely for EXPOSURE, but what does all that (politics) have anything to do with the topic of insults and roasting? 

BECAUSE PEOPLE DO IT THERE MORE THAN ANYWHERE, to the point they do what i do and hold people to some belief, not even a principle, a belief, and cant hold a friendship just because someone doesnt agree on some flimsy basis they said about something like climate change... Bruh i hold friendships with people who don't even know what the word integrity or principle means, let alone understand why it matters... And im paranoid af ALL THE TIME bc of it. And people have the audacity enough to jump to conclusions, never looking into every side of the spectrum, being BLINDED by pride, and then they go ahead teach thier children the very same thing, to never ask WHY anybody does anything that they do, for example, what does it mean to run as an independent, what REALLY drives someone to do such a thing, how does one prove their intentions in a world where people are always trying to manipulate them. Well step 1, it comes with being equipped with the proper moral compass. And yeah that comes from people like the ones on this subreddit, to not necessarily start taking the world by ""force"". But explaining and teaching the sciences of good to others like so.

So people can be of a **common content...**


THEN, and only then, can we move on as a nation, and yes a lot of it (okay most of it) has to do with understanding that you never really... ""die""... Because idk if anyone put the pieces together already but the major pride and self absorbed behavior, really roots from thinking they only have so much time alive... Or have some twisted versions of afterlife promise. And their just confused to the lies they were indoctrinated with. And dont get me wrong theres A LOT of occultic and organized evil out there yknow Satan worship (where they organize child rape and human trafficking) etc. but need i give any other examples or further explain?

When i say that last bolded section, im hardly even referring to reddit, the intended purpose of this very site has been holding true with a vengeance to Aaron for God sake, and all intended communities are THRIVING now with selfless behavior for the majority, but when i said that last bolded section, i was really speaking about the plethora of OTHER social platforms, where everyone is in a hunt for their share of a serotonin release. And take way too much pride in exposing what can honestly be cringy, self absorbed (possesive, materialistic, over sensative, etc.) behavior in the first place for all to openly judge lmao, it almost seems like thats why trends were created, to give everyone some sense of satisfaction in contributing to redundancy. And ik i might be over exaggerating a bit just because to the extent kids take it (or took it), is completely ranging and different to where you are, and your own particular peer culture; what year it is (or was) since things like snapchat and Instagram were created. But where I myself was (middle school of like 2010-2015), the posts you were associated with, followers, group chats, etc. played a HUGE role on your overall social status and it built a stigma around anybody who wasnt associated with these things, and/so if you werent, you were considered ""irrelevant"" (using that word exactly). And kids took that very seriously.

u/Nickki1 and u/AnonyH1, id like to build off both of you,

AnonyH1:
>You‚Äôre enlightened my son . **Human nature surely is evil**.

(not sure if that was directed to me but if so thank you very much, id like to consider myself a very spiritual person lol)

Nickki1:
>**I dont think its human nature personally...** **The issues are deep within society I think,** I blame the media and governments, and those in positions of great power, although I know that is a very unpopular opinion. I feel like the biggest flaw in humans is our collective cowardice. As the majority we can actually force change, we just don‚Äôt.


Theres a very beautiful common ground to be found here lol.

Getting to the grit yes, i wouldn't say human nature itself IS evil, evil just lives amongst humans in all of nature, by nature, read that a couple times itll make sense, but i wouldn't say human nature itself is corrupted, thats like looking from the eyes of some perfect AI for example lmao, and saying THAT, pretel is what drives these kids to do such degrading things, no, evil just exists, in all of nature, but regardless, kids only do what it is they are taught for the most part (keep reading i explain evil soon)... But the purity in questioning the reason for our existance can be proven by the fact that we wouldve questioned our purpose for existance innately/eventually no matter what, if we were just walking scripts, solely living for today without projecting our love and wishes into the future, or, in other words, hunting for emotional perfection, i wouldn't be making this comment rn, this post wouldnt even be a thing, reddit might not even be a thing, so for context, if that (questioning our purpose for existence) was a waste of time and the work of evil, well then i dont wanna know what good is, **right.** Parents are NOT teaching this to their kids, see if love just meant sex, and that alpha male beta simp or whatever that philosophy is was true (philanthopy in a nutshell), then yeah the only thing worth living for would be hunting for stutus and craving pride, cuz wed be living just to propagate...

I couldnt have said it better myself, theres a great comment vine here. Its not even like i hated it or i couldnt take a joke, tbh i might even say i took pride in being the one who always got people to laugh no matter the method, but over years and years of petty comments and silent sneak jabs since i was young, from elementary throughout middle school, to this day i NEVER have shit to say back, usually (even back then) ill just agree and play dumb to make them analyze their own intentions and principles but even still i was just always left to be the lightning rod. And yeah i let them for the most part, but its funny, it usually only happened when i was in a group. When i was with a friend one on one, things always went swimmingly... And just for living proof to build off of, yeah 18 years later (now) my ego turned out dented as shit, i spent YEARS building my intellect (for many reasons) but simultaneously building my own means of ""one-uppance"" thinking one day id use it to my advantage granted similar situations, and in the moment i STILL just shut down and end up giving it to them or crack under similar pressures. I was always led to plenty moral dilemmas at home too. Now I cant do anything without anxiety. 

Its hard for me to say it myself but yeah the
 reprecussions of this shit were honestly ridiculous. Im a head case now, im writing constantly like a deranged author trying not to forget anything, when i make music i have a mental block, i get caught up in day dreaming all the time which has me missing important direction leading to ridicule then i internalize that... Ive devoted my life to the truth and finding the answers that help EVERYONE, and believe me ive certainly helped plenty, and I have a beautiful girlfriend now, i have some good friends, but still, just because of my youth, it still shows a lot even with them. Im paranoid, I often feel misunderstood, im left with ridiculous moral standards i hold to people and I quietly assess them.

Believe me i HATE being the one who admitted he couldnt take the heat and build off of it and make myself better at standing up for myself.. But i was ALWAYS the all or nothing type, if i wasnt the best at it, there was no point, and if it was something i deemed wasnt worth being the best at, i said fuck it and took the high road, but all the degrading of my self worth honestly just made me waste my time by me constantly being in some  pointless theoretical rumination whenever i would make a public decision, or i should really say **theatrical** rumination, but tbh EVEN NOW, nothing i do ever feels like enough, i hardly ever post cuz i feel if im not bringing THE answer to the table or adding something of serious magnitute to the discussion, i feel im hunting for pointless ego boosting attention like the bulk of the crop nowadays, LET ALONE finding a point to putting the work in to a deep post if no ones gonna read it in the first place. I can't take pride in things like keep up work and school and people mistake it for laziness, dent my credibility further and you can see the slippery slope. But where my pride goes is just all too selective now because i deem it so precious, you might think all the shots at my ego would build thick skin, yeah, way too thick to the point idc what ANYNODY says, and if they dont agree with where im allowing my pride to go i discredit them and it can be unhealthy. (i was diagnosed with adhd a couple years ago btw)


I say all this to say, i think as a generation, its gonna take more parents who instill integrity before instant gratitude to limit ball busting just to ball busting, INSTEAD of brewing kids who resort to shitting on someones existance just because they did something that displeases their own insecurity  (WHATEVER that may be). And it really comes from parents who didn't raise their children with a culture and enough exposure to the rest of the world, and/or never chastised their child, either treating them far too spoiled or utterly neglecting them emotionally, which all just leads to the point it ONLY ends up placating that childs maturity which just limits their intellectual potential/capacity by the time their older. And yeah believe me during my youth id met PLENTY of kids who were nice and inviting and i felt comfortable in their presence opposed to the feeling i was doomed to some ego denting sarcastic situation. But some people just take enjoying their youth far too seriously and treat it like some competition, where being too nice is like some grand ultimatum thats somehow gonna lead them to a less fun and enticing youth mostly because THEIR not the center of attention whenever they want. And its really just a lack of instilling lasting principles as a child, and the lack of teaching why, not really ""accepting people"" is important no matter the people, but HELPING people, in the BEST way possible, is important no matter the people. And yeah please i grew up Italian throw in a ball buster its funny shit, it praises the little things and growing moments in someones life, but the world is WAY bigger than your lil ego cube, we build people back up afterwards, ALWAYS.

Truly, life is the ultimate example of love, just the fear and utter shame you placate within yourself of an ultimately cyclical complacent nature, is proof of this... as you are in a quest to understand love everyday...

And of course I already knew after my own research that‚Äôs what Id been said I thought I had the whole time during therapy, (I soon realized I knew pretty much my whole life it was just the fact my parents lead to me to think otherwise, and quite honestly I‚Äôm glad they did, I would do the same for my child), but I would‚Äôve been diagnosed far younger (like elementary) if my dad didn‚Äôt butt in, cuz he always scoffed at the idea just as he scoffs at pretty much anything that isn‚Äôt up to par with status quo, but I still see every pure intention behind it and appreciate it, cuz I wouldn‚Äôt have ever been on the same pace leading me to where I am now, presently, and i certainly never would have enjoyed having pills shoved down my throat at that age, but what‚Äôs even crazier, is I most likely never even would‚Äôve been diagnosed with adhd EVER, if it wasn‚Äôt for the original diagnosis of marijuana induced psychosis, and I had to get therapy... But I noticed even when symptoms presented themselves quite prominently ever since I was young, and even when I always knew I was different, my symptoms really started to change as my life changed, and they were usually always to an extreme whatever it was, like after I hit double digits a lot changed, after my friends abandoned me for the first time I changed, after I moved schools and yeah yaadaaa yaadaa, 

but just ever since I smoked that second time and got so high I thought I was gonna vomit choke on it and die and was left blank faced on a not REALLY friend‚Äôs couch and all my insecurity played like a tape in front of my face for the next 4 hours already regretted everything within the past 14 years- so you crazy? Ive lived a blip im so fucking glad I moved away-finally a new school where I can start over cuz after 8th grade Ive found out how to present myself kinda how I knew i actually wanted to be portrayed, I never wanted problems with anyone but still, never could have a friend unless it was a real one so there came high school, always thought with my ass so that blunt left me contemplating every angle of origin i can trace back i faced that tanked it terrified for the next month till I realized I needed closure, thought I was fine realized something else so then yeah I ran it back... died again now entegrity hidden pride wont let me lose so i just said i was fine and ran it back.... and died again... so by now I knew I knew I was fine- I died again and ran it back- and back and back and back and a lot more backs-until I finally realized... I was living a life that wasn‚Äôt even really mine in the first place... Now I can rhyme pretty well huh... got prescribed Adderall this year, last year had anti-psychotics anti-depressants lied said I was taken them I never did, at least for no longer than the first week... But oh no trust me it was even funnier when I went to therapy that one day 'month later and they said oh how much the meds were making such a big difference üòÇ yeah fuck out my face.... took me a year of nearly all flunken grades and summer school till now it‚Äôs just was on wax off Daniel son... almost straight A‚Äôs.... whenever wherever your lost, analyze your priorities, bottom line even throughout all this, I learned there‚Äôs a whole world out there... Faaarrr far beyond mine, but the one right in front of me is still... All mine... And this whole world is left for the taking of whatever it is I want... Especially if that want is a need to do myself justice (and that kinda pride is your biggest asset and beneficiary), cuz its integrity hidden...

(Okay now try to read this next part and not rhyme it lmao)

Okay sorry If that was too much, maybe it was too little I don‚Äôt know, but by how I personally was raised, my father was like the ultimate hope killer, a reality genius and narcissistic even tho he recently started calling me out for the same thing... yeah NOW I know better and can just laugh it off, but he often just comes out so right he‚Äôs wrong and he takes way too much pride in being the ultimate hope killer, and all because of some complex regarding the fact he‚Äôs a dentist and just because he can do something not everyone can he‚Äôs superior... I don‚Äôt even need to explain how false that philosophy is... And I see every end of it.... My mother has her own issues but she was and still is usually my savior, especially with all the drunken arguments my father throws at me often, it‚Äôs like he perplexes himself manipulating his insecurities to seem like strengths, I feel bad but I‚Äôd feel a lot worse if he wasn‚Äôt TOTALLY okay with it, can‚Äôt really blame him for that tho he‚Äôs 60... I can‚Äôt help it I kinda rhymed that too... And yeah there‚Äôs a couple angles in there... üôÉ

Bottom line my friend(s)...

-Therapy really only helps you understand societies standards and how to manipulate them, and I‚Äôve been doing it the past year, I promise... I still think you‚Äôd benefit from a diagnosis tho it helps a lot, you probably have almost exactly what I have adhd and some ocd.... which is honestly what I believe to be (using that word on purpose it‚Äôs only a theory) the actual basis of pretty much all mental disorders, adhd and ocd, and those are still just labels... at least all apart from maybe ptsd but that actually induces adhd and ocd tendency, but it makes a lot more sense when like 70 something % of all patients placed on amphetamine salts turn suddenly responsive and productive compared to anti anxiety drugs that these shrinks keep giving away like candy. Even crazier, there‚Äôs plenty of fruits with naturally occurring amphetamines, some even with nicotine too... Huh weed comes from the ground too... 

Let‚Äôs see what else...

-Life is the ultimate example of love

-The human vessel is corrupt 

-Too much of ANYTHING is not good for you or can kill you

-ANALYZE YOUR PRIORITIES 


Okay very important one...

-There might come times where you‚Äôll be left in a complete tunnel vision/depersonalization, just feeling completely empty of emotion, maybe lasting for even more than just one day but...

you WILL get past it, and come out where you wanna be, so long as you keep breathing üòå‚ù§Ô∏è

Sorry if I made u wanna rap lmao... I mean you CAN do it too if u really wanted but that all comes down to you... I have a feeling that may not be your call but I could be wrong, I could be very wrong....

Okay anyways It‚Äôs 1:11 in the am rn where I am, it took me about an hour to write this so appreciate it, lmao know I‚Äôm just kidding, it's all love Marque, i wish only the epitome of what's best for you, and please don‚Äôt feel afraid to reply with anything at all... And oh yeah read the Bible... And yeah I haven‚Äôt read all of it myself, and I‚Äôm not a Christian, eh technically I am.... But I don‚Äôt believe, I just know.... 

And that‚Äôs what I put my faith in... **What i know...** And the Bible happens to do a really good job at affirming that...
Almost a little too well...

and honestly to whomever should read this, you should pray tonight...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

And oh yeah just in case, I‚Äôm entirely sane (now)...

But r u? ‚ù§Ô∏èüôÉ



(edit: okay by **now** I made a few fixes and such cuz i saw ive neglected a few gramatical mistakes and errors so if you've read over this after the fact this comment's been posted youll find this whole mess hopefully reads much better and is up to my current standards lol)"

But back to the merit... I know how it feels to feel truly alone, and overanalyzing the contents of a relationship and feeling alienated by the rest of my peers and affirming the alienation by my own caretakers, and understanding my clingy annoying and blurty tendencies... Music felt like my only outlet often, often still is, that and writing (not really until high school), but nonstop writing, which I still do as well, which I‚Äôm sure your somewhat familiar in some sense, and I‚Äôm sure enjoying that one thing, where even if made to at school so long as there‚Äôs true point to the material and it‚Äôs meaningful, and it actually does you and your time justice, your still happy to do it... And I‚Äôm sure you've got your own fair share of mentally-organizational writing as well, idk maybe not, maybe u want to more but really don‚Äôt have the time, or energy, and/maybe because you really don‚Äôt exactly know what to look for or write down, I‚Äôm not precisely in your head, but I understand... you should see my notes app... Even with all the writing I‚Äôve done, I had never been able to actually take the time out to write my whole story, and post it... I almost did, a few times, but never actually went through with it, just out of the shame I felt when I found out I couldn‚Äôt do it all justice and still keep it succinct and enticing and ultimately empathetic... but you‚Äôve actually gone through with it... And truly I couldn‚Äôt have written it any better.... Which tells me one thing for certain, your feeling very lost and alone.... You've harnessed your writing focus on something tangible and multi purposeful in hopes that this **HAIL MARY** attempt, could so much as even allow a possibility, to the true, deep understanding I‚Äôm about to give you entirely... But mostly... really solely doing it for the organization of your own mind... as time begins to feels like it‚Äôs going by so much faster so you bully yourself in a sense to get this done to do yourself justice, mostly out of your own pride... and still dread the impending wait of uncertainty... But pride, is only an expectation you‚Äôve set for yourself, yeah that doesn‚Äôt necessarily make any pride good, but that certainly doesn‚Äôt make all pride bad, but u need to be weary of your pride, because it‚Äôs the root cause of your shame, as shame is only lost or forgotten pride, cuz in that same fear of the shame, and utter resentment you‚Äôd feel if you couldn‚Äôt do yourself justice in this writing, it's only furthering your notions of your researched AvPD tendency, and only giving you unconfirmed confirmation, same goes for truly every other disorder you‚Äôve listed, which obviously is only furthering your confusion and loneliness and will to isolate yourself all the more than you already would have naturally (granted your exposition)... To which affect, I don‚Äôt even think you know whether a diagnosis is what would TRULY allow you the closure you need anyways, or even whether that particular diagnosis is really ‚Äòtrue‚Äô (and I have a strong faith it‚Äôs not, at least the ones you‚Äôve highlighted, from what I‚Äôve seen, your mostly treating/characterizing disorders and associating what‚Äôs definite, with a search for like-tendencies in the same sense of a syndrome, not an intrinsically ultimate behavior that‚Äôs **terminally** cyclical, aka a disease or disorder), but you posted this for your own health, and I know any of that‚Äôs not necessarily what your tryna hear right now but honestly don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm getting there, but your doing this mostly just to prove your integrity hidden pride you can explain yourself, notice I said integrity hidden, because it‚Äôs your subconscious in hope you can at least organize some of your confusion, and possibly get a fulfilling answer from it whilst managing to prove your obvious intellectual property and yearn for empiricism and strong forethought, and how that‚Äôs presented itself throughout your life, whilst still managing to make it enticing and semi-viable, and acknowledgeable, and acknowledging your REAL audience cuz you know damn well something written at this length certainly isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs cup of tea and am I in the ballpark again? I was just surfing reddit for the first time in a while because of my being prescribed Adderall and the new habits I‚Äôve developed since this point of my life arose, mostly for the hell of it because Ive already been had a fair idea what I REALLY need to do to start getting back to some of my original self-care routines, but i just wanted to see if someone else truly had a similar dilemma that I could build off of, but of course shortly after searching I realized there‚Äôs not a snowballs chance when it really comes to me, so after realizing I was doing this mostly out of a search for some newfound motivation of course I ran off on some old tangents and eventually started writing something about marijuana on another reddit post, partially for the same reason you wrote this (to do your integrity justice), but mostly for the possibility of someone else‚Äôs benefit, because I remembered all the times where I searched and searched and the more I searched and didn‚Äôt truly find, the more alienated and alone I felt, and the more I wrote, the more I just came back stronger with new guns in my arsenal ready for the apocalypse... But see, then after I was pretty much done with this whole post about marijuana and anxiety, I realized that the question was posted almost a year ago, and nothing was really recent on the post, but I had already committed, I had already poured worthy lessons into it and certainly true essentials whilst remaining as ultimately empathetic as possible in the process of writing as necessary. So I decided I‚Äôd search for a more recent question to paste it on, one that was similar about paranoia and marijuana, marijuana induced anxiety attacks, episodes of impending doom and marijuana maybe even something about psychedelics idk, I was just trying to help as many people as possible etc. etc. I‚Äôm sure you understand in a few directions... Cuz that‚Äôs where I find you, and in my haste in writing this intro, I had accidentally copied something else to my clipboard and didn‚Äôt realize it... so about a half hour of work gone, that I could‚Äôve just rearranged the wording a bit to help you and many others in similar situations find fulfilling ultimatums but guess what.... it didn‚Äôt bother me at all... about a year ago I might‚Äôve thrown my I pad across the room but you know why it didn‚Äôt bother me? Because I know if it was that important, I‚Äôll cycle my way back around, and write it again, yeah sure maybe after some self loathing in disappointment, but afterwards I found I wrote it even better, and I still remember the times where I thought I would never even have the balls to go against status quo and fulfill the ego within myself because of my uncertainty and unpredictable/dysfunctional family, and Im not one to complain... Almost ever, right... And most of the time if I ever do, its almost narcissistically just to learn from a reaction... Many would say that‚Äôs traits of an empathic narcissist but ever since I can remember... All I knew was, if there was a spectrum that labeled consciousness and personality and existence etc.... Im on the extreme polar or scorching ends of whatever that spectrum is... I have too much love to give to this world and not enough people who understand... But one thing was always for certain... I know every question has a fulfilling answer, and there‚Äôs always something that came before, and after, cause and effect... And you can apply that to anything... And I‚Äôm sure your very familiar with this in some yearning sense... But you said you started smoking at the age of 12? I didn‚Äôt smoke until my freshman year of high school, I was almost 15 maybe just turned 15, then a year, now two later I‚Äôm 17, going on 71 lol... Obviously im being humbly sarcastic, but I know how it feels... But 12 years old... 12 is truly,  very young... just always keep that in mind... You were exposed to this level of contemplation so young you weren‚Äôt even necessarily equipped to handle all of the repercussions and juggle them with your priorities at the same time, and you‚Äôve become used to it... Because you were already overanalyzing how preoccupied you were, even before you first smoked in some sort of anxious context, but I‚Äôm sure you stayed and are still staying remotely strong, and i certainly known how that feels... I would never actually let petty win over empathy... and you know I can tell regardless of your family dynamic, you were raised by smart people..... Me too, I was raised as the only child, but not the spoiled one... The other one, my parents were never married, I‚Äôm off a condom, at least that‚Äôs what one parent said, little to no communication in the house it‚Äôs like I live with two people who I know only want the best for me but there both under entirely different (pretty much polar opposite) levels of secularity based societal standards and expectations, yet both still extremely rational people but one things for sure, my parents raised me right, even tho they didn‚Äôt often.... the absolutely did, but what your caretakers passed down to you from this point is what your using as your basis of logic right now, you need to separate yourself from standards in general to enjoy the royalties of solitude, and focus on what your good at and what you love instead of everything that leaves you lost and bottled and unsure of yourself, that doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt acknowledge these things, of course not that would be dangerous, but that means when you go about solving them, do it from a place of ultimate love... and yeah, ultimate empathy.... And by the grace of God I can write a whole book about love and empathy but yeah,"

So marque, from what I‚Äôm reading it really sounds like you are quite the special individual, so allow me to provide you with a bit of my own retrospect to start before I can get into any conclusions, but before anything, I want you to know, I can truly relate to how your feeling and what your currently going through, a lot actually, and sometimes you really need to dig down deep to feel good about the fact you aren‚Äôt alone... and of course our lives will have obvious contradiction somewhere but I‚Äôm going to shoot my greatest shot at doing this justice for you and matching your energy and intention, whilst giving you only the best most concise advice you‚Äôll need to hear in the process, so please bare with me, i will probably need to split this into a few parts.


Marque Im 17,  just turned a couple days ago, and I remember just a couple years ago when I was doing exactly what it appears your doing right now.... like right now.... At least what you‚Äôve been doing lately to my best assumption, which I‚Äôm sure consists a majority of; 

**going online and surfing every ocean the internet has to offer,** 

or at least the waves big enough to surf on; the ones that carry the real truth and answers (how to REALLY surf) and learn as **empirically** as you possibly can, and I‚Äôm sure you find those sandy beaches with high peak waves in really any way shape or form you can while you still have the time to do so... You might just feel entirely empty right now, or bottled, or dissociated, or some combination of everything but regardless... am i in the ballpark? Nonetheless there‚Äôs the problem that always lies within this dilemma. Time. It can feel extremely slow, it may feel as if no particular time has any particular subjective importance, yet time itself feels so undoubtedly important, so much so in a subconscious way, its ultimately paramount... Ask yourself if that‚Äôs something you would agree with... I‚Äôd like to think it is, but regardless I think you should focus on it a bit more... And all of this is no way shape or form a ‚Äúlil bro‚Äù or diss... The internet truly is a fantastic place, isn‚Äôt it... I found reddit was certainly a common destination when it came to broadening my perspective, and you could bet I certainly found a plenty of paths to fulfilling ultimatums and truth just by searching and going through some feeds, and just from searching online for anything in depth regarding my situation and things I wanted- well needed to know lest I would‚Äôve grown even more insecure, unproductive, civilly disobedient, etc. etc. yeah essentially just gone utterly awol...

But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve noticed marijuana, has a very intriguing and unpredictable nature. THC just has this variable capability of identifying the user‚Äôs most inner need/desire, and exploiting it by any means necessary. Whether it be buried subconsciously or not. Ultimately the endocrine system is very stimuli/environmentally dependent. And yeah when it comes to marijuana, truly, I‚Äôve seen every end of the spectrum regarding these capabilities... More than plenty absolutely anxiety inducing ego defying episodes, contemplating the bounds of my insecurity, just flooded by an heightened sense of some cyclical complacent nature overwhelmed by impending doom. Truly all induced by whatever current uncertainty is surrounding my life and current environment. Sarcastic senile thought loops, I‚Äôll be completely incoherent and my executive function is crippled, just completely washed over by anxiety, I‚Äôll have a hyper awareness of my lungs and swallowing, I‚Äôll be shivering and cold to the touch the whole 9... So much to a point i have zero desire to ever try a psychedelic in my life.

With this said, even still, no matter the ramifications it‚Äôs lead me to personally today (and by no means did I say bad ramifications), the craziest part is, all these experiences and reactions, **are entirely normal...** Chances are, anyone who smokes, to no matter what extent or rate, they will almost certainly have a ‚Äúbad experience‚Äù using marijuana at some point in their life, obviously so long as they smoke at different points in their life, and perhaps these ‚Äúbad experiences‚Äù are not always to that extent, but it‚Äôs all stimuli/environmentally dependent. Certainly dosage and strain dependent as well, but one thing‚Äôs for certain, the bad experience should NOT leave you purely ashamed and/or overcome by iniquity and ineptitude in any entirety, it may for a moment but after a little while no, it absolutely won't (which is why you continue smoking, ultimately it‚Äôs hope AND instantly gratifying)... So rather in fact, you should take it face value as your integrity, because all ‚Äúmarijuana induced‚Äù anxiety is... Is natural anxiety finding an outlet to escape, as it‚Äôs no longer suppressed by your innately, stimuli dependent endocrine... Essentially all this pent up emotion that lurks about when you smoke, and exponentially manifests afterwards, all that it means, is that your truly, truly caring about something... And have high aspirations for yourself... And see... EVERYBODY cares about something... You may see where I‚Äôm going with this... A person could have an archetype, personality, or have a particular environmental stimulus completely contradictory to that of another, yet both can have the very same ego defying experience on marijuana, just at different points within one another‚Äôs life, still most likely for a varying reason, but an utter contemplation of one‚Äôs uncertainty nonetheless. And possibly at the same point in time, yes, but at what time you smoke isn‚Äôt necessarily near as much of a benefactor as ones own environment, in fact (contrary to popular BELIEF, but rather being empirical), marijuana in this sense forced you to be critically analytical to your reality early, and allowed you to stop placating your anxiety at a very young age... And though, yes, smoking under the age of 25 is when experiences using marijuana have the highest chance of being truly anything but vapid and uneventful, and personally I can say beginning at the age of 12 is too young... However, anxiety is natural according to what you go home to everyday, even more specifically, what your current definition of home, is... All it did was force you to analyze your currency, and apply retro/introspection at a very young age... And THAT is how, and why, I particularly relate to you...

Because your not ‚Äòself-medicating‚Äô, your truly taking action based on to what you were exposed, and now smoking medicinally... Your being logical... To how much of that is empirically false logic based on the department of your caretakers expectation and environment I literally can‚Äôt be sure... But from personal experience at our age, granted our exposition, it was inevitability the very second thc first entered our brain... And if it wasn‚Äôt so, its ultimately just a game of the utter placation of your anxiety regardless... Now over the counter prescriptions and therapy can be drastically beneficial... but can also, truly, take months to do what marijuana can do in so much as...ONE day... (In this particular sense), to reach the same effect of finding the ‚Äúsubjective‚Äù benefactor to society, allow me to create a simple checklist regarding over the counter medication: It would take some minor but truly unnecessary liver and kidney diminishment, the prolonged and ultimately self-altering process of normalizing the feeling of dissociation and lethargy, and usually taking many MONTHS for over the counter (psychological) synthetics to accomplish their initial ‚Äúpurpose/goal‚Äù, which isn‚Äôt anywhere near what marijuana can do... In ONE day... How do I know this? I‚Äôm getting there but to those reading through the parental eye whom probably raised through a far less developed and consequential America are just gonna have to be patient... 

I will say, marijuana never killed brain cells, that‚Äôs been clinically disproven a long time ago. And I‚Äôm sure all those few iq points lost from an iq test within trails taken of those under the age of 25 who smoked marijuana, were simply out of the lack of a will to take an iq test, actually nothing under 10 iq points in the medical world is considered substantial evidence anyway... And I personally asked a few doctors from different departments about that.... But what we do know for certain, is marijuana actually helps build more efficient and intuitive neurological connections and does an even better job at fortifying them, and actually does a fantastic job at preventing even a high GENETIC predisposition to Alzheimer‚Äôs. But still, before you label me as some marijuana rights activist or that I‚Äôm of a belief it can ultimately ‚Äúcure‚Äù the world or something, please, I‚Äôm only providing to what I KNOW to be empirical and evidential... Because I already said, the age of 12 is far too young, not because it can kill you or anything of the sort, but marijuana is just far too unpredictable regarding a youths nervous state and the endocrines subjectivity, and a young mind of 12 years which is still not even in acknowledgement of the fact it‚Äôs still only gaining information to to be the best it can be, especially coming from a remotely unpredictable and/or dysfunctional household, and mixing the sudden imbalance of ones nervous tendencies and displacement of the very neurotransmitters behind this... Yes it‚Äôs a cause to receive a very possible undesirable effect. But even still, the blame is MOSLTY taken out of a plain societal inconvenience... And if I‚Äôm being honest, I know me myself (and very possibly you as well), began having these inclinations and precedents at a very young age (the idea of validating the understanding of our innate search for lessons, fullfillment, and the preceding/introspection of one‚Äôs own reality young), hence, possibly why we EVER felt morally validated and/or inclined to trying marijuana..."
