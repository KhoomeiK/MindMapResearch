depression,ewxbioq,t1_ewxazb0,1565851554.0,"Jesus man.. Jesus Christ man, what the fuck. Someone who's after a MASTER'S does not deserve that shit. My God.

Can you tell me about the crazy chick? All four of my girlfriends (ones I dated for like 2 weeks and cut off because of this) were nuts. Two had schizophrenia, one had BPD, and one had BPD and schizophrenia. What was it like dating that girl? Did she hit you? Scream, call you names? Look through your shit - pathological jealousy? BPD is a fucking behemoth of a mental disorder.

Also, if you don't mind asking, are you MGTOW/TRP? I'm not judging you, but I could totally understand someone going through ALL that ridiculous bullshit just giving up on dating. I thought all women were the same after my HS girlfriend accused me of rape."
depression,ewxa3g7,t1_ewx97ds,1565850160.0,"That's... I'm with you 100%. I may have been in relationships too long when I was too young, but... at least I got it out of the way. I got the experience of a relationship. I learned a lot about women and myself, I guess, even if it hurt me.

I meant just teenage frolicking and just fooling around and flirting, maybe casual dating... not fucking. I don't think I could ever hook up. But you are right, it's a horrible, shameful thing to do. If you read ""Scar Tissue"", Anthony talks about how all the groupie sex he had as a rockstar negatively impacted him and was very depressing to him in hindsight.

My best friend in high school told me he was jealous of our mutual friend having so much sex. I told him, well, I'm only dating one girl, and I have more sex than him, and we have a connection.

That period of singleness I regret so much - my first gf accused me of rape, which caused me to drop out 2nd semester 10th year, because I was hospitalized in a mental health facility. I spent the summer just fucking around and looking back, I'm ashamed of it. These were people, and I was just wanting their bodies. It disgusts me to this day how much of a hedonist I was. The drugs, suicide attempt, mom on her deathbed and everything just made me act like an asshole and I hate myself so much for doing that. It was so stupid. I've apologized to some of the girls.

If you don't mind, is there anything you can share about your relationships with women? I'm comforted by other people's stories. If you have time, of course."

I stop worrying about something, and then I worry about something else. Repeat ad nauseum."
depression,ew0hzk1,t1_ew0gzjm,1564989871.0,"Thank you so much.. you're right, if I keep fighting. something good MAY happen.. and it's worth finding out. My depression and anxiety have gotten much worse since my mother passed away, and watching her die nakedly, choling on vomit, seizing, EMT working her... my PTSD's consumed me.

I worked up the courage to see a therapist.. and am working on seeing a psychologist. I want to at least see if they work - as I haven't seen one, as my therapit I spent 3 years with tried to convert me to Christianity.

Is your depression better? Is it gone? If not, do you mind telling me your story?

Cheers from Midwest USA."
