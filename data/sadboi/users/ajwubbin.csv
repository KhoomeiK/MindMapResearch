Now, I do think communism can work on a very small scale. Most cults are communists. Families are essentially communist. But as soon as you get big enough that everyone doesn‚Äôt personally know the leader, it collapses.

There absolutely is a system of company where the masses choose who‚Äôs in charge. It‚Äôs called capitalism. People vote with their wallets. There have been plenty of companies that collapsed because of bad PR. And decentralizing power absolutely works. The American police system isn‚Äôt bad because it‚Äôs decentralized, in fact it‚Äôs not decentralized enough. The whole point of the National Guard in this country is so that in the event of civil unrest the troops are from the same state as the people. You‚Äôre a lot less likely to shoot an unarmed person from your hometown. Same thing applies to police, most incidents of police brutality are from officers of one part of town against people of another.

Slavery had been illegal in the northern states for quite a while, but as new states were added the federal government was deciding wether they would be slave or free states, which the South did not take kindly to, because they thought that soon the federal government would decide that they couldn‚Äôt be slave states either, which is why they seceded."

A lot of the time, a village would produce more than enough food to feed itself, only to have most of it taken by the government to trade for machinery or give to other areas, which often also went hungry because the food never got there. Barely anyone in the Chinese government died in the GLF famine. Don‚Äôt you think if they really hadn‚Äôt produced enough for the whole country the people who were thousands of miles away from the farms would‚Äôve been the first to go?

As for the Holodomor, it could not have happened if the government didn‚Äôt have control over the food supply. Dictators have appeared in nearly every communist country, because the system makes them damn near inevitable. Centralizing power is almost always a bad idea. 

Also, I don‚Äôt remember the German people starving by the millions under Hitler. Obviously Hitler was a terrible person, but mismanagement of resources was not an issue.

There is massively more starvation in socialist countries than in capitalist ones. The poverty rate in America is about 11%, so yes, most people are living comfortable lives. They might not have a lot saved up, but they can know they‚Äôre going to eat tomorrow and can afford pointless shit, which is a whole lot more than most socialist countries offer.

The lives of people living outside and arbitrary border are just as valuable as the lives of those inside it, but it‚Äôs not the responsibility of those inside the border to look after them.
