When my.mom was in her late 20's (I was around 8/9) she decided to date her step brother (my uncle). Things were great for a couple of months, until they broke up. Ever since they broke up (it's been around 15 years by now), my uncle has felt too uncomfortable to come to family holidays and my mom has felt too uncomfortable to come to family reunions for my grandpa's family. My grandma and grandpa went through a really hard time in their marriage because of it and our family has never been the same.

And for what it's worth, I (24F) slept with my entire family in the same bed (4 younger siblings, my mom, and our dog!) until I was 12/13.

I had my own room and my own bed but we often just ended up going to sleep in the same bed or room together anyway.. it was always comforting and fun, like a slumber party. I come from a pretty poor family and I was shocked to go to friends houses and realize they all sleep on their own every single night. I don't think it's strange to share a room with your sister.

Puppies are wild and can be overwhelming for the first 3 - 4 months at least. 

I've had my pup about 6 months now. I love him to pieces now but it was a nightmare until he was maybe 4.5 months. I had multiple breakdowns a week.

It might be worth looking into a dog that is already trained for emotional support purposes. OR adopting an older, well behaved dog who woU't have super high energy levels might make it easier to train if you're determined to train the dog yourself."

I wish he had walked out, but back then he was deep in the FOG. He actually thought I should value what they said about me because it was coming from a place of ""parental concern"". Thank goodness he's moved past that and is almost completely out of the fog by now. 

That's the hardest thing for me is knowing what they said about me and then having to see them. It's just going to be awkward and uncomfortable anyway so I don't see the point.

By realizing that they might have bipolar, they could utilize therapy resources located online or in books, which would help at least a little and could do no harm. It doesn't replace a professional diagnosis but if someone truly believes they are suffering but have not been able to get a professional diagnosis, I am not going to criticize that. They are clearly suffering with something and need help.

What I do mind is the people who say things like, ""the weather has been so bipolar today"", or ""I swear my period makes me bipolar Haha"".

bipolar,eqkeuww,t1_eqkefyj,1560121725.0,No drugs or alcohol. I do have one coffee in the morning but it's always the same and hasn't changed so I don't think that's it either. Thank you!
EDanonymemes,eqhdarq,t3_bydvum,1560055385.0,I LOVEEEE me some fig Newton's! They were one of my fave foods pre-ED. I don't eat them as often now that I know how many calories they have :(
EDAnonymous,eqhakby,t3_byeqbd,1560053166.0,My favorite scene is where he accidentally drinks full fat eggnog and knows the calorie count right off the top of his head. If that's not a Christmas mood then I don't know what is
EDAnonymous,eqebgfx,t3_by7l6l,1560001763.0,Sameeee. My bf leaves for 2 weeks every year for military training and I always use it as an excuse to fast and workout so I can drop some weight for when I see him next
EDAnonymous,epdjyys,t3_bu97ff,1559167757.0,"I take the majority of my meds at night, when I eat. I'm on seroquel which makes me INSANELY hungry, so it's best if I take it, eat shortly after, and then it knocks me out for the night before my meal can turn into a binge. I take my zoloft the same time as my seroquel, so I haven't ever noticed any weird stomach pains."
EDAnonymous,epdb2d8,t3_bu7u2j,1559163993.0,The thing I hate most about restricting is that I can't run like I used to :/
EDAnonymous,epd9nds,t3_buj364,1559163543.0,Ugh once I ate one of those jumbo cartons of goldfish crackers and my tastebuds were scraped off
EDAnonymous,epd9h9j,t3_buh3uu,1559163492.0,"My income is based a lot on tips so it varies, but I roughly make $1800 - $2200 USD a month. I actually don't spend too much on food or other ED related stuff unless I'm binging. I hope to earn as much as you once I graduate college! Congratulations!"
EDAnonymous,epd8tlt,t3_buewxf,1559163280.0,"I'm not a barista at starbucks, but I am at a busy family owned shop in my town! Honestly, it's easier to tell how disordered people are based on their food orders."
depressionregimens,eparrqt,t3_bu8qd1,1559132474.0,I was put on minocycline for YEARS for acne as a teenager. All it did was ruin my gums. I still suffered pretty severe depression (and acne lol). I'm not sure what my dose was though.
