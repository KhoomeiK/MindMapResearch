There’s definitely things that have happened for me to feel depressed about, but I’m not sure if that’s what I am feeling. I’ve lost three loved ones in the past two years, my parents hate each other, and I’m failing school again. Yet I don’t even seem to grasp it or really care. I don’t feel connected to anything-everything is floaty and empty. It seems as if my life is someone else’s game or movie or something and I’m stuck but also following along. I’m drifting. I go through an entire day but dont feel like it was me doing any of the talking or movement. I just don’t feel grounded. I know I’m not delusional, I don’t have split personalities or anything, I know that it is me -I just don’t connect to it. It doesn’t even make sense when I try to explain it. I really just feel as if I’m going to drift away. There’s no way to truly explain the feeling. Lost, I guess"
