leagueoflegends,fiqalj7,t1_fioky7e,1582639760.0,"People don't care? Riot doesn't care, same for worlds group stage, few bo1's to decide group stage with only 2 out of 4 teams advancing and without any lossr bracket is a joke. Only entertainment matter for them because it brings viewership."
vaporents,fi9ogqb,t3_f73nv1,1582274438.0,"I've never seen bubbler ""in mouthpiece"" before, just the ones that go straight into the chamber. Is it like a standard mouthpiece with sillicon ring? I'm asking because full glass bubblers take chamber space and make it even smaller, you have to pack weed in bubbler. If I could find this one in europe it would be great, I have Fenix Mini, also Fury rebrand, love it as my first vape."
leagueoflegends,fh3imjp,t1_fh3fktk,1581269340.0,"First of all, how long BT first item meta lasted compared to bf sword > zeal item > ie? Second, Soraka is a healer champion and she is supposed to heal. My point is that overall survivability has been buffed for every champion since runes reforged, and I think before that it was just fair to play more cautious as a mage or adc."
leagueoflegends,fh37srd,t3_f1986i,1581265857.0,"I remember the times when as an ADC I wouldn't get any lifesteal other than Dblade until 4th item. Now everything has healing, even mages. I love when low HP Ryze EQ's wave twice and he's good to go."

leagueoflegends,fadl3vn,t1_fadjx3r,1575977244.0,"He is not annoying, I just don't like the idea of ult stealing champion being a carry, not a support for example. When meta he becomes better version of some champions. Imo he should be situational to counter strong ult teamcomps, but not viable every game."

leagueoflegends,f5f9zj2,t1_f5f8txn,1572180088.0,"I think she wanted to improve by being confident in whatever she says, but when shes wrong or says ""kids"" all the time it just sounds stupid."
leagueoflegends,f5f9gjg,t1_f5f8vb1,1572179968.0,0 problems with Frosk after that ryze fiora 1v1 in the botlane? Worst casting trio honestly.
leagueoflegends,f5acoyb,t3_dnfepf,1572104974.0,"I can't stand the fact that the threw early lead like that, Broxah had all jungle camps from both sides for himself and knew where enemy jungler is. One lane Tian could go was botlane but Rekkles and Hyli decided to 2v2."

leagueoflegends,f3lbds2,t1_f3latty,1570974332.0,"Yeah I know but Im worried that despite CG having no tank, can FNC absorb all their damage and win? I think they know they are better and want other teams to start banning garen against them when they show up now."

leagueoflegends,f3fyjfx,t1_f3fxid0,1570904787.0,"Well I still think UOL was the strongest team that didn't make it. IIRC SPY won 4 out of 5 early games against them, but later.. people flamed them for having no idea how to close the game. I think if they focus on their mid game they have a good chance on making it out of this group. But still, we only saw 1 bo1 from every team so really hard to say."

These servers I suggested, warmane and netherwing, are good and didnt die, still many players, tauri has lower pop, but its probably best scripted pservers out there.

CoreJJ didn't show up in the group stage at all, TL lost both games against SKT and IG, if one bo5 doesnt make you the best support then guess what, Core had one good bo5 at msi."
leagueoflegends,eued4u2,t3_cg26lb,1563741388.0,On top of that I love when He is talking non stop about gameplay and answering questions while making plays and smurfing in high challenger. Today's fight for rank 2 with Jankos also very entertaining.

wowservers,eouw4uq,t1_eouo8id,1558882477.0,"I was surprised too because hd620 could handle gta5 in said resolution, but when I think about it now it might have something to do with RAM usage, since integrated gpu doesn't have it's own memory and uses systems and I think old WOW clients only use up to 4gbs it might be not enough(but still it should be imo), nelves starting zone is demanding with maximum draw distance. Maybe it's just bad optimisation, tbc is still really old, and with 7.3.5 engine classic will work well with your specs."
wowservers,eoulhr1,t3_bszooi,1558872651.0,"Few days ago I've installed tbc client on laptop with 7th gen i5(not much better than your i3), 8gb od ram and same integrated graphics. I've only checked max settings on 768p(native) and night elves starting zone was unplayable for me. I believe on low settings you will be fine, but You have to remember that performance will be lower if You have 1080p screen+classic is based on 7.3.5 legion client iirc which definielty has higher requirements than old 1.12 vanilla or tbc."
leagueoflegends,eo8qzuj,t3_bqx7du,1558372912.0,"Damage is annoying no doubt, but I think it is not the main problem, mana regen is. Support mages have weaknesses, they are squishy, but playing against brand/velkoz/lux is cancer because they can spam abilities every few seconds and if your support is playing defensive you can't do anything as and adc."
