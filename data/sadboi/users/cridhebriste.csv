Find someone you know and spend time with them connecting. 

The hardest part of my discovery day  was finding I had no one. No one. I was even shamed by my two closest family members that compared notes- but didn’t support me- I’ve never felt the same about anyone after that. 

I ended up walking around outside and a neighbor I knew saw me- he was a nurse and he took me in to sit me down because he recognized shock.

I am not negating that there’s some truth there however when you’ve been abused whether it be emotionally, physically, sexually,  financially, professionally, and or criminally-The damage does not go away -not ever. We just learn to accommodated - to work around it. So for people to minimize and invalidate your life experiences and tell you that you should be fine by now? Just  means they are clueless -they have not walked in your shoes and they truly don’t wanna hear about it- they don’t want it to be contagious- they don’t want it to happen to them. So they have to stay in their own little world feeling superior and safe and judging you. And sometimes they’re just bored and want to shut you up.

You can do these- they worked for me. 

Pick one of the words- one that is less intense than others. 

Write the word down on a piece of paper fold it up and carry it with you.  Put it in a pocket. Put a few alarms on your phone. When the alarm goes off- take it out and look at the word. 
You are in control of the word. 

Write the word over and over on a sheet of paper. Fill the sheet. UNLESS- you get bored writing the word. Either way- when done, crumble up the page and throw it away. You are in control of the word. 

Say the word yourself- out loud. Say it again and again. Say it ten times, then keep going to 20 or 30. You can use your phone to record it and then delete the recording. You can even look up the word and read the definition and synonyms out loud. The word has no control over you. 

You must force yourself. In increments. Just start and push a little then stop. Like building a muscle.

I had this with songs too. I would suddenly break down or leave when I heard one of many! So I chose one video and played the first few notes on my phone and stopped. A little longer the next time and stopped. Then the whole song. If I heard a song out with others - I would challenge myself to listen for a little while to see if being with others in a new place would overwrite the old memory.  Deep breath even hold a hand or hug someone. As long as I could and then stop. 

I felt proud of myself every time I tried- even if I failed. I tried again and now. A word or song or a place or an image on social media- my trigger me and I say- thank you brain- you are trying to protect me from a painful memory- you are doing your job. This word or song or memory will not stay- it will pass. I have gotten through others and I will get through this one too. 

Please try these at least. They freed me considerably from the booby traps of words, songs, movies, familiar places, social media images. and made those around me more comfortable too. 

Its like driving down a scary road. You go so far and then turn around or just stop. Then you calm down and drive a little further. A little more.

The feeling of pride and relief at the end of the road when you look back is amazing. And there after if you drive down the road again its not scary anymore."
