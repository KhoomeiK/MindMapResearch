lamictal,fjdqn4s,t3_fbte61,1583257353.0,"I've been on lamictal for about a month now (titrated from 25mg to 100mg daily). I am having a very good experience with it compared to SSRIs and SSNRIs. I have major depression. I have had no side effects and upon beginning the 100mg doseage, the physical symptoms of my depression began to lift. My mood has just started to lift. I am going to stay on 100mg for 2 weeks, then possibly increase to 150mg daily if needed. I am hopeful about this med as I have tried so many antidepressants."
lamictal,ffgzn89,t1_ffgyxpd,1579919187.0,Just here hoping for your vivid dreams if that is what you want!
mentalillness,ffgu6ab,t1_ffg9ulu,1579915149.0,It's my pleasure. I'm a Writer too. I pour my soul into it and it helps a lot too.
BPD,ffgskhs,t3_etbc5y,1579913973.0,"Yes! So vivid, lucid-like & super sexual too."
lamictal,ffgsg39,t1_ffgo065,1579913884.0,"I can't say the dream was pleasant or unpleasant but definitely very lucid. It was strange and so real.  It was like an interesting documentary, ha!"
Effexor,ffg9rhx,t3_etenok,1579901520.0,"I've never tried Buspar but am tapering off of 150mg Effexor and switching to Lamictal. I'm weirded out by the switch but I get the same flatlined emotions on SSRIs and Effexor. I'm not bipolar (have MDD, PTSD and GAD) so wondering how this will go. The research seems to be slim at best. Good luck to you, let us know how it goes!"
mentalillness,ffg8njr,t3_etfjx2,1579900836.0,"Let me just start by acknowledging your courage to reach out. Kudos to you as just doing this is a step in the right direction. It breaks my heart hearing about your struggles. Coming from an older woman with many years of experience with mental illness, the best thing I ever did for myself was get help. ""Help"" has come in many forms throughout the years. Sometimes calling a friend is all I needed. Sometimes getting out of my surroundings was enough. Sometimes I needed full psychiatric care including medication, group therapy and individual therapy. The most unfortunate and difficult part about mental illness, I have found, is finding the strength to fight for me and to get honest about everything. My advice to you is not to wait. Don't wait because  you are scared, don't wait because things are okay right now, don't wait because of this, that or the other thing. Put you first right now. You could maybe find just what you need and avoid several more years of full on suffering. You are so young, you have so many memories to make, learn the skills now so you can battle through the good and bad to come. I hope I don't sound pushy but I was your age when I started really struggling and so wish I was brave enough to get help then. Instead, I found coping in self-destructive ways and lost many years of life (and good friends) I will never get back."
EffexorSuccess,ffg6f3e,t3_et40yc,1579899454.0,"Alcohol & marijuana. The marijuana with Effexor seemed to increase my anxiety. Alcohol dulls the anxiety but heightens depression. Despite using both without major issues while on Effexor, overall the experience left  much to be desired."
mentalillness,ffg30rl,t3_eswj84,1579897364.0,Yes! Humor can be both an outlet and a mask. It usually comes from very dark places.
lamictal,ffg2c4b,t3_esn15s,1579896941.0,Can you get a new psychiatrist? The first thing mine mentioned about lamictal was the rash possibility!
lamictal,ffg23j9,t1_ff7hp5i,1579896794.0,I am having crazy dreams but could be from the Effexor as I'm still tapering off of it. I've also noticed I'm getting slightly less apathetic and glad for that!
Effexor,ffg1830,t3_etcyyw,1579896252.0,"Look into intermittent FMLA too. When I used to be a manager, I had a few staff on this. It protects your job while you are out of work intermittently. Talk to your doctor about it, then talk to HR before talking to your boss. It might be unpaid time, but if you have short term disability benefits, you could get paid depending on your plan/benefits. It could help when you need to take a day or two off every week!"
Effexor,few0pz3,t3_eqmfoz,1579403818.0,You should taper down under the care of a physician.
Effexor,febvt7u,t3_en2tma,1578963336.0,"It's definitely a discussion to have with your psychiatrist. I stopped taking celexa during my first pregnancy and experienced postpartum psychosis. It took months for me to get back on track with my mental health and restarting meds and I missed out on precious time with my baby. With my second pregnancy, I stayed on celexa and had perfect twin babies without the awful postpartum experience. As others have said, there is no concrete evidence that all antidepressants have a negative impact during pregnancy. Do talk to a psychiatrist about all of this, your OBGYN doesn't have the same level expertise."
Effexor,febtex6,t3_el4j4y,1578962499.0,I've been on Effexor for about a month and have had days of constipation followed by days of diarrhea. The constipation was the worst I have ever experienced though it seems to be getting a little better now. My food intake has also decreased because of it and possibly contributing to the lack of regular movements.
Effexor,febp1yv,t3_eo5pkg,1578961183.0,I actually started on 75mg and moved up to 150mg after 2 weeks. I haven't noticed a big difference other than feeling more tired than usual and my appetite has decreased. I'm seeing my psychiatrist in a week to see if I should stay on 150mg or not.
Effexor,fcvh14l,t3_eiun89,1578001919.0,I recently switched from 40 mg of celexa to 150 mg effexor. My psychiatrist made a point to tell me the mg dosage for the two drugs are not equivalent and should not be compared to one another. He did start me at 75mg for the first two weeks though before bumping up to 150mg.
mentalillness,fckaa5g,t3_ehkj6w,1577720734.0,"I'm surprised your psychiatrist didn't at least taper you off. When I was pregnant with my daughter, my doctor had me taper off of celexa over a 2-week period. There is also some evidence that certain SSRIs do not cause birth defects. Your doctor should talk to you about your options and risks involved. You could be at a higher risk of an unhealthy pregnancy if your mental health is suffering.

Effexor,famekbv,t3_e96hxk,1576201972.0,"I'm just about to start Effexor tomorrow at 75mg for 2 weeks, then up to 150mg. I've only been on SSRIs in my past and tried nearly all of them without much success. Really trying to hang on to some hope this might help, even if only for awhile. I also am trying xanax at 1mg for insomnia."
mentalillness,fakhc11,t1_faj5baz,1576167144.0,I have no access to psychedelics but that's an interesting suggestion.
disability,faikmgo,t3_e8bwpu,1576110136.0,Bonuses are often discretionary unless they are part of an employment contract. I receive a bonus every year unless my area of the company does not meet performance targets. Sometimes companies require you work a certain amount of time to qualify. It really varies by employer.
