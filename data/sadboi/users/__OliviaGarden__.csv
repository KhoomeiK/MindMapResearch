WritingPrompts,fq4vesn,t3_ggtjci,1589085083.0,"I was coming home from the doctor, absolutely distraught. I processed the words in my head over and over “I can’t find anything wrong with you”. Doctor Holloman made it quite clear I had no physical defects or injuries, so did the ambulance guys, but I couldn’t help looking down at the huge meat cleaver stabbed into my stomach. 

   And now, still with a large cleaver in my stomach, I’m walking across the city of downtown Austin, being treated with a nonchalant disregard. It’s 12:30AM, yet the city is alive. The slogan “Keep Austin Weird” has always held some truth, but the fact that zero people are acknowledging my “situation” is simply too strange. 

   Though it’s quite dark out, right? Never mind the blaring lights of the city. Maybe they just can’t see it? Or perhaps there was recently a horror convention, and my actively bleeding wound is no alarm. Of course, none of it would explain the doctors blatant disregard. I watched as she felt my stomach, her fingers even touching the blades handle, and nothing.

    It took a bit longer to reach my house with the whole actively bleeding thing, but I managed. I limped up those familiar cement steps to my apartment, right above our family owned sweets shop known as the Candy House. And also where my younger sister Madeline stabbed me a good 10 hours ago. Seemingly unprovoked, yelling about “the aliens”. 

But I don’t hate her for this, she’s been dealing with schizophrenia since she was 16. It’s been a year now, and I thought we finally found the right cocktail of medication. She’s less than a year younger than me, but she’s still my baby sister. I couldn’t hate her no matter what she did.

   I look under the vase for the key, but I can’t find it. In the vase, under the table by the door, in the wreath, but to no avail. Lucky for me, I get bored quite easily, and when you get bored easily you tend to learn some strange things like how to pick locks. So I get down on one knee and grab a few helpful little tools from my wallet, wincing as my wound scrunches up with my stomach. As I’m finishing it all up, I notice a little blue flashing light. A surveillance camera. We’ve never had one of those, but I can see why my parents would install one. We don’t live in the nicest neighborhood after all. 
   

I creak open the door to find everything the same. Madelines backpack and favorite shoes lay by the opening, so apparently she didn’t go running after my attempted murder. I walk towards my parents room, hoping they’ll notice my predicament. They didn’t seem to notice my screams and Madelines hysterics just 10 hours, and I haven’t seen them since. I texted them and called them a million times, but not a word. I can only hope Madeline didn’t have the same fate for them.

   I rustle In the kitchen cabinets, searching for some sort of first aid kit. I find it strange how the usual Jars of jelly beans are absent from their usual spot on the countertop. But before I can ponder this any longer, I’m met by the booming voice of my father.

   “WHO THE FUCK IS IN MY HOUSE” I dropped the first aid kit to the floor.
   “Dad! It’s me! Your son!” I yell pleadingly. Had his eyesight really gotten this bad?

   He stared at me with a rifle in his hands “I don’t have a son, you bastard! The hell you playin at!” It occurred to me then, had I walked into the wrong house? But the vase, Madeline’w shoes and backpack. It couldn’t be.

    “Dad, what are you talking about!?” I took one good look at my father. And that rifle, staring me right In eyes. I couldn’t help but feel that something was off. I think they call it the Uncanny Valley? His eyes were a bit too far apart, his skin a little too smooth. Perhaps I had walked into the wrong house.

   Dad, or whoever he was, kept shouting. “Don’t think you can trick me with your mind games, I used to be In the millitary you know! I could whoop your ass in seconds”

   Dad had not been in the military. I guessed I must’ve been in the wrong house after all. It must be the cleaver, I was getting loopy.

   “Ok, look” I said. “You’re right, this isn’t the right house. But if you haven’t noticed, I have a giant cleaver in my stomach, and I could really use some help, ok?” 

  His eyes widened for just a quick second. “A clea-?” But before I knew it he smiled a smile so so big and thin, his skin was ripping apart at the seams. “Ohh, I see” He said, staring behind me. I turned around to see something like my mother holding a frying pan. 

   “We’re gonna be so rich” my faux father said, and before I knew it, that frying pan was swinging towards me.



   I woke up in handcuffs. My eyes were swollen shut, but I knew I must’ve been in a moving vehicle. The back of a truck perhaps? I could feel the up and down of a bumpy road.

   I winced open my eyes, and after a bit, I could make out my fellow captors. An overcrowded truck filled of people I didn’t know but swore I could recognize. Among them my parents, both with kitchen knives puncturing their bodies. I tried to say something, but I was paralyzed, only my eyes being able to move.
   I looked up to the front of the truck. There driving the car was a young stranger, smiling a smile so wide his face was ripping at the seams"

If you’re not feeling pleasure, that’s nothing to fret over. I believe most women only feel pleasure when turned on, which is why people typically don’t feel pleasure at the gyno.

If you’re getting turned on at some point- try this. If you put a finger inside the vagina (finger print side up) and rub the top of the canal, search for a bump which feels similar to the bumps on the roof of your mouth. This is your skenes gland, more commonly known as the G spot. The gland will get swollen when turned on, and is an easy mechanism for orgasm.

Still not feeling pleasure? Well, either you don’t have a skenes gland, which while uncommon, isn’t unheard of. There are plenty of women who don’t have one. Or you’re dealing with some unrelated issues that probably has to do with a hormonal imbalance."
