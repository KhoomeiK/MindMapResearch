raisedbynarcissists,fon4d1x,t1_fomy63h,1587911947.0,"That's a good tip. I'm sort of scared of getting help, and I keep procrastinating because I partially believe I don't really need the help. It's very easy to have empathy for others, but I don't feel like I really deserve it. I need to be kinder to myself, I'm always told that, but I'm just more used to treating myself like my parents used to. Being kind to myself feels like I'm just spoiling myself for nothing and that I need to be tough on myself to get anything done in general."
raisedbynarcissists,fon44bp,t1_fomvufx,1587911787.0,Oh now I get it. It's a pain when your memory isn't working at its full capacity. My problem is that people around me meant something else with their words and now I have people that just mean what they say without any other hidden agenda. I get triggered when I hear similar phrases and I feel stuck like I used and I get very scared. Good tip though.
raisedbynarcissists,fomak7i,t1_folc5kn,1587883322.0,"That's correct. I feel bad for no contact with my parents because they had quite horrible childhood. I always wanted to fix them in that sense, I thought maybe if I show them the patterns they'll change their minds. My mom always excuses my dad because he was treated poorly and ""at least he didn't become a monster "". To me he was always one. 
I tried it 3 times. The first time I had no connection with the therapist, second was slightly better, 3rd time I went once and I started to gaslight myself by saying, ""it's not that bad. Why are you even doing this? It's a waste of time, you won't fix this."" I just get very scared to be very open with someone I think barely knows me and I feel like running away."

raisedbynarcissists,fol22ur,t1_fol14ah,1587853360.0,Kind of weird to do that with people around you. It's not very good to attack people. I have only done this with my parents as it's easier traceable. Thanks for the advice though.
raisedbynarcissists,fol0y0r,t1_fol0qtd,1587852725.0,"If the person tries to explain what they meant, because you're experiencing past trauma, does that count as not gaslighting?

And my dad said something like I get it that I fucked up your life for 24 years, but I don't get what I did in the last 2 years. I haven't called him for 1 year and a month now. As if you can say that like 24 years of abuse is nothing. Hey he should be given a cookie because he has been rather okish in the last 2 years. He hasn't, I only decreased communication him dramatically and have become financially independent that he can't harm me as much anymore. He didn't become nice because out his own goodwill, but because he was forced to be the minimum of decency. He still didn't respect my boundaries so I cut them off. Screw the unnecessary drama. Yuck."

While my problems are of the emotional kind, she just keeps referring to how much they built and how much they made financially. Don't get me wrong, that's the only positive aspect of my family, sheer determination, but they're emotionally inept. They could verbally abuse me and yet remind me that what they're saying isn't important, that I should brush it off, while at the same time think I'm not taking them seriously. A no win situation."
CPTSD,foepwg1,t3_g7046g,1587710805.0,"This reminded me of my first Christmas with my now husband. He and his family were very kind to me. I brought some gifts but I thought they weren't enough because everyone else brought so many. I felt bad, but back then, because we were in a long distance relationship, they all told me how it's a wonderful gift to have me there during holidays. I think it was the first time I was told I'm the most important gift and it made me cry a lot, because I was seen as such a burden for my whole life within my own family.
Every time I visited my parents I had to bring gifts otherwise they'd berate me and they'd never really enjoy my presence. They'd poke at me relentlessly until I broke down. 
I'm glad you have someone lovely in your life, it'll make you realize that you're not a burden, but that you matter as well."
raisedbynarcissists,fnvjjjc,t1_fnvjdaq,1587295671.0,"It's taboo to feel that about your family. Your sister acknowledges the bad parts but doesn't want to talk about it. She just wants to continue life as usual. It is painful to see it, but if you didn't you will continue the same line of abuse. She dismissed your abuse so you think it didn't happen. Trust yourself and what you experienced. You didn't make it up. Some people will excuse anything in the name of the family and pretend it's normal. It's not. You need to be loved and nurtured not to put up with abuse."
raisedbynarcissists,fnvj3qz,t3_g45v93,1587295225.0,Yes. You're engaging in a defense mechanism called denial. It helps to cope with a rather cruel reality while in the long run it won't fix the problem. Don't worry you're not losing it.

I was talking to a friend and she was complaining about how her parents were fighting are ruining her summer vacation. My dad thought it was me who was ""talking badly about them"". He got mad at me for a week without me knowing exactly why. My mom found out why he was mad at me. He misread the messages and he'd still blame me for it even though I kept explaining that it wasn't me who talked about them. I was too paralyzed to ever complain about them, even though they totally deserved it. He always wanted to make sure I never said a bad word about them to anyone and he'd punish me if I ever complained about his mistreatment towards me. I was naive then, but now I see how he disregarded my right to my own thoughts and feelings."
narcissisticparents,fnnuie8,t3_g2sqxb,1587102124.0,But this is pretty. And very moving too. Don't let her discourage you. You have a lot of talent and it's not her place to say anything about it.

ptsd,fnlh6mp,t1_fnlgjwl,1587053485.0,"Thanks. I don't think everybody can imagine it very well. It does eat at you alive as you have to do a whole lot of work just to be barely functional. And it feels like you're always behind socially because you couldn't develop a social circle of friends. 
Everything you said makes complete sense. I really wish it was easier than it is right now. It is very tiresome to just be in a hypervigilant state like you said. It's weird it just comes out of nowhere and seems to be like a neverending tornado. It mostly stops when I go to sleep but it's tiresome when I'm awake. Even though I managed quite a better life away from my family and I know I have a husband that loves me, it feels like it'd be fine to just not wake up one morning and leave it behind because I'm not making it any better. No matter what I do well, I can't see it unless I'm told. 
I hope you find the strength to pull through. It's a hell of a thing to battle."
ptsd,fnlc24q,t1_fnlb2a1,1587050882.0,"When you're in that much mental agony, the slightest inconvenience will set you off isn't it? It's difficult to function properly like that. I know I've tried anything I could. I might've not gone enough to the psychologist but the symptoms are just always there. 
I understand your pain and I wish I could help out. The only thing that sort of helps is sort of not trying to fight it sometimes, but it takes time and energy and that's not always easily available. It's painful I know. The only thing to do is to make sure that you're not alone in this and that there are many others struggling in a similar way. 
Sometimes when you think you're fine it's like your body can sense you're calm so it starts kicking you until you're down low again. I don't know about you, but I think with me it might have to do that my dad seriously wouldn't stop until he got under my skin and made me feel powerless. This happened for years. It could be something that makes you self destructive and unable to cope with it efficiently. I'm sad to hear about it. Hugs"
ptsd,fnlas8x,t3_g2g9kb,1587050226.0,I know how that's like. I think it's impossible to explain unless the other person feels it as well. It's horrible because nothing seems to stop it. Try to meditate and I only get more upset and dizzy. Like yeah stay with the feeling but it physically hurts too much to bear. Anxiety of that level is frustrating and you can't concentrate because of it anymore. Ugh
narcissisticparents,fn5sz8b,t1_fn5rlyh,1586674825.0,"I hope that works out for you. I can't physically stay next to them without getting a panic attack. I feel too unsafe to even talk to them one on one. It's because they're unstable emotionally and you never know how they'll react. 
I can't really forgive because to me that means I'd enable their actions. If I said I forgave them they'd expect me to behave as I did before, meek and silent. I have a lot of fear and anger to unpack and they don't want to listen to it."

You're not responsible for someone's amount of misery. It's horrible that she wasn't a bit more lucky, but you don't need to sacrifice your mental health for it. Always proceed carefully. I'm sure she knows if you care about her and can understand why you're making certain decisions due to circumstances."
narcissisticparents,fmz7u5z,t3_fy2iam,1586509829.0,"You deserve better than this. The relationship between your mom and grandmother doesn't sound very healthy to me. It reminds me of my mom's with her parents, she patched up things with her folks, but it's such a void and empty relationship that it's only there to make her look like the good, martyr type. Since the abuse rubbed off on you, they haven't fixed anything really. They'd want things to go well, but without effort. 
This situation is incredibly emotionally draining and damaging. You have to figure out a way to go back to no contact otherwise your mom will keep dragging you on this path and you sound very exhausted already. Don't fall into her games, nobody who really loves you talks to you that way. It sounds like you're some form of supply for her and nothing more. It doesn't sound like she really wants a relationship with you, but like she wants someone she can blame things on and since you're family, she wants the privilege of always mentioning she's your mom so she can get away with her behavior. You wouldn't let anyone like this in your life, blood family doesn't deserve it either. At the end of the day, it's more effort and pain than necessary, so it's not worth the cost, as you won't have a healthy relationship by the sound of it.
Take care of yourself first and foremost. This can be incredibly painful, but it'll be worth it in the end."

I simply have different needs than they do and they're so much in pain because we can't 100% agree on everything it became too toxic for me to bear it. My mom thinks and told me explicitly that there should be no boundaries between us and she got waloes all over because of that. She thinks that's openness. I can't deal with their lack of emotional intelligence, because they can only think how they feel and they dismiss others who are different in a second. It's just too tiresome."

That talking about how you feel can kill someone? If you were truly the victim in a situation you have to forgive and forget to not make them feel uncomfortable or to look in the mirror. I've tried many times to make my dad aware of his responsibility and usually he says ""but in the last 2 year I don't remember what I did so wrong. Everybody deserves a second chance. "" No, dad, you don't! You had thousands of chances and you fucked up every single time. To even call it a second chance is offensive to me, as he thinks I can be swooped by repetitive lines that have been said over and over. I ignore him now and I haven't called in over a year.

What you're saying makes perfect sense. I think there needs to be a balance and letting them slowly learn instead of criticizing them at every step. Some parents don't know how to do it properly. And their fear of letting you go is too big and can infringe on your growth a lot. 
I understand what you mean. That's pretty awful. I'm sorry your parents didn't care enough for you to take care of you. I don't understand how they could just turn a blind eye like that. You deserved better than that."
narcissisticparents,fmf3sf4,t1_fmf0lcm,1586019356.0,"I think it affects people differently. To discount one form of abuse because it's less bad than another one isn't the way to solving it. I'm sorry you had completely neglectful parents. I'm sure that was awful to live it. But just like you'd prefer some type of parents better, so do kids who are being controlled at every step wish to have distant parents. 
If is a big word there, because the moment I gained more autonomy my parents started getting panicked. They isolated me and I depended on them most of the time. A parent who completely makes their child dependent on them is abusive in a different way. Parents have a lot of power over the mental state of their kids, not everybody can just rebel. I wanted to leave my parents when I was a teenager but I knew that if they found me, I'd be in some serious shit. I could only rebel by thinking differently and taking away the power they have over me. My point is that some people don't dare to question their family and will obediently follow out of fear or habit. Each person has their own struggle to live with and you're just discounting one thing, because you also don't know how it is like to be powerless. Maybe I gave wrong examples when I mentioned cooking, but it was more concrete than what I could think of at that moment. The whole point was that some people don't learn basic life skills to deal with things because someone else does it for them the whole time and when they try to become independent it's either very hard or made impossible by circumstances."
narcissisticparents,fme2fa8,t3_fubv9f,1585986566.0,"I think it's because they use words in a way that's socially acceptable. So it sounds good, but it's not. Doing absolutely everything for your kid and leaving him either socially, intellectually inept is in it's own way a form of abuse. Never letting the kid grow independent and making him dependent on you so you can feel powerful as a parent is abusive, I think. It's nothing fun about someone who's in their 30's and can't even cook a meal for themselves because their mom did it all the time, or that you don't know how to do any household chores for the same reason. To teach your kid how to be a responsible adult is important and crucial, because if that kid grows up not being able to deal with anything without you as a parent, that's complete failure. Imagine if wildlife wouldn't teach their offsprings any skills or let them sometimes get hurt, they'd never learn how to fly or hunt and they'd die at the first sign of trouble."

I was never truly listened by my parents so I don't want to do it for that reason. I don't want to expose myself to pain in this way. I just want to be seen, and not shamed for how I feel. The feelings of heavy guilt, the horrible pain that feels like someone's putting knives through my whole body doesn't feel like it's worth it.

My mom was something to walk on for everybody, if she wasn't there at all I wouldn't notice either. She has no control over anyone, but because I've wasted my whole teenage years trying to get her out of her depression, talked to her constantly, lifted her up when I was supposed to find myself, now I have to compensate so much.

My husband respects me as a whole individual and I will not stand for a idiotic dad who can't get over himself. To live through someone else is selfish and cruel. It's one of the most awful you can do to your kids. There was a quote about it somewhere: The greatest burden a child must bear is the unlived life of its parents.. I was never allowed to be my full self. And if I tried there was hell to pay, I wasn't recognized anymore, I was only myself in their eyes if I did what they wanted me to do. My dad even said that as a family we need to laugh at the same things, to like the same things. If I had a different opinion on anything it was seen as if I was losing my mind and as if I was on a personal vendetta against him, when I only saw things differently than he did. He hated this a lot and he fought over it for many years.

narcissisticparents,flv3589,t1_flv2aep,1585515390.0,"My parents paid for my rent in university. I wanted to make it on my own, I did.  But I believed so much i couldn't get a job and even when i did it wasn't enough as the economy in my previous country is total shit. So very hard to get out of their grasp. And when they talk about me during university they keep making as if it was very difficult for me to be far away from them. It was in the first semester because they isolated me so badly i had very heightened social anxiety and they told they were the only friends I got. I believed them. I thought they wanted what's best for me but it doesn't add up at all. 
Wow, the crazy things they'd do to draw attention. I'm sorry you went through that. That's one of my biggest nightmares. My biggest luck is that I live in another country and they don't speak english and they don't know the address. It's like they don't want to see us grow because their confidence comes from being able to be the centre or our universe. My dad even told me once I had a nice time at a party in high school that he's jealous and he wanted me to be home for new year's eve. When I had a friend being sweet to me he was annoyed I never showered him with appreciation. I'm sick of him acting like a freaking victim when he's not. I was made to shut up my whole life and now he wants to completely shut down my voice because I have freedom and he can't stand it. One big reason why I'm not close to them as I'm afraid of what reactions that lunatic can have. And that my mom will always justify it with ""this is how he is."" That sorry excuse of a mom."

He's blaming this whole situation on me, including my distancing. And wants me to fix it. Even though he said he'd leave me alone numerous time, after me telling to leave me alone so many times I lost count, he won't give up the power over me. He likes to feel like he owns me and can't stand the thought of me having power over my own life. He wont admit it, but holy shit, he doesn't like someone as powerful as him in the same room. He wants me back to keep me meek, tiny and quiet as he did for 24 years. And as much as it hurts and as much I'm afraid, I won't let him have his way because that time is over. And the cycle ends with me. He does remind me every time that's he's my dad and deserves an answer. That a phonecall won't kill me, but it does, because I remember how awful I felt after talking to him. He also thinks my self protection is an act of revenge and that I hate him, when all I really want is to be left the f alone."
narcissisticparents,flv0bhu,t1_fluxyym,1585513736.0,My dad is 49 but he has been out of touch with reality for a long time. Ever since I went to university he doesn't like that I'm changing into a full grown adult. He says constantly he wants me to be independent but I swear he hates my guts for it. Because he wants me to be dependent on him for everything. The emotional abuse and blackmail has only gotten worse over time. He only really loved me as a tiny child who offered entertainment. He hates hearing me speak up or standing up for myself and will not stop telling me how cruel i am for speaking my mind over how I feel in his presence.

Especially if it's mostly to make them feel better. What some mean by I'll pray for you is that I hope you change back to how you were. Maybe you had different experiences with religious people but mine were abusive, especially coming from my family. My dad should learn how to respect boundaries first and foremost and not spout his religious nonsense on me. 
I never bother my family with my non belief for my own safety. But they always have to make their own beliefs heard while I have to shut down so I don't create conflict.

It's not genuine. Just give it time and you'll see it's only pressure to come back. They'll deny it of course, but it's pretty clear. It's quite vague and doesn't seem to also want to change. Mostly to have apologies accepted from you so they can keep doing the same. Because they don't like feeling shame or guilt for what they did for too long."

You know what she said instead of thanks for trying to help me? She started crying and telling me I think she's good for nothing, that I think she's dumb, that I don't appreciate her.

My parents are very young. My dad is 49 and my dad is 48. They had me very young, around 21. I'm glad your mom is sick. I hope you get to sigh of relief. Unless some miracle happens, I'll have to deal this for the rest of my youth."

My parents act like I'm the crazy one they can't reason with when they're supposed to be in a mental hospital. I'm tired of life. 
They're coming at me from all angles because they know how I function and how this crushes me. They let me Breathe for a while then they kick me in the gut again. Horrible people and there's nothing to be done than for me to be the bad guy"

You have no clue what micromanagement does to someone. Grown up adults need to at least be given a sense of freedom. Paying for someone's education doesn't mean you can control them the whole time. Many times parents freak out when they're not replied to immediately. Maybe this person has underlying issues you don't know much about. I only know I got financially supported and I was still emotionally abused and only when I moved out and cut my parents off could I have less panic attacks. 
If a mom wants to only check in they don't say stuff like maybe my daughter got into prostitution. That's absurd. It's lack of communication. And maybe the daughter in this case can't communicate as she's always shut down. Have you thought of that?"

I was 23 at that time. Even very recently she gave that example and said: it might not be right but that's how I feel. I love you. 
Like hello, someone can't physically reply and still she gets pissed off at you. Fuck that. They're just manipulative.

If they let me be at the right time or if I trusted them, this wouldn't happen. But it is a burden to talk to someone who is constantly concerned. My mom has depression because she chose to still stay in a toxic environment. She destroyed her life and she has no friends. 
Again, it's either about respecting boundaries or getting out. Being desperate throws everyone off. It's frustrating as fuck to be treated as a child when you're almost 30. Don't excuse it."

When I finished my master's degree with a 10, he congratulated me and seemed to have been happy for a few minutes. Then he told me: you should buy your boyfriend a beer.
