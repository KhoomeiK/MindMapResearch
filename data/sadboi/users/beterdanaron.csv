mentalhealth,fm8v4e4,t1_fm823ih,1585856594.0,"Your suffering doesn't mean people with mental illnesses suffer any less and people with mental illnesses ranting on this subreddit doesn't mean that they think you don't suffer. 

I don't get why you're even on this subreddit to begin with given your views on mental health. Don't come on this subreddit just to kick people while they're down please."
mentalhealth,fm7dgjk,t1_fm756bb,1585822791.0,"You really think people are killing themselves just because they can't hang out with their friends? 

Well you clearly don't understand what mental illness is and how much pain it can cause. People dealing with mental illness are suffering in these times especially when in isolation because they NEED a support system to deal with the things going on in their own heads. 
Not because they want to see their friends but because they need support and help. 

I mean don't get me wrong people dying because of the lack of resources is fucking horrible. But don't dismiss people with mental illness just because you don't understand the pain they're in."

depression,f5c74tq,t3_dnjazp,1572131109.0,"Definitely know how you feel, I feel so many emotions but have learned to turn them inwards instead of expressing them as a defensive mechanism. This resulted in me not being able to cry, not being able to get mad at people even though I am frustrated and irritated half of the time and worst of all it made me isolate myself because I can't express how I feel and I never learned to accept love and hell from the people around me.

This is what I think has caused it for me and a little rant about why it is the fucking worst. Maybe you can relate?"
depression,f5c5ze5,t3_dnk8h8,1572130726.0,"Wow this was actually me

Suicidal > crushing

Horny depression > new to relationship

Super Horny > using relationshit to distract myself from my mental health

Angry > break up

Pissed of > mad but still being able to channel that energy into useful things because i believed i was a new person after ending the relationship

And back to severely depressed > realising that after semi getting over this guy and semi moving on that I am still the same low self esteem broken person and still have shit mental health if not worse.

Thanks for listening to my ted talk making this all about me, my point is I feel you OP."
depression,f57vf7l,t3_cml6ni,1572043870.0,"I think my usual hypersomnia will turn into insomnia for a day. It's midnight and I have to work in a few hours, with people who know I am depressed even though I did not tell them and don't feel comfortable with them knowing so that will be fun :). 

Also i found out yesterday that I might have been sexually abused as a kid and that would make sense because of how damaged I am. I just started thinking about ot now and it makes me feel really uncomfortable.

I just talk so much in my head about how I feel and I just need to express and feel my emotions but it seems like the harder I try the worse it gets.

There are a million other things floating around in my head that I would like to write about but these are the first ones that came to mind."

depression,f2thvpc,t3_de421i,1570395470.0,"My parents made me feel like I was not good enough as myself and didn't give me the love I needed, which doesn't sound like much but I'm extremely sensitive. They also taught me their unhealthy patterns and now I'm stuck in these patterns.

I have a really low self esteem and social anxiety since I was like 9 or 10 and this has been going on for so long that it just kinda made me feel numb.

I  have had a lot bad days since then and definitely had seasonal depression. However I'm not quite sure I met the 'criteria' of being depressed until this year. When I finally split with my on and off ex and my classmate committed suicide (this was at the same time)."

depression,f0pbk4l,t3_cml6ni,1568831298.0,"Was finally able to cry today, so that is actually nice. but I don't know how to move on from the crying. I don't want life to go on like this but I'm also scared to die. 

I go through the same cycle of obsessive thoughts about my mental state and ex and still convince myself that I made up how I feel  or am somehow overexaggerating how I feel.

I haven't been diagnosed yet and am on a waiting list for some real help. But it feels like its taking forever.

If you read this thanks for taking the time and I hope you're having at least an okay day :)"
