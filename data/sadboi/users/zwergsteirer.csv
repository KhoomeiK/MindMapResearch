unpopularopinion,eux21wm,t3_choare,1564082329.0,"I agree, but I want to add something to that. 

If you have kids and you just raise them to be normal adults, your don't owe them anything.

BUT, like my parents and I love them with all my heart for this, when they help you more than anything to reach certain goals and they are happy when they see you succee, when they open you doors that you alone wouldn't ever be able to, you owe them at least something, your time, your help, your love. At a certain point it's not about taking anymore because they are your parents and they need to, it is about giving back for everything they do for you which is more than they would ever need to."

depression,etomnfo,t1_etolbyi,1563031966.0,I would really recommend it. I don't know where I would be without mine. There is a lot shit to deal with but there is someone who finally understands all your struggles completely and can help you. She is giving me hope that it will be better someday
depression,etok9a2,t3_ccpd32,1563030062.0,"It's just the same for me. The most painful thing is to realise it. Thinking that you are not good enough for them. You can really see how the people can handle your change because of depression. Some of them still stick around like there is nothing, some of them get kinda confused or hurt."

AnxietyDepression,es0stx8,t3_c5awl7,1561482366.0,"Sounds like me a few years ago. I was at my worst state with my anxiety, I wasn't able to leave the house anymore, when I did anxiety hit me so hard, that I ended up with an panic attack, crying like I somebody was about to kill me. 

It will get better, it's just, that you need to learn to deal with, you have to overcome your fears and just want to have a normal life again. It takes a lot to not run away anymore, to breath, maybe take some meds to calm down and just like sit it out. To be honest, at that stage it was impossible to get back on track just by myself, I know everyone is saying that again and again, but a good doctor/thearpist can safe your life."

Anxiety,erzzo5a,t3_c54ewx,1561460036.0,"This is the special side effect of mental illness. I am shaking 24/7, depending on how heavy my mind is at the moment. When I saw my doctor he noticed that, I was shaking heavily at that moment, even tho I only notive it anymore, when it is really heavy. It was a clear sign of all the stress. 

The thing is: I really hate it, because people are noticing it and I hate it so much, when they call me out because of it."
Anxiety,erzzif1,t3_c555z9,1561459831.0,"That's exactly what I think about myself as well. I feel so much hate towards myself, not good enough for anybody that I push them away, not even wanting to. Getting over that feeling is a fucking hard work, but the thing is, in all your struggle you just can't see the people carying for you. People who really try to get to you, I even slowly realize that I hurt people with that behavior, thanks to my best friend who always slaps me the reality in my face! Even though I feel like total crap because of it. 

Don't fortget that this bullshit of sickness is telling you all the lies. It's hard to see thr truth, I know, I am also struggeling heavily. You are not a waste of air! Instead of fighting yourself try to fight what tells you all these lies."

Well, I even think that after a diagnosis with depression and anxiety, takings meds and my making my doctor really worrying. 

Don't let that thought stop you from getting help, please. It's kinda like your head telling you, you are not even worth a really sickness. The thought of wanting to die is more than enough to seek help!"

And don't let you stop on your way! I didn't see the comments on that post but I am always happy when people start to get better or have a good day. Kinda makes me hope. 

I don't get why people who should know how painful such comments are in that situation post that shit! Don't listen to them and like the other said: There are more than these people! :)"
