ACIM,fpopjyt,t1_fpnj89x,1588788456.0,Such dedication :) This is how you speed up your progress.
ACIM,fpn1jfc,t1_fpm78ak,1588747440.0,"You seem to have this expectation that when the Holy Spirit touches you, you will be alright and out of the despair you feel now. That you will finally be happy and at peace. In other words, you are convinced that you don't have that peace now, or the capacity of having it, and that you have to work more, do more, so you can get it.

The ego is cunning beyond limits. If you tell him: ""I will not follow any goal of this world you tell me, I am done with you, from now on I only want to find peace"", the ego will then say: ""Ok, ok, as you want, let's find peace, but we do it my way"". And we all know the ego's way very well: Feeling sorry about oneself, jealous of others, impotent because we cannot seem to get what we want and feel we deserve after all what we have been through.

u/alliejam, inside this dream, we are separated bodies with unique life circumstances each one of us (different mental maps, genes, parents, country, etc). That is why comparing ourselves to others is not fair to us, nor to them. Rest assured your struggling is a necessary part of the process. Remove any pressure you have put on yourself that you must find peace, because that is like trying to put out fire with gasoline. Go through your day calmly, observing your thoughts passing by like they were cars in a highway, not reacting to them. We don't get upset when we see cars passing by, why should we get upset at our thoughts? They are concerned only about things of this world, thus they are as false as this world is. It is all a dream. Knowing this, how could we not rest in peace? :)

Edit: Clarity of expression."

If you now are happier because a clarity of purpose inside the dream, it is fantastic. If not, no problem, it is fantastic too. Our true happiness comes from following God's will, which is ours. This, what we call our life, has already happened, we are just reviewing it, as an afterimage. The difference is with whom we watch this movie: Holy Spirit or Ego. The choice for the Holy Spirit is what ultimately brings happiness."

ACIM,fpc6p39,t1_fp5jqed,1588489425.0,"Eckhart Tolle even goes so far as to say that the reason why we are ""never upset by the reason we think"", is because we are not in the present moment. What do you think about his interpretation?

I believe that the reason why we are upset has nothing to do of course directly with anything of this world (car broke, parents died, job lost, etc.) but because we need to ""prove"" that the world is real by letting it affect us. We created in the first place the car, the parents and the job, and we put ourselves into a powerless body; we arranged it so we could not reliably count on external things forever. Cars break down making you arrive late to appointments, parents normally die before you do, and you can get fired from your position, losing your means of income and security.

We made a dream in where we are at the mercy of external events. We limited ourselves in every possible way. Feeling upset is just a mechanism to make everything that we created real."
ACIM,fpc59w7,t1_fp4s1wn,1588488059.0,Very good points regarding that behaviour does matter (but right behaviour only comes as a byproduct after right-mindedness) and in recognizing wrong-mindedness in others without judging them. The example about the shooting was very informative. Thank you :)
ACIM,fpc3kzx,t1_fp1chca,1588486488.0,">When you (or anyone else for that matter) like what someone says, you tend to listen to them more and more and agree with them on some things because you agree with them on other things. You hold them and their opinions perhaps in too high of a regard and, in doing so, forfeit your opportunity to form your own individual insight into what the Course means to YOU because you’re caught up in what it means to THEM.

I see your point. However, the course says something along the lines ""God speaks through your brother's voice"". You can get ideas you would not have thought about from other people, and viceversa. You can also refute ideas because you feel there is something else to the matter. After writing this post and hearing more from Ken's workshops I realized there are some things in which I do not completely agree with him. For example, his insistence in that behaviour does not ultimately matter. Maybe you will not reach peace only through behaviour, but your behaviour is a very good measurement of what level of peace you have inside. You cannot be very peaceful if you find yourself putting people down every other day, can you? Or drinking alcohol until you pass out. Those are products of fear, not peace."

But regarding Arten and Pursah, his two ascended masters, the whole story behind it, and the conveniency of deleting any audiovisual proof of that „because they told him to“ is something that hides more to the naked eye than it seems.

As far as I see it, it’s a trick made with all the intention, so we can see the magical power of the ego in action. He will never deny the appearance of the two masters, because if he did, this smoke effect would dissipate. It is because of his story, who absolutely nobody can prove, not even him, that our egos can made from it what they want. Some will believe it and would long for an experience like that. You almost can hear the ego saying „I wonder who I was in the past! Maybe I was a gladiator? Or Julius Caesar? Maybe I was a Samurai in old Japan“ And others will deny it as far fetched because we see it as an attack, and thus our ego has to react as a protection, to preserve what we believe in.

You have to change how you see the world, and what helps enormously in this is to find a purpose. But don’t worry, you don’t have to seek it. The purpose seeks you. You just continue doing your thing. Continue going through life with shitty thoughts, if you have addictions or anxiety, just try to get rid of them without success like you always do. And one day, somehow, you will get fucking tired of it all, and you will take the determination of not being miserable for one more fucking second of your life. This is exactly my purpose in life.

While „ego“ is not a word empty of biased meaning, it is certainly a better choice that Satan or Serpent. Why? The ego in itself is not evil. It is not our enemy. It is just an illusion. We need a term for it in order for us to identify it, but qualifying it of Satan is giving it the evil reality that it has not. Of course it makes us suffer. Of course.

How would you know that we are immune to a certain disease, if you hadn't read that on the news?

Or could it be that we are talking about what do thoughts make a brother **act** out of it, that affects other minds? This is how ACIM was written in the first place, was it not? Thus rendering possible the awakening of uncountable brothers. If Helen had ""just thought"" it, nothing of this would have happened. She wrote it on paper, because ""she had to do it"", in another words, because it was the will of God, and thus, her will, and the will of us all."

depression,eog08xe,t3_brrazj,1558547781.0,"We have to kill our minds, not our bodies. One trick is to become an impersonated character. I couldn't live with myself anymore so some days I act as if I were an angel that God sent down to this body because the person that was living inside was so incompetent at living life that he quit. In fact is the angel who is writing this message to you right now!"
