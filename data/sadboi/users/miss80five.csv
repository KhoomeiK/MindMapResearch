StudentLoans,fpqd838,t1_fppwdsr,1588820191.0,"Just to throw my 2¬¢ in, I agree PSLF is working...if you work it. It‚Äôs still WIDELY unknown and people are misinformed, and the 99% rejection rate was at the very beginning when people didn‚Äôt realize you had to apply to get into the program before you apply for it to be forgiven (and 2 years ago, myself included). That being said, a reduction in interest rate federally won‚Äôt do much for me in the long run bc of PSLF, and my other $58K in student loans are private and already under 4%. 

What I WOULD love to see is a higher cap on student loan interest tax deductions. I‚Äôm currently paying $10K a year in student loan interest between federal and private loans, while only able to claim $2.5K on taxes (which doesn‚Äôt move my refund needle much). Whereas for my mortgage, I can claim all of my interest and PMI on taxes."

I wanted that more than anything for so long and once I started my career (with a VERY shaky start), I forced myself to accept I‚Äôd be alone forever. I didn‚Äôt dabble in relationships, I hooked up with people and became a swinger to not get attached. I met someone with similar traumas early after college through a friend (as a f*ckbuddy first) and realized he was my match. Our friendship grew and grew and although it took us both 10 years to stop denying it, we‚Äôve been officially together for 2 (had a very short ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù with him 5 years ago also). We‚Äôve been through his rehab and my medical issues, through his depression and addiction/sobriety and my BPD. It‚Äôs rough, but it‚Äôs amazing. It‚Äôs hard work, but he‚Äôs worth it. 

If I could give any advice about wanting to be a husband, it would be to cherish your friends. They may turn out to be the one.

There is a portion on their site that says this:

Emergency Forbearance

All borrowers will have the ability to request this emergency administrative forbearance which will allow them to postpone payments for at least 60 days. You can request this forbearance from one of the following options:


Website/Account Access
Mobile App
Automated Phone System


‚Ä¢ Any borrower who is currently or becomes more than 31 days delinquent will automatically have this emergency administrative forbearance applied to their account within 14 days.

‚Ä¢ This forbearance will postpone any required payments and will bring the account to a ""current"" status.

‚Ä¢ Interest will not accrue during this forbearance period.

‚Ä¢ Any remaining unpaid interest from prior to March 13, 2020, should it exist, may be capitalized (added to your principal balance) at the expiration of this forbearance period.

‚Ä¢ A borrower can request that this emergency forbearance be removed or shortened at any time.

‚Ä¢ This emergency administrative forbearance will remain in effect until the Department of Education issues further guidance.

NOTE: Use of this forbearance time will not impact any existing forbearance time remaining on the account. Example: This will not impact any General Hardship Forbearance time available.

Special Considerations for Borrowers Pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness or Loan Forgiveness Through an Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) Plan

‚Ä¢ The time spent on the emergency administrative forbearance will not count toward your required payment count.

‚Ä¢ If your income has changed as a result of COVID-19 you may be eligible for a new lower IDR plan repayment amount. Find out if you qualify for a lower payment at StudentAid.gov/idr."

Two of my takeaways from this SUPER helpful post:

1. FedLoan possibly changing my payment plans without notifying me.
I‚Äôd asked Navient (pre-FedLoan) and confirmed that REPAYE was an eligible IBR plan 4x before switching. Now that I‚Äôm with FedLoan, I‚Äôm going to be VERY conscious about this aspect

2. Payment counts being lost from changing loan servicers pre-FedLoan and applying for forgiveness early to force a deep dive count.
This one I had suspected and planned on since when I moved to FedLoan, they said I had 0 payments. Then when I asked for a recount, they said 7. I know I have 55-56 payments completed. I had anticipated applying in 2024 (a year ahead of my forgiveness date timeline/4 years before their forgiveness timeline) in order to force them to do an actual, thorough count. I‚Äôve already wasted more than a year waiting for them to count to 7.

Now I‚Äôm considering applying for forgiveness now, 4 years ahead of time, to see where I really do stand.  But will this cause any issues later?"

Bullying can cause it. He‚Äôs a bully. And the other person is right, you can‚Äôt argue with stupid. I‚Äôm a social worker and make $45K a year, $139K in SLD and praying I can fight long enough to get PSLF. I‚Äôve been in arguments with people online and get to a point where I say to myself that I can‚Äôt keep arguing with stupid, it‚Äôs only detrimental to me. I may not agree that Bernie is the best choice, but I can wholeheartedly agree that something needs to be done and not just for teens just starting college."
PSLF,f8aedkg,t3_dzeiav,1574394952.0,"I‚Äôm so glad to hear this! Congrats!
They said my count couldn‚Äôt start until I consolidated, which I did late (grad in Jan 2010, consolidated in 2013). I didn‚Äôt realize at the time I needed to do that.
My ‚Äúcount‚Äù is still at 0 payments, being in a manual recount since August of 2018. I will write a letter and see if that helps move it along. I‚Äôd called in Aug 2019 and I stated that the rep in Sept of 2018 said it could take up to a year, the rep in Aug 2019 said no there is no time frame for recounts and were only up to 2009 (my payment timeline). My roadblock is my spotty work history (I‚Äôm an MSW, with often burnout and some for profit MH work). 
These kinds of posts give me hope and light my fire to keep fighting the good fight! I can‚Äôt wait to get my $79K (only federal, not including my private loans) forgiven in 5 years!"

StudentLoanSupport,f7cavqa,t3_dv4e34,1573588233.0,"Have you looked into Income Based Repayment? I‚Äôm not sure if you would qualify for PSLF yet since a grocery store is usually for profit, but I would definitely inquire about IBR. It would only be paying a fraction (I think 5% of your current income) each month for the loans. 
Let me just say that suicide would take the burden off of you, but it would not take it off of your family. Your loans would then be fully the responsibility of your mom. Not just that, but I know how overwhelming student loans can be. 

I‚Äôm $139K in debt as a social worker making $40K a year. It feels never-ending, but it‚Äôs NOT the end of your world. 

I will also say it can feel like you‚Äôre all alone in this, but you‚Äôre not. When my mom would say things like everyone your age is under this insurmountable debt/burden, I would say idc about everyone else, I‚Äôm in this hole and I want out. I‚Äôm slowly climbing out and hoping PSLF will pay off. You‚Äôre not alone and if nothing else, stay alive to give a big ‚Äòfuck you‚Äô to the DOE. 

You WILL get out of this and you can do it. Nothing lasts forever and this won‚Äôt last forever. So stay here to see the ending.

Edit: I also want to give you a text line for someone to speak to when you feel most overwhelmed. 741-741 in the US. It‚Äôs a peer line for those who are thinking of self-harm, suicide, feeling shitty, anxious, depressed, etc. Just text it and say Hi or Home. It‚Äôs a live person texting you back."

sex,f5yaqxn,t3_dpj8f0,1572553348.0,"Here‚Äôs also something. How often is she using a vibe on her own to masturbate? If she overuses it, it causes the clitoris to kind of numb out the nerves, if you will. Have her take a break from using a vibe. A vibe is a great sensation, but not one that can be replicated by manual stimulation.  Also, some women need both clit and vaginal penetration to orgasm. What and where is she already using when she comes on her own? 
Have you fingered her g-spot? She‚Äôs the expert on her body so what you could do is tell her to guide you. Let her use your fingers as a masturbation tool. Have her verbally direct you when you‚Äôre giving her oral. Not only does this teach you, but it also enhances communication skills (both in and out of the bedroom) between you both."
sex,f5y9jg9,t3_dpj8f0,1572552831.0,"As a woman, I can say that the old adage of treating her like a stripper is along the lines of good advice. I thoroughly love when a guy touches my body as if he wants to ravage me. If she‚Äôs insecure about her body, start there. It‚Äôs not just about compliments about looking good in general. When my dude grabs my butt around the house or is more touchy freely, it amps up the anticipation. If you‚Äôre saying things that are in particular to her, it could help. Things like, ‚ÄòI love the way your tits look in that top‚Äô or ‚Äòyour ass is so perfect, it makes me hard‚Äô or ‚ÄòI‚Äôve never seen such a perfect pussy‚Äô or ‚Äòthe way you get wet makes me wanna take you right here, right now.‚Äô Obviously, make them more personalized to her.
