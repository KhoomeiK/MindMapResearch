I’ve seen that you appreciate that she is advocating for you; however, she has turned this into the pain/trauma/sacrifice olympics. You do not owe your mother anything. You are not responsible for taking care of your mother. She chose to have children and with children comes some sacrifice. That guilt you feel is basically a button that was installed during childhood. You don’t have to give her anything and what you’ve said you want to use the money for is a good plan. She said she wants to make sure you don’t spend it away because you’re young. Understandable if you were still a child but you’re not. Others have recommended having it put in a trust that will pay for the schooling and then you would have what’s left over. That would be a good plan. Ultimately though, while your mother is advocating for you, it is your money to do with what you will. Again, you don’t owe her anything. 

Sorry for the wall of text."

BrandNewSentence,f1vjv2o,t1_f1vdeos,1569771891.0,Yep! Googling rooting succulent leaves. There are a few different methods :)
todayilearned,f1veznf,t1_f1uzw8r,1569770106.0,I’m not able to find that one. Is there something else it may be under?
ChoosingBeggars,f1ppvza,t1_f1plnlz,1569686043.0,"All that time and nobody has died? That’s awesome. My last game I was pretty sure my sister was trying to get us killed. After my niece (who, tbf, is 7 and still learning) rolled a 19 so her High Elf Cleric wearing chainmail was able to sneak past the sneaking goblin splitting up the party, my sister wanted to use fireball in the cave. (She is 37 and does not have the excuse that my niece does) “Well, the DM says it looks stable” Caves usually look stable until they’re not!"
TalesFromThePharmacy,f1pnt7a,t1_f1obw8t,1569684783.0,"When my right ovary torsed and the Fallopian tube wrapped around it I thought I had kidney stones because of where I felt the pain. My husband had me go in anyways. I sat in the waiting room 7 hours, took another 1 1/2 hours for the doc to see me once I was taken to a room. I had emergency surgery that night. By the time they took it out, it was (per the descriptive dr I got) the size of a good baked potato. So, had I just waited it could have really become life or death."

TalesFromThePharmacy,f1dgys4,t1_f1dex3k,1569383771.0,The ER at the VA here has a sign in the waiting room letting you know that patients are seen in order of severity level and that the national average waiting time for an ER is 4-6 hours to be taken back and seen.
NatureIsFuckingLit,f1aulgx,t1_f19p86q,1569308042.0,Thank you for a new channel to watch!
BeautyBoxes,f1a0jqx,t1_f1a0dol,1569282517.0,Awesome! Thank you so much! She wasn’t entirely sure what it is she’s reacting to so I figured if she leaned more towards something for sensitive skin it would help.
