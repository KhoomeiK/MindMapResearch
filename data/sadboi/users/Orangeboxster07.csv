trt,fenqn8q,t3_dr3vd9,1579289388.0,Your welcome.  Best of luck.
trt,fenofka,t1_fem18ft,1579288544.0,"No I just took it for 6 weeks to get my levels up.  The doctor recommended this as a nature way instead of injections or creams.  It work well, it increased my total and free T really nicely but I got some really bad anxiety that lead to depression.  So bad that I stopped taking it and now waiting for it to get out of my system.    Not sure if I’m going to try injections or creams because I don’t want that anxiety to come back.  It was a really bad experience."
depression,feh1m02,t1_feh0e2h,1579107249.0,Yes.  Going through this right now.  F-ing sucks.
depression,fe5h2dg,t3_eno7v3,1578869367.0,I had my therapist tell me to go to church as much as I can!!!  Lol.
Testosterone,fdhsoe6,t3_el5r9n,1578429426.0,"Glad your doing well.  I was on Tamoxifen for 6 weeks at 20mg everyday.  It increased my total and free T levels very nicely but I had a horrible reaction to it.  I got really bad anxiety and depression, mood swings, irritability and some trouble breathing.  There were a couple days I thought I needed to go to the ER because I was having a heart attack.  But everyone reacts differently to medicine so it might work for you without the side effects.  For me I will never touch this stuff again."
trt,fd2qghn,t1_fccjf43,1578150684.0,"Well it raised my total test and free test levels nicely.  But I got some really bad anxiety about 5 weeks into the treatment.  Prior to week 5 I was feeling really good and then it felt like someone pulled the rugged out from me.  I’m thinking that it has to do with my estradiol levels being increased to almost the highest level of normal.  I’m not an expert on this by any means but to me it seems to make sense, higher estradiol levels increased anxiety.  I have an appointment on Monday so I’ll see what my doctor has to say about it.  

As far as a final verdict.  I not happy at all with tamoxifen as a stand alone treatment.  Even though it did increase total and free test I don’t feel any different then before treatment.  I still have low energy, motivation, drive, libido, etc.  The only thing it did was give me some crazy anxiety issues.  But like all medicine everyone is different on how they react to it.  I just didn’t react well to it."
GetMotivated,fc0cibn,t3_efdvrr,1577286880.0,Really just trying to help people out that are in the same boat.  Holidays are rough and some people need to know that there not alone and things get better. Obviously you’re not one of them.  But I’ll continue to smoke my Meth because you got me on that one.  I just got a bunch for Christmas so I’ll be set for at least a couple days maybe a little bit longer if I don’t over indulge!!!
GetMotivated,fc0998f,t3_efdvrr,1577283737.0,"Yes.  Let it go!!!  It’s hard as hell to do but it does work in the long run.  I had as much of a normal life as one can expect to have.  Had really no worries, no anxiety and no depression.  The last couple years sent me into a downward spiral to the point of being self admitted into a inpatient center.  I struggled with everyday life from waking up and getting out of bed to being able to still perform at work.  Everything was falling down around me and it felt like there was nothing I could do about it.  This is a scary feeling when it feels like all hope is lost.  But by seeking help, trying different meds for over a year and then finally finding a combination that work as well as going to therapy I’m slowly changing for the better.  I had horrible racing thoughts that constantly ran through my head from the moment I woke up to the time I went to bed.  It was literally a living nightmare.  These thoughts made daily living a major hassle and burden on me and my family.  They consumed my life from morning to night to the point of not properly taking care of myself, not being able to focus or concentrate, becoming very irritable, not really caring about other people, had no energy or motivation to do anything but just be in zombie mode all day long.  The meds and therapy definitely helped me out a lot but you also have to put some work in yourself.  There’s unfortunately no magic pill, trust me I tried pretty much all of them.  Once I was able to progressively remove these unwanted thoughts things started to get better.  It wasn’t easy and it’s something that didn’t happen over night.  I had to stick with the medicine regime and therapy like my life depending on it because it did.  I’m now almost back to my normal self.  My racing thoughts have subsided, my energy and motivation is coming back and I have a much more positive outlook on life and people around me.  The main point is that once I learned to let go of those thoughts the better I started to feel and the more I started to regain my life back.  I know how it feels when motivation is gone, but you need to scrape up what motivation you have to seek help.  I know it’s very very tough to do, but you need to push deep down inside yourself to find some.  For me that last bit I had literally saved my life.  Wishing everyone Happy Holidays and the courage to continue pushing through the hard times because better times await!"
depression,fblanal,t1_fbl791p,1576960296.0,"Yes!  I completely understand that.  Although there have been times where I have repeated myself and still got nothing!  I just don’t get it.  It’s not like I’m saying something nonsensical or off topic.   I feel what I have to say adds to the conversation, at least in my eyes.  It definitely plays a huge part in why I’m so shy and have social anxiety."
depression,fbl6yym,t3_edhcd2,1576959091.0,"Yes all the time.   Even when I feel good and try to chime in on the conversation, it feels like no one really cares about what I have to say.  I almost have to question myself as to if they heard me or not.  It’s a very awkward feeling.  That’s why most of the time I just sit and listen."
trt,f89iq53,t1_f824x92,1574373766.0,Wow that’s great info thanks!
trt,f7sp9fa,t1_f7qh40g,1573997001.0,Absolutely. I’m taking 10mg once a day.  Any other questions feel free to ask.  I’m not an expert on this medicine but I have no problems answering questions pertaining to my journey on this Medicine.
trt,f7nn01h,t1_f7mzoie,1573910825.0,To be honest I’m not quite sure.  It will be 2 full weeks on Monday that I have been taken the medicine.  I feel I little bit more energetic and not as fatigued in the afternoon.  Seems like I got more focused and clear headed then before.  I’ve been getting morning wood again but not every morning.  Still have trouble maintaining an erection and libido hasn’t really changed much.  I asked the doctor when I should notice the effect and he said some patients feel results in 2 weeks while other may feel results in 4 weeks.  I guess it is too early to tell.  I’m also on depression meds and just got an increase of dosage right around when I started so I’m not sure if some of the feelings I’m getting is because of that.  Good thing is I haven’t gotten any of the side effects.  Thanks for asking and I’ll keep you posted once I hit the 3 week mark.
trt,f6hw21e,t1_f6gsz66,1572866593.0,"I've seen those same posts and have read about that side effect as well.  With any Med there is always risks of side effects, but this is why my doctor choose Nolvadex.  I guess there are fewer sides with this Med.  I'll keep you posted on what happens.  Hoping for the best."
trt,f6gsibm,t1_f6gimio,1572829904.0,It is interesting.  I've always heard that bodybuilders use it for PCT to restart their natural production.  I get my prescription tomorrow so if you want I can keep you updated on how its working.
trt,f6gi8be,t1_f6f53f2,1572826319.0,No my E2 levels were fine.  He said that the Nolvadex will help raise my LH production which in return will help raise my free testosterone levels.
trt,f6g009r,t1_f6flmrk,1572820206.0,Cool thanks for the info.  I appreciate it.
TherapeuticKetamine,f578ji2,t1_f4tmbod,1572032813.0,"Wow I’m so happy your doing so well now.  I also took a leave of absence from work because I admitted myself into an inpatient center for 2 and a half weeks.  I got so bad I attempted ending it all.  I went through a real rough stretch that made me spiral downward real fast and real hard.  Long story.  I’ve heard good things about TMS treatment.  I was realistically suppose to go through with that first before the Ketamine treatment.  That’s the protocol of the psychiatrist I went to see about the Ketamine but my normal psychiatrist who recommended me to this psychiatrist specifically wanted me to try Ketamine.  I guess he’s a big shot in this area, Lol, because I just went right on Ketamine. Once I got up in dosage I started to feel the changes.  120mg seemed to be the magic number for me.  I feel fantastic now.  My whole outlook on life has changed and I’m back to being positive again.  My next step is to slowly get off of the meds I’m on since I’m doing so much better and see what happens, which I looking forward to because I gained a lot of weight on them and I’m having trouble losing it.  I’m hoping by getting of the meds I can lose the weight a little easier because since I got my mental health in check, my new goal is to get my physical health in check.  Keep me updated with your progress and if you ever have a question you don’t feel comfortable posting, you can always send me a message.  Best of luck!"
TherapeuticKetamine,f4rr1gm,t1_f4qjqc8,1571770842.0,You got it.  How's the treatment working for you so far?
TherapeuticKetamine,f4ojxjq,t1_f4ar3sg,1571702786.0,No worries  Mine is the same as yours.  100MG/ML.  Each one of my sprays equals 10mg.  Hope that helps.
trt,f4djg3b,t1_f4cswnl,1571543444.0,Thanks for your reply.  I’m actually going through Defy Medical now.  My levels are low for my age and I have a lot of symptoms but there not below normal.  So my doctor prescribed me testosterone and I was gonna use GoodRx to help with the cost.  Didn’t realize how much nonsense GoodRx is and just decided to go through Defy Medical.  I’m the next couple weeks I’ll be setup with my protocol and will be doing injections.
TherapeuticKetamine,f49rujp,t1_f003ktt,1571481777.0,"Hey been awhile since i updated.  Been on 120mg for the last month with some good results.  I met with the psychiatrist about a week ago to discuss how I'm feeling and to see if I need to switch to everyday treatment or continue with every other day treatment.  To be honest I do notice a slight difference on my off days.  I always take my dose in the evening/night time.  Usually I'll start feeling a little off by the next day typically by the evening time and into the next day.  I'm not slipping back into major depression or anything like that.  I just notice I'm not feeling as good as a should.  It doesn't effect my day or functionality at work or in my personal life.  I just do notice a difference.  After talking to my psychiatrist he decided to keep me on every other day treatment but up the dose to 150mg and see if this helps with my off days of treatment.  I'm to give it a try for a couple weeks to see how it goes and if I'm still noticing this difference on my off days, then will will discuss a everyday treatment plan.  Hope everything is going well with you."
depressionregimens,f48paqt,t1_f48hpia,1571445067.0,"Never knew that about the IV treatment.  I can say that the compounded formulation that I’m taking is life changing.  It took awhile to finally get to a dose that seemed to work but it was worth the wait.  I got frustrated in the beginning because I wasn’t getting any positive results and thought it wasn’t going to work.  But man once I got up to a higher dose, what a game changer.  I’m so happy my psychiatrist recommended this to me since all other meds I was on didn’t work.  I am still taking Depakote and Latuda because I had some success with this combo and my psychiatrist doesn’t want to change anything yet.  The only change he made was taking me off Paxil.  Down the road my psychiatrist plans to temper down the Latuda and Depakote to the point of coming off them.  Overall this Ketamine treatment is the best thing I have taken to combat depression."
trt,f37clpw,t1_f35eg9q,1570724252.0,Not taken as rude.  I did have a long conversation with my doctor and asked him all the questions i had for him pertaining to the Androgel.  I just like to get feedback from others who have gone this route to see how it worked for them and there experience with it.  I googled the crap out of it already to gain as much info as possible.  I figured i'd post this question here just to get some more info on the matter.  I'm one that likes to get as much info as possible.
Testosterone,f368npl,t1_f35szq3,1570708442.0,Yeah I’m just happy to start some kind of treatment.  I’ll give to 3 months and see what happens.  Thanks
Testosterone,f368iqj,t1_f35fn5e,1570708363.0,Good luck with the injections.  I get my prescription today so I’m going to try it out and see what happens with my levels.  If it’s not working then hopefully he’ll let me do the injections.
Testosterone,f36881y,t1_f3540pz,1570708191.0,Thanks for the reply.  I did bring up taking the injections which I’d rather do but he wants to try this first.  I’m just glad I found a doctor who is willing to treat me.
Testosterone,f32zxzi,t3_de89qr,1570629304.0,"I'm in the same boat.  I know your suppose to get levels checked in the early morning which i have done over the years.  I just so happen to be getting my yearly physical at 3pm and asked the doctor if she could run a testosterone check, which she did.  My results were 205ng/dL and Free T was 7.7pg/mL.  With these results she wanted me to get them rechecked but in the morning like your suppose to.  However this time she only tested Serum level which was 381ng/dL.  Back in the normal range and right around where I've also been.  Mid to high 300's.  Have all the symptoms of low T and really crash in the afternoon as far as energy goes.  Made a appointment to see an Endo to see if there's anything that can be done.  Best of luck to you."
Testosterone,f27uonn,t1_f263mjx,1570046466.0,Sorry to hear that.  I probably wouldn't have got my levels check in the afternoon if i didn't go for my physical and ask for them to check it.  Glad i did.  But now i need to find a doctor who can treat me.  Hoping my current doctor will.
Testosterone,f27ub9i,t1_f251ams,1570046243.0,Do you find that is really made a big difference in your everyday life?
Testosterone,f24zukk,t1_f24tb76,1569963258.0,Good point.  Are you on TRT?
Testosterone,f24qf5t,t1_f24bdyg,1569958057.0,True.  I just hope he's a fast learner.  Lol.
Testosterone,f246pf4,t1_f22j97p,1569945879.0,Just got in contact with my doctor.  Unfortunately he doesn’t have experience with TRT but he’s going to look into it to see what he can do for me.  Hoping for the best.  Can’t stand feeling like crap.  Thanks again for the help.
Testosterone,f23tfe6,t1_f22j97p,1569937155.0,Thanks for the reply.  I actually went to GoodRx last night and was amazed how cheap it is.  Now I just have to get my doctor on board with this.  He told me to start taking ashwagandha. So I did some research on it and it seems like it does increase T levels according to some studies but then I also read that any kind of supplement that suggests it increases T levels don’t come close to taking the real thing.  I’d rather spend my money on what’s going to work.  Thanks again
Testosterone,f23swfv,t1_f22d95g,1569936757.0,Thanks for the advice.  I didn’t realize it was so cheap.  Going to call my doctor today and inquire about going this route.  Thanks again.
Testosterone,f23srih,t1_f237f3u,1569936655.0,That is strange.  Wonder how that’s possible.
depressionregimens,f1qukac,t1_f1nugz1,1569706790.0,My insurance is paying for the doctors visit.  I have to pay out of pocket for the medicine.  But the medicine only cost $80 and that’s for a 5 month supply.
TherapeuticKetamine,ezzeidr,t1_ezlftew,1568285584.0,Just a quick update.  Called my doctor yesterday to discuss my progress on 100mg.  After our discussion she raised my dose to 120mg every other day.  I’m going to do this for a week and then report back to her with how I feel.  Will see how this goes.
TherapeuticKetamine,ezpg0k3,t3_d05zxa,1568039941.0,Interesting.  I never got that. I just feel like I’m a little buzzed.  Like having a couple drinks.
TherapeuticKetamine,ezovn2d,t1_ezofcce,1568028911.0,I think at the current dose of 100mg I do a little bit.  But not nearly as much as I have read about others.  Do you disassociate at your dose?  If so what does it feel like?
TherapeuticKetamine,ezm96o1,t1_ezltie5,1567988621.0,Yeah.
TherapeuticKetamine,ezlgbow,t1_ezlftew,1567976341.0,Your welcome.  Best of luck.
TherapeuticKetamine,ezldzoc,t1_ez9ipab,1567975539.0,I’m taking 100mg every other day.  I have to call the doctor Wednesday so the dose might go up.
TherapeuticKetamine,ezldtfl,t1_ez9gtd1,1567975468.0,Just to get back to with you about dose.  I’m currently taking 100mgs every other day.  Comes out to 10mgs per spray.
TherapeuticKetamine,ezldaxi,t1_ezl3qlu,1567975271.0,Thanks I appreciate it.
depressionregimens,ezkcrzk,t1_ezk5efi,1567958367.0,Sorry to hear the infusions didn’t work for you.  I’m hoping this works too.  As of now it’s giving me a little relief but the depression is still there.  Hoping it will get better after a couple more weeks.
EmotionalAbuseSupport,ezdpc3y,t3_cbx4b6,1567853263.0,"I can't help you define this behavior but i can relate to your situation.  My ex would do the same thing but with my parents.  Anytime she thought of going on vacation she would go running to my parents and tell them about her idea.  And this was done without my knowledge.  Both my parents are retired and love going places so they usually went with us and the kids.  But my ex knew that my parents are very generous people who would offer to pay for all four of us or at least the kids.  Well she took full advantage of this, not only for vacations but apparently she did this for many other things throughout the years without me knowing.  Definitely manipulative behavior but not sure what personally trait this would fall under."
TherapeuticKetamine,ez9tkpk,t1_ez9gtd1,1567789259.0,That’s awesome I’m so glad it has worked for you!
TherapeuticKetamine,ez95y91,t1_ez7xky5,1567773959.0,Off the top of my head I’m not sure what the dosage is.  I’ll find out when I get home and let you know.  Wow $10 per treatment is great.  I have Aetna and in their policy it’s still considered experimental so they don’t cover it.  How has the Spravato been working for you?
TherapeuticKetamine,ez95pil,t1_ez8aq15,1567773760.0,I can relate to the sinus feeling and the awful taste.  Like I said before I’m just over 3 weeks into it and every week my dose went up another 2 sprays.  This was based off of my doctor and I reviewing how I felt.  Right now I’m at 10 sprays every other day.  Not sure what that equates to off the top of my head but I’ll find out and let you know when I get home.  I am a bigger guy 6’2 270lbs and was told that my dosage will more then likely be going up for a couple weeks just based off of my size.  So far I feel some relief but definitely not feeling like some people that I have read about.  Best of luck to you and I will keep you updated.
TherapeuticKetamine,ez951m3,t1_ez7zlzh,1567773186.0,Definitely in the same boat you were in.  I feel like this is my last hope.  I have a laundry list of meds I tried with no positive results.  I’m absolutely anxious about his process for the same reasons you stated.  I know I just started the process and maybe I was expecting quicker results since it seemed like others have had fast relief.  I’ve being going to therapy for years now and it has helped but I’m still battling everyday to push through and be positive.  Some days are better then others.  I’m trying to let myself be happy because I used to be a very happy person.  However the last 4 years have been a living hell for me and happiness seems to be a long lost friend I’m constantly looking for.  Thanks for the reply.  I hope I have similar results as you did.
TherapeuticKetamine,ez947ax,t1_ez7vgf7,1567772445.0,"Not quite yet.  I still find myself isolating and really unmotivated.  However I do feel some sort of relief but not nearly what I thought I would feel from what I have read about others using it.  Maybe I’m just not at the dose I need yet.  My doctor starts everyone out on a very low dose so the side effects, if they experience them, doesn’t scare them away from continuing use."
depressionregimens,ez6vlkh,t1_ez6tdrl,1567715651.0,As far as i know I'm going to be taking this for the foreseeable future.  Thanks for the replies
depressionregimens,ez6prs5,t1_ez6p13p,1567714328.0,I was told to take it every other day.  Are infusions that much better?
depressionregimens,ez6j3pk,t1_ez6ik64,1567712656.0,thanks
Anxiety,eyykgc4,t1_eyyh471,1567592009.0,That’s a huge step in the right direction!  You should be very proud of yourself for going through with this.  Best of luck!
