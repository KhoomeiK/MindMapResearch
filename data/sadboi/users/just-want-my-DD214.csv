Similar situation, my dad passed in December and I was left to deal with the funeral expenses. Thankfully I was granted emergency leave and a ticket was funded all the way to home of record.

Typically the funeral home will contact public records office wherever his home of record was, and there should be evidence of his military time. If you have a DD214 from his discharge that would also suffice, my dad was also in the navy.

Unfortunately funerals are a business for many companies, and expenses can reach upwards of 10-15,000. I spoke with the funeral home director (very small town) and talked about my limited funding and explained the situation,  they covered the majority of the expenses. I ended up paying about 3,000 and they were more than ok with a payment plan.

No, what you are doing  is not any different from the others telling people to vote for trump. I would call them out to say they aren’t yang gang either if that’s what they’re saying. My point I was making in that comment was that if you are here saying you support Andrew Yang, are volunteering and donating, and he’s the only candidate you think makes sense—then vote for him, regardless of the outcome. I didn’t vote in the last primary election because I don’t believe in lesser of two evils.

Furthermore, Yang gets quite a bit of support from republicans as well as democrats. Him converting trump supporters is evidence of that. With that, yang’s policies have a much better chance of success through congress. Bernie is very far left, and there are a lot of republicans who hate his policy ideas. 

If Yang isn’t nominated, then I probably again won’t vote. I will not put my vote behind someone that I have very gross difference of opinion with their policies.

I don’t know why you would say America isn’t ready for Yang. You see the support that he gets. If you have faith and are volunteering, you would see the insane amount of progress he’s made. What other candidate this election cycle MISSED qualifying for a debate, and then the very next debate? Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t think there has been a single quarter that every one of Yang’s numbers hasnt improved.
