TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fqwd0mp,t1_fqw02a3,1589700094.0,"I feel really bad for gen z and younger millennial women who are growing up and dating men who started watching porn at a young age where intense rough sex, choking, crazy kinky stuff is the norm. If someone finds they like that through experimentation with a willing partner then great, but from what I've seen it's become the default. My boyfriend's only exposure growing up was a rare videotape or like, a nudie mag or the softcore on HBO. Even the first time I slept with a man in 2010 he was in the moment, gentle and attentive and I didn't feel like I was being viewed through a porn lens. I didn't get slapped, or choked, or pressured into trying anal or bending into a pretzel.

I've read so many stories even here on reddit about women who are too afraid to call out their men on porn addictions and instead feel like they're not good enough and have to keep trying wilder and crazier things because that's what their husbands / boyfriend's expect and if they don't act like pornstars in the bedroom they're inadequate."

It is a bit different for minorities such as women and POC even though we don't really jump in anymore because there is no use fighting the prevailing negative stereotypes, and the people who post them are ignorant anyway.

So I usually say to men, if women say men do something harmful and you don't, that means that you are outside of the stereotype. You are your own individual person and man and you have no need to defend your entire gender because you are a good person and you don't need to prove that."

He's not even fucking TRYING to arrest him, he's just beating on someone who he knows can't fight back or it's a certain bullet. Absolutely fucking abhorrent"
SCAcirclejerk,fppr60t,t1_fpo8vjm,1588807561.0,I don't know what people are doing to drop them so often. Are they just sooooo moisturized they can't get a good grip on anything?
FragileWhiteRedditor,fpppvt4,t1_fpoplp8,1588806857.0,Honestly if I'm ranting on the internet and I have to slow down and fix all my autocorrect I just calm down and realize it's not worth it and how stupid I'm acting
grunge,fpppgc4,t1_fpncuoy,1588806622.0,"I just see so much venom every time she's even mentioned. Like she's insane, a whore, a junkie, wish she would have died instead, just awful stuff. I know she's definitely no role model and has done a lot of questionable things, but I rarely hear the same disgust about any male artist who did probably the same shit. Idk it's probably a combo of both with the idea that she killed Kurt leading in the hatred and coloring it so the people who believe it hate everything she does."
AskReddit,fpmy0zp,t1_fpl9ffs,1588744695.0,When I was a kid I had tried chocolate covered ones once and loved them. Being like 10 I had no idea why they had a bowl of them out at the perfume counter at the department store and popped a few in my mouth and ate them. It's been 17 years and I'm still haunted by that thought and taste lmao

AreTheStraightsOK,fpm8azh,t1_fpk8li3,1588727612.0,"My podiatrist / surgeon has the weirdest darkest sense of humor but not in a ""sexual"" creepy way. He's like in his 50s I think. My first surgery he marked which ankle was being operated on and was like ""ok so I'll remember to cut this one off and leave the other"" and it was so dry it made me crack up and lose my nerves. I was on the table ready to be put under and I was like I'm bugging dude this is my first surgery and he was like oh it's okay, its mine too! And I laughed again and it made my first experience go super smooth.

Like, if in doubt, dad jokes are always a hit especially with that dynamic of an older male doctor and young female. There should never be a reason to make any sort of inappropriate comment even when trying to make a joke"

I think the only thing I wasn't sure of was how exactly to wear a pad and how tired I was going to be but those are fixable. It sucked, I started mine at the end of year field day in sixth grade so I was crampy and uncomfortable but wasn't scared. I can't imagine how terrifying its gotta be for girls who have no idea what's going on and I agree with you it should be discussed by age 9"

AreTheStraightsOK,fpb8bai,t1_fpb2s68,1588464257.0,"I had to kind of educate my boyfriend on this a bit. I've never really been religious, my family was in the Mormon church for like 3 years and I hated it. As such our family doesn't really care about god and Jesus expletives. He got terrified and said I was going to hell and had to stop and I was like my dude, you may not use the name in vain like Mormonism taught you but you had a kid out of wedlock and you drink alcohol and caffeine and smoke and do drugs once in awhile. I still respect that it makes him uncomfortable and try to avoid it since it's been beaten into his head his whole life but he's re-thought the whole thing and doesn't tell me anything about what I choose to believe anymore and I don't hear about hell anymore."
