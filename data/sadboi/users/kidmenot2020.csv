depression,fr10eu8,t3_glyuon,1589810774.0,"yes, social media can be a great deal but also can have a very bad impact on you mentally, its a place where people only post they glam shit and their best ""happy"" life and that might make you feel worse for some reasons, especially now during quarantine where everybody literally is on it 24/7 its extremely addictive and i can give one advice that is good to have a detox from it all, like just log out literally log out of gram and fcb and try to stay away from it for few days its really refreshing, if you really need to talk to ur friends call them, txt them they can do the same, in the time that you are detoxing from it! stay safe!"

AbletonCracks,fqwpypw,t3_f2qov7,1589713599.0,"same here, and it's mad frustrating tho, and it's not just for Ableton basically Catalina is an issue, I have tried installing a few different daws ( reaper, pro tools, bitwig studio, pro Sonos studio one, ) and nothing, until getting current mac set up I was a windows user and FL studio for years, tried getting FL for Catalina too but didn't work properly and a bunch of shit was missing, crazy hard to get hold of a cracked daw that would work on Catalina, done a lot of digging and apparently best way is to downgrade to Mojave, at the moment got no working daw at all!!! any help would be much appreciated, thank you!"
