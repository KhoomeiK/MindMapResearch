one of mine moved to my town to a homeless shelter, i didn’t know until i ran into them at a store.
That was about four weeks ago, my husband has ask for a no contact from them now. But since they are now in my town i know i will see them again at some point and i won’t leave my house alone .
Nightmares pretty much since that first sighting.
They used to be over four hours away.
I dont know how any of us will do this- but i believe we will succeed!! We made it this far without knowing our strength and now we are learning our strength, so we go this!! 
I say this will be a good year for all of us"
