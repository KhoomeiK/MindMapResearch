AmItheAsshole,fr183qa,t3_gly1dg,1589815029.0,I'm depressed af about my life and the world but still go to work everyday and take care of myself. Just waiting it out I guess. But you have given your daughter so much and the fact that she's never had a job at 23 is mind blowing. To live rent free with room and board would be a huge blessing to me.  Everyone experiences depression differently and if it is the case with her maybe you all would benefit from counciling. Since you're the parent and she's acting like a child just make an appointment for the family and see what's up with her. Now most therapies are online so there's no reason not to. I get having kids is a life long commitment but also preparing your children for grown up life is part of being a parent. Push that baby bird out of the nest but make sure she can fly on her own. You are doing a disservice to her and her future partner if you let it go on. Anyway hope things work out for you and your family.
JUSTNOMIL,fr15s5f,t3_glyfz1,1589813789.0,"I, personally just my thoughts, think it's weird to take someone's name when getting married. Why as women do we need to change our names? Oh cuz of property rights. I also thought if I ever had children, I'm not, that they would keep my last name since I popped them out.  You mil is a bitch for purposefully excluding you I wouldn't want her ugly ass name either. I always thought if I got married that we would come up with a new name anyway or hyohenate them. What is a last name besides some old time dude who had sex and gave them the name. Idk seems so old school to me."

They love going out but my strong boy Sylvester likes to be still then take off running nearly yanking the leash out of my hands so that's a concern.

Aside from that that's really interesting you dated and married a deaf man. My brothers father is deaf and we knew sign language growing up. I studied asl in college and was almost an interpreter but found it wasn't for me. Do you do interpreting?
