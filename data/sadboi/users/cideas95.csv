therapy,fn80478,t1_fmur2xs,1586731133.0,"Thanks for the response. I have noticed just how much I want to pity myself, and im at the point now where I myself find it annoying. I can only imagine what it's like for the people who are nice and feel they need to hear me out. It's such a useless thing to do, self-pity. But for some reason, I'm drawn to doing it, and when it starts happening, I have to distract myself. It's irritating, but I suppose it's teaching me to focus, which is a skill I'm sorely in need of.

I've been reading ""When bad things happen to good people"" by Harold Kushner. It talks a lot about these sort of thoughts, and it's been very helpful to me. If you're looking for a good read, try it out."

depression,fe6c25f,t3_enrs4c,1578886622.0,"Definitely. I feel like there's not really a point in sharing my bad thoughts because it just seems like whining at some point, even though keeping them all locked up inside isn't good either.
Even if they understand, what can they do for me, really?"

Life,fb3wu3u,t3_ebbquo,1576493559.0,"Unfortunately, part of life is learning to let go. I don't know anything about your particular situation, but if there's no chance of getting back together, then you have to try to let go. It doesn't come easily, but clinging on to things best left in the past only keeps you distracted and will keep you from taking advantage of opportunities, in my experience. It'll keep you from being able to appreciate anything in front of you.
I say this all as a person who struggles regularly with this. It's difficult, but I just try to focus on staying mindful rather than ruminating on the past."
