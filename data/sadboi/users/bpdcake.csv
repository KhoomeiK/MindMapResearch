insaneparents,fd55z7h,t1_fd4zjp1,1578174529.0,"It's an invasion of privacy, parent or not, you shouldn't be going through anyone's messages, just don't get your kid a phone if you're going to be that psychotic. 

And as far as ""nudes"" go. Sorry to break it to everyone but if you push your kid too far they're just going to do it anyway. Like the saying goes: ""strict parents create sneaky kids"".

Downvote all ya want :)"

BPD,fbww9jv,t1_fbww136,1577161141.0,"Yeah, it made me feel like I was just some girl he was dating when he's known me for almost 10 years. And then his friends not talking to me really threw me over the edge."

BPD,fbqtyzj,t1_fblvegc,1577035672.0,"The issue is, the psychiatrist won't prescribe me them. I took Ativan before for my panic attacks, I made 3 of them last me a whole month but they assume I'm going to be addicted, I've taken other benzos from friends and they really helped and I've never had an issue with taking them. I've never really been addicted to anything."

BPD,fbdqcij,t1_fbdq559,1576768906.0,"I was talking to the psych about my anxiety and panic disorder, I'm having troubles even leaving the house and having panic attacks at least once a day. So she prescribed me that to help with them, it's decreased my anxiety a bit (placebo maybe?) but I'm still having issues going out in busy areas/cars/etc. Panic attacks are still present."
BPD,fbcavuh,t3_eclo16,1576719743.0,"Okay, I'm pretty sure your therapist shouldn't have told you that. You saying you don't want to right there is a sign that you shouldn't. It doesn't sound like a big thing but it works for me, when I'm feeling really deep in my depression I think about even the smallest thing that will keep me alive and most times it helps me get out of how I'm feeling. 
Talk to a different therapist and try to get the proper help you deserve."
BPD,fbcamkp,t3_ecm03z,1576719577.0,"For some reason it's like the words ""are you okay"" trigger an emotional thing for me. I've never experienced it when nothing is wrong though, it could possibly stem from the traumatic thing that happened but just be sure to remember to bring it up with your therapist.

Good luck :)"
BPD,fbc0qo4,t3_eccmh7,1576712848.0,"I've never told anyone this before (until now, obviously), but I feel the exact same way. Like when my friends are talking about even fighting with their significant others a part of me hopes they just break up and when/if they finally do I feel weirdly satisfied, and not in a way of ""good for you for leaving that person"" more of like ""ha, you're alone now"". 
I feel terrible for this."
BPD,fb1mds3,t1_fb1ko9t,1576438453.0,"Yeah, honestly it helps getting perspectives from the outside because I'm starting to think he's a narcissist but I can't tell at this point. I hold a lot of my feelings in now because it ends up being my fault why I felt that way."
BPD,fb1cwpc,t3_eb2k36,1576435093.0,"That's the best thing about reddit, when you feel like no one cares you can come here and it honestly helps me. I was going through the same thing where no one would talk to me or noticed what was going on, then I just scrolled through reddit and actually made a new friend that day just talking to people and reading what they had to say.

I'm sorry you're going through this but you are not alone and you do matter. Sometimes it takes reaching out to people, even if it means talking to new people and potentially making new friends.

I'm not very good at responses/comments on reddit but I hope this slightly helps at least."
BPD,faw1tha,t1_favv9le,1576364792.0,I like this.
BPD,favg25m,t3_eaea34,1576358505.0,"I do the same thing and it's really annoying, it feels like I can't talk myself out of thinking irrationally. Distractions sometimes help but most of the time it's like I'm just very stubborn."
BPD,fav7c1y,t1_fauoxq4,1576356308.0,Such a good way to describe it. üôåüèª
