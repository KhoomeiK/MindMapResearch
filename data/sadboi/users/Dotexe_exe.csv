GE but i totally don't deserve the rank.



Been playing a lot during 2017 - 2019


Peaked at 120hours / 2 weeks



Stopped playing at LEM, lost rank 3 times and every time i came back i was placed in a higher skill group



After a few matches, it turns out i became global in 2 wins and 6 losses.



I can only interpret this as my account having unbelievably high MMR from the past days and it has since catched up. Glad i'm global now but i dont really like how this rank plays. Been seeing a lot of cheaters and i don't do as well as usual.



Lost like 8 and drew 2 since then and still no derank. Been seeing some supremes tho so it may be time soon."

She doesn't know how she or this boy looks like, thus will never feed into the pressure of the modern body ideal.
