If you have draining shield, It may be less versatile than than TSoAL, but can afford you some extra protection from heavy hitters. (also, VERY ANNOYINGLY since it's a targeting effect, it doesn't stop Cocytus)

I love berg, but he's just sooooo bricky sometimes. Even with Rose lover, it's just not quick enough for some of these Meta decks.  Synchro Rosemary is a pretty reliable summon with Akiza's ""What Grow's in the graveyard"" skill and Naturia Rosewhip.  

To add on that to u/HeatedPolkka's comment Re; the Parshath engine, Running Three Rebirth of Parshath with a couple Debunks makes it somewhat reliable. Rebirth is an easy farm as it's just an R, and you can score a couple of Avenging Knights with UR tickets. Debunk I find to be somewhat useful with dealing with Darklords or Shiranui opening plays. 

I haven't had a chance to test a deck with Angelica, but I'm going to try a deck idea with a ""That Grass Looks Greener"" strategy. I'll make a post about it if it's any good.

I'd known this girl for months and had been crushing on her since the first day I met her at my community college. We met in the student union and she kicked my ass at Guitar Hero. Turns out we were both very into games, anime, and sci-fi.  We had a friend group in the college and we saw a lot of each other. After a couple weeks of messaging on MySpace and a ton of self-doubt, I decided to bite the bullet and ask her out to a movie.

When I tried calling her my hand was trembling so hard, I could barely even press the dial button on my cell. I tried practicing the words in front of a mirror, but I just ended up stammering every syllable. I don't think I had ever felt that sort of fear in my bones before or since then.

I did the only thing that felt reasonable at the time. I grabbed my Mp3 player, went into my backyard, and played [You're The Best Around (AKA the montage song from Karate Kid)](https://youtu.be/oomCIXGzsR0?t=33)on repeat at least 15 times, while busting out sweet Karate moves. ( I do not practice any sort of martial art)

I don't know if it was the lyrics that pumped me up, or the pantomiming of kicking ass, I was able to finally call her. She said yes and we went out for Chinese food and a viewing of Step Brothers.

Anytime I'm ever remotely nervous about anything, I load up the song and give it a listen or 15, cause it actually does make me feel like the best around."

You seem kinda down on yourself. I get it. I was pretty much in the same boat you were in at your age. I decided to change myself. I'm 30 now, and I'm still a dork. But I'm a dork that occasionally goes on dates 'n' stuff and I'm doing it at a frequency I'm happy with.

If you need a start, here's something to think about. What are your interests? strengths? The qualities you like about yourself? If dating is a game of poker, these are the cards you have been dealt with. And even a crummy hand can win a big pot. In my opinion, learning what you like about yourself and putting THAT best possible version of yourself forward is the most important thing you can learn to do.

As far as the technical stuff, like flirting, that comes with repetition. You're probably gonna be no good at it for a while before your ok at it. But that's OK. you'll get there. You're still young. If you need a boost, I really like the [Art of Charm podcast's Toolbox Series](https://theartofcharm.com/category/toolbox-episodes/). In fact, all of AoC is great on taking these intangible qualities of dating like ""banter"" and ""rapport"" and really breaks them down for dummies like us. 

Their motto is to ""leave everything and everyone better than you found them."" You seem like you're a good guy. I hope you find the skills to let everyone know you're a great one. Cheers."
