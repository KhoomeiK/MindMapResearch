Just don‚Äôt ever ask for advice from people who don‚Äôt have their own futures worked out. But it‚Äôs true... I didn‚Äôt know what I wanted because I disliked myself anyway. 

I could‚Äôve been a happy sunflower blooming in the summer breeze if I‚Äôd made the decision to trust myself. But a disapproving look from my father made me feel small enough to listen. So stupid. But yes, it‚Äôs no body‚Äôs but my own fault.

I‚Äôm in my late 20s and have made no money or made much progress towards my future at all. I‚Äôm getting my masters degree. But I kept getting sick and losing my financial stability. I don‚Äôt feel like I have a future anymore, but I‚Äôm happy you think I still have a chance."

Journalism is dying because the model needs to change. Good journalism is as important to democracy as democracy itself. No one has freedom without freedom of information.

It‚Äôs my hope to eventually help aide in the reconstruction of journalism as an essential part of society and return it to its status as a respectable profession based on facts and nobility.

It really seems like the world is only made for the wealthy, wherever you are.

Been wanting to live abroad but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs possible. If I were able to do it maybe I could manage to get medical care."
SuicideWatch,fl0z5ik,t1_fkzevc6,1584718809.0,"Of course it‚Äôs not heaven on earth. But I would be able to get my body fixed and continue my education. Do you live in America? People go bankrupt just because they have to take an ambulance to a hospital, which is $4000 per ride. And schooling can be impossible to pay for, at $5,000 per semester at least. 

The programs in Europe are so cheap it‚Äôs unbelievable. One MA program I looked in Germany at was ‚Ç¨300/semester. Excuse me?!?! I could‚Äôve paid my way without taking loans. And medical treatment is not only better but affordable, even for foreigners 

I‚Äôd love to go to Europe, but I‚Äôm not sure if I could pay my current loans, still. Or how I could get there. Maybe it is possible? Again, the problem has always been money. 

I‚Äôm not trying be a downer, just being realistic. Unless you know of a way for poor people to get there?"

RadicalChristianity,fkuh0rv,t1_fku8may,1584549268.0,"As far as I‚Äôm aware, we will be given new spiritual bodies to match our different state of being.

I like to think these bodies will evolve with us as we grow in our understanding of God, and we become more like Him for all of eternity.

Not sure if there‚Äôs proof of that but it makes sense to me."
SuicideWatch,fkswfx2,t3_fki4ls,1584500003.0,"If you‚Äôre still here... well, I‚Äôm happy you are. If you‚Äôre gone and there‚Äôs another side, I hope you‚Äôre finally getting the love you‚Äôve always needed. Good luck, friend."
SuicideWatch,fksvvht,t1_fksqwy3,1584499617.0,"Yeah, well it sucks that when we die, we won‚Äôt have any freedom or justice either. No love, no joy... Don‚Äôt you wish you got to experience those things? Don‚Äôt you wish you got to feel loved and got the chance to experience LIFE, the way some people can on earth? 

The concept of suicide is so freeing and so terrifying because at one point you‚Äôre saving yourself from more misery, but at another you‚Äôre closing yourself off to the possibility of finally being alive for once. 

That‚Äôs why we wish a good god was real. To be wrapped in love forever... what a thought."

insaneparents,fknhwtb,t3_fjfi5s,1584366161.0,"These people really shouldn‚Äôt even be parents. My mother would ALWAYS tell me I was crying for attention, and would mock me even though my bladder didn‚Äôt work all throughout my childhood and into college. Just found out at 26 that my neck vertebrae were twisted and it was slowly killing me and preventing nerve signals from going to my sacral nerves. So happy we had to wait until I was not on their insurance anymore! Yay!

She works with children in an elementary school for some reason. Seems to love taking care of kids that aren‚Äôt her own."
SuicideWatch,fkl249d,t3_filats,1584296839.0,"Hi, Jnovuse. I‚Äôm sure a lot of people here understand what you‚Äôre trying to say, and you‚Äôre trying to be helpful.

I have to ask you though: have you considered WHY your sister took her own life? You say it was pointless and it inflicted her family in tragedy, but what do you know from her perspective?

Nobody truly WANTS to see suicide as the only option. Suicide is what happens when someone is sick or neglected for so long and there‚Äôs truly no way out. I also mean no disrespect for you or your family, but if your sister needed help and did not receive it, was it really her responsibility to continue living in unimaginable agony to prop up the feelings of others?

Here‚Äôs my dilemma: I have been ill with a neurological illness my entire life, likely caused by an early childhood injury. The evidence of this illness was obvious, and I had no control over my bladder since I was a toddler. Instead of my relatively well-off family fighting for my treatment and taking me to  as many doctors as needed, I was ridiculed, mocked and told I was ‚Äúweird‚Äù and ‚Äúweak.‚Äù

Do you think I was able to make friends or have a normal social life at all? No, and I was treated the same way or worse at home. I studied hard, got good grades, but after college it didn‚Äôt matter. I could not keep a job because of my very embarrassing illness. 

Instead of my family seeking treatment, I am ALWAYS told to shut up and ‚Äúbe happy.‚Äù Can you imagine living in such torment? Can you imagine being 27, with no money, no way to pay for surgery, no way to live your dreams, no friends and no way to make them, and no future whatsoever? Can you imagine being stuck like this, with no help and no option for help, and every day gets harder and harder?

Getting better and changing your life requires a certain amount of income and autonomy. Without these things, it might be more compassionate to let someone kill themselves and end their misery. It‚Äôs like asking someone to keep smiling when their body is their own torture chamber. 

Please don‚Äôt blame your sister because depression took her life. It‚Äôs more accurate to say that depression took her life."
SuicideWatch,fkkzj8w,t3_five50,1584295258.0,"I understand. Belief in God have me a brief feeling of resurgence during undergrad, in which I believed I‚Äôd be safely taken care of by a benevolent spirit. Then my physical and mental illnesses got in the way and annihilated my job prospects. I worked so hard to get through college and get accepted into grad school, only to fall apart and have no jobs or nothing to show for it. 

I just want to go home to God. I‚Äôm so tired of living."
