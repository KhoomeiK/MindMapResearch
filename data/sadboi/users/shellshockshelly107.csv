The speed limit on the road was 50 MPH which was kind of fast, but I saw an old man walking on the side of the road in the dark. I thought it was really weird to see an old person walking down this really creepy road at night. After about a minute passed from seeing the man on the road, I was curious to see if the man was actually still there. I turned my Jeep around and drove the opposite way back down the road to find the old man. I couldn’t find him. He either oddly wandered into the woods or I had a paranormal encounter on this road."

I used to date a guy that admittingly came from a low income family. For a whole year, I’ve been financially helping out his family to make sure they were affording money, essentials, having a good holiday (like Christmas), etc. I have spent thousands and thousands helping him and his family out. They were extremely nice people and were appreciative of everything I have done. 

My ex is depressed and also autistic so his emotions can get a little strong at times. I was always there for him during his darkest moments, his worries, his break downs, etc. I’ve even left work and college early to be with him during these type of emergencies. 

It turns out he has a new lady friend he has been talking to. I was constantly questioning who this girl was and he always told me “Shes just a friend” 

We have broken up now and guess who he immediately went to? The girl. 

Thousands and thousands of dollars wasted on this clown. It makes me seriously sick to reflect on this. He pushed me away and shut me out like I’ve never done a goddamn thing.
