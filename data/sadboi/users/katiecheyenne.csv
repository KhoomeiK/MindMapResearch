I’ve heard the theory with dogs that you shouldn’t let them get bonded before they are bonded to you, But I think that’s for serious working dogs. I think your concerns are unfounded in this situation. It sounds like everything is going completely normally and perfectly at this point.
It’s normal for cats to hide the first two weeks!
Give them a year or two, and then see where they’re at."

I’m surprise people here are telling you what to feel and what not to feel. It annoys me when I hear people talk about feeling blessed. The word blessed reminds me of church, so I get a little stab feeling in my heart when I hear it, it’s not the same as fortunate. It makes them sound silly.

Finally I got her to a normal weight and I can tell she’s much happier. She still begging for food but she knows she only gets it at mealtime so it has worked out. I hope you’re able to get strict about how much food she gets, it will help her in the long run."
