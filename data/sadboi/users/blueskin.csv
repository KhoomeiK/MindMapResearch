battlebots,fr58gf1,t1_fr55yua,1589904326.0,"The pit was overused, 100% agreed.

Fog of War and Rogue House Robot were badly thought out, but the flame pit and floor flipper/spikes were balanced enough (and the floor spikes were eventually disabled as they kept breaking). The floor flipper could have been better *designed* though.

As for the house robots, they had a lot more freedom to do damage in the original series but I think were generally kept to a reasonable level in seasons 8-10. One of the reasons they *need* to be there is safety, in that they would be used to pin an out of control robot against the wall (the reason that when there was a big spinner, Sir Killalot or Shunt were always used as they are the most heavily armoured (possibly of any combat robot in general?)).

In terms of the Battlebots arena, I think the screws serve largely the same purpose as the pit, it's an instant elimination if driven well, but they get the balance of ""difficulty to use"" better than the pit did. The killsaws seem to do nothing but ruin promising battles when one robot gets stuck in the slot, on the other hand."
