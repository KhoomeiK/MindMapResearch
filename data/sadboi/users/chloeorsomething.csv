I feel like there’s something bigger going on with that part of the park"
CrypticPark,fm9xx0y,t1_fm3ij5b,1585879072.0,"I actually have a theory that the pretenders were “turned” in the eras their parts of the park are set in based on the degradation of their humanity. I saw a theory that Mr. Scratch *was* originally a dog, and either way his costume and the nurse’s head/jaw trauma both prevent them from speaking. They’re the newest pretenders and this may be to prevent them from talking. Next oldest are the Hollywood pretenders. They both act like they’re from the golden age of film and can still speak, but are unable to say what they want. Even older than them are the Twin Vale Point’s “original” pretenders (excluding Nathan). The Cowboy acts like he’s from the real old west. At this point he can’t even speak, only laugh. He also has a cleft lip as an adult, a birth defect commonly surgically repaired during infancy - in the modern day, at least. This theory is most convincingly backed up by the “ancient” wood handle revolver Leah found in Dale’s office that likely corresponds to the cowboy’s own bullet wounds. I think the stagecoach driver before Nathan may also have been an “original” pretender, and got either dangerous or inhuman enough that they had to be replaced. That leaves the Candyland pretenders. Neither speak, both are especially inhuman and dangerous. I think they’re either the oldest or something else entirely."
CrypticPark,fm5wian,t1_fm5molm,1585781390.0,"I could see that being the case. What with Dale getting so uncharacteristically kind right around Halloween, it’s like he feels bad about what he might have to do. I do have to wonder about the previous rituals, though - publicly humiliating poor Mitchell and do-si-doing hardly seem like common methods of demonic appeasement. I find it hard to believe Dale would close the park on Halloween night just to mess with his employees, though. Maybe the other “rituals” were just him keeping them all busy and on the premises so he has them on hand in case the night demands a sacrifice"
CrypticPark,fm5fy62,t1_fm59qkr,1585772218.0,"Oooh I like that theory a lot. It never hit me that Mr. Scratch might have been a dog - his behavior is definitely pretty canine so I can totally see it. The teeth bit makes a lot of sense too, I always just assumed they were stained from the black drool some of the pretenders seem to have"
CrypticPark,fm58z40,t3_fswuio,1585768528.0,"This one might be kind of off the wall, but I have a feeling the pretenders, or at least a good deal of them, were turned in the era their section of the park is set in.

Nathan is an obvious exception, but his case makes it clear that not-actors lose more and more of their humanity with time. I think it’s also stated that he looks a bit younger than Dale even though they went to school together, which may mean the pretenders cease to age.

The most recent area of the park, and thus the one that *should* have the newest pretenders, would be the horror section. If so, then why can neither of the pretenders speak? I think that may be intentional. The nurse has head trauma and half a jaw. Mr. Scratch is sealed inside a costume with no opposable thumbs and a nonhuman mouth. If Dale’s family wanted to keep new pretenders from getting the truth out to employees, he found a good way to do it.

The next section is the Hollywood section, featuring the only two old pretenders that can still speak. They still have the manner and talent of an aging diva and a concert pianist pulled straight from the golden age of film. By this point, the park hasn’t taken their ability to “speak,” but it has taken their ability to communicate freely. The diva, at the very least, has still showcased the ability to feel.

Next is Twin Vale Point, and the reason I came up with this theory. Our cowboy always seemed the most “frozen in time” to me. Besides his old fashioned mannerisms and his constant laughing, there was something about him that struck me as odd from the very beginning. “Harelip,” or cleft lip, is often surgically repaired in infancy in most developed countries, yet he has one well into adulthood. It’s certainly possible he didn’t have access to medical care throughout his life, but it’s also possible he’s from a time when such facial surgery simply wasn’t as commonplace. There’s also the matter of the “ancient” wood handle revolver Leah found in Dale’s office. I think it corresponds to him. I think it was used to shoot him, and I think he’s similarly “ancient.” And what of the stagecoach? I still don’t think the stagecoach itself is the pretender. I think there was an original pretender there before Nathan - another one from the age of the Wild West. And I think something bad happened to them. I think with age, they either broke down somehow or became horribly dangerous and had to be replaced.

That leaves Candyland. I think the mime and the sugar plum fairy are either the oldest, from some kind of Hansel and Gretel situation, or something entirely different. Neither can speak, both are dangerous. Candyland hasn’t been explored much yet in the story and I think there’s something much, much bigger going on there."

I can’t stop thinking about those rotten bullet holes in the Laughing Cowboy’s chest, and I think that might just be the gun that put them there.

For a while I stopped seeing myself as an actual person as opposed to a worthless remnant of one, and I used this mindset to justify repeatedly sacrificing my own mental health to help others. 

Things have gotten a bit better - I now know when to take a step back and let myself recover"

NDE,er6z3gw,t3_c0psif,1560561836.0,"I told only my sister, in very vague terms. I left it at “the doctors gave me too high a dose of medication, I think I almost died.” She was terrified for me. I tried to play it off as something that didn’t matter in the long run and emphasized that I’m still here. I didn’t delve into the graphic details, how it felt or the state it left me in. I didn’t tell my parents about it at all, and I don’t think I ever will. My NDE happened in a hospital they booked me in and I’m sure they would feel at fault."
