The Titans are hoes. On them we shall stunt.  

2 points:  

1. The Titans beat the Patriots in Foxbourough. A Patriots team that was slumping, limped into the playoffs, and lost to a legit bottom 3 team in the league (The Dolphins, also hoes) at home, in a game that could have won them a potential bye.  

2. Yes Derrick Henry is a good, bruising style RB. I ask you what good is a game manager RB when you are down 3 TDs?? Tannehill will be forced to throw against a secondary that has 2 ALL PRO CBs.  

We are going to destroy the Titans. Our offensive is a fucking buzzsaw. Our defense is stacked and hungry. Lamar is playing better than Jesus right now.
