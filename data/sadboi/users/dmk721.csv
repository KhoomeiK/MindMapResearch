adhdwomen,fqyln9o,t3_glku8n,1589750601.0,I am a narc magnet.  I attract abusers over and over!  I wear my heart on my sleeve and truly think people have good intentions and are being honest with me when they actually aren’t.  I’m a people pleaser and a giver so I often get taken advantage of by manipulators.  I’m just now learning all of this at my age (44) and learning the red flags and trying to learn how to trust my intuition.  It’s really hard for me because I always second guess myself.

I’m 44, I don’t have underlying conditions that I know of but I have histamine intolerance which really causes my immune system to overreact so I’m scared of cytokine storm.  Okay so what I do is stay away from mainstream media.  Only read positive news on the virus.  Focus on what you can control, staying inside, cleaning, social distancing, wearing a mask if you need to go in public etc.  Limiting social media helped a lot.  I am just really trying to live in the now.  I’ve been taking vitamin D3 and trying to eat healthy.  I wish I could make my boyfriend care but he won’t.  So I just pray that I’ll stay healthy.  I have a 7yr old and he is my world.  The anxiety sub has an amazing thread, the good news only coronavirus thread.  Join!  It has helped me immensely.

Recently with the virus, I started having panic attacks again.  I know a low dose of Xanax (or probably any benzo) will work for me and I can’t seem to get it prescribed.  I am 44.  I am not seeking drugs to get high!  A very low dose will work for me and I just need a small prescription to have in hand for panic attacks.  The docs will not prescribe a benzo, I am not specifically asking for one either so I’m having to try all of these other meds.  I’ve tried buspar (which I do take 3x a day but doesn’t work for panic), hydroxzyine-doesn’t work for panic attacks, and clonidine-actually gave me a panic attack!  I have another telehealth appt next week and I’m super nervous about it.  I’ve asked for a rescue medication for when I have panic attacks and the two they had me try don’t cut it.

It was VERY validating and I was so glad that I did it.  He had told me she was awful and had left him while at work without saying goodbye and I just couldn’t understand how someone could do that UNTIL I lived through my experience.  She told me she had tried to leave so many times and he would manipulate her to stay (exactly what he did to me) so she had to escape while he was at work!

I put my hair in a bun.  I wore a jacket, I had my cards in one pocket, and hand sanitizer in another.  I went as early as I could go.  I had to go on Saturday.  It was much busier than i was comfortable with so if you are able to go early during the week, I recommend that!  I tried to keep my distance but others were not as careful.  I got everything on my list as fast as possible.  When I checked out, I removed my gloves.  I got my card out (hands clean) and paid and then used hand sanitizer.  When I got to my car, I removed my jacket.  I used hand sanitizer again.  Put groceries away.  Hand sanitizer again lol.  I change my clothes and washed really good when I got home.  I always sanitize my food packaging, so I did that after.  I was very scared to do it, but also I felt better after.  I conquered a fear!  I’ve been using instacart or curbside pickup but I needed to use my EBT card so I had no choice to go in the store Saturday.  You’ve got this.  Just be aware of your surroundings, stick to your list, bring your card and hand sanitizer, and don’t touch your face.  Any mask will do, make one if you need to!  Good luck!"
