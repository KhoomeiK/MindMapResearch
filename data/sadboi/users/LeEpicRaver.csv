People are fuckin assholes
They don’t know when to step back. 
They don’t know when other people are feeling bad.
They don’t know how to talk.
They don’t fucking understand!
Take my mum for example. Let’s use her. Ohhhh have you decided???? Blah blah blah... WHY DOES SHE TALK SO OFTEN IN THAT LITTLE DICK VOICE OF HERS?
She just says “oh yeah come talk to me” but whenever I do she never comprehends and is always so opinionated instead of bothering to listen. Can’t wait to leave. She is always ready to argue and never stops to hear another side of the story, little prick pessimist. 
About my dad? No, no no. He lip smacks just to bother me, always forgets about how others feel. He makes me feel like everyone’s problems are on me. It’s my fault. Puts me in fucking mental and physical pain just for a laugh because he doesn’t realize how I feel. Doesn’t bother.
My brother, now.
He actually sorta cares but he’s a prick and is never sorry for his mistakes

And if anyone’s reading this, they’re probably laughing. They’ve probably already found out about my misophonia and every trigger of mine. It’s okay, I’m used to the loss of trust. Nobody understanding, caring... or believing me. Seriously, feels like a lot of betrayal when you don’t think I’m telling you the truth when I’m really telling you how I actually feel. It makes me really sad when I’m trying to tell you how much of a struggle it is for me. And then... I feel better. I told someone how I feel. But then I don’t. My hopes are crushed because you don’t even believe me. There’s nobody else to talk to anymore, leave it. But you... you probably don’t get understand.

So let me explain to you.

It all starts, with me waking up. Remembering another night from last night, where I hid away to cry again on my own, because there’s nobody to talk to about it. You may think „oh she can talk to me” but no. Never can I talk to you. Always so opinionated and argumentative makes it impossible. The loss of trust. Oh... there wasn’t any trust in the first place. It would be impossible, I can’t risk talking to anyone about it. Don’t get me wrong, if there were no risks I would gladly take up the offer. If there were no catches. But having people find out how I feel and everything...no, I can’t. I can’t. After another one of those morning moments, I don’t really feel much zeal or excitement for the day, as it’s usually just people making me want to fucking die already over and over again with their normal stuff because I have to keep all of this inside of me. But I get up anyway. I don’t know why I get up, but I do. There’s a sort of fear, it seems. I’m not yet going to go into that. So I get up, and I can already hear stuff. My mom talking in that high pitched bloody voice of hers that makes me rather scratch my ears off slowly than hear her. The shuffle of her huge feet... ugh. Ugly. And so many sounds. My brother scrambling around. My dad like snoring or something. It’s already too much, it’s an overload of sounds that make me want to up and die already. I can hear all of it. Seriously, if God can hear everything at once he must be on some serious sensory overload. So I get up and change. Oh god. The sound of the clothes moving. Right now I can hear my mum brush her teeth and it’s a scratching sound that seethes through the crack in my door, like knives coming out to cut up my ears. The sink. It’s like wshhhhhhh... It makes me want to cry so I have something else to listen to. There it goes again. “Ohhhh, don’t Focus on the Sounds.” They say. It might be easy for an ignorant bitch like you, but maybe not me. It’s so easy. Sureeeeeee. So I go to brush my teeth. More scratchy sounds. And yet, I am still reminded of the secret, the hope that is there. Of course, since there’s someone reading this I cannot say this because it’s a secret that can only be let out in maybe... 6-10 years or so? Maybe even up to 20. But for a secret like the one I have, it’s worth it, it gives so much hope that fills me with happiness throughout my entire body. A burst of energy, you could say. I finish getting ready. And... although I’m ready on the outside, I’m not yet ready in the inside for the thing that yet comes. Downstairs, yes, I MUST eat breakfast. No, I’m not hungry. But no, how I feel still doesn’t matter. It never will, maybe until 6 years later. OH FUCK, SHE CALLS MY NAME IN HER UGLY TONED VOICE STRONGLY. It’s so loud and penetrates my ears like little bullets. And then, she takes a bite into her food. I can hear it loud and clear. Her mouth moves forward and backward, her jaw crushing and grinding it up into little pieces. Moves left, no no, back, then her tongue points at it. Goes right, then scratches all the way down her throat with a slurping sound. And again, and again. Again. Again, again again again again again again AGAIN. Oh... it’s finally done. But now, she goes to sip her coffee. You can imagine how that goes. And my dad comes in. Takes a bite. But no. He’s forgotten how I feel. So takes a bite, his lips latching on to the very edge of the toast, and his teeth cutting into it. Then... fucking lip smacks. His lips bring it forward, down and his tongue moves onto it. Teeth still on, his lips start like... smacking together. Like, what the fuck??? Does that make it taste better? Some people with actual dignity say no. No. And it goes on, on, on. Ages, it seems. My brother actually isn’t that bad, except for trying to make everyone pity him. Little sorry Party he’s throwing himself over there. Literal quote, “No, I don’t have time for anything anymore! Nobody listens! No! I have so much work, just leave me,           p l e a s e!” Yeah bro, if only that were true. Pleaseeeeee. Ppppllllleeeeeaasssse. Well, can’t take it, finish quickly and run upstairs, yet reminded of my secret again. How many more times can I be reminded until I snap? I don’t know. But I know it’ll happen. Probably, soon. Still, though, not yet. Maybe I have school, maybe I don’t. Hoping nobody’s reading this."
