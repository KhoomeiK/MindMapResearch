u/not-a-maarite is right, I’m pretty sure; but I’d like to add that it’s good to know these terms are somewhat contextual in their usage. That a system could be authoritative, centralized-government communism, or it could be decentralized to the max as in anarcho-communism.

PoliticalCompassMemes,fqgccso,t1_fqg3br0,1589342750.0,"If I understand it from that specific perspective, (please, *please* someone correct me, I’m still trying to figure this stuff out)

“Communism” by definition of being “communal living” where everyone is equal: obviously hasn’t been tried beyond maybe a tribe or two in human history. (so like, anarcho-communism? maybe?)

“Socialism” as defined by “collective ownership of the means of production” hasn’t been tried, as the so-called “socialist” states that *have* existed were far too authoritarian to guarantee *collective* ownership. More like, the opposite. (so, democratic socialism? which I belive is what I’d argue for)

But of course, here in America “communism” means Stalinism/Maoism (those the terms, right?) and “socialism”...well, can mean either the same thing, or “everyone is of equal wealth”, which as far as I know is a concept only argued for by niche areas of the compass.

Now there’s two tangents I can go off of here, but I won’t go too far; instead I’ll just acknowledge them:

 1- Robert E Lee was *supposedly* a “decent” and “ethical” man who, uh, owned slaves? “It’s the times though” whatever I won’t go into that. 

2- other instances of this happen all the time, history is brutal: yeah of course, but if there’s a particular instance where a group of people feel uncomfortable that an establishment—in this case a city that once put up a statue and the keeps it up—is essentially letting the immorality it once stood for to cast its shadow on the present “because it’s art”...well, by all means, it’s just a fucking statue, take it down. Keep the history books, of course. But a statue glorifies, so what’s the point of leaving it up?

Also I find it ironic that—generalizing here of course—the same group of people who laugh and scoff at abstract art as “anyone can do that, that’s not art”, will defend art that represents glorification of immorality, just in the name of “well duh it’s history of course keep it”. So clearly this group doesn’t care about art for art’s sake, yet that’s their argument.
