Aquariums,fq6g02c,t1_fq655s6,1589130792.0,"Personally I love duckweed but a lot of people hate that it gets stuck in equipment cause its so small, and it needs to be culled really often because it grows fast. I've you d that using a floating ring (I just made one out of bendy straws) helps keep the duckweed and other floaters out of the stream of my filter, and so they don't get pushed under and into my filter. I also keep some silvinia and frogbit which are a little bigger, and less overwhelming than duckweed. In general larger sized floaters wont get in equipment or be as messy as smaller ones. If you look on r/aquaswap a lot of people give away and sell floaters"
Aquariums,fq0z5es,t3_gghjet,1589039496.0,"Tetra are schooling fish, so your one guy is probably very lonely. I would start by getting them more glofish tetra friends (they can be any color but they have to be glofish tetras so they will school together), so you have a group of 5 or 6. They should fit fine in a 10 gallon. To help control algae and left over fish food, I would opt for a small algae eater like a nerite snail or some shrimp. I have a 10 gallon with a school of 5 tetras and a nerite snail and it seems to be plenty full of fish, so I wouldn't overstock your tank much more than that. As far as plants, you'll want to think about your substrate first. If you want to keep sand or gravel, there are some plants that prefer to be attached to a rock or a piece of wood or something so that their roots are exposed, like java fern. If you would like other plants that require substrate, you'll need to take your fish out and put him in a temporary tank so you can change the substrate. You can also easily add moss balls or floating plants to your tank without having to do anything. For any plants I recommend getting a plant aquarium light, which should have white, blue and red spectrums, and experiment with how long you need to turn it on during the day (may be less if your tank gets natural sunlight). Overall, an algae eater, more live plants and less light (but still enough for you plants, so experiment) will help control algae and your glofish tetra will be much happier with a school or friends :) good luck!"

fishtank,fpvehk6,t3_gfsmze,1588942948.0,"You can try reducing the light and seeing if that helps. I also like to keep a nerite snail or a mystery snail in my tanks to help eat algae, or if you have room you can opt for a larger algae eater. Having live plants in a tank also helps control algae, especially floating plants, since they help block the light and absorb nutrients in the water that the algae likes. Sometimes a very sudden growth spurt of algae can signal that there has been some recent imbalance in the water, especially nitrogen spikes, but regular algae growth is normal and can normally be kept under control by limiting lighting"
Aquariums,fps664z,t3_gf81mq,1588868125.0,"I second the other comments that this is food. I also tend to be an over feeder and I've found that including a bottom feeder in each of my tanks really helps a lot. Nerite snails and mystery snails are my personal favorite clean up pals because they eat old fish food and algae and help me control both. Definitely clean and treat your tank in the meantime until the water clears up and your fish start doing better, but if you have room in your tank this might help in the long run."

The fish on its own can be a beautiful image and will be appreciated by fishers and hikers and campers and others attending your area as well. The fish drawing looks alright, but I would also consider working in some flashier colors to the design since this is promotional, if not in the fish itself maybe a bright colored background or outline (I think an electric blue would look nice with the color scheme you have and would make sense, and help the image stand out)."
