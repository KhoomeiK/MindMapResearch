Wow.  Relationship-wise, if I had to sum up my last 5 years, it would be what you just wrote.  Creepy.  But now we know there are at least 2 us who feel this way!

I don't think it's asking too much to have a few friends that actually reciprocate the effort it takes to make and maintain the relationship.  We shouldn't be the only ones to reach out first, to ask how the other is doing, to listen to the answer, and offer advice.  One way friendships have left me feeling empty and frustrated.  So, I get it.  

I, too, have wondered what I'm doing wrong.  5 years ago I moved back to my home town and got back together with my old friends after having lived in a different state for 12 years.  I loved my friends.  But during my time away, I learned what constituted abusive or toxic behavior.  I was shocked when I realized that two of them were (and always had been) bullies to me and that another one was legit abusive.  I decided I didn't want that in my life and distanced myself from those relationships.  

Another friend was now a father of 3 small children and wasn't allowed out without either his wife or the kids.  The last one was getting sucked into a cult and would only get together with me if we attended a cult function.  

So...yeah, no more friends.  

I didn't realize it would be so hard to make new ones.  I know what it's like to put in the effort only to be ghosted or to end up the one making all the effort.  It sucks.  

I wish I had the answer.  I guess we just have to keep trying."

When I worked in a corporate setting, hyperbole got me sent to freakin HR more times than I can count. 

I still can't believe how so many people didn't realize that's what I was doing and thought I was actually serious. And thinking I was serious actually warranted a call to Human Resources.  

You know that eye roll emoji? That's based on MY FACE."
technews,figlgma,t1_fig15xj,1582401058.0,Very good point. We all need to be a bit more discerning of our information sources these days.
addiction,fhydjcy,t1_fhrkf47,1581973738.0,"Yup. Hippa is great. It protects our medical information.  And if you take a real hard look at all those papers you have to sign everywhere, for things not even related, you would realize there is a war on hippa.

I had to sign my privacy away to get the oxygen machine I have to wear at night to stay alive.  Sure, I didn't HAVE to sign, but I was sick, I wasn't thinking clearly from being hypoxic for 6 months, and I don't have any money for a lawyer or to buy my own breathing machine.  I could have fought it/found another way to get it/whatever else people with money and time do to get what they need,  BUT I WASNT GETTING ENOUGH OXYGEN AND NEEDED THE OXYGEN MACHINE. 

And most people don't even read the paperwork. Honestly? I wish I never did. I'd rather be blissfully ignorant because there isn't a damn thing I can do about it. 

So hippa? Yeah, it's great...until you sign away your rights by accident (cuz you didn't read it) or because you needed some medical service to stay alive and they won't give it to you until you ""sign those papers and we'll get it right out to you."" 

So, read everything and realize your medical data is worth a lot of money."

Things are tightening up. If you fill a prescription for opiates in Massachusetts, that info goes into a computer program that is shared by more states every year. It won't stay your secret very long."
addiction,fhyak99,t1_fhy7wb7,1581972005.0,"Building on this angle, you said you have no friends (me either), but that you're in college, right?  So, if you have a clean slate now (no buddies that are addicts or alcoholics that you have to break contact with to stay sober) and you want to fill your days with things that you like to do to take your mind off drinking, maybe you could focus on finding new friends that have similar interests or hobbies.  

You could kill 2 birds with 1 stone. You'll be taking your mind off drinking, doing fun stuff, and have a support network of buddies who aren't going to drag you out every night to drink. 

Groups like meetup.org have interest-based get togethers and tons of different hobbies you can check out to see where you feel comfortable.  I met 2 friends on Scout.  If you aren't going to AA, that might be the best place to start off. Almost everyone there is trying to rebuild a life and find healthy things to fill their time with.

Good luck. You've already done the hardest part."
addiction,fhrdgtd,t3_f4fhjf,1581823491.0,"If people go to Detox/Rehab or an out-patient clinic for an addiction or dependency, it will be in their medical file forever. They will never be treated the same way by the medical establishment.

After a major surgery, they will be sent home without any painkillers, even if they have never abused Opiates.

If they have ADHD, they will be taken off the meds that keep their symptoms in check, even if they have never abused Amphetamines.

If they have an Anxiety Disorder, they will be taken off the meds that help them function, even if they have never abused Benzodiazepines.

Sometimes it's a tough call for people because, for the rest of their life, their doctor will see 'an Addict' before they see 'a patient with a broken leg', and treat them like a 'lying drugseeker' and not 'a suffering sick person'."

It's slowly starting to change in Massachusetts.  A group of volunteers used to walk around Boston handing Narcan out. When they started, it was a felony if they got caught. They risked it to save people who didn't need to die. Now they are authorized to do it."

After I posted this, it dawned on me to Google it. 

I've yelled at people for asking without googling. I won't yell anymore LOL."

All I can I think of is they collect what we backup and pilfer our data?"
technews,fhccood,t1_fgptt4r,1581460723.0,"It's typical for people to care about other people's struggles, even people who are a different nationality, color, religion.   

Also, the people of Country X are not necessarily the government of Country X.  Don't judge a population by the actions of its government.   

This is pretty basic stuff.  I really hope you're like 12 and still have time to develop basic empathy and compassion.  If not, you might want to consider getting into politics."
