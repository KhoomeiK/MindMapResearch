exmoteens,few3gp4,t3_eoopv9,1579404810.0,"Disclaimer
I’m realizing as I type this I have a LOT to say, but I can’t really help it. It’s somewhat therapeutic just thinking about all the shit they did to me, and putting it into word. And I use “quorum” throughout just to mean group, unless I say a specific title of a quorum. and I like run-on sentences.

I’ve never believed in the church, but I didn’t realize it until sometime during the last 3 years I think? It’s more of a process than a certain moment or event in my life, but I’ll think of moments. I never really wanted to participate in anything church-related. When I was 8, I didn’t want to be baptized, when I was 11, I hated going to scout activities, when I was 12, I hated doing deacon activities, when I was 15, I hated going to church as much as I did when I was 8. I just felt a tremendous sense of not belonging. It was to the point where other people in my church’s deacons quorum, having clearly been instructed by one of the members of the bishopric (whether it was in a prior them-only meeting or what) had been trying to get me to go to all of their scout activities, talking to me like I’ve been friends with them all my life, even though those were the only times I would ever talk to those people. I’m a fan of basketball and football, and I LOVE college basketball, and 2 years ago, I was effectively cornered in my own home by members of the bishopric as they asked me to do all the scoring for everybody’s “march madness” NCAA tournament brackets, basically forcing me to be involved with the church and everybody in it, having to go every sunday to report the scores. This is a long-winded way of saying I was never really mormon.

Another event that may have influenced my leaving the church happens bi-annually, the meetings between the bishop and the deacon, teacher, etc. Somehow, I was always able to overlook the “chastity” questions, knowing full well I’d been jacking off about every 2 days. I’m a teenager, he probably knows full well every boy he asks jerks off, too. Something that stuck with me though was when we got to the topic of my family once. We were talking about something, and he asked something about my mom and dad. My dad passed away during the Iraq War in Hawijah, Iraq, on February 22, 2006, my 3rd birthday. I have no memories of him, which is something that as I write it, I wonder if I’ve repressed like it doesn’t bother me, but it does. My mom married my step-dad, Nate, 2 years later, and I’ve always just called him Nate, probably at first because I didn’t know who the guy was and wasn’t comfortable calling him dad, but now he’s just Nate to me (even though I have personal issues with him). I mention all this because nobody I’d ever talked to at church had called him my dad even formally, it was either “step-dad” or “Nate”. Instinctively, I corrected the bishop and said, “Actually, he’s my step-dad.” I felt stupid after saying it, because of course he would surely know, he’s the bishop. You’re smart, you probably put the pieces together a couple run-on sentences ago: The bishop had no idea he wasn’t my biological father. I told him what happened to my dad, he said, “Oh uh, my condolences”. That just really bothered me. You didn’t care enough about me to know about this intimate, yet obvious detail about my life? How could you possibly not know that yet? I don’t know. Probably dumb, but it stuck

On top of that, there’s the fact that I’m gay, and right now, there’s many mormons teaching, being taught, or having been taught that you choose to be gay. Spoiler alert, I don’t want to be gay, I’d love if it I was attracted to girls in my classes instead of guys, but it’s not possible and it won’t happen. I love basketball and football and video games and am introverted and socially awkward, wouldn’t it be weird if I decided to be gay just to stick out and be cool? Also, there’s the fact that the church pretends it accepts gay members the exact same way as everybody else, yet teaches that its a sin for a man to lie with another man. If you say being gay is okay, then why do you forbid those members from entertaining their sexuality in any way? It gets taught in seminary, and the kids seem to eat it up. Every guy at my school who isn’t homophobic, is probably gay or bisexual themselves. I thought it was just the teenage thing of saying gay, faggot, queer, etc a lot, the same way we use retard. Shit, I do it all the time, it doesn’t bother me. No, I found out they actually are homophobic.

Last year, soon after my 16th birthday, I was visited by the president in the teacher’s quorum to talk about whatever. Once he left, when it was time for dinner, i sat at the counter, and just fucking sobbed. I never cry. It was surreal. It was the culmination of everything I’d been feeling forever. I went to my room, and I cried into my mom’s shoulder, and since I was too tired from crying to even speak, I just texted her that I didn’t want to go to church anymore, and I wanted Nate to stay out of it. Despite thinking she would let me not go anymore, she looked me into my eyes and told me that going to church is just “what we do in this family.” Tomorrow morning, she forced me to come upstairs and talk with her and Nate about what I was feeling. I basically repeated what I said, not wanting to be bullied into submission. They asked me if I believed in the church, I said no. They asked if I didn’t believe in any of it, I said yes. I was furious and felt betrayed that my mom brought Nate into it, despite me asking her not to in the middle of a fucking mental breakdown in front of her. I started to cry again, asking why it was such a problem that I didn’t want to go to church anymore. They just stared at me, stone-faced. We finished, and my mom sent me a text, basically mocking me for thinking the church wasn’t true. “Where do you think your dad went?” She said. “Do you think he just fell off the face of the earth?” No. Dumbass. At the end of the text, she mentioned that God loved me no matter what. Nowhere in the text did she tell me that she loved me. Nor did she at the morning meeting, nor did Nate, and nor did she during the mental breakdown either. They’ve probably both forgotten any of that. I never will. I’ll never forget that and I’ll never forgive either of them for it. I didn’t fucking deserve that.

And then there’s just the little things I cant even think of on the spot and the split second memories that are hard to put into words. The combination of everything in my life in the church has led me to where I am now. I think I’m finally out for good. Eventually, my parents just stopped making me go to church. I haven’t in I think over half a year. Soon after I stopped, my brother did, too. When I move out, I plan to fully remove all my records from the church by any means necessary"
