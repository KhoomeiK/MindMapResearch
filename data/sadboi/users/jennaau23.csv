AusFinance,flfyaes,t3_fom12t,1585122652.0,"Just want to jump in before the barrage of criticism ensues about any bail outs. 

I'm a Qantas worker and no one has any idea of the scale Qantas has worked to get people, including foreigners, home. Planes went empty overseas because ever-changing rules meant any potential passenger wouldn't be let in, but they went anyway to bring people home. Flight attendants gave up their rest seats if it meant a seat for someone, and they even held a flight for the last few people who stood in line at Flight Centre for over an hour trying to re-route their itinerary to countries they were allowed to transit. Emirates and everyone else tells their passengers to go away they can't help; Qantas helps where they can, and before anyone starts on the long wait times for reservations on the phone, staff have dedicated their time at the airport to fielding the overflow of callers to help ease the queues. The SYD-LHR service (via Singapore) stopped in Darwin instead so that foreigners could still go home as Singapore closed their borders even for transit. THOUSANDS of people are trying to change their bookings and staff get abused at the airport because this particular person wasn't deserving to wait a bit. 

No, this doesn't 'entitle' Qantas to any government assistance in light of this or even make them deserving, but cut the bagging."
