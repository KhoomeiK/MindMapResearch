It’s very possible to switch from one to the other. Actually, I felt of all places, design school graduate level was very accepting of people coming in from different majors and fields. They viewed it as valuable outside perspective and sometimes if a topic came up in your field, they would be excited to hear what you thought about it.

One professor even dedicated a class to showing us different people’s work who had switched from STEM to Design and vice versa. It was to show how it’s possible and welcomed, and give real world examples.

The bad stuff: He doesn’t want to see your face or hear your voice, even though you’re long distance. On top of that he does t want to text or texts the bare minimum, even though it’s not texting itself because he contacts others. So he doesn’t want to communicate with you. He doesn’t spend much time with you when you visit, and he refuses to return the favor to you. He keeps secrets from you and refuses to acknowledge how that comes across as suspicious. And worst of all, he broke up with you to teach you a lesson for loving him and making him too high a priority in your life.

The good: he buys you expensive gifts.

He’s not just suspicious, he has quit his role as boyfriend completely. He doesn’t want to communicate, share things, confide in you, spend time with you, make you happy or show you respect. He seems to be capable of doing some of these things for other people, but for whatever reason he will not do those things for you.

Have you ever been to supermarkets in the United States? Ever notice the difference in the quality of products depending how rich or poor the neighborhood is? Supermarkets near lower income areas are filled to the brim with bad quality , unhealthy products. But that’s what was offered to them and all they can afford.

1. That you won’t treat her or him differently from now on. A big fear for the abused person, when confronted with a person who knows what’s going on, is that they will begin to treat their abuser differently. The abuser of course catches on and either forces them to cut the friend off or will raise hell until it happens.

2. That even if she comes to you and acknowledges he is abusive, that you won’t try to push her to leave before she’s ready.

That’s the tricky part. They’re scared as hell about leaving. Hence the whole mess they live in. So if they’re pushed out too soon, it can just be a relapse. But even if they acknowledge it and want to leave, they may not ever feel 100% ready. That’s still the fear talking. I would say in my experience in the past, after confiding in my family, I was maybe 90% ready. Then they kindly gave me the final (big) push."

Most people who love the show deny how boring it got at that point, but I’ll admit it’s just painful.

askwomenadvice,ff6v4p0,t3_ervjkl,1579635517.0,"I’m not familiar with this band, but i used to go to a lot of rock and metal concerts starting from high school.

I’ve learned it doesn’t always matter how heavy the music is to determine how rowdy a crowd will be. It depends on the city, the venue, the music type and the vice of choice for everyone in the crowd. Sounds overwhelming right? But actually it’s good news and bad news. Just because this might be a hard rock band, doesn’t mean the crowd will be jerks. They could be a chill crowd. But I’ve also seen the same band at different cities and venues, and it was two completely different experiences. 

You have to just keep an eye out. Rowdiness and pushing? Steer very clear of that. People are drinking like crazy? Rowdy. The smell of weed wafting immediately at the first sound of a guitar chord? A little less rowdy. Be on the safer side, if the area you’re standing in no longer feels comfortable, move.

If it’s outdoors, that’s pretty ideal. You can stand far back and enjoy the show from a comfortable distance. Don’t stand by the speakers if you want to ever hear again. They usually try to stop people, but keep a wary eye out for flying objects. It’s usually cups or bottles but just be on your guard.

Indoor concert, more tightly packed. Don’t be deceived by how the floor looks before the show starts or even after the opening band. When the headliner gets on stage, people really pack it in. They get excited for the first song and usually start swaying and dancing, so it’s hard to relocate at this point. If you get stuck, don’t panic. Stand your ground, use your elbows as slight spacers and *do not* be afraid to tap the person next to you and tell them to back off. After the song is over you have a little breathing room to relocate. But honestly, same advice here. When you’re alone, the back or sides are the safest. I usually try to go early enough and get a nice spot in the middle side area. 

Crowd surfers. Ugh. I know they’re having fun and I don’t judge that. But sometimes they can really kill it. Depends on the show. But beware of their flailing limbs and keep your arms up or make sure the taller person next to you has it covered. 

Don’t be afraid to chat with a group next to you if they seem friendly. If they know it’s your first concert ever, plenty would be happy to “adopt” you for a bit. At best, you’ll have some people to chat with for a while. At the very least, they could be friendly helpers if anyone gives you any trouble. 

Buy water at the beginning and stay hydrated. It will get hot and sweaty in there. 

Bring hearing protection. Even if it’s those little foam inserts. Plenty of people do it, you won’t look weird, and you’ll appreciate being able to hear afterward without a cacophony of bells ringing in your head.

As for meeting the band, take a deep breath and try to rehearse something you want to tell them. Despite going up there and performing, they might be shy too! Bring your sharpie and whatever thing you want to get signed. Or your camera ready. Your mind might be a little frazzled, so prepare yourself ahead of time so you don’t forget anything.

Overall, it’s a fun experience and people are usually there just trying to have fun. People in the crowd usually try to help one another out, but sometimes things get a little crazy. So never be afraid to ask security for help or stand near them if you feel anxious."

And when the jokes are at your expense, there’s situational vs. everyday life. For example, if your hair gets frizzy. Comments about how your hair is always a mess, you look like (insert unattractive character), giving you a nickname, or even affectionately commenting on your messy hair are all thinly veiled insults. Actual teasing would be “remember the way your hair looked that time you got hit with a wave at the beach?” It’s a funny moment you could both laugh at, without knocking what you always look like.

Sometimes it’s tough to tell where some people feel offended and where others can laugh about it. Some people will poke at their own fat and make a joke whereas some people would be hurt at even the slightest mention of body image. But that’s why you communicate. You can ask or if the other person tells you, you listen. Jokes are for the audience, not the comedian. If your audience doesn’t like the joke, you don’t keep saying the same joke unless you enjoy the sound of people booing you offstage. 

If you made these same jokes at him, would he be able to handle it? I don’t mean other people where he could put on a fake smile, I mean you. Or would he get defensive?

Otherwise they will definitely repeat the same behaviors, no matter how spectacular you are.

So he told you he had unstable relationships that only lasted a few months until now. The most promising thing was that he was going through therapy, but that also doesn’t always mean he has acknowledged and changed his issues.

Similar but different scenario. If someone told you “I have anger issues and I’ve taken it out on the people I love. I know it’s a problem.” It would be naive to think they would never do it to you. Doesn’t matter how special you are to them.

If someone tells you they have exhibited a pattern of behaviors, it doesn’t have to be only red flag or green flag, it can be a yellow flag. As long as the behavior isn’t an immediate dealbreaker, you have to proceed knowing full well they could repeat the behaviors with you.

I was not a fan of being the center or attention at all. But I hadn’t had a birthday party in years and around that time a ton of people were having sweet sixteens, so I really wanted to. I wanted it to be low key to save my parents some money and also ease the pressure on me since some party halls almost treated you like a bride sans groom.

Had it in my backyard. Tent, catered food, friend of a friend DJ, and one main activity. I only had a few close friends, so I also invited a lot of less close friends and acquaintances to cast a wider net. I figured if no one showed up, atleast I could cry about it in my own room.

A lot of people didn’t show up! Some RSVPed but a lot of people I thought would come didn’t bother to even say they weren’t. I was feeling really down about it at first and extremely embarrassed. I was so visibly anxious, a family member took me inside and made me take a shot of alcohol for my own good. Appreciated. 

But my very large family, my close friends and some friends I didn’t expect came through and we had a lot of fun. So I don’t regret it, but if it never happened, I think my only loss would be that I would just have a few less stories to tell (same thing with prom).

I didn’t have the vacation option nor would I have willingly travelled with both of my parents alone. But a nice vacation sounds like a very worthwhile memory. Seeing the world tops a sweet 16. But I know milestones and grandmothers are important. Would talking to your grandmother and telling her you may not do it be an option? Or maybe consider a really low key one with just a couple friends and family. No need for the whole big thing."

AskMen,fejm2t6,t1_fej35xc,1579179486.0,"Don’t get caught up in the gender blaming nonsense. It will never bring you answers and it will never lead you to happiness. When it comes to a lot of sexist or hypocritical actions, you can blame both genders. Yeah maybe a lot of women claim they want sensitivity when they don’t know what it actually entails. But how many men come on here venting about how they can’t open up to their guy friends? How they’ll get made fun of if they open up emotionally? I actually saw a post on here and men started saying a huge benefit of their female friendships was the emotional support. 

You can’t blame women for all the fathers out there telling their sons to toughen up and stop crying. Sometimes even hit them if they don’t comply. It goes deep into society and it’s been around for years. Both traditional genders have, in different ways, enforced it. 

So if you open up to a girl and that’s the sole reason she’s turned off (not her realizing she doesn’t like you enough to get to know all parts of you) then she’s doomed, not you. Because men are people and they feel more than just anger (thank god). Most humans understand this non problem."

He tells you he no longer loves or has feelings for you, he leaves instead of sticking around to work out problems, he won’t even consider quitting smoking when he has an infant daughter and now he said he would choose virtual women over you. 

No you’re not overreacting. Any one of these things is worth leaving him over. He has given you a whole basket full. When it comes to your relationship, I wouldn’t trust a word he has to say because it all sounds like garbage. He purposely puts you down and says hurtful things so you lose your confidence and stay with him. Because the only women who will put up with him at the moment is a woman who’s self confidence he has damaged and struggles to leave him due to finances and kids....and virtual women who don’t even know him.  That’s says a lot about him, not you.

You said you’re waiting until you’re emotionally and financially ready, and I understand that. But keep in mind, you may not be fully ready when it’s the right time to leave and for you and your child, you might have to do it anyway. Do you have family or friends to stay with?

You sound like you’re trying to be respectful. But you’re not in a platonic situation and I think you realized that.

You never stated you only view her as a friend and she hasn’t acted like she only views you as a friend. So...you’re not friends. All this hanging out isn’t friendship anymore. It is low key dating. Office gossip absolutely sucks, but they’re picking up on signals you guys are sending out. You’re very close with each other, a little more flirtatious than you might realize and your connection continues to grow.

The fact that her boyfriend only freaked out when he overheard the gossip sounds like she isn’t being completely forthcoming with him about you. Could you blame him for struggling to trust her and feel secure when she’s being sketchy about her workout buddy and coworker that she spends a ton of time with? That she went from wanting to spend her whole life with him to being sick of his shit in a relatively short span of time?

Maybe they were really spiraling before but she sees you as an escape hatch. And I see two possible outcomes (maybe there are more): she leaves him and regrets it OR she leaves him and immediately goes for you. It could all work out, but right now it has a higher chance of crashing and burning.

I would suggest you back off a little. You can be upfront and let her know. Mention you’re giving her some space to work things out honestly with her boyfriend or proceed with the breakup without distractions.

To me, meeting without any texting connection first is actually a waste of time. If me and the other person can’t have a proper text convo (or phone call for some people) when we have an entire ocean’s worth of questions we could possibly ask each other, I consider it doomed.

It may be small talk at first, but it can easily get into a legitimate conversation. You haven’t even met the person, you have nothing to lose. You could ask about her everyday life, you could ask her something philosophical, ask her about something silly from childhood. 

If you’re not a big texter, you can let her know and maybe you could both call or video chat. If you have limited hours, due to work or other obligations, let her know. That’s good communication and is indicative of how you’d be in the future. You guys won’t be with each other everyday if you were dating. You have lives, one of you might travel.

askwomenadvice,fdqgb64,t3_emqf5b,1578665942.0,"Maybe I’m a bit biased from my own experiences, but his actions seem purposeful.

It seems his answers were a little manipulative. “I’m just enjoying myself baby” like you were demanding he come home, when he was the one stating he was on his way home. If I’m going by what you wrote in this post, it doesn’t sound like you were trying to ruin his night, just seemed like you wanted straightforward answers. 

At first him not texting you that he was going out seemed like a reasonable mistake. But then he said he would call you during the concert and then he went dark on you for hours but was still active on his phone. He told you he was on his way to the hotel and then ignored you again. Then when you got annoyed, he calls you crazy. The reasonable response would be “sorry I completely forgot to let you know we decided to stay out a bit longer.” Or at least take ownership of the fact that his correspondance has been spotty and vague. He thought he had a minute to call you but plans changed. That’s okay, but his reaction was not. Instead he was doing some crazy making and honestly looked like he was trying to push your buttons to make you feel jealous or anxious.

Blowing up his phone wasn’t your best move but in this particular situation it wasn’t “crazy.” But a healthy response when someone is blowing up your phone is to ask what’s wrong or ignore it until they calm down. Posting it on social media is completely unhealthy. Now he’s making fun of you and getting other people on his side. No one who makes a complaint post and writes “yikes” is expecting everyone to side with the SO. They want the sympathy and the attention. It also shows he views problems in your relationship as a me versus you. I win, everyone else agrees with me, you lose. 

Boy that sounds like a fun way to argue.

It makes me cringe when someone makes posts legitimately complaining about their SO.


I think you should take the time to think about why you acted that way. Do you trust him? I wouldn’t blame you if you did or didn’t. But do you trust him with new people? During a night out on the town? While drinking? Late at night? Your reaction seems like deep down you may have doubts. 

Don’t let him call you crazy or make you feel that way. If the worst thing you do when he’s bothered you is call his phone a bunch, then I would say you need to work on how you express frustration and he needs to stop putting you down."

One thing that helped me significantly was to stop thinking of it as something I inherited and start to think of it as something I learned and adapted to. Inheritance implies very little control and then no effort to change your behavior. But you have self awareness and you are capable of changing, despite how deep seated it feels.

Anger was always a form of self protection and a blanket emotion for when I couldn’t express how I was really feeling. It was the only way I could ever stand up for myself. So I needed to stop using it as a crutch and think of the damage it could cause. 

Driving? I thought about how a moment of unnecessary anger could kill someone. I would sit there and think about how that would pan out in detail until I drilled it in my head that it wasn’t worth it. No ones out there trying to spite me. They’re just driving poorly.

Now not just about the issue you posted but about different views and approaches toward money due to different backgrounds. Your frustrations are valid, but I’m wondering if your resentment is making you feel extra closed off about the whole thing.

First, she can’t help growing up with money any more than you could help growing up without it. As someone who was on the other side of that in a relationship, boy did I get sick of the unnecessary guilt I had for growing up with more and my view of them lessened with every reminder. What you both can help is how you treat money now. There’s a difference.

As for this issue, calling them dumb ideas, even just on reddit, is invalidating and kind of belittling. You should use the products you want and she should never force you like she did, but she has reasons that are just as important to her. Especially if she has your health in mind, that’s never dumb and you shouldn’t make her feel bad for caring about you. 

It is really annoying when someone gives into buzzwords and health scares but there’s a kernel of truth in all that. A lot of these products are bad for us, so it is nice to make some healthy changes. So maybe where money permits, you both could find a middle ground? Buy the products you’re used to and a couple healthier ones on the side. That way you can use them at your leisure and if it’s awful, you can ask her if she wants it or will return it. You can even research a few things. It doesn’t have to be your hygiene routine, it could be food or cleaning products.

2). You gave her access and then took it away. That throws your whole argument out the window. You only trust her in certain circumstances while driving and traveling internationally? I think you gave her the illusion that you were building trust in her and then you took a major step back. She is rightfully confused and it makes sense why it upset her. 

It seems you’re just saying no because you don’t want to back down to what you believe is an unjust demand from her. If you want to stay with her, one of you will have to concede.

That’s why someone who socially drinks a little alcohol once a week may not have a drinking problem, but someone who becomes a wreck once a month does. That’s the difference between your drinking and his drinking.

Also, you are accountable for your behavior when you’re drunk. It’s coming from you. You don’t pick up a new personality with every bottle of liquor. So it’s never an excuse to blame your being drunk for all the hell you caused with it.

If you’re going to work through this, he needs to acknowledge he has a problem and treat it seriously.

Used to blame myself like OP. Then I realized I’m not responsible for a grown man (or woman’s) emotions, especially when they can’t handle them.

He will eventually play dumb or feel overwhelmed like “is she really asking me how I’m doing or is she questioning why I didn’t text her enough??”

Also, calling him out on it with the smacking lips comment may work for something that’s not a habit. But when it comes to bad habits, the person doing them isn’t aware just how often they’re doing it.

He may get a little defensive but hopefully he will realize it’s something he needs to work on. 

I think it’s better to hear it from you straight up rather than trying to decrypt your random comments."

If someone wrote to me: “He is good guy” instead of the correct way “He is a good guy,” it sounds so off, my inner voice even adds in a heavy accent. 

Or putting an unnecessary article, like “Is that show on the Broadway?” instead of the correct way “Is that show on Broadway?”

I think if someone wanted to sound more native, that would be a good thing to improve.

Another indicator is that sometimes the person makes a mistake that would work just fine in their language. For example, adjective placement. If you have any knowledge of that language, it becomes clear that they’re not native. It’s always interesting to me."

I doubt if we were talking about this situation in reverse you would find it just as funny to make nicknames for Korean people just trying to speak English. To which our response would be “oh you people from Northeast Asia are just so sensitive.” 

Nah.

I hear people pronounce English words in a funny way or just downright wrong all the time, but I’m not about to call them names or make fun of them. I respect the effort they’re putting into speaking another language."
