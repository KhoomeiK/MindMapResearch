Edit: Listened to the full AA song, and nah. Still not for me. Happy for the fans though."
ASOUE,fqdgoaq,t3_gi0h6w,1589289263.0,"I rewatched the movie last night, and it really is just a rushed-through adaptation of the first three books. Sure, there are creative liberties taken, such as the Happy Elf intro, and a few other differing plot points. For example, Count Olaf locking the orphans in a car on a railway track. It's a very exciting cinematic set piece, but I fail to see the logic behind it -- I believe Count Olaf mentions in the novels that at least one orphan needs to be alive in order for him to access the fortune (upon said orphan turning 18). Wouldn't killing the three of them be counterproductive to his schemes?

Solely by nature of being a film, it likely has a larger budget per minute of screen time. While both the film and the series look great, the film has darker, dingier production design that falls more in line with the tone of the books, in my opinion. It has more of a mid-2000s Hot Topic ""emo"" vibe, while the series sometimes feels bright and overly colorful, which I find is incompatible with the tone of the books. Thomas Newman's score for the film is also beautiful and perfect for the series, and he rightly received an Oscar nomination for it.

The acting style required for film is often different than what plays well for television, so there are some differences in the portrayal of certain characters. While Jim Carrey certainly still does his ""Jim Carrey thing"" as Count Olaf, I still think he's the better actor. Despite lots of hammy Carreyisms in the film, his Olaf still feels more like a living, breathing character to me. He feels a little more dangerous. NPH's Olaf, while good, still just seems like NPH in a series of costumes to me. Carrey's Olaf disguises are also more convincing, whereas I find NPH's to be more broad and unbelievable. Carrey's Stephano doesn't sound anything like Olaf, while NPH's voices are pretty transparent extensions of his regular voice, just pitched a little higher. While the adults in ASOUE are quite stupid by nature, I find it easier to believe that they would be more convinced by the film's disguises. I know many prefer NPH's take, and while I love it myself, I'll always be partial to Carrey.

In terms of the Baudelaires, I don't have much to say. Both sets of actors are incredible. I was always partial to the 2004 orphans, because I was 9 when the film was released, and, well, I had a crush on the actress who portrayed Violet. But rewatching both the series and the film has reminded me of how well both groups of kids did with these roles.

As far as the secondary characters go, I find it to be a mixed bag. I find Billy Connolly to be somewhat warmer and kinder as Monty, and Meryl Streep to be more convincingly cowardly as Josephine, but I appreciate the performances of the actors in the series too (though I found Alfre Woodard to be somewhat miscast as Aunt Josephine). That said, something that must be mentioned is that the movie is way too white, and I totally understand why Netflix cast people of colour in the roles of Mr. Poe, Uncle Monty and Aunt Josephine. Were they any non-white actors in the film at all? I'm glad that Netflix corrected this and gave us a more accurate reflection of our world.

Catherine O'Hara is also perfect as Justice Strauss. Kind, a little gullible, but slightly more grounded than some of the larger-than-life characters that inhabit this world. Joan Cusack was a little too wacky in the series for how I interpreted her in the novels.

K. Todd Freeman was a revelation as Mr. Poe in the Netflix series. When reading the books, I pictured Poe almost exactly as Timothy Spall's version: a stout, stuffy British man. But I can no longer picture anyone but KTF as Mr. Poe. He is so hilarious in the role that he actually makes me want MORE Poe in the story. In the books and film, I find him to be such an annoying, frustrating character, but the humour brought to him in the series is pitch perfect. 

Besides Mr. Poe, the only characters I can say that I definitely prefer in the TV adaptation are Olaf's henchpersons. Perhaps because they're given more screen time, allowing them to be more developed as full-fledged characters, but I find them to be a more eclectic gang of weirdos. They are more memorable, simply put.

I don't have much else to say, though I must mention the strange framing structure. The movie opens with the start of The Bad Beginning, moves on to The Reptile Room and The Wide Window, and then loops back around to use the end of The Bad Beginning as the film's climax. While I understand this from a screenwriter's perspective -- the end of TBB is a great final scene, what with Sunny dangling from the edge of a tower and Violet's imminent marriage to Count Olaf -- I find it a little disappointing that it doesn't deliver a direct adaptation of the novels, which as a fan of the books, you love to see. Though I will commend them for using a telescope to burn the marriage certificate; certainly a more cinematic ending than a legal loophole involving signing with your other hand!

I also want to mention that I like the small added detail of all of Aunt Josephine's fears coming true during the collapse of her home, such as the refrigerator nearly crushing them, the stove catching fire, and the doorknobs exploding. It vindicates Josephine's fears to some degree and shows that they aren't completely unfounded, which I found to be a nice twist. The Baudelaires being stranded on a piece of floor also adds some high stakes to the scene, which is exciting.

Clearly, the series is the definitive adaptation. Not only does it cover the entire series of books, but it also devotes more time to each one, allowing for more thorough recreations of the stories. But the film will also always hold a place in my heart, as the thing that introduced me to the dark, unfortunate world of ASOUE as a 9 year-old boy."

amiugly,fpk21dx,t1_fpjzip0,1588686395.0,"Man, I feel you...I consider myself a nice guy and a good person, but I definitely lack social skills. The less social interaction I have, the worse my social skills get. The worse my social skills get, the less chance I have at social interaction. It's a brutal cycle.

I guess I'm not one to give advice, but just keep putting yourself out there, at every chance you get. Maybe join some sort of club or volunteer group where you have to interact with others, hopefully (but not necessarily) around something you're passionate about. It's a great start, and will give you the building blocks to get to a place where social interaction isn't as much of a struggle. I joined our local chapter of Rotary a few years back, and it gave me a place where I was forced to put myself out of my comfort zone a few times a month -- I was still awkward, but it felt like more of a ""safe place"" to socialize with others than, say, a bar or even a classroom (just wrapped up university two years ago, it was a rough time for me too). Feeling like I was giving back to the community also made a positive impact on my self-esteem.

Whatever you decide to do, just don't give up or think you're a hopeless case. You're not ugly at all, so don't feel the need to post to these places (unless you need the positive reinforcement, in which case, I don't judge).

ASOUE,fph8f42,t3_gdbll3,1588616788.0,"I really enjoyed The Reptile Room! It really ups the stakes of the series with the murder of Uncle Monty. While the first book wasn't a happy-go-lucky romp by any means, I don't think any real murder occurred -- besides the death of the Baudelaire parents, but I don't think there was any mention of Olaf being the culprit until later on in the series. The closest the first book came to death was threats. Here, the Baudelaires truly learn that Olaf will go to terrible lengths to get his hands on their fortune, including murdering those that the orphans have grown to love.

This is also the first appearance of one of Olaf's disguised identities, which becomes a staple of the series. While Netflix's Stephano is perhaps more accurate to his literary description (mostly the beard), I may actually prefer Jim Carrey's take. I still frequently think about the line, ""Hello, my name is Stephano...I am an Italian man."" and smile. I love NPH as much as the next, but Carrey was a phenomenal Olaf.  

What continues to strike me about the Netflix adaptations is how faithful they are to the books, while still adding new dimensions to the story for those already familiar with the stories. I read the books a decade before the Netflix series was released, so I didn't notice on first watch, but reading/watching back-to-back has really hammered this home for me.

The movie of course had far less time to work with per novel, but I remember it being a somewhat looser adaptation. I'd love to revisit the film after we read The Wide Window, to compare the two adaptations.

The last two pages, when the Baudelaires and the Incredibly Deadly Viper shed mutual tears as they shared a distant goodbye, made me tear up too. I loved that the orphans got a moment to reminisce not only on how brilliant their departed uncle was, but how brilliant they themselves were in the face of danger. They deserved a self-congratulatory moment after such tragedy.

Between Olaf's first alter ego ""Stephano"" and the murder of the Baudelaire's guardian, The Reptile Room really is a whole new ballgame -- an expression which here means ""shit is about to get crazy""."

Rockband,fo3anwk,t1_fo366k1,1587483623.0,"Yeah, that's a great collection of Strokes tracks! Throw in ""Heart in a Cage"", maybe ""Hard to Explain"", and a couple of *Comedown Machine* tracks, and I think the pre-*TNA* essentials are covered."
Rockband,fo34i4o,t1_fo324au,1587480395.0,"Agreed! But also give their last album, 2013's Comedown Machine, another shot. I feel it got unwarranted hate, and there are quite a few tracks on that album that would be killer in Rock Band."

Rockband,fo31w2n,t3_g5fyaf,1587478958.0,"This is an incredible week!! Wow, between the Hayley Williams/Dua Lipa week, the Ra Ra Riot track last week, and now this, I'm absolutely loving this Spotlight Pass Plus. 

The new Strokes album is fantastic, and while ""Bad Decisions"" wouldn't have been my first choice (as we already have ""Dancing With Myself""), I'm just so glad to get anything from it. Can't believe this is the first new Strokes song we get in 8 years, there's so much more we need from them.

Harmonix has been doing great with pop picks this season. As opposed to playing barely-there synth lines with 20-measure breaks in every verse, we're getting tracks with actual guitar and bass, and with fairly active parts at that! ""Juice"" looks as though it'll be a ton of fun to play, and a perfect party track."
Rockband,fo0ez0x,t1_fo0e4kb,1587411908.0,"I was lukewarm on ""Caution"" at first too, but those synth strings got to me! Hopefully it grows on you. But yeah, really hoping we still get ""The Man"" down the line, I think it would be a super fun RB track."

* Rock/Grunge/Emo
* Classic Rock/Glam/Prog
* Alternative/Indie Rock/Reggae/Ska

Honestly, these three weeks have the potential to release my favourite DLC of the season. Hoping for some good stuff!"
Rockband,fo03q41,t1_fnzx7td,1587405546.0,"That would an amazing week! I've listened to *The New Abnormal* four times in the past week, and I've had ""Caution"" stuck in my head since release."

Earwolf,fnueqyb,t1_fnnv0gv,1587260420.0,"To each their own! I thought ""Dance of the Clairvoyants"" was their best single in a decade.

""Superblood Wolfmoon"" on the other hand, I could take or leave..."
Earwolf,fns4sb1,t1_fnrx7e3,1587212639.0,"Oh yeah, that's right!

By the way, this is a re-listen thread for episode 6 about Document, not the discussion thread for yesterday's Slowin' It Down ep."
Earwolf,fnqo8a6,t1_fnqfqu8,1587168609.0,"Man, consider me down! That would be awesome; have they mentioned being Pearl Jam fans?

I guess on today's new ep, Scott and Scott briefly played ""Dance of the Clairvoyants"" and ""Superblood Wolfmoon"", but where does Zouks come in?"
Earwolf,fnp77cm,t3_g34fcs,1587140422.0,"Not only do the Scotts lay down the first vocal tracks for ""How Does It Feel When You're In R.E.M.? (It Feels Good!)"", but Scott passes away multiple times. A very important episode."

Wonder if it'll have to be resubmitted, and whether this'll cause any delays on being able to play this song for the challenge."

halfmoonrun,fnhaluz,t3_g1ac4n,1586958652.0,Honestly...I think this song is better than some of the tracks on Blemish. Hope this gets an official release one day.
