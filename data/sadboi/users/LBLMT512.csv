My mom exhibits many/most symptoms of 3 of the 4 cluster B personality disorder types (borderline, histrionic, narcissistic) and I spent a lot of time trying to figure her out. My mom‚Äôs sister‚Äôs behavior leans more into the cluster C types you mentioned. Both of them - I learned just last year- were abused for years as children and when they tried to tell their parents what was happening, they were not believed or protected, and were instead made to feel ashamed, guilty and unworthy. 

Learning this really turned everything I thought I knew about my mom on its head. Her histrionics, her rages, her inability to function at times, her history of dissociation, etc. all look like cluster B personality disorder symptoms but I‚Äôve had to admit these symptoms taken in context might be better described as 60-years of untreated CPTSD in a little girl whose parents didn‚Äôt protect her from a monster. She‚Äôs lived her entire life in denial- fawning to her parents and even her abuser, dissociating so she doesn‚Äôt remember the abuse, self-medicating with food, but also raging, breaking down and unable to care for her own children or complete her reports at work. It makes so much more sense to me now why my dad never left her.

The realization really drove home what Pete Walker said in his CPTSD book about how (and please pardon my attempt at paraphrase here) if all the conditions that are the reactive results of childhood abuse and emotional neglect were condensed as a group of maladaptive coping strategies under a common heading in the DSM-V, the diagnostic manual could be reduced to the size of a small pamphlet.

This vid demonstrates the difference between doing them wrong (with humerus internally rotated, which is going to impinge the joint and give less range of motion and also not work the targeted muscles mentioned!) and correctly with shoulders in outward rotation. https://youtu.be/KC8mlDOYJ2I

And if you believe ‚Äúpizzagate‚Äù was real, you might be beyond help. It was demonstrably fabricated. I suggest you research the associated court cases. 

It seems to have occurred to you that there are some very powerful people in the world with some very sick, bad habits that leave them open to manipulation. You‚Äôre correct about that much. Jeffrey Epstein made a career out of leveraging people‚Äôs dirty secrets and bad habits. Bill Clinton was totally guilty of partying with that scumbag, as was Trump, Alan Dershowitz, and a shit ton of other famous, wealthy and powerful people. That much of the story is true. 

Do we know that each of Epstein‚Äôs associates raped little girls? Nope. Is it possible. Sure. Probable? Unlikely- he pulled in as many people as he could get dirt on to blackmail them but there were probably many he approached who didn‚Äôt compromise themselves.

But the pizzagate nonsense was a planted story designed to 1. make gullible people hate the Clintons even more, and 2. get reasonable people to find the entire ‚Äúinternational pedo ring‚Äù story so entirely absurd that they‚Äôd dismiss the entire thing (which is by design since it causes many to turn a blind eye to the real Epstein / Gislaine Maxwell / Mossad pedo ring story. 

Another classic tactic of such a manipulation, of course, is to accuse your enemies of the crimes you yourself are guilty of committing.  It sounds true because there‚Äôs a grain of truth. Someone DID do the thing they‚Äôre talking about- sex trafficking kids- the story is also exaggerated for plausible deniability that the teller (Jones) is guilty of inciting some wingnut to violence when they go shoot up a pizza place based on a hoax. 

Don‚Äôt be so gullible. The larger strategy behind these tactics is what‚Äôs called Active Measures- it‚Äôs always an engaging conspiracy theory (fun to think about and makes you feel smart, like you figured out some secret... this is by design), full of propaganda, division, disinformation, and foul play / organized crime. If you want to know the truth behind these layers of obfuscations, just ask yourself who gets paid / gets out of jail free / pardoned and who gets hurt."

Regardless, you don‚Äôt seem to understand 1. what flattening the curve means, 2. what the actual risks were and are, and 3. who is qualified to comment authoritatively on the matter. 

The curve is a graphed model of the (initially projected and then actual) deaths from covid. The reason we are sheltering in place is slow the spread *so people don‚Äôt overwhelm hospitals all at once*. 

This confuses a lot of people. It‚Äôs not to stop the spread- that‚Äôs inevitable without adequate testing and contact tracing- but if we didn‚Äôt shelter in place AND IF WE STOP SHELTERING TOO EARLY, infection rates will spike again, meaning our hospitals are operating at, projected,  2x-13x their capacity in the US (according to Imperial College London, March 16 https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf). 

Under those conditions, 2.5 million Americans would die. As of right now, if we maintain the shelter in place order until such a time as epidemiologists say the danger of another peak in the curve has passed, that saves the most lives. 

Yes, all those other problems you mentioned are big problems. But the risk to public health posed by a deadly disease with no immunity that kills as many as it does is not an acceptable risk. And you shouldn‚Äôt just take my word for it, you should seek out subject matter experts, who all say the same thing about this. 

There‚Äôs no good solution. All solutions are horrific and involve at least tens of thousands to millions of innocent Americans dying. Opening too early is a great risk to the functioning of our hospitals and medical systems that we all need to survive. Protecting that critical infrastructure not only puts citizens at risk medically due to covid, it puts us at enormously increased risk for dying of preventable causes from traffic accidents to minor heart attacks, and because it compromises our medical INFRASTRUCTURE, it puts us at increased risk for military invasion, terror attacks.

I will agree it‚Äôs time for the public to pick up the pieces and ‚Äúgo back‚Äù when the epidemiologists who‚Äôve been tracking the spread of the pandemic say our numbers are down low enough. I won‚Äôt be among the ones who can ‚Äúgo back‚Äù until after we have a vaccine, but I‚Äôll support the move to reopen when experts in the spread of infectious disease tell us it‚Äôs safe.

Congratulations on having this far avoided Alex Jones. He is a narcissist and a political hack with a relatively rabid (if small) fan base. He gets press mainly due  to being an extremist and being friends with some famous people- mostly far right politicians.

Posture,fp75emf,t1_fp6p0ns,1588364371.0,"You‚Äôre quite welcome! 

I mean, in the sense that it is part of the muscle group that stabilizes the shoulder, yes, but it‚Äôs not a prime mover in that movement. (More on the muscles used in pull-ups here: https://www.rubberbanditz.com/blog/muscles-worked-in-pull-ups-and-chin-ups/)

Here‚Äôs the quick and dirty on what you need to know to help shoulders that are rolling forward / inward toward the front midline of the body: 

The primary muscle that causes this ‚Äúmedial rotation‚Äù of the humerus (upper arm bone) is the subscapularis. It‚Äôs a hidden muscle that‚Äôs sandwiched on the back in between the McRibcage and the Scapula (aka the shoulder blade bone). This muscles works synergistically with lats (and others) to perform other shoulder stabilizing movements. 

You can poke at your own subscaps by lifting your arm (like you‚Äôre going to do an armpit fart or put on deoderant) and taking a big pinch of your underarm meat with the opposite hand. Your fingers will wrap around the back and sit on your lats and your thumb will naturally find that subscapularis. You can gently lean into the muscle with the thumb and should find some knots. Don‚Äôt go crazy on these bc you can really hurt yourself. Very tender area!

That said, if what we‚Äôre mainly wanting to address is medial rotation of the humerus, then it‚Äôs more helpful to take a look at the muscles that work in opposition to that movement: the muscles primarily responsible for lateral rotation of the humerus. These are the infraspinatus and teres minor.  
(Still with me?) 

What do we learn from these? Well, for starters they‚Äôre pretty small muscles, relatively speaking, so addressing the major muscle groups in the area is going to be important as well. We definitely want to address any muscular dysfunction that‚Äôs there. We can‚Äôt *only* work with these smaller muscles and achieve our best results. Gotta address the whole chain. 

So we want to strengthen the abdominals, the glutes, the muscles in the back of the neck, and the posterior deltoids (and to a lesser extent, the teres minor and infraspinatus). 

We also definitely need to gently stretch pectoralis minor, pec major, anterior deltoids, and stretch or at least try to get a release in the subscapularis using your thumbs or another similar tool (gently!!!). 

Opening the chest is hard for most people in western cultures because everything we habitually do (driving, typing on a computer or mobile phone, sitting in chairs) tends to medially rotate the heads of the humerus to the midline aka rounding shoulders forward. (Note this is not the same as rounding the back, although many people do both!)

Your body will try to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù on the chest and anterior deltoid stretch without you even knowing, typically by allowing the ribs to flare out in front, or the low back to arch and pelvis to tip (posterior pelvic tilt). Stretching these areas properly takes patience, deep breathing, and a willingness to work on your core and glutes FIRST.

So, to recap: 

Strengthen:

Gluteus, rectus abdominus and transverse abdominus, as well as the muscles that rotate your palms upward and outward when you turn the whole arm open from the top of the shoulder. 

Lastly, you wanna strengthen the muscles of the back of your neck - you do this by pressing the *back of your skull* (and NEVER your NECK!) into the floor or wall with your chin slightly tucked. You don‚Äôt wanna press the neck bones flat into a surface. 

You‚Äôre supposed to have a curve in your neck, ‚Äúcervical lordosis,‚Äù but our western habits tend to overstretch and weaken these muscles and can cause pain and other neck problems. Pressing neck into a surface would make it worse, but pressing the back of the skull strengthens the muscles and restores the cervical curve. 

And Stretch:

The hip flexors, the fronts of the shoulders (anterior deltoid), the chest and possibly the biceps. Hang out in your shoulder stretches and breathe! I posted another message a while back w a bunch of links to the exercises already, but this explains why to do those exercises in particular!

TLDR: If your back is strong and you‚Äôre upright, not experiencing kyphosis but still have the inward rotation of the arms / shoulders it tells you your subscapularis is being engaged more than its antagonist muscles- the teres minor and infraspinatus. It also means we need to open the front of the shoulders and the chest."

Now I cut them off before they can get out the words with the foolish assumptions that whatever I saw or went through couldn‚Äôt have been that bad.

Posture,fokav2y,t1_fo62j6p,1587838630.0,"I would continue to try to stretch anterior deltoid and pec minor and would add release for the subscapularis. 

The fact that your thumbs face forward when you stand is better than if your pinky was forward, but you want to keep the external rotation going even more to correct this- you want thumbs pointing out to the sides and palm forward (in yoga this posture is called samasthitihi). 

The subscapularis is the primary muscle that internally rotates the humerus (the top of the arm bone that attaches to the outer clavicle, or ‚Äúfront of shoulders‚Äù) and so stretching that muscle will relax that overly tight muscle, will allow increased external rotation of the upper arm bone and will improve your posture.

It will be important to keep the rib cage from popping out in the front and the low back from arching when you do the chest openers- if your rib cage is jutting out when you do your chest openers then you‚Äôre not getting the benefit of those stretches. (If this is difficult, you will also need to add core work- most people could use extra core work daily anyway!)

yoga,fo5tpq7,t1_fo3wrnm,1587535383.0,"Bingo! As a former ballerina and longtime yogi who never lifted in her life until a few years ago, I have essentially the opposite story as you guys but here‚Äôs why it matters: you have to have a balance of strength and flexibility (in Sanskrit: stirrha and sukkha.) 

If your body is all super tight muscles from lifting, you won‚Äôt have the ease of breath and movement you might otherwise and will have a whole set of issues and injuries from overly tight muscles. The other side of the coin is being ultra flexible without enough strength to protect the joints and connective tissue from overstretching, which causes a whole other set of injuries! (I know- I‚Äôve had them all!) 

I started lifting and doing HIIT to protect my joints and it was the best decision ever. I haven‚Äôt injured myself from overstretching since I started weight training! For you guys, yoga will be the best decision ever and with continued practice, your breathing capacity, core strength, fine muscle coordination and freedom of movement will all improve. 

The key teaching of the Buddha is to find the middle way- a balance between stirrha and sukkha. Yoga allows us to practice finding that important balance in each pose, in our breathing, and in life."

Instead, keeping the knees bent, your neck and back long and your shoulders back, take the heart towards the tops of the thighs.

You‚Äôre right where you need to be, so focus on your breath, lengthening the spine and extending through the crown of your head while keeping the back flat.

massage,fo5o3bb,t1_fo56nr7,1587530631.0,"I strongly second this excellent piece of advice! Here‚Äôs Cristina Lerner-Schroth‚Äôs textbook: Three-Dimensional Treatment for Scoliosis: A Physiotherapeutic Method for Deformities of the Spine. 

Best thing the book taught me: frequently the PAIN is in the *overstretched* muscle (counterintuitive until you really think about it). 

In scoliosis, the muscles in the concave side of a curve will be overly tight, and in the convex side of a curve they will be overstretched. This leads to pain, spasms and cramping in the overstretched muscles as the body attempts to balance the curve. 

As LMT‚Äôs we carefully work into both sides of a curve during a massage, but we are careful to use much gentler pressure and strokes on the overstretched (painful) side. We don‚Äôt want to dig in to the area where the muscles are overstretched, as it may injure the client. If the client can tolerate it, we can work more deeply into the concave side of the curve where the muscles are locked down. We‚Äôre going for balance and relief. 

It will be valuable for you to keep that in mind as you stretch!

In yoga we talk about the 10 different movements of the spine:

1. Flexion (forward bending)
2. Extension (back bending)
3. Lateral flexion (side bending- to left and right)
4. Twisting (to left and right)
5. Combination of lateral flexion (side bending - to left and right) with twisting (to left and right)

You can achieve all these movements with the following yoga exercises:

1. Cat pose or child‚Äôs pose
2. Cow pose or locust pose
3. Gate pose or seated side bends (to left and right)
4. Seated spinal twists (to left and right)
5. Triangle pose -and- revolved triangle pose (to left and right) or ardha matsyendrasana (to left and right) -and- seated twist bringing front shoulder towards same knee (to left and right)

Since some of the cramping is occurring in your intercostals, breath work along with stretching will help reset the ribs and help you feel better. 

Try a full, complete exhale and hold breath out to a count of 3 (to give the reactive spasm a little time to rest), 
then allow the inhale to happen naturally, slowing at the top of the inhale but not holding the breath in, allowing it to flow back out and then again really squeezing every little bit of air out of the lungs, allowing the rib cage to contract before holding the breath out and allowing the inhale to occur involuntarily. 

During the exercise, aim for your exhale to be about twice as long as the inhale. This breathing supports the nervous system in shifting out of sympathetic nervous system activation (fight or flight from stress and pain) and into a calm, restful state that supports healing and improves pain.

Feel free to hit me up in the DM! I have nothing but time and can help you find more yoga resources if you like.

massage,fnzxcqx,t1_fny2l9j,1587402379.0,"This is shocking! I‚Äôm so proud of you for standing up for yourself and drawing a firm professional boundary about your practice with this outrageously inappropriate and abusive client.

Please share your experience with your employer in writing and include your personal and professionals boundaries so everyone is clear and nothing like this happens again. 

For me, these would include:

1. I refuse to jeopardize my reputation, my membership in my insurance-providing professional assn. or my license by practicing while my insurance coverage is suspended and the state has banned massage. 

2. This decision is firm and is not up for discussion. Perhaps also give the office a copy of this statement in writing that they can share with clients.

3. I would definitely draw a firm boundary that your personal contact details are to always remain private. 

It sounds like this person didn‚Äôt respect the boundaries of the front desk staff either and berated them to the point where they‚Äôd put an abusive client in touch with you - knowing they‚Äôd pressure you to do something unethical and dangerous that could jeopardize your professional license. This is unfortunate and shouldn‚Äôt have been allowed to happen. I‚Äôd reiterate that clients do not receive my personal details and if they need to deliver a message they can do so via clinic staff. 

If it were me, I would block this particular client from contacting me further on every channel (phone, email, social media, etc.). Their behavior raises so many red flags for me, as a survivor or domestic abuse. Like someone else wisely pointed out above, a client who doesn‚Äôt respect your ‚Äúno‚Äù is not a client you want. 

This person has sufficiently demonstrated their lack of respect for you and normal professional boundaries (calling you at home / raising their voice / refusing to take no for an answer) that there‚Äôs no reason you should ever have to work with them again. 

Let your chiropractor know you won‚Äôt be seeing this client anymore for any reason. There is probably a written code of conduct in your office  that includes right to refuse service (and usually also details proper handling of employees‚Äô personal details). If so, this will back up your decision. Did they give you an employee manual when you were hired? 

Document everything (even if you don‚Äôt think they will continue to harass you). Do this to practice establishing good boundaries and as a legal / personal safety precaution in case the situation escalates. 

Please also report them to your local massage licensing board, just as you would with any client who harassed you or violated your boundaries. The reason for this is so that there is a complaint on file in case this abuser decides to retaliate and, say, falsely report you for violating the stay at home order / working during quarantine. Abusive people are dangerous and predictable in their escalation. Please protect yourself. 

Lastly, I‚Äôd like to assure you that you‚Äôve done nothing wrong, you didn‚Äôt deserve this treatment, and that ALL of your feelings are valid. Your rage at their abusive treatment, your embarrassment that someone might hear, your fear, your desire to appease them by offering an alternative, your grief that you can‚Äôt practice right now, your anxiety that this abuse might happen again, and (I imagine though you didn‚Äôt mention your feelings on the matter) your hurt / betrayal by the office staff, all of it.

Sometimes stressful situations arise that trigger old stuff- stuff from childhood or our history- and at these times it‚Äôs best to notice the feelings that arise and what our tendencies are for dealing with it. The psychologist and author Pete Walker calls these instances ‚Äúemotional flashbacks‚Äù and talks about how to recognize when we‚Äôre in one, how to take care of ourselves and heal our past traumas (even interpersonal mini-traumas such as having had a scary or unreliable caretaker for part of our childhood). 

He says that seeing the self fully, acknowledging all the feelings and the past situations that are coming up in this moment and grieving for the hurt child within (which may involve having an appropriately-channeled angry outburst like hitting a pillow with a tennis racket or crying healing tears) are essential for our own healing. 

Panic attacks can be a sign that this very frustrating situation, where you were mistreated by someone who in a position of power / dominance, contains clues about or emotional-dynamic similarities to some unresolved traumatic situation or situations in your past. 

I hope you are being gentle with yourself and allowing yourself the time and space to explore what else this brought up for you. You have permission to care for yourself, to feel what you feel, to draw boundaries, be human, to make mistakes, to grieve, to heal, and to be empowered! I hope you have a trusted therapist or other nonjudgmental confidant you can talk to about all this. Be well! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

CPTSD,fnts65h,t1_fntiuyz,1587247653.0,"This is a good question and I would also be interested in knowing the answer. 

The technique she describes- sort of an incremental expansion of our internal circle of trust- is similar to what some Buddhists talk about doing when one is striving for a shift in perspective. 

The way I have heard it described is that first you notice the predominant emotion inhabiting the body- try to determine where in your body you locate the feeling, the texture of it, the weight, density, color, and any other description of it. 

Now close your eyes and imagine a clear blue sky. The sky represents the blank canvas of your mind. Imagine the emotion as something passing through the sky- gathering storm clouds, a soaring plane, a flock of birds, an annoying gnat. 

Notice the form of the emotion or sensations associated with it, but even if you feel overwhelmed by the emotion (aka a storm rolling through, with lightning and thunder, covering the sky from your view) try to notice the blue peeking through. 

Notice what else is present- what other thoughts, emotions and sensations are there at the same time? If you are depressed and in pain, can you find one part of your body that works well and does not hurt? Maybe your eyes, ears or hands? Can you expand the blue of the calm sky and envision the dark clouds dissipating? 

Can you expand your awareness enough to hold the difficult sensations and emotions simultaneously with the pleasant ones? 

What happens to your body and mind as you focus your awareness on the one peasant feeling? What happens to your picture of the sky?

You could do a similar exercise with expanding your circle of trust, noticing how the small amount of trust you give someone changes the feelings and sensations in your body. 

OP used the examples of knowing that her bf will not leave her today and that her classmates will give her a turn to talk. How do those small trusts feel? What do they look like? Size, shape, color, texture? Where do you feel it in the body when you think about it?

If your mistrust is caused by trauma you might notice that the trust feels good but is also scary. Maybe you feel like you want to run, hide or fight. Can you hold space for all those things at the same time? You have a choice about how you respond to what you feel. Could taking slow, calm steady breaths help you to tolerate the feelings?

Maybe you don‚Äôt trust a specific person because they‚Äôve proven to be unreliable or selfish. Good for you to not trust them! That is self-protective. But maybe someone else has proven to be a good listener and a kind person, deserving of a little trust. Can you extend a little trust in their direction, even if it‚Äôs conditional (‚Äúfor today,‚Äù or even ‚Äúfor the next half hour‚Äù)? 

These exercises are part of the practice of what‚Äôs called mindfulness. Mindfulness has good clinical results for those working with past trauma. There are quite a number of mindfulness meditations available in books and videos. I hope this helps someone!
