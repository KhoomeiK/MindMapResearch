You need to be on Accutane yesterday. I would highly recommend going back and insisting you begin immediately."
acne,f4iox5p,t1_f4hvoe4,1571607465.0,"The thing about using BP as a spot treatment is it's not helping to prevent new acne from forming, and that's what you really need right now. Since you're already using BP and presumably your skin can tolerate it you should stick with that for now, but try an alternative approach to your treatment.

What I would recommend is to cut out the rose water and use a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide morning and evening. Apply a very, very thin layer of BP to your entire face before you apply your moisturizer. You should see improvement almost immediately. After a little while you could gradually bring the other things into your routine like the rose water, face masks, etc. 

The other option I would recommend is to go to a doctor. They could get you on Retin-A or something similar."
acne,f4hknke,t1_f4fum7x,1571592670.0,"What does your routine consist of? Your skin isn't bad at all, and should be easy to clean up - what's going to be important is consistency in your routine.

If I were you, I would wash my face gently (I use Cetaphil gentle foaming face cleanser) one time at night and apply a very thin layer of the BP over your entire face or problem ""areas"" and leave it on overnight. Keep in mind that if you use BP as a spot treatment, it won't prevent new acne from forming, so it's important to use it in areas you commonly have issues. Use just a very small amount. Make sure you follow it up with a good moisturizer formulated for your face. CeraVe is a good option and it's what I use. 

When you wake up in the morning to shower wash your face with lukewarm / colder water only, and moisturize your entire face before you go out.

Lose the tea tree oil, lose the aloe vera - your acne is very mild, so keeping your routine simple will be a much better approach. Once you have this down, you can start to experiment with things like clay masks or chemical exfoliants like AHA if you desire, because they have a lot more benefits than just acne prevention and treatment.

Once again the most important thing is consistency in your routine. Not moisturizing for a day or two will upset the delicate balance of sebum production that your skin has worked hard to maintain. You *need* to moisturize, every day. Morning and night. It is non optional."

That's what I saw too. She was basically acting jealous because her boyfriend went to see his father. What the fuck."
