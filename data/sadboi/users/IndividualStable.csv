For me I have like 5 songs that I love that somehow I can listen to to drown out the noise of my son, dog, and husband when silence isn't an option.  I also found that sitting in the shower with my head under the stream can sometimes help.  But completely, sensory overload."
JUSTNOMIL,fot3jwa,t1_forlc83,1588043852.0,"I second this!  My son is closest not to my Monsterinlaw, not to my mom, not even to the awesome StepMIL... We have a ""foster mimi"" that is amazing.  He loves her like a grandparent*.  The people that are meant to be in our lives will fit, don't waste time forcing pieces to an outdated version of the puzzle.  I also second video camera doorbells.  Best wishes!"
JUSTNOMIL,fmgjqss,t3_fuzvu3,1586050586.0,"The good thing about living on an army base is she isn't visiting.  That is one of my favorite things about the decision my husband made about going full CO now many years after I pulled the plug - there is no ""popping in"" or demands.  FWIW You aren't the B.  Block her number, mute her for x number of days on FB and enjoy the new bundle and adjust to the new household chaos."
JUSTNOMIL,fmghfge,t1_fmfbo4t,1586049135.0,"Dead on NearlyPointless.  I'm sorry OP.  It sucks.  It sounds like BF has a history of getting his way with MIL and he is employing the same tantrum tactics with you to get you to buy him the ""candy bar in the grocery store"" aka walk the dog, get your own stuff etc.  My MIL still viewed my husband as a child when we got married and assumed that I was also going to take a child role. I had very successfully lived on my own and wasn't going backwards.  Relationships are partnerships.  The caliber of guy that I attracted and even turned down after spending 6 months entirely living on my own would have been my ""dream guy"" prior.  I'm sorry,  MIL issues coupled with SO warning signs definitely warrant the hard therapy talks you were describing.  If SO has never had to do laundry then MIL could have though she was just doing her ""job.""  I'm sorry, it sucks.  Best of luck."
JUSTNOMIL,fmgdh7j,t3_fuw9m7,1586046581.0,"I would definitely be careful which it sounds like you are.  My MIL and SFIL tried to make me seem unfit when they were at their worst because they thought husband and I were goign to get divorced and wanted to sue for visitation.  People like this are ugly examples of humanity.  Keep records.  I would also say that while she is trying to make you seem ""too stressed"" her comment that it is the flu and subsequent documentation will help your cause.  If that craziness is her belief then it stands to logic that even a ""normal"" person would be ""too stressed"" by having ANY precaution about the pandemic.  That message from her is gold.  Sorry you are going through all this and I wish you the best.

ETA.  I don't understand the vase reference... if it was in your home how is SHE working it out with insurance?"
AmItheAsshole,fmg4uua,t1_fmf71sm,1586041301.0,"Thanks for the post!  I agree - it was BAD which is why I was done.  Totally not acceptable, and some of the worst I have seen him drink since his early 20's.  Just wanted to clarify that it wasn't 40 EVERY week. It's bad, but I wanted to make sure that I wasn't exaggerating the scope because it wouldn't help me get objective opinions.  It's been over a week which is a start.  I think he knows I'm done with it.  The way our conversation came up hasn't been like any other time and I had a clarity that I think scared him.  It wasn't ""I want you to stop drinking"" it was ""I'm going to leave and go to family with the kids because I'm not going to keep getting on this ride anymore."" The quarrentines made just getting up and going a little more complicated so I am still here.  Even a week in when he was trying to rationalize one drunk night a week moving forward because ""he is just minding his business and it shouldn't be an issue"" I didn't budge. I just don't think a shitfaced night every week is a ok with a kid around regardless of prior history.  I don't think children who are at the ages where they are starting to make sense of the world should see their parents drunk.

ETA, because of our crazy different backgrounds I was just not sure if I was an asshole for saying that once a week getting drunk with kids is a dick move and I'm not cool with it in general.  I didn't grow up with that so I didn't know if I was just naive."

AmItheAsshole,fmdon0y,t1_fmdlvsj,1585973341.0,"Thanks for the advice.  The Al-Anon is something I have looked into in the past.  I just needed persepective on how ""normal"" drinking once a week to the point of stumbling is.  In my family people didn't get drunk.  In his it was multiple times a week and kids as young as 12 are being given alcohol by underage older siblings as parents looked the other way.  I was fine when I felt like he could control it which has been about 70% of our relationship but this new uptick scared me because there wasn't a reset.  Normally he will drink, increase, increase more, I say something, he stops for a bit.  This last time we stopped drinking for over a month and a half and instead of starting back at like a six pack a week he was immediatly back to 2 six packs first week and by the 3rd week he was back to 3-4 most days and drinking to complete drunkness on weekends.  I flipped this time after there was a super drunk friday with 6 - 9% ACV beers followed by a monday night with 5 9% pints of beer.  He went to work reeking of alcohol on probably 4.5 hours of sleep and I was over it (*After making sure to stay awake till 3 am to ensure the stove was off*).  Now he (*claims he*) wants to get drunk but says he will just do it on Friday night and doesn't understand why I'm not ok with this all considering he isn't a crazy abusive person to me (like one family member), being an antagonistic ass on FB or calling people (like another), or getting DUI's like another 2 family members.  When we got married I saw some warning signs but they were all centered around one family member.  Hubs was clear he had it under control, it was situational, and we were young... Since we have been married more has come to light with the family and issues with alcohol and his drinking still has periods where you would think he was pledging for a frat... in his mid 30's. I know I can't change him and he needs to fall on his face.  That was what I started the convo with last week before saying I was going to go out of state to family with our kiddos so he could have some time to think.  Today we were talking and that is when he said it frustrated him that he can't just have a drunk day a week basically."
AmItheAsshole,fmdkrrd,t1_fmdf5yu,1585970372.0,"Yeah the harping is why I asked to be sure.  If I am I'll reassess.  My writing is crap tonight because my brain is all over the place with this.  I tried to clarify above that not all weeks were 40 but he also isn't a ""bud"" drinker.  All of his beers are above 8.5% alcohol.  In ""bud"" beers he was easily doing the equivalent of 24- 40 beers a week solo, as the only drinker in the house before I said enough this last time.  There was one week where a buddy was over and during that week they went through 70 beers between them despite it being a work week and the friend was not the heavy drinker."
AmItheAsshole,fmdjdy8,t1_fmde7nj,1585969338.0,ETA - I do not want to exaggerate to say it was 40 every week.  Just clarifying what I had initially said with the 4/10 in my very badly worded post. I have no doubt that there were at least 3 weeks since Jan that hit this high but there were certainly weeks where it was less. It's an ebb and flow.  Up until me freaking out the overall intake was increasing every 2 weeks by about a 6 pack (but again his beer has 2x the alcohol of a bud).  Some nights it was 2 but usually 3-4 on weeknights and he would come home with at least a case on fridays to demolish and be itching to get more on sat typically as well. If we were around people he could easily polish 24 beers (9.5% alcohol - edit I looked it up this beer they were drinking is 9% ABV) from friday to Sunday.  Our recycling bin was always overflowing basically.
AmItheAsshole,fmdi9ps,t1_fmdgz2x,1585968519.0,"Man, I'm stinking at being clear today.  Ugh. Sorry. Irritated.  I don't want any drunk nights or (*Have him drink*) every day.  I was fine when he drank one or 2 max a night and maybe 3 on a weekend night (*but*) didn't go through more than 2 six packs a week.  He didn't hear a peep then even with our history.  He also isn't drinking bud light... he goes for the fancy (and expensive) high alcohol suckers.  I  He is definitely an alcoholic because his brain CRAVES it.  He is also in a very high visability career and was getting to the point that you could smell beer on him in the am when I put my foot down this last time again.  I just didn't know if ""normal"" people would think that getting drunk one night a week was ok.  In the world I grew up with that was NOT ok.  - I'm sorry for the horrible writing.  I'm exhausted and clearly need to hit the sack.  Thanks for all the feedback!"
AmItheAsshole,fmdh8az,t1_fmdgnb6,1585967759.0,"I agree with y'all too.  which is why i was leaving.  He had his drinking rather controlled when we got married and honestly still young.  I was just wondering if saying ""hey - no getting drunk every friday night"" makes me an asshole.  My metric is different than his just by virtue of family backgrounds.  Most people I know who know him would say that yeah once a week is not ok while his family would encrourage it.  Wanted to send it out to the internet for perspective."
AmItheAsshole,fmdgybu,t1_fmdfu4z,1585967557.0,Thanks.  That's where I'm struggling.  I do love him.  Sober him is AMAZING.  I just don't want my kid growing up with a stumbling around dad every weekend.  That's what my husband grew up with and why no one in his family can say no to alcohol and have massive legal or marriage issues because of it.
AmItheAsshole,fmdglso,t1_fmdeho7,1585967307.0,Thanks!  We did go through therapy years ago.  He isn't down for the idea now.  I agree it's a far stretch given his family but that's why I was so clear that I wasn't going down that path.  I don't want my kiddos seeing a drunk as hell dad or having dad burn down the house.
AmItheAsshole,fmdg355,t1_fmddzmn,1585966926.0,Sorry I fixed it for clarity.
AmItheAsshole,fmdg07m,t1_fmdfa93,1585966866.0,Alcoholism is a tricky beast.  It's been multiple times in the past.  He went sober for a while.  We are just on yet another roller coaster and this time he is saying he just wants one night a week going forward to get sloshed. I know that's a gateway but even if it was just one night I am not ok with him being drunk weekly.  There are about 2 months every year that is bad... I'm just tired of the roller coaster.
AmItheAsshole,fmdfkgz,t1_fmdepi7,1585966555.0,how can you ask for info then say it's too much info to read?  LMAO
AmItheAsshole,fmdfgf9,t1_fmdep1g,1585966477.0,I updated.  is it clearer now?
AmItheAsshole,fmdesbp,t1_fmde8df,1585966000.0,He was drinking everynight.  I put my foot down and said I was leaving and now he wants me to be ok with getting trashed one night a week as a compromise.  I'm not ok with this.
AmItheAsshole,fmdenwu,t1_fmde055,1585965914.0,"Sorry first post and irritated.  Not speaking clearly.
On his most recent uptick it was 4 beers nightly with up to 10 on a Friday night.  He would run on 5 hours of sleep (when sober anything under 7 and he is non-functional and complaining).  Within 3 days he got annihilated twice and had to report to work reeking of beer and on little sleep.  He has left burners on in the past and also urinated on me in the past because he was so drunk that he definitely had alcohol poisoning and I almost called the ambulance.  Now it's not to that level but we weren't far from it when I put my foot down again.  He is acting like I am being entirely unreasonable that I think getting drunk EVERY Friday night moving forward is an acceptable plan of action."
AmItheAsshole,fmde3sw,t1_fmddzmn,1585965524.0,4 beers every night on weeknights.  up to 10 on friday/sat.  4 a week I wouldn't care about.  He came back with he will only drink a sixpack on friday nights and that still doesn't feel ok to me.
