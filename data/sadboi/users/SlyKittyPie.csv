Everyone who takes interest in what you are saying or going through are not annoyed by you. I promise. Life, especially now, sucks hard but try living one day at a time. Take time to do something for you, practicing self love and self care at least once a day can help. It could be simple like crafting or painting or a bubble bath with your favorite music on. I am sorry you are going through this. I've been living with mental illnesses for 30+ years and honestly have only gotten real help about 2 years ago. It's quite a ride but it's worth it.
