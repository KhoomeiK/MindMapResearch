Yes, there is a degree of fat shaming in our society but the truth is that obesity is classified as a disease for good reason.

Edit: Wow, it looks like this resonated with a lot people. Thanks for all your responses and for the silver from the kind person. Stay well Everyone.

To answer your questions:
Thankfully, they were not kruger rands. My parents would have kept those safe. They were random old copper coins that had become rare because they were old. I was young and naive and had never thought to value them. They may not have been worth that much at the time, but they were valuable to me for sentimental reasons. They may been worth a few hundred each by now. Who knows.

My sister was into different things at the time, so I don't think she had any clue about coin collecting. It was very mean to throw out my stuff and I think she realised this later on, but I don't resent her for it because we all make mistakes.

Edit2: Thanks for all the warnings and dms about the Nigerian Prince offer. You restored my faith in the goodness of people. I realised it was a scam style post but played along for fun, sorry for causing concern. These scam are dangerous and are the cause of people losing their life savings, thanks for staying vigilant."
