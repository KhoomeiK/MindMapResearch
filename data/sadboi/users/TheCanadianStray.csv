Regarding your girlfriend, I think for the same reason many people like their girlfriend without being able to explain, she likes you. I understand why you’re considering breaking up as I’ve been in a similar situation before and I’d understand why she’d be shattered, but if you truly don’t love her I think it’s best to let her know. In the case it’s something related to your problems, I really suggest you talk about them with her.

I believe a tragic event like depression leaves a scar on you. It’s like a knife. So when it comes around the second time, I believe it inserts itself in the scar and it hurts even more, so your scar would need to heal to prevent worse damage. In other words I think the fact that it hurts more the second time is because you never truly healed from the past and you’re accumulating pains.

In order to find it however, you need to hold on to hope. I know life may feel horrible at the moment, but we’ve got to live with the hopes that someday life might bring about something good, because if we do, someday it might.

There are a few ways to make it better though, the most effective being to focus on your hobbies, in my opinion.

Hope this answers your question"

AskMen,f2adu55,t3_dcj1dx,1570112095.0,"Listen to your kid as he grows up, don’t just ask about grades, ask about how he’s doing, support him when he needs but also learn to give him his space when he wants.
Take an interest in what he does, it shows him you care and listen when he speaks.
Be open with him. I’m not saying you should share everything, but share some things, like that he’ll know you trust him and he’ll have an easier time opening up to you and you’ll be able to have a closer relationship.

Last thing is: always remember to be of help and never a problem (it sounds stupid but many parents do this). Remember you’ll want him to grow up to be happy even though their lives already come with their problems. Make sure to help if you can, but be careful not to add more problems or put more unnecessary pressure on him.

I’d say those are the essentials (basically what my parents did wrong), hope it helps."
