Panicking doesn’t help others to realize what deep shit we are in. Taking care of yourself so you can continue helping the cause.

Take a break from reading books like that. I had to stop listening to the news to stay sane. Be kind to yourself."
bipolar,f17nqwo,t1_f176s9t,1569245705.0,"I’ve never had that problem with kratom. I actually am less stable when I don’t take it. You would need to be taking a lot everyday to have withdrawal symptoms. Everyone’s body is different though.

I’ll take kratom withdrawals over alcohol withdrawals in the blink of an eye. Though I’ve never had kratom wd."
stopdrinking,f0s2x90,t1_f0s27qd,1568897898.0,"Thank you. I have to work today so I'm going to muscle through the next few hours. I have the next two days off luckily and I've asked a friend to come over to help me through this. We're planning on binge watching a show. Maybe cleaning my house if I'm feeling up to it.

These next few days are going to suck."
SuicideWatch,eyui3mp,t1_eyug4oi,1567462747.0,"They are, and have. I’m just feeling bad about inconveniencing them now. Which is super silly to feel, since I know they’d feel 100x worse if I went through with any of it.

Plus the flipping healthcare costs in the US make me scared to even go to the emergency room. Last time it was free (I think) because I make so little money. But if I even made 5k more a year and  had insurance through my employer, a single ER visit would cost 1k."
SuicideWatch,eyufg4d,t1_eyudjex,1567460731.0,"I’m okay. I’ll make it through this. But it’s super dumb I would like to just walk out into the road and have both my legs broken than feel this.

Thanks for your response. It means a lot. I hope you’re okay too."
SuicideWatch,eyucsxr,t1_eyuc768,1567458756.0,It really does. I comparatively have a good life too. I have good people around me. I have my cats. I have a good SO. I just know something is off
bipolar,eytyilg,t3_cynpad,1567448530.0,"Lamictal has been working for me for the past few months. But these past few weeks have been HELL.

I’ve been to the ER twice, have had 5 emotional breakdowns in front of people that in front of I usually successfully hide my problems.

I’ve been trying to keep my drinking habit under control. And I’ve been mildly successful. (I’ve had 12 days sober this month!)

It has to be my meds, either that or my brain chemistry has changed. But my psych basically told me he won’t change anything until I’ve been sober for a month.

UGH this sucks so much. Sorry for venting."

bipolar,exj943g,t1_exitnj5,1566344692.0,"I tried to overdose on my anti-depressants when I was that age. My parents knew too, but chose to ignore it. My mom even let me go to school the next day.

I’m sorry you went through that too."
bipolar,exj8eu7,t3_ct0ka5,1566344251.0,"Thank you for the wake up call. I didn’t know that going off lamictal can cause seizures. 

I have to wait over an hour after my appointment time because my psych is always running behind.

I already know what a missed dose does to me. It’s not fun for anyone."

bipolar,exj702f,t1_exehbuw,1566343374.0,Kratom is pretty helpful
bipolar,exj6wvs,t3_csfhrv,1566343317.0,I don’t think my lamictal is helping anymore. It was for a few months then I bought a car and a switch. And now ive been barricaded in my house since Saturday.

stopdrinking,eweaw2e,t3_cnl8fj,1565318867.0,Thank you for articulating this! I felt a bit miffed when my doc told me its going to get worse before it gets better. I’ve been worse and I’m not going back there.
stopdrinking,ewc236e,t3_cnips4,1565276407.0,"Day 2 for me! I removed a lot temptation by simply giving my fiancé my ID. It's removed a lot of stress on the drive home from work. Do I stop and buy a bottle? Welp guess I can't anyways! I think it's going to save me a lot on groceries too, since I'd buy other items we didn't \*need\* just to cover the fact I was only there for buying wine.

stopdrinking,ew9qxli,t3_cn0d9c,1565229697.0,"Day 1 woo.

**Struggle:** Everything was going just great, I was in a fine mood. Work was good. Still shaking a bit but anxiety under control. Decided to go out shopping after work so I wouldn't be home during the hours that tempt me. Found some cute stuff. Spent more than I should have, but no as much as I would have on booze.

THEN I went to Taco Bell. I figured the heck I like Taco Bell, It'll be fine to eat fast food tonight. I put my order in on the fancy new touch screens since I hate human interaction and wait for my order to come out. As I'm waiting nearly 15 minutes- I can see the kitchen staff fucking around and dropping stuff in the kitchen they're laughing and having to remake orders left and right. When mine was ready they literally flung it on the counter and walked away. And guess what set me off? My stupid nacho fries were cold and stale. I was fuming. I stormed out the door as a manager was coming in and told her the kitchen needed to get their shit together because its a mess and left.

When I got home I threw the food away because I'm sure it wasn't up to food safety standards, the proceeded to start bawling.

I'm a very patient person, I don't send food back if the order is wrong at a restaurant. I consider myself even keel but oh my god if that wasn't one of the worst 0-100 mood swings I've had in years.

I was totally blind-sided and am terrified, but know there will be more to come. I'm not the type of person who gets angry, or at least I didn't consider myself one.

**Triumph:** Day 1! Didn't drink, bought a cute new hamper in the shape of a cat. Got hit on by a lesbian for a minute while out shopping. She liked my timberlands.

**General:** Oof. Tired. I've got work to do yet tonight. But I know I need to be gentle with myself. I still want some goddamn fast food though. After not eating for days on end my appetite is back with a vengeance."
