Repaintings,fqnn2y0,t3_gjmss4,1589497827.0,"Hi, welcome to the board/ community! 

1. I personally use acrylic because clean up is easy and it‚Äôs much easier to remove. A lot of people who use oil make fantastic pieces as well, but I think of it as a more advanced medium. Definitely start with acrylic!

2. That of course comes with practice, and is generally the most difficult aspect of this art form in my experience. Don‚Äôt get too caught up on this, because for as much as I enjoy artist who manage to recreate the same style as the image I also enjoy things that are clearly painted over boldly and different all the same. It‚Äôs honestly a question of art direction and where you want your piece to go. 

3. You absolutely can, just be careful to draw lightly because erasing your marks can be trouble some to cover up if you leave heavy lead marks. 

4. I don‚Äôt think there is such a thing as do‚Äôs or don‚Äôts when it comes to art in general. Have fun and express your self, that‚Äôs all that matters. This community is lovely and it‚Äôs a pretty positive space. Excited to see what you create!"

Anxiety,fkjdibb,t3_eupik4,1584242818.0,"Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

I thought i'd finally post something after following this thread for nearly a month now. This thread has been so helpful to me, a life long anxiety sufferer and a blossoming hypochondriac in the last few months. To many of us, we can have some pretty nasty anxiety on normal days so something this large is admittedly going to be a lot for many of us to handle. I live close to Detroit MI, and there are many cases popping up all around my county. I expect to see the numbers continue to rise, and the future looks bleak but i wanted to share some tips in my own discoveries that I've made in this time of turmoil. 

&#x200B;

\-Stay off of most social media as much as you can. Unfortunately it is impossible to filter your feed without it being mentioned in some shape or form. I love Twitter, but I have personally decided to delete the app off my phone for the time being because it's a siphon of negativity and misinformation. I have found that Instagram being mostly picture based is the safest to use.

\- Take care of yourself. Make sure you are eating and drinking a lot of water. If you allow this commotion to effect your intake you are just going to feel worse.

\- DISTRACTION!! The most important thing, just invest yourself in something that will take your mind off the world, even if it's only temporary. I've noticed that I feel the symptoms coming on, and then when i play a game, read or watch a movie they all seem to disappear. This is clear proof that our mental illness is creating illusions to trick us into thinking we are sicker than we actually are.

&#x200B;

I know a lot of this information is common sense or has already been said, but since this thread has helped me so much i wanted to try to help in anyway I could. Let's all work together to keep this thread as positive as possible. We are all going to be fine, if you look at most of the real statistics that haven't been overblown by the media it's not nearly as bad as it looks. We obviously need to take extreme measures to reduce spread, but once it has run it's course we can all go back to normally and start being anxious about other stuff again. Thanks everyone, stay safe out there and for the love of god wash your hands."

Anxiety,fk200tt,t1_fk1cjev,1583790298.0,"Just a general therapy for the last year but I‚Äôm going to move to someone who is more anxiety based. It is helpful I just need to find someone a little better suited, I have high hopes towards therapy and believe it can be effective if I can allow it to be. I‚Äôm willing to try anything so I will mediate soon. No stomach problems so far, don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs food related as I have been doing well keeping on top of having a healthy balanced diet."
Anxiety,fk1bma2,t1_fk1bdkv,1583776368.0,"In the middle of changing therapists, not on any meds trying to avoid that route if I can. I changed my diet around the same time I started having health issues, don‚Äôt know if it has to do anything with it but it might. It‚Äôs been two months since I started eating healthier so if my body is still reacting negatively to it that would be shocking to me."
