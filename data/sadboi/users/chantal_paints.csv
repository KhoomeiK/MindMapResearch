AskReddit,exd96uw,t3_c1czag,1566170497.0,"My 3 year old has told us for the last year that he sees a ghost every night. He wakes up every night at 3am on the dot. He tells me he's tall, he looks scary, and has weird eyes. Sometimes he's in the corner, and other times he's watching from the hallway. (Our room is across from his 0.0)  He tells me that the ghost shakes him and watches him sleep. During the day he won't go in certain parts of our house because he points and tells us the ghost is in there. 

We're completely freaked out, but he's pretty matter of fact about it now. He used to cry and be really scared, sometimes he still is but for the most part he just wakes us up to tell us where the ghost is. 

We're hoping to move soon because this is way too creepy."
