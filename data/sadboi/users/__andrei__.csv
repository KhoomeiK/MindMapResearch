2. How can the general public help support our medical community on the front lines when this inevitably peaks?

3. Italy is turning away old frail people, because standard triage prefers patients who are likely to recover. Will something similar apply to the uninsured and the homeless in the US?

4. China eventually started diagnosing people purely by CAT scan. It had better specificity than the RNA tests. Are we talking about this at all in the US?
