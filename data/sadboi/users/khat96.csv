bisexualadults,fph6kci,t3_gdat4j,1588615856.0,"I asked my boyfriend, who is younger but is also a bi male. He suggests you put it in your profile to filter out the biphobic assholes, so that the people who match with you are definitely ok with it. He would always make sure people he dated knew he was bi before meeting up and letting things get too far just to make sure there wouldn't be any problems. As for coming out to friends and family, he says that's optional and you can do that whenever you feel comfortable with it. He's open about it to most of his friends if they ask and he is chill with them, but doesn't feel that everyone needs to know. He's dated both men and women, but prefers to date women, so he's similar to you in that sense. If you have any questions you want me to ask him, or to ask me (I'm an AFAB non-binary bisexual), then just lemme know!"

He'd only searched for it because a friend of his was being suspicious of my intentions and thought I'd have something bad posted somewhere, but obviously I did not (because I'm not stupid nor that kind of asshole). Based on that incident, and others, he's dropped that friend and he and I are still going strong!"

Gastroparesis,fj215bl,t3_fb085s,1582932201.0,"I'm 23f, and I have been taking Reglan for a few weeks now. I haven't noticed any particular side effects, except maybe drowsiness sometimes. I recently was off it for a few days (because I didn't ask for a refill in time...oops) and had an attack after just 4 or 5 days of not being on it. So I think it's safe to say it's working for me, since I hadn't had an attack since before starting it. The shakes, tremors, etc. won't start right away though- they often take time to develop, and the longer you're on it the more likely it is you'll get them. So definitely keep an eye out for those symptoms if you do go on it. Best of luck!"
learnspanish,ffh1jpf,t3_etju4y,1579920627.0,"I am not a native speaker, but I have read some stuff on this topic, and asked professors about it in college. 

My understanding of it is that *te quiero* is less serious, but still meaningful- you use it with family, friends, and a significant other to whom you are not married. *Te amo* is what you would use with your spouse. They're differing levels of intensity; *te quiero* is more relaxed and casual, while *te amo* is very intense and passionate."
pansexual,ffez5cg,t1_ffc7dtg,1579871041.0,"From what I understand, as someone who identifies with both terms (but primarily describes themself with the term ""bi"" for simplicity's sake), there is a lot of overlap. 

The definition of ""bisexual"" that I accept (though not the only valid one!) is ""the attraction to same and other genders"", meaning genders that match mine and those that do not (I like this definition because it has two specific categories, which quells the argument that ""bi means two!!!""). Another acceptable definition is ""attraction to two or more genders."" 

For pansexual, I define it is ""attraction to ALL genders,"" which overlaps with both of those definitions of bisexual in some individuals. 

Both sexualities can be attracted to nonbinary people, and obviously both can be attracted to binary trans people (trans women are women! trans men are men!). It is valid for both to have preferences for a particular gender, it is valid for both to have ""types"" within genders, and it is valid for both to not consider gender at all when determining attraction to someone.

The gist of what I'm saying is- sometimes, there is no difference at all. For me, both terms are fitting. For some people, the distinction is important- a person who describes themself as bisexual may be only attracted to two genders (not necessarily just men and women, it could be women and nonbinary people, or men and agender people, etc.)- but there is significant overlap between the two terms and that is okay!"
pansexual,feoprtt,t3_eq57al,1579303659.0,"I identify with both bi and pan! I also call myself queer a lot (and also gay, but that's just as an umbrella term). I feel like both terms can overlap a lot, and in me they definitely do."

queer,f7ab8db,t3_dv38ku,1573525074.0,"""Queer"" is slur that has been reclaimed by some LGBT+ people as an umbrella term that can describe anyone who falls into the LGBT+ community. It is also an identity; if someone describes themself as ""queer"", that basically means ""I'm not straight."" The term ""genderqueer"" also exists as a similar identity with regards to gender; it basically means ""I'm not cisgender.""   


TL;DR: queer is a reclaimed slur used by some members of the LGBT+ community"
Spanish,f77x7c0,t1_f77wz87,1573478960.0,"There is no verb-conjugation to indicate future, is what I meant. The ""will be doing x"" and ""be going to x"" are both present tense, using auxiliary verbs to indicate a future time. They are considered progressive aspect, I think. That is for any form of the verb where you include a form of ""be"" and the affix ""-ing""."
Spanish,f77vskw,t1_f77e7p5,1573477563.0,"There is no proper future tense in English; there is only present and past tense, then ""going to x"" or ""will be doing x"" and similar constructs for a future ""tense"".

polyamory,f0wjer7,t3_d6yrsi,1569008529.0,"My boyfriend (23) and I (23, nb) recently opened our relationship to poly; it's his first experience with it and so far the most positive one I've had. But he's struggling with feelings of jealousy and inadequacy, as well as the nagging voices in his head telling him I get and choose to spend so much more time with my new girlfriend than with him (which is not true, and he is aware of this; I see him every weekend for roughly 48 hrs, and I see her at most for a few hours one day a week and 30 minutes another). 

He's working through his emotions, and we recently came out to his friends as poly so he has more people than just me to talk to if he needs it, but it's tough to see him struggling. Especially when he's been so adamant about being open to poly, and sometimes it looks like he's going to try and back out of it- he assures me he isn't, but I worry still. It's been significantly better since he met her and they got along (and might possibly have a semi-platonic semi-sensual relationship in the future), but it's still a little rocky. My anxiety is affecting how I view this and probably blowing it out of proportion, but it's still a concern for me nonetheless."
