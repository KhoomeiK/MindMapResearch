PsychMelee,fr603o6,t3_gmtqoq,1589917572.0,"I share your criticisms, personally I chose to study Psychology already aware of them and with a very clear goal of specializing in Psychoanalysis, being critical of Psychology and Psychiatry inside academia and being more useful for the Anti-Asylum movement in my country.


I'm also far left (anarchist) and I get where you are coming from, what keeps me going is keeping in mind that we NEED critical voices inside Psychology, just like any field, scientific or not, if people are not constantly criticizing and trying to change what needs change it will stop evolving.


I personally really like Psychoanalysis because I feel like they are much more critical of status quo and they were really important voices in the reform of Psychiatry and of the way we deal with mental health  in my country, so they are probably more respected here than they are in some other places lol


I don't know where you are from or how popular it is there, but Cultural-Historical Psychology sounds like the type of thing right up your alley, if it's not something you are already into. Also Frantz Fanon, who I recently learned about and deals with issues of psychopathology of colonization is pretty damn cool.


Mainstream Psychology has a LOT of problems, but Psychology also has some amazing tools for us to understand and deal with social, political, economical and cultural issues, it is worth fighting mainstream Psychology for the narrative so it doesn't go to waste."

psychoanalysis,fqyk79k,t3_gl9dt4,1589749924.0,"I'm in a very similar situation, just recently started Psychology when really what I want is Psychoanalysis.



It is a bit frustrating, whenever my professors mention Psychoanalysis is always in a dismissive way and some of the methods and conclusions I've learned irked me out a bit. But to be fair I'm also learning a lot of cool things and learning to respect more the scientific part of Psychology and understand why it needs to exist.



I still very much am critical of the assumption that the scientific method is necessarily the best for everything, specially therapeutic goals and of the over-medicalization and over-patologization of human experiences. But to me an important part of being critical of something (specially inside academia) is understanding and finding respect for the thing you are critical.


My main advice would be for you to keep an open mind, but still always question the things you think should be questioned. I notice in my classmates and even some professors, that they don't really ask the more philosophical questions like ""Why is the scientific method ""inherently"" better?"", ""What is being mentally healthy or mentally ill?"".


Even if you end up enjoying more modern Psychology, questioning things is the only way any field can envolve and change, a lot of people in scientific fields forget that and treat science as the absolute unchanging truth.


Also, I don't know how useful this tip is for you, but depending on your means and where you are from you could take a look at foreign universities. I know that Argentina is somewhat big on Psychoanalysis, they also have public Universities that either don't charge foreign students or charge very little. Depending it could end up cheaper than studying where you are from. It's just that I thought of studying there for a while, so I like to give people the information that it is a possibility."

When leftists organize and act they risk prison and death, they can be called terrorists or acused of violence, you don't want Facebook or Twitter to have things that could make your situation worse and any smart leftist organization knows this.



If you want to see leftists acting you need to join a grassroots movement, almost by definition the left needs to organize and unite in order to do and achieve anything.

You are allowed to have your boundaries, but I also think that you should listen and believe your partner when she says is not about the intimacy for her, but about meditation. Asking her to stop it may be asking her to stop doing something that brings her peace and helps her deal with things.

One thing I noticed is that most people are able to see that there's many issues with the way we deal with education because of their own experiences with it, it's very broad and vague because well, the education is not actually good enough to help people developed critical thinking and interest in educating yourself for the sake of knowledge, not many people are familiar with the field of Pedagogy for instance. So most people have sort of a gut feeling that something is not right about the way and goals of education in many places, they just don't have good or enough tools to make an informed and critical argument about it.


It's kinda funny because Paulo Freire actually discuss this, how education need to be freeing and help students achieve autonomy, how education shouldn't be focused only on passing basic information to students and teach them to conform to the norms of their culture, but also to create knowledge and help students learn the process of creating knowledge and being critical.


I was lucky enough to study in schools that were heavily influenced by Paulo Freire when I was a kid, it's noticeable when I talk with people from bad public schools that even when they are really intelligent and smart, they have a much harder experience at higher education than me, because critical thinking comes easy to me, it was how I was taught to learn since I was a kid, learning it at University or later in life can be very traumatic, it challenges your worldview and how you process knowledge."

LeopardsAteMyFace,fpaodae,t1_fpa8e63,1588452335.0,"I think it's more because one is dealing with America the empire of the world and the other is dealing with Brazil and nobody gives a fuck. Trump would definitely do absolutely nothing if he could, but he doesn't want the US to lose its power and for it to become actually chaotic, Bolsonaro doesn't care, he wants chaos so he can be excused to do as much horrible things as he wants."
LeopardsAteMyFace,fpao4gs,t1_fp9ywzz,1588452188.0,"They are the same, the main difference amongst them is the difference in culture between US and Brazil.


Steve Bannon helped Bolsonaro a lot, and when you look at the things they do and say (specially on social media) is very obvious that they have either the same team or teams that work closely together working for them.



They have the very same tactics, more than once I saw them sharing almost the exactly same meme only a few weeks apart. Sometimes Trump does it first and sometimes it's Bolsonaro, which makes it clear that it isn't that Bolsonaro is trying to copy Trump, they are both working for the same interests and with the same people.



When you watch what both of them are doing is somewhat predictable what they are going to do."

nonmonogamy,fp6zdj0,t3_gbnx7p,1588361262.0,"Thank you!


I've been a secondary and it really annoys me when I see people discussing secondaries without thinking about how they are people with feelings too.


When I was a secondary the couple was non monogamous for years already, but I was the first long term girlfriend of the guy. I don't know if it was on purpose, but basically all information he would give me about what they discussed is that his wife was jealous of me, didn't particularly liked me and didn't want to meet me. It made me feel like shit and really put me and his wife in antagonist positions, even tho we had never met or talked to each other.


I couldn't even express how I felt about that, how I felt it was unfair that she made up her mind about me even tho she didn't know me and how I understood she felt threaded by me because I was the new relationship, but I also felt threatened by her because she had a decade long relationship with him and he would always put her first.


Whenever I talked about that he got super defensive as if I just called his wife a bitch and said I should not feel like that. He never gave me a reason to not feel like that, just basically said it was wrong to have those feelings.


That's the main reason why me and my current bf took so long to open up to secondaries romantically, I know how shitty it can feel so I didn't want to put someone in this position unless I was more sure I would do all I could to have a healthy relationship with them."

Seriously, what does ""international world"" even mean? There's still very much a lot of cultural differences amongst people, if that's such a major thing for you just say so the people you are meeting, but entire cultures aren't going to change just because a random person from a random country is not happy with it, culture is some old shit.


It's really weird how violent your answer to cultural differences are, most Brazilians it they invited someone and they show up on time (meaning early) would just have a laugh and use the time for some bonding and discuss the weird cultural differences, they wouldn't get half as pissed as you are right now."
todayilearned,fp6u72l,t1_fp6cyo0,1588358661.0,"Most people are on time for work because most people don't want to be fired lol.


But about Minas is because it is the countryside, it's harder for people to go places because there's few public transportation (and people usually drink, so no cars), so they need to plan their outings better and consider the time it takes to go from one place to another.


But when you are in the capital city people start being late, there's still not as much transportation but staying all night out is not uncommon so people often do that instead of going home the same day."
todayilearned,fp6tb9l,t1_fp6fjjg,1588358231.0,"I mean, it can be annoying, but when your culture is like that you learn how to deal with.


For instance is very common if you are going to a bar or club for people who live closer to meet at each other's house so they can get ready and a bit drunk together beforehand. So usually people will show up in small groups instead of alone, being alone in public while waiting for others is not that much of a issue."

They are very important workers and the only reason why their work isn't more meaningful is because the system is fucked and doesn't care about quality education, this is hardly the teachers fault who often are only trying to do what they think is right even tho they get paid shit."

Honestly is fucking frustrating discussing with Americans online, even the ones that call themselves ""leftists"" are really deep into american exceptionalism and either completely ignore or do absolute nothing about their imperialism.

I know ""poor man's idea"" is not literal, but Elon Musk is the rich man idea of what an intelligent person should be like too. He gives people the things we were promised by a more optimistic view of the future, specially for rich people.



The Hyperloop for instance is basically the same idea of trains but with extra steps and less useful. It doesn't actually solve anything, like well funded public trains would, it just make people believe in ""fucking magic""."

sex,foy0qcm,t3_ga5ayz,1588162334.0,"Yeah it is, no the people involved don't need to be like ""I consent to this"" in a robotic voice every time they do something different. It all depends on the prior communication and intimacy of people who are having sex.


If is the first time they are having sex and discussed nothing prior it is best to ask consent every time, but asking consent don't have to be boring unless the person asking is boring. ""Your butt is so hot, let's do doggy so I can appreciate it better?""; ""I'm dying to ear your pussy, may I?""; etc. 


If it's someone you have communicated a lot already and has intimacy with obviously you can take a lot more shortcuts, but also asking consent can be sexy as fuck so why not do it?


I'm in a D/S relationship and my Master still uses creative ways of basically asking my consent before we start playing. It shouldn't be that hard for vanilla couples."
