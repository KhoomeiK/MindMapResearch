writing this because no one knows I exist, and I just wanted people to know that I was here. That I tried to be a good capable person, but that I wasn't strong enough to stay that way.

For some this lockdown life is just a couple months of struggling and after they will go back to their sort of normal lives. For me, I have been living like this for so long that I think this feels like a natural time to end things.

I developed serious social anxiety and depression when I was 16. I am now 25. Fuck me 10 years already? Everyone told me it would get better if I just stuck with it. Doctors, nurses, teachers, mental health professionals, police officers, god, but none of them stay around long.

In that time it has robbed me of friends, family, my competency, my academic brilliance, my good looks, a bright future, my curiosity, love, memories - it's left me a complete utter husk.

All I do is wake up and stare at the white wall until I can go back to sleep, even though all I have are nightmares. I try to cope by watching youtube videos of other people living their lives or laughing with their friends and try to smile and laugh along.

But I'm not dumb, whenever I turn off my phone I'm back to being stuck in these 4 walls alone, no other human voices. You spend so much time pretending to hang out with other people you forget you, yourself, haven't spoken all day.

This feels like the end of a 10 year-long road where I have tried to keep up appearances and smile just for random strangers and say I'm fine when I'm literally fucking homeless, I'm tired of my life being so fucked and not being able to ask for help because my throat tightens up and my mind and body have separated. I'm sick and tired of always losing the things I love.

And no one ever asked how I was, I looked after my schizophrenic mum, I helped my brother get into Cambridge when he was struggling, I stopped my family becoming homeless when my parents stopped being responsible adults.

And now it's been years since they abandoned me when I needed them most and reach out and asked for help. I remember when I would have died for them because their lives meant more to me than my own did. Now I'm just left to disappear. Like I never existed.

My name was Rumi. The guy everyone knew who was goofy as fuck but also the smartest guy in class. The guy who never took himself too seriously but was serious when making sure the people around him were okay and taken care of.

politics,fp70s4u,t1_fp6yv66,1588361971.0,"and this is where people usually fall apart...   
something being subjective, doesn't mean its invalid and worthless. rather, it just means it is immeasurable. For proper science to work, something needs to be objectifiable, but not everything exists within the limits of science.  Take for example the consciousness, or concepts of free will.  If one disregards the subjective... then the criminal who kills 30 people is ""not responsible for his own actions"" for cause and effect determined him to be so."

politics,fp456sb,t1_fp415wf,1588291913.0,"nope.  I believe religion might be contrived, but the idea of God being contrived not so much.  there are too many questions that are unanswered for me to conclude that God doesn't exist.  I much prefer to believe that God exists then to believe that God doesn't exist.  given that God might exist, then it becomes possible that people might have messages coming from God.  What I think the problem is, is a lot of people tend to interpret messages based upon a selfish perspective, as opposed to a holistic viewpoint."
politics,fp3tem4,t1_fp3nkp6,1588285465.0,people approach the Bible in the wrong way.  Jesus himself pointed out in the New testament that most of what was written was tradition but not law.  what is law is literally the ten Commandments and the rest is tradition.  so all that misogyny and what not one can lay at the feet of tradition and corruption of purpose. the whole message of Jesus is to look at the essence of the law as opposed to the technicality of the law.

either way the key is to truly decide if what engineering can get you is what you truly want or if you want something else. no one will suffer or reap the benefits of your choices except you and those who depend on you. by fully defining what you want, the anxiety falls away, because of you are incapable you can train yourself to be capable, and if you're undisciplined, you can teach yourself discipline.  what it all boils down to is if you have the will and desire to make your dreams reality.

intj,fourn7p,t1_fou8lyl,1588089260.0,"you touched on the point I was making.  If you're looking for the clinginess or the drama, INTJ probably isn't for you.  For example; if I told you ""I love you"" it means ""I love you"".  I don't feel the need to tell you twice, as I've decided that ""I love you"" and that really won't change unless something drastic occurs.  I won't be building shrines to you or constantly pandering to your need to hear those words over and over, as I would expect you to understand that I meant those words when I said them, and the importance of those words.  I won't be going out of my way to make small talk that reassures you... but at the same time if you ask me to do something that I wouldn't do for anyone else because it annoys me or w.e... I'd probably do it, because ""I love you"".  Now I may not hold your hand in public, or say annoying lovey dovey BS.  I may even ghost you from time to time, but if you ever ""need"" something from me... I'd rise up to the occasion and get it done, even at my own expense, because of the fact that ""I love you"".   

Now the above is only applicable to me really as it is a first person perspective, but if MBTI is to be trusted then I'd assume how I am generalizes to my type somewhat."
