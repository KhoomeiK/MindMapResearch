TalkTherapy,fedrasw,t3_eombux,1579018201.0,"Your therapeutic relationship would have been boundaried and professional. Often when we have experienced relational trauma (and we all have, in some way), getting the undivided attention and care from someone, like a therapist, feels fantastic. 
Therapists attune to you and your needs, which may be something you haven't felt before or for a long time. 

I'm guessing you won't know much about her non-professional personality, and interactions in therapy are completely different from those in the outside world. 

My guess is that it's transference, but it is very common and speaking about this in therapy can often be helpful. 
It is important to remember that your therapist would not be able to have a friendship or relationship with her clients without losing her licence, however. 
Maybe consider exploring if you might feel safer projecting romantic feelings towards someone unnatainable.

She may ask you which attributes you like about her, and how you can find/nurture them in yourself and others?

And maybe whether your current relationships/friendships are healthy, safe and respectful, in a similar way to the professional relationship you've experienced in therapy."

TalkTherapy,fe5kjza,t3_ento7s,1578870605.0,"If you can, go to another session and try to talk about this with them. It may feel difficult, but you may get some really useful insight as a result. 

Your relationship with your therapist will closely mirror important relationships in your life, and working through some really difficult, painful interactions in therapy can really help you on the outside. 


Hang in there :)"
