Everyone is telling me I'm lazy, which is not true! No one knows what's in my head, and I feel could do anything productive in this world, but if I stop for just a day, I'm lazy!

I feel like there no point in doing anything anymore, everything started crushing down from 5th grade from bullying to my grades falling apart, I fell apart!

I'm almost 27 and had multiple jobs non of which lasted more than a week except for one  where I kinda felt ok even tho it was demanding high effort! And recently I had a chance at a good job, I was finally accepted somewhere with all my flaws, i was mentally getting better, but again all crumbled down when this crisis started, I didn't get the job I was 1 day from signing the papers!
