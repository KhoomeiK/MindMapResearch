You can’t walk into a store, ask someone for help and then treat them like shit as if their only purpose in life is to not help you. Act like a decent person. Understand you aren’t the only important thing in the world and that a lot of people have it just as bad if not worse than you. Stop talking down to people who are literally paid to give a shit about you because no one else will."

SanJoseSharks,fhu2fqv,t3_f4lyzm,1581881003.0,"It’s unfortunate that the league is still hung up on his antics as a young up and coming NHL’er. Kane understands this is a game, he has fun with it. He plays hard the way the game was meant to be played. Too many inconsistencies with the refs. They look at him and think “ well this guy is always trouble” and then unfairly penalize him for things. 
Hey Ryan “dog shit “ reeves gets to run his mouth and the league lets him pretend like he belongs here. That’s what gets me. 

Kane is unbelievably talented and just because he gets mixed up in some aggressive play, fans and the NHL want to believe that because of said antics that his skill is no longer relevant. 

The NHL is growing more and more whack as the years go on. The talent is getting better but these inconsistent rules are getting in the way of that."

vegan,f6kfnag,t3_drkhyw,1572911541.0,"Though it is important to share the suffering of animals. I think it’s important to remember that not every vegan documentary needs to be that forward. As a vegan I think it’s important that we take small steps. Game changers seeks to prove that overall health and performance can increase due to a plant based diet. If this approach gets more people on board that’s what matters. Not the fact that they don’t mention animal suffering. In fact the animal suffering isn’t essentially relevant to that documentary. It doesn’t help support their point as far as athletic performance. That’s what Dominion and Earthling is for. 

I believe we should focus on the fact that Game Changers is showing to take a small step towards a plant based community and world. Often times these animal suffering videos are too aggressive for meat eaters and we need to remember that change takes time in slow increments. We must remain sensitive to the fact that changing what we have been raised to think is ok, is actually a slow time intensive process. Game changers to me is exactly what the general public needs to see in order to start the conversation about the other dirty aspects of the meat and dairy industry."
