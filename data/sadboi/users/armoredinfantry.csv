midlifecrisis,f4chifq,t3_dkb13y,1571529175.0,"I sure does sound like a MLC based on you're description. The idea that maybe you've given up your youth, and you're trying to (seemingly) feel young once more is kind of along the line of that whole ideal. One thing about it though is that just because your tastes have changed, doesn't mean that it's a bad thing. One thing I would say if you believe your marriage is strong enough, is talk to your partner about this. Your feelings are important, and if he's a good husband, he'll recognize that fact. As well if you decide to discuss it with him, it's important not to assign blame. MLC are things that just happen to people, and how you talk to him is just as important as how he talks to you.

Another thing to consider is that your dreams together were important for a reason. Whatever goals the pair of you had set at some point can change. There's nothing that says they can't.

So if you work it out together then great. If you go it alone, I'm here on the other end most nights if you need to dump. Truth be told I'm in the midst of my own MLC so I feel you. 

Good luck."
