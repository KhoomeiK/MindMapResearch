AnorexiaRecovery,fqxkptx,t1_fqu7nad,1589733802.0,"Thanks for reply! I’m so sorry you’ve felt like this too. 

I felt like my ED was fake unless I was in inpatient. Even when I was inpatient I still felt fake. I think I could be hours from death and I’d still feel like I was faking. 

It’s definitely taken a while to even come to the point of being aware of me and ED being separate people, but I constantly work on it!!

The weird thing is, I didn’t really want to be in inpatient any longer! Like I did enjoy the security and the support I had there and that I could finally eat because I had “permission”/ I had to, but I also didn’t like being so cooped up. If anyone suggested to me I had to go back, I’d be conflicted with some sick sense of pride and validation of my ED but I’d also run for the hills at the same time. 🤷🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️"

I want to live a fun life, to not isolate, and to not think about food from dawn to dusk and even in my dreams sometimes.

I was in treatment about a year ago before I relapsed, and made some amazing friends, but they stopped talking to me and I'm not sure if it's because they just want to move on, or if they literally died. I'm too afraid to search for obituaries because I'm afraid of what I might find.

This disease kills and even though it's so easy to say ""oh that won't happen to me"", you can be ""fine"" until you're not fine anymore, and it can happen so fast as OP's story describes.

BorderlinePDisorder,fck91t5,t3_ehhrnq,1577719873.0,"I deleted my instagram (which I never really used anyways other than to see how great everyone but me had it), and deactivated my facebook about 7 months ago (after some rando told me to go kill myself :( )

. It was hard and I had some serious FOMO at the beginning, but holy shit it has changed me so much.

You hit the nail right on the head when you wrote that anyone who needs to contact you has your info! I still use messenger to chat with friends and family, but no more endlessly scrolling into deeper pits of misery. I deactivated my facebook instead of deleting in case I wanted to go back to it, and I highly doubt I will.

Life has still been hard AF, but it's a lot better than life being hard plus the added misery of comparison of social media."

When I’m feeling decent and actually enjoy something, my brain tells me I’m faking my depression and anxiety because heaven forbid I be happy for 0.002 milliseconds. And then I too get run over, but with a steam roller"

AnorexiaNervosa,fc68imj,t3_egf19o,1577474722.0,"Hey! Do you have a thrift shop or charity shop (whichever it’s called where you are) near you? 

If you’re into thrifting, maybe try there! Cheap, and you can find cool AF stuff 😊. Ive found styles at thrift stores that I didn’t even realize I liked haha. 

EDs and clothing is hard 😢 especially on a budget, I totally feel ya. 

Hope you have a lovely day/night!

Ps I love your pjs!!"
