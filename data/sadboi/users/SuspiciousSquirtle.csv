antiwork,fecxeef,t3_eobdfe,1578988479.0,"$9.38 minimin wage an hour with a four day work week of 32 hours averages with the minimum wage work week over the standing minimum wage pay for 40 hour work weeks. leaving people with a Ton of more time for family,  friends, and all the other good things in life. If the companies where really smart they'd bring it up around $12. 

You want a good economy that's how it happens.  I think initially you'd see a decline in profits which is to be expected, but once people have more money and time to spend it comfortably, I think they'd be making those profits back not to mention the obvious rise in quality of life.

 This would depend on the company's agreeing not to raise prices tho, which I don't think we could trust any of them to do. Honestly if a big company in America would provide this, I feel like they'd be able to snag talent from rival companies. Treating people well is how you create loyalty.

 Yes wages in general should go up, most people will say it's not fair for those on top if their wages don't increase too. I think that would just create inflation, what I think it boils down to is that in our current system there's quite a lot of people left wishing for a bigger piece of the pie. mostly due to the fact a few people want a piece 20,000 times bigger than other people's because ya know ""status and stuff"".  That's basically the framework for an invisible dystopian/feudalist state complete with royalty and nobility. 

Think about it this way tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of dollars is nothing to these people. Now ask yourself what would you, a friend, or almost anyone would do for that kind of money. The shear temptation of it is baffling. Now think about that kind of power. 

What kind of person needs that and is afraid of losing it?

Some of you may be thinking ""Hey what if I'm going on a date!"" Well consider this your date May have family or friends who work in the industry or maybe they were raised by someone who worked as a waitress it may be seen as a huge red flag to them if you ignore the tip now you may at this point be wondering why YOU should have to pay them and not the employer YOUR right you shouldn't it's a bullshit practice and should be ended"
