AskReddit,fr0gzzz,t3_glr6jd,1589795327.0,"I think something like Shadow of the Colossus could be interesting. There’s little story but full of action, beauty and something’s off although you build with the character. He’s trying to resuscitate or bring someone back from the death essentially. Only described as a maiden and there’s only few limited interactions. They use a language or dialect unfamiliar to anyone in the world. You find out the horse ride was to a forbidden place where he took her is  said to be dangerous and full of secrets. The rider converses with some entity hearing of a miracle that could bring back the girl. Only it comes at a cost it says. The protagonist or Wander as he’s known is doing deed after deed slaying these huge almost structure like beings since that’s what the entity said. Besides the “entity” he converses with he only has his noble steed. You show how he overcomes so much and finds out he was tricked. All hell breaks loose as the Colossi weren’t really evil, they only defending themselves. The village elder with a group where already in route to to stop any bad things. Suffice to say they show up seeing many dark spirits pass through the protagonist Wander. He becomes a evil entity and a fight breaks out trying to seal him away. Many die after a climatic fight, but in the end the villagers win. Everyone either dead or alive are gone from the picture. Unbeknownst to everyone the maiden lying on the altar is greeted by Wander’s noble steed. She sees there’s commotion and has no idea what happened. She goes with the horse to see a baby lying where Wander’s body would’ve laid. She picks up the baby cradling it and heads away from the temple. A smile both on her face and the baby giggling.

It’s classic in someone is trying to save someone from the grave. We don’t know the circumstances or why this came to be. The language spoken by the entity, Wander and the villagers is not a real language in that it’s borrowed ancient ones if you’d like it to be. Beautiful scenery, adventure of discovery and doing it all with a horse, a sword and a bow. The Colossi are always obviously huge and they attack as they’re approached. They’re purposely menacing exerting the hero to his limits. You see the wear and tear on his body including his spirit. He may not know, but we as the viewers see his skin turning paler almost like a vampire. He sacrifices everything only to be tricked, the villagers or tribe arrive too late to stop the madness. Good overcomes evil when you thought it was that from the start. The beautiful maiden lives again at the faintest moments of the story. It goes on to show she’s going on. Life continues and even though she doesn’t show it. The maiden is grateful to be alive. 


That’s a random example of a game I just butchered lol. One of a bunch that I think story where a little bit can be just enough. You want a story that strikes something human in us? Unfortunately the genre is saturated already although the Last of Us had a great story imo. I enjoyed it and I’ll admit I didn’t like games where I babysat like say Resident evil 4. You get this reaction of this kid you don’t even know to find a supposed cure as she’s the only one immune to the plague of zombie esque creatures. Joel already cynical after when it started since you start out with his daughter. If you see where I’m going by the time he meets Ellie she’s not “around.” Anyways I’m rambling and incoherent sorry.

Have you ever seen that interview she was going to give and she gets word that Muammar Gaddafi’s dead? She was already being recorded and she boasted in a way that I imagine a sociopath does. To clarify, I think crazy can spot crazy if that makes sense. I won’t lie I would much rather of had her than the dude currently as president. She’s very smart and regardless of what she does, Hilary thinks long term.  I can only imagine who she’d surround herself with. I think a lot less people would bitch about her. By that I mean what she’s implementing, like policies and handling say this crisis etc. She’s been in the game before and knows how it works. All of this guy’s team are people he knows which is ridiculous. To use a crude analogy: That’s like if i had a dog and had to assign a head of security to protect the neighborhood. Well I know my dog and he’s been with me for years. Ahh fuck it he’ll be head of security. Now I’ll just open the door and he’s out there. That’s trump logic and thought. No experience for the jobs these people are holding or even have knowledge of what their job title is. The president damn sure doesn’t. Jared with all the crap he’s supposedly gonna fix and “knows” trying to educate people in press conferences. Again, I’m very tired and digress. Hilary has her faults however, I think she would’ve had more of a positive impact than Trump. That’s my opinion. To each their own I always say. Just to be fair I don’t think anyone wants to be in that chair. This pandemic will not have heroes as leaders. Heroes are the ones who died helping, the ones on the frontlines and experiencing trauma trying to save lives. It’s like the Sword of Damocles. Heavy is the head that wears the crown except this is life not a Hollywood show or something. Trump doesn’t even know what a politician is or the job title of serving the people/for the good of the people/nation. Expanding relations with other countries. Trying to unite us instead of dividing everyone. I think the people who put him where he is have no idea what can of worms they’ve opened

He’s the one who left more of a mess and Obama did little as he reinforced it. At least you could almost believe his bullshit. Trump though? You can’t take him seriously period. Maybe I’m alone but I can’t bring myself to respect that dude. He’s funny to watch sure so that’s the only thing I’ll give him points for. Never seen so much crap about immigration in a condensed one term than his. He’s the least informed guy in every room he’s in. I mean most others in office at least tried. He’s like a student who just shows up to avoid the truant officer from coming to his house. He dislikes reading unless it’s something praising himself. Sorry but I digress.

The shock, adrenaline and passing out are amazing components of our physiology. The fact that the brain can recover and you can’t put in words what exactly you felt that “day” is weird yet fascinating. All you remember was it was the worst imaginable pain ever, but remembering how it felt is probably not healthy. So I guess in the end our brain protects us as much as it can.
