Vindicta,fo1qm0v,t1_fo1olwj,1587439208.0,"Well... both. My brother (and his friends who also happen to be incredibly attractive... good looking guys usually befriend other good looking guys) have managed to stay friends with only two or here girls over the past ten, fifteen years. The girls he‚Äôs not attracted to, he has managed to stay friends with them because they happen to have something they love in common (in my brothers case, it‚Äôs photography and roller derby). The girls that he is attracted to, he has stayed friends with them because he truly likes them as people (or who he thinks they are...he idealizes women that he hasn‚Äôt slept with) but the main reason he has stayed friends with them is because he hopes that eventually they might date. 

In the end though, these friendships won‚Äôt last and as he‚Äôs gotten older, they haven‚Äôt managed to stay in touch. Some of this has to do with him being in and out of relationships, the women being in and out of relationships, friends move away, etc. 


For me, the men that I am friends with are either gay or they‚Äôre attracted to me. I‚Äôm not bragging. I mean, a lot of my male ‚Äúfriends‚Äù probably wouldn‚Äôt stay friends with me if we were to do anything sexual. A few of them would want to actually date me, I believe but it‚Äôs really hard to know for sure. I think right know, with the quarantine going on, it‚Äôs become much, much easier for girls/women to figure out which guys actually do care about you as a person and which guys just want to use me for instant gratification. If they continue to contact you and check up on you and aren‚Äôt asking for pictures or sending lewd messages, then that‚Äôs a good sign that they actually care about you and are likely interested but care about ‚Äúyou‚Äù, your entire package (your personality and your looks). ‚ù£Ô∏è"

30PlusSkinCare,fneee47,t1_fndysjy,1586887878.0,"Just to add to this good advice... make sure you wear a physical blocker sunscreen every day (30 plus) or you will burn, etc. 

Also, when I started using Tazorac (similar to Tretinoin and not as common for some reason although I‚Äôve personally had better experiences with it), the cream didn‚Äôt work at all so I quickly got on the strongest gel and even in just a few weeks, my skin became more even, smoother, i had a glow, people complimented me on my skin for the first time in my life). This was after... over 15 years of painful cystic acne, milia, scarring and skin discoloration from picking)

Anyway! Hah my point is... if your skin is sensitive to it (whether it‚Äôs Tretinoin or Tazorac), I highly recommend using a ‚Äúbuffer‚Äù such as moisturizer (one without actives), homeoplasmine (the European/superior version of Aquaphor), or my favorite, Bepathen (which is technically for diaper rashes but it‚Äôs used in the US, in France and the UK to heal burns, tattoo wounds, chapped lips, and unlike Aquahor, it doesn‚Äôt just lock in moisture but it also moisturizes and has far superior ingredients.
