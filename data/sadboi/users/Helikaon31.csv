writing,f8bgjra,t1_f7qh295,1574436360.0,Really interesting. I found myself reading the final paragraph multiple times to try and understand if there was something within it that I was missing in terms of a metaphor with the bus. Besides one line that had a grammatical error (“like a wire that everyone has was simply never connected in her”) I felt that it sometimes shifted between 3rd person narrative and 1st person. Also not sure if the amount of repetition throughout was intentional (I’m guessing so) but otherwise a really meaningful and emotional exploration of a difficult character. Despite them feeling void of emotion it seems that was the very reason they felt it necessary to shield themselves and others of misery.
