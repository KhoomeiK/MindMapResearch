movies,fqrvz0m,t3_gkgdfu,1589593059.0,Mildly disappointed that this isn't an adaptation of the hilarious shitshow that is the book.
evangelionmemes,fqmgf35,t1_fqmc7uj,1589477024.0,"""-it is entirely possible that Shinji experienced weeks, months or even decades inside Instrumentality, and only returned to the real world much later, and might have spent some time alone in the beach before Asuka showed up, as some elements in the scene indicate:

Misato's cross is rusted, or more specifically, the nail that is holding it. It has been suggested that this could merely be blood washed over on the cross, as LCL is said to resemble blood multiple times. However, the fact that rust is specifically falling from the nail is telling, because it means that either there has been enough time for a nail to rust, or, alternatively, if Shinji found the nail already rusted, the water or humidity could have made the rust spill on the cross. Regardless, there needs to at least have been enough time for the rust to drip down in the first place.
There are several pieces of wood of an unexplained nature. Shinji states that the reason he wants to return to the real world is because he wants to see his friends and the people he loves again because at least there he will know his feelings are real, even if he risks rejection and failure. As explained below, those are actually grave markers Shinji has erected in memory of the other major characters, though Rei and Kaworu are not included. Presumably, the one with Misato's cross is supposed to represent Misato. Shinji might have believed, for a time, that nobody was coming back and he was doomed to be alone, so finding Asuka on the beach would come as a surprise because it would have proven him wrong. This could also explain why he decided to choke her - to find out if she was real. A perfect ""doll"" Asuka inside Instrumentality would not react, and accept any of his wishes, including killing her, as inside Instrumentality there is no individuality, thus Asuka might not have a will of her own. But not only does she react, but she also does so with compassion. This proves to Shinji that he is no longer alone, and that she is indeed real.
The moon cycles change between the first post-Impact scene when Lilith is dying to the ending scene. They seem to indicate at least two weeks have passed between those scenes. Admittedly, it is possible that the Moon was merely being seen from another angle, and this would give the viewer a different impression of the actual cycle it was in, so it is not very strong evidence.
It is still hard to pinpoint a specific timeframe, but Shinji would take at least a few hours to gather wood and erect the grave markers. Unlike the moon cycles, this is actually mentioned in the storyboards, so we can be certain at least this happened.""

Taken from the EvaGeeks page on the final scene. Worth a read if you're interested. It's pretty much how I feel about it, I believe that some amount of time did pass before Asuka came back.

You can also change the settings so that it only chooses certain maps for it if you want to learn particular ones.

The game is rough at first for everyone, and the issue of being put in ongoing games with higher level players is something that applies to all ranks, not just newcomers, so don't worry too much about that. It's just a consistent frustration with the game. Once you unlock the ability to play Unranked, you'll be given a far more consistent playlist with a smaller selection of maps."

The film frequently shows the lead characters, who are made out to be the heroes and the sympathetic ones, commit violent mob killings, but the film never condemns it at all. There's zero repercussions or thought about any of the violence in the film, and the overall glorification of the mob directly glorifies the violence itself."

He also has a decent smg and the option between a nitro and impacts, which gives him flexibility. He works well as both an anchor and a roamer, and he's pretty much always somewhat useful. Decent operator overall. The only way I'd buff him is make it so that he can place his traps down slightly faster, as he takes one of the longest set ups in the game in my opinion."
