GirlGamers,fedk4bd,t1_fedikvg,1579013535.0,That's pretty fucking metal. Idk why I felt the need to comment this but yea I just like your name and hair you seem pretty cool.
BPD,fedjc1k,t1_fedj8uq,1579012984.0,Yes I like your interpretation; good points and much brighter than my phrasing.
BPD,fedhqvt,t1_fed63ed,1579011836.0,"I understand completely, paranoid thoughts are something I struggle with a lot. I hope maybe you can sort it out though; idk what they did that made you feel that you couldn't be friends with them but I wish you to be able to make lots of friends; and maybe with the person you once liked, if they didn't hurt you too much. I wish you luck! <3"
BPD,fedheb1,t1_fed9mpg,1579011575.0,"Too true, but being alone isn't always as lovely as we think it will be. It's funny Idk about you guys but I always wish to be alone until it happens and then it's the last thing I want. I guess that's where the push pull dynamic of our relationships comes from."
BPD,fedhbba,t1_fed8upj,1579011514.0,"It is easier, but it's a lovely and worthwhile feeling to be accepted for who you are; BPD or not. You deserve that."

BPD,f7chnan,t3_duv9kx,1573592453.0,"DAE feel as if they split on themselves? Like for example if my FP and are doing well I can sometimes have moments of arrogance in between the crippling insecurity; where I think im hot shit and I wonder how my FP could ever leave me. And then doubt creeps in, or we have a heated argument and then I fucking loathe myself so bad and get this intense urge to hurt myself because I think Im an abusive POS"

relationships,f5782m2,t1_f56o68t,1572032644.0,"With all due respect, I just want to put in another perspective. Some of us, think about this in the opposite way. Like for me at least I feel like friends are the ones that come and go, and that my SO is my best friend in the world; the person I can actually trust. Also apologies, not to be rude; but I dont think that is what they are saying that they are being forced to do it. Its more of the fact that it personally makes them feel uncomfortable, so out of worry/courtesy they ensure that they do not do it to their SO. Though you have a point that maybe it hurts this persons friends. Idk, maybe you are just a more selfless person than me."
BPD,f4vdaql,t1_f4ufvwg,1571840648.0,"Exactly it. And then, idk if its just me, but I also get that feeling of shame, that Im a horribly bad person for not responding. I pretty much constantly feel that I am a boring or awful person. Sometimes I feel like I am too boring to live, and even if those thoughts werent in my head constantly, well I basically have nothing to say anyways. All that shit makes me just want to hide, and be by myself. It doesnt solve anything though."

BPD,f0za7wt,t3_d79ff6,1569090308.0,"Yes, I can relate to this so hard. I lost my bestfriend of almost 5 years doing this, as well as frequently canceling our plans. For me, I always hate leaving the house, or answering texts. Anything that brings me back to my reality, or makes me anxious. Plus im kind of addicted to video games, and weed; because my main coping mechanism is avoidance/escapism. Basically, I spend a lot of time trying not to feel my feelings. The people I care about produce such strong emotional reactions from me, and I read so much into every interaction that I find it too exhausting having too many friends. I also have pretty bad social anxiety, which stems from worrying that im deeply evil or flawed, or not a 'real' human being. That im empty, boring, and have nothing to say, that is worth saying; but somehow have fooled everyone into liking me. That is until they realize how awful I am, and abandon me. It comes back in every social situation but is so much worse if Ive known them for awhile, or havent done much of anything new lately. So yea Idk what to say but im sorry if you deal with this too"
BPD,ezth7pc,t3_d27exa,1568130254.0,"Sometimes I do wish for that, but not because it would be any easier to handle, just because its visible suffering that people will never question. I question the validity of my abuse, and my disorder pretty much constantly, and Im very afraid of judgement. People dont tend to understand, or have much sympathy for us bpd so I havent told anyone but my boyfriend.

Primarily I find myself wishing I could touch people and transfer feelings between one another. Like when my boyfriend says Im acting a bit dramatic, because he feels Im upset over something trivial, but for me it feels like Ive been betrayed. *touch* how about you feel like this for hours on end because one stupid thing happened; and it feels like there's no end in sight, and then tell me who's being dramatic now?"
BPD,ezn375b,t3_d1ksgh,1568000296.0,"Hey, I have no idea if it's related to bpd, but I know I get this really bad. To the point that, my best friend of 4 years pretty much 'broke up' with me. It was also related to my incredibly rude, and bad habit of cancelling plans last minute because I was anxious, or having crying spells; and my main coping mechanism is avoidance/spacing out. I also weirdly didnt feel emotionally safe with my friend, but not on them as I often don't feel safe with anyone who makes any criticisms about me. Over the years Ive come to get anxious whenever I leave the house, or whenever I get a text from anyone, because I feel so empty and worthless; and I never know what to say to anyone. So I don't feel worthy in a way of being around others, because I feel like Im just a blank wall. Mentally Im not really coping with life very well, I spend a lot of time ignoring my feelings, and playing video games. Plus Im 20 and I dont have a job, and havent finished highschool yet, so that adds to me having nothing to say. So yea idk if you relate to any of this; but it could be a bit of an apathy type thing, or peraps you're just exhausted from dealing with all the bullshit in your head, so you have no energy left for others? Anyways, I dont have much helpful advice but Im sorry that you deal with this too, also I apologize for rambling so much on your post."

SuicideWatch,eyjn5rn,t1_eyjani3,1567123034.0,"I used to hate rap and would only listen to hard rock because I felt the same, but honestly there are so many great rap songs that speak to me. Im sure they would for you, please check some of them out sometime. Of course you dont have to but I hope you like them if you do! I really like Broken by Lund. Maybe a bit sad but it feels real. I think Cant call it by Spillage Village, and Puzzle by Brother Ali are great as well. Also Immortal Techniques song Dance with the devil kills me everytime, it literally takes my breath away. And finally one last one: I Am by D Lynch, and Hopsin. Id love some music recommendations in return if you want. :)

Overwatch,ex8fb40,t1_ex8esl4,1566072597.0,"Thats true as well, barring stupidity like mine. Still I think there should at least be a full rank reset every few seasons at least. Its kinda depressing that its been 17 seasons and everyones shadow sr is still the same."
Overwatch,ex88zyb,t1_ex88to2,1566070329.0,I mean doesnt change the fact that the ranking system is fucked. Once you go down you stay down is my point. But ok lol
Overwatch,ex7ovy3,t1_ex6z9fq,1566062992.0,"Im fucking bronze now. I was so close to plat for so long. I queued with my silver friend before this role queue shit, lost a shit ton of games, and then angrily didnt play ranked for like 3 seasons. Of course the shadow mmr carries over so I place silver 1500 in role queue. But now, every fucking game the dps sucks assholes and if its not them then the tanks a suicidal dipshit. (not that I or the other healer is perfect obviously but frankly, its bloody ridiculous)
I used to main mercy, and now I play strictly moira/lucio. Or whats needed. Again, nice to not have to rely entirely on idiots. 
One game, I seriously had a hanzo, no prestige yet so pretty new to the game; just sit under the bridge after the first point cap on hollywood, just shooting down the little corridor for 5mins straight, while reind and I pushed the cart. I healed him for like 30 secs before I realized he wasnt moving. When he died he spammed that he needed healing, and group up with him. The person thought everyone else was wrong, yet he was never ever behind a shield, close to point, or near me. Im so bloody tired of it. Im a dps main now. Commence roll queue. Bet Ill get fucking gold on dps, even though I've played maybe 10hrs dps total compared to my almost 200hrs of various supports.

Tldr: Mad cuz bad, but also ranking is a bit janky"

ForeverAlone,ev6lzbb,t3_ci8j15,1564248429.0,"I shouldn't be here, but I feel I really need to say something. From someone who isnt forever alone, but knows how it feels to believe you are simply 'damaged goods;' as much as you may think us breeders have it easier, thats just not true. See the misfortune is spread out pretty evenly. Some of us have severe mental issues, some of us found one person we loved, and latched onto them for dear life (my situation) and now like me, are afraid for the future where they may be single again one day. Because they dont have experience with people, because especially in a relationship, you can become comfortable, and stagnate. Then like me again, some of us have severe social anxiety, or depression. Or body issues. Or in my case insecurity so crippling that you constantly ruin relationships before the other person can even get a chance to love you. Some of us are lucky to have significant others, and that eases some pain, but still, sex does not cure depression. Im not saying that your pain isnt valid, and Im also not trying to say that any of you are wrong, or depressed. But Im just saying that being with a person will not solve all of your problems. I know thats a saying tossed around a lot, and you can scoff if you want. I would have before I went through it myself. For example I used to be really fat, and I hated myself. I felt so ugly, I believed if I could be thinner I would be beautiful and people would like me, and I would like me. But the thing is, Im 'beautiful, and thin' now, but I still hate myself. I still think im an asshole, I still think Im not good enough, I still feel like I bore everyone, and like anyone else in this entire world could replace me. See my insecurity didnt really leave, it just switched focuses. So even if thats the root of the issue, like not being accepted by the opposite sex makes you feel bad about yourself, reinforces that your unlovable, makes you less likely to even try next time; even if thats the problem, having sex wont fix it. Building good experiences with the opposite sex is the only way to fix it. And to do that you have to be appealing to others. Make friendships with people you like not just women you find attractive. Because the problem is not that you are damaged, but that you have no self-esteem, and anxiety and sensitivity about rejection. And that is common even in people who have had sex before. Now before you laugh me off for complaining about my measely breeder problems, I just wanted to say, im trying to explain that I can understand how you feel, I may have been lucky to have been physical, I may be lucky right now to be with someone I love. But that doesnt make me less damaged. That doesnt change the fact that Im so broken I barely leave the house, that I dont have a job. That im so dysfunctional, and still live with my parents. And sometimes its worse having to deal with your feelings, while constantly trying to look out for someone elses. Im sorry though honestly, it breaks my heart reading these posts. Because before I hit puberty I couldn't get a glance from the opposite sex. I was certain no one in this world could ever be capable of loving me. And you know what? I was wrong. So, Im very deeply sorry to hear that anyone else feels this way. I know how truly liberating it can be to really show yourself to another person, how wonderful it can be to tell someone your worst fears, or the bad things you've done without being afraid of them judging you or leaving. But I also know how much work it can be to try to love someone else when you yourself can barely function. So please for your sakes, try not to obssess about your virginity, or the fact that you're not good with the opposite sex. You're only reinforcing your feelings of helpessness. And unfortunately for us, a good majority of people out there can smell baggage and issues a mile away.. Same with desperation. The more you want it the harder it is to get it ya know?"

AskReddit,epnnxns,t3_bv51tj,1559330439.0,"Two memories one of my father, and one my boyfriend:
The tears in my fathers eyes when he saw the cuts running up, and down my arms at my lowest point, I'll remember that until I die. Also, the helplessness I felt when my boyfriend was going through the same. The ache of knowing how they feel, but you cant do anything to stop the pain they're feeling. You can't be there every second for them if they need you, and you fear that if you leave them alone it'll be the last time you ever see them. My boyfriend and I are both doing much better now, with depression and haven't cut in years thankfully, but whenever im feeling low I remember all of this, I remember the pain I would be causing to the people I love for just one moment of relief."
