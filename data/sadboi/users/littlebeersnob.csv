crows,fqhmwsv,t3_gim8ch,1589380253.0,This just happened to me too! We recently got chickens and let them free range thev back yard most of the day (keeping an eye on the yard and sky). I feed the crows in the front yard. A hawk was flying nearby and a crow was chasing behind nipping at it. I was happy to think the chickens are a little safer because of my crow buddies.

BackYardChickens,foj7wzf,t3_g7kql2,1587811912.0,"We are chicken twins. Your flock looks EXACTLY like mine, and we have the same coop. I was slightly alarmed for a minute wondering why someone else would claim my chickens as their own and how you got my picture. Happy chickening!"

Anxiety,epgj3ls,t3_buklwx,1559214192.0,"It creates a dilemma for me mentally. I am thankful my husband doesn't face the same struggles I do. I would never wish that kind of hell on anyone. But because he's never faced it, he doesn't understand it at all. And empathy isn't really his strongest suit, which I think is true for a lot of people who judge us or think it should be easy to pull ourselves out. 

We're flailing around, trying desperately to keep our heads above water, getting exhausted and often worrying that we're going to drown. But the people sitting on the beach can't see our struggle. 

But I understand that you can't really comprehend the terror and pure exhaustion of drowning when you're on dry land and sitting next to the life preserver."
