I’m not supper into it, but as far as I know, Disney releases new classic dolls every May/June. Sometimes there’s just little changes like some accessory, the box or even nothing for one particular doll, but the norm here is that all the princesses have some alteration one year to another.

This is a very shitty thing to process. For her, the person who she trusted more took advantage of her innocence and now all of your relationship comes as a lie to her, because all of the things you’ve done weren’t out of love but out of guilt.

That being said, you actually seem regretful and I do think you deserve forgiveness. It’s not alright blackmailing you, and money will never repair the damage you did to her. She’s probably doing all of this out of spite, and I get it. Give her time and space to process her emotions.

I’ve improved a lot on this step by step and I want to pass what I’ve learn onto her. One of the things that helped me was make up, because I was forced to look myself in the mirror until it became normal.

I’m aware that I don’t have the same body issues as her. But she despises herself and that’s no good. She needs to improve her image so her parents don’t give her such a hard time about it and so she can find a job, but most importantly because she needs to accept her body as it is.

About her finding a source of meaning outside her body, I agree. She is an interesting girl and needs to run away from her house as soon as possible, but that’s not possible until she finds a job.

DeadBedroomsMD,ex3m1yq,t1_ewye6tx,1565987727.0,"Hi! Thank’s for your response ❤️

-Is it possible that he really is understanding of the problem and is trying to simply respectfully wait out the med increase? If you are spinning all these plates to try and improve things, how is he reacting? You mentioned him being embarrassed, but still initiating, so I think it's possible he might just totally get that this is a temporary problem and he's trying to practice patience?

He IS understanding, but at any rate I cannot lower my meds until maybe a year from now? Two? And even then I’ll have low libido ‘cause it’s very plausible that I couldn’t live without meds.

About him being embarrased, it’s just in the context of talking about sex or how to improve the situation, not about iniciating at all.

I also think he doesn’t want to make me feel guilty (which I feel). 

He’s a really awesome guy and understands that is not my fault and that I don’t owe him anything. He doesn’t complain and just masturbates if I don’t want to do it. But nonetheless I feel shitty. I miss the intimacy and having fun, and I know he misses it too but just won’t say it.

-When he initiates and you decline (which is really understandable!), how does he react?

He insist a bit more and leaves me alone. I think he’s used to this.

Let me explain myself a bit more, because due to my BDP sometimes it’s very complicated and I have ambivalent feelings all the time.

On one hand, I miss the intimacy and the fun, but I don’t want to do it because I don’t get excited so I get bored soon.

On the other hand, I feel I can’t be affectionate. If I start kissing and hugging him, he’ll want more and it’ll be like teasing him for nothing. He misses this too, and complains about me not being loving enough, even though I try to express it through non-physical ways (like making something tasty or doing something for him). Hi reproaches me not touching him, but how could I? Every time I kiss or caress him out of love, he wants more and I end up rejecting him and feeling guilty.

I really want to increase my libido, that’s just it. I want to be like I was before I was chemically castrated. I get angry at him for wanting to have sex, and at me for not wanting to have it."
DeadBedrooms,ewyravs,t1_ewy7ifp,1565885645.0,"You said he looks away at sex scenes in TV. Ok, that’s weird. I have a LL right now, and I’ve met asexual people, but neither of us are uncomfortable with talking about sex or watching it on TV. Could it be that there’s something actually wrong with your husband? Maybe he was abused, or had some terrible experiences with sex. Maybe it has something to do with his childhood or his parents.

My advice is that you sit with him and talk long and deep. Explain how you feel and the need to understand what’s happening, or even going to a counselour.   He may not want to talk about it, but you have to insist or your marriage will end up in a divorce."

Keep going, whatever the cost. Just keep going and you know it will pass at some point. I’m 27 too, and I cannot believe I’m alive, I thought I would be dead by 25. But I am and in the last year things have changed a lot for me, and for the best. You never know what’s gonna happen. Keep going head on and try to improve yourself and your life, step by step.

But please keep going. Please."
