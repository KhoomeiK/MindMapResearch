SuicideWatch,f9g06kg,t3_e4vvro,1575290182.0,You being a person who feels this way about life. Is there anything anyone can say that makes you feel supported or cared for. My guy has the same issue with his parents and I wish I could help but I have no power at all. I have spoken to them about it but they brushed it off all the same. Do I continue to just repeat the I support you and love you line when it doesn't change anything about how he feels?
