bipolar,fk3tpg3,t1_fk2wf18,1583846003.0,I’m pretty lucky I’ve got a pretty active job(construction) so no it wasn’t a huge deal but I also only stayed on it for a few months so I can see why it would be
bipolar,fk2vae8,t1_fk2ofb7,1583810021.0,Lol when I was on vraylar I used to eat spoonfuls of honey. So basically yeah that was my experience.
bipolar,fk2v61c,t1_fk29u7s,1583809936.0,You can take both at the same time. They actually have a synergy. It definitely seems like you need some more stabilization.
BipolarReddit,fjyahb8,t1_fjy7gxq,1583692939.0,This was my first winter in the Seattle area. No bueno for bipolar disorder
StopSpeeding,fgrl6eq,t1_fgr0s45,1581049675.0,"Hey for real I’m thirteen months off of meth and for real I have very very few cravings at this point. I honestly feel really great. Money in the bank, gas in the tank, go to the gym everyday. It’s seriously worth it."
StopSpeeding,fgjwkbb,t1_fgjkc9n,1580852785.0,"Lol the funny thing is that’s still almost half that have used it in the past month, which even if only half of those people are addicted that’s still a 25% chance you’ll turn into a junkie which isn’t worth it."
bipolar,f1byfds,t1_f19605e,1569345788.0,I’m not taking it but I have heard that it helps people stay abstinent from meth so that’s pretty interesting.
bipolar,f11zjmm,t3_d7lcue,1569132735.0,Yes i am actually really glad you said this.  Whenever my lamictal dose changes (goes up) I feel really irritable and honestly a little worse.  Takes me a few weeks or at least a couple to adjust. Even my mom noticed it in me.
Nootropics,f0qh8b7,t1_f0q8x0r,1568859817.0,Not very well though
StopSpeeding,f02dgs8,t3_d3fd55,1568328329.0,Help him if you can but try not to get to attached to his sobriety. It can be very taxing and it is not fun to play mom
StopSpeeding,ezh0utv,t1_ezfq3p3,1567904064.0,"Exactly, life at this point nine months sober is actually quite enjoyable. Contentment is better than being high."
StopSpeeding,eyy1ugx,t1_eyxzndb,1567568689.0,I’ll still check em out even if you aren’t totally committed to the 100% thing. It would be very hard to be sober without them
bipolar,eyxa4qx,t1_eyx9dza,1567548291.0,Yeah but I’ve done the same shit. Start truly believing I’m not bipolar only for it to sneak up and remind me I am
bipolar,eyvdscx,t1_eyvdkzq,1567489863.0,"Oh joy, are you glad you got off of it?"

bipolar,ex2ce06,t1_ex291s0,1565966839.0,"I got this done and honestly it helped a ton, side effect free pretty much. That’s the main benefit, it shows if your body will digest meds properly without (or minimal) side effect causing metabolites.  I think it’s the start of much more effective medication prescribing"
OutOfTheLoop,ew0emff,t1_evyrfza,1564985612.0,"That’s funny because I am a recovering meth addict and someone did put some in my hand the other day, and because my life has become so rich and I know what would happen if I did it, I honestly had no desire to do it."

researchchemicals,eu3hygj,t1_eu3b984,1563415164.0,"Yeah I quit meth a year ago and you definitely do feel like shit for a hot minute, but life is a lot more enjoyable now. That’s really no way to live"
AskDrugNerds,erwpsac,t1_erw8hvw,1561351523.0,Yeah especially when it is super clear and comes in big shards

bipolar,eprlua0,t1_eprdwwx,1559426921.0,Lol I kinda wanna go back on it but I had a problem with meth so I think I may wanna stay away from the dopamine
bipolar,eprd5l1,t1_eprd1up,1559422507.0,As a male I could literally cum and keep fucking and orgasm like two more times
