toastme,fbca1zp,t1_fbbfaik,1576719198.0,"Ahhh well then you should probably set an appointment. I think you look good at least you look fine. Lol for me I just preoccupy my time with distractions.  Smoking bud helps a lot for me. Those pills i got from the doctors made me feel like shit. But im getting close to accepting what i am. Trust me, its worse when you get told you are ugly and reality sinks in. For you it's just your mind being conditioned to think negatively. But for me it's like i look in the mirror and its not in my head."
