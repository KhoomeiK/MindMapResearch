It looks like your rights will not be too affected in the long-term.  The key part is that you reserve the right to terminate the agreement by written notification.  Basically if you write to Sheepy and tell him you want him to take your song down and to end the agreement, the agreement should end in 7 days, and whatever rights you gave up you will get back.  

While the agreement is in effect, Sheep will have lots of rights, but they won't necessary limit *your* rights, because the assignment of rights is ""non-exclusive.""   Nothing in the agreement will prevent you from signing a record deal later on, for example, or from publishing the song separately on your own channel \*BUT\* just about every record label will insist that you end your deal with Sheep before signing with them.  

You could sign this agreement and continue to promote your track all you want.  You could market it and make money off it, too.  But if anyone insists on *exclusive* publication or reproduction (copy) rights, then you'll have to end the agreement with Sheep."

The idea of the elective moral conscience leads to a perception of choice and an obsession over making the “best,” the “noblest,” the “true” and “right” moral action.  But someone who has plumbed the depths of nihilism sees these perceptions as mere surface rationalizations of much deeper instincts and drives, unknown and unknowable.  Whatever level of generality you speak of those forces in (e.g. as laws of physics vs biochemistry vs psychology), they are ultimately determinative of the “choice” we make, the moral “action” we take.  So physical determinism and moral nihilism go hand in hand. 

But that’s no fun, because we still hunger for greatness and beauty and the triumph of the will.  We can’t unironically pursue absolute truth anymore without subjecting ourselves to the same criticisms levied at Kant’s categorical imperatives.  The only alternative seems to be to go “down,” to go “in” to the determined self, to befriend those unknowable forces that define us, to look for them with a courageous intellectual conscience, unafraid of ugliness or evil or suffering, in order to “become who we are.”

“Becoming who we are” is meant to sound paradoxical — you are not changing from what you always were all along; the same forces that shaped you then shape you now, only your conscience has stopped fighting them.  

There’s no room for “choice” in becoming what one IS (otherwise it would be “become what one WILL”).  And that to me is the meaning of amor fati: to love one’s fate, one must first recognize that he is a fateful being."

nosurf,fiyucmv,t3_faf87p,1582847144.0,"I find nothing foreboding in this.  Curiosity is for humans, no less than this AI, the drive to encounter the novel, the surprising, the dangerous, in order to enrich our knowledge of how the “game” of life is played.

To me, the danger lies in placing too much emphasis on the importance of televised (re: simulated and representative) phenomena and too little on the gold mine of novelties and problems that inhabit our lived experience.  

Instead of television, substitute the infinitude of written works — be they books or Reddit posts — and the point remains the same.  The curious animal/human/robot consults that which is external to itself in order to learn how to operate within its world.  As long as that consultation is fruitful and germane to living, there is no threat.  

I sympathize, however, with the paralysis of the AI.  Faced with an abundance of external information and stimuli, it cannot act until it has viewed, categorized, and understood ALL of the relevant data — after all, why play a game you are still learning about?  Likewise,  I am at a juncture in life where the manifold future possibilities (in career, hobby, relationship, lifestyle) compete with one another in my mind to answer the question: What is the “right” or “best” or “meta” way to play the game of my life? 

Unlike the AI, I cannot depend on iterative processes to try millions of answers gradually converging on the best response.  I can at best approximate the iterative learning process through a study of personal and world history. 

...

Perhaps I had better consider life as a dance floor: sometimes I am one with the frenzy of the rhythmic whirl of bodies, positively giddy and dizzy with motion, simultaneously elated and exhausted; sometimes I must do nothing but look on, rest, gather my energy, wait for my song, and look on at the dancing of others.  This “looking on” the dance of life as an outsider — is it any different from watching TV?  And yet who hasn’t enjoyed watching, cheering on, critiquing, or learning from the other dancers?

For that matter, would it not be ironic to lament an AI that searches for novelty and surprise on a platform that caters to precisely that same instinct in us?  Or are we here for something other than curiosity?"

Basically he gave them control over his web-browsing, and found a program that would email them each week with reports of any “problem” sites.  It’s done wonders for him as a friend/husband/father, and he radiates humility and charity every time he talks about it. 

Sometimes you have to let others in to see “the ugly.”  In your case, talking to others proactively about aspects of your health for which you want to be held accountable will itself prove to them that you are a sane, self-aware individual.  Giving them license to call you out and check in on you will prevent them from feeling patronizing or paranoid for caring about your well-being. 

I had a similar experience with weed-associated psychosis.  Basically I grew hyper-skeptical of what everyone thought about be.  I was extremely paranoid and cautious, and isolated myself from everyone.  

But isolated thoughts and feelings practically breed paranoia, since they allow out mind to believe whatever it wants without a reality check.  

For my part, it has helped to be very slow and cautious in what I say and think, and why.  To this day I am constantly discovering residual suspicions and presumptions against people and the world that I have no reason to believe are actually true (for example, jumping to explain myself in self-defense when the person I’m talking to has given no indication that they misunderstood, judged, or criticized what I was saying).

Airing these otherwise-private thoughts and feelings with others prevents then from festering into full-blown conspiracies.  Basically there are three possibilities when you do so: 

1) you discover that your initial presumption about what someone is thinking or doing was wrong, and now your mind is set at ease;

2) you discover that you were right (say, that someone admits to gossip-tweeting about you), but now you have firsthand evidence so you can let yourself and others know your belief is justified; or
