ihavesex,eymm5jy,t3_cxiyaq,1567213113.0,"Yooo, I ain't even gonna lie. When someone announces they're having a baby, my first thought isn't, ""AWW CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR LITTLE BLESSING!!!"" It's usually, ""...you got creamed."" I'm not even the type of person who discuses sex a lot, it just pops into my head!"
sadcringe,ey66nck,t3_cvmtsu,1566848624.0,"Oh my goodness I hate that lol that's why I usually tell guys not to flirt with me if we've gotten to know each other first, it just puts ideas into my head. Then I end up sad because I basically created a relationship in my head and heart that was never going to be one in the first place...

Very awkward."
depression,exdlnm2,t3_cs27u9,1566179983.0,"Instead of making me feel better, comments like that would actually make me feel guilty. Like I wasn't allowed to complain or speak out on what I was going through. It's not fair to make people feel that way.

Everyone in life struggles, yes. But that does not mean that everyone's personal struggles don't matter as much or they're not as huge of a deal.

For instance, a teenager being broken up with by their first crush can be just as painful to them as someone losing their spouse of many years to cancer. Many people would probably say that nope, losing the spouse is definitely worse but what they fail to realize is that both people are hurting tremendously. It's still valid, no matter how other's view it.

Obviously, perception and opinion may change over time. That teenager may grow up one day and go through a painful divorce and realize that instead of the heartbreak at 16 being the worst point of their life, this is now it.

Yes, there will always be someone who seemingly has it worse based on different views of the situation.. but all pain, struggles, sadness, health issues, etc are still there. The person is still dealing with it and it's still effecting them."
AskMen,ex93gmw,t3_crnn29,1566082932.0,"This is obviously a preference thing but...

The degrading dirty talk. Calling her a b*tch, sl*t, wh*re, etc. This could also cover male and other genders. It may look hot when you're horny and trying to just get a quick one off but..

Some people don't like that, it makes them feel dirty instead of feeling pleasurable. It could also depend on the type of sex you're having. Romantic sex and crazy jack-hammering badger sex are two different moods.

This (and many / all other reasons listed on this thread) is why communication is key to any relationship or sex connection. Both (or all) person's involved should be enjoying it."
AskReddit,ex6kzqg,t3_crh848,1566047386.0,"My sister. Her speciality? Getting in relationships with much older men, causing hell within the relationship, then finding a way to make the other person look solely responsible for everything wrong that happened.

I've always suspected she's done it for attention. She always leaves with a sob story of some kind. She's had many, many relationships and nearly all of them have ended the same way.

Obvioisly, her personal life is her business.. except she makes it other people's business by putting her ex's on blast. ""He did THIS."" ""He said THAT."" Never what she does. Nearly all of them have called her crazy.

I love my sister but damn.. I honestly get tired of hearing about it lol no matter what though, all her immediate family does."
dating_advice,ew5tjan,t3_cmtlay,1565144726.0,"It hurts being one option of many. It's not fun. People don't seem to realize that hey...this is real. Life is real. You might not be the one hurting but I can guarantee if you've got one out of those 5 who cares about you and they find out...they'll be hurting. It's not fair at all, especially when you're making them each feel like they're oh so special and the only one. Anyone who does that is a piece of shit, imo. Get to know them but do NOT LEAD THEM ON!!! Leaves us wondering why we weren't good enough when you suddenly bail to option #6.

And don't use the excuse of you being hurt in the past to justify hurting someone else. Grow up. EVERYONE has been hurt before by something or someone. Stop punishing other people for something someone else did. That's the lowest thing a person can do and frankly, I think it makes you a coward to put someone else whose innocent in that same situation."
dating_advice,evvw824,t3_cldq67,1564848950.0,"I feel the exact same way. Like I get how when you're horny...you're horny, but sex is just so much more to me than banging genitalia together to get off. Many people think they can handle a casual experience then end up hurt or disappointed in it because they come to the conclusion that in the end, it was meaningless and it leaves them emotionally unfulfilled. I'd honestly rather die a virgin than to just do it with anybody, even when I'm super horny.

&#x200B;

Not to say it's wrong for people who are adjusted to it. It's just not the lifestyle for me personally."
dating_advice,evs5y4a,t3_ckpc0s,1564731468.0,"As a girl, I personally would like to know someone's intentions first but I also do like starting out as friends. Its nice to be with some one you can trust with things that aren't just skin, ya know? With a true friend, you can pretty much be there for everything from the get go and add the more personal stuff once you work up to an intimate relationship.

However, if someone likes me and they'd like to persue something more at some point, I would love to know up front. People sometimes forget you can date or marry your best friend. There doesn't need to be different people to fill different roles in your life. I just feel a relationship built on friendship first is one that'll last better for me because even if it doesn't work out romantically, if you're true friends from the start, you can still have that person be a part of your life."
depression,evn70oj,t3_ck913s,1564619789.0,"I've came pretty low lately. I've had thoughts for years about it but never actually acted. I googled ""symptoms of ibuprofen overdose"" about a week or two ago because I didn't want to possibly tip anyone off. I wanted to go into my bathroom, take the bottle of pills, and swallow all that were left. Thankfully, I read that most people who try don't actually die from it. I've also had more twisted thoughts lately and it's started to scare me but I still don't think I'm at the point where I would actually act on it.

No one knows. I don't feel comfortable talking to my family because growing up, whenever I would try to express my emotions I always felt like they got swept under the rug. Everyone else's pain seemed to matter more. My emotional well being was ignored. I'm 22 now and really want to seek therapy / psychiatric help.. I'm scared to. I don't even know how to get a thing like that started. I'm so use to being closed off that I don't know how to let anyone in when they do try. I know if I go into full depth of my thoughts and feelings, I'll probably be sent away. I'd definitely get medicine which doesn't bother me, just worries me about the side effects of increased suicidal tendencies.

Just trying to cope on my own the best way I can, the same as it's been this past decade of my life. It's gotten easier in some regards, harder in others, and stagnant in most. I go to bed and pray that ""tomorrow will be a good day"" because I try so hard to look at the good that's still here, even when I don't feel like I have anything worth fighting for anymore.

** Just wanted to add, I'm not looking for sympathy. I just wanted to get this out. I don't want advice and I don't want pity. I know, I need help. I'm getting closer to seeking it, I just need a little more time I guess. I'm sorry to all of you going through this as well. ðŸ’” **"
depression,eve4dhg,t3_cjkd6q,1564455230.0,"I go through spells of being happy for short bursts (few days to maybe a couple of weeks at a time) then back to depression for either a few days or even weeks again. This past winter, I was in a depressed spell for 3 weeks straight and all I did was cry. Heavy cries until I literally had nothing left.

When I'm not sad.. I actually get scared. I always wonder, ""when's it gonna hit? How's it gonna feel again? Really heavy or just a light tap?"" Things seem to always go wrong when I try looking up at the good so I'm a litterally terrified of being happy... it's scary to actually admit that."
