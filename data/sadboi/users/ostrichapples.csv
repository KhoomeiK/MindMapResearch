CPTSD,fpj37yi,t3_gdija6,1588655334.0,"As a kid over at my friends house I broke a glass vase and immediately began sweeping it up and crying because I was so scared about the reaction to come...when my friends mom came in and was like"" omg no stop touching that its glass! I'll clean it up!!"" And consoled me. I was truly shocked. And then I began to realize how toxic my mother was compared to others."
depression,fonk8j9,t3_g8h05l,1587921084.0,I'm with you. But it's not worth it. You know deep down it wont be worth it. It's a dangerous trap your mind is leading you towards and a very dark road that you know wont end well. You're worth do much  more and dont need fo go down there again
relationship_advice,foeluuw,t3_g72sjw,1587707296.0,If you're not ready going to a counselor wont help. You have to be open and willing to do the work. That being said I most definitely agree with him that you should. I think almost everybody could benefit from counseling whether you've had traumas or not. It never hurts to work on yourself and improve yourself. Is there any way you could tell him you'll think about it but you're just not ready right now? Is there any way you could consider it in the future?
Anxiety,fo1sdjd,t3_g4rlji,1587440392.0,"I do this when I go over everything thing I've said to people in a day or the last while. I'm actually experiencing this now because it's the end of the day for me and I'm in panic mode about everything and anything I've said to people, how I've responded, how I've spoken, every little detail about interactions with others and it makes me feel like I've potentially said or done something wrong when I probably havent, so for no reason."
Anxiety,fny80ko,t3_g4hgcb,1587355696.0,"I get alot of weird intrusive random thoughts. Some of them cause me to physically wince and scrunch my face up or bury my hands in my face or to clench my fists. Most recently I went to the bathroom at work after someone had just come out and the toilet seat was warm so all I could envision was said person naked butt, knowing my butt was now on the same toilet seat there's was. Fucking weird man I know but it caused me to physically cringe and wince until I could finally think happier thoughts lmao. I guess this is somewhat normal for me though and always just thought it was only me.. weird I havemt really told anybody that before lmao eww ahhhh"
offmychest,fnxwlig,t3_g4edxc,1587347902.0,Big dog or little dog? Either way I've seen dogs consume very unhealthy amounts of chocolate before and been absolutely fine. Best of luck lots of water and hopefully your dog will be fine
offmychest,fnxwfka,t3_g4f00h,1587347803.0,"Alot of time eating disorders manifest as a way to control something. To have control over something in your life. Either way, itd be best to speak with a professional about this. You can start by seeing your family doctor or school counselor. I've been through hell and back with eating disorders but recovery is very much possible and you can learn to love yourself and live with yourself and be okay with yourself. Making yourself throw up will come with many severe consequences you can and will do alot of damage to your body some being irreversible so get help as soon as you can. You deserve treatment help and to be loved â™¡"
offmychest,fnxv9ev,t3_g4hvcf,1587347074.0,I'm so sorry you've been through so much. Your dad sounds like a dick. You're feelings are 10000% valid. You're an amazingly strong and resilient person to still be here today after all that and I hope you continue to blossom and grow as you have been. You're very worthy of living and I'm sorry your dad makes you feel like crap about everything

relationship_advice,fnwdkv3,t3_g4b42p,1587316344.0,Uhm wtf is wrong with your bf. Not cool to belittle you over something so small. So is he not allowed to masterbate either then? Is it the toy aspect? What's so wrong about toys? He sounds childish and/or controlling
DoesAnybodyElse,fnwcu3d,t3_g3s5a0,1587315935.0,I used to pull them out of the eggs before cooking them because they grossed me out so much. They still kinda do but I've gotten over it.
DoesAnybodyElse,fnwce9p,t3_g42mu5,1587315691.0,I have immense social anxiety and that's a big yes from me. I cant reply to group chat messages. I just lurk and feel stupid for never contributing. The same goes for posting things on social media like personal things. I have an immense fear of doing so and being judged. Whether it be a facebook post or a snapchat story I feel paralyzed by the thought of doing so and everyone seeing it. It's weird because as a teen It didnt seem to bother me nearly as much. Now in my 20s I feel paralyzed by that fear of being judged online.

NoStupidQuestions,fnuwdvo,t1_fnuw53a,1587272889.0,That's okay! When I was a virgin I was scared to even use tampons because I was so uncomfortable with everything down there. Just takes some getting used to
sex,fnuw9d5,t3_g3jgtu,1587272791.0,I've (f) found that riding him while hes laying down to be the easiest (ok not easy at all really but easier) way to achieve this. Also oddly enough I've also found pubic hair to help with achieving an orgasm while on top. Theres a certain way I can thrust and move that can make me finish like that just takes figuring it out to know it. Him also having a bit of a belly kinda helps more too cause my clit can rub against that while piv.
NoStupidQuestions,fnut6m5,t1_fnusayd,1587270430.0,"Youd honestly be surprised how far the cup can go in and still be easily retrievable so just try to relax, I totally understand its nerve racking. You'll become alot more comfortable with your own v after all this ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"
NoStupidQuestions,fnus8yb,t1_fnupvz3,1587269737.0,Yeah it sounds like it's not in far enough! I only ever have to reinsert after going to the bathroom if it was a poop I really had to strain on ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ otherwise peeing is a breeze with the cup in now!
confessions,fnured9,t3_g410os,1587269123.0,"Wow I feel this on a deep level. I have a horrible work ethic if I dont have anyone to impress. Although I am terrified of losing my job( even though i know I wont because I'm a very valuable worker and can recognize that) if I'm working on stuff for myself I dont see a point to it because I'm so concerned with how others view me and perceive me. 
No advice really cause I'm lost on this but know you're not alone."
confessions,fnuqk9w,t3_g3y9q8,1587268525.0,Ouch. I'm petty af and would go on strike and do nothing for my partner if I'm not getting anything in return in some sort of form like even effort is something and shes not putting any effort into you. Yall need to sit down and talk about this unfortunately I know that seems scary and it could bring up tension between you too but I dont think it can be solved any other way than sitting down like adults and discussing things hopefully calmly. Try and organize your thoughts to be able to bring it all up calmly. Best of luck
NoStupidQuestions,fnupmus,t1_fnuotoc,1587267861.0,Like the cup being in? No I dont think so. Sometimes if the suction isnt right I get a weird pressure in the vag from the cup and I just reinsert it and it usually feels better
NoStupidQuestions,fnuosdf,t1_fnunda2,1587267262.0,Yo same. I honestly wouldn't drink water on my period cause I was so sick of having to change it every fucking time I had to pee and i drink a lot of water lmao. Been using a cup for 4 years now and I couldnt imagine ever going back. You'll get the hang of it eventually!
confessions,fnunqha,t1_fnun9e9,1587266514.0,Wow thanks man. I wasnt expecting to receive any reply to this anyways. I think that's where I struggle most being my true authentic self. I dont quite know what that really is anymore since I'm so conforming to others and try to make others happy am so concerned with how others view me that I get so lost  in others that I've lost myself and am afraid to express myself for fear of judgement. I guess that's where I need to start with things is being my true authentic self instead of putting up this front in Hope's others will like me and approve of me. Thanks for bouncing thoughts back and forth.
NoStupidQuestions,fnun9q3,t1_fnumgdo,1587266188.0,"You're welcome. I prefer having the stem part almost all the way in, so that if I were to wipe down there with toilet paper I dont really feel the cup at all. That's where I've found it most comfortable. Sometimes using a cup is kind of a pain in the ass making sure it's in right, but if it's in good enough it doesnt bother me at all. Honestly I've had the cup go pretty far up in me so I think you'll be more than safe! Goodluck! Just takes some getting used to."
NoStupidQuestions,fnumek5,t1_fnum2v5,1587265583.0,You have to make sure to relax your muscles down there. If you're tense itll feel impossible to get out. I find sitting on the toilet is always easiest to relax everything and kind of 'push' and it opens everything up more. Honestly dude (super tmi)  I've masterbated before with it in and it makes it almost go deeper inside me to where I've had to dig it out. It scared me at first but I realized how far it could go inside me and still be retrievable.  When relaxed I just use my dominant hand and stick it up there until I get a good enough grip on the cup to pull it out. ðŸ¤ª
NoStupidQuestions,fnulgy4,t3_g3z4y0,1587264944.0,Are you inserting it far enough in? I find if I dont put my cup in far enough its awkward and painful. Youd be surprised how far those things can go inside you and still be able to retrieve it ðŸ˜‚
