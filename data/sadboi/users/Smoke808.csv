Went to the hospital 4 different times and bloodwork,ekgs,and x rays came out perfect. Every single time, it just kept pissing me off cause I thought they didn’t believe me. 
Finally went to a cardiologist and she put me on bupropion xl 150 mg and .25 clonazepam. 
It’s been about a month and haven’t had an attack since. If I do it’s very mild and I can calm myself down pretty fast knowing that it’s just an attack and I’m not gonna freakin die. 
Oh and I also quit smoking as well. 
Changing your diet can help too"

I barely started getting them a lil over two weeks ago and they just came out of nowhere 🤦🏾‍♂️. When I first got them I went to two different hospitals four times plus a fire station cause I didn’t know what was going on. I seriously thought I was gonna have a heart attack and die every single time it happened. Bloodwork, ekgs, and Xrays came back perfect. Nothing was wrong. Which made it worse cause I still didn’t know what was going on with me. Finally I went to a cardiologist and she was the one who told me I was having panic/anxiety attacks."

PanicAttack,foe8qhu,t3_g6zn00,1587698333.0,"Nah I don’t blame you for thinking like that. I went 4 times and two different hospitals plus a fire station. I was getting frustrated because they kept releasing me when I thought there was something wrong with my heart but Xrays and bloodwork proved otherwise. If you can set up an appointment with a cardiologist to get peace of mind go for it. I don’t have insurance but the visit was only like 100 bucks. If not just try not to stress about it. Reading about panic/anxiety attacks really helped me as well. So did breathing tricks. 
If you have trouble sleeping at night try looking on amazon for a weighted blanket. It helps at times. Never think the worse because that sky rockets your attack and it’s just a never ending circle"
PanicAttack,foe7oa1,t3_g6zn00,1587697698.0,"Yup. I barely started having them a lil over two weeks ago. I didn’t know what they were at first so I kept rushing to the e.r because I thought I was gonna die or have a heart attack. Bloodwork, ekgs, and Xrays came back perfect. Went to a cardiologist and got prescribed .25 dissolvable clonazapam for anxiety/panic attacks. Been taking it for about a week now and haven’t had one yet. If I do then it’s very minor but yes I did feel pain in my shoulder area and def in my chest. Felt tight and my left arm felt a lil tingly 
Once I started to accept that I was having these attacks it made it a lil easier to cope with"
PanicAttack,fo9ihn4,t3_g6b8yi,1587620477.0,Damn. they just gave me clonazepam dissolving tablets and for some reason also gave me bupropion?

If you want to take the extra step and just get bloodwork done and an X-ray to have peace of mind go ahead and go man. I’m still going through it and it’s still pretty fresh for me but I’m seriously just working on my breathing and it helps out a lot. May not happen right away but after a few minutes it will go down.

My bloodwork came out good, my chest,heart,lungs,and everything else came back perfect. Nothing was wrong with them so they kept telling me it could be anxiety/panick attacks causing these heart  palpitations.
