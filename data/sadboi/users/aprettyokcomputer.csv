pokemon,fq19chn,t1_fq18z5s,1589043489.0,"Lastly - my point is, if they were able to make the snes available at a cheaper price, why not at the very least do the same with the original game boy or even game boy color? the GBA might be a bit too much to ask for, but maybe I‚Äôm wrong"
pokemon,fq18z5s,t1_fq18lq1,1589043381.0,"Like yeah, sure, I bought the virtual console version of Crystal and it‚Äôs fantastic, but I‚Äôd just as well love to be able to play fire red on my 2ds (or even a reissued GBA) as opposed to getting yet another GBA because mine is slowly starting to shit the bed. Maybe I‚Äôm in a really specific niche here?"
pokemon,fq18lq1,t3_ggd6vl,1589043249.0,"I think what Nintendo should maybe consider is a reissue of the GBC/GBA, in the same vein that Sony is doing with the PS1 classic. It‚Äôs a cheaper rendition of the original with all of the classic games pre loaded onto it, that way no one would have to worry about buying lots of extra games or shelling out a bunch for virtual console titles. Hell, Nintendo even did this by reissuing the NES and SNES (the physical systems) with all of the core games on it for a reasonable price. The hardware is so old now, it‚Äôd be really easy and cheap to recreate - or else they wouldn‚Äôt have done that with some of their classic consoles."
