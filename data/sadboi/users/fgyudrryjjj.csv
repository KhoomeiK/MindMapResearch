First, sales are going to be around for a couple of weeks or even longer. EVERY year stores will say ""Huge sale x% off everything"" and then people will feel like they NEED it...then the next day ""We are extending the sale""....So here's the thing, not only can you buy some time to think about what you really want, but also some things might sell out making it so that you CAN'T waste your money!

Another way I think about it is to stop fixating on ""Ooh look at that sale price"" I think ""If this was the price year round would I still buy it?""

From the very beginning, explain that you have never had a physical and that you don't know what to expect. From there, answer questions honestly because that will help your doctor decide what sort of tests should be done.

In terms of the physical side it's ok to ask for an explanation of what they will be doing, how they will do it, and what they are checking or looking for. Women should be prepared for having their breasts examined, men, their prostate. The list goes on.

AskReddit,f4ozkoe,t3_dl9zbx,1571712056.0,"When characters wear their shoes in the house. From outside to inside to back outside they just keep their shoes on...it drives me nuts.

How characters are supposedly financially struggling yet never wear clothes more than once.

Also..how Dawson's Creek was the last time I saw a girl's hair down that still had a crease from wearing a pony tail before. It never bothered me until someone pointed it out and now I can't unsee it!"
beyondthebump,f4k6dl1,t3_dkt3bq,1571637268.0,"I learned ASL a few years ago so I just sign as I speak simply because I can and it's a way of keeping up the practice. My kids NEVER sign back to me aside from a few signs and I just figured I'd done the most I can. Except.....every now and then I'll take a phone call and the kids will talk to me, while listening to the call I sign to my kids to be quiet or answer whatever question they have completely in sign and they UNDERSTAND! I've also caught them moving their hands when they sing the alphabet or basic vocabulary.

Sign is another language. It only helps children to learn multiple languages, they soak it up like a sponge!"
AskReddit,f4k5ydc,t1_f4k41az,1571636762.0,A bunch of blocks that you have to hit a certain amount of times to get them to break by aiming and shooting hundreds of balls at a time. The bricks move down after each shot and if they touch the bottom you have to restart the level. Addictive. The balls bounce around as blocks break and it is very satisfying to clear a bunch in one go.

AskReddit,f4k3v4n,t3_dkt18q,1571634421.0,"I thought the laugh track (or any reaction like 'aw' or clapping) in a TV show was the reaction from other people watching at the same time. I thought that meant other people in their homes could hear me too and I'd try to react in a way to stand out for my voice to be heard by other kids and the actors (because I thought the actors could hear me since they were filmed in front of a live studio audience) . I thought enthusiastically clapping, laughing, and aw-ing would let the actors know just how well they were doing and how much the show was liked. 


I watched a lot of TV as a kid and my brother always made fun of me for the shows I liked.  It made me feel like I had friends somewhere in the world that liked the same things as me so I felt like less if a freak."
AskReddit,f4k31wi,t3_dkt18q,1571633575.0,I thought cats literally had 9 lives. I would ask cat owners what life their cat was on or how many were left. I thankfully never asked how they lost her previous lives.

Garmin,f4h94lt,t3_dkf9k7,1571589336.0,"Can the time be always on or does it react to movement? That was my biggest frustration with the Fitbit Versa, I'd look at my watch and have to press the button to see the time because it didn't always recognize the wrist movement. It was a big reason I bought the Forerunner 45 a few months ago"

AskReddit,f4bj0ik,t1_f4arod7,1571513290.0,That's a very good point. My OBGYN referred me to a colleague of his that specializes in rarer things with the female body as he has tried everything he knows. I was referred 6 months ago and was called a little while ago and was told my appointment is at the end of November. If that doctor has no solutions I will definitely ask for a referral for a dermatologist. The problem is that the wait for a dermatologist is long (Canada).

I can't say my cartwheels are impressive by any means but practicing front tucks into a foam pit is a great way to spend an evening!"
