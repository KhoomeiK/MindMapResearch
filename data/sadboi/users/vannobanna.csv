Or what if the person has a partner and their family cares for them like a parent would? Or what if there are people who like caring for others that don’t see it as a burden- maybe it is even their career and it contributes to the economy... most of us depend in others at some point in life, and just about every child a parent brings into the world is going to need to depend on someone other than them, too."

I taught her “look at me” while inside first and then moved it outside. Whenever something triggering is around outside i would say look at me and treat right away. Then treat any time she looks at the thing but then looks back at me. Now she immediately sits and looks at me when she spots a dog or bike or person running! Sometimes her hair will go up and she is about to bark but she catches herself and looks at me instead for a treat. It helps that she is very very food motivated!!

Also, I don't know what's coming/what extra expenses I may have coming up and I live paycheck to paycheck so spending 100 dollars at once on groceries is dangerous for me- what if I need that in an emergency, I would rather have the funds available and go a little hungry than not have the funds available when I really need it.

For what it’s worth, my thoughts are that when someone says they don’t have the emotional capability to be in a relationship right now, believe them. She said it herself, and her actions are confirming it. It sounds like she knows she needs to be on her own and sort things out for herself before she can fully commit to a partner. Slowing the relationship down is not a bad idea, but stopping altogether without thinking that you will eventually get to a serious relationship status might be best in this situation.

Assuming this is anything other than an act of violence is especially ridiculous if you consider the alternative.

How likely is it that they meant to say this: “We love Greta, and therefore want to engage in fun, consensual sex with her. We like this idea and believe this so much that we will share it around, because we all just want to make consensual love to Greta and we want you to know that.”

Not likely. Legal mumbo jumbo about age aside, this depicts violence against a young woman because she shares ideas that are disagreed with. This has happened throughout history over and over and over again and it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out what is meant by the picture."

Let’s say you actually did intend to have sex with him (just for the purpose of this argument even though I know thats not the case)- what he did was still rape. You could he giving a person a blow job or whatever and change your mind- you say no, he doesn’t listen, that is rape no matter how you began the experience.

If your child happens to be the one in a million who becomes disabled from a rare complication, what happens then?

AskReddit,f62ak4x,t3_dq430b,1572655918.0,"Say yes to everything (within reason of course)- this is how I made friends in a new city. See a flyer for a cool band? Go and you just may meet some like minded people to sit and hang out with. Work throwing a bbq picnic or some other event? Do it, you might make some good connections there. Someone you are acquaintances with mentions having a board game night or something. Say i love boardgames, mind if i join?? Just do everything. The more places you go, the more chances you will meet people to be friends with."

Makes me nervous because I worry I might hurt them accidentally. I said no to holding my best friend’s newborn for this reason and no one chewed me out for it."

UnsolvedMysteries,f4qa58e,t1_f4q9dcd,1571750391.0,"I think you have blown my comment way outta proportion. A crime is committed (person raped and/or murdered), run perp’s dna through geneological database... find potential suspects, narrow it down and there ya go- criminal caught! Just don’t rape or murder people"

mentalillness,f4l9jd4,t3_dkvc3d,1571664192.0,"I was on a psych floor of a regular hospital. It was not like in the movies, aside from having to remove laces from sweatshirts and shoes, we all wore our normal clothes. There were activities every day- individual therapy, group therapy, group rec. between those and meals patients would just hang out in their rooms or in the common area where there was a little kitchen with coffee, tea, snacks, a tv, board games and cards, and a ping pong table. Some nurses were power trippers and just plain awful, but for the most part they were ok. The other patients can be very helpful. If you were a risk to yourself you would spend a couple days in “high obs” where the nurses can watch you 24/7. The longer you are there, and the better you get, the more freedom you get to go off the unit by yourself. Visitors were always welcome on evenings and weekends. I was there for 3 months, and while i wouldn’t want to do it again, it helped me because i got put on some new meds that really made a difference"
