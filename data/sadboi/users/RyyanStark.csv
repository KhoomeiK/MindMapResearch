mentalillness,fpr3wfm,t3_gejo69,1588841464.0,"I know exactly what you're talking about. I'm on Zoloft 150 mg and I too feel like a shell, empty and emotionless. But I kinda like it. This may sound like strange advice but isn't it better to not feel anything rather than that feeling of dread that comes from anxiety( i too have been diagnosed with general anxiety-severe in my case) Thats what i think anyways, stay safe."
Psychosis,fpqu5t3,t3_gerrg0,1588832323.0,"I actually increased my dose recently and I feel more alive? That's the best way I can describe it. I don't feel as dead, my thoughts are clearer.  If you're not tapering off it I don't know why you would decrease it. Perhaps you need time to adjust? Or perhaps you need some antidepressants in addition to your anti psychotics."

mentalillness,fp8iuhu,t3_gbo45j,1588393434.0,"Perhaps if it's not a psychological thing like schizophrenia then maybe there are things happening or that happened that you don't know about. Maybe he sustained abuse when he was younger, sexual physical emotional or something similar. This happens a lot when kids act out because they have anger over something horrible happening to them, all that repressed rage from the abuse. I think he needs someone he can fully trust and open up to about whats causing this anger. I hope everything works out with him, stay strong <3"
mentalillness,fp8iity,t3_gbotdg,1588393194.0,"It's repressed rage. I know exactly what you're talking about. It's the abuse that you sustained and all the anger that you repressed over the years built up into this toxic volatile thing inside you. I call it the dark passenger. What really helped me was medication, specifically risperdone and it changed my life. I really, really recommend you seek professional help and see a psychiatrist and therapist. When my dark passenger was constantly on my mind I'm sure I would have gone down a dark path and done bad things. I hope you get the help you need and im so sorry for what happened to you, but on the bright side we're not alone. You don't deserve the abuse that happened to you and you're not evil, those monsters that did this to you would qualify as evil, Stay safe, stay strong <3"
mentalillness,fp8hovs,t3_gbp3is,1588392574.0,"I think you need professional help. Mental health has a nasty way of compounding upon itself. Perhaps you just need someone to talk to and possibly medications to help you through this rough time. I only say this because that last bit sounds alarming "" I don’t want to be here anymore and I can’t do this "" I empathize entirely. I'm going through the same thing at school. The thing that gave me the ability to go through all this was the medication tbh. I was in a very dark place and having that stability really saved me. I hope you consider it as well it could really do wonders for you, it sounds like. If you need someone to talk to here is the crisis number  1-800-273-8255 Stay safe stay strong <3"

mentalillness,fp8h284,t3_gbqihb,1588392107.0,"I mean besides getting professional help there is no real advice anyone can give. I know what you're going through. It sounds like what happened when my depression went from mild to major. I couldn't function anymore. It was so bad I just wanted to die because It was a paradox. My depression got worse because my anxiety about not doing anything with my life and my anxiety got worse because my depression was getting worse. If you don't seek professional help I fear the only path you have is being stuck like that forever. I was for 6 years and NOTHING helped. Friends, girlfriends, a good life, school, videogames, nothing. You need a psychiatrist and therapy, major depression is a serious disease. Stay safe stay strong <3"
mentalillness,fp8gfu8,t3_gbx4jk,1588391654.0,I'm so sorry this is happening to you but I'm positive you are developing schizophrenia. Delusions are the beginning indicators and seeing and hearing things are when it's in full effect. I highly recommend you see a psychiatrist for a diagnoses and get the help it sounds like you need. Stay safe <3
mentalillness,fp8g29w,t3_gbt432,1588391382.0,Yes. I have a personality disorder as well but I never bothered to wear a mask. It kinda sucks because I don't have any of the compulsions that others have and cant connect with anyone. I feel like a different species among them and I cannot understand a lot of the things they do and why. But I have accepted it and I live a productive life.

offmychest,fp54z4j,t3_gb4mwi,1588316471.0,While i cannot relate to the specifics of your situation I completely empathize with that hate. The hatred and malice because of the abuser and you end up hate people and society because that person took everything from you. Wanting to get revenge and possibly do things that you get sent away for life. But from the bottom of my heart I recommend you get help. A psychiatrist and therapist can change your world. It did mine. And honestly I'm not going to bs you it sounds like you will always carry this with you but I hope you can at least live a decent life. Stay safe stay strong <3 don't let the beast inside take control!

mentalillness,fp54db3,t3_gax4qh,1588315912.0,He's a typical abuser. I'm so sorry this happened to you and I hope you get the help you need. I recommend going to a psychiatrist and therapist. The last bit I can actually relate to. I'm positive what you're experiencing is PTSD. I have that condition and thoughts or feeling like the ones you describe happen sometimes and its debilitating. Stay safe stay strong <3
relationship_advice,fp53t5g,t3_gb2j7t,1588315392.0,"For the love of god and everything holy in this world DON'T let them stop you from getting treatment. I also recommend getting a psychiatrist in addition to your therapy, meds + therapy most effective. This behavior is not normal and they're abusive loonies. I think the best thing moving forward is to try to cut them out of your life as much as possible and move on. I had parents like this, mother very similar expect she wasn't a drunk all the malice and hatred came from her heart. Don't let them mess you up anymore than you already are. My parents also left me with major depression and anxiety too. But m anxiety is severe and was debilitating. I really hope you stay safe and get the help you need. Stay safe stay strong <3"

offmychest,fp52n6v,t1_fp4jnl4,1588314345.0,"I second this. Focusing on yourself and what you need is the best ""treatment"" for people taking advantage of you and not reciprocating. Stay strong <3"

I rarely ""meet"" people who carry their own dark passenger so i sincerely hope you stay safe and get the help you need much love <3"

But mine was slightly different than yours, I dont feel the compulsion to seek out relationships because i just dont care. I know what you mean when you say everyone seems different, almost like they're a different species. But it's major depression that has you like this. I recommend treatment and speaking with a psychiatrist. Also WTF why does your ""friend"" want to see you naked and why tf do they feel entitled to it???"
