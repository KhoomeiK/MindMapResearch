I started thinking about ghosts and all the paranormal Reddit stories for no reason at all. I started thinking how nothing had happened to me and started wondering if ghosts actually existed. I then closed my eyes for a few seconds but as soon as I closed my eyes, my body shook and I heard this low pitched noise, similar to the wind or breathing into a microphone. Then I heard this really high-pitched noise. Like those videos on YouTube that have a noise from a low pitch to high pitch, that was the high pitched noise I heard. And evidently, my parents hadn't heard a thing as they continued getting ready for work as normal. After I opened my eyes, my lips were really dry and you know when your hand goes a bit numb and when you touch it, it feels like it's someone else's hand? That's what my lips felt like! It was so strange and I cant explain it."
