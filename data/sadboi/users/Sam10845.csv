I was working there part-time, and  part-time working as a phlebotomist.  My medical career was always my backup so at the hardware store I started giving less fucks.  So I would shout some snide remark like "" yo customer! or ""yo dude!"".

I was a young cute looking girl, working in the paint & hardware department. The staff were educated on tools and I knew their proper names and how to use them. I also paid attention when I helped my dad remodel two houses. My favorite was when a older male customer would ask ""excuse me sugar\sweetie\princess, can you get one of the men to help me with this ...."" . So I started to respond with ""sure thing cupcake"" I would get one of my male co-workers to help and I would stand right next to them as they explained exactly what I just told the customer.

TLDR; my boyfriend saw a porno saved to my computer, thought it was me, I came home early from work, proved it wasn't, gave us both heart attacks.


 Me and my boyfriend both watch porn, not together, but separately. I have a laptop that we both use and I call it a family-friendly laptop because occasionally my dad will borrow it. (Both of my grandparents are in their 90's and he has made several slideshows celebrating their birthdays\60 year marriage\family reunions type stuff.)
My boyfriend was using the laptop one day and there was a video that was downloaded twice. He opened it up and it was a short, amateur filmed porno. It was a little fuzzy, but the girl that happened to be blindfolded in the video looked like me. I happen to be at work when I got a call from my boyfriend asking me about it very aggressively. He asked me who the fuck was this guy, he said it was definitely me, it looks like me and sounds like me. He tells me not to play dumb and he knows exactly what I'm talking about. And my red and black plaid long-sleeve is on the floor next to them fucking. (First of all, everyone owns a red plaid shirt) I of course have no idea what he is talking about but I could tell how crazy enraged he was and I was so panicked from him yelling at me and me just being completely clueless on what he is talking about.
I couldn't let him go the rest of my shift thinking that I was this girl in this video and him thinking I cheated. So I left work for a ""medical emergency"".
I get home and I'm watching this video, I guess she does kind of look and her moans sound like me... I guess? but it was difficult to get a good image. The video looked up from the girl and looked around the room. I do not recognize this room. I start to question myself thinking if I was drunk and don't remember or whatever. Maybe the guy was recording without my permission.
Finally, after watching the video 50 ficking times and pausing and playing through each damn frame, I noticed the girl has bangs, I do not have bangs. She also has  two moles on her butt, I do not.
I screenshot these frames and call my boyfriend back over.he knows damn well what my butt looks like but still has me pull my pants down to check for any moles on my butt. He realizes that the girl is not me and comes out of his panic attack. he asked me why I downloaded the video. I have no recollection of this, I do not use the laptop for porn usage. The only thing I could possibly think of is I clicked on a video file my phone skipped or was buffering and I accidentally downloaded it, And my accounts which are linked, saved it to the laptop. (I don't even know if that is possible, I'm not very tech savvy.)

At the end I was really pissed off I had to come home from work, I got a warning about my ""occurrences"" (being late, forgetting to clock out, leaving work early, all counts against us.) and I was still kind of salty about my boyfriend screaming at me or the phone for no reason. The video has been deleted and everything is back to normal."

When I was a freshman in high school I was put on the medication concerta to help with my ADD (I also have dyslexia). It was my miracle drug! It worked amazingly and I began remembering things from class, doing homework in a timely fashion, and answering the teacher's questions accurately. The school later found out  that I was self-injuring in my sophomore year. I had to go see a therapist, and go for a psychiatric evaluation before I could return back to school. Because of this, I was taken off of concerta. It wasn't until years later in college I was having a very difficult time understanding information and retaining it. A psychiatrist put me back on concerta and we weren't seeing results so she upped the dose. She prescribed the highest dose possible and I still saw no improvement."

rtms,f1l7h02,t1_f1k4zla,1569547532.0,"I have an AMAZING psychiatrist. Things I've notiticed about a good dr is:
1) They take the time to listen to you, even when you ramble. The things 
 you ramble about or the WAY you ramble is just as important as all the other stuff.
2) They ask about your background. Relationship with parents, past traumas, other things of that nature.
3) When they make a change to a dose, add or take you off a drug, they explain why they made that choice and what you can expect from the change and what the plans are moving forward in you treatment plan.

About the medication situation.... to me, it seems kinda stupid that your doctor is so quick to dismiss TMS saying your insurance wont cover it, but then give you $1400 of medications to pay. I have a 'middle-of-the-road' insurance plan and the only reason they approved me for TMS is because of the number of fail anti-depressants I had tried throughout the 10+ years of suffering I've endured.  It's a pain in the butt, but I'd say first step is to log into your insurance account (or whatever) and search for a psychiatrist in your network and find their reviews. Pick your top 3 or 4 and call to see when is the soonest you can come in.
Im not sure what the difference is between rTMS and dTMS.  So now I'm curious.  I'm currently getting TMS treatment at RUSH Medical Center in Chicago.  I found out that RUSH had clinical trials and worked to help get TMS approved by the FDA in 2008. They use the NEUROSTAR machine, but you said to say away from it. Can I ask way that is?

The first week of it I was just so happening to have some good days, this week I've been very moody and agitated. I'm currently on treatment #9 and was told I can possibly start seeing an improvement in myself as early as treatment #20 to as late as weeks after the TMS treatment ended.  Every brain is different.  I'm still optimistic about TMS though.  I'm 28 years old and I just want to some ""young-happy"" years to look back on."

I definitely know the difference between a headache and a migraine. After my TMS treatments I have a dull headache afterwards but it goes away within 20 minutes or so.
 The other day, I was sitting on my couch about 5 hours after my treatment and I felt a migraine coming on. I'd say it was are 6/10 on the pain scale. And within 3 minutes, it went up to a 9! I haven't had a migraine that bad in years!  I made sure the next day to tell the TMS people about it and they asked a few questions but because it was about 5 hours after tms, they said they weren't very concerned about it. It just so happened that I got a bad migraine in the course of my treatments. 

 Please encourage him to stick with the treatment. So many people have told me so many great things about it and I currently work at the hospital where I am receiving my treatments.

( My mom and her sisters (who are nurses) called my grandmothers doctor to let him know that she has been extremely forgetful lately and has no concept of time. we've always figure she had some type of dementia but it was getting increasingly worse. Long story short, she has been officially diagnosed with dementia, we found out that she is confusing her medication and she does not know what year it is nor what a pen is used for.

 We found out that every time she would go to the doctor she would say everything is fine and blah blah blah. I'm glad that a simple 5 minute phone call helped us better understand what is going on and now we can all properly take care of her.

AskReddit,esiydhp,t1_esiebwz,1562022581.0,"Sometimes they just tell me that the patient is ""cool"" and send me on my way to draw them alone. But I don't trust that shit and anyone can snap at anytime. I always ask them to come along"
AskReddit,eshc0d9,t3_c7qrz4,1561988958.0,"Not a nurse, but as a phlebotomist that would occasionly go to the psychiatric floors for blood draws. I had to be extremely careful with supplies that I took with me in the room and made sure I had to leave with every piece of plastic I left behind.  Whether the patient was violent or not, I always wanted to have a staff member with me.  
But anyway, I was drawing blood from an 8ish year old boy and he was asking me questions I wasn't sure how to answer to a pediatric psych patient. So I would ask him questions about his favorite foods and he told me that he doesn't sleep at night because it is too dangerous. (Not sure if the parents did anything violent to the boy at night)
 He told me that his favorite food was peanut butter because he was a dog.

At the surface it might  just seem like a kid playing around. But I have no idea what kind of abuse this kid has endured and I'm pretty sure he was fucked up because of his parents and that's why he was there.  Just the way he was acting and his mannerisms weren't like a normal kid.  I saw bite mark scars on him and he mentioned something about people biting him. 
It was weird."

I'd say, (if it's safe to) leave out the new lube and have other lotion bottles around it to camouflage it. Put it on your nightstand or something and act casual."

Advice,eqq7vt3,t3_byxpw0,1560214417.0,"Medical person here! 90% of the population has herpes. 
I had no symptoms until the age of 24 (ish?) I did some digging and found out that my dad got it when he was younger from some random girl, he only had one break out, married my mom and passed it to her. She NEVER had an out break. Passed it onto me from birth. (Not from me growing inside her, but was spread to me from contact.) I was born with it and had absolutely no idea. I asked to be tested for it at a free STD clinic,  but they said they only do the test if you have symptoms.  Herpes is weird and tricky to understand.  Do some research before you judge others.  You can still get it through condoms. So unfortunately the only 'safe sex' is no sex. The herp ain't that bad as what society makes it seem."
selfharm,epo3qx9,t3_bv7dua,1559337922.0,"I just went through something like this on St. Patrick's day.  Got drunk, was having fun, went to the half remodeled bathroom to pee, saw a box cutter, starting cutting my wrist and dripped blood on the floor and sink. Not only that, but in my drinkin stuper, I snapchated it to a person/friend I was growing closer to. I hated myself, and my friend didn't want to be my friend anymore because I'm too triggering for her.
I paid close attention to my drinking and stopped for a while until my mental health improved. And if I did drink, it was only going to be 2 drinks. NO shots. And NO Jameson."
