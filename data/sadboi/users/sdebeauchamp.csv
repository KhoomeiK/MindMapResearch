I'm much less worried about the question compared to the response just like I was far less worried about his rhetoric on the campaign trail compared to the thousands of cheering people in the audience. She absolutely should never have gotten in the room, but she did and as expected he loves it. He never should have been able to get in the room either, but a scary number of people love it. Those who support, bolster and legitimize crazy are more responsible for the continuance of crazy than the person who spouted the crazy. There's all sorts of people with every different opinion and that makes us strong, but we need to have a majority of sane people who can hear the crazy talk and treat it appropriately.

We're in the food chain top spot due to (in part) the social aspect of our nature. Otherwise it would be octopuses (I checked, it's Greek not Latin). 

Our (USA) political body is currently in direct conflict with the laws of nature (minority rule due to the system of politics that gives favor to the minority...electoral college/gerrymandering/super delegates). It's no wonder we've found ourselves so divided.
