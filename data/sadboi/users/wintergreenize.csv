relationship_advice,ewpo730,t3_cpiunh,1565645494.0,If you wanted to keep your baby more than anything then you wouldn't need your husband especially when he's made it clear he doesn't want one. He won't have a choice in giving you child support. But he does have a choice in not being physically involved. Honestly it's up to you. You either do this physically alone and get the courts involved for child support or give in to what your husband wants if you want to be with him more. He's made it more than clear he doesn't want a kid. He sounds like a douche and you sound like you might be too emotionaly invested in him to do it without him. You really should go into councelling whether you end up deciding to stay with him or not. His behaviour is not rational
socialskills,ewhkfh6,t3_codebm,1565410974.0,If you think she's physically perfect I'm sure you're not the only one. He probably tryna call dibs but that's what I would assume then again i let my imagination go wild lol
happy,ew5i63l,t3_cmygp2,1565136865.0,"he doesn't like fruit. he's a huge veggie lover. cilantro so far is his favorite. I've seen his popcorn so many times already and because my bpd still question if he's happy. he's quite a simple pig. I imagine he had a hard life before I adopted him, he's extremely grateful for alot of simple things üòç. we both seem to be introverted, doesn't like to come out alot but he likes hearing me read :)"
canada,ew2ucf4,t3_cmk9vg,1565056074.0,Because you pay for breakfast at restaurants lmao. Breakfast at hotels are COMPLIMENTARY. Take it or leave it.
relationship_advice,ev9vc21,t3_cily9l,1564332166.0,Lmao you sound like a teenager. We broke up so I'm trying to make her jealous with a new girl. Why the fuck would she want you back when you're already dating someone else. You have kid ofc she's gonna be around. Fucking man up and tell her you didn't treat her right instead of trying to treat someone else right in front of her. She's probably thinking why the fuck didn't he ever do that for me.  Trying to be strategic? Sounds more like you're trying to trick your ex wife into being with you again instead of having a grown ass talk. Stop playing games
guineapigs,ev1cyww,t1_ev1ccn4,1564156199.0,"Yah just on the fact alone everyone is saying I should get another one, makes me feel stupid for getting him in the first place. I think I'll talk to my bf when he gets home, we already spend over 200 for his other things, so if he needs another friend he should probably try to find a new forever home unfortunately. I wish I wasn't so rash on buying him i tend to do that alot. I might have to suck my losses with this one. Thank you for the advice!"
guineapigs,ev1bjps,t1_ev1a5qw,1564155533.0,"I think his cage is fine. It looks like a rabbit cage, they charged another 100 for it. If he's still skittish within a few days I may have to return him. I definitely don't want another guinea pig. Hopeful someone else can look after him better then me. It makes me anxious how I already feel he's so unhappy here."
self,euk73ti,t3_cgrovi,1563884263.0,üíô going through something like similar. hope it gets better for you.
relationship_advice,euh2dtl,t3_cggsad,1563819565.0,"Honestly it sounds like the only thing you could do is wait the 9 months. No sense stressing until then. If it's yours, you'll have to send chill support. If it's not or no baby comes in 9 months just be more careful online and who you have sex with casually."
relationship_advice,eu90d4e,t3_cfcqe4,1563568799.0,You're gonna keep doing it until you're ready to stop. I doubt anyone here can convince you otherwise. I just hope you learn to value yourself alot more than you have been.
relationship_advice,eu2e7hb,t3_cegojq,1563388181.0,"He shouldn't be in love with his ex. If he is maybe you should still just be supporting him as a friend. If he's still in love with his ex, you're the rebound. To be fair, no one should start a new relationship until their over their last one. Easier said then done"

BPD,etlmko4,t1_etlm7qt,1562940383.0,"I get that too. I know how to apologize when I'm wrong because I'm been wrong alot of times but there's are arguments I feel are valid and he'll say babe you're just overreacting. I didn't get the full story sorry and its usually safe to assume we're overreacting but  if you feel honestly feel and know the background then I think what you did was fine. Explain you still think in that certain situation you weren't being a abusive, but still sorry that it made her feel that way.  just got a bit passionate it sounds. Hope it gets better between you two though, a fight isn't worth being against each other :)"
BPD,etll8ae,t3_cc9q0l,1562939427.0,"If you reacted way out of hand for something small and made her feel like shit it sounds emotionally abusive. Whether you meant to or not. I have bpd and I over react on stuff all the time and my bf will say no it's okay you called me this and that when your mad, well it's not and it makes me feel like shit he thinks like this. My anger isn't something he should have to deal with if it's gonna be directed at him personally. Abuse isn't always intentional I'm sure most of the time it isn't."
toronto,etj9yoh,t3_cbyfhk,1562869206.0,Badger it looks like. Should report next time. They're getting to be extincted.
BPD,etj962e,t3_cbyfit,1562868721.0,Honestly I have bpd and I don't see it like that. Stop talking to that person period. At least for now. Like you cheated and I'm not trying to make you feel bad but you did something terrible and you got to do the necessary to stop it. Block them. Remove them. At least until your husband can trust you..
BPD,etj8a6g,t3_cbyfit,1562868177.0,"If your husband has already asked you to stop talking to this person and you just absolutely can't maybe it's best if you and your husband seperate. I'd feel shitty af knowing my husband cheated on me and then wouldn't stop talking to the person because it's their favorite person. It's probably hard for you but its not fair to him. If your still talking to you fp and you absolutely knows he doesn't want to be with you, you'd be stringing along your husband at that point unwillingly."
BPD,etj35qt,t1_etj2swk,1562865277.0,"Sadly our BF's must have different personalities. My bf would rather prefer sitting in a corner of the room hyperventilating trying to push him out until I feel better, opposed to the treatment he would get. Maybe try to explain to your bf how angry you get. That you understand your angry is over the top and you need to do something physical to stop it.  If it's like mine it's explosive and harsh and not normal for the situation it starts from and usually my angry is coming from a past thought I project on him."
BPD,etj1vjm,t3_cby329,1562864554.0,"I'm like this usually with my bf. (Then again that's all I talk to really ha) For me what's been helpful when we start fighting, or when he starts saying things that trigger me I would literally have to fucking close my ears LITERALLY so I won't hear them, and sit in my head and try to rationalize. Am I really this mad, would it better to walk away rn ect. It's probably not the best advise in public but it's all I got ha. Hope you find something that works!"
relationship_advice,et324z6,t3_c9ulxl,1562426697.0,Funny you're calling somewhere you don't pay for shit is a rip off lmao.  So you're just gonna act like your doing your mom a favor when in reality you just don't wanna move out and start paying for your own shit.
relationship_advice,esh4l5y,t3_c7rk8d,1561982129.0,You read her diary. Which she probably writes in when she's frustrated. Don't read her diary. I'd probably need to write a few things down too after crying most of the night.

BPD,eqrolfd,t1_eqrnl3f,1560266160.0,When you asked of you two were on a break or separated and you got that answer honestly you should have told her you can't accept that. If she wants to sleep around then you should try to move on. It hurts and it sucks but you don't deserve her behaviour towards you with no solid remorse
BPD,eqrn5f4,t3_bzdh9i,1560265152.0,"honestly bpd doesn't give you a pass to be an ass. When I was doing such crazy fucking shit like that I was not happy. She might not be either. But she needs counselling she needs therapy she doesn't just get to do whatever she wants without consequences. You should have given ultimatums, and I guess if you want to wait that's up to you but you're setting yourself up for a life of being taken advantage of."

You need to grow up and think about other people. You only give a shit about you if your even considering cheating. It's tempting?? Leave him then wtf. And say these feelings are true? How to gonna tell him? I cheated on you to see if I like woman and I do so seeyah? Smh

relationship_advice,eobvjrz,t1_eobv3ab,1558449024.0,"Honestly there's nothing embarrassing saying yeah it was because of you. Because you did want to be with him. That's not embarassing.
