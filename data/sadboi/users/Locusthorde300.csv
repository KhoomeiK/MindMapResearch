A general strike would basically force the company to send teams to meet demands of workers.

The rest of these aren't directly similar to UBI, nor are they exclusive.

Downfall has this kind of requirement with different not perfectly balanced species. This is assuming peak operating, there are situations and environments where different creatures may have their AP reduced. Snakes can't effectively push themselves harder like leg based creatures to ""sprint"", without doing something goofy like coiling their tail and jumping like a kangaroo.

> I don't think the approach I offered was perfect. It caps out slow characters from dumping all their AP into movement in vain.

That's what the current cap/bonus system does. But lets slower characters keep their APs to use on other actions. If a Naskian (snake person) has 12 AP with 50% speed; 2AP to move = capping movement at 6AP (1AP to move). Except with the latter the player still retains 6AP to perform actions. and it's less complicated than having different AP values for each bracket of distance. A kanus (Worgen, basically) with 12AP that has (for example) 200% speed; 0.5 AP to move (1ap:2sq) = getting 12AP bonus movement, but you still retain that first 12AP for other actions. Though you have the option to spend the total AP+Bonus of 24AP to move 24 squares.

Bracketing speeds and increasing AP costs breaks the current AP system (and it's attachments), and makes players have to dedicate more towards bookkeeping than I would like. The easiest way to do this would have hyper inflated AP pools (triple digits) and having 1 square = 10AP. Fast creatures move at 8 or 6 AP, slow creatures move at 12 or 14 AP. But that would just make gameplay massively crunchy.

Having X AP = Y Movement also makes the system essentially ""Big"" Action points (D&D, Shadowrun videogames, new XCOM, etc). Which is what DF used to be, and what I'm trying to get away from because I dislike the restrictions it places. If I have a movement of 6sq, and I want to move 1-2sq, it's kind of annoying to have to spend 1 of my 2-3 AP just to move a little bit.

Not the best system, but it's simulating movement with small APs. And doesn't require the player to do much mental math past the character creation phase."

Not the intended way of doing it. You would move the ratio, and spend an extra AP on the last movement. So if it cost 4AP to move 3 squares, you would spend an extra AP on the last square. Though, for obvious reasons that was really clunky and why I made this thread.

That's a speed gating system, I'm not so sure about that. I'd have to think about it. the 10' increment would be double the current speed.

Sorry, I meant AP, not XP. I was typing quickly and didn't catch it before I hit send.

Doing solid AP bonuses seemed to scale poorly, so the idea now is percentages of bonus/penalized movement.

    Very fast +50%
    Fast      +25%
    Normal      0%
    Slow      -25%
    Very slow -50%

Slow would round up, to lower the loss of AP. Where Fast would round down to lower the gain of AP. A constant +X bonus/penalty would be really good/bad at lower ""levels"" compared to a character who has spend a ton of XP on increasing their attributes."

> If it helps, I'm asking about the cognitive load you expect players to bear. ""Crunch"" is a bad term because the definition varies person to person. I get more useful mileage with ""addition"", ""subtraction"", etc.

I'm fine with a bit of math, but it should all be relatively simple, and doable without a graphing calculator.

For example, the formula for Action Points is;

    ((Dexterity + Endurance) / 2v) + 8 ... (9-18AP)

You're welcome, thank YOU for helping.

> It sounds like you've got an ""XP"" currency too, which might become necessary to expound upon, so please let us know what that's about.

Players build characters with XP pools, using a backstory/life generation module system in which each module costs XP to buy. Each module is equal to the cost of what attribute/skill bonuses it gives.

    Life Stages
    0 - Species
    1 - Affiliation (which faction/nation you grew up in)
    2 - Childhood
    3 - Adolescence
    4 - Higher Education
    5 - Real Life (Jobs, careers, etc)

> So, what are your thoughts about the boundaries of this system? You've got numbers it looks like in the double-digits. I presume you'll avoid triple-digits? Will operations be limited to addition and subtraction? You mention that you're trying to avoid ratios (division) due to the cognitive load and bookeeping that foists upon the players.

Definitely don't want to be in the double digits, nor any ""crunch"" in the middle of any action, reserving it to character creation or other times. NESW movement is 1AP, diagonal movement is 1.5. I'm roughly basing the AP limits on the actions that are allowed in other RPGs. To use D&D for example, a standard character can take a move action to move 6 squares, and then a major action like attacking. My RPG group typically house rules that you can NOT move and get two major actions instead. This developed into essentially ""big"" action points, where you get 2 AP, and each major action is 1 AP. Though, this still had the weirdness of ""Can I move 5ft and not spend an AP?"" which is how the ""small"" AP came around with 1AP = 1SQ. Adding aliens and whatnot just made it more complicated.

> My initial thought is just to have the ""speed categories"" require a static bonus (or spend) of AP. eg, if the miniature is in the ""4th tier"" category, they get to add 8 squares of movement, if they're in the ""-4th tier"" category, they must spend an additional 8 AP if they do any movement.

That's a good thought. I was pondering it since I posted, my idea is giving faster characters free AP to spend on movement only, and slower characters a reduction of AP they can spend on movement.

Two characters may both have 12AP for general actions, but the faster one would be able to move while using the full extent of their 12AP. Where the slower one might have to choose moving over staying still and using actions. Surface level thought is that this would kind of cement the playstyle of species. Faster species being more aggressive, while slower species are more defensive, or set up to ""ambush"" instead of assault if that makes sense.

I'm just not sure if there's any issues that are immediately apparent that I'm not seeing."

survarium,fmxrn2b,t1_fmw14oj,1586470535.0,"> Since you mention Mordhau, I can tell you that Survarium has around 6,000-8,000 active players every day (depending on if it is weekend or not), and around 40k-50k monthly. Peak hour numbers on a normal day are about 2,000 online at the same time. I think that losing 10-20% active players in 2 years (talking about Survarium) for a game with no major publisher, no marketing support and weird gameplay is a good result. And it's not just my opinion.

Pretty much all of this is just straight up false with a simple Steam chart. https://steamcharts.com/app/355840

Steam doesn't show total daily active players, sadly. Though the rest of the stats are very telling.

I actually misread this chart at first. The average active players ***per month*** is not 40-50k... but is around 300-400 players.

Peak players ***monthly*** hasn't gone above 1000 since ***November 2017***.

Peak daily players from their chart is roughly 500, rarely getting up to 600. Not 2000.

When the game hit steam, it's all time peak was 4,340 players. It's 24 hour peak is 460 players. Two years ago it's peak was 813 players. It's bled it's peak active players by roughly 50% since two years ago. And roughly 90% since launch.

You must've literally pulled all of those numbers out of thin air. This game is practically dead, for all intents and purposes.
