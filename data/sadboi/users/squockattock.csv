todayilearned,foit7yd,t1_foisu12,1587796239.0,I fucking cackled holy shit. Yeah basically LOL
todayilearned,fohy1y2,t3_g7e152,1587774866.0,In Texas they’re considered an invasive species and its legal to hunt them.
funny,fohxmnt,t3_g7h5e3,1587774627.0,Oh my god this was way too cute!!!!
AskReddit,fodftxl,t3_g6mag1,1587684159.0,18. I laughed and said “That was neat.”
BPD,fo9lwu6,t3_g6give,1587623416.0,I’m the same way. Kind of bizarre because I don’t generally want to do that sort of thing.
WritingPrompts,fo9lrq4,t1_fo7pu9s,1587623288.0,Aw man I’m crying!!
BPD,fo7kekn,t3_g61u5j,1587579832.0,Yeeeppppp. If I could stop getting a FP that would be neato.
BPD,fn4iaoq,t1_fn4huad,1586641955.0,Thank you. I appreciate this.
BPD,fn4g9od,t1_fn4g6gl,1586640774.0,"It’s absolutely irrational, and I recognize this. I’m afraid of getting older and that’s all."
BPD,fn2bslh,t3_fyvgan,1586583705.0,"I’m 29 and feel like now I’m like...done? No one wants 30 year olds. I mean, I do, but I feel like once I hit 30, I’ll tip the peak of quirky straight into weird territory."
AskReddit,fmh6wba,t1_fmg10w1,1586068738.0,"Damn, that’s impressive! My Fallout 4 fic has gotten five lol"
mildlyinteresting,fmh6rdo,t3_fv6lz8,1586068603.0,Yellow is my absolute favorite. I knew they were skimping on yellow!!
AskReddit,fmdjdvo,t3_fuj2lg,1585969336.0,"Most of the time, mostly because I feel like people are gonna yell at me for having that particular opinion. I’ve had people tell me I’m stupid for going “awwwww” at a cute cat pic so I’ve pretty much just stuck to upvoting."
BPD,fmd53c5,t1_fmd10yr,1585959511.0,My sister was like that. She meant only specific people SHE wanted attention from weren’t meeting her needs. Everyone else could go fuck themselves basically.
BPD,flv2po3,t3_frb7u2,1585515137.0,"Yeah, I don’t like new people."
BPD,flrubya,t3_fqrmoh,1585428026.0,"I don’t, I’m sorry. I know how you feel, though. I think about them constantly and it drives me fucking nuts."
NoSleepOOC,flphg48,t1_flpfyni,1585359570.0,I’m too chickenshit to read that one lol
NoSleepOOC,floe8g7,t3_fq3aj9,1585336607.0,That story fucked me up so bad honestly.
WritingPrompts,flle7wn,t1_fll0wyy,1585258646.0,I shrieked at Lizzo lol

BPD,fl8hgh0,t3_fn8tqg,1584923773.0,"Yep. I once became obsessed with a couple, together. I tried really hard to not make it weird, and ended up going no contact with them because the guy ended up being a weirdo anyways."
AskReddit,fl7zygh,t3_fn0tmk,1584912978.0,The outside world finally matches what I feel inside all the time. It’s oddly comforting and unsettling at the same time. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone.
NoSleepOOC,fl7y6sd,t3_fn6a1k,1584911897.0,"Oh my god, I’m so excited!!"
AskReddit,fl2rbuh,t1_fl1xak4,1584757937.0,I love him so much. He just...slapped people lmfao. I mean he did other things but that’s always struck me as the funniest thing.
AskReddit,fl2q352,t1_fl2du2o,1584757052.0,UHHHH
BPD,fktz5au,t3_fkku4x,1584538528.0,Yep. I have to throw a temper tantrum before I can let it go. Otherwise I can hold onto it for days.

BPD,fksgnav,t3_fkd1gt,1584489645.0,I get dizzy and have to sit at how quickly my emotions change. It’s a physical reaction.
BPD,fklpg4y,t3_fj8nbd,1584311699.0,"Recognition makes me upset, but I like...need it. I think it’s the introversion battling the BPD. I want people to be proud of me, and I want them to praise me, but also, don’t? Don’t do that, please?"
BPD,fkldzhw,t1_fkkj8lv,1584304272.0,Yes! I do this. I accidentally taught it to my son as “washing the bad feelings away.” And now he does it when he feels upset or sick.
BPD,fkkgluf,t3_fj08o5,1584283527.0,"Yes! I feel dizzy and get chest pains or feel like something is burning in my hands, face, and neck."
BPD,fkjek7q,t3_fiv5x2,1584243648.0,I just did the same thing two days ago. I feel so empty. I can absolutely relate.
