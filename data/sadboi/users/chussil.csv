PublicFreakout,fqvfrgn,t1_fqve05e,1589676333.0,"I get what you’re saying. I’ve worked in roles where you need to build relationships (in fact, the industry didn’t have a much better reputation than car salesmen), I understand how important that is...and it’s probably why I take such offense to this stuff. It’s rare that someone in your line of work actually understands how important that is. 

I was young and didn’t know better (certainly didn’t know it was illegal). It was bad, they made me sign all the paperwork, and paid $2000 which I was told cover my entire due at signing. I thought it was weird it was such a round number, but didn’t think much of it. When I came back the next day, I was told it was just a “down payment”. Guy tried to make it seem like he helped me out the day before by making the number nice and simple. We argued for an hour before I walked out. 

I was definitely using a bit of hyperbole, but salesmen have to prove to me that they can be trusted. I personally prefer brokers now because you don’t have to deal with the bs. I’m a straight shooter, the bs run around is antithetical to who I am and just can’t deal with it."
PublicFreakout,fqvd4pv,t1_fqvbdsd,1589674748.0,"A couple bad apples ruin the bunch. Really a shame. I once had a salesmen take $2000 from me to cover my due at signing and told me to come back the next day to finish up. I went into finance and was asked for another $1500 that we’d never discussed the day before. Had another guy use a lower tax rate from the town over to calculate my taxes so it would seem lower to close the deal. Got into finance and obviously that’s when I found out it was more. I get that not all car salesmen are like that, but in my experience, I’ve been fucked over more times than not. If you conduct yourself the way you say, than hats off to you, I respect the shit out of that. We all gotta make a living, some of us are just less genuine than others. That said, I will be eternally jaded when buying a car because of those bad apples."

My thoughts would race as if I was having an anxiety attack, but I couldn’t reach the same level of physical reaction....which in tern caused me to over think more because I thought something was wrong. I would find myself feeling like I was missing a part of life and hoping I could reach that level again to almost feel “alive” or “normal” again.

On the flip side, Best Buy offers professional calibration with high end equipment (that I assume will work with DV) for $50 cheaper. The problem is, with the current health crisis, who the hell wants someone coming into their home (not to mention I live in a heavily impacted area). Also...it’s only a $500 TV.

Like I said in that post, I think the media is an easy target, I’m mostly just sick of the blind partisanship that has truly infected the US. It could be a product of my environment - I work in Manhattan, an area of blind partisanship favoring the left, and live about an hour outside of the city, which happens to be an area of blind partisanship favoring the right - but I can’t stand the lack of nuance that I see on the news and in real life. Maybe I’m too analytical, or maybe it’s because I’m always looking to see what their bias/agenda is, but I take issue with what CNN is saying here because I’m reading through the lines and I know what they’re trying to insinuate. I don’t think this is just blind reporting of the facts. 

All this said, I want to make it clear that as of right now I think reopening for the vast majority of the country is wrong. Honestly, I think New York is the only state that can even consider it at the moment as we’ve seen a fairly consistent downward trend while the rest of the country continues to see upticks. But even with that downward momentum, we still see 1000 new cases and 200+ deaths per day which is far too high to reopen. 

It’s funny you bring up that post because it was actually extremely helpful. I’ve cut out heavily biased news outlets from my consumption. Going forward it’s exclusively AP, Reuter’s, and Bloomberg with a dash of NYT and WSJ if I want a slightly biased perspective from either side."

Just report the news and let the people decide if they agree or not. Don’t tell them what to think by framing it as right wrong/left good (or vice versa). Not only did they point out that the governor was Republican, but when the governor touted measures they are taking (hydroxychloroquine), CNN tried to tie it to Trump and subtly say “Trump pushed this, so it’s not good and you shouldn’t agree”.

I think openings/closures is very much a regional thing. I live in downstate New York, it’s fucking insane right now and you’d have to be fucking dumb to think opening my area is a good idea. That said, I know much of the US is not in the same position that we are, and they may be able to effectively open right now while also containing the spread. If reopening makes sense for them (local infection rates are low respective to the rest of the country - and decreasing - and there’s no fear that hospitals are in danger of being overwhelmed) and the state has an effective plan that will theoretically handle the inevitable increased spread, than I’m OK with it. There’s no way we can wait until new daily infection rates hit zero before reopening the entire country - that won’t happen for a year."
