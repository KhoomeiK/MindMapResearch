BPD,fp5i6vh,t1_fp2y3h9,1588330285.0,"Thank you for the DBT TIPP tip. I found it online and used it today morning. It was really helpful.
Also, so much love for the emotional support you extended. It helps knowing that I'm not alone, and if nothing else, there are so many people who understand and who'll be there for me and who I can someday, hopefully, be there for."
BPD,fp5i2d9,t1_fp2iblb,1588330161.0,I think the biggest thing you said was reminding me to be kind to myself. It's something I constantly struggle with and someone reminding me to do that was just what I needed. Thank you.
