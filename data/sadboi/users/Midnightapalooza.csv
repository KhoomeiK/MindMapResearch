Metalcore,fr65ey3,t1_fr4mowi,1589920225.0,"Paramore and BMTH are definitely the two best examples in my opinion. I guess Paramore were never *super* heavy, what with being pop punk and all, but their most recent album was fucking excellent. Honestly, I think After Laughter might be one of their best, I put it right up there with Riot and Brand New Eyes. 

BMTH... I really like all versions of BMTH a whole lot. My favorite album of theirs is TIAH and it probably always will be, but Sempiternal has such a fantastic sound, TTS is a very emotionally charged album for me, and Amo has a handful of my favorite BMTH songs of all time. Nihilist Blues is... one of the best songs they’ve ever written in my opinion, like top five easy. 

So yeah. It totally can be done well. I’m never going to disparage a band if they choose to step away from their initial style. Not everyone wants to continue writing heavy shit forever, and some bands/singers literally *can’t* write heavy shit forever. Sometimes you can only do the same thing for so long before you find yourself wanting something more. I’ve heard the phrase “the best hardcore bands always leave hardcore”, or something like it, and I think that’s honesty true. I love hardcore and metalcore, it’s my pop music and I’ll eat anything up that sounds like that, but you know what? These genres can, sometimes, be limiting- and sometimes the best bands can crave something new, fresh, exciting. 

But of course, simply writing a softer album doesn’t automatically make you good. Writing in a new style doesn’t automatically make you good. You still have to write great music first and foremost. That great music can be something totally unlike anything you’ve ever done, but the quality has to be there. And frankly, I just don’t think many bands from this scene, even really good ones like Bullet, are all that good at writing in those styles. It takes a lot of talent and creativity to totally change your sound and be successful, and not everyone has that. Doesn’t mean we’re shitting on it because there’s not enough screaming or breakdowns, it means we’re shitting on it because it sucks."
Falcom,fr5vvmw,t1_fr5ralp,1589915533.0,"Thanks for the information! Yeah, I looked up a bit for 3rd because it’s not on Vita (which is what I’m playing FC and SC on), so I was curious what its deal was. I’m sure I’ll end up playing it because it seems important, but I initially got the impression that it wasn’t. Now I know that I will definitely play through all three Sky games before moving on!

Your play order for Crossbell and Erebonia is interesting to me- do you have any specific reasons for why you think this is the best way to play? To be honest, while it’s work that I’m likely willing to do since I love these games so much, Crossbell seems like a *lot* of effort and doing things I’m not really comfortable doing just to get to play them. I don’t really like piracy, which seems like maybe the only option for one of the games, and I’m not super well-versed in modding either. I also don’t really like PC gaming but that’s a personal thing that I’ll put to the side for the sake of continuing to experience these games. So, if there’s even the slightest chance that Crossbell could be brought to PS4, I kind of would love to wait for that... but I also don’t want to wait because I’m just loving the game so much that I want to know that the next one is an option as soon as I’m ready. 

So yeah- what’s your reasoning behind splitting up Crossbell and Erebonia like that? I’ve seen some people say that release order is best, which makes sense to me, but your order intrigues me. It’d be nice to not get through one arc too fast, and it’d also allow me to maybe wait a bit and see if Crossbell gets an official English release announcement. I could always take a break and play other Falcom games if it does, although I might not want to wait :P

I appreciate the tip on the spoiler free guide, but to be honest, I’m not going to use one. I want this to continue to be just as absolutely fresh and blind as possible- I think I already missed a single mission in the prologue anyways, unfortunately, but I think that’ll be ok. It’s cool to know that I can carry stuff over though, I look forward to that! Anything that I miss is just incentive to come back and replay again, someday. 

Thank you so much for all of the information, I really appreciate you taking the time to provide it!"
Falcom,fr5ujh1,t1_fr5sjkx,1589914894.0,"My first was VI, and this game just... it brings back so many of those feelings of early FF. It make me feel like a kid playing through FF for the first time which is just such an invaluable experience. I do love IV as well though :P

Thank you for the kind words! I hope to be back again if I have enough to say!"
Falcom,fr5u6kn,t1_fr5niyg,1589914728.0,"Hahaha, thank you for the kind words! There definitely is a lot of reading, so I’m glad to know that long posts are accepted here :P

Honestly, if the “real story” is even half as good as the intro or the buildup, I’m going to be absolutely in love. I really do like this long, slow burn and build- it gets me more attached to everything which is so special."
Falcom,fr5tqz5,t1_fr54eui,1589914522.0,"Well, if this is just world building, I can’t wait to see what the actual “plot” looks like, because I’m blown away and hooked already! I hope that each arc continues to have these long, slow parts because I really feel like it’s helped me so much with my investment. It’d be much harder to get invested if things were fast paced from the beginning, I think, so I hope to experience a lot more of this world building as it goes on. 

Yes, from the bit I’ve seen and heard of Cold Steel, I get the impression that it’s going to be a bit different, tonally. I think that with as invested as I am so far, I’ll be ok with that if only to continue to live in the world and see it evolve. I get the feeling that Sky might be more my thing, slightly, because of the way it reminds me of some of my favorite SNES JRPGs like FFVI or Chrono Trigger. But, one of my favorite newer JRPGs is Persona 4, so I think that I’ll also be fully on board with the more anime, school-type thing. And hearing that it has both school and Sky-style story is honestly really exciting, because if there’s even a chance that I can replicate my old school Final Fantasy love *and* my Persona love... fuck man, this might just be the greatest series ever. 

Also, yes, your point on returning to the school- that does excite me. I’ve always loved games that let me live in one space for the entire thing. I love the feeling of really getting to know a place intimately, so being able to return to one location will be nice. But of course, the bittersweet feeling of leaving a special place behind is also nice in its own way. I think both are great. Honestly, Sky’s regions are small enough, and you spend enough time in each one, that I kind of feel like I’m getting that intimate attachment to each one as I spend time in it. That makes it all the harder to leave. I did hear that SC takes place in the same world though, which I hope is true because I really want to get to revisit everywhere. 

Anyways, yeah, I could probably ramble forever about everything you just said. Thank you for your long and thoughtful post, and for reading my long and meandering one, you’ve only gotten me more excited to continue to play!"
Falcom,fr5si5f,t1_fr5bpap,1589913919.0,"Yeah, I definitely am extremely invested... I have no doubt I’ll be significantly *more* invested by the end, so I am really looking forward to it!

Thank you!"
Falcom,fr5seyl,t1_fr564p8,1589913877.0,Seems to be the consensus! I look forward to seeing where that ride takes me. Thank you!
Falcom,fr5s34m,t1_fr50qn9,1589913717.0,"Oh yes, I am looking forward to being blown away! Like I mentioned to someone else, the slow burn doesn’t bother me too much- honestly, I really like it because of how much it’s allowed me to get attached to the world and the characters. A faster narrative might not allow for that. But I’m also looking forward to when things do blow me away!"
Falcom,fr5riad,t1_fr4x8tr,1589913441.0,"Yeah, I saw that there was a long wait between FC and SC... that must’ve really sucked, but I’m glad you were able to get the chance to play it eventually, and I’m excited to get to it! Thank you for your comment!"
Falcom,fr5rd56,t1_fr4tugb,1589913372.0,"I like how slow it is, really. It’s given me time to feel like I’m really living in this world, and it’s given me time to get emotionally attached to everything and everyone in it. If it was just explosive and fast-paced from the start, I feel that it’d be harder to get as attached as I have. I could honestly play a game that’s this slow paced (if everything about it were *this amazing*) the whole way through, *but*, I’m also extremely excited to see where the story goes and what ends up happening. Honestly just along for the ride- if the writers feel that a moment needs to be slow, I’m good with that- and when it picks up and things start to pay off, I have no doubt they’ll be even more rewarding *because* of the slow burn. 

Thanks for your comment! I am excited to see what you’re hinting at!"
Falcom,fr5qyga,t1_fr4trfy,1589913174.0,"Thank you so much! Glad to know there’s someone else that can relate so much. Yes, I adore Final Fantasy but... they’re not super long games (compared to some other JRPGs), and I always end up getting so sad when they’re over. I just never want to put them down for good. Sometimes that means I replay them endlessly, but some games really don’t lend themselves well to repeat playthroughs. Knowing how many hundreds and hundreds of hours I have ahead of me, and that the series isn’t even over, I’m just so glad that I have so much to get through. I am kind of dreading the end of the Sky arc already, because... I don’t want to leave Estelle and Joshua and Liberl, but I won’t have to leave the *world*, so that alone is comforting enough for me."
Falcom,fr5qjal,t1_fr4thpa,1589912971.0,"Thank you! Yeah, I have no doubt that other people also feel the need to talk about these games as they go through... I mean, it just feels so special and you don’t see much talk about them out in the wild, so coming somewhere like this feels like the best solution to get to gush about it! I’m really thrilled by the incredibly positive and welcoming response too, because I figured this would get sort of buried since, I mean, most people have probably read and/or thought much of this a million times before. 

Yes, every hour has definitely felt so meaningful and each has been better than the last- in every way. Obviously in the plot and character side of things- each hour is a masterclass in how to tell a story economically while also rapidly establishing an attachment between the player and the characters. Seriously, I’ve only played about 25 hours and it feels like I’ve played 100- but I mean that in a really great way, not in a “it’s been boring”. It’s just that *so much has happened* and I feel the level of attachment to everything that might actually take 100 hours to really develop. Also, each hour feels like I am consistently progressing, which is really rewarding too. Every level up feels great, every gear upgrade feels great, every time I flesh out my orbment setup a bit more, it all feels so rewarding. 

I’ve heard nothing but good things about SC so far. To be honest, if it does have some boring parts... I think I’ll be ok with it. Partly because I’m already so invested, but also because I don’t mind things slowing down a bit more. I like the slow burn aspect of the beginning and I will be more than happy to go through it again. 

Thank you for your comment and the kind words!"
Falcom,fr5pngs,t1_fr57xqe,1589912544.0,"Well, that just has me much more excited to see what comes next!

I figured, ehh, there’s some twists I’m spoiling. Like, the orphanage burning down and the culprit- I wouldn’t want that spoiled for me so I’d have to imagine some people a bit behind me would feel the same. 

But, hey! That just sounds like there’s some really excellent stuff ahead that I can’t wait to unravel! Thank you!"
Falcom,fr5pfhg,t1_fr4uu4o,1589912436.0,"Thank you! Yeah, I’m definitely hooked. Like I said above, it’s been a long time since I’ve felt so... utterly compelled to just keep going, to live in that world a bit more, see what happens next. It makes me feel like a kid experiencing the genre for the first time again. And assuming it stays that way (which I think it will), I have no doubt I’ll be in a similar situation to your own last year!

If I have enough to say, I’ll definitely be back again after FC or after SC or whenever it feels appropriate to write some more. Thank you for the kind words!"
Falcom,fr5oz18,t1_fr4pnnq,1589912212.0,"I was really enjoying it from the start but... yeah, somewhere partway through Ruan I just realized how special this game was and how much I’d fallen in love with it. I’m definitely going to continue playing, without a doubt, and depending on how much I have to say, I might be back with another post... we’ll see. Thank you so much for the kind words!"
Falcom,fr5oo38,t1_fr5d5tf,1589912067.0,"I actually bought Cold Steel first. I played... mm, maybe about ten minutes of it, about half a year ago, and then the tutorial felt a bit more than I wanted to do at the time so I put it down. I started thinking about it again recently, but then when I saw a bit of Sky, I think I realized that Sky was maybe a bit more my thing. Sky reminds me so much more of SNES JRPGs, and, let me tell you- I *love* SNES JRPGs. So I’m just really glad I’m playing this game regardless of where it fits in with the overall series, it’s just completely my thing and it fills every desire I have in these kinds of games, and then some. I’m sure Cold Steel would’ve grabbed me if I stuck with it, but I think this game had a better chance of doing so. I kind of have a hard time believing it can get any better than this, to be honest, but I’m excited to see them try :P"
Falcom,fr5o9el,t1_fr4la8o,1589911869.0,"Thank you! Yeah, I mean, each of the areas I’ve had to leave has been tough but Ruan was the hardest by far. I really hope I get to revisit it because it just... it really felt like a perfect little home to me for the 15 or so hours I spent there. It definitely *feels* special, yes- I have no doubt that it’ll continue to become even *more* special as time goes on."
Falcom,fr5o0qs,t1_fr4fnac,1589911753.0,"Thank you, I’m glad you enjoyed it :)

Falcom,fr5ny0k,t1_fr4alsb,1589911715.0,"I really couldn’t help it, yeah. I just needed to share with *someone* because the love I’m feeling towards this game is extremely strong right now. 

Also, yes, definitely to your second point as well! Lots of games try to make you feel like you’re actually on an adventure with people you care about, it’s arguably one of the main tenants of something like a JRPG, and yet so very few of them really fulfill that promise. This one does more than any game I’ve played in *years*, and god is it a special feeling."
Falcom,fr5nkzb,t1_fr4h6u7,1589911538.0,"Yes! Like I said in the OP, knowing that there’s currently eight games out (with the ninth this year and hopefully more in the future) is *so* exciting. I have no doubt that this is just the surface and that my love can only continue to grow. Knowing just how much time I’m going to be able to spend on this world is so exciting and so... honestly just reassuring to me. It means I don’t have to pace myself too much because I just have so much to get through before I have to say goodbye for good!

And yeah, I definitely know the feeling of wishing you could start over fresh. I have several series like that as well and I’ve no doubt that this will be one of them."
Falcom,fr5na8p,t1_fr4i8v3,1589911388.0,"I will (probably) be here to talk at least a bit about it when I’m done!

I’d imagine that much of these opinions will be similar, just maybe more intense, by the time I’m done. I’m excited to see where the rest of it goes!"
Falcom,fr1fput,t3_glo775,1589818930.0,"I wouldn’t generally recommend this, but you could always watch a playthrough of 3rd and Crossbell. I’m in a similar situation, playing through Sky (and it’s a fucking masterpiece so please do play it) on my Vita. I have a computer, but it’s a Mac. I have a partition, but shit’s complicated. Even then, procuring a copy of the Crossbell games and getting a translation patch is *very* complicated. I know people will disagree and maybe I’m dumb, but playing games on PC and doing that kind of stuff is often so much more work than I’m willing to do... *but*, because of how passionate I’ve become about Sky, I fully expect to go through all of it anyways. Assuming that passion lasts through to the end of SC, I plan on figuring out a way to play the games that aren’t easily accessible to me. 

So, my recommendation: *just go ahead and start Sky.* Start playing it. You’ll learn if it’s for you or not. If it isn’t for you, then the Sky trilogy as a whole is out of the question and Crossbell may be as well since it’s similar in gameplay and presentation. You can then give Cold Steel a try- Cold Steel does have summaries of information you need to know in the menus. Summaries for each of the games also exist in both video and text form online. 

If you love Sky and *genuinely* cannot figure out a way to play 3-Crossbell, then you can watch playthroughs on YouTube. I definitely would only recommend this as a last resort, but also I’m the kind of person who doesn’t really love watching those in general. If you are, then that makes this even easier. Playing them is the best option, but if you need the story from these games, in full, and genuinely can’t play the games then this is your best option. Otherwise, again, summaries exist both in the Cold Steel games and online.

Oh, and also, yeah- I know a lot of people started with Cold Steel 1 and 2, then stopped and played the first games, then continued with 3. That seems like a perfectly viable way. I personally am glad I’ve started with Sky because I adore it *so* much, but it does sound like CS1 and 2 are an option if that’s really where you want to start. Just be aware that those games kind of spoil some of the older ones, from what I understand."
Falcom,fqxna4z,t3_gl9c7i,1589734934.0,"Yeah, I know you’ve gotten your answer by this point but just to throw another log on the fire- go ahead and play it, but take your time and don’t feel compelled to rush. 

Play naturally. That’s the most important thing. Play naturally. Play it how you think the characters might go about doing things. Chances are, if this happened in real life, they would be doing jobs (they’d need money for food and lodging), so you can do as many side quests as you feel comfortable doing. They might get to know people in the towns they visit- maybe they’d want to check in on their friends every now and then and see what they’re doing. 

In other words, if something feels natural and/or compelling, go along with it. I do recommend checking in on NPCs as much as you can, it is a good time and they do have great stories to tell. But, of course, running around each city after every story event... that’s a lot. That’s going to make each game take a hundred hours. You don’t have to do that. You can, of course, but you don’t have to do that. Pick a handful of people in each town that interest you and follow their stories. Pick maybe one city or village and really stick to learning the intricacies of that one place. 

See, one of the coolest things about this game is the way that seeds are planted early on that grow into full-fledged storylines. Like, for instance, you may hear a woman talking about how much she wants her son to go to a certain school, only to later find out that the dad has different ideas and the songs has different plans still- and then that story unfolds and resolves. That’s a really small early example (don’t want to spoil anything), but it is just so freaking cool to see it happen. 

I can’t in good faith recommend you skip all of it. But I also think only the maddest of mad men will play the *whole* game while talking to *every* NPC. Talk to them. Experience the world and the story. Do whatever you feel most comfortable doing. If you get bored of a city, that’s ok. If you lose interest in the NPCs, that’s ok. But at least give them a try and talk to the ones you can along the way. If you come to care about any of them, definitely stick to them and learn what stories they have to tell. It pays off."
JRPG,fqultaa,t3_gkonk8,1589660966.0,"My first true love in games was JRPGs. I found Final Fantasy as a kid and I fell head over heels in love with it, and that stuck around for a long time... until I got older and more “mindless” games started filling up my playtime. My backlog grew, and yet I continued to play mindless games that didn’t really leave me feeling much emotion or satisfaction. Games like Assassin’s Creed, Call of Duty, Destiny, to name a handful. I realized just how far I fell from what made me truly happy when Persona 5 came out and I never finished it, because it just didn’t grab me when compared to other games like the ones I mentioned above. 

This being said, I recently found my passion for JRPGs again. FF7R was coming out, and I wanted to go back and get the platinum trophy on the FF7 PS4 port, so I committed to it and... you know what? I had a better time with that game than I have had with *most* games I’ve played in the past several years. Persona 5 Royal came out, I dove into that, and I found that I actually *could* love that game even though I thought I couldn’t. FF7R came out and that game makes me so emotional that I don’t always have the capacity to play it- but that’s an amazing thing because it’s such a special game to me. I’ve committed to finishing AI The Somnium Files (not a JRPG, but there’s definite crossover), a game I was super hyped for last year but couldn’t finish- I’m in the second half of that game and it’s one of my favorite stories I’ve ever experienced in a game. 

And now... now I’m playing Trails in the Sky, and I have not been *this* engaged with a game in a very long time. I absolutely adore it, so much more than I ever thought I could enjoy a game as an adult. It might end up being one of my favorite games of all time if it holds this level of quality to the end. 

I bring this up because I want to sort of corroborate what I’m seeing some other people say: focus on a game. Really *try* to focus. It’s hard. I know it is. I have that struggle sometimes where a JRPG is just... too much. It requires a lot of focus, a lot of attention. You have so many numbers to pay attention to, so many terms to learn, so many characters and plot details to remember, so much optional content that it gets overwhelming... it’s a lot. Playing one of these games is a lot. 

But you know what? It’s so fucking worth it. Play thirty minutes every day if you can. Add more time as you feel able. Most JRPGs tend to get better and better as they go along, so you might need to really do a lot of work to get to the “good” parts, but it’s only a “good” part by comparison with other fiction. A JRPG’s goal is to be a slow burn that sucks you in. What should happen is that you find that, through the large amounts of time you spend with characters, in a world, doing relatively unimportant things, you start to build a powerful emotional connection to the world and everything (and everyone) in it. Then, when something big and exciting happens, you really *feel* it, because you’ve gotten so attached to everything. A major plot twist, character death, cataclysmic event, action set piece, showdown, whatever the case may be- these things often happen in other stories, but maybe without so much buildup. If a main character dies 90 minutes into a 2 hour movie, it might hit you hard, but at the end of the day you’ve only known that character for 90 minutes. If a main character dies 90 hours into a 100 hour game, well, suddenly that’s 90 hours of buildup to that moment and you’d better believe your attachment is so much deeper than it could have been without those 90 hours. 

Other works of fiction have sort of conditioned us to believe that those big moments are the good parts, the parts that make media worth consuming, but a JRPG knows that the buildup to those moments is at least as important as the moments themselves- if not more important. You really have to do some hard work to reframe your thoughts to accept this and just let the slow burn slowly pull you in. These games tend to be long as hell, so if you’re not hooked in the first... hour, two hours, hell, even twenty hours- that’s so totally ok. You don’t have to be. If there’s anything there that encourages you to continue your journey, continue it- it’s *probably* going to pay off in the end. 

So, my point here: it’s worth it. It’s hard, I know, JRPGs are a big commitment and they might even become exhausting, but... but they’re so worth it. I just can’t express that enough. I fully agree with the other commenter: playing these games can almost be meditative. Despite how much they might demand of you, they are slow paced and relaxing, and this allows your mind to just... calmly wander and take it all in. You don’t need to worry about reaction time, you’re not (normally) getting bombarded with loads of different systems or bits of information. You’re just there, walking around, fighting dudes, leveling up, spending time with characters and listening to music. It might take a lot of mental energy to pick it up initially (especially if you take an extended break, so I advise against that), but once you get your bearings at the start of each session, it’s quite likely that you’ll just get lost in the world- in a good way. 

More to the point of practical advice, real quick:

Pick one that’s appealing to you. I can highly recommend everything I listed above (right now I’m kind of so overwhelmingly in love with Trails in the Sky that it’s my strongest recommendation), but if none of those appeal to you, that’s totally fine- find something that does. Don’t research too much lest you get spoiled, but find some music, find a bit of gameplay, look at some of the environments and think “Is this a world that would suck me in? Would I enjoy spending 50+ hours listening to this music and walking around these places?”

Play every day, or almost every day. It doesn’t have to be for a long period, but you should do this so that you don’t forget what you were doing last and lose your momentum (this makes it hard to come back), but also so you can just get into the habit of focusing on one thing. 

If you settle on a game, don’t buy anything new. Commit to finishing it. It might be a bit much for you to just play that one game exclusively, so maybe allow yourself to play something more mindless too (a multiplayer shooter or something), but remember that your priority is your JRPG. Buying new things or hopping between multiple games is a recipe for information overload, choice paralysis, and stress. It gets to be too much and then the only thing you’ll want to do is whatever feels easiest. 

Don’t force yourself to do anything you don’t truly want to do. If a side quest feels too grindy or stressful, skip it. If you don’t want to grind for the endgame bosses, don’t. If you don’t want to talk to everyone or collect all the items or hit max level or unlock each character’s most powerful weapons and spells, don’t do it. Play naturally. Do what you think the characters would want to do first, and if you then feel compelled to do more outside of that, do it. Otherwise, it’s ok to skip things. 

When it comes to choosing a game, you have one of two ways of doing this: dive into the deep end, or immerse yourself slowly. I can’t recommend one over the other, it’s just your personality. Diving into the deep end would be starting an all-time great, although one that is maybe not very accessible to non-fans of the genre. We’re talking an older game (like a SNES/PS1 JRPG, Final Fantasy VI, Chrono Trigger, Xenogears, etc.) or a more niche one overall like maybe a Disgaea. 

The slower approach would mean looking at the newer, more Westernized, more accessible options. If you like Witcher 3 style games, Final Fantasy XV. Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a phenomenal game with a lot of mainstream appeal, and it’s less than 40 hours so it’s not a major commitment. Persona 5 is basically *the* game to bridge the gap between mainstream and niche when it comes to JRPGs, I’d really highly recommend that one if you’re trying to get into the genre- just be warned that it’s long as *fuck*. Dragon Quest XI sits pretty comfortably between the two in length, and is about as accessible as both- lots of nice modern quality of life features, although I honestly don’t enjoy it as much as either one personally. Whichever way you choose to go, just make sure it’s a game that is exciting to you, and make sure you focus on it. A shorter game might be the easiest starting point so you can just experience how it feels to finish a JRPG- it’s a great feeling. 

Find something you can be passionate about. Find people to talk to about those things. And then focus, commit, and enjoy it. It’s well worth the effort. At the end of the day, it may come to pass that JRPGs just aren’t your thing. That’s ok too. No one thing is for everyone, so don’t force yourself to play something you don’t enjoy- but also just keep an eye out for things that might be an exception to that rule. A new game on the horizon or some hidden gem you’ve never heard of could absolutely become your next favorite and suck you into the genre as a whole. 

Best of luck to you, and if you have any questions on anything above, feel free to ask! Hope you find *your* game!"

Love your idea and have wanted this, or even more than this, for many years now. If it happens I’m going to be extremely excited. If it doesn’t, ehh, I’m sure it’ll still be fun to stab dudes in the face."
assassinscreed,fqcye0g,t3_gi0rp4,1589273212.0,"The Truth segments are my favorite parts of the series and always have been- seeing them disappear from Revelations onward broke my heart in a way you can’t even imagine. There was something so... special about slowly piecing together a conspiracy throughout thousands of years, jumping from historical event to historical event, casting this weird alternate conspiracy theory history over events everyone knows about, all the while slowly piecing together... something, some weird video that would leave you with a massive cliffhanger. And truth be told, it hurts that a lot of that seems to have been just forgotten or ignored. 

I loved the aesthetics and concept of the Animus. I loved the idea that hey, maybe it isn’t healthy for you to spend much time in it lest you develop DID or something similar and start scrawling messages on the walls of your prison cell in blood. I *loved* the way the Abstergo office looked. I *loved* that 1, 2, and Brotherhood each had some crazy earth shattering plot twist towards the end, with each one slowly ramping up and expanding the scope of the narrative beyond what you’d thought you were getting. I loved the promise of building up some badass protagonist who would finish the fight that started with Altair. Desmond sucked, he wasn’t a great character, but I think he was meant to be an unlikable little twerp at the start- at the end of AC2, there’s this (ultimately unfulfilled) promise that he’d become something better than that. That he could develop his skills and actually become a suitable leader to actually finish off Abstergo and end it all. 

And of course, Ubisoft not having the balls to follow through on any of this broke my heart so goddamn much. I said, from the first time I played AC1, that I wanted a game set entirely in the modern day. When the series honestly looked to be building towards that, what with the Mayan apocalypse looming (and it was so fucking cool that 3 aligned with that date) and the threat of some massive World War 3 level event, I had such high hopes for the whole thing to come together in an amazing, cohesive, satisfying way. 

Needless to say, I was disappointed. But, I’ve seen some elements of this maybe start to come back. Playing Odyssey, seeing its true ending and reading everything on Layla’s computer, it honestly did make me feel the way that 2 and Brotherhood made me feel... a lesser version of that, but the same basic thing. And *that* was truly special. So I’m starting to maybe get a bit of hope back. I just hope I don’t get my heart stepped on like I did after Revelations and 3. I’m trying not to get too invested but when I’m starting to see these ingredients being laid out in front of me, I’m starting to salivate at the prospect of them *finally* being combined into the feast I feel we never got. 

Of course, I also think this feast can’t ever happen until the series finale, we need a final game, one that isn’t left open for sequels. Spin-offs are one thing, sequels are another though and the constant “we can’t ruin anything for the next set of writers and developers who need to make the next game” is a big part of what I think killed this series for me. But yeah- seeing a bit of life being breathed back into it has me cautiously optimistic."
PS4,fq36miy,t1_fpw3ucq,1589063494.0,"Jesus Christ, have you seen *any* early gen PS3 games? Or are you twelve years old? This looks *nothing* like a PS3 game, I legitimately hate it when people spout this garbage. It’s not a AAA, TLOU2 quality game (in terms of fidelity) but it’s a *hell* of a lot better looking than any PS3 game. Looks better than [Resistance](https://youtu.be/_101tZJVsf4), [COD 3](https://youtu.be/6qnvSJtycIA), even [Uncharted](https://youtu.be/Dde_J6hgi-E) or [GTA 4](https://youtu.be/x9V-gPYAT1I).

Not that this even matters, graphics don’t matter at all in terms of what makes a “good” game. If this has a good story and good gameplay, then it could look like a fucking PS1 game for all I care. Considering the pedigree behind the writers and the insane quality of the first game, as well as the fact that they’ve had all the time they need to make this, I’ve nothing but confidence in this one."
PS4,fq32wo6,t1_fq22soc,1589062510.0,"The PS2 to PS3 “leap” wasn’t really *that* huge- I think people really undervalue how great PS2 games looked and really overvalue PS3 graphics. The big leap was in HD, absolutely, that revolutionized the way games look, although I’d argue that outside of that, in terms of textures, models, frame rate, effects, most aspects of fidelity outside of resolution, the PS3 was not a huge jump forward- in fact, it was a bit of a step back in some areas. Namely in frame rate- so many more games ran at 60 FPS on the PS2 generation, and the PS3 generation onwards has loads of games that struggle to hit 30. 

But anyways, just for some examples.

Look at some upscaled gameplay of PS2 games like: [Final Fantasy XII](https://youtu.be/e5Wksb41iFk), [Metal Gear Solid 3](https://youtu.be/_GU3cQ3QdmM), [Ratchet and Clank](https://youtu.be/oLAHM_2rKbg), [Gran Turismo 3](https://youtu.be/W7h6dOG8Xmg), or [God of War 2](https://youtu.be/6gTqZ9K4rAM). 

Then compare that to some launch title PS3 games like: [Resistance](https://youtu.be/_101tZJVsf4), [COD3](https://youtu.be/6qnvSJtycIA), [Oblivion](https://youtu.be/aeLkpdfBcWM), or [Need for Speed Carbon](https://youtu.be/z0xQ4qROXgI). 

Is there a leap in quality? Absolutely, no denying it. However, it is *not* a monumental leap. 

Thing about PS2->PS3, PS2->PS4, and presumably PS4->PS5 is that early launch titles (such as the ones we are currently seeing) simply are **not** a major step up in quality. Late gen PS3 games *absolutely* are a major step up from PS2. Last of Us is an incredibly gorgeous game that blows PS2 games out of the water, without a doubt- but that game came out at the very end of the console generation, after Naughty Dog made *three* other games to start getting acquainted with the system. Uncharted 1 looks only moderately better than a PS2 game, and that game isn’t even a launch title.

Every time a new generation comes around, people are always disappointed. PS4 launch titles didn’t look great either. Black Flag wasn’t impressive, Killzone Shadow Fall wasn’t impressive, COD Ghosts wasn’t impressive, these games look great and they’re better than most PS3 games visually but... not by a *huge* stretch. But now here at the tail end of PS4, we’re getting games like Death Stranding, God of War, TLOU2, Red Dead Redemption 2, to name a few, and these games *do* look unbelievable and they *are* an incredible leap up from PS3. 

Point is, no, we shouldn’t be blown away by what we’ve seen so far but things *always get better*, and we often have our nostalgia glasses on when looking back at older games. In terms of fidelity, the two biggest generational leaps from after when Nintendo made gaming modern and relevant were NES->SNES (8-bit to 16-bit) and PS1->PS2 (3D actually working in a decent way). Most other generational leaps are moderate at the start and ramp up in the second half. 

Next generation is going to blow our minds but it probably won’t be as big of a leap as PS1->PS2, it’ll be about the same as PS2->PS3 or PS3->PS4. 

And then by the end of next generation, we’re going to hear people questioning if anything can ever be as impressive as the PS3->PS4 leap because nostalgia clouds judgment and memory."
PS4Deals,fpws9do,t1_fpwn07w,1588969038.0,"I’ll tell you for me personally, it was just Disney that ruined it. When KH first started, I got into it because I liked Final Fantasy and I thought it was *really* cool to see characters from different FF games in the same game. Additionally, the Disney stuff that was in those games was generally stuff that I’d enjoyed as a kid- Aladdin, Hercules, Mulan, Tarzan, to name a few. I liked those movies and while I never really liked any of them *more* than Final Fantasy, I did enjoy them. Square also had a lot of creative freedom over those games. Sometimes they’d be straight retellings of the movies but sometimes they’d be more unique stories, and regardless of what story each world told, there’d always be weird Kingdom Hearts shit going on there too. 

KH3 has *no* Final Fantasy characters or content at all (at least in the vanilla game, I think they turn up in the expansion) besides one or two meaningless references. I personally didn’t like many of the choices of the worlds. I liked Hercules and Toy Story was pretty cool but... that’s kind of it for me. I genuinely dislike Frozen and Tangled, and playing through those worlds was an absolute slog. Worst of all, you can very obviously feel the increased Disney presence throughout the entire game, [which the developers discuss partially in this interview](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/11/kingdom-hearts-3-the-challenges-and-rewards-of-working-with-disney). It felt so painfully obvious that Disney were making a lot of demands and requiring a lot of say in what was in the game and how it was portrayed. Like, in the Frozen world, they *literally sing the entirety of Let it Go*, and it’s... kinda painful, to be honest, since everyone in the world has heard that song about five million times more than they’d ever want to have heard it. 

When things are allowed to be as Kingdom Hearts as they can be, I enjoyed it more. But like 80% of that game is just meaningless Disney theme park exploration, heavily curated by the powers that be, and it was just a massive disappointment as a major Square Enix fan. 

Of course, if you don’t care about Final Fantasy or if you don’t have an emotional attachment to the original KH games, it probably won’t let you down as much. If you’re a Disney fan who just wants to explore Disney worlds, you’re going to have a good time with it. It’s fun, it’s flashy, it’s stunningly beautiful, it plays well, the pacing is great, the character progression is solid, it’s good stuff outside of the Final Fantasy/Kingdom Hearts complaints, but it was just so far removed from what I’d wanted it to be."
ZeroEscape,fpwn2j3,t3_getjkk,1588966349.0,"It kinda sounds like you’re playing with a guide which is disheartening. The “best” way to play, and the way I highly recommend you play the next two games if you do, is to just do it naturally. Play normally. Choose whatever feels right to you, whatever feels best, in the moment. Live with whatever ending you get. The way these games work, you’re meant to see *all* the endings, so order doesn’t matter. 

But, just for your current situation, do true ending last. Always do true ending last."
NoStupidQuestions,fp6k82j,t1_fp6ifsa,1588353762.0,"I’m focused on not comparing two people or two illnesses. Sure, if someone was a risk to themselves or others, they need to be aware of the severity of the situation, I never said anything to the contrary. 

I’d also say, however, that it should be discussed in a productive way. You don’t just say “You’re suicidal, it’s really severe, and because of this you might kill yourself” or “you have bipolar and therefore if your manic episodes get intense enough, it might trigger psychosis”. This just isn’t something that you want to put into someone’s head. 

Instead, I’d think it’d be better to frame it from a treatment perspective. “I think that you should look into this type of treatment for what you’re describing right now”. That treatment could be anything from therapy to medication to hospitalization, with obviously each being more intensive than the last, indicating the severity level while not outright stating it. 

Again, it’s all about avoiding qualitative assessments as much as you can. If you can avoid it, you shouldn’t say “your condition is severe”, you should use the constructive sentence of “here’s what you’re dealing with, here’s how you fix it”. If someone is prone to psychotic breaks, you don’t say “You might have a psychotic break”, you say “Here are some potential triggers to avoid and some treatment paths to follow so you don’t repeat an episode like the ones you’ve had before”. 

This is really just a part of the overall language of CBT, the sort of reframing overly emotional or qualitative statements into straightforward, logical, constructive ones. 

And again, note, even when addressing the severity of the situation directly, you *never* want to compare two illnesses or two people to each other, at least not to their faces. Finally, since this is all online anyways, even if we were all therapists or psychiatrists, diagnosing or evaluating people is totally out of the question. The best we can do for each other is just recommend that someone goes to a professional."
NoStupidQuestions,fp6hwl6,t1_fp6fsho,1588352628.0,"Absolutely, and this is a point which I alluded to in my post. Some illnesses require more intensive treatment than others, absolutely, and some put people at a greater risk to themselves and others. 

However, you’d never tell someone who’s suffering from a mental illness how “severe” theirs is in comparison to someone else, nor will you vocally rank the severity. Generally speaking, a psychiatrist should avoid placing any qualitative judgments on any patient or the illness they’re experiencing. Hell, a psychiatrist really should know not to engage in that type of thinking *at all* in their profession- it’s not part of their job. 

A psychiatrist’s job is to handle all of that on their end and determine the most appropriate course of action based on the patient’s needs. A bit of comparison is likely inevitable, but unless you’re studying something specific or trying to make a specific point to your colleagues, it really just is not helpful in any way to start qualitatively rating your patient’s severity. What is helpful is to just look at the symptoms, look at how those symptoms impact that individual person’s emotional state, look at how those symptoms impact that person’s life, and work to treat the person based on what you’ve observed and heard. This does not involve comparing illnesses nor does it involve telling the patient if their situation is better or worse than someone else’s. 

Again: it’s important to avoid minimizing their feelings by telling them they don’t have it that bad, and to avoid scaring them into feeling like they’re worse off than other people."
NoStupidQuestions,fp58mrn,t1_fp51yo4,1588320144.0,"Hard disagree with what you said, the way you said this, and its implication. 

First of all, it’s not “probably” anything. Even if you’re a psychiatrist or a psychologist (which I doubt, because you’d know what I’m about to say if you were), you wouldn’t be able to give even a “probable” diagnosis over the internet based off of a single sentence. If you were a psychiatrist or psychologist, you would know that the responsible and proper response to this is “go see a professional”. 

Second, it’s really unhealthy and unnecessary to rate the severity of mental illness, *especially* when you don’t know for certain what someone does or doesn’t have. 

Here’s the thing: if you’re looking in on two people from the outside while being entirely objective and unbiased, you might be able to determine which illness is worse. Like, if you have someone with mild ADD vs. someone with severe psychosis brought on by schizophrenia, yeah, you can pretty clearly make a determination as to which person needs more help. 

That being said, you **never** compare one mentally ill person to another, at least not to their faces (things are a bit different in certain academic situations). This is dangerous and entirely unhelpful. You don’t want someone to feel like they’re *worse off* than someone else, nor do you want them to feel like their problems are unimportant or *minimized* if their illness isn’t as serious as someone else’s. 

Additionally, each person’s personal experience is subjective and uniquely theirs. Yes, on the outside, you can make a decent evaluation on who has it worse, if you aren’t either of the people in question. However, you can’t do that for yourself and nor can anyone else do it for themselves. Someone with mild anxiety might honestly feel just as bad, if not worse, than someone with, say, bipolar during a manic episode. One person’s illness is more severe, sure, but since the manic person likely feels on top of the world, the anxious person is probably having a far worse subjective experience, although since you can’t know that for sure since you can’t experience both people’s feelings, it’s probably best to just not even try to compare. 

One further point: a statement like yours is so vague. What scale are you using to determine which illness is worse? How do you have the right to do so? What metric can possibly make this a reasonable statement to even attempt to make? I’m not saying you’re necessarily wrong, merely that I’m not thinking that your statement makes any sense at all. It’s like saying that my TV is more like a TV than your TV, like, what does this statement even mean, how is this decided, and what does it accomplish?

Because of this, dissociation without depression is not “probably” worse than dissociation *with* depression. It isn’t better or worse at all. Let’s try to avoid these qualitative statements when discussing mental illness, because all it does is make people second guess themselves and add extra pressure and difficulty to an already difficult situation."
AFireInside,fp47ncq,t1_fp1sje1,1588293321.0,"I’d heard most of these before but not the Never Let Me Down Again. I fucking love that song and they *killed* it! I had no idea this existed but I’m so glad you linked it here, thank you!"
nier,fojzxaa,t3_g7tefp,1587832746.0,"I’d honestly recommend you do start with Automata. It’s the most polished, up to date, accessible game in the series by a large margin. I think going back and starting with Nier or Drakengard 3 might turn you off (or at least it would for some people) because those games aren’t the most fun things in the world. They have their issues when it comes to the gameplay, they were honestly pretty aged when they came out- especially Nier. 

However, Automata is, I think, just a really fucking fun action game on top of its story, meaning that the gameplay can hook you first. That’ll pull you through the game, then the story will get its claws in you, then you’ll become passionate about the world and the characters, then you’ll want to go back and play the others. By that point, you’ll have enough of an attachment that playing those older games won’t be as much of a pain.

After you play the older ones, you can go back to Automata and pick up on everything you missed. You’ll know everything from the older games so you’ll catch all of the Easter eggs, and you’ll also know all of the spoilers for Automata so you can start to pick up on all of the foreshadowing and building up to those twists."
nier,fojy54s,t1_fojbwcu,1587831744.0,"It’s not impossible. [According to this timeline,](http://www.nier2.com/timeline.html) Father Nier’s story happens in 3361 where Brother Nier’s happens in 3465. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/66mre2/can_you_explain_nier_gestalt_vs_replicant/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) is an older Reddit post where someone kindly explains and links some sources that go into more information on the matter. Yoko Taro has explicitly stated, at least once, that both events happened. He states that the events of the games happen on repeat, with Nier and Yonah sometimes being father and daughter, sometimes being brother and sister. One merely needs to play the first ten seconds of Automata (“Everything that lives is designed to end... trapped in a never ending cycle of life and death”, etc.) to understand how important this concept of cycles is to these games. The cycle was only broken in Brother Nier’s story when ending D occurs. 

Now- all endings and all stories are canon, across all the games, according to Drakengard 3. That game goes into parallel timelines and alternate realities and such, which explains how, say, each ending for each of the four Yoko Taro games are “canon” in this sense. Ending D did happen for Papa Nier, and Ending C did happen for Brother Nier- they just happened in different timelines/universes, and neither of these happened in the Automata universe as far as we know. 

When talking about the timeline which leads to Automata, there’s only one to discuss: the one I linked you above, which has Gestalt and Replicant happening 100 years apart, and which has Ending D for Brother Nier happening the latest of the Nier 1 events. 

More evidence is in [this weapon story](https://nierautomata.wiki.fextralife.com/Virtuous+Dignity), which references Brother Nier, and [this weapon story](https://nierautomata.wiki.fextralife.com/Cruel+Arrogance) which references Father NieR. 

I could keep going for a while but this is probably enough for now."
politics,foecdak,t1_fodfvr9,1587700473.0,"I take issue with your first reference and how you framed it. 

You didn’t lie, but you did fail to mention a vital fact: correlation is *not* causation. The findings of that study were not “Hydrochloroquine is dangerous”, they were “no effects were found”. In other words: Hydrochloroquine did not *necessarily cause* the higher death rate. 

Let’s say I have two hundred plants, roughly 20% of them are in poor shape, 60% are in average shape, and 20% are in amazing shape. Let’s then say that I plant these plants, and track their growth. One hundred of the plants receive water and fertilizer. One hundred just receive water. The ones which receive fertilizer are my variable group, and the plants were randomly assigned to each group. I then proceed to measure the rate of growth of each of the plants over the course of say, two weeks. I then report my findings, and what I find was that the fertilizer did not help- actually, the plants which didn’t receive fertilizer grew a bit faster on average. 

The conclusion there is *not* “this fertilizer hurts plants”. The conclusion is “this one specific study shows that the fertilizer didn’t have any major benefits”. Not only is more data needed, but in fact, we can poke holes in several points of this study. First of all, what if, hypothetically, more of the already healthy plants ended up in the control group? What if the variable group had a lot of the ones in poor shape? What if the method of distributing the fertilizer was off? What if there was just some unforeseen circumstance which impacted the results of my study? If there were, say, nine studies done prior to this one which showed a benefit of using this fertilizer, then this tenth one does not necessarily disprove the others. Instead, we should say “ok, this was one set of results, let’s look for even more”. We shouldn’t freak out and start screaming that the fertilizer is dangerous. 

Another, dumber, purely hypothetical example. I study one hundred neighborhoods. I find that within those neighborhoods, people who live in white houses are more likely to own black cars. What does this prove? Am I meant to assume that white houses make people buy black cars? Am I meant to assume that people who gravitate towards white houses also gravitate towards black cars? No, of course not- I’m meant to assume that this is just a weird statistic I see and that much more data is needed to make any actual conclusion. Data like interviewing home owners, looking at historical information to determine which came first, studying more houses, studying how common white houses and black cars are in general, etc. 

Hydrochloroquine has been shown, in other studies, to be effective especially if given early in a patient’s treatment. Is it a miracle drug? No. Is it deadly? Absolutely not. 

We have to be so very careful not to do the exact same shit that they do when they criticize people who oppose Trump. Trump makes a rash claim based off of seeing a few studies and seeing some reports on Fox? Cool, let him do that- he’s a total idiot for it and we shouldn’t listen or trust him. We, on the other hand, need to look at **all of the data** and not just immediately jump to a conclusion when one single study proves him wrong. There are a lot of questions to be answered regarding Hydrochloroquine and this study does *not* answer all of them. It gives us *one* set of contrasting data, data which contrasts to several other studies and statistics that show that the drug may be helpful in some cases. That’s it.

The rest of your points or your overall conclusion I don’t take issue with. I don’t know enough about everything else he’s said to argue with them. Even if everything else he said was right (which I highly doubt it was) *you shouldn’t take medical advice from him anyways,* **because he’s not a doctor.**"
PS4,fodix0m,t1_fod66nu,1587685260.0,"This is absurd and you’re wrong. 

First of all, each team has a certain upper capacity of people that it can hold before each new member starts to actively *hurt* the process. Simply throwing more manpower on a job is not the solution to a problem, these battles aren’t won by numbers, but rather by educated, specialized people doing what they do best. 

Second, bug squishing is an incredibly complex situation. It’s not as easy as “identify bug and fix it”. Sometimes changing one thing causes other things to break, and then you have to go fix those other things and suddenly there’s a chain reaction of a mess that makes everything fall apart. Once again: these messes aren’t cleaned up by just throwing more people on it. 

Imagine I spill my bowl of cereal on the ground. If I clean it up myself, it takes me, say, a minute to run and get all the supplies I need, clean it up, and dispose of the trash. If I get two more people helping, maybe we can do it a lot faster- someone throws me my supplies, I clean it up, I throw the trash to someone else, maybe we shave off twenty to thirty seconds. Now imagine I get thirty people all in that room trying to help. It’s going to end up taking *longer* to clean up that mess. Now I have twenty nine other people to boss around, everyone is shuffling around my kitchen, going through my cabinets, getting on their hands and knees to clean up, people are stepping on and tripping over each other... it’s a clusterfuck, and at the end of it all, it would have been so, so, *so* much easier to just do it myself or with a small group. 

Working in a team in a work environment is like this but times a thousand. The larger the team gets, the harder it is to manage each member. The larger it is, the less the team can effectively communicate with each other. The larger it is, the more that work is being done without everyone else being on the same page. The list of complications go on and on and on, ad infinitum, until eventually everything just gets overly complicated and it falls to pieces. 

Hiring more people is rarely the solution, at least, once your team reaches the absolutely *massive* size of one like DICE. 

The other person was right. The art teams have no bearing on the programmers. In fact, since concept art can exist in isolation, it’s *more logical* to hire more concept artists than more programmers. Each of those concert artists can have something to do, and they never have to worry about fucking up the game overall. If one of them sketches on a notepad, it’s not going to break the game. If a programmer makes a mistake, or even if they just change something that shouldn’t be changed, that can cause more work for everyone. 

Artists working on character models, those evil, dirty communists who have this cruel and sadistic notion that they should undermine your fragile masculinity by *making a female character model* (the *fucking* audacity) are, believe it or not, not responsible for ruining your video game. Nor are the executives who hired them."

PS4,fnfx605,t1_fnfvq45,1586917371.0,"I also love FF12 but it is a very unique and very different game in the franchise, hence the “weird” label. The gameplay is nothing like any of the others and the story and setting are extremely unique. In fairness, there are other games in the series where the same could be said, like VIII for instance. I just wouldn’t recommend it for a newcomer in 2020. I’d have recommended it for a newcomer when it came out, but I think there are better places to start these days on PS4. I think the jobs and gambit systems in the Zodiac Age will also be extremely difficult for newcomers to wrap their heads around as well. 

Definitely wasn’t trying to say anything bad about it, I love all Final Fantasy games to death, it’s tied with Metal Gear as being my favorite series so I certainly wasn’t trying to say it isn’t good or worth playing. I personally just wouldn’t advise someone new to start there."

So, if it’s a new numbered game, you do *not* have to have played any games before it. 

Things do get a bit complicated with spinoffs and sub series, although you don’t really need to worry/know about that as a new fan. Just know that there are way more than 15 FF games, and some of those are connected to other games. Like, Final Fantasy X, which is on PS4, got a direct sequel called FF X-2- read aloud as “”FF Ten Two”, as in, the sequel to Ten, the second Ten. You don’t really have to worry about that though, as someone who’s new. 

You can, therefore, start with literally any of the games. I’ll give some recommendations of the ones on PS4. 7 Remake is unbelievably amazing so far and, since it’s the newest one, it’s a pretty great entry point. If you like games like The Witcher 3 or the newer Assassin’s Creed games, FFXV follows a similar formula and is very accessible. XIV is incredible, the best MMO I’ve ever played (and the best FF since X for my money), so it’s worth checking out if you are interested in MMOs. If you want a more traditional FF experience, X is an excellent choice, with its classic turn based combat. VII, VIII, and IX are all PS1 games and are all available on PS4- if you want an older game, check whichever one out here that has the most appealing setting to you (VIII is my favorite of these three). XII is also on PS4 but it’s a bit of a weird one and unless you really love the setting, I recommend holding off on it for a bit. 

Anyways, not the person you asked so sorry for butting in, but if you have any other questions feel free to ask!"
PS4,fmquxlk,t1_fmpnz8l,1586307601.0,"I felt similarly about Destiny for a long time until I realized what the light level system really is. Your LL is entirely irrelevant to almost everything, you’re right. That system basically just functions as a gateway to higher level content, and that’s it. It’s to give you something to work towards so that you can access a new activity. An expansion drops, the light level cap increases, a new raid comes out close to that cap, and everyone needs to grind to hit that threshold for entry to the raid. 

All combat in Destiny is percentage based, the raw numbers are almost entirely irrelevant. Say you’re level 750 and you’re fighting level 750 enemies. You have an SMG that takes away 10% of an enemy’s health bar per shot. When you’re level 1000 fighting level 1000 enemies, that same SMG is still going to take away 10% of the enemy’s health bar. This isn’t a JRPG or something where you can grind to become substantially more powerful than your enemies (although even when you’re at max level, there’s still some content that’s hundreds of levels lower than you and the power difference genuinely *is* noticeable, it’s just this doesn’t happen often). Because this is an online game, everything has to be balanced and scaled appropriately 

And for Destiny, this is *how it should be*. At its core, the gameplay of Destiny is first person shooting. It’s an action game. Player skill *matters*. This solves a major issue in other action-RPGs: if you grind enough, it doesn’t matter how good you are. In a game like Diablo or The Division or Borderlands or the new Assassin’s Creed games or a JRPG, you name it, the numbers are the be all, end all. Strategy and skill only comes into play if you’re playing at or above your level, and since you can always just go grind for hours, you never have to have that challenge if you don’t want to have it. Destiny never has this problem because it all scales, because light level is irrelevant, and therefore your player skill *always* matters and the action *always* feels fun since you can’t just get through all of the activities killing everything in one shot. 

Farming or grinding for new gear is therefore crucial for other reasons. Getting exotic gear provides unique and powerful mechanics that enhance your build. You also have rolls you want to obtain for your weapons and armor- you might want the best possible version of a gun you like, and you therefore farm for it until you have it. You may want to make a specific build and therefore you want to farm for armor with stats which contribute towards that build. Getting special weapons helps with certain encounters, some weapons/loadouts are very important in higher level content. Hell, you may even just enjoy collecting and want to collect all the things. There’s many reasons to do this stuff which goes beyond just the light level of the gear you’re getting. 

Don’t get me wrong, Destiny has... literally hundreds of other issues worth criticizing, I don’t play it much anymore because of those issues, but I do think the light level mechanics are fantastic, you just have to adjust your thinking to be on the wavelength of the game. Light level is just a way to give you a clearly defined goal and lock you out of content until you’re “ready”- and, cosmetically, to show off how much you’ve played the game."
PS4,fmqjlcu,t1_fmq4yrf,1586300884.0,"Conversion rates. Your dollar isn’t the same everywhere. 

If it’s $80 where you are (presumably Canada or Australia), you’re actually getting it cheaper than the US does if the game sells at $60 (as is the MSRP for a new game in the US, this $50 is a Wal-Mart exception). $80 in Canada is $57.11 USD as of today, and $80 in Australia is $49.34 USD as of today."
PS4,fmg84bc,t1_fmelog5,1586043265.0,"The other person already answered, but to go into more detail- 0 is the definite answer. It was made with newcomers in mind. Chronologically it’s the first game in the series, although it was the sixth main release.

After 0, things get weird for a bit. Yakuza 1 and 2 are both PS2 games originally, and the developers chose to remake those games from the ground up in modern engines after 0. These games are called Kiwami and Kiwami 2, respectively. 

The really cool thing about these games that I feel people forget or ignore is that they were intentionally made not only as remakes of the originals, but also as *sequels* to 0. 0 came before them, and the developers intended for people to play Kiwami 1 and 2 after playing 0. 

There’s a lot of additional content and changes in the Kiwami remakes when contrasted with the originals. These changes sometimes end up tying directly into 0. For instance, there are side quests in 0 that get full-on sequels or continuations in the Kiwami games. Had you not played 0 first, you’d be missing out on that context. Even the main stories of both Kiwami games have additions and changes that are meant to be enjoyed by fans of 0. 

Sometimes you get people who pretend to be purists who recommend you play the series in what they would call “release” order, while failing to understand that their order isn’t release order at all. They might recommend you start with Kiwami 1 and 2, go through to 5, then 0, then 6. If you want to play the games as intended, by all means, do it- but that would mean starting all the way back at the original PS2 Yakuza- starting with Kiwami, even though it’s a remake of the first game, is *not* as satisfying or as engaging, or even as *proper*, an experience as starting with 0 would be. 

In short: yeah, start with 0 and for the love of god, if you’ve even the slightest interest in the series, *please* give it a try. Yakuza is my answer to OP’s question and one of my all-time favorite series. I love it so much more than you could possibly imagine and I just can not even begin to recommend it enough."
PS4,fm56vxb,t1_fm56ev7,1585767425.0,You are a troll. Scurry back to your hole.
PS4,fm56cg2,t1_fm54j1g,1585767142.0,"You are a troll. Responding with two words without any backing isn’t conducive to a decent conversation. But because I can’t resist since I’m... me, unfortunately, I’ll answer your question. 

I had fun with damn near every aspect of it. Yes, I enjoyed hiding from the BTs. I did not use weapons for 95% of the game, including the blood. I had a much better time sneaking and running, and attempting to problem-solve my way out of situations. I had a blast running people over with a truck, I had a blast fist fighting my way through a camp of MULEs, I loved gathering materials and building bridges, I was obsessed with making things easier for other players (the entire social aspect of the game was thrilling and unique to me), I have always loved the experience of exploring an engaging world. I love that there are dozens of ways to approach any given combat scenario. I love love *love* how the environment and terrain contributes to creating some of the most unique and consistently varied gameplay experiences- running through ravines is different from sneaking through wheat fields is different from jumping off of a cliff to take enemies by surprise is different from getting stuck in the mud in a swamp is different from getting into a gunfight in a forest is different from scaling a mountain in a blizzard so thick that you can’t see two feet in front of you. That’s not even close to all of the unique scenarios I experienced while playing. 

I adore games with unique movement mechanics. I loved keeping my balance. I loved running really fast down hills while struggling to stay upright. I loved building up speed and double jumping over rivers. I loved climbing up mountainsides, and all of the interesting ways I could do it. I loved role-playing as Sam, taking extra shoes, making sure he got to drink when he needed it, stopping to take a nap after a long hike, making sure he didn’t spend too long out on deliveries so he could get to a bed and shower to sleep and clean up. Hell, some of my favorite memories are when I was stranded in a field, forgot to bring an extra pair of shoes, and had to slowly walk to my delivery point, taking in the environment and the sounds while thinking about the story and life in general. 

As a matter of fact, up until maybe the final, roughly 6-8 hours of the game (again, roughly 80 total and I’m not even done yet, I can’t wait to go back to it for the 100% when I’m done with some other games), I didn’t even like the story. My biggest issue with the game *was* the story. I thought it kinda sucked. That roughly 50-60 hours of pure, unscripted gameplay I had was *so* fun and *so* engaging that I didn’t want to see the story at all, and that genuinely disappointed me since the story was the biggest selling point for me before I bought it.

Yeah. I think it’s fucking fun man. You don’t have to like it. But it isn’t objectively boring or poorly designed, and from the bit of gameplay I’ve seen of other people, a lot of them *were* playing in a way that would probably be boring. Merely walking from point A to point B while intentionally trying to avoid anything difficult or interesting? Standing in place while spraying blood bullets into a target? Yeah, that’s dull. But setting challenges and restrictions for yourself, engaging with that world, learning it, playing it like how Sam would live it? That’s one of the most fun and unique experiences I’ve ever had with any game ever, and I will continue to play for many many more hours when I do get back to it. I already look forward to doing so. 

If you don’t have anything constructive to say in response, that’s the last I’ve got on the matter."
PS4,fm54a8i,t1_fm546zc,1585766069.0,"Oh, you’re a troll. Got it. Shouldn’t have wasted my time. You don’t have any actual points to make."
PS4,fm545oz,t1_fm540fe,1585766002.0,"And you haven’t played the game. You can’t say that. I had a blast with it, I had more fun with that game than anything else I played last year. That fifty hours I spent actually *playing* the game was fun the whole way through. There’s nothing for me to “admit”."
PS4,fm53vyo,t1_fm4zgtp,1585765860.0,"If you watched “multiple playthroughs”, then you’d know that the vast, vast majority of the game has next to zero cutscenes or scripted set pieces at all. I put in about eighty hours before I hit the ending, and I’d say over fifty of that was spent playing the game outside of scripted sections. There’s a lot of depth and variety in the gameplay. Watching cutscenes or watching people blitz through the main story doesn’t give you an understanding of what the game is or what it’s like. I honestly don’t think your opinion is valid for a game with this much gameplay until you actually play it. Watching a playthrough of a linear story game is one thing. Watching a playthrough of an open world sandbox is another. You absolutely need to play the game to make a judgment about the quality or quantity of its gameplay. You have the right to criticize the story since you likely experienced most of it the same way someone who played it would’ve, but you can’t criticize the game itself."
PS4,fm53222,t3_ft0qol,1585765420.0,"I read all the lore for Control. Control is a really poor example of “superfluous content” because everything in there is so carefully considered. You can get a true 100% on that game, without a guide, in less than 25 hours easy. You could finish it to the end the same way, taking your time, in maybe around half that. It’s a short and sweet game and everything in there exists for a reason. You don’t have to like it, but it’s all carefully considered, it’s not superfluous. 

Subjectively speaking, I’ll read lore for any world or story that interests me and I’ll skip it for games that I don’t care much about, it’s as simple as that. Some games really hook me with their world and I want to learn more about them. For instance, very similar games made by the same developer, I read all the lore in Prey that I could find, but I barely read any of it in the Dishonored games. Not because one is necessarily better than the other, but just because Prey engages me more. 

I also just have to strongly disagree that optional text dialogue is a sign of poor writing- if anything, I tend to feel the opposite. Take for instance the Soulsborne games, especially Bloodborne. Bloodborne has some of the richest, most complex, most artistically poignant story that you’ll ever find in a game, and yet there’s barely any cutscenes and zero exposition. However, had the developers forced the player into watching hours of exposition to explain the story, a lot would’ve been lost. It’s a very gameplay-first experience, it’s all about getting you in that world and letting you experience it all first-hand, making your own stories along the way and solving the mysteries on your own. It forces the player into becoming an active participant in the development of the narrative- not in the way most games do it where it’s just “the plot only moves when you progress”, but in that you, the player, are crafting this story in your own head. The game gives you maybe 60% of what you need to know to start that process, and then you get to finish it. This is not indicative of bad writing, rather, it’s indicative of a strong, confident artistic vision that wants to be interpreted. They don’t want to tell you what you should get out of it, they want you to work towards your own interpretation- and it is work to do so, but at the end of the day you have something personal and meaningful. 

Contrast this with my favorite game of all time, Nier Automata, where the cutscenes are everywhere. Hours upon hours of exposition, tons of exposition, very few stones left unturned. There’s a lot of room for interpretation, but it’s less about solving the mysteries of what happened in the game and more about discovering what those events mean to you personally. Most things are spelled out pretty clearly for the player in the cutscenes, some of which get quite long. This is a game that doesn’t *need* any extra, optional lore- and yet, they chose to add a lot there. Side missions reveal information that may be crucial to you developing your interpretation. Lore entries may provide extra, interesting tidbits of information that you (or at least I personally) would want to know. Because I cared about the world, story, and characters, I chose to read all of it- not because the game required me to do so out of requirement to understand the plot. 

Anyways, point is, I really disagree with at least the way you framed this question. I don’t think something as ubiquitous or as mechanically fundamental as lore entries are indicative of the writing quality one way or another. Last point I want to make here: games are the only medium where this is possible. Games are the only medium where you can choose to ask extra questions of characters, where you can explore the world and find environmental storytelling, where you can choose to skip dialogue you’re not interested in hearing, where you can explore and find optional lore entries. You’re actively participating in how much of that world’s information you receive. That takes guts on behalf of the writer, a level of confidence to not be afraid of allowing the game to speak for itself, whether you’re there to see it or not. Books and movies force all story on you in the way that the creators want you to experience it, the only decision you can make in that instance is to stop watching/reading. Games should lean so much more into that interactivity, *even if it means that you don’t get every single detail*, because this is inherent to the medium and something only obtainable within said medium. I’m not saying games that take inspiration from movies are *bad*, just that I like when games get more creative and brave than that, and I think optional text entries are one way to do just that."
PS4,fm50v5l,t1_fm4jfzg,1585764249.0,"It’s not poorly laid out. It’s shocking, but in a positive, creative, unique way. You could get through that entire game without pulling the map up a single time if you just put a little bit of effort into actually learning the world around you rather than using the map as a crutch. Maps in games are handicaps. If a game is well thought out, well designed, you don’t need a map, even if it’s huge- a game like Red Dead Redemption 2 is proof of that. 

Seriously, close the map and walk around for a while. Have you noticed that there are signs around the world absolutely *everywhere*? Like, damn near every hallway, every door, has a sign that clearly tells you where you’re going. It’s ok to get lost for a bit at first, but if you’re really paying attention, you can memorize that whole entire world without much struggle because it’s so well designed and everything is so carefully considered."

Persona5,flp5s5c,t1_flk9170,1585352243.0,"You seem to have played it (or at least know a lot about it) so you seem like a good person to ask about this. 

I really liked a lot about Persona 5, but I had a few major issues with it that prevented me from enjoying it as much as, say, Persona 4 or 3 or 2. My biggest two issues were with the pacing and the writing. 

So, I felt like a lot of the slice of life, relationship stuff that I loved so much in P4 is just gone in P5. Instead, I feel like we get a lot of just the characters repeating the last major plot point. Like, we need to change someone’s heart. Great, got it. Then each time the thieves meet up or text each other over the next month, they just repeat their goal to each other even though we all know what we’re supposed to be doing. I always felt like that time could’ve been spent much better with slice of life stuff, helping me to connect to the characters as people. I felt like, even without doing social links in P4, I knew way more about those characters than I do the ones in P5, *even with doing the social links.*

On top of that it just regularly felt like there were long stretches of the game where nothing happened and then very short stretches of the game where *lots* of things happened, and that sort of hurt the pacing for me. 

Anyways, I’m not shitting on the game because I like so much about it, it just didn’t appeal to me as much as I’d wanted a new Persona game to appeal to me. Do you have any idea how much, if any, of this has been changed or improved upon? Are there more social events where it’s just scenes of the crew hanging out talking to each other about things besides being Phantom Thieves? I know it’s longer, but do you know if the pacing feels better? I really really want to love Persona 5 and if these things have been improved upon, I might finally be able to love it as much as I want to love it."

Anxiety,fl6014w,t3_eupik4,1584850309.0,"Hello all! So, it’s Saturday again meaning that news has slowed down a little bit. We’re going to do things a bit differently today as such. If you guys don’t like this, let me know. I’m going to focus only on one peer-reviewed editorial, because this study is built entirely around shooting down misinformation, which will actually provide us with the opportunity to go in deep on some of the biggest pieces of false or exaggerated news. We’ll be going off on a couple of tangents so this should be just as long as any other post. Our main source for the day is: [Coronavirus 2019: the harms of exaggerated information and non-evidence based measures by Professor John Ioannidis.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/eci.13222)

The core thesis of the article is that we’re fighting two fronts right now: one against the disease itself, and the other against misinformation. The author breaks down multiple instances of exaggerated, inflammatory stories which have spread across the internet. For instance, the one insinuating that the virus could be man made, despite all evidence pointing to the opposite.

One part that made me feel *especially* vindicated was this:

>”An early speculation that 40-70% of the global population will be infected went viral. Early estimates of the basic reproduction number (how many people get infected by each infected person) have varied widely, from 1.3 to 6.5. These estimates translate into many-fold difference in the proportion of the population eventually infected and dramatically different expectations on what containment measures (or even any future vaccine) can achieve. The fact that containment measures do seem to work, means that the basic reproduction number is probably in the lower bound of the 1.3-6.5 range, and can decrease below 1 with proper measures. The originator of the “40-70% of the population” estimate tweeted on March 3 a revised estimate of “20-60% of adults”, but this is probably still substantially exaggerated. Even after the 40-70% quote was revised downward, it still remained quoted in viral interviews.”

Two things there: one, the “40-70%” number I’ve been railing so hard against *is now fake news*. Two, *our efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus work.* Please, if you want to repay me for anything I’ve done, don’t buy me gold on here- donate to a charity instead, but also *please please please* make a big deal out of the 70% statistic whenever you see it. Hell, make a big deal out of the potential for 60% to be a worst-case scenario type of situation. Everyone needs to be aware that this number is fear mongering at best, and altogether wrong at worst. Focus on two points: one, the same person who made the 40-70% of the world estimation revised his own estimation down to 20-70% of adults. Second, the upper end estimates are *if we do nothing*. Considering that we *are making efforts to fight this*, we will *not* reach those upper end estimations.

Next, the CFR is almost definitely exaggerated and is significantly lower than 3.4%, as Germany and SK (both countries with the most testing) are reporting a 0.2% and 0.7% CFR. We’ve talked about this multiple times before, at length, but here’s what you need to remember: most people don’t have severe symptoms. Therefore, they don’t go to the doctor, they don’t get tested, and they don’t get added to the statistic of “confirmed cases”. The death rate is currently skewed towards already severe cases. The first few waves of people who get confirmed are more likely to be severely ill, meaning that the death rate is going to look a lot higher and a lot scarier than its actuality. As this unfolds, for a plethora of reasons, the CFR is going to drop. Even with that being the case, the actual death rate is going to be even lower simply because of the potentially large population of people who never develop or report their symptoms because their case is so mild.

The author mentions that community spread may be exaggerated as well. In short, there’s a discrepancy between the actual rate of infection and the increase in reported cases. Let’s imagine the next couple weeks together. I have a very strong prediction that the reported cases are going to start going up substantially beyond their current numbers. *However*, this will primarily be because of the fact that testing capacity has increased, not because so many more people are getting sick so quickly. We’re going to be testing more and more as more tests become available, and it’s going to make it look like a large number of people are getting sick all at once. In actuality, the rate of infection and the number of confirmed cases are two very different numbers. We can anticipate that, as physical distancing and proper hygienic measures become more and more prevalent, the rate of infection will decrease. However, confirmed cases will likely continue to rise for a bit of time. This is completely ok and not a discrepancy. The people being confirmed could have been infected days or even weeks ago. These aren’t *necessarily* new infections, just new reported cases. Keep this in mind as the numbers continue to rise- community spread is and will continue to drop as more measures are taken into account, regardless of what the confirmed cases look like.

The author points out that currently there is no evidence that extreme measures are effective, and wants us to remember that personal hygiene and modifications of our normal habits are where this battle is won. Hand washing, avoiding those who may be sick, staying home when you’re sick- these types of measures have the strongest evidence of working right now. Of course, I’m not saying “go out and party”, just the opposite, but rather I want you all to remember how important the basics are, and how important your participation in this truly is. One other point of optimism which I love seeing mention: the measures we’re taking now will likely decrease the spread of *all* viral diseases. The less that people get severely ill from say, the flu, the more hospital staff can be equipped to treat those who need it the most.

We’re reminded of what I assure you that your governments know already: lockdowns cause harm to a society, and can’t last forever. Don’t let the lockdowns scare you, because they are a *temporary* response to the situation- they *will* be lifted. Even the pessimistic Imperial college study which supposedly called for lockdowns for 18 months (it didn’t, but that’s the story) acknowledges that we’d likely need to use these measures as needed but lift restrictions- essentially, off and on lockdowns. Your government doesn’t want to lock you in your home, the economy and our society at large demands that you go to work and buy things. Do not forget the temporary nature of these measures.

Just a few other rapid fire points that the study mentions: the flu isn’t being talked about right now despite still being a threat. News sites are capitalizing on the fear caused by the virus by posting literally hundreds of millions of articles in the span of a week. **People die of disease every day and have done for all of human history. It’s only now that the media wants to report on every single death and scare you into believing that the world is ending.**

The article overall is extremely optimistic and I recommend you read the whole thing, as well as check out the author’s sources. In short: we’re not looking at the end of the world. It just *feels* like it because of the way that the media is handling it, because of the way that people are acting.

I’m *not downplaying the severity of the situation.* Not doing it now, not doing it ever. This is serious. Take all measures you can to avoid catching or spreading the disease. But don’t live in a state of panic- it isn’t so severe that this is a rational response.

Monitor your local news, not national or global news. It simply does not affect you in any constructive way to know how many people died today. You need to know what measures your local governments are taking, you need to know that you should be making some preparations, and you need to know what you should do if you show symptoms. Everything else is just… too much information.

Wash your hands, stay the fuck home, and we will all get through this. Together.

I want to quickly reiterate something I said above. I appreciate anyone and everyone who bought gold for me in the past, but seriously: I don’t need it. If you feel like you need to spend a bit of money, donate to a charity that could use it. [Use this article, pick a charity, and donate $5 if you have some money to spare.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-how-to-help-donations-charities.amp.html) Thank you all truly, but this matters so much more than buying gold for me.

One more point. I understand what it’s like to come to a place like this, in a fit of anxiety or panic, looking for some type of reassurance that everything is going to be ok. These posts are targeted at those of you who can also relate to that experience. Use this information, and anything I post constructively. Make this the last post you read today. The top comment of this thread has some amazing advice- follow it. Close your computer, put your phone down, and use this as a boost of momentum to shut your anxiety down.

Anxiety,fl4ql39,t1_fl4j3a1,1584819191.0,"The “airborne” thing is always so complicated because everyone seems to have a different definition of it. 

It’s not like a cloud that’s flying across the country making people sick. It can’t float through wind and make you sick if you walk down the same sidewalk that a sick person walked down. 

The virus *mainly transmits* through surface contact. Basically, someone who’s sick coughs. The droplets fly from their mouth and land on a surface. Then, you touch the surface, touch your face, and you’re infected. That’s why washing your hands is so goddamn important. 

The virus does have the capacity to transmit through the air, it can be aerosolized. In perfect conditions, it will hang in the air for a few hours. *However*, what we need to understand is that the world rarely operates under these perfect conditions. If you’re on, say, a bus with a couple sick people, you’re breathing in the same circulated air, you could get sick from that. If you walk into a room someone’s coughed in an hour ago, you *might* get sick from that but there’s no major guarantee. 

I linked a study a while back which uses a handful of specific scenarios and sorts them by risk. Walking past a sick person in a hallway is categorized as “no risk”. Sharing a room with a sick person is only categorized as “low risk”. The risk only goes up the longer and more intimately you interact with a sick person. 

See, aerosol transmission is just really unreliable. Wind, temperature, humidity, light, movement, all of this could destabilize the virus. It might be hanging in the air, but it can’t just survive forever in those conditions. The virus has the best chance of survival on surfaces. So... wash your hands, stay at home, and your chances of getting it are low."
Anxiety,fl4evy0,t1_fl3mbot,1584812058.0,"Thank you so much for the kind words! I’d be happy to share that! I want to warn you that I don’t encourage you to click any of these links if you’re currently anxious *just in case* you see something that might be triggering. Some of them are links to exclusively scientific sources, but some have editorialized headlines and such that make it a bit difficult to read. 

-r/COVID19: if you’re looking for the science-based cousin of r/Coronavirus. Because r/COVID19 is more fact and research based, almost everyone there is being calm and rational and optimistic, not alarmist like the other subreddit. Still going to be some scary stuff from time to time, but generally better. 

-statnews.com: this one is a reputable news source, but sometimes they get more carried away with editorialization than they should, since they should be one of the responsible ones. They’re a medical news site first and foremost, but they’re probably getting a lot more traffic now than they used to be and are trying to keep that traffic up by writing some scarier headlines. 

-https://www.nejm.org/coronavirus: probably my personal favorite. Just a collection of research and opinions from actual professionals and experts. 

-https://www.thelancet.com/coronavirus: another research based site. 

I probably have some others as well that I can’t remember off the top of my head, but if I do, I’ll find them. 

Basically, it boils down to just working to dig through the crap and find actual scientific sources. I’ve had to click through inflammatory headlines several times just to find the study they’re referencing only to discover that the actual study isn’t that scary. Like the “Coronavirus survives for three days on surfaces!” story from earlier in the week- not a responsible or accurate reading of the original study, *but*, the news reporting on it enabled me to find the actual study and find the truth behind it. So pros and cons. 

To be honest, and I don’t say this as a “you should just rely on me for all your news”, I don’t encourage people to go and do their own googling and sifting through data. If you’d like to read the ones I linked, I did so for a reason and I think they should be safe for anyone to read, *but*, googling “Coronavirus news” is not conducive to finding optimistic research. If you or anyone else is unstable right now and you start searching for your own information, you’re going to find scary stuff, primarily from the media. That can be overwhelming, stressful, or at least tiring, even when it isn’t true. That’s part of what contributed to me taking a couple days off. But if you’re feeling strong, by all means, do your own research as well! Just always know that it’s a bit of a dangerous line you walk if you do."
Anxiety,fl4dgaw,t1_fl3k1ln,1584811200.0,"I don’t have a concrete answer for you, but I have a pretty solid guess. Since this is still early in this whole situation, lots of folks were/are hospitalized both for the purposes of quarantining and for observation. If the patient wasn’t hospitalized, this discovery wouldn’t have been made, and if, god forbid, her condition took a turn for the worse, she’d be able to get immediate treatment. 

That’s totally just a guess though. I’m certain the doctors had solid reasoning for deciding to hospitalize her though."
Anxiety,fl389xt,t3_fj2y1a,1584772487.0,"Hello all!

[Finally got my next post up tonight- feel free to take a look!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fl2y4yc)

Tonight we talked even more about death rates, asymptomatic cases, IFR vs. CFR, mutations... hope you enjoy it! Feel free to ask any questions you may have, I’ll be happy to (at least try to) answer!"
Anxiety,fl376op,t1_fl36uj9,1584771272.0,"I think everything I just described above absolutely applies! Anything relating to the virus itself or efforts to fight it absolutely apply to the entire planet and everyone on it. The virus isn’t going to only mutate to be less effective in the US, for instance. 

To be honest, I’m not an expert on how most countries are handling this. I know how my country is handling it and I know a bit about how the major hotspots are handling it. Any advice you see relating to other countries absolutely applies to you though- wash your hands, stay home, practice physical distancing, all of that. I wish I had some more concrete answers for you about your country in particular, but I definitely know that the broad strokes about the virus itself will certainly apply to everyone, no need to fear on that part."
Anxiety,fl36wo4,t1_fl32wvk,1584770971.0,"Let me give you the easy, straightforward answer first, the one that’s not all ooey gooey emotional. After reading the studies, I’m just not seeing much to be genuinely scared of from the disease itself. I started off when I first came here weeks ago being terrified, panicky, and the more I read (from *reliable primary sources*), the less scared I became. That’s not me downplaying the severity of it- it is severe, there are deaths and will continue to be. It is scary. But it’s also just *not the end of the world*, this doesn’t strike me as something that could wipe us out. Just from all of the studies I’ve read, it doesn’t fill me with fear or dread after seeing/reading them. Humanity has survived worse, and we’re probably going to be faced with worse in the future. 

Look, here’s the thing: we need each other now more than ever. We need each other to be calm and rational and optimistic. I need that from you, you need that from me, everyone needs that from each other. The only way we get through this is by making smart decisions together. We can’t make smart decisions when we’re panicked, rationality can’t exist when your mind is overrun with emotion. If I can keep myself optimistic, I can keep myself rational. If I can keep those around me optimistic, they can think rationally too, and hopefully those people can do the same for others and so on. 

I’m sorry for dumping out everything I’m about to dump out here, but honestly, this kind of stuff has been on my mind a lot lately. I’m about to ramble for a minute, honestly, this is entirely selfish because I think better through writing. You didn’t ask for this, but I need to say it all somewhere, I guess. 

The more complicated answer is... I honestly don’t know. I don’t know how this is going to play out. I don’t know what’s going to happen next. I know that me personally, I’ve been through so much in my life that I guess this was kind of easy to compartmentalize? It just *has* to work out. I know it has to work out. I have seen people do awful stuff to each other, I’ve been impacted by the awful stuff that people do to each other, I’ve done awful stuff. People have done worse to each other than any virus ever could. Life sucks. It’s always sucked. It always will suck. 

There was a time in my life when I genuinely wanted to die. Nearly did too. I came out of that time searching desperately for answers and I never found them. I don’t know why I’m still alive. I don’t know why I keep going, I don’t know why any of us do. And yet, here we are, against literally all odds. I’m still standing, even though I shouldn’t be. So are you. So is anyone reading this post right now. 

I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately. I’ve been thinking about why we should be positive. I’ve been thinking about why we should go on living. I still don’t have an answer for myself, let alone for you. I just... I *feel* a reason. I don’t have a grasp on it, but I know it’s there. I know that I wouldn’t be alive right now if I didn’t have a reason to be. I’m not talking about anything spiritual, I’m not a believer in that, but it’s just that, I guess life is a reason in and of itself? And I guess that I don’t feel like it should be spent alone, or doubting, or depressed, or anxious. 

I have a lot of life I still need to live. I realize that now. I’ve made so many mistakes in my time. I haven’t really ever *lived*, and now, this happens. I need to be optimistic that I can have that life when this is over. I just can’t believe that anything will stop that from happening, because if I let myself believe that, I’ve given up. And I can’t give up. 

I recently saw a phrase that really stuck with me. “You’ve survived everything you’ve ever been through.” That hit me hard. If I lose hope now, then all of that, my past, my mistakes, my experiences, all of it was fucking worthless. It had no meaning. Maybe it’s spite or stubbornness or something, I don’t know, but I simply can’t let go. I’m still here and I’m not going anywhere, I just refuse to let that happen. I’ve been told that I was worthless, by other people but most of all myself, and I fucking *refuse* to let that be true. 

Sorry. Those are a lot of words to get to “I don’t know”. I wish I could be more concise. Whatever happens will happen. I can’t control that. All I can control is myself and my thoughts and my actions, and if, god forbid, the world literally is ending, at least I can say that I went out grinning in the face of it. If I can say that, then I’m not a waste of a life like I used to think I was. 

Of course, that’s all my emotions talking, none of it is factual. Again, I just don’t think this truly could be apocalyptic from what I’ve seen. The science behind all of this doesn’t scare me. I’ve read every study I could get my hands on, and I haven’t seen a single thing that’s made me question my optimism. Maybe everything I just said would be different if it did. I can’t say for sure. 

Anyways, there’s your answer, probably significantly more than you’d expected or wanted. Pragmatically speaking, fear and regret don’t get me what I want or need. Optimism does. 

Oh, and also, I’m washing my hands and not watching the news too much so that helps keep the fear down :P"
Anxiety,fl2yyus,t1_fl2yq74,1584763703.0,"Might be an idea! I honestly don’t have an answer for you right now, beyond maybe the costs and time it would take to start an entirely new vaccine development? We are already on phase one trials of at least one vaccine, so starting fresh may not be the best idea- but I genuinely don’t know, your idea makes sense to me. It might prove to be effective. 

In an ideal scenario, the virus will undergo similar mutations in the rest of the world so hopefully it would be easier to use at that point, more globally available. Fingers crossed on that one."
Anxiety,fl2y4yc,t3_eupik4,1584763043.0,"Hello everyone! Let’s jump right into today’s good news! It’s another sciency type of day :P

-[We’ll kick it off with this story from scientists at the University of Melbourne.](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/03/200317103815.htm) If you click that link, the first thing you’ll see is an incredibly reassuring headline which mostly speaks for itself: *“The immune system can fight back”*. This is a bit of a case study of one person, not a full-scale study with a large sample size. However, the discoveries made were frankly incredible. The patient in question is a hospitalized woman in her 40s with mild to moderate symptoms. Essentially, after three days in the hospital, doctors noticed that her body was producing a ton of immune cells- that’s a sign that your body is winning the fight, kicking the virus out. After this, the doctors predicted she’d only need three more days to recover, and they were right! Here’s the key point you need to know: *your body’s response to this virus is extremely similar to its flu response*. Basically, while you don’t have a natural immunity, your body is able to successfully fight it off using the same tactics as how it’d fight off the flu. This is fantastic news, it demonstrates even further that this is more than survivable, and when this information is combined with everything else we’ve talked about, your prognosis should you get the virus is just looking better and better.

-[Next, I want to share this report with you, although it requires a bit of pre-explanation.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.14.20036178v1) So, I need to explain a bit about modeling and estimations. Everything in this study boils down to being an extremely educated, well constructed, mathematically plausible… guess. The researchers used South Korea as a model. We know that SK is being honest with their numbers, and we know that they’re testing a *ton* of people, potentially more per capita than any other country is doing. The numbers in SK have been, therefore, rather large but also very optimistic. The researchers took the information we have from SK (using them as a benchmark country) and then used it as a model to attempt to create an educated guess as to roughly how many cases *actually* exist in China.

I feel the need to explain a bit further on one more topic before we get to the results of the study. Generally speaking, with any disease, the actual number of infections is going to be *higher* than the reported number. This is for one very simple reason: not everyone who gets sick goes to the doctor. With this in mind, epidemiologists use two numbers to determine the death rate. One is the CFR, or case fatality ratio. This is simple: you take all of the deaths, you divide it by the number of confirmed cases, and you multiply it by 100. It’s a simple, concrete number and calculation that is generally reliable… until you start getting hypothetical. See, reality isn’t that clean cut, and we have to assume that in fact there are more people out there who were not ever confirmed to have the virus. This is where models come in, where we start to make estimations of the *actual* infection rate. When we do this, we get a new, substantially larger (but potentially inaccurate) number of estimated actual infections. We can then divide the deaths by this new estimation, multiply it by 100, and get the infected fatality ratio, or IFR. By nature, the IFR will be a smaller number than the CFR. This attempts to more accurately resemble reality, but the hypothetical nature of it leaves some room for error.

Enough of this, let’s talk about what the study concluded. By using SK as a benchmark, they estimate that the *actual* number of infections in China is not the currently reported 81,000, but instead *700,000*. I feel the need to assure you- this is actually a genuinely great thing, the higher this number is, the better. If we use this to calculate the IFR (3,255 deaths/700,000 actual cases*100), we get 0.465%. I refer you back to [this post of mine](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fkpi8jv) which links you to several studies approximating the fatality rate at between 0.5 and 1 percent- this is a bit further indication that this might be the actual death rate. Again, this is an estimation (pre-print too), but there’s several different groups of people getting similar results using different methods… giving me more hope.

-A little bit more evidence towards a high asymptomatic population (https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)30139-9/pdf). This study estimates that 30.8% of those infected are asymptomatic- again, if this is the case, the death rate is in fact lower than currently estimated.

-There were some fears regarding using NSAIDs (think ibuprofen) and the potential for them to cause complications in a COVID-19 patient. [This article](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-gives-advice-use-non-steroidal-anti-inflammatories-covid-19) lays out that there is no evidence for this to be the case, and therefore we should not be worried about taking or being prescribed said medication at this time.

-[This pre-print article](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v2) makes two major, exciting claims. First, following China’s lockdown, they were able to reduce the rate of infection (R0) to 0.58. This tells us two things: China’s intervention *worked*, so the virus can be stopped. I also personally take this as indication that we don’t need to take actions quite as severe as China’s to slow the rate of infection down to tolerable, safe levels. The other major claim from this article is maybe a bit overly optimistic- they estimate a 0.04-1.2 IFR. I would not be surprised if it gets to that level by this time next year on a global scale, but that’s just me. 

-[Final study of the night, my personal favorite.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.987222v1.full.pdf) I went into detail in the past explaining mutations and how, if a virus seeks to be successful at replicating and infecting as many hosts as possible, it must be extremely non-lethal. In short, you’re not infecting anyone if your host isn’t out and about doing stuff, and they won’t be out and about doing stuff if they’re in a quarantine unit in a hospital.

I need to be very careful with what I’m about to say next: this study *indicates that the virus might*  **possibly** have already mutated, in Singapore, in such a way that it’s become *less effective overall*. First of all, Singapore has currently only reported 385 cases and zero deaths. This could be for a plethora of reasons, and one *potential* reason (not a definite!) is that this strain of the virus is both less effective and less lethal. Now, let’s talk about the study just a little bit.

I urge you to read this study- I promise you it shouldn’t have anything triggering for you, so check it out if genetics interest you. I want to be absolutely certain that I’m not stretching what I’m about to say, so I’m going to quote the study:

>“The deletion also removes the ORF8 transcription-regulatory sequence, which in turn enhances the downstream transcription of the N gene. We also found that viruses with the deletion have been circulating for at least four weeks. During the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, a number of genetic variants were observed in the human population, and similar variation has since been observed across SARS-related CoVs in humans and bats. Overwhelmingly these viruses had mutations or deletions in ORF8, that have been associated with reduced replicative fitness of the virus. This is also consistent with the observation that towards the end of the outbreak sequences obtained from human SARS cases possessed an ORF8 deletion that may be associated with host adaptation. We therefore hypothesise that the major deletion revealed in this study may lead to an attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2.”

In English for you: *for at least four weeks in Singapore, a strain of the virus has circulated with a deletion in its DNA, which has been seen in other coronaviruses such as SARS from 2003. This deletion results in the virus being less effective, less replicable-*  **less infectious.** The researchers hypothesize two points: one, this may result in an “attenuated phenotype” (less effective) version of the virus. Two, the virus did this because the specific strand of DNA which was deleted may trigger the body’s immune system to more aggressively target the virus. In other words, if you get infected with this new version, it’s likely that your immune system will fight less against it. But, since the virus is less replicable, you’re less likely to get it, so this may not end up being a major concern. Considering that the death rate in Singapore remains at 0, and that the rest of the virus is unchanged, it may not be any more lethal than the current version.

As always, if you have any questions, feel free to ask- here, private message, chat, on the Discord, whatever works best for you.

I hope that this can give you a nice, strong boost of momentum today. If it did, use it, don’t just sit on it. Put your phone down, close your computer, go for a walk, clean your house, get some work done, focus on a hobby, call a friend- do *something* to get your mind off of it. You can do this guys. I know this week has been… crazy, and scary, but remember that everything we’re doing is for the best. We’re preventing spread, we’re flattening the curve, what we’re doing **will work** and it will save lives. And most importantly: it’s all temporary. Life won’t be like this forever. I love you all and I will see you next time.

Anxiety,fl05lqp,t3_eupik4,1584692558.0,"Hello all!

Wanted to give you folks an update, you all deserve as much with how kind and gracious and appreciative you’ve been. If you’ve not been following my posts, this won’t mean much to you, so feel free to just skip along if so :P

I decided to take some time off from the internet, almost entirely, over the last couple days. No need to worry at all- I’m doing great mentally, I just simply needed a bit of “no internet” time. As you all know all too well, the internet is... stressful, even when life is normal. When you add something like this, it becomes even more stressful. 

I felt the fatigue setting in and I decided that, rather than write some sub-par stuff (I made a mistake in my last post that I’ll address in a minute, and I’m determined not to do it again), I needed to take a bit of time to relax and get my mind off of it. On my days off, I’ve been playing games with my friends online, watching 30 Rock, walking my dog, catching up on some much needed sleep, cleaning, preparing for the work from home I’m going to have to do... anything I can do to get my mind off of the situation. 

I strongly, strongly, *strongly* encourage you to do the same or similar. Seriously. If you can, leave your phone turned off for a day. Try your absolute best *not* to check the news. If you take a day off and something major happens that you need to know about, you’ll find out about it, seriously. If that’s not possible for you, maybe limit yourself to checking one single time a day and not any more than that. I know this is easier said than done, believe me, I had to fight really hard against myself to keep away from it, but I did a decent job and I feel so much more invigorated now. 

I planned on writing for you tonight, but the short of it is that I still need a little bit more time. I have five studies I plan on talking about, and I have a lot to say about each- and that doesn’t even go into the news I have as well. 

I mentioned above that my last post contained a mistake- shout out to u/soultronix for catching it in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fkswirk/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf). I went into detail on my rationale for choosing the numbers I chose to tell you about, but the simple fact is that I said the wrong thing and I genuinely wish that I didn’t. I don’t know how big of a deal it is to you folks, but it matters a great deal to me because my intention with all of this was to fight misinformation and yet I ended up sharing something without properly explaining why I chose the numbers I did. This stuff matters, and I refuse to make a similar mistake again. 

As such, rather than risk making more mistakes or writing something subpar, combined with my need for a rest, I chose to take those days off. If I make a similar decision in the future, I will let you know *ahead* of time. 

But! I can’t leave you with nothing. Tomorrow, we’re talking more about treatments, the fact that the immune system can fight off this virus (and a bit about how that works), an early epidemiological study on Wuhan which has some fantastically optimistic numbers for the fatality and infection rates, further information and evidence for my earlier statements on mutations making the virus *less* lethal, asymptomatic patients... it’s going to be a lot, and those are just the studies!

If you want a bit of good news from the last two days, the least I can do is link you to a couple personal favorites I found when starting my research for my next post. Here’s [one](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/carnival-offers-use-of-its-cruise-ships-as-temporary-covid-19-care-hospitals-2020-03-19), ~~two (sorry, mistake on the link here, fix it soon)~~ [three](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/19/us/fastest-supercomputer-coronavirus-scn-trnd/index.html), [four](https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/dolphins-appear-in-italian-waterways-as-coronavirus-keeps-tourists-away/), and [five](https://apnews.com/6f2e666485e9abae4bb112251eca77be) stories that I personally enjoyed seeing.

PS4,fkvkdxo,t1_fkvjnhi,1584570993.0,"PS1->PS2, buddy."
Anxiety,fkusyco,t1_fktliwa,1584555553.0,"That’s not exactly what it’s saying. 

First of all, it’s basing the 18 months estimation on the current timeline to a vaccine. What the study says is, quote: 

>”The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package – or something equivalently effective at reducing transmission – will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) – given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed. We show that intermittent social distancing – triggered by trends in disease surveillance – may allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily in relative short time windows, but measures will need to be reintroduced if or when case numbers rebound. Last, while experience in China and now South Korea show that suppression is possible in the short term, it remains to be seen whether it is possible long-term, and whether the social and economic costs of the interventions adopted thus far can be reduced.”

In other words, it postulates that the most effective way to keep this suppressed is to practice social distancing until the vaccine is deployed. That’s kind of common sense, to be honest- you take the most extreme measures consistently until those extreme measures are no longer necessary, and you’ll get the most positive results. It also, however, acknowledges that there are severe drawbacks to operating society like this. 

If I worked 24 hours a day for a week, I’d make way more money than if I worked 8 hours a day for five days a week. But there’s drawbacks. I get tired, I get unhealthy, and my work will quickly start to deteriorate. 

If we locked down society for 18 months, the economy couldn’t support that. Society couldn’t handle it for that long. The paper acknowledges this. This is why they mention that intermittent social distancing will be effective so long as we don’t allow numbers to spike too dramatically during that time. They also acknowledge that, as China and SK have proven, this short term suppression *is* possible. 

The obvious risk is, well, the virus can and likely will be reintroduced. China’s numbers are probably going to go up again if they start relaxing things. The same could be true for any other country that manages to get a grip on this. 

However, this is all to say: we want to *flatten the curve*. Not cut it off completely. To cut off the virus completely would be to oppress the people and essentially shit down society and the global economy for a year and a half and that merely is not feasible. Luckily, not only is it not feasible, but it also isn’t necessary. 

If we can start to flatten the curve, reduce the rates of transmission, we can help our healthcare systems to get through this without being overburdened. This is our overarching goal. Intermittent social distancing like what we’re beginning to do now will be dramatically effective at this. Additionally, as more people are exposed to the virus and develop immunity, the risk to society at large will diminish. If this truly lasts 18 months, the worst of it will be soon, but it’ll be short and temporary. 

This study also doesn’t take into account things like increased testing, medical breakthroughs, new treatments, and an overall increase of social consciousness in regards to health and hygiene. More people are washing their hands and not shaking hands and not touching gross surfaces now than ever before- that’s going to not only reduce COVID transmission, but transmission of most viruses in general. 

When you combine all of this, I think the 18 month estimate seems a bit off base. We might have to practice social distancing on and off for the next 18 months as spikes happen, sure, but we’ll get better at tracking and testing those spikes. 

For instance- it’s expected that the rate of infection will likely drop at least somewhat in the summer, not necessarily because the virus doesn’t like heat but for many other reasons. I’ve talked about this in another post. If that happens, then social distancing will likely let up and things will be more normalized during the warmer months. Now, if it starts to spike again in, say, November, then we may need to fall back on some of the habits we’re starting to practice now. But by then, we’ll have better testing capacity, better treatments, and more knowledge of the virus in general. The risks on each potential future spike get lessened each time said spike occurs.

All of this is just addressing the summary too, there’s more to say on the rest of the study but much of it would just be further discussion on what I mentioned above.

**Edit:** Wanted to add just a couple more quotes from the study to further my points. 

>”Through the hospitalisation of all cases (not just those requiring hospital care), China in effect initiated a form of case isolation, reducing onward transmission from cases in the household and in other settings. At the same time, by implementing population-wide social distancing, the opportunity for onward transmission in all locations was rapidly reduced. Several studies have estimated that these interventions reduced R to below 1.”

>”Given local epidemics are not perfectly synchronised, local policies are also more efficient and can achieve comparable levels of suppression to national policies while being in force for a slightly smaller proportion of the time. However, we estimate that for a national GB policy, social distancing would need to be in force for at least 2/3 of the time (for R0=2.4, see Table 4) until a vaccine was available.”

Keep in mind that above quote doesn’t acknowledge anything external, just a model based on stats of the past couple months. It doesn’t acknowledge treatments, seasons, or social changes. 

The study overall is a bit more pessimistic than I am, and more than other studies I’ve seen, but it’s also very focused on one specific aspect of spread."
PS4,fku9xe0,t1_fku2khm,1584545323.0,"Because the PS5 can’t create new content or magically improve the graphical settings of a last gen game. If a game doesn’t have 4K textures built-in, the PS5 can’t *create* 4K textures. It can *upscale* the game to 4K, but ultimately you’re still playing a 1080p game. A PS5 can’t create ray-tracing in a game that doesn’t have it. It can’t create textures to overlay on windows and mirrors and water to create reflections if the game doesn’t already have reflections. It can’t spawn in additional NPCs or create extra foliage or better particle effects. 

All a PS4 game can do on PS5 is run better. It can be upscaled, it can run at a higher frame rate, it can load faster- but it won’t be a PS5 game. If developers/publishers want their last gen game to look or perform or be competitive with current gen releases, they *have* to make a new port. Only question is whether or not they charge for it, and if they did, it wouldn’t be ridiculous or greedy assuming they put enough work into it."
PS4,fku9dre,t1_fktv12b,1584545001.0,"I don’t see why these two things have to be mutually exclusive. PS1 and PS2, PS2 and PS3, as well as GameCube and Wii, and Wii and Wii U just off the top of my head all had both backwards compatibility with their previous generation as well as cross-gen releases and upgraded ports. It’s always going to be up to the publisher/developer. 

The PS5 will play PS4 games, but we don’t know to what capacity exactly. For instance, if PS4 was BC and I popped the PS3 version of GTA V into my PS4, I’d be getting a *vastly* different experience when compared to my PS4 version of GTA V. The PS3 version might run at a higher resolution or frame rate, but it can’t magically produce all of the dozens of major additions that the PS4 version has. I’m not just talking about content, but the graphical and technical changes and improvements as well. As far as we know, the PS5’s backwards compatibility won’t be able to remake and recreate the game with better assets and more technically impressive graphical settings- that’s a ridiculous idea anyways. A PS4 on PS5 game will likely just have higher frame rate and resolution. 

I don’t see why a developer couldn’t port over their old versions if they want to continue supporting them. Take a game like, say, the new Avengers title this year. It’s meant to be a live-service game. If the developers reach a point where PS4 can’t keep up technically with the content they want to create, they’re going to have to release a new version of the same game on PS5- they can’t just cut access to the PS4 on PS4 owners while having the PS5 owners still use their PS4 discs. Bungie had to do that with Destiny 1, Rockstar had to do it with GTA V, and with all of the many live-service games these days it’s probably going to be relatively common for a year or two. 

The only question is, do publishers/developers charge extra for the PS5 ports, or do they give away free/discounted versions of them? It’s not absurd to think they might charge and it wouldn’t be greedy if they did, assuming that they actually had to put a decent amount of work into upgrading the game for new consoles. 

Of course, there’s going to be dozens of single-player or low-requirement games out in 2019 and 2020 which are right on that cusp but won’t *need* next-gen ports in the way that a live service game would. Even if they don’t *need* it though, developers/publishers might still do it. 

Anyways, you’re being awfully dismissive over something that isn’t a ridiculous thing to be discussing. There’s a whole plethora of reasons why paid ports and/or upgraded versions might end up happening."
DestinyTheGame,fku70y7,t1_fkssm1o,1584543607.0,Exactly. Not much excitement in waiting until Friday just to buy a Fated and have the gun in a matter of seconds. Just doesn’t feel special. I’m glad we’ve moved away from that somewhat.
DestinyTheGame,fku6vr8,t3_fkapho,1584543521.0,"I’m ok with those being the objectives so long as there’s a payoff at the end of the quest line that isn’t just “here’s the gun!” I’ve not done Fourth Horseman yet so I can’t speak to how it ends, but...

There’s quests like Ace, TLW, or Thunderlord which do have long, grindy, bounty-like objectives. However, those quests have really great payoffs at the end. Awesome, story based quests with unique objectives and rewarding lore. It’s so hard to forget those final missions, but it’s very easy to forget the boring bounty-like objectives to get there. When you do the final bespoke mission, you’re immediately rewarded with the gun too, making the whole affair even cooler and more exciting. 

Long and arduous tasks are honestly good for this kind of thing. Bungie can’t make entire bespoke campaigns for every exotic they put in the game, but if we’re lucky they may be able to make one *mission* for each exotic. However, it would not be fair to the player-base if the mission was just given to you and finished in less than 30 minutes- we need that grind, we need a reason to play. These types of objectives keep us playing, ultimately that’s what we all want to do, is play this game while working towards goals that matter to us. 

Having difficult/long objectives for exotics is good because it makes the end result feel worth it. It prevents *everyone* from having it, which in turn makes us feel special when we *do* get it. If we didn’t have those objectives, it just wouldn’t feel special anymore. But these quests do still need some special payoff at the end, not just “good job killing guys in year one destinations, here’s the gun!”

Of course, then we have Bastion which kinda fucked up that whole thing where you do have to do boring objectives, then a really awesome, bespoke mission with lots of depth and story, and then you have to do more boring objectives. That was a misstep entirely."
Anxiety,fku4gnm,t1_fksxvc8,1584542041.0,"So, as far as I currently understand it, and I could be entirely wrong (I can’t find a conclusive study on any of this), I believe that the risks associated with actively smoking comes from the many additional complications caused by the habit. 

Remember that smoking doesn’t *just* cause COPD. Smoking is also associated with complications such as [diabetes, hypertension/heart disease, persistent cough and reduced lung capacity not necessarily caused by COPD](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324644). The first two of this short list are absolutely high-risk factors. These are also both progressive conditions- you can be in the early stages of them and be entirely unaware. [This article also goes into detail on](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.scientificamerican.com/article/smoking-or-vaping-may-increase-the-risk-of-a-severe-coronavirus-infection1/%3famp=true) how actively smoking or vaping is associated with lung inflammation and suppressed immunity- two conditions you don’t want to have if you catch this (or any respiratory) virus. This last part may also partially explain why long-term exposure to polluted air (like the air in several Chinese cities) also appears to be associated with increased risk. 

You’re doing active damage to your body when you smoke. When you quit, even if you’ve developed long-term complications like COPD, your body is able to begin healing. It’s able to more actively fight off infection."
Anxiety,fkt3xwq,t1_fkswirk,1584505570.0,"You’re entirely correct, yep. If I may just explain my rationale behind choosing the >50% to mention here. 

So, the >50% number comes from the raw, cumulative reports on both confirmed infected and reported asymptomatic. In other words, anyone who was sick and also showed no symptoms goes in there regardless of when their recovery occurs. You’ll note several things in that study- the time of infection, the true asymptomatic proportion, and a detailed description of their clinical progression is not available, unfortunately. This does cause obvious limitations. Most importantly: the cumulative asymptomatic number includes both true asymptomatic cases as well as those who may have been asymptomatic at one point and developed symptoms later, as you rightly point out. 

These limitations are of course taken into account with the rest of the study, and are important to acknowledge- I didn’t mean to downplay them or withhold any information. I intentionally chose the raw cumulative numbers to calculate the percentage because, for one, it’s simpler and my post was long enough as it was (if you’d like to see the paragraphs I edited out of that bit, which addressed these limitations and the modeling procedure and findings, I’m happy to share them). 

Most importantly, I chose the raw data because it fit in clearer with my thesis (also because the number you rightly point out is an estimation derived from a model). That’s not necessarily fair in a scientific setting, I’ll own up to that. However, the point I was attempting to drive home is the fact that with such a large asymptomatic population, many of whom are likely out there right now without even knowing it, our current CFR is likely lower and our true infection numbers are likely higher. I also wanted to make the point that people who are asymptomatic aren’t shown to necessarily spread the virus as far as we are currently aware, meaning that hopefully the longer they’re asymptomatic, the fewer people they’ll infect. It’s an unnecessarily optimistic view of the scenario, but I am trying to share that unnecessary optimism where I can. 

Additionally I don’t want to bog any of this down. Something I’ve mentioned in these in the past is that I’m constantly trying to ride the line between “too much information” and “not enough information”. I don’t want to overwhelm or scare anyone, but at the same time, I don’t want to withhold anything important- if this was a case of not giving enough, then I really do apologize for that. 

I do apologize if that got lost at any point, as well. Hope that didn’t come across as defensive or anything, your point is entirely correct and it’s my fault for not going into further detail where it may have been necessary. I swear I’d edit in at least a link to your comment but I’m literally like two characters away from the limit. Anyways, feel free to tell me if you think I’m wrong in my decision and I will absolutely link to your comment and correct it in my post tomorrow. **Edit**- ehh, actually, I’m just going to do it anyways. I’m always open to being fact-checked, it’s important and I would absolutely hate to be responsible for any spreading of misinformation.

To your other points- thank you very much for the compliment, it means a lot to me! I’m currently a college student, older than most of my peers because I’ve made some mistakes in my time, working on my BS in Psychology, although within the last year I’ve really strongly considered taking it further into grad school with some form of public health angle, if I can get in.

It seemed you folks enjoyed my long post from yesterday here, OP was kind enough to share it with you all on this thread so I decided to start linking it here as well. I totally understand that not everyone wants to check the megathread because you’d rather just see the good stuff- that’s totally fair! [Here’s a link to my post today](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fkss5ea) full of great information like using the Diamond Princess to estimate low global spread (possibly around 20%!), various actions taken by governments to keep their citizens healthy and safe at this time, and more information on what we’re doing to stop all of this. 

Best wishes to all of you, and I will see you tomorrow!"
Anxiety,fkss5ea,t3_eupik4,1584497131.0,"Hello hello everyone! Hope you’re all doing as well as you possibly can be today, and hopefully by the time you’re done reading today’s news and information, you’ll be feeling even better! Let’s get this train rolling. 

We’re going to look at the Diamond Princess again today, and before we do, I would like to explain why this situation is so perfect for epidemiological study. If you’ve been reading my posts, you’ve probably seen me mention the phrase “perfect conditions” once or twice. Let me tell you: there is almost no condition more perfect for rapid disease spread than there is on a cruise ship. We’re looking at close quarters, recirculated air, surfaces like handrails, elevator buttons, doorknobs being touched by potentially thousands of people per day- and of course, everyone’s relaxed and maybe not stressing too much about hygiene. Few, if any of these people, were washing their hands or disinfecting surfaces the way that all of us here (and millions of other people globally) likely are. 

Even with this being the case, only 17% of all people on board the ship tested positive, and that statistic as well as all facts on this topic come from [this recent, fantastic, positive study](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000180#html_fulltext). Out of 3,711 people on board, a cumulative total of 634 tested positive. Here’s where things get even more interesting: of that  total of 634, 320 of them were *asymptomatic*. 

Let’s talk a little bit about what this means. First of all, I would like to remind everyone of Marc Lipsitch and his current estimation of the global population getting infected. I’d link it if I could but it’s a twitter link which gets blocked, but if you google his name and the statistic 20-60%, you should find his tweet where he claims that he estimates 20-60% of all adults on the planet will get infected in approximately a year’s time. I want to clarify- this is the guy who originally estimated that to be 40-70%, and after new findings showed that the rate of infection might be lower than previously thought, he revised his estimation. Additionally, the high end there is a “worst case, what if no one in the world does anything to stop this” scenario. If you see anyone claiming the 70% statistic, you can shoot them down with this fact. 

Anyways, two major conclusions I want to draw here. The 20% estimate seems to be in line with the cruise ship, where 17% of passengers were confirmed positive, despite those perfect conditions I mentioned above. On a global scale then, scaling things up and accounting for mistakes and unique scenarios and all of the imperfections of the real world, the lower end of that 20-60% number seems even more feasible. 

Second, **over 50% of the cases were asymptomatic.** This is *huge* news. For one thing, even if you’re asymptomatic, you will most likely still develop at least a short term immunity to the virus- when you fight it off, you won’t get it again or spread it. Combine this with a study I linked a few days ago which indicates that those who are recovering are either not contagious or dramatically less contagious, and our concerns for asymptomatic transmission are reduced even further. 

Lastly on this topic, here’s a quote from the study: *“Currently, there is no clear evidence that COVID-19 asymptomatic persons can transmit SARS-CoV-2, but there is accumulating evidence indicating that a substantial fraction of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals are asymptomatic”.* According to this study, asymptomatic transmission may not be a *major* concern. Of course, it does state that there is “currently no clear evidence”, so this is subject to change, and we should not take the risk of spreading it if we are asymptomatic. Anyone who comes in contact with the virus should still self-isolate for 14 days, but on a broad scale- this is amazing news. I’m summarizing all of this to the best of my ability because I want to cover more, so please, *ask questions if I didn’t clarify anything here enough*. 

-[Juuust in case you had any lingering fears](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9), no, the virus is *not* man-made. 

-[Trump and his Secretary of Treasury have called on a $1 trillion+ sized stimulus package](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.politico.com/amp/news/2020/03/17/coronavirus-1-trillion-emergency-stimulus-133821) in response to the outbreak. This package includes $250 billion for small businesses and $500 billion for individual citizens- they’re looking to either cut payroll taxes or send direct checks to all adults. Combined with various [ISPs pledging not to suspend service](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.axios.com/isps-promise-fcc-they-wont-shut-off-service-during-pandemic-eec76a46-61a8-4673-a8a9-981ead4094c3.html) and companies all across the country pledging not to suspend utilities or evict people for not being able to pay rent (I’d post links but it’s a state-by-state thing- look for your state’s recent announcements to see if you will benefit from this), money should hopefully be less of a concern for most Americans in the coming weeks. If your state has not announced any such plans or policies, don’t lose hope, it’s likely to happen. 

-[The UK has announced a fast-tracked Coronavirus bill](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-bill-what-it-will-do/what-the-coronavirus-bill-will-do) with fantastic stipulations. It will: increase available health and social care workforce, ease the burden on frontline staff, contain and slow the virus, and support citizens by allowing them to claim statutory sick pay while also support the food industry to continue to keep people fed. If you need more detail on this and how it affects you, keep an eye on that website and any developments surrounding it. 

-[Here’s a list of currently in-use drugs](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1162021) which show promise as treatment for the virus. Advantages of this? We don’t need to prove that it’s safe for human consumption if these are already FDA approved, we just need to do trials to prove that it’s effective and safe treatment for this specific virus. These drugs will *hopefully*, therefore, be in use relatively soon, quite likely sooner than the vaccine. Speaking of the vaccine...

-[The first patients to receive a Coronavirus vaccine were injected **today**!!!](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/coronavirus-vaccine-jennifer-haller-seattle-first-patient-injected-with-covid-19-shot-in-clinical-trial-cure/) Of course, this is an early step, clinical trials won’t be done for a while still, but this is a major milestone and, if all goes well with this, we should be very well on our way to getting the vaccine in circulation relatively soon! According to Dr. Fauci, these phase one trials began with record speed. 

I want to clarify “high-risk” populations. First of all, I want to apologize just in case I’ve ever indicated to anyone that someone who is “high-risk” is in any way doomed, or if you’ve ever felt like the discussion of “high-risk” people feels a bit… cold, like the high-risk folks don’t matter as much as the general population. 

What we need to remember is that the term “high-risk” encompasses a spectrum- not everyone in the high-risk category is equally at-risk. For example- a 90 year old smoker vs. an 80 year old never-smoker. Both are high risk. One is clearly high*er* risk. 

Additionally, highest risk tends to encompass those with *untreated* underlying conditions. If you have diabetes or hypertension, but you monitor that condition and follow your treatment plan, your risk is significantly minimized. It’s when these conditions become *uncontrolled* that the risk develops. So- if you’re reading this and you have one of those conditions, or something similarly risky, your diagnosis is *not* a death sentence. Just follow your treatment plan and your risk is minimized. 

If you have asthma (like me!), COPD, or severe allergies, don’t fear- nothing has conclusively proven those to be significant risk factors and in fact, [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32077115/) reports that those conditions are *”not risk factors”*. 

This feels scary because it feels uncontrollable, but what we fail to remember is that it **is** controllable. The WHO has stated that this is the first pandemic to ever be containable. But in order to do that, the most power is *in our hands*. This isn’t out of our control. This is fought with logic, with reason, with rationality. It’s fought with science and facts. It’s fought with actions that *you* can take *right now.*

Flatten the curve! Stay the fuck home! Wash your hands! Do everything you can do to fight this. Spread the word. We *can* and we *will* fight this. We *will* get through this, together. Remember to be alert, not anxious. This is not the end of the world. We won’t let it be. We’ve survived everything we’ve ever been through, and we **will** survive this too. 

As always, take the optimism, take the good news, and use it as momentum to move forward. We’ve got this, guys. It’s going to be alright. I love you all and I will see you again tomorrow. 

In case you need more momentum, here’s my [post from yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fkpi8jv)- links to all the old ones are at the bottom of that one.

Hello again to everyone! Let’s just jump straight into this good news stuff today, shall we? I’ve got a *lot* of awesome stuff to cover so no prelude rambling from me this time. 

-First off, in addition to drugs such as remdesivir (currently in trials), [another potential treatment for the virus has been found!](https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmNcF4usFUJdGjTMtEXT1XAYybJvtLmEjaZnvNXN2n91Zh/) This drug has been in use since 1945 to treat malaria, and shows promise as a suitable antiviral to fight COVID-19. The authors of the study state that it can result in “faster time to recovery and shorter hospital stay(s)”. The more treatments we have in testing, the better!

-[Here is an article](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-outbreak-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-death-rate) which (despite its somewhat evocative headline) goes into detail on explaining the potential death rate of the virus using the Diamond Princess cruise ship as a study. Essentially, those were perfect conditions for the virus to wreak the most havoc. The ship was mostly full of older people, they were in close proximity to each other, all breathing the same air... if a virus was going to spread anywhere, it’d be there. *AND YET*... the death rate is 0.5 percent on that ship. This article postulates that this may help us more accurately pin down what we may expect the death rate to actually be. In other words, according to these folks, we can expect the death rate to maybe plane closer to 0.5 percent... obviously significantly lower than the current 3.4 percent. 

-[More good news from the Diamond Princess!](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200316_10/amp.html) According to this article, the last group of patients on board the ship have recovered and are now able to go home- I believe this is just those still in Tokyo, but still, awesome news! 

-[Here’s an article](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fji8x6/200305003_high_temperature_and_high_humidity/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) from Cornell which indicates that our hopes may not be invalid- the virus seems to struggle to spread under high heat and humidity! In other words- when summer rolls around in the northern hemisphere, the rate of infection is expected to slow. Slower rate of infection means less burden on hospitals means a higher survival rate! Oh, and just in case that wasn’t enough? [Here’s a different study with similar findings, bam!](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034728v1)

-Let’s go just a bit deeper on the expected case fatality rate. I’m going to provide three links. As a nerd, I [really loved this one, first.](https://coronawiki.org/page/new-coronavirus-why-its-so-deadly-in-italy) This article goes into depth on Italy vs. South Korea, and the reason why S.K. is showing such a low case fatality rate (currently 0.98%) while Italy’s is so much higher. I’ll pull out the two most crucial parts: first, Italy has a significantly higher average age when compared to South Korea (and even most other countries in general). This raises a question: is Italy the outlier, or is S.K.? The answer the article came to is that S.K. is *likely to be more indicative of the global case fatality rate*, and therefore, this places the final, actual CFR *around one percent*. Not 3.4 percent. Not 8 percent. **One percent.** 

Further evidence on that last point, [here is an article on why the case fatality rate will probably turn out to be lower.](https://slate.com/technology/2020/03/coronavirus-mortality-rate-lower-than-we-think.html) Don’t worry, if you clicked that link and saw the update at the top of the page, I’m going to talk about it in a bit. 

Oh... [one more study](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-17453/v1) that puts us around that 1 percent mark- this one actually estimates the CFR to be lower than currently reported for *all* groups, including the elderly!

-[Here is a fantastic study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fped.2020.00104/full) which indicates that pregnant mothers, infected with the virus, can *not* transmit the illness to the baby while she’s pregnant!

I love the science but that’s not all you need, I’m sure. Let’s rapid-fire through just a small handful of other great things I saw today.

-[Mitt Romney may be a conservative](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/487794-romney-proposes-sending-1000-to-every-american-adult-amid-coronavirus?fbclid=IwAR2aZJA5E5PdjtQZxGeJCO6und-klNzilV-9Jae78x_zdjnhT-mk0aY9XOk), but even he knows the necessity to keep Americans paid during this time. He proposed that all Americans get $1000 this month to help us get through it, and if *he’s* saying it, well... he’s going to have a lot of support getting that to go through, on both sides of the aisle. 

-[The owner of Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/taco-bells-owner-will-pay-workers-during-coronavirus-closures) plans on paying workers through the closings of the restaurants! According to the article, both McDonald’s and Starbucks have similar plans as well. 

-[Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have been released from the hospital! They’ve fully recovered!](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/03/16/entertainment/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-released-hospital-coronavirus/index.html) Like many people smarter than myself have said, now including this couple, “take it one day at a time”. Additionally, they reported that their symptoms were pretty mild. 

-[For my U.K. friends](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/03/16/europe/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-response-ramped-up/index.html), Boris Johnson announced today that they are changing their strategy from the old one to one which more closely resembles what the rest of the world is doing. Expect to see more good news, policies, and plans to start rolling out this week. 

-The trend continues to rise! [Worldometer once again reports](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) another uptick in the mild cases- we are now up to **94% mild!!** Even for all my optimism, I’m shocked to see this trend continue in such a positive way. 

Ugh, guys... I need you to believe me on this but I have seen just *so much freakin great news today* on this whole thing. I *promise* I have more to share but as you can tell... this thing is long enough as it is. I had a whole lot planned to write on the underlying conditions and high-risk populations, testing too, and most importantly I felt I *really* need to talk about staying home and social isolation... but this is probably pushing the character limit as it is already. I think tomorrow morning I’m just literally going to bullet point the good news to the best of my ability rather than explaining every one in detail- but don’t worry, I’m still going to do that too for my main posts like this. 

When you’re done with this post, I want you to soak up every bit of optimism I’ve tried to give you. I want you to use that optimism as a boost of momentum to get your day going and keep on moving forward with whatever needs to be done. Keep your heads high everyone. Stay the fuck home. Wash your hands. Love you all so much and I will see you tomorrow.

Anxiety,fkmlxvj,t1_fkmi5nq,1584332460.0,"Thank you so much, it means a lot to hear you say that, I am glad I was able to help a bit :)"
Anxiety,fkmlqq6,t1_fkmk9bo,1584332305.0,"I’ve been posting several more of these since this one came out- if you’d like to read through those, you might get to feeling a bit better. 

I would be surprised if you have it, simply because the chances are still pretty low right now. It is cold and flu season entering allergy season, so your chances are still higher of dealing with one of those right now. 

That being said, because I’m not a doctor, if it gets worse or doesn’t get better in the next couple of days, I highly recommend you call either your general care practitioner, a local hospital, or whatever emergency hotline may be set up where you live. I recommend you google your state/country, and the phrase “Coronavirus screening” to see what your area recommends you do. I also recommend you stay away from people to the best of your ability during that time. Again, I do doubt that that’s what it is, but it’s not a bad idea to get checked out *just in case*- but only start worrying about that kind of thing if symptoms get worse or don’t improve after a day or two. 

Regardless of what it is, you’re going to want to get checked out and get treated if it gets worse or doesn’t improve, so literally everything I just said (barring the search for Coronavirus screening) would apply to *any* illness you could have. These are guidelines for basically any virus. 

Remember that anxiety can really trigger a lot of psychosomatic reactions as well. For this reason, I highly encourage you use the good vibes from my posts and other posts here, get a bit of positive momentum behind you, and then stay off the internet for the next couple of days. Do everything in your power to get calmed down. When you are, when you’re thinking rationally, if you still feel like you have symptoms, contact whoever you need to contact to get checked out. 

Everything I said above comes from general government and doctor guidelines- not from me. Unfortunately, I don’t feel comfortable providing any specific medical advice. I truly wish you the best in the coming days, weeks, months, etc.- if you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will answer to the best of my ability."
Anxiety,fkmhi48,t1_fkmbqur,1584329171.0,"Hey, awesome! I’m so glad to hear that you got something out of this, thank you for your comment!

Regarding the airports- yeah, there’s been a lot of people coming in from overseas and your concern is a valid one. That being said, we can take solace in knowing that they had their reasons for making the decision when they did, and this *will* help cut down on the spread of the virus. 

Now, regarding the lockdown. To the best of my knowledge, that rumor probably came from a statement made by Dr. Fauci today (the guy in charge of fighting this thing in the States) in an interview. The interviewer asked him if he would like to see a “national lockdown” (her words) on *restaurants and bars* specifically. He said that he might want to institute something like that, if that’s what it took to see a limitation on interactions in those locations. I’d link the article if I wasn’t concerned that the wording might be triggering for some people. It was on CNN, if anyone wants to find it, but do so with caution. 

Note the way that the interviewer frames that question. *She* used the phrase “national lockdown”. Dr. Fauci did *not* say those words. He said if that’s what it took, it’s not off the table, and *this is only in regards to closing restaurants and bars*, it’s not even talking about something as extreme as what Italy is doing, and Italy isn’t even doing anything horrifically extreme anyways. 

However, because Fauci didn’t immediately shoot her down, they were able to write an article with a headline saying that Fauci was considering a “national lockdown”. Note the phrasing, note the way it’s being used. It makes things look so much scarier than it actually is right now. 

If I’m wrong, and the rumor is either coming from something else or is entirely made up, don’t worry about it. If a lockdown happens, it’ll be similar to Italy as a *worst case scenario* and probably won’t even be that bad. And keep in mind- Italy is doing fine right now. The average citizen is still able to go outside, go to the store, etc, etc. Everything’s fine over there. I highly doubt that happens here, but if it does, it won’t even be that awful. This being said, I’m almost *certain* that that’s not what the Redditor was referencing- I’d put money on it being a misinterpretation of Fauci’s statements today. 

Hope that helped a bit more!"
Anxiety,fkmge5s,t1_fkm6ihg,1584328383.0,"Thank you so much!

I’m doing my best to not get burned out- I don’t comment nearly as frequently as I was for a while, for instance. I’m not really worried about that at the moment, but I’ll be sure to let everyone know if I plan on taking a day off, *if* that happens. I’m definitely not going anywhere though! The frequency of my updates honestly just depends on the frequency of news coming out that I feel good about sharing. If there’s a lot, I’ll post a lot. If there’s not, I’ll still try my best to post daily, just might not always be as extensive or as up-to-date as my first few. 

Thank you again for the compliments and the concern!"
Anxiety,fkm537o,t1_fkm3hbn,1584321239.0,"My best educated *guess*? I don’t know for sure so I don’t want to say anything with certainty, but...

I don’t think it has much, if anything, to do with mutation yet. Maybe a bit. I do think we’ll see a less lethal strain mutate soon though. I think the main reason we’re seeing more mild cases for a plethora of reasons. One is because of effective treatments. 

My main guess is, though, that most cases just were never that bad to begin with in the average person. We’re just starting to get more tests and more confirmations from those mild/asymptomatic patients. Think about it: many people who got it weren’t that sick, so they never went to the doctor, so they never got tested, because they didn’t *need* it. Now that more tests are being done, it’s just being caught more in those cases."

Anxiety,fklptov,t1_fkijgb0,1584311927.0,"Sure thing! Sorry for the delay, truly, been a crazy day for me. Here’s some good stuff from those!

**Article one:**

Nearly half of those cases have recovered and those people are now back to their normal lives. 

One of those who tested positive and has since recovered is an East Tennessee woman who was quarantined on a cruise ship in Japan with her husband. 

Jeanie and Arnold Hopland are now back home after spending weeks in quarantine overseas. 

At the end of January, the Hopland's set sail on an overseas cruise. 

On the last day of the trip in early February, someone on board tested positive for the coronavirus, which led to hem being quarantined for weeks. 

It was a long journey back home, but they want people to know you can recover.

Jeanie is just one of more than 70,000 people that has recovered from COVID-19. 

At 74 she said she's healthy and never had a respiratory virus before. She describes her covid19 symptoms as mild. 

""I had a cough, a little sneeze,"" she said. 

So mild, she barely realized she was sick.

 ""It didn't stop me from doing what I was doing. I was going every place we went, enjoying it and that's the sickest I got,"" Jeanie said. 

After weeks away she's finally back to her normal life. 

""Yesterday I was out weeding and I thought just being outside is a pleasure,"" she said. 

Jeanie also said don't panic if you test positive, but urges people to be careful of passing it along to someone who may not be able to fight it off. ""Don't fear getting the disease if you're healthy. Worry if you need to keep someone protected, if you have an elderly person in your home or are going to visit them often think about that but don't worry for yourself, don't worry.""

**And article two:**

A 55-year-old man from the Warren area is starting to recover from the coronavirus and says he now wants to share his identity and story in an effort to help relieve fear.

“At first, I felt like I was going to die, but now it’s slowly getting better,” Harris said.  

He told the Fox 8 I-Team that Friday he finally was able to sleep through the night.

Harris posted a video on his social media page Friday night showing himself in his hospital bed and a hospital worker next to his bed wearing protective gear.

“I had to wait and make sure I wasn’t going to die before I was on Facebook,” Harris says on the video. “I am not out of the woods but I am better.”

He says he is very grateful to the hospital staff that has helped him."
