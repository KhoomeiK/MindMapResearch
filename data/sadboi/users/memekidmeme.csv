piano,fpuchzn,t3_gf9njv,1588909581.0,I recommend practicing hitting 3-5 notes with one hand and try to make the keys as far away as possible from each other. After doing that for a bit your hands will stretch. I've been playing piano for 8months. I started learning Gymnopedie no.1 a month ago. When I started I barely hit 4 notes with the same hand. After practicing them it feels easy and I can feel that my hand has stretched.
