smallbusiness,fqo2wx7,t3_gjxch0,1589506472.0,Yup! Worked at a flower shop where this guy would always call and we wouldnâ€™t even answer because we had caller ID. Well sometimes heâ€™s get mad and leave voicemails saying he knew we were there. The guy memorized our names and all kinda creepy.

I canâ€™t even imagine the pain youâ€™re going through.  But the way you described Honey is so beautiful she mustâ€™ve truly been an Angel who impacted many lives. A love like that not many people find in this lifetime so Iâ€™m glad you two had each other for so many years. You probably wonâ€™t ever get over it, but what would Honey want you to do? How would she want you to honor her life?

Maybe by continuing her legacy and helping people showing the same compassion she had for others.  I would suggest journaling through this."

I think thatâ€™s a good way to start! :)"

EntrepreneurRideAlong,ffpti2m,t3_eudkj4,1580105122.0,You are doing than most people feel proud of yourself! On Halloween 2019 after I left a club there was a man selling hot dogs outside no cart. Made small talk and turns out he was at another public event and sold 80+ in a couple of hours. Donâ€™t be discouraged !

NativeAmerican,f8uroog,t3_cqzj5o,1574840907.0,Found this kind of late! My parents speak PurhÃ©pecha and growing up i learned to understand most words but never speak it. Their music is so beautiful!! Even though I could never understand what they sang which is odd because I understood the language never the singing.
