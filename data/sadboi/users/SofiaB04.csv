BPD,fnuclee,t3_g3wkpd,1587259156.0,"I met my SO a partial hospitalization program. We started dating while in the program and we were strongly advised against it, for all the reasons you mentioned. They were concerned I wasn't stable enough to be in a relationship at all, especially not with someone else struggling with mental illness. They warned that we could develop a co-dependant relationship and be detrimental to each other's progress. They worried about what would happen if one of us got better and the other didn't. 

I was of course stubborn and didn't listen, and we are still together 2 and a half years later, and we are both doing pretty well. But those were all very valid concerns, and we have had some pretty dark times.  I feel like overall the relationship has been good for both of us."
BPD,fnnqkqa,t3_g267jl,1587098897.0,"I agree with you. I'm older but when I was in my teens and early 20's (early days of the internet, lol) I spent a lot of time on BPD message boards, eating disorder boards, self-injury boards, etc.. It was helpful at times, but I feel like it almost became my identity. I actually found myself taking on the characteristics of other people posting on those sites. It wasn't until I kinda stepped away from those sites and stopped reading so much about mental illness that I was able to start getting out of that spiral. I still am a person with BPD, but I'm not ""just that"", if that makes any sense. 

I do wish there was a sub that was more recovery based, maybe with older people or those further along in recovery."

I am currently drinking about 2-3 bottles of wine a night, but am able to not drink during the day. I would be very surprised if I don't already have severe liver damage. At this level it would not be safe for me to stop cold turkey without an inpatient medical detox. I am 37 and do not expect I will live past 40 at this point.  Self medicating with alcohol has literally ruined my life.

He is usually the one validating how I feel. We got in a stupid fight last night about politics of all things. He hates politics, and he is very smart. My sister and I were discussing the impeachment and he just went off and started yelling and shaking his fists and saying we have no idea what we are talking about. I've seen him have rages before, but it is usually at people he is playing video games with. He did this in front of my 3 nieces and my sister, who ended up leaving shortly after because they were so uncomfortable. I held it together until they left but then broke down sobbing I was so angry at him. He knows that anyone yelling is a huge trigger for me. But then he acted like he had no idea what I was upset about. I was so angry that he scared my nieces and my sister probably won't bring them over again. When he started yelling and I could tell he was about to lose it I told him he was right and I kept trying to change the subject, but he wouldn't let it go. I told him after they left that he was yelling and shaking his fists, he said he wasn't yelling, that he could show me yelling, ""the fucking walls would shake"". I was really upset and just kept screaming ""fuck you"" at him because I couldn't find any other words.  I stormed out of the apartment and sat in my car for an hour until I could calm down enough to come in. Then he hugged me and calmed me down like he always does when I overreact to something. He told me everything was okay and we made up. I apologized for cursing at him, he said it's okay he can handle it. But he still doesn't think he did anything wrong.

I know at this point the fact that I am still upset is an overreaction. But he is my best friend, the person I trust more than anyone, and I can't shake the way that I felt when he treated me like one of his video game friends.

I do agree with the idea of accusations not being made public until their is a conviction, but I don't see that happening. My problem is I don't know what the solution is. I don't want women to feel afraid of coming forward when they have been raped, I don't want them to be shamed or feel threatened. On the other hand I don't want anyone to be punished for a crime they really didn't commit. There is no other crime that so often comes down to one person's word against another's.

In a culture where all it takes is the accusation of a crime to be convicted in the court of public opinion, because ""women don't lie"", it's frightening.  Kobe Bryant was never convicted of rape, despite what people claim he never confessed to rape, but immediately following his death people came out of the woodwork calling him a rapist and saying he got what he deserved. When it comes to rape, especially for black and brown men, they are not innocent until proven guilty and that is frightening. 

For the record, I have been raped twice in my life. I am not a rape apologist, although I have been called one before. I think anyone who is rightfully convicted of rape should die a very slow and painful death in prison. I also don't think anyone who says they are a victim of rape should be shamed or accused of lying. I just think there needs to be actual evidence of guilt before condemning a person, and it should never come down to ""he said/she said""."

This person I know was accused by his wife of raping her, there was zero evidence other than her word, he was charged and spent 3 months in jail before even being tried. He was told by his attorney that since there was no physical evidence, if it went to trial it would be his word against hers, and he had a 50/50 chance of going to prison for 20 years if he didn't take a plea deal and plead guilty in exchange for 3 years house arrest. He lost his career and will have to register as a sex offender for life. Funny side note, as a condition of his probation he had to take a polygraph test and passed, but since he already pled guilty and polygraphers aren't admissible in court guess it doesn't matter.

Looking back, while my manager wasn't perfect he really was trying to help and was extremely patient with me, even forgiving an unexplained 2 week absence when I was hospitalized. I am doing better now and sometimes think about going back to apologize, but I doubt he even remembers me and it would probably just end up being really awkward. But a lot of times apologizing to get closure can be beneficial to out own healing. 

As for the job front, you don't mention what field you were in, but it's definitely possible to get an entry level minimum wage job somewhere. Most restaurants and fast food places don't even check references.

You had no idea that he was suffering so much with panic attacks when he started, if you had known maybe you would have treated him differently. Honestly even if he wasn't dealing with that you had no reason to treat him that way for trying to do his job. When he first started trying to change systems you put in place, did you calmly and respectfully explain why the systems are the way they are, or did you just pitch a fit? Always try to put yourself in other people's shoes, you never know what they are going through in their lives."
BPD,fg2zuv8,t1_fg2r862,1580463602.0,"It is not up to you to decide what is or isn't abuse, and it is inappropriate to invalidate another person's experience that you have no knowledge of. I'm sorry that you seem to have had a bad experience with an ex who happens to have BPD, but it is unfair to generalize that all people with BPD behave the same way."

BPD,fg2vskg,t1_fg2ustm,1580458034.0,"Yeah, I've read pretty much every book about it, I also have it. The statement you made that it is the dynamic of dating someone with BPD makes it sound like that is just to be expected. It can be A dynamic for some people with BPD, but it isn't fair to generalize like that."
BPD,fg2unxt,t1_fg2gnm9,1580456649.0,"No, that is not the dynamic of dating someone with BPD, that is the dynamic of dating someone not yet healthy enough to be in a relationship. There are many many people with BPD who are capable of not being abusive to their mates. BPD makes interpersonal relationships more difficult, it is not an excuse to be be abusive.

OP, you really seem to care about this person, it is admirable that you are so dedicated to making them happy. But it won't work if you are constantly walking in eggshells and are the only one trying to make this work. You should not have to live in fear of accidently saying or doing the wrong thing, or God forbid not immediately answering a phone call. You need to set some boundaries and have an honest conversation with this person."
BPD,ffvaxrb,t3_evdazh,1580259833.0,"I don't consider my parents abusive. I think they were neglectful due to their own mental illness, addiction and financial situation. My Mom also had BPD and bipolar disorder, so I would never call her manipulative because I don't think it was intentional. I think they did the best they could, they just shouldn't have had kids."
BPD,ffva605,t3_evbfiv,1580259318.0,"If it is a possibility, I would strongly recommend a partial hospitalization program as opposed to inpatient treatment unless you are a immediate risk to yourself. In PHP you spend the day in the hospital getting structured treatment, but go home at night. In mine it was from 9-3 every weekday, and I was there for 2 months. In the morning sessions we would have group therapy and some instructional lessons, and then in the afternoon it was either arts and crafts, a movie, or games. You also met with your psychiatrist at least once a week, and had an individual therapy session with your social worker twice a week. I found it really beneficial. 

When I did inpatient treatment at the same hospital, It was kinda terrible. It was much less structured and more about keeping you safe from yourself than from actually getting better. There was supposed to be group therapy, but it was usually just a 15 minute check in, and they didn't even have it everyday. The rest of the time you were just kinda sitting around waiting for bed time. I actually ended up having a psychotic break while I was in the hospital due to the stress and boredom, and they ended up keeping me an extra 2 weeks because of it. I do think I needed to be there because it did prevent me from harming myself while I was there, but there wasn't any actual treatment."

I don't really care if there is only a 7% chance that this person will hurt another child, that is still more of a chance than an average person molesting a child. And I'm sorry, it isn't just ""a mistake"", it is a decision that was made that results in a lifetime of pain for another person.

I know you love him and think you know him, but it has only been 6 months. He wasn't honest to begin with, and what he did tell you was only because he was legally required to?

When I told my psychiatrist all the reasons why I thought BPD might not be correct, he told me that all he cared about was finding a treatment that worked for me, the diagnosis is mostly just for insurance purposes anyway. If you start treatment for bpd and it helps you, it doesn't matter if the diagnosis is correct or not. I think people get too caught up in fitting a diagnosis."

If their argument is abortion is murder, it doesn't make it any less murder if the pregnancy was a result of rape. That throws the whole argument out the window.

I wasn't able to start questioning things when I was 15 because I didn't want to go to hell, I honestly 100% believed that life began at conception, and that to have an abortion at any stage of pregnancy was murder. It wasn't until I was in my 20s that I started developing a sense of self and was able to start questioning things I had always believed. If that means I have weak moral character to you, so be it. 

OP would be a hypocrite if she was anti-abortion, got pregnant, decided she could have an abortion, but still maintained her anti-choice stance. I don't think changing your ways, regardless of the reasoning, makes you a hypocrite or worthy of all of this judgement and hate."
