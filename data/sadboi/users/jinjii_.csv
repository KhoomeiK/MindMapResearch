In my experience, I’ve only ever bought fake carts (including TKOs) and I have yet to have a bad reaction. Went to the doctors recently and they said my lungs sounded fine. I’d say just play it safe and pay close attention to how you feel as you’re hitting it"

I’m assuming that since ADHD  meds are similar to meth she was acting in a way that a meth head would when they don’t have any drugs. Meth heads are known to do ANYTHING to get a fix. This includes stealing from family members and friends, no matter their relationship to the person. I hope she gets help, good luck to you and her."

But I’m doing alright now even though the depression is still lingering. Physically eh I haven’t noticed much of a difference. Not sure if this says anything but I’ve been using carts for about a year now and I still will have a coughing fit if I take too big of a hit. I smoke pretty much everyday so I find it a bit weird. Sorry if I’m being too talkative lol my adderall kinda does that

Straight up took me like 10 minutes of just laying in my bed staring at the ceiling hoping to god I down puke to recover. Not fun. And don’t get me started on the sweating holy fuck.."

ADHD,ersgaxx,t1_errwred,1561213166.0,"Holy crap I’ve never related to something more. In my room is a drafting table that I never use, and in that drafting table? At least 5 completely empty sketchbooks and paintbrushes I bought on a whim but have only actually used once or twice. Luckily school seems to be the only place where I can actually get anything done. Although I have mostly unfinished pieces in my portfolio, I actually completed a few. Even in my core classes I find myself doodling all over my papers, but when it comes time to actually take out my sketchbook and begin to make some art, I just can’t do it. The rare times that I’ve been able force myself to do it I always draw something basic that never gets past the sketch phase because I’m not happy enough with what might be the final outcome. Is there any way to make myself sit down and draw? I love making art but I can’t get myself to practice."
