lonely,f9vpszq,t3_e7187p,1575676523.0,I have friends but I’m lonely in a sense that I can’t find people who think philosophically like me. It’s kinda boring to meet people who don’t provoke my thought. Hence my loneliness.
lonely,f9vpjei,t3_e6vrxq,1575676325.0,Lol I’m 20 and I always think about what it is like in heaven (not suicideal just curious). I always wonder”is it a monarchy up there” or “are there npcs living among us” although I ask these questions and none of my friends relate I guess it can still work out.
depression,f7esmgx,t3_dvpxiq,1573664917.0,I’m not religious but I think deep a lot. What if it’s not over after dying and u actually get punished for it. Well at least that is my take. I’d rather not force my way into the unknown.

depression,f62y7qj,t3_dck8hr,1572668805.0,"I used to get depressed from shit like this and I always had a fascination about magic, battles, and having my own kingdom. But I’m mostly happy now because luckily I found someone to teach me magic. Not that fake shit like getting sawed in half and crap but things much more realistic. Stuff like this was practiced in ancient times so the only reason we as a society think it doesn’t exist is because of mob mentality. I never believe anything until I see things with my own eyes as well so I’m a hypocrite."
