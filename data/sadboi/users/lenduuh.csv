Austin,fi7415d,t1_fi73vvy,1582213841.0,How is that entitled? I lived on $11K a year in 2014 and on $36K for two years after that. Entitled are those who regardless of personal experience think this is a dignified wage. It is not.
Austin,fi73vvy,t1_fi73tzc,1582213756.0,I did that last year too.
Austin,fi73ct0,t3_f6unbx,1582213434.0,"It depends--if you are a single person with no other responsibility but themselves, have no chronic medical conditions or family obligations, then it is tight but you can make it work. If you have any sort of debt--be it student loans or a car payment this is going to make it harder on you. 

Whoever tells you that this is a livable wage has clearly not lived on $35K anytime after 2015."

povertyfinance,fhexnzm,t3_f2ntd1,1581532015.0,"When I moved up in my money game my fiance mentioned that a lot of my meals were composed of rice, starches, and very little meat. It never dawned on me it was because it is a really cheap and effective way to feed a lot of people. For me it was just how I ate and that was it. I will never stop eating rice though."
studentaffairs,fgn4jg1,t1_fgj0u4x,1580937570.0,We tried to unionize at my school and the dean went to one of my colleague's supervisors and intimidated the hell out of her. We dropped it after that because we (rightfully) feared retaliation.
Austin,fdnd9d4,t3_elz9u6,1578583321.0,"I heard about this story too as a kid, but I was living in another country so safe to say this might be an urban legend."
Anxiety,fdm6an8,t3_em0e7a,1578540840.0,I don't know if it's related but when I clench my jaw a lot I get horrible ear pain. Sometimes I get cramps in my jaw muscles and it's so uncomfortable.
Austin,fcrwiob,t3_ei738b,1577907586.0,"I personally prefer Michi, Tatsu-ya was okay but my first ever bowl of ramen was at Michi so perhaps I'm just sentimental."
studentaffairs,fbwpuv9,t3_ees78d,1577156256.0,I personally recommend waiting until you hit the PhD wall (dean and the like) and start there. Experience in education is so valuable before embarking into a 5-7 year field trip of poverty and publications.
namenerds,fbdtz07,t3_ectk11,1576771278.0,Arturo and Trinidad are Spanish but not as common for younger children as it was a couple of decades ago. Iker and Bastian are Basque so I have a feeling there are some Basque folks in the Colorado area!
namenerds,fbdtvzu,t1_fbdpiau,1576771224.0,I think it's Basque!
AskReddit,fbc8y9p,t3_eccwli,1576718503.0,"Well for one, being able to let them pursue hobbies like ballet and writing, since I could never afford that as a kid. Not have their career tied to hard skills because need to get out of poverty but a career you truly enjoy."
AskReddit,fajcv46,t3_e98jnm,1576132176.0,I had watched a movie when I was younger kind of like Suspiria but the headmistress was quadraplegic and spoke with a machine. Anyway any ballet student who was the star at any given moment was murdered.

HigherEd,f807pue,t1_f5yf3xd,1574122413.0,"I do think it might be excessive since given the title the OP provides this is an entry level or mid-level position at best. Unless they are paying them director/VP/AVP level, I don't see why having 3-4 interviews for ""fit"" when we all know it's just an excrutiating audition for what might be a job that has a life of 2-3 years tops. 

I don't know about you, OP, but I would be wary of this institution."
BeautyGuruChatter,f6h23xc,t1_f6egybc,1572835261.0,That's what I'm treating this at too! I love and respect Lisa as an artist and of course I'm going to support this (within reason). I spent like $170 on five lipsticks and no regrets.
BeautyGuruChatter,f6h1u6o,t3_dr25nx,1572835081.0,"I got the Muse, Beauty, and Fawn Set as well as Ribbon and Jazz. I'm going to be giving Ribbon yo my mom and Beauty to my sister for the holidays. I have been wanting Jazz for so long and Muse and Fawn are no brainers for me tbh. So excited to finally have gotten an opportunity to purchase these!"

AskReddit,f27eo50,t3_dc9r0p,1570036532.0,I cut my father out of my life about 5 years ago and I don't regret it one bit. I still do get sappy every once in a while (I'm getting married and he is NOT giving me away...he wasn't happy about it either when he found out). I am a much happier person because although it is painful to mourn someone who is still very much alive my mental health and relationships with other folks have never been better. I cannot parent my own parent and it took me a long time to get it.

AskReddit,esz2vwq,t3_by8yf7,1562354190.0,There was a Chemistry & Physics teacher who sold chocolate bars at lunch in my middle school lmao. He also sold study guides to his own tests (he got caught but not fired).
LatinoPeopleTwitter,eovxuzh,t1_eok1wj2,1558902302.0,"I moved to the US when I was 15, so I think about this a lot. I got here in the cusp of adolescence and it sucked for a long time before it got better. I am still in touch with my friends back home and our lives are getting more and more different every year. I don't think I'd have this high of a quality of life had I stayed--even though we were not necessarily hurting financially. The drug war really did a number on my hometown--which was the main reason we left. I think about the career thing a lot; I work in a field that doesn't exist back home so I have no fuckin idea what I'd be doing."
