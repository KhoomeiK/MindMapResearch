depression,ffw7lgo,t3_enrs4c,1580288130.0,"I can feel you. I've been consciously suffering from bipolar disorder for ten years now. Never have I told anyone anything about my problems but my psychologist. I have always been to afraid of people's reactions. I was scared, they'd think I'd be making something out of nothing and simply seeking attention.
This is kind of thinking is normal when you're suffering from depression. Depression lies. It will always tell you that you're worth nothing and trigger your deepest fears.

It's been just this month that I'd been so low again that I got close to rock bottom again. But I took all the courage that was left in me and opened up to a friend who knew me through these past ten years. She returned so much support and love. I couldn't believe it. She gave me the power to open up to more people like my family and friends. No I have the love and support I need to get up and ask for help.
No one can tell you what you feel isn't real. If you feel it, it is real to you. And you alone will most likely ever really understand what you feel. But it is extremely important to open up to people who are important for you. No matter how often depression tells you you're a sick sad piece of shit, there is always someone who'll tell you different.
Go out there. Gather courage. Open up. It took me 10 years I should've used in a better way."
