BPD,fptbhsn,t1_fpszo1w,1588888230.0,"Well said, OP is getting extremely frustrated over people’s experiences which have nothing to do with her. 

Most people who interact with us, and almost all of them are completely oblivious to medical and psychology terms, don’t even know what BPD is to have such strong (and negative) opinion on the disorder, they will base their opinion on their interaction with us, instead. That’s why it’s always more advised to attach to treatment and recovery rather than having this or that. Not everyone lives inside this internet bubble, the world outside couldn’t give a bigger crap to the 5 out of 9 criteria, try explaining this to them and they’ll just go “ah okay... so you are bipolar then?” And there’s nothing wrong with that. At the end of the day **only your behavior and thoughts matters**, that’s why we must go past this childish obsession and focus on feeling better and creating a better life for ourselves. Little tip: complain over what strangers are doing doesn’t help.

My diagnosis did nothing for me for a long time cause I was still being treated by unprepared therapists and doctors. Big shit you have the F60.3 on your medical file if nobody knows what to do with it and you still suffer like hell.

OP sounds quite entitled and invalidating."
BPD,fpt5uu7,t3_gf94dg,1588885386.0,"I think that every person deals with their disorder the way it suits them better and I also think it’s none of our business. This argument “oh it harms our image” is just an excuse some use to attribute some level of importance and exclusivity to the F60.3, as if it’s somehow disturbing their *ego*. Learn to let go and let people be. At the end of the day people will base their opinion about us based on interaction with us rather than our diagnosis and how it’s generally viewed. Just try to be a nice person and commit to your recovery instead of getting fussed over what other people are doing with their (lack of) diagnosis, that’s a waste of time."

While we were together he was ALWAYS talking about how he would get me pregnant and then leave me (he would pay child support and take the kid to his town once a month), he would joke to my mother that I had my IUD removed and would physically restrain me from going to the bathroom after sex because “the little ones are going to stay there”.

I’m under a year into my fitness journey, I started in August/2019 and now who knows when I’ll be back at the gym (doing home workouts so far). I have always been skinny and my weight has always been around 54kg~55kg (119~121). I’ve struggled with an ED in the past and up to this day I can’t get myself to eat in large quantities (I stop when I’m full and that’s it). I also try to eat the best I can: trying to reach my macros (through supplements as well), avoiding sugar, industrialized food and fried stuff. My gym routine revolves around lifting and I do push myself to lift as heavy as I can (without impacting form and execution) although I don’t want to compete or anything like that, just build bigger muscles (top and bottom - actually I give more emphasis to chest and back or at least have more fun training them).

I do believe I need to give myself more time (and more food!)"

Now I say I’m in a better place for real, it’s a bit less exciting, it seems softer somehow, no peaks or valleys. I sure do have bad, awful days, but I can recognize my mind functioning on a new system, I see myself using skills and being way more mindful than I’ve ever been in life."

Sometimes someone does something minor and I catch myself on a “fuck ‘em” mindset throwing everything away, giving up on the relationship and basically disappearing. That’s clearly my BPD flaring up as a trauma response, not something I genuinely meant to do.

When someone disappears, I think that’s because I must’ve done something to trigger such a response on them too and start sulking, getting depressed and overthinking. I obsess over “I did something wrong and I’m a despicable human being” which is extremely unlikely since the other person doesn’t have BPD and their thought process is probably a regular one, this person might just not have enough time to talk to me.

BPD,fjl3tl1,t3_fdz8uo,1583439393.0,"I’ve mentioned before in another post: gather external perspective. And make this an exercise. Get some insight on what “normal” people consider unhealthy and unacceptable and from there start to rebuild your boundaries, check what’s common to not tolerate and see if it aligns with your opinions. What makes you feel uneasy? What makes you feel safe? There are some great worksheets about boundaries online. It requires training and practice, mindfulness, but as time passes it gets more instinctive.

I only realized how awfully my ex was treating me when I shared some incidents with friends, my therapist and reddit, they found pretty much everything unacceptable and couldn’t understand how and why I was putting up with his behavior in silence. I was so immersed in controlling my symptoms and trying to be the perfect girlfriend I ended up absolutely oblivious to what was really going down. Eventually my instinct got me out of that relationship, I acted out and he dropped me in a second as if I didn’t mean anything to him."
BPD,fjgagf3,t3_fd1tvn,1583319360.0,"My last relationship was very confusing to me, I felt like I was going insane shifting between “oh he really likes me and I’m overreacting” and “there’s no way he even respects me and sees me as a human being”. I held on for six months but eventually had a meltdown, he obviously dropped me and the relationship as if I had been a stranger in his life.

I spent months dwelling and taking full responsibility for the breakup and how he reacted because, of course, I was the “crazy” one in the relationship even though my symptoms were only shown that one time (although he had known about my BPD).

When I eventually shared what was going on in the relationship with neurotypical friends and with my new therapist, they were kinda horrified by some things he did to me and said they’d have never put up with them. Of course he wasn’t 100% terrible but if I was offered a bowl of M&M’s and some of them had been previously inside a butt would I still take the full bowl and eat them all? Definitely no.

My suggestion is: talk to friends/family and hear their perspective on your relationship. Would they tolerate that? Would they be okay with his behavior? It’ll be a good exercise of awareness, both on your behavior (so you can watch out and not let anything fester to the point of lashing out or fighting) and on a partner’s one (so you learn to recognize toxic behavior, set boundaries to filter what you’ll tolerate and what you won’t)."

The good parts were amazing, we were “together” for 6 months and although he never felt like defining our status I could say I loved him. We had adventures and a fun time together, he took me places and gave me gifts. 

On the other hand he clearly didn’t respect me nor see me as equal, he would often joke how he’d get me pregnant, dump me and pay me $200 as child support, tell me he’d dump me if I ever got fat, get angry if he got something I’d said wrong, be passive agressive, throw on my face I didn’t like him or I was lying when I said I missed him and so on. Hehas crossed very serious sexual boundaries to the point I started dissociating during sex. I was losing myself, I was losing my voice, I took it all without complaining. I was ashamed of who I was and my interests, I wanted to hide the real me and be perfect so he’d never leave me.

Long story short, at some point I was emotionally exhausted and couldn’t keep up that role so I blew up, I was tired of that confusion and trying to figure out whether he liked me or not. After this he said he never have nor would ever love me, he was just having a fun time with me and therefore the relationship was over.

I spent a month without eating, speaking or sleeping. I was in shock cause it was all so sudden and he discarded me to never talk to me again. It’s been 4 months now and the further I get from the situation I realized how damaging it was. My spirit was once again being crushed by a jerk.

I personally don’t see in a bad way or with shady intentions cause they’re not constant, we could go months without talking to each other until one of us send anything (65% him and 35% me). But I understand your point and since we’re so far away, there’s nothing much to do about it rather than cut contact alltogether."

The driving one pisses me off so much. I’m 26 and my mother keeps telling everyone how much of a terrible driver I am, how immature and inattentive I am. All of my cousins drive and have gotten their own car from my their parents, I’m still not allowed to even touch my mother’s. Every time someone else lets me drive their car they always tell my mother I’m actually quite okay behind the wheel and she should let me practice a bit, but she shuts them off by saying she doesn’t believe them. Oh, and my GC brother has already switched cars twice, the first one was given by my mother."

tarot,f4r9o3s,t3_dll14t,1571764710.0,"**Background**: We were together for a bit more than three years (2013-2016) and a big part of it was long-distance since I’m brazilian and he’s swiss but we managed to live together for 8 months in this period. We met while I was living in Poland and we both were on vacation in Amsterdam. You know that movie *Before Sunrise*? Yeah, that’s almost exactly how it happened and after I visited him in his country we were officially together. 

Fast forward to 2016, we were on a crossroads. He had just visited me, he said I couldn’t visit him in July and also didn’t know if he could come back next year, there I lost all hope and together with my mental state deteriorating and undiagnosed/untreated disorder getting worse I simply gave up on everything we had, I knew I couldn’t take that situation any longer. 

During our time apart we ocasionally talked and on very good terms, remembering old jokes or talking about football transfers and the World Cup. Not to mention (possibly) drunken messages in which he said he would travel around South America and would love to see me, although it hasn’t happened so far. This weekend he messaged me a photo of the hostel where we met asking me if I recognized it, he said he was just there drinking for the sake of old times. And that’s it."
tarot,f4r9kri,t3_dll14t,1571764678.0,"**Reading**: I’m using the Rider Waite deck and I’ve used the Biddy Tarot Celtic Cross Spread as a guide. 

I’ve asked for some clearance on this situation, so I could determine which action to take (including no action and letting the past rest).

1 - The present: For me the Page of Swords deals with communication but seems like he’s withholding it, as if he’s keeping a secret. I’ve never mentioned to my ex how I truly feel about everything and since I was the one breaking up I’ve always felt it wouldn’t be fair, so I just let things be.

2 - The challenge: The Knight of Cups represents that almost unrealistic emotions. He’s across the ocean from me, what I feel is not really compatible to the possibility of things actually happening.

3 - Past: Well, I broke up because I couldn’t take all the difficulties that come with a long distance relationship much longer. The burden had become too much. Instead of hanging on, like the Ten of Swords, I gave up.

4 - Future: The Three of Cups represents a friendship for me. Nothing very romantic, unfortunately.

5 - Above: I feel bad for the breakup and sometimes see myself as the bad one, as if I wanted to leave the relationship as the “victorious” one, before my ex managed to break up with me (seemed inevitable). I see myself in the Five of Swords and that’s why I haven’t done anything about us.

6 - Below: The Knight of Wands represents what I currently want but this feeling might not last.

7 - Advice: A new journey might be approaching, or even some news related to foreign lands (my ex or the quest I’m in for a dual citizenship granted by my antecessors) are represented by the Page of Wands. I can’t clearly see what would the advice be.

8 - External Influences: I’m subject to rejection on my ex’s part since it was a relationship and it’s been long over. And I can see this completion (and negativity) in the Ten of Swords.

9 - Hopes and Fears: I have no clue what to think of the High Priestess in this position.

10 - Outcome: The Magician suggests the beginning of something new. Rekindling an old flame wouldn’t be something *exactly* new, but would be a start anyway.

It seems funny the amount of Wands that appeared, giving the travelling nature of the suite.

Any input? I don’t do readings very often so I might have left something out."

But I’m afraid if I come forward she’ll be like “well why do you think it’s about you? do you use drugs?”, like throwing a bait to get the truth from me. At this point of my life I realized I don’t know her and I cannot predict her next moves. I fear doing anything that might stir up drama."

Right after he discarded me I saw him waving his brand new Magnum .357 around in social media while displaying no trigger discipline (cause he’s as dumb as a door) and being super happy with beers and women.

When he met my brother’s friends, who aren’t interested in guns, he just kept talking about them, how they work and which guns he “used to have”, meanwhile I was just listening and cringing because the guys were getting either uninterested or uncomfortable.

Once he told me that when he was in high school, back in the 90s, he took a gun to school to ward off his bullies as if he was telling me about a walk he took in the park. All his life stories somehow involved guns, punching people or something similarly questionable/illegal.

And I thought I was the mentally unstable one."

I’ve had a few bad ones. The worse was one in which my (also narc) mother was setting him up with some girls just so both could shove it in my face how awful I am and how happier he is now that he left. But then I had two meaningful ones. In the first I was in his town, he saw me and I refused to talk to him, saying that I no longer needed that in my life. In the last one I was again in his town (although this time no sign of him) and my family gathered for a dinner in a restaurant, I was there with my new boyfriend: Nick fucking Cave. I woke up laughing.

Yeah, it’s a silly example, I know. But it’s nice to witness our subconscious getting rid of all the trash the Narc left in our brains. Don’t worry, your mind is slowly doing its job!"
