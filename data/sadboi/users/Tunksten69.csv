kratom,fq0d3c1,t3_g0r0na,1589030224.0,"Sometimes I take a small dose of unsubscribed ritalin. I know it's an unresponsible thing to do, but I also know I sometimes have a really hard time concentrating and it works for me. I will be asking my therapist if I can take an ADD test, because I've struggled with this for a long time. But to make it even more unresponsible, I sometimes mix it with a small dose of red kratom. So far it feels like a good combination, although in the peak in can be a bit intense and my head feels light. I think it's always good to be carefull, so take a small dose a few hours after the ritalin. Also, when I'm working, I sometimes forget to take a break or to eat and drink. This maybe because I take unprescribed drugs, but I heard some people who take prescribed ritalin who also struggle with this. I think planning a break and making sure you drink and eat enough is always important. Because there is little study available on kratom in combination with other substances, it could be you react differently than most people. So listen carefully to your body and take good care of yourself. Make sure to take action if things start to feel off. Lastly, I do not recommend anyone to take unprescribed drugs, because it happens to work for me does not mean it will work for anybody and it does also not mean it's a smart move."

Thank you for reminding us. I know most of you will probably disagree with me, but I sometimes describe myself as a ""gold-star lesbain"", but I do this ironically. I certainly do not place myself above any other lesbain or bi-woman. In fact, sometimes I contemplate having sex with a man, just for the experience. 
I never realized the term was used to shut other people out. That's awful. If anything I think the queer woman who have to overcone all those hardships ate perhaps even braver than those of us fortunate enough grow up in an open and loving environment.

ugly,fn76jnh,t3_fzjyiq,1586714262.0,"Okay, I want to say two things.

One, you're still a teenager. Your acne will most likely disappear and so will (part) of your insecurity. I'm not saying it will go away, but it will become more managable with time.

Two. If, in fact, you are ugly, or below average looking, try looking at the pros of being ugly. I have talked with a stunning looking girl. She says she can't go to a party and just dance without drooling guys swerming around her. People will often approach a beautiful person, not because of their personality, but because of their looks. If you are below average looking, you know your friends like you for you. Same for if you get a boyfriend/girlfriend. You're not just a status trophy they carry around, they really like you for you. You have to work harder on your skills to get a job, you have to work harder on your personality to get lots of friends and romantic partners. You have to work harder to gain confidence.
When you finally get their, you will be an interesting, skillfull, kind and rounded personality. Not just an beautiful empty shell.

Disclaimer: I'm not saying beautiful people are dumb or shallow. I'm saying people will still give them attention if they are, so being beautiful often means being pushed less to improve yourself."

Like a lot of us, I experience the similar things. I also do uni work online,  and it's really hard and frustrating. It was supposed to be a fun course where you learn a lot of practical stuff about plant breeding, but instead it's a confusing maze of online stuff uni came up with last minute so you can do the course online.

I'm grateful I don't live alone and I don't have to move in with my parents again. I'm gratefull I can work at home and I'm gratefull some teachers really put in effort (shout out to my philosophy teacher), I'm gratefull I am still healthy and know some coping techniques and have a psychologist. However, I am also slowly starting to lose my mind.

I feel anxious and guilty whenever I do go outside. I'm really tired all the time but I do sleep a lot. I cry over little things. I get stressed and I get mad at my girlfriend over nothing. 

Recently, I heard a podcast with a psychiatrist that gave me some insight. He said: except more chaos in your life. If you have turned nocturnal, don't worry. If your house is more messy than usual, if you are not as happy and productive as you used to be, that's normal. If you argue with your partner or family more than normal, ofcourse you do! 

Try to live day by day, count your blessings, know that you are literally saving lives by staying inside and most of all, know that this too shall pass.
Good luck and lots of love to you all!"

So than I like to escape in the wonders of imagination, films, series, writing or just day dreaming. I also use it as a coping mechanism sometimes. For example, my country is pretty much locked down now, and you are only supposed to go outside to buy groceries. However, you are supposed to do all your work at home while all fun activities are cancelled. This harsh reality can be pretty stressfull. So me and my girlfriend like to escape on our Stardew Valley farm :).

BipolarSOs,fi9y0up,t1_fi9tnjv,1582287115.0,"Oke I have to be honest. You sound very frustrated and angry. I think you have to sort some things out at your end of the equation as well.

I think I do have some experience, although my situation is not exactly the same. My gf has bipolar (typeI). She takes medication which makes her libido decline. She gets crumpy, angry, unreasonable. I have low level depression, sometimes anxiety. So yeah, that is hard. But we both put in effort. Don't you dare say that ""I don't understand this condition"" or ""I don't know how to read"". From the looks of it, you are also part of the problem. A relationship consists of two people who have to tango together.

&#x200B;

>Nobody is accusing anything, the condition and meds cause her to not desire, have interest or even think about anything that even remotely resembles any kind of sexual need or want.

If you REALLY believe that she has zero desire, and you can also read her mind so you know she doesn't think about sex ever at all, you are free to walk away. Nobody is forcing you to be in this relationship.

 I'm sure this is a difficult situation and she has problems with her meds and conditions. But she can't do this alone mate. You have to figure this out together. Also you came asking for advice and when I actually gave you some you laughed at me and ridiculed my advice.  If you want to feel like a man again, please act like one."

BipolarSOs,fi9orn1,t3_f71fan,1582274862.0,"Plan some time together for intimacy. Give her a massage, light candles, play music, without necessarily having sex afterwards. 
Talk to her. Maybe her meds make her feel drowsy from her medication and she wants you to be more rough with her so she can actually feel something.
Try channeling your emotions in a sexy way. Sometimes my girlfriend gets angry, and I get anxious. Then we have a nice bdsm spanking session (with safewords ofcourse), and we feel completely at ease afterwards. Try focussing on her needs and romantic/fun things you two can do together before accusing her of what she is doing wrong. People respond better to positve feedback than to negative feedback. If she feels safe and satisfied with you, I am sure romance will follow."

BipolarSOs,fazufn2,t3_ea6d22,1576419796.0,"hi,

I'm sorry to hear about your situation, but the fact that you guys have good communication is really great! I can relate to you at some point, my girlfriend has bipolar disorder, and I suffer from low-level depression and also insecurities. She can have unstable moods where she is suddenly very angry or very scared. The thing that helps best for me is distancing myself from the situation, and talking it out once things have calmed down. When she has uncontrollable anger, physically get out of the room, and return when she is calm again. When she is very anxious, try staying in the same room, but do your own thing (reading a book, watching a movie etc.), this helps her calm down. If  I get insecure and start crying over every little thing, I just isolate myself for a little bit watching youtube videos under a blanket until I can think clearly again. 

One very important thing, if her moods affect you, don't hold it in. Try talking with her about it when you both are clearheaded. Otherwise, resentment will build and the relationship could end.  That's all I have from my experience, hope it helps."
