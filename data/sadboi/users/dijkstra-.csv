I try my best to avoid these techniques and still only work with positive reinforcement.

dogs,fqquunm,t1_fqqucpn,1589572367.0,"Before the restrictions were lifted, my mother saw her during 1:1 sessions in which they trained walking on the leash and stuff like that. That was outside. The last few sessions were at our home and the usually routes we take when going on walks.

The trainer says she's normally of the school of positive reinforcement too, but says the dog needs to be shown boundaries. So we practice exposure to objects that trigger him, and telling him loudly ""NO!"" and making him sit/lie down when he lunges (or tries to). And if he's completely off the rails, force him to sit or lie down. Of course feed him treats when he's calm and from afar etc., so the negative stuff is intended as a last resort.

The forceful methods are something I have a hard time with. Of course I have a hard time arguing with a professional, and due to the situation there's no other trainers available and we're desperate as it is."

We're doing muzzle-training already, though now we're trying to speed up the process so we can muzzle him on walks as soon as possible. Thank you for your insight. We're not giving up on him yet after all, but we just need to see some progress. To make matters worse, he seems to be developing new ""fear-objects"" too.

dogs,foju4zf,t1_fojtwcm,1587829440.0,"Thank you for your time and advice. It's not a proper behaviour therapist. It's the third trainer we're seeing. First one we went to when he was 9 weeks old was some woman doing the training in what appeared to be her backyard.

After that we went to one 30 minutes from here for about 7 weeks. Was pretty good, but shut down due to the coronavirus.

As we were left on our own and the behaviour got worse, we grew desperate and called trainers close by that were listed in the German dog association. We went to one for a few times until she cancelled all further classes due to the virus too.

Finally we ended up with the current trainer, a town over. No website, and as I said unaware of any certifications or official training.

We try to scout ahead around corners and such, but sometimes stuff catches us off guard and people get too close.

The behaviour started about a month or two ago, and grew gradually worse. At first we thought it was simple fear and that he'd grow out of it, through continued exposure and positive reinforcement. But that doesn't seem to happen."

I don't like her very much. Some of the advice she gives my mother (only 1-on-1 training allowed because of corona), sounds inappropriate and not ""with-the-times"". Too much based on authority than positive reinforcement, that type of deal. ""Make the dog sit, if it doesn't sit, push on the base of its tail. If it doesn't want to lie down, pull down the collar.""

Of course it's my word against hers, so my mom sides with her."

I'm definitely trying the positive reinforcement technique. Look at it from afar, click and treat when he behaves as intended etc.

We've spent lots of time in parks or other spaces where he can ""human-watch"", where he's normally calm. When on a walk though, anyone approaching us becomes a target. I can barely keep him under control, my parents have an even harder time.

We also work on teachin him the basics - first at home, then in the field (there's farmland close by), then day-to-day. We train him daily. He gets long walks. He gets to walk off-leash when we're out in the field (can see if anyone approaches). I honestly don't know what we're doing wrong. I tried following every guideline to the letter."
dogs,fojjubn,t1_foj89yz,1587822810.0,"> A  shepherd can be a good family dog, but they take a lot of work and this  is a difficult age (to be honest it’s not going to be easy until he is  about 18 months old and his hormones level out again).

We never expected it to be easy, but not this hard.

>We have a shepherd pup ourselves and he is about eight months old now, the breed is vocal, but not unfriendly.

That has been the experience with the gsd we had before.

>First  the stop technique takes to long for a puppy, he’s not returning  because he figured out that’s what you want, it’s because he’s bored of  standing and waiting for you to keep walking. On pups it definitely  works better to turn around and go the other way when your dog is  pulling you, and once they are walking at your side you can turn around  and go back in the intended direction.

Oh, he returns alright. But then goes straight back to pulling. Though there are times when it's okay. Just when he's anxious, when anything moving is close by.. he pulls towards it and tries to attack it.

>As  for reactivity - teach a watch me command at home with the clicker and  build on that at a distance from distractions gradually getting closer.  Eventually he will learn to ignore things but it’s going to take a whole  lot of time and repetition and you need to be sure that you are all  doing the same thing with him.

That's something we've been doing, but once he sees a target that triggers him, we can't get him to pay attention."

This means they can't take into account individual student's weak-spots. Combine that with a household in which the parents may be unwilling or unable to make up for this at home, and you have a recipe for disaster.

To make matters worse, most Math relies on you to have properly understood the concepts of previous Math classes and are now able to apply them as a foundation. That means once a student is falling behind, there's nearly no way of catching back up - resulting in a lot of ""lost"" students.

That's a mental block that I see no way around. I feel the immense desire to create art, while at the same time finding myself unable to do so. I know my expectations are unrealistic, but I Just can't shake them. My dumb head looks at the retarded cripple art I draw and calls it retarded cripple art while comparing it to people who have like 10 years more experience.

I don't see myself getting around that any time soon, nor I expect you or anyone to have a solution to my problems. Just kind of venting. Maybe should just start a diary lol

Regardless; thank you for taking the time to respond to me."

Ten years ago I was into art, but hated everything I did because of the furry artists I was close friends with. In comparison my shit sucked (obviously), but it really gave my self-confidence a kick  in the groin and destroyed all my enjoyment in art since then.

Went and got a career in IT instead, getting a CS degree at the  moment. A few days ago the realization hit that I still have no creative outlet and nothing I do truly touches people. Art does that. But now it's too late to turn back, I only had one shot at a degree and now I'm stuck doing this and likely never be happy and forever regret my life choices lol"

firefox,f174vkw,t1_f16mab9,1569235620.0,"~~After some digging I found out that it was not in fact caused by Firefox (mea culpa), but rather a recent bug introduced in the~~ [~~Privacy-Setting Add-On~~](https://github.com/schomery/privacy-settings/issues/121) ~~I was using.~~

~~The issue is listed on github and I +1'd it. I had assumed all the add-on did was changing the flags in the about:config - which allowed for quick enabling and disabling of settings if one particular setting broke a website. Seems like it does more. Regardless, not Mozilla's fault. Thanks for the help!~~

EDIT:

Clearly spoke too soon. The reason why it started working after disabling the add-on was because it set the configuration back to default. After changing the setting in about:config to the one it was before I have the same issue. It seems to be related to first party isolation maybe? I'll dig some more.

EDIT 2:

Turns out I wasn't crazy after all - it seems like some part of firstparty isolation in combination with third-party cookie blocking AND exceptions broke. Here's the result of mozregression:
