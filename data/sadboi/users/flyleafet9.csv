TwoXChromosomes,fr2b2io,t3_glzkw6,1589834225.0,"I experienced something similar at my first job as a 16 year old. 

It included a coworker cornering me and trying to hug me despite me repeatedly warning him that I would risk losing my job and attack him if he touched me. 
Management overheard, witnessed this and nothing was done about it. 

I recieved a lot of unwelcome attention and gained a reputation that caused rumors about me being involved with coworkers and management . These rumors resulted in me being sat down TWICE by my boss essentially trying to get me to admit to starting a rumor because clearly I was a big flirt that was involved with a manager and started this rumor out of jealousy /s

People that were friendly with me stopped talking to me. I felt like people were actively ignoring me and had it confirmed that it was because people thought I did all of that with an agenda. I quit right after finding this out. 

I should have escalated this above my boss and it's still disgusting to think about. I was a teen who had never been on a date or had a boyfriend and was ashamed to be labeled as loose/ a flirt at work because it simply wasn't the reality. My boss knew because I had been confronted twice and continued to play into it  I'm so angry for teenage me.

However, she is close to being a legal adult and will have the responsibilities of a legal adult. She made a stupid choice and will have to deal with repercussions regardless of the path she takes. Sucks, but it's just how it is. 

I wasn't putting all of the blame on a teen, but I did say she has a lot if it. Children should not be having or even thinking about having babies, planned or not. 

I never said children need two parents of the opposite sex. I did say single parent households expose children to more risks. For example, these children are more likely to drop out. Yeah,  you don't technically need both parents, but by having one parent you will face more challenges. A two income household is more likely to be able to handle the possibility of chronic conditions or special needs. A one parent household may manage but will likely suffer, whether it be due to stress from lack of time or lack of finances. 

 I will not suggest abortion because OP did not seem receptive to the suggestion and there is no way to tell the daughter directly.

Her parents are within their rights (given the do so legally) to try and remove her from their home. Thankfully, it sounds like OP is against that. 

It is irresponsible to play this off as typical teenage impulsiveness and shenanigans. His daughter was selfish by planning a pregnancy when she apparently wasn't prepared. Please look up the risks that children of single parents face. It's not fair. 

I do agree the mother is being selfish and I'm guessing it has to do with saving face, but the daughter is almost an adult and made a very adult decision and is therefore subject to judgement"

relationships,fqm3ilm,t3_gj1gdz,1589470878.0,"Oh boy. I have a lot of thoughts on this and hope you read this. 

OP, I think you need to be honest with yourself. She has gone through a lot of shit in the past year and I highly doubt there is a chance she can go back to being the person she was when you two first started dating, especially given her mother's condition. With that said, I wouldnt doubt things get worse as her mother's health begins to worsen. 

I'd ask yourself if you are okay with things not going back to the way they were. Things can improve, but it's not guaranteed to be easy or quick. 

If you find yourself 110% committed to her and are willing to stand by her through this and worse, I'd recommend some couples counseling to start. Ideally a counselor/therapist would be able to come up with a plan to keep you both accountable (most of it is on her). 

Something did stand out to me - she commented on you being positive. Has she told you whether or not the positivity is helpful or encouraging to her? This might be something for you to discuss. Based on what you wrote, it doesn't appear to be helping so it might be time for you to drop the act (for your sake). 
I can't say what you being positive consists of, but I'd be wary since it can come off as insensitive. Her mother is dying and it's pretty hard/impossible to be positive about it. 

If you read all of this and don't feel 110% committed to her (and accept she will very likely never be the person she was before) it might be time to go your seperate ways. Compassion fatigue is a very real thing, and it doesnt sound like you are equipped to help her deal with her problems. 
If this is the case, it is only fair to have an honest conversation with her and let her know what's up."

I am in the same boat. I don't know when, but some time as a teen I realized that pregnancy terrified me. Like not even just birth itself, but the pregnancy. Coupled with my eating disorder and some other mental stuff, I was worried pregnancy would result in worsening body dysmorphia and exacerbate my already poor mental and emotional health. There's also the fact that I am afraid of passing along some shitty genes, but this depends on your family I guess. 

When I became sexually active, I made sure I had a plan. This included condoms, daily birth control, plan B, and abortion if necessary. I have only had to use plan B once. 

Even when I stopped using condoms, I made sure to be diligent with birth control and will even take tests when I am anxious ( I never had regular periods). I guess the best way to describe it is my anxiety decreased the more I saw the birth control working over time. Either way, don't become cocky or overconfident and make sure to keep up with your birth control. You mentioned it in your post but it is important that your partner is on the same page as well. 

I just want to say that I think its completely normal but not talked about much. There are many, many women/mothers who were terrified of pregnancy AND motherhood but dealt with it because that's what society expected of them. There are people in the thread that are suggesting therapy to address this fear but I dont think it's necessary. I would only suggest seeing someone about it if it becomes debilitating or harmful to any part of your life (like not being able to have sex out of fear, etc). 

Just like there are some people who think it's the end of the world if they can't have kids, there are those who may feel like it's the end of the world if they do become pregnant/have kids. Both are legitimate feelings and I hope people can respect that."

On one end you have people who do not want kids (bio or adopted) and do not want to be around kids EVER. These people may refuse to date someone with children, even if they children are fully grown and independent adults due to the risk of grandchildren. 


On the other end you have people who do like kids/love working with kids but don't want their own, or are open to caring after older children/teens. Someone on this side of the spectrum may be open to dating someone with kids and may not be opposed to grandchildren. I'd put these people in a category similar to those who enjoy spending time with their nieces and nephews. 

Then there are those who may interpret childfree as no kids/no young kids. Teens may act more like adults than children, so they may be more tolerable for some and not considered in that child category.

If I noticed I was having an off day, I might go for a long run to try and relive some of that  stress. However, if i was in the middle of an episode there is no way I would be able to compose myself enough to go out (gym or public). 

Running isn't a universal cure but it can be helpful for some people."
news,fmxr251,t1_fmwh5eo,1586470217.0,I feel you. We can't turn on all the lights in our living room without the breaker tripping and this has been unresolved since Christmas. There were some broken things when we moved in that have never been addressed so we figure they  are never going to be fixed at this point
news,fmxotmp,t1_fmwgd8l,1586469013.0,"Oh we were totally fine with the fees originally considering it was cheaper than what we were paying for our old gym memberships. It just sucks to still be paying it and feel like it's not being spent well. 

The community maintenance fee is supposed to go to general upkeep and the common areas are part of that. We do not feel the grounds have been taken care of and have even had unresolved maintenance issues since December. As much we love this place, we have already have plans to move elsewhere after this lease."
news,fmvy98h,t1_fmvwze8,1586434819.0,"Lol ours closed the gym, pool, and offices that we pay a mandatory $30 a month to have access to and told us to pay rent online. Community maintenance fee my ass"
Adoption,fmvv356,t1_fmva6va,1586431935.0,"Based off of your post history it is clear there are people who are more committed to their house plants than you are to the kids you are ""helping"". Its absolutely pathetic that you are using children for income."
relationship_advice,fmvdlqn,t1_fmv9137,1586413368.0,Nah it just sounds like an incompatibility. It's like dating a sneakerhead - some people are cool with it and some people think it's the dumbest thing ever
relationship_advice,fmvd3vw,t1_fmv7alz,1586412910.0,Dont know why this is so far down. I feel if the genders were reversed people would be more empathetic. I can't imagine being the only one working and taking care of the house. I wonder who is in charge of childcare during the day
relationship_advice,fmvcxns,t3_fxhph4,1586412754.0,"OP, yelling at your child, especially to that extent is not acceptable. However, working and being responsible for nearly all of the housework for a family of 4 (soon to be 5) sounds pretty damn stressful, so I can understand why he may be having outbursts. 

I know you are limited with your current ailment, but it might be time to try and talk to him and see if this is his problem. Maybe you can try and help out more when you are feeling better? Or maybe it's time to get some help from family or friends?"
relationship_advice,fmvch42,t1_fmv8ug9,1586412338.0,"Oof. Most of the mothers in my family were/are the primary breadwinners. My own mother physically punished us and my friends with troubled or strict households had severely abusive and unstable mothers. It's unfortunately more common than you would think. I'd estimate it was half of the households I have encountered.

 I don't believe believe women are innately more nurturing, and to say so I quite sexist imho."

My partner and I find them super convenient when hosting meals. 

My great aunts had their own embroidered cloth warmers that would fit neatly in the plastic or styrofoam warmers. I'm planning on making my own."
todayilearned,fmt1xok,t1_fmq1mpr,1586365557.0,"Yeah, that's kind of what I got too. There is nothing wrong with someone who has dealt with various mental health issues pursuing a career in social work. Although I can see the appeal, the anti psychiatry is concerning."
Healthyhooha,fmrn6ex,t1_fmrmqlm,1586328495.0,My experience is very similar. I'd say I have a period or spotting 4-6 times a year. The couple years I was anemic/malnourished I had maaaaybe 1. It wouldn't hurt to get hour hormones and iron levels checked.

todayilearned,fmq56e8,t1_fmq0b9g,1586293068.0,"I'll be blunt with you - lots of people are misinformed about mental health professionals. For example, there are a LOT of people who believe the primary function of a psychologist is to work with serial killers or ""twisted"" individuals. This was heavily influenced by media.

Not every individual or group that appears on the show is met with intervention like conditions. Regardless, interventions tend to be pretty successful. 

Unless you yourself experienced it or the professionals you speak of witnessed the quality of his care directly, there is no way to know."
todayilearned,fmq42m2,t1_fmpyyew,1586292492.0,"I don't understand this. Nothing on the show has compared to the years of therapy I have experienced with about 4 different therapists and 1 psychiatrist.

 I don't think the intent was to host the show and treat it as therapy sessions. To start, I cant think of any party that would have benefited from just one session, and one ""group"" session at that. The paperwork to include one other person/inform them of patient information is extensive, so I dont see how it would be logistically possible for an entire audience (in person and at home) to complete these forms. 

There's a lot of debate on whether or not he gives advice, but the reality is if he were a therapist or counselor he shouldn't be giving advice at all. I don't know what kind of mental health professional you are, but giving advice is frowned upon and is something they repeatedly go over in school - I'm talking basic Psych 101 stuff. As a patient/client I have personally not witnessed it but would be concerned if any advice had been given (aside from ""self care"" homework, I also was not in a treatment center). More importantly, it isn't illegal for a talk show host or any other unlicensed person to give advice. 

As a mental health professional I hope you realize how prohibitive treatment costs can actually be. Even places that offer sliding scales that often range from 40-100+ per hour for basic counseling from students are costly over time. Someone who is living paycheck to paycheck may not be able to pursue treatment because they have other bills they need to prioritize. 

It appears he offers connections to various services and treatment programs that provide the actual treatment. As far as I know, this is done free of cost. Considering there is a number of treatment programs and inpatient programs that don't even accept insurance, the fact that these services are provided for free to people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford them is amazing. 

I believe he is simply a life coach and entertainer that provides desperate people with resources. To my knowledge, there is nothing indicating anything on the show was supposed to be interpreted as a replacement for actual therapy or counseling."
todayilearned,fmpziiz,t1_fmpqnb8,1586290146.0,"I definitely wouldn't call what he provides therapy. What he does is connect people with resources that allow them to recieve treatment including therapy that they otherwise wouldn't have. 

The discussion that takes place does not in any way resemble what therapy is actually like. Even if it were, I doubt it would be very legal considering I cant even imagine what kind of paperwork would have to completed to air these interactions."

I honestly can't see any harm. I understand why it would be easy to criticize the sign, but I dont think its harmful to provide reassurance to patients. The doesn't encourage their unhealthy habits."
fatlogic,fmmgk20,t1_fmjcx7v,1586204871.0,"Yikes. There are tons of different types of eating disorders. Even as a former bulimic that sign would have triggered a bad episode. I understand how its helpful, but I think it's insensitive. 

Binge eating disorder is an eating disorder and surprise surprise, has ties to obesity. Given such a large portion of the population is obese or morbidly obese, wouldn't you suspect there is a decent percent that suffer from an eating disorder?"
