You assume people won't work if given the choice, but I think that's a faulty assumption, people want to be productive and active, if not through work then through personal achievements (such as art), or volunteering. Employers would just need to provide more of an incentive for people. Also $1000/ft isn't much, so having a job on top of that would be beneficial to most people. Without employment you can't get a loan, so buying a house or a car would be out of people's reach on UBI alone."

TNG,fpong46,t1_fpmzb0i,1588787440.0,"> Sorin got inside the nexus once by complete accident, as did Kirk, but  now he has to be on a planet in order to do it?  I think it's okay to  complain about ""canon"" that has been established within the same movie. 

Because a ship would've been destroyed, recall at the beginning the people on the ship were phasing in and out, they couldn't stay in the Nexus, because ships caught in the Nexus were dragging the passengers back into normal spacetime as the Nexus dragged the ships across the sector. Being on a fixed point as the Nexus passes through it greatly increases the chances of staying in the Nexus.  


> How does an entire family pass away in a fire?  Call 911 and get beamed  out.  Assuming one of the 3000 satellites around Earth didn't pick up  the house fire and automatically beam you out.  Not the biggest  complaint, but this review spends half the time talking about that  event, and the event itself is completely implausible. 

No system is perfect and tragic accidents do happen. Also you're forgetting the forest for the trees, the whole point of the deaths, narratively, was to setup Picard's arc. Without that he has no character arc. Just as Kirk has no character arc and his presence is basically meaningless.  


>Why not ignore Kirk and go back a week, or a month, or however long it  takes to stop Sorin before anything happens?  Go back to the bridge of  the Enterprise five minutes ago, for example.  ""You remember where they  sent me?  That's where Sorin is.  Now that they no longer have any  hostages, nuke Sorin before anything bad happens."" 

The Enterprise doesn't know where Picard was beamed down, his pattern was routed by the Bird of Prey. He's without his commbadge, they'd have the scan the entire planet for one human lifesign, that could take too long. Also you can ask ""why not this"" for any plot point which defeats the purpose of the story. Why didn't Data killed Soran? Why didn't Kirk say fuck it and not go to the Ent-B launch? Why kill Rene and Robert? Why anything.  


> How does the battle between the Enterprise and the BoP go so badly?  Just fucking shoot them until they die. 

While the BoP is old it's still a formidable ship of combat. It also had the Enterprise's shield frequency, so the Ent's shield were functionally useless. All the BoP's shot were passing right through the striking the hull. This happened so fast the Enterprise crew barely had a chance to respond and by the time they did it was too late for the Warp Core.  
Also that's part of the plot, the destruction of the Enterprise is symbolic to the narrative.  


> Changes in gravity travel at the speed of light.  A star exploding  wouldn't force a ship to make a course correction.  It also wouldn't  change the course of the nexus that quickly unless the nexus was already  in the Amargosa star system, which would have been kind of noticeable.   Similarly, the light from an exploded star wouldn't reach the planet  the instant the star blew up, but 8 minutes later (give or take).  Ok,  maybe that's minutiae, but it seriously made no sense, especially when  they showed the first exploding star's explosion take a normal amount of  time to reach the space station. 

Star Trek has played fast and loose with realworld science innumerable times. The light from the star dimming instantly is just film language, it helps set the tone and create drama. Waiting 8 minutes would be a bit boring, no matter how realistic.  


The gravitational pull of the stars drags the Nexus inward slightly, removing that pull ""pushes"" it outward. So a sudden drop in gravity travelling at light speed, would most certainly affect the Nexus entering the system at sublight, it wouldn't be dragged inward, instead it would continue on course and intersect with Veridian III  


> Here's a speech Picard could have given Sorin: ""If you try to launch  your rocket, our ship will nuke you from orbit.  If you come with us  peacefully, our ship can tow fucking asteroids.  We'll give you a space  suit, put you on an asteroid, and deposit you in front of the nexus.   Deal?"" 

""If you stop being the antagonist we'll do something visually boring and narratively pointless.""  


> Why does Sorin do *anything* he  does all movie?  For example, he kidnaps Geordie.  Why?  Sorin already  knows how to build the star destroying missile, so he won't learn  anything new from him.  There's no longer a need to question Geordie to  see if anyone else knows about the missile, because just a moment ago  the Enterprise saw the missile blow up the sun.  It's not like he was  planning on use Geordie to spy on the Enterprise, since that seemed like  more of an afterthought once they had no further use for him. 

Soran is something of a sadist. He enjoys inflicting pain, as he did when he told Picard ""time is the fire in which we burn"" he knew which words would cut Picard deepest at that moment, being an El Aurian.  


Geordi fascinated him, his VISOR fascinated him. He also needed information on the Enterprise now that he knew it was on his trail when Geordi refused his used his VISOR.  


It's not a great movie by any stretch, but few of your points made sense."
