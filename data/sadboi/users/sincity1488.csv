I am actually suffering from Borderline personality disorder but I am not on any kind of medication. I didn't think it could be because of my disorder because I've had it for quite some time and this only started 6 months ago. I will do my best to analyze whole situation and get to the bottom of it.
Thank you so much❤️"
