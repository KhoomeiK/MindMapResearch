>I thought I'd recovered as much as was possible for me, and was just happy to finally have it somewhat under control, after years of having my entire life revolve around my ED.

I have felt the exact way before, like that's as good as it's gonna get, I just have to live with that. But that is so not true! I'm not all the way there yet but I know it's possible to fully recover and that I don't have to live a life where my ed still controls parts of me. We can beat this!"

EDAnonymous,fp9a3us,t3_gbp4nk,1588419992.0,"Thanks for sharing, it is so important to keep in mind how dangerous these disorders are to our health. I'm currently in recovery from bulimia and doing much better than a couple of month ago. I'm also at a normal BMI. But my therapist still said to me at our last session that he still considers my symptons a serious risk to my health. Because binging and purging is always detrimental to your health and I, and probably a lot of others too, tend to forget that and think, nah, it's not that bad, if I'm only purging like once or twice a week."

My therapy homework is to eat three meals a day that provide me with sufficient energy. For a few months I thought this isn't possible for me because I kept thinking I need to lose weight first.

But now, I've been having my three meals a day for the last two weeks and it has helped with my binge urges massively. I don't feel the need to eat every last bit of food I have at home anymore.

Dojng this has the same outcome of not losing weight as years of b/p did, but at least I don't feel nearly as miserable anymore doing it like this.

I still have bad days where I want to cry because I hate that my stomach feels so full, I feel bloated every single day because my digestive system isn't used to keeping down so much food, I still weigh myself way to often and worry about gaining weight. But I still continue to give my body the energy it needs because I don't want to feel as miserable as I did before anymore. It feels incredibly uncomfortable at times but I just keep trying"

Yeah, so you can eat everything you want but there's just a slight catch to it, you also have to throw it all up afterwards, oh and you also have to feel miserable about eating something as well as about not eating it. There is no right choice"
