AskReddit,fbt3qra,t1_fbrlvbc,1577067500.0,Came here just to find this comment. For years I thought people exgrated on how fuck up this movie was or they were remembering it differently...and I finally watched it for myself. I was mentally fucked up pretty good for about a week or so.
dannyphantom,fblomtz,t3_ednvsi,1576966318.0,There an app on Xbox that I watched it on I believe it's Cartoon Unlimited
relationship_advice,f3wdtwu,t1_f3vu4y5,1571198979.0,"Yeah I called her right when I woke up after I read the Facebook message Friday morning. She said she remembers her and my dad trying to call him for the first 5-6 years of my life a few times a year encouraging him to come visit even offering to drive to Arizona for a weekend trip and he'd bush it off. Like I was a chore. She remembers him saying ""oh no I don't want to be a bother to you guys and I don't really have any where to put the baby"" *calling me a baby even by the age of 5-6>.. definitely not baby age anymore* and then when we left Nevada in 2000 she just stopped trying to call."
relationship_advice,f3w6l2s,t1_f3w35vl,1571193259.0,I'm not sure. I don't know her maiden name. Neither does my mom =/ when she met her her last name was already my last name and if she ever told her it she doesn't remember and that was 20+ years ago
relationship_advice,f3vc9yp,t1_f3uhyqf,1571174265.0,I wish I could give you gold for this comment. It's the perfect most fitting level of pettyness.
relationship_advice,f3v0nr6,t1_f3us3js,1571170015.0,I'm 100% skeptical. don't get me wrong. I am very wary of him. I don't believe he has any remorse and am certain he is either on his death bed and feels guilty or wants something from me. I just want a way to ask all the questions about my birth mother and our family history with out him thinking it means anything to me and making it clear he is not family.
relationship_advice,f3v04g0,t1_f3uqgu9,1571169752.0,I have thought about this but their parents are both dead so really BF is the only one left to tell me about it. That and any history of birth mother. My parents didn't know a whole lot of her back story as they had only know her about 5 years before I was born. I know she has a sister in New Mexico and that she worked in finance and payroll for a casino Nevada.
relationship_advice,f3u4ru8,t1_f3u3fbd,1571152907.0,Lol that's what I've been doing for 4 days
