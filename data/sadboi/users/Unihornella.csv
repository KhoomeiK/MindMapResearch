SuicideWatch,fnh8ps4,t3_g1n72l,1586957490.0,"I did the same thing. Deleted everything. No one contacted me either. But honestly now, about four years later, I can see that it was the right choice. I cared about those people no more than they cared about me, really. And the constant comparisons you talk about, they don't happen for me anymore. No longer get that stomach dropping feeling when I think about my ""friends"". Life is too short to spend it worrying about other people. I hope you have the headspace to figure out what makes *you* happy. Not what other people say makes them happy."
