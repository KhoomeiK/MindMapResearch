And people living outside of NYC, who can live a nice life for $70,000 per year, who maybe still have their jobs ... just get an extra $2,000 per month per person. $96,000 annually for a family of four. That‚Äôs student loan payoff, down payment type money, the kind of stuff that this pandemic put completely out of my reach after working so hard for so long. 

Maybe it is selfish, but it would be very hard on me if this passed. It would be like watching everyone else get a windfall while I can‚Äôt pay my rent. I began to feel a bit suicidal when I first read about it (I‚Äôm fine now) because I just felt so helpless and hopeless.

And then, because my income is higher than average in the country but not my city, I‚Äôd be paying the increased taxes to pay for everyone else‚Äôs benefit, while I also try to pay off the debt being created right now to keep a roof over my head.

news,fpu6aui,t1_fpt7sxq,1588905602.0,"He spelled out metrics weeks ago. They‚Äôve been met. So now he put a whole new system in place, that will be close to impossible to meet. But it‚Äôs cool, because he‚Äôs put together a team of billionaires to ‚Äúreimagine‚Äù New York and he just needs us to stay locked up long enough for him to effectuate the vision. Sigh ..."

CoronavirusNewYork,fptsnwf,t1_fptn2ua,1588897466.0,"Or worse .. that the 600 continues and people continue with their moral outrage at those of us who do need to work. Obviously, I think that safety measures are critical, but it‚Äôs time for the young and healthy to get moving. Myself included!"
CoronavirusNewYork,fptsf0l,t1_fptp8c9,1588897323.0,"No, no. Not my point. I‚Äôm saying that if you allow people with antibodies to go back to work first (making everyone else stay home) then you are incentivizing people to purposefully get the virus, so that they can then work. I would try to get the virus if it meant that I could work once I recovered. No extra pay. Just to get normal pay."
CoronavirusNewYork,fptmi43,t1_fprkfvd,1588894043.0,Yup. We already met Cuomo‚Äôs metrics ... so he created new metrics.
CoronavirusNewYork,fptmfmv,t1_fprmede,1588894005.0,"I think that most of the people not yet worried did not like their jobs and are now receiving more UBI than their prior salaries. Life isn‚Äôt so bad when all you have to do is stay inside, make tik tok videos and morally judge those who are begging to work to pay the bills. Those of us who need to work are VERY worried and waiting for the rest to catch up."
CoronavirusNewYork,fptm713,t1_fpqg6jp,1588893873.0,That‚Äôs a terrible idea. You‚Äôd be providing people with a financial incentive to try to get the virus. That‚Äôs one of the reasons that they scrapped it.
changemyview,fpsz8op,t1_fpssps9,1588882131.0,No. Not at all. You‚Äôre missing the point entirely. It‚Äôs kinda like you think things are ‚Äúfree‚Äù instead of paid for and enjoyed collectively when government-provided. Which is a bit disturbing.
changemyview,fpsr3ll,t1_fpsotgf,1588878186.0,"Ah. So you‚Äôre having an argument with profit insurers and health care providers, but purporting to be having a conversation with me, even though I‚Äôm neither nor have I supported either. See how that makes it a bit odd ... you obviously have some sort of point that you want to make, but if it has nothing to do with my post, then maybe find somewhere else to make it."
changemyview,fpsnp6p,t1_fpsh2k6,1588876552.0,"Literally no one is saying anyone should be turned away. You‚Äôre arguing against no one. 

And your assertion that societal pressure doesn‚Äôt change behavior is belied by state by state obesity statistics. In the south, for example, it‚Äôs more socially acceptable to be a bit heavy. In the north, less so. And that has a direct impact on health and quality of life. And we‚Äôre all in it together. 

You‚Äôre arguing from a place of emotion and ignoring some pretty basic facts. Maybe you just need an argument today."
changemyview,fpsdban,t1_fpsc0c7,1588871543.0,"May I ask, what exactly are you arguing for as it relates to my point? That there should be no societal pressure to control one‚Äôs weight as a preventative health measure within the collective system?"
changemyview,fps8g3b,t1_fps3e7m,1588869218.0,"You‚Äôre totally missing the point. I‚Äôm referring to preventable disease that is preventable IF people take personal responsibility for their health, including maintaining a healthy BMI. You say that it‚Äôs a capitalist‚Äôs point of view, but actually, it‚Äôs a socialist reality and to the extent that we move in the direction of socialized medicine, we need to deal with it honestly. 

In order for a collective system to work, everyone has to take personal responsibility within the collective. This is true for health care and for other socialist programs. Everyone needs to do their best to contribute. Your resistance to that fact is actually what is going to cause capitalism to succeed over socialism (which I gather is not your intent)."
changemyview,fprvbcw,t1_fpqr238,1588862734.0,"Actually, we‚Äôre ALL responsible for EVERYONE‚Äôs body through the ACA and increasingly socialized medicine. Someone else‚Äôs diabetes and heart disease impacts my wallet. My healthy body saves the system money. So unless you‚Äôre arguing for a private health care system that permits discrimination based upon BMI and exclusions for preexisting conditions ... anyone has a right to argue for others to get healthy. And ‚Äúbody positivity‚Äù or ‚Äúfat acceptance‚Äù is contrary to that."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fprnycx,t1_fpr4b71,1588858559.0,"As I‚Äôve observed it, it‚Äôs mostly people who are receiving unemployment that is paying ALL of their prior income. I mean, if I could not work at all AND have money to pay my bills, I‚Äôd have the luxury of arguing for some moral perfection as well. But, I am working, my income is significantly reduced, I‚Äôm not getting any benefits and I can‚Äôt pay my bills. So, I‚Äôm begging for some middle ground, common sense ability to work. Which apparently makes me a terrible person."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fprnm5t,t1_fpqz89w,1588858343.0,"You‚Äôre getting angry at someone for arguing for what is needed under the system as it exists. The next election is in November. New government in place no earlier than January. So I hope that you got some sort of emotional release from your message, but people want to pay their bills before January and not be used as a pawn in your political message."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fprnczf,t1_fpqsp4p,1588858182.0,"$1,650 wouldn‚Äôt pay bills here. In NYC - hardest hit city in the world - average rent for a one bedroom is over $3,000. Add other bills and food, and what is one to do? We‚Äôre incurring massive debt and risking credit scores that will take 7 years to rebuild. And I don‚Äôt expect the federal government to adjust for cost of living in the area. So we NEED to work."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fprn21k,t1_fpqwl37,1588857992.0,"People aren‚Äôt asking for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù social situations. Just work with a mask, staggered start times, etc would be a legitimate life saver for millions."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fprmulz,t1_fpqsdpn,1588857864.0,It seems like the media tends to focus on the idiots of the group. Most people really do just need to go to work.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fprmqin,t1_fpq30h3,1588857793.0,"Maybe so, but at this particular moment, the system is what it is and people need to work. Unless there is a guarantee that people‚Äôs existing bills will be paid, they need to work. Benefits aren‚Äôt hitting everyone and they are almost useless in the highest hit areas like NYC, where average one bedrooms are over $3,000."
Coronavirus,fpposdt,t3_gekfoz,1588806260.0,"While I think it makes sense to show appreciation, I don‚Äôt think it makes sense to give a windfall like this to a certain group of people, particularly when they are a small minority of people who still have their incomes. It‚Äôs pure happenstance that they were able to continue to work and others have been banned from working. Everyone is sacrificing and hurting. Keep in mind that the rest of people who are currently unemployed with student loans will now be paying those student loans, and debt created during unemployment, and increased taxes to pay for medical student loans. It‚Äôs going to keep them in the hole for a very long time."
CoronavirusNewYork,fpp6wtj,t3_gennrg,1588797018.0,This is New York. Cuomo isn‚Äôt letting us open.
CoronavirusNewYork,fpp6uh1,t3_geo99p,1588796985.0,You heard correctly. So I‚Äôd love to know how he expects us to meet his new benchmarks since we‚Äôve already been shut down for 6 weeks.
CoronavirusNewYork,fpp6p7q,t3_gepsy5,1588796910.0,"I couldn‚Äôt find it. However, we are soooooo far from the requirement (like 250%) after 6 weeks of shut down, that it‚Äôs hard to imagine that it could be met at any point in the coming months. 

Definitely feels like bullshit that we met Cuomo‚Äôs original goal posts (numbers down for 14 days; we‚Äôre way past that) so he moved the goal posts on Monday. Why, so that his new billionaire task force has time to ‚Äúreimagine society?‚Äù 

I‚Äôm very worried that Cuomo is trying to get into the history books as doing something amazing with his billionaire task force, while the people can‚Äôt pay rent or buy food. It‚Äôs okay to just do okay."
CoronavirusNewYork,fpmq2pp,t1_fpmft5u,1588738794.0,Nope. Just the rules that you claim to exist during the pandemic!
CoronavirusNewYork,fpllq9x,t1_fpljloa,1588714990.0,It isn‚Äôt reckless disregard. It‚Äôs completely permitted and appropriate. You‚Äôre making up rules that don‚Äôt exist and then getting outraged that I‚Äôm violating your made up rules. Which makes this a nonsensical conversation so I‚Äôm gonna just step out now.
CoronavirusNewYork,fplj8sc,t1_fpliteu,1588713695.0,"You‚Äôre enabling her bad behavior and harming a child by doing so. I‚Äôm not going to continue to debate the massive distinctions between war and the coronavirus, but I don‚Äôt know what your end game is here. For her to feel okay not seeing her kid, and the emotional toll on the kid doesn‚Äôt matter?"
