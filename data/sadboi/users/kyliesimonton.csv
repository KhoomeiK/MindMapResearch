911dispatchers,fp3y02o,t3_gb3x66,1588287918.0,"I worked for a smaller agency several years ago and we learned to take calls and dispatch simultaneously. I had two weeks of observation and was thrown into it. That agency didn’t have EMD so we didn’t triage medical calls,  it we did dispatch for police, fire, EMS, and National Park Service. It wasn’t completely overwhelming since it was a smaller county.

Now, I work at a HUGE agency. Our floor is separated with fire dispatch, EMS, dispatch, police dispatch, and call takers. Fire department and EMS handles their own dispatch. For police dispatch, everyone has to do one full year of call taking before promoting to dispatch. Our call taking training is 22 weeks. Dispatch training is more compact and shorter, but it’s a great system to learn the job and slowly transition to independence on the floor."

Paranormal,f9jvos5,t1_f9juw0b,1575386900.0,It might have been. I was unable to attend his funeral. I was his world when I was growing up. Maybe he paid me a visit one last time.
Greyhounds,f9jrr56,t3_e5bhmz,1575384096.0,Pretty baby!
confessions,f9jrqek,t3_e57pf4,1575384081.0,Glad you’re still here. ❤️

Paranormal,f9jr61z,t1_f9ixdyk,1575383657.0,And my grandfather died while I was in Japan.
Paranormal,f9jr5e0,t1_f9ixdyk,1575383643.0,Hooooooly moly. My best friend had died about that same time it happened the first time. She died on a head on car crash.
Paranormal,f9hbebx,t1_f9hanoo,1575312308.0,"It definitely wasn’t my imagination. The first time, I had a white noise machine on. It was a simple, droning noise and sounded nothing like what I heard.

I very vividly remember by name being said. It startled me because it had come out of no where and felt like a person was right in my face.

My fan was not on.

I’m a pretty logical person when it comes to ghosty or weird things, but I could not explain this away. It has bugged me for years."
911dispatchers,f9gmali,t3_e4s5dg,1575301512.0,Sounds like your leadership failed you. Day and night shifts are polar opposites as far as calls go. Day shift is more admin work vs the rocking and rolling night shift does. Reapply.
aww,f980l4f,t1_f96wwrh,1575172512.0,They are fabulous apartment dogs! Their energy level is pretty low. They only require a couple short walks a day. They pretty much sleep the rest.

Thank you!"

aww,f91pa9y,t1_f91p7uy,1574997030.0,It took a couple of tries. I would try to keep them still with a treat to focus on while the phone could get the best focus.
Greyhounds,f91npe1,t1_f91nmvz,1574995618.0,Well hello there!
aww,f91n5l5,t1_f91lqlu,1574995130.0,Lol! I had to put painters tape at eye level on the glass for them the first few weeks.
Greyhounds,f91iobp,t1_f91bpsm,1574991185.0,They are mine lol
Greyhounds,f91ino3,t1_f91ak3r,1574991170.0,Yes! These are my girls. Haha

aww,f91hxzt,t1_f90dvve,1574990548.0,Both like to help.... but only where taste-testing is needed. Lol
aww,f91hvwk,t1_f90cd6q,1574990498.0,"She’s my blossoming little timid girl. She used to be scared of everything, but is trying her best to open up. She’s doing so good!"
aww,f91ht5m,t1_f91hq89,1574990433.0,I would not trust them off leash as most typically have a high prey drive. They could take off and be miles away before they realize they’re lost. It’s best to leash walk if you don’t have an enclosed yard.
aww,f91hqsv,t1_f90hg7r,1574990375.0,They used to race at a track in West Virginia. Neither of them were excellent at it so they retired early.
aww,f91hnfs,t1_f90li9r,1574990293.0,"So, my lighter brindle escaped a couple years ago. I got a call saying someone saw her because she was running alongside their car at about 40mph."
aww,f91hkvp,t1_f90oshs,1574990229.0,They get all the pets!
aww,f91hj8e,t1_f90s5jj,1574990187.0,"It took about a week or two for the ones I fostered. They prefer to relieve themselves outside...but sometimes carpet works for them too. Haha Racers live super-structured lives, so they adapt to routine very well."

aww,f91hfd6,t1_f90vmwo,1574990092.0,Meat market dogs typically come from Asia. There is a rescue in the western part of the US who frequently rescues dogs fe Asian meat markets.
aww,f91h4vd,t1_f9159c2,1574989838.0,Their adoption fee was $300/each. It took about a month to adopt each.

aww,f8zjhgh,t1_f8ziqam,1574961534.0,They’re huge love bugs
aww,f8ziozg,t1_f8zgcmy,1574961230.0,"Just be sure to give them patience. The first few weeks are the most confusing for them because most retired racers don’t really know how to be a house pet. It’s fun to watch them experience “firsts.”

My first greyhound had never seen the ocean. When I took her to her first beach trip, it was adorable. She loved it!"
aww,f8zicsv,t1_f8zg7gf,1574961086.0,Greyhounds are pretty lazy dogs. They sleep 16-18 hours a day. Only need a couple of short walks a day and they’re good to go.
aww,f8zi339,t1_f8zab54,1574961015.0,"True! But they don’t even need to run. Two, 20 minute walks a day and they sleep the rest lol"
aww,f8z9m5u,t1_f8z78ja,1574958661.0,Will do

confessions,f8lgjol,t3_e0n5zz,1574621983.0,"Please don’t leave this world. Don’t end it. Suicide is tragic from the moment it is thought about to the moment a person’s body is found. Suicide victims are rarely found quickly. My husband is on forensics and he’s never responded to a scene where the person was recognizable. It is horrible. 

You matter. You are worth more than you know. You are loved. This situation is temporary. It gets so much better."
