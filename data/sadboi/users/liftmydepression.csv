smallbusiness,f96k2c8,t3_e3asyq,1575146404.0,"Hey, I just wanted to tell you that I can only imagine what that must feel like. I have no advice except that reducing your work hours or taking a couple of months off could help. It sounds like you are burnt out and your body and mind needs a break. I wish you a lot of strength and hope you feel better soon! ü§ó"

depression,f96h7jb,t3_e41juc,1575144951.0,"Count backwards from 10 to zero. ‚è±When you hit zero you get up and get ready for work. No thinking about it, no decisions to take whether to go or not - just make yourself get out of the house. I know it sounds harsh, but it works. 

You will feel better since you are being productive again and you‚Äôll be working on something, which takes your mind off all the hard stuff. Calling in sick will just create a downward spiral. 

Would that be an idea? 

Motivation comes through motion. Don‚Äôt wait for motivation to magically strike you."
mentalhealth,f96g75c,t3_e3t9qt,1575144593.0,Just curious... why do you choose not to share those goals with your psychologist?
depression,f96g2da,t3_e42dsl,1575144499.0,From my experience talking to people openly about the way you feel helps A LOT. It will make you feel more connected and less alone with your feelings. Perhaps something you could do?
depression,f7h467c,t1_f7e3vsi,1573731594.0,Do it today. It will help so much.
depression,f7e2r2t,t1_f78gqag,1573643700.0,I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that. Are you seeing a therapist?
depression,f78fm3v,t3_dujc20,1573492310.0,"Look I know life doesn‚Äôt feel good right now, but I truly believe that you can make your situation better. Everyone can make it better somehow. 

I‚Äôm not talking about pink unicorn type of happiness, but contentment that you are doing something meaningful with your life, whether that‚Äôs raising a child or helping others in some way, starting your own company, or whatever it may be that is important to you. 

It will always be tough. That‚Äôs life. But the question I like to ask is: what pain am I willing to put up with to do what‚Äôs most important to me? 

Perhaps simplifying life so that the financial burden is not as high, or looking for a job that is more aligned with your values. 

You always have a choice. Do I stay miserable or do I take some action to make it better? 

It can be just small things like helping others with your skills and knowledge or having a meaningful hobby on the weekends."

depression,f6w0qd0,t3_dt1d62,1573211275.0,I soooo agree! Well said! Sometimes I wonder how many people here actually want to take responsibility for their mental health and change their situation and how many prefer blaming everyone else for their problems...
depression,f6w0kph,t3_dt380e,1573211037.0,"Hey follow your heart! If you realize that this isn't the lifestyle you want (and you have a long list of reasons), change your career. Perhaps you can become a digital nomad and travel the world."

You have something to give the world! You will get another shot, ok? Can you focus on doing something for others? That's one of the best ways to relieve the pain. Help others and you will help yourself."
depression,f6vzz6c,t3_dtb47p,1573210110.0,"Hey there Sketch, I just want to say please don't give up ok? If you have not already tried I would recommend getting into mindfulness.

depression,f6vzpxl,t3_dtctdk,1573209696.0,I think therapy could definitely help. Another option would be to work with a life coach.

depression,f6vtj09,t3_dpl4bu,1573199877.0,"I can so relate to that. Except for two instances in my life I was always highly functional in my career.  I appeared to have it all together on the outside, but my soul was crumbling inside. 

All of this got better when I lived more authentically. When I started sharing who I really am. To my surprise this didn‚Äôt make people run away, but a lot of people felt closer than ever before. All of this through making myself more vulnerable. And the side effect I guess was that I learned to accept my sharp edges more, I get more purpose and didn‚Äôt feel as disconnected. 

Putting a mask on every day makes you feel disconnected from others. And I am sure that this is a major component of you feeling down when you are not at work. 

Does that resonate at all?"

Entrepreneur,f6t8xiq,t3_d8e796,1573145604.0,"This is such a common issue, but most don't talk about it. There has been a lot of press coverage on the mental health crisis among founders lately.

**I want to create a Mastermind for entrepreneurs who struggle with depression.** I have been looking for one, but can't seem to find one, so I am ready to take the first step. 

The idea would be to have a bi-weekly or monthly video call to talk about our mental health challenges and give each other tips and support. 

This is for you if you...

\- are ready to step up to get better and take full ownership of your mental health. 

This is not for you...

\- if you blame everything on your circumstances and you are not ready to do work to get better.

**Who's up for this?**"
