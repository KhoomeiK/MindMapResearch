Meditation,ep2y9zz,t3_btqeke,1559014364.0,"Honestly, I’d recommend to slow down your meditation somewhat if you’re starting to remember traumas from your childhood. A lot of people get overwhelmed from the influx of insights, and it can damage people emotionally in very harsh ways. Don’t go into long retreats without a good guide, and let yourself take a break if old memories like that resurface. Continue, but do so steadily."

Meditation,ep2wizg,t3_btr44s,1559013738.0,"It’s interesting how you can create your own noting techniques to become self aware on a lot of things. The only real rule is to place neutral categories for what you absorb, rather than good or bad terms. So if you’re always stressed out by the noise outside, you can gently note “sound.” If you are stressed due to some trouble making kids as a teacher, just gently note, “Anger.” It’s a good way to be self aware of any unhelpful habits you have or to become more aware of the helpful habits you don’t celebrate over."
Meditation,ep2voxc,t1_ep2lolb,1559013433.0,"Strange, because to be honest on what I read about him, I don’t hear him mention anything about those things you said he claimed. A lot of those things come from dirty rumors on him but not anything he directly written."

I guess learning how to communicate through writing and typing online with less filter helped me talk more over time.

Failure is how you learn anyway, so making mistakes is just part of it all. No one goes through life knowing the answers to everything, and honestly, while I tend to be well liked these days, I still think I have no idea what I’m doing.

I think one of the parts of being egocentric is that they believe everyone thinks about them, but do so in a way that praises them and puts them up in a pedestal, rather than constantly gossiping and criticizing them behind their back. There’s a difference."
mbti,eox1fmo,t1_eout8ag,1558917761.0,"So basically if Jung didn’t originally use cognitive functions, that means they’re automatically not valid.

Where did you even get the info about openness to experience? The OP had no mention of that. If other scholars took my work as a foundation for their ideas, I’d be flattered."
mbti,eox0tgq,t3_bt6lyg,1558917526.0,"It doesn’t depend on how much you use a function, but what functions you use more in comparison.

More mature types can use their lower cognitive functions better, but it still tires them out more easily to do so. I know it does."

mbti,eowzxpz,t3_bt8gdd,1558917169.0,"Fears, huh? I guess I worry about not becoming whole enough. I don’t really understand why, but I always seem to have a restlessness for more new things to try and more new things to learn. I’m terrible at knowing about my emotions, and honestly, I’m not really sure what I want. I just always seem charged with some level of nervous energy. I often convert it to excitement and risk taking for ideas, but I never really seem to be ever “satisfied” somehow."
mbti,eowytcd,t3_btenix,1558916760.0,I think it’s because intuitives are more likely to know about personality typing considering how abstract these ideas can be after all.

INTP,eowy62c,t3_btb0nc,1558916498.0,"Thinking does not mean intelligence.
Feeling does not mean kindness.

It’s a personality type, not an IQ test or a judgement of your character. Thinking just means you make decisions based on logic, whether that logic is really sound or not. Feeling just means you make decisions on emotion, whether it’s out of selflessness or selfishness. There are mature and immature people of all types really."
INTP,eowxlgi,t1_eovvtof,1558916290.0,"As someone in the gifted community, I also know that intelligence does not absolutely account for success either.

Meditation,eoww9b1,t3_btdwhe,1558915748.0,"Maybe it has something to do with Tratak meditation — a meditation used to focus on a certain external object. Maybe squinting allows you to focus your attention more. It makes it more likely for you to see flashes of color that tends to make a similar “trippy” sensation. Notice when you stare at something long enough, and you move your attention somewhere else, you see an after effect of a color? It’s a lot like that. It’s harmless though. Nothing to worry."
Meditation,eowvmkd,t3_bte01u,1558915499.0,"Nothing that wrong with small fidgets over the way. Just take the time to be aware of them, neither encouraging them or pushing them away.

Meditation,eowup4i,t1_eow3fap,1558915152.0,"I think apps are good for a lot of beginners though, or if they’re trying to get to know a technique. It’s hard to stay focused without a guide first, and what is even the difference between reading to a book and listening to a guide on this? Both allow for more groups of people to join in If someone was blind for example, wouldn’t things like this make things more accessible to them? Both share good ideas, just like Reddit has some good text based ideas. Though, after some time, people will have to master the meditations themselves without instructions."
Meditation,eowtz6u,t3_btba4o,1558914872.0,"I really liked the part about not taking things personally. I blame myself a lot on things to be honest, and have a lot of high standards on a lot of things, so that’s a relief. People aren’t critics of you often because they took the time to know you personally and reflect, but because they lived an entire life differently from you and see you through those lens. There’s no single scapegoat for a lot of the troubles in life. There are always multiple causes."
depression,eowsfng,t1_eowj8vh,1558914253.0,"Your self worth shouldn’t be overly dependent on others, but it’s impossible to go through life well without some emotional support and assurance. The point is to have quality friendships rather than quantity of friendships. Not everyone has to like you, but everyone needs some true love from at least a few people in their life. No man or woman is an island after all. There are a lot of people with mental health issues who’ve gone through so much bullying about seeking too much attention that they don’t seek help when they need to, so I hope you understand."
askphilosophy,eoug0ae,t3_bscw00,1558865186.0,Why can it not be called altruism if you’re also happy while making other people happy? Ever heard of John Nash’s zero sum game or win-win ideas in game theory? Would you mind defining altruism first to me then?
askphilosophy,eoufiin,t3_bsos7g,1558864747.0,"The no-self view is not a denial of identity. It is a rejection of a stable identity. Read Peter Ralson’s book on Buddhist philosophy if you’re confused. The idea of no self does not mean you have no personality, thoughts or feelings, but it means that your identity is not dependent on only a few things. You are not just black and white, not male or female, not interested in this sports team or another, and so on. The philosophy of no self is the idea that people don’t just stereotype others, they also stereotype themselves in a way that harms them. You’re not the “absentminded philosopher,” not the “funny fat guy” and not the “reserved British lady.” It’s not nihilism. It’s the opposite. It’s owning who you really are, and it’s something that cannot be summarized into words."
askphilosophy,eoueum5,t3_bsyoh4,1558864288.0,"I find it curious how atheists talk about how beliefs are dependent on culture when they only mention arguments from Christian philosophers, and never the ones from other religious philosophers and religious scientists. That sounds like a rather racist thing to me if you think about it."
askphilosophy,eouekzy,t3_bsxkyr,1558864094.0,"I say the nearest book for it is “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,” by Thomas Kuhn. It’s not that he disagrees with science, but the nature of science itself has to evolve. He researched patterns around the history of the development of science, and realized that a lot of scientists are biased by emotional gain more than thought. Some fear losing their jobs, being ostracized, being wrong, losing status, and so on to not be as accurate as many would think. It really makes you think how improving science is not by just improving the logic of it, but the emotional intelligence and strength of its scientists."
askphilosophy,eoue9xt,t3_bt4kof,1558863865.0,"Considering I know a lot of Western and Asian philosophies, I can answer your last question. Individualism is prized because Western philosophers have often focused on individualism following the path of the earliest Greek philosophers then. Collectivism is often prized in Asian countries because ancient philosophers like Confucius and Lao Tzu have followed suit with working together as a team. In truth, both have very good points. You have to make your own decisions and work together with others. Combining both, allows you to have the individualism to develop something unique onto yourself, and with collectivism, sharing it for the best of society."
askphilosophy,eoudmlr,t3_bszpiy,1558863354.0,"I have a similar background actually. Went to a specialized high school for STEM classes, and now I’m off having to get a BS in Information Technology for the next 3 years. Considering you’re clear on the logical side, let’s talk about the emotional side of persuasion. People won’t trust anything you say no matter how logical you are if they won’t like you. So focus on finding common agreements, letting them know you’re listening to them by summarizing their ideas back or just nodding and sharing your own personal reasons to gain some trust. It’s easier to get through people if you mention common arguments against your ideas already and then have an argument for it back. It lets them know that you listened to them."

Daemons remove negative energy and demons increase negative energy. Daemons are actually the genies or Jinn mentioned in Islamic religions. Ever heard of making a contract with a demon? It’s like making a wish to a genie. But I recommend not looking for them without a powerful escort on your side. Combinations of both are called Nephilim, and they are the most powerful.

You can tell they’re a good entity if you get a good feeling about them in your gut, and a bad one if you’re shaken. Trust your instincts. It could really help you. Check out Intuitive Souls if you want to know how to talk to your spirit guides and/or guardian angels if you want."
AstralProjection,eotowdd,t1_eml660v,1558845317.0,"I can answer those for you.

A) You mean astral projection schools? Oh, I’ve placed a lot of the information I learned in these schools in my past posts on Reddit if you want to see. Just check out my history. You don’t really get degrees there. You get to choose the course you want and they choose you. Some corporeal beings get chosen because they’re tasked with sharing this information to humanity. Not sure why I was chosen, but oh well.
B) Haha, that’s a story for another time. 
C) That’s the difference between Lucid Dreaming and Astral Projection.
D) Deities are rather friendlier than you expect really. They’re nowhere as strict and discriminative as a lot of religious zealots think they are. They’re rather displeased with how a lot of their Holy Books were rewritten with bullshit though, like LGBT discrimination or sexism. Just use your common sense when reading those books.
E) They’re intelligent, much more intelligent than most human beings are, and much more kinder. We’re above average in compassion though compared to a lot of other places, especially for the age of humanity actually. I think it’s because we have a lot of nicer ET civilizations guiding us in the background. 
F) Check out Collective Evolution, an alternative news website for more. And yes, they’re accurate. 
G) Check Collective Evolution also for this.
H) Gaia doesn’t talk herself, but I’ve talked to a representative of her. A lot of elemental spirits work under Gaia to guard nature. If anything, astrology works because planets have consciousness and are influencing us indirectly. They’re not all powerful, and they can’t intervene on free will, but they can deeply increase or decrease whatever motivations we have. 
I) Mission? I guess get whatever I’m taught from those astral schools to humanity if you ask me.
F) You mean sparring sessions? I’ve had some of those. But I’m told you aren’t ready to know about this yet. With great power comes great responsibility."

You can level up your character, gain weapons, and other items. If you join a group, not following through will lessen a group’s points and following through will increase it. Inspirational and motivational videos like Prince EA’s channel can work also. Though, sometimes in personal development, people just need a break to relax, have fun and socialize sometimes to get back to your spirits again. You worked hard. Reward yourself."

DecidingToBeBetter,eotcwg1,t3_bsw5sd,1558838953.0,"A lot of people in personal development just want shortcuts, when really just following the simple things and repeating them regularly is what allows for great things to happen anyway. A lot of people already know what’s best to do. They just don’t really take the time to do it."
DecidingToBeBetter,eotclrg,t3_bstbyv,1558838808.0,"Divide and conquer. What specific goals do you have and what steps do you have to reach there? SMART goals. Specific, measurable, accountable, reasonable, and timely. Meaning be specific, have something that allows you to tell whether you reached a goal, work with someone else to be accountable, be reasonable by splitting it into smaller actionable steps, and get into a regular schedule. Look up James Clear’s blog to know how to discipline yourself. Don’t do everything at once or you’ll give up quickly. Learn to prioritize on one or a few habits first, but for beginners to personal development, I’d say one or two. Make sure to notice your progress regularly, even with small wins to motivate yourself, and give yourself some regular feedback with deliberate feedback. 

I recommend checking up on cognitive behavioral therapy, and especially with a therapist. Look for online therapists if you’re too shy to meet them face to face."

By standing up for yourself, you also stood up for other people she affected. Because likely if someone is like this in one type of situation, they repeat the habit all throughout their life. Kindness that happens to people allows them to be kind to others until the cycle of kindness keeps continuing. The reverse is also true with being a terrible person. Think you don’t make a difference in others’ life and want some advice on being kinder? Then think about the ripple effect of your actions from now on."

Meditation,eot83it,t3_bswe5u,1558836613.0,"There are different techniques for different purposes. Both are equally valid. This is not a multiple choice test where there is only one answer to the question. There are multiple answers to the same question, and being well rounded is a generally good idea. If it works for you, it works for you. Also, Alan Watts is a really good lecturer. I recommend listening to a lot of his audio that’s everywhere in Youtube."

Meditation,eot4yq6,t3_bswe6m,1558835051.0,"It depends on what you need to focus on really. Sometimes focusing on an external object is good at default, but if your emotions keep going to another subject out of worry, then it might be a sign that you’re avoiding and running away from the very thing you should be thinking about the most. Sometimes it’s best to face it head on for it to really pass."

Meditation,eot3tz8,t1_eoqq6io,1558834508.0,"Yes, the point of meditation is not always relaxation, but awareness, and that’s not always pleasant. Often the uncomfortable awareness has to happen first before the relaxation part, which is part of why beginners gets so anxious on “Why is my mind not quiet enough???” The point of meditation was never silence, it’s the ability to find some space and relaxation whether your mind is loud or quiet."

Meditation,eot23k7,t3_bst7ql,1558833676.0,"Take this as an opportunity to focus on your emotions around money as a subject to meditate on. You’ll only figure things out if you realize the why behind these motivations. Are there any memories behind your reasons to think about money? What emotions are present? How intense are they, and is it changing intensity as it ebbs and flows. Don’t judge it as good or bad yet without reflecting. Just observe it for the time being so you can later figure out something to do with it.

Besides I’m 18, and actually at this age, we’re both stuck having to adapt to the new practical responsibilities we have, it’s normal. I started as a preteen though at 11, so can’t actually relate to your inexperience. Not focusing on your material wants doesn’t mean you shouldn’t focus on your material needs. Take care."

What’s most important is that you are more deeply aware of the nature of the question you’re asking, and not the answer."
Meditation,eoszsql,t3_bswh2h,1558832465.0,"My advice? Don’t get too attached to it. It’s not possible to feel such a surge of happiness all the time, and you can’t really expect it to. The con to this type of extreme joy is that you often don’t think things through as much and can have the habit of being so optimistic, you become naive. There’s a time and place for every emotion. More calmer types of happiness can suffice, and it’s essential to appreciate all types of happiness. Whether it’s love, amusement, being proud, gratitude, wonder, curiosity, hope, relaxation and so on and so on. Some say it’s essential to master each type of happiness. Meditation CAN make you happier though, but not always in ways you want to."
Meditation,eosz6g7,t3_bt14v5,1558832135.0,"There’s this stage in meditation where your focus increases and you become more observant of the environment. It’s uncomfortable at first, but it’s a sign of progress and the increased observation allows you to make better judgements. It’s awakening symptoms really. Look up the Arising and Passing stage of meditation."
