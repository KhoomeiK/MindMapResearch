 VTU engg student here. They are playing with our lives. We had no online classes just some pdf's from few teachers. Now, they want to us to write exams in june. In this situation, mental stress of many students. No proper internet connection, power cuts. They expect us to complete learn, write assignments and give online internals within this month. I'm so tired of this stupid system. They gave no proper instruction. Nothing, the DCM of karnataka says wait till 1st week of  june they will give details about examination. Aren't human lives more important than exams? We are doing online campaign #promotedegreestudents & #promoteVTUstudents for week now. I'm so done with the system that only cares about exams.

1. I like the simplicity of it, easy to play.

2. The homescreen is confusing like whether it's loading or not.

3. I really like the concept of picking up the characters.

4. Also, Maybe add something like levels & collecting this much coins.


To answer the specific questions

1. Art and visual is good. Old school feel. 

2. My current favorite game is pubg, I would rate it 8/10.

3. I like 1st character, I didn't get the pirate one.

4. I would change the font style, score. What is highway line for? More instructions"
