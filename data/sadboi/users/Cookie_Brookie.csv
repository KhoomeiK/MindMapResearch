Conservative,fqaibye,t1_fq9lwg5,1589219557.0,"I have a few examples of why my family needs guns.... A farmer we know keeps his cattle in the pasture behind our house. Not long ago, we had a coyote somehow get in there and it went after the cattle. My husband, of course, went straight for his gun. If it had attacked one, the farmer would've been out several thousand dollars. Had it chased them through a fence and multiple cows had been injured, he could have lost his entire livelihood. 

Our county is roughly 8000 sq km and 8000 people. For the entire county, we have one sheriff and 3 deputies. Law enforcement is VERY slow to respond to issues and the nearest stationed officer is typically at least 20 minutes away from us. Unfortunately, meth use is all too common in our area and break ins to steal and fuel drug habits aren't uncommon. If someone broke into my house in the dead of night high on meth, my family would be dead several times over before officers could arrive. There's just too few of them in too large of an area, so we have to rely on ourselves for protection. I don't know anyone who has ever had to shoot an intruder.... The knowledge that there's a gun in most households is enough to deter break ins while people are home.

Currently, we have a meat shortage in the U.S. In my deep freeze we have plenty of wild turkey and deer to get us by. Obviously, this isn't life or death...we could live without meat. But being able to hunt for food is great and saves a ton of money."

In my hometown, the school is providing lunches, so the two churches in town (Baptist and Christian) have teamed up to provide free dinner pickups for people of all ages. You just drive up, say how many meals you want, and off you go. I think they do it at least 3 times a week.

Similarly, If you're exploiting instead of helping, you're not a Christian, as Christians are to follow the teachings of Christ. The only time we see Jesus truly angry in the Bible, it was because he was furious over the temple being used for profit, not for the people. This isn't a small detail.

She isn't as bonded to our son as she's bred to be a working dog, but we've had her since she was 2 months old and know her history and how she handles different situations. 

My MIL has had her dog, a shelter dog, for over a decade and he can still be unpredictable. We aren't sure what happened to him when he was young, and it breaks my heart that he is so skittish still, but we just can't trust him around our 2 year old.

Our first boxer we got at 10 weeks. When we got our 2nd one a few months after we lost him, we got a 6 month old that had been returned to the breeder (breeder meaning middle aged couple with a male and female boxer they adored...this was their first litter). He was still a young enough pup that we were able to instill habits easily. We knew he had had a pretty stable life and had been treated well and he acclimated quickly.

He was introduced to our son when our son was very little and has been around him plenty, but we know we can never trust the dog around him.

When we got our boxer a couple years before our son was born, we got it because the breed has a good reputation as a family dog. The family we got him from had children and the parents were very gentle dogs. From the day our son was born, he was very attached and was a great big brother.

He passed shortly after our son turned one and we knew we wanted another one day. Things kind of fell into place and we got another about a year ago. He was 6 months old and hadn't been around little kids so we were cautious.

Just like literally every other boxer I've ever met, he was great with our son from day one. Our son is now 2.5 (boxer is 1.5, their birthdays are 2 days apart) and he LOOOVVEEES that dog. They cuddle and watch Mickey Mouse, they play fetch, our son sneaks him food at dinner....

Our coondog catahoula mix (got her when she was 2 months old and our son was about 9 months) is another story. I don't think she would ever hurt our son in any way, but she just hasn't bonded with him like our boxer. It just isn't who she is.... She was bred to be a working dog, not a companion.

I'm a firm believer in different breeds having different traits and I totally get why some of those traits work for some people but not others. I'm sorry, but I trust the purebred boxer that I've had most of his life and know has gentle parents and siblings to be around my child. 

I couldn't say that about a mixed breed older dog that has been through God knows what and is unpredictable. That dog deserves love and adoption, but wouldn't be a good fit for my family. I'm not doing him any favors by setting him up for failure. Why should I be ashamed of doing what's best for both myself and that dog?"
AskReddit,flznron,t1_flzf2rf,1585628333.0,">The breeder for my Aussie actually had a rehoming clause in our contract, that we could NOT sell/give the dog away. If we couldn’t take care of her anymore, we would have to bring the dog back to the breeder. 

This is how we came by our current good boy. We lost our boxer back in 2018 but love the breed and knew we wanted another one day. In March 2019 a friend's coworker's friend knew of a 6 month old male boxer who had been returned to the breeder. Sad situation all around, their daughter was very sick and they hadn't realized how much work boxers pups are, so back to the breeder he went.

The breeder (I use that term loosely, it's a couple in their 50s with a male and female boxer. They did it because they love the breed and want to see it continued. This was the first litter.) wanted him to go to a ""boxer person,"" someone who had raised a boxer before, cared about the breed's quirks, and knew what to expect. It just kind of happened.

It's been a full year now and we have the woman on Facebook. She still checks in on him from time to time and wants pictures! Breaks my heart that people like her get lumped in with the types of assholes that run puppy mills."

Anxiety,flyeydy,t3_frqh30,1585600896.0,"Social distancing has made my anxiety about a million times worse. Sometimes when I get anxious the best thing I can do is just go somewhere and do something...like just go to the gas station for a fountain coke, go visit my parents so they can see their grandson, or wander around the store to find something fun to cook or bake...

I am currently just home all day every day with myself, my thoughts, and my 2.5 year old. I've been a mess."
