your friend will really do appreciate your presence so much.

let her feel that you are thinking of her and care for her. 

stay with your friend in a couple of hrs - and the rest with your family. Christmas is not just one day. 

pls visit her"
depression,f83jhcg,t3_dyov3v,1574213406.0,"I feel you, before its very difficult for me to make some friends, and just to have friends, i have to please them and its hard, i dont feel good everytime i please them just for them to get friends with me. im 31 now and realize that I dont need to fit in and push my self just to please others. Now, I only have few friends but they are the best. in this life you dont need to have many friends but sucks, you just need a few but real. I hope that make sense.

thanks for reaching out, I can also be your friend. Hugss..."
