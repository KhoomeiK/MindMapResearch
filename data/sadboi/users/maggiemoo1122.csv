EatingDisorders,fq544ii,t3_gco3on,1589091909.0,"Eating disorders are a slippery slope. Before you know it your way below your goal weight, but you lack the knowledge and healthy relationship with food/exercise to recover as efficiently as possible. 

1)The first step is you need to see a doctor especially if you lost your period. The longer you lack a period leads to infertility. You could have other underlying issues that need to be assessed such as low heart rate, freezing, hair loss, weakness. If your family can't afford to go to the doctors, Google free eating disorder resources in your area. I highly recommend the YouTube channel This Girl Audra; she discuss a variety of topics surrounding eating disorders. 

2) I recommend getting a dietitian. You will need to put a plan in place. You need to learn how to nourish your body. Not having a period is an indication that you are in a fight or flight state, and you will need to eat according to rebalance your hormones. 

\- one thing I was reluctant to give up in my recovery was exercise. However, it just prolonged my recovery. When I gave up exercising, I got my period 3 months later. 

3) Eating disorders are mental. I went to one on one therapy every week. 

4) The last thing spiritual. I had a feeling journal, attended church, and hangout with friends & family. Do things that lift your mood. 

Remember the only thing constant is change. I'm glad you're taking action before things get worse. <3"
EatingDisorders,fq51971,t3_geh0bx,1589089446.0,"Congratulations hun, 

To get out of my safe food rut, I went out to eat at my favorite restaurant(s) a lot, made Pinterest recipes, and everyday I had an objective to eat a fear food. Honestly, I didn't worry about my nutrients too much because I have a tendency to become obsessed! A rule of thumb I follow now is the my plate diagram: 1/4 veg, fruit, grain, protein, calcium. 

I would also eat what ever I was given and eat the same meals of my friends. Following normal eaters really helps!"
EatingDisorders,fq4zz7s,t3_geh2s0,1589088442.0,"Since your friend was diagnosed, I'm pretty confident that medically she is being taken care of ( physical and mental). Its very common for ED patients to attend consulting/therapy. 

Never talk about her body! ED are not all the same; for example, I struggled with the triad and had zero body dysmorphia( it's very depressing seeing your body so malnourished). Additionally, she probably has already received comments about her body and how un-healthy she is, so she does not need that from her friend. You are her escape!! 

I think that it is fine to show concern( no crying - all love), but maybe once or twice at the most. For example, I had two male friends who asked if I was okay, what my recovery was, and that they loved me. It meant **a lot** to me. I felt cared for and visible. 

You need to help take her mind off her eating disorder instead of focusing on it.. trust me this is all she thinks about already. Eating disorders are often about control, so have her make the plans. 

Recovery is a journey and it doesn't happen over night! You're an amazing friend :)"
EatingDisorders,fq4xhnt,t3_gexpnq,1589086614.0,"For me, my main motivation for recovery was to regain my period! You need to find your reason to actively seek recovery! 

College is very social and as a freshmen you are in the perfect position to be meeting a lot of people. Within the first week of college everyone is trying to find their group! One thing I did that really helped during my recovery is eating with my roommate or friend for every meal. I also got involved in school clubs, which made me face fear foods (pizza). 

I completely quit all excessive exercise. I would walk to class, and on Saturday I would go attend a yoga session held by my rec center. 

Having fun with friends and diving into my studies really helped me to recover. I put my energy towards things that would build me up instead of tear me down. 

\-  Congratulations with this new chapter in life- also always order(rent) your textbooks from chegg or amazon instead of the bookstore."
EatingDisorders,fq4vlas,t3_ggd3em,1589085211.0,"During my recovery the best advice I received was to distract myself. My support system would supply me with meals throughout the day, and I would work on coding(something that I really enjoyed, but was also mentally stimulating).

For me, focusing of the eating disorder only amplified it. You are doing amazing with your recovery keep on progressing!!!!"
TrueOffMyChest,fq4up07,t3_gg6bhx,1589084591.0,"Honey, be carful you may be on the verge of bulimia. I understand you feel shamed, but throwing up can cause major damage to your teeth as well as your esophagus. 

There is nothing wrong with being flexible with your diet - You might want to consider calling yourself Plant Based- it's a bit more forgiving compared to vegan. 

Remember to eat food that make you happy and healthy(for the mind, body, and spirt). If something is causing you stress, you must minimize it. Buy non-dairy ice cream, or give yourself the freedom to eat dairy once in a while."
exvegans,fq4rfce,t3_gg0vz1,1589082414.0,"Vegans love to talk about food, but if all you do is fight then you need to change topics. Be honest with her about your feelings. HOWEVER, do not force her out of the cult. From personal experience, the only person you can change is yourself. She has to have interpersonal motivation about quitting veganism!!!! 

In time, her perspective will likely change!"
exvegans,fq4q8q4,t3_g8amm5,1589081658.0,"Just a little background I jumped into veganism during my eating disorder recovery. I was vegan for 4 years, and now I'm vegetarian/plant based. The reasons I left veganism was my health and social. 

I continue to care about animals, and your question is very leading(horror). Yes, I buy local eggs. I continue to drink almond milk. However, I'm completely fine with eating cake on my mother's birthday and going out for ice cream a few times a year. 80/20 rule- eat plant based 80% of the time and 20% enjoy life!"
exvegans,fq4ofrl,t1_fooo0li,1589080486.0,"Preach! the label ""vegan"" creates baggage on ones mental state (causing isolating behaviors), which affects those around you!

Additionally, ex-vegans love animals. Most have sacrificed for years, and more than likely they will source from sustainable farms."
exvegans,fq4n7ot,t3_g8had4,1589079888.0,"I agree with everything you said( vegan for 4 years, now vegetarian). Currently, I'm with my family who are very lax with the meals. However, I often felt very alienated when going out with friends and work colleagues, which is why I chose to eat food with diary/eggs. 

looking retroactively, I feel that my extreme-vegan diet was mentally stressful for me and the people around me. My friends would always try to cater to my dietary ""wants"", and I felt like a burden. 

In essence, I follow 80/20. I choose to eat vegan 80% of the time, and the other 20% is typically vegetarian. Personally, It was more Important to get ice cream with friends, go to a wine tasting, and so forth. I also believe when traveling it is important to experience the country's cuisine(My diet is very felixaeble when traveling internationally) . 

Remember you can do whatever you want. Good Luck in finding what works for you on this journey of life. :)"

harrystyles,flcelon,t1_flcckhb,1585028058.0,"I completely agree with your points, but the four boys have a very strong connection, and Louis, Liam, and Niall have not reached as much success post 1D as Harry or even Zayn. Personally, I think as the boys age they will be more likely to comeback!"
harrystyles,flcd8v7,t3_fnz9ra,1585026772.0,"I don't think the boys will comeback in 2020 because Harry is currently on his Fine Line tour, and a lot of artist might cancel upcoming concerts due to COVID-19. 

I think it is most likely that they will come together, IDK about Zayn, in 2022 Harry, Liam, and Niall will be 28 and Louis will be 30. I think they will produce a short album and at least 2 music videos. They will do a world wide stadium tour during the summer. The music will be a mix of old, individual, and new. Overall, it would be very successful by brining all the old Directioners out of the woodwork; additionally, all of us have grown up so we have that money to spend!!"
