OCPoetry,ev2k1du,t3_ci5yrc,1564178342.0,I like the fact that you write without filters but still maintain a manner of discretion among decent word play...well done
OCPoetry,ev2jt6f,t3_ci6myr,1564178194.0,"Very good story-telling.

You rely a little too much on techniques to keep the poem from being too much prose.

I would prefer greater effort in choice of language, and use that to achieve a poetic feel without looking  contrived.

Still, a very good piece. It engages the reader and holds his attention--which so many do not do!"
