I actually kept them because I wanted to repurpose them into an art project. But the lady at Fuzzy's took them away because she gave us new straws and wanted to prevent underage drinking. We had a verbal agreement that she would set them aside and I could come back for them. She threw them away when I went back for them once we were done. And then she tried to pretend like it wasn't a big deal or that we had that agreement. Trash people should go in the trash."

Composting should always go before recycling, because recycling is a mechanical process that produces carbon emissions while composing generally does not. If you want to find a clever way to reuse those plastic bags, I'd recommend looking into plarn. Plarn is a product you can make by cutting plastic bags into loops and looping them together. You can mail plarn balls to people who will weave them into soft mats for the homeless. Also, if you want to go really crazy, there are schematics out there for turning plastic bits into filaments used for 3D printers."

But I go up to the meat counter and (yeah I still eat chicken) ask for them to put it in my container. So unless I stop the person, he will put the meat in a plastic bag, weigh it, and then dump it in my container because he can't press the 1 button to tare weight my container on the scale...."
