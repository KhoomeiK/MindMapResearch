It is against Reddit rules, and we can get in trouble.  No one has done anything wrong in this thread, I just like to get out ahead of problems that we have sometimes. 

Hope everyone is having the best day possible, hang in there, be kind to yourselves."
BPD,fqzknxm,t3_glsjfp,1589769415.0,"The following is NOT MEDICAL ADVICE.This is just my observation from a few years on this board, and my personal experience. 

Medication, in general, seems to be great for people who have BPD with comorbid conditions. If you have depression, anxiety, etc, medication can treat those symptoms.  If mood instability is one of the main problems someone with BPD has--if it is a key symptom for them--mood stabilizers seem to be great.

It isn't for everyone, because psych meds are hit and miss. Let's take depression as an example. The typical med to start is an SSRI.  For many, that will be al they need. Sometimes the first med works. Sometimes the 4th one does.  Sometimes the side effects are too nasty, so you have to try again. It is a game of sorts, and it is very common for people to need multiple tries of multiple meds to help.

Over time, meds can stop working and you need to find a new one, or adjust the dose.  

I recommend meds, but that is just me.  If you can do it with therapy alone, awesome, but I haven't been able to.  Sounds like Lexapro is working, and it is up to you to decide if you want more help, less help, or to continue on the path.  

This is a long story about my opinion:  meds are a double edged sword, but they can be extremely helpful if you are willing to play the game to find the right ones."

I had never heard of ""Bipolar 3"" before now, so that may be why doctors have told you it is not (they may just not know).  Also, the terminology may vary by country, and I don't know where you live.  

It sounds like depersonalization/derealization, which is dissociation. It does not mean anything is seriously ""wrong,"" you aren't having a stroke or anything, but it is definitely something to mention.  It is common in those who had abusive childhoods.  It is also common among people with BPD, which is widely believed to be highly correlated, if not significantly caused by, childhood trauma/neglect.  BPD involves mood swings, which, though they are not the same as Bipolar 1 (both in presentation, cause, and treatment), can be similar to 2 and 3 in more ways.  I only mention this as a possibility, if I am way off base, please disregard.

COVID19_support,fqwb92k,t3_gl7xe7,1589698405.0,"Only you can make that decision. However, mental health is incredibly important.  I visit my parents once a week, and the 3 of us have made that conscious decision together.  We grocery shop rarely, and do takeout once a week, so it's not like we are at high risk, but we understand that by seeing each other we increase our risk.  This is something that some people need to do (for example, I live with mental illness, and chronic suicidality means I absolutely need to see my parents). For many, especially older Americans, the loneliness can be too much to bear. 

Human life is not always about absolutes, though we do need to think of each other.  Do what you need to do, wash your hands, do the best you can while in public (if you and I are wearing masks, and we stay as many feet apart as we can, we can protect your boyfriend and my parents, as well as each other)--and then cut yourself some slack.

We all made different decisions, and depending on who you ask, the coaches would come out looking very different.

There are some gymnasts who seem to take their gym lives in stride, while those same gyms and coaches, and events, become huge problems for others.  I have no trouble believing a tough, even abusive gym has many gymnasts who nonetheless were content with the way things went, though others suffered trauma.
