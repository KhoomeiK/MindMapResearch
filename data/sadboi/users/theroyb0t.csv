1. Constant Criticism Can Lead to Divorce.

When you get a warning light on your car’s dashboard, that means there is something wrong under the hood that needs immediate attention. One of the greatest “warning lights” in a marriage is a tone of constant criticism. When a wife and husband start being each other’s biggest critics instead of the biggest encouragers and when they start focusing only on the negative instead of the positive, it creates a downward spiral that actually leads to divorce.

2# is something many married couples do as soon as they get married, but they do not realize they are just preparing themselves for divorce…


2. Dividing Everything Into “Hers” and “ his” Could Lead to Divorce.

When a wife and husband have separate bank accounts, separate hobbies, separate dreams, and separate friends they’re running the risk of creating completely separate lives. Marriage is about combining; divorce is about dividing. The more you can share with each other, the stronger your marriage will be.

3# is the reason there is an epidemic of divorce among couples who have been married for 25 years or more… ” divorce and children ”

3. Putting the Marriage “On Hold” While Raising children Can Lead to Divorce.

I’ve seen too many marriages fall apart because two well-meaning people put so much focus on their children that they forgot to keep investing in their marriage. Some married couples reduce their relationship to a partnership in co-parenting, and when the children finally grow up, they discover that they have created an empty nest and an empty marriage and we know that nothing is worse than ” divorce with kids ”. So give your kids the gift that comes from seeing their parents in a loving, thriving marriage. Model the kind of marriage that will make your children excited to be married someday.

4# might be the most common (and the most dangerous) habits that lead to divorce on the list… ” Divorce help ”


4. Giving Each Other Your “Leftovers” Could Lead to Divorce.

Some married couples have what I call a “cable company marriage.” Have you ever noticed how Cable TV companies seem to give you their very best service and deals at the beginning of the relationship but after the “introductory period” ends, they give you as little as possible to still keep you around? Some couples were great at giving their best at the beginning of the relationship, but as time goes on, they start giving the leftovers. Strive to keep giving your best things to each other. Grow deeper in your love, your friendship, and your respect through all the seasons of a good marriage.

5# is toxic and when it happens, neither spouse is going to have happiness or peace…

5. Holding Grudges and “Keeping Score” Could Lead to Divorce.

If you’ve been married longer than 15 minutes, chances are good that your spouse has done something to offend you and you’ve done something to offend him/her. When our words or actions cause harm, we need to be quick to admit fault and seek forgiveness. When your spouse has wronged you, you need to offer grace quickly so that trust can start being rebuilt and there’s no room for bitterness to take root in your heart. Don’t use past hurts as ammunition in arguments. Let grace flow freely in your marriage. No marriage can survive without it.


6# reveals the WORST place marriage advice comes from…

6. Trusting Your “Feelings” More Than Your Commitments Can Be the worst Habits That Lead to Divorce.

There are going to be days when you might not “feel” like being married, but feelings are fickle and they were never intended to be our primary advisor in major decisions. “Feelings” often lead people into adultery. The healthiest married couples have discovered that love is a commitment; not just a feeling. Their commitment to each other perseveres regardless of what they’re feeling. The strength of that commitment allows them to have a deeper intimacy, a happier marriage, and a stronger connection.

7# happens with pride replaces thoughtfulness in the relationship…

7. Making Decisions Without Consulting Your Spouse may Lead to Divorce.

Our pride can convince us that we do not have to answer to anyone, and we should be able to make decisions without consulting anyone. Pride has been the downfall of too many marriages. The healthiest married couples have learned that EVERY decision they make as individuals will have some level of impact on each other, so they respectfully and thoughtfully consult each other in every decision.


8# frustrates BOTH spouses, but doesn’t help either one of them…

8. Trying to Change Each Other Can Be the Habits That Lead to Divorce.

When you try to “change” your couple, you will BOTH end up frustrated. As you have probably learned already, you can not change each other; you can only love each other. The only part of your marriage you have the power to change is what you see when you look in the mirror. Be willing to change your responses to your spouse’s behavior. Look for ways to serve and love each other even when you have differences of perspective or preference. You will both probably end up “changing” for the better in the process.

9# is the biggest single step toward an eventual divorce…

9. Planning an Exit Strategy.

The healthiest married couples have removed the “D-Word” (Divorce) from their vocabularies.

More Habits That Lead to Divorce…

When we threaten divorce ( uncontested divorce ) or when we silently start fantasizing about life with someone new, we are ripping apart the foundation of our marriage. The couples who make it work aren’t the ones who never had a reason to get divorced; they’re simply the ones whose commitment to each other was always bigger than their differences and flaws.

10# doesn’t necessarily involve sex, but it’s still an act of infidelity…

10. Hiding the Fact That You are Married may Lead to Divorce.

If you are intentionally hiding your status as a married person or you’re projecting “availability” through flirting, acting single around your single friends or at bars, slipping off a wedding ring,… etc., then you’re WAY out of bounds. Those subtle acts of deceit are forms of infidelity even if they never lead to a sexual affair.

I’m convinced that #11 is the #1 cause of divorce… ( ” divorce legal advice”)

11. Selfishness Can Lead to Divorce.

We are ALL selfish by nature, but a marriage can only work when we put our selfishness aside and put the needs of our couple ahead of our own needs. When BOTH couples are willingly to selflessly love and serve each other in this way, the marriage will thrive. The hard part is that YOU have to be willing to go first and be selfless even in those moments when he/she is not reciprocating. Your actions might turn the tide. Choose to be a THERMOSTAT; not a thermometer. A thermometer always adjusts to the climate in a room, but thermostat CHANGES the climate in the room. Be the change. You probably have more influence than you think! But if you don’t have the ability to give up your selfishness, then you will definitely go looking for ” divorce lawyers”. Or ” family and divorce lawyer” or ” child support lawyer” if you have children."

Your question is fair tho. IMHO I think you should look for the best cpu you can get for the money rather than the type of computer it is. Try to look for something with an 8th generation intel i7 8750 and if you can’t afford that at the very least a decent quad core intel.

Again, this may not be pleasing to a western scale but it is pleasing to someone while there is a mention of non uniformed progression I’m sure that the musicians will get into some kind of “groove” for lack of a better term.

I never defined silence as music. I said absence of rhythm or having a lack of rhythm. You defined silence as music, I did not. Silence can be used in music for tension or other uses defined by the artist. But I never mentioned silence as anything other than something lacking; harmony, rhythm, and melody.

And every sound does have a pitch. At least in the earths atmosphere. even when there is a lack of atmosphere you can still get a radio frequency from something out in the universe which can then be put to pitch. although we can only hear roughly 20 Hz to 20 kHz which in the grand scheme of things is not much.

musicproduction,fa2anbw,t3_e7o5ir,1575779805.0,"My advice: get off the screen and onto the street. Hit local artists up, give beats away for free. Watch Curtis king YouTube, Katoonthetrack, successful producers give so much information away to the community for free. The info is out there. But you have to hustle to get a beat sold. Unless your beat is a masterpiece. Which I’m sure it is. No one is gonna buy it because there are 10 million other masterpieces by people with a bigger notoriety. the nature of the beast is not friendly. I’m at a similar stage like you."

AskReddit,f0369u2,t3_d3fnaw,1568345946.0,"I like a clean house. I put effort into cleaning while I cook Or clean up the messes I make. When I’m done with a wrapper or can of whatever I make a decision to throw it away instead of just putting it on the coffee table. When my garbage is full I take it out. 

I go by the motto. It doesn’t have to be fun but it has to get done.

everything in my life is on fire. But I have a clean house so that’s one thing I do not have to worry about."
