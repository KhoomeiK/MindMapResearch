BPD,fol42dx,t1_fokpmw2,1587854476.0,"I feel this.

I did a lot of work on myself to control my emotions between the ages of 17-23, I wasn't diagnosed but I knew I had problems. I was given birth control pills and it had such a bad emotional reaction I let my family know I never wanted to be on any BC after that again.

I met my ex at 26, told him my struggles, told him about the bad reaction to BC, and told him my triggers and what to do. He ignored it all because he thought I was being dramatic and couldn't possibly be that bad. A doctor bullied me into BC, ex said it was none of his business, and I went off the rails. My ex was abusive mentally and emotionally and was raping me by coercion a fair bit.

It hurt and sucks. But the most painful part was realising my family dismissed my change in my behaviour back to my teenage years as nothing to worry about. That proved to me how truly worthless I am. They didn't notice all the hardwork I did just to function."

I once changed my mind for my ex about having children but warning him that I, and my body, will react badly to being pregnant, it's a disturbing realisation that you are most likely going to be a mother who would drown her children in the bath. He saw a glimpse while I was on hormonal birth control - he admitted he thought I was being dramatic until then. Thankfully I don't have children to him, ended up with PTSD from his emotional abuse.

When I die and my family gets my Facebook log in, I sometimes wonder if they'll even stumble across them or just lock as legacy page and not notice the posts."
BPD,f1cjweq,t3_d8suzq,1569359111.0,"My first official night away from home, about 6 years old I think, I went to a friend's house. I always thought her mother was nice and she could sew clothes for her daughters' Barbie dolls.

After dinner, we played Barbies in her room, the mother came in to tell us to start getting ready for bed. She saw the mess in the room and just went off, pulled her daughter up by the arm and started to kick her on the bottom screaming how the room was a mess after she spent all day cleaning it.

I'd never seen anyone treat a child like that! I cried and was given ice cream to calm down while my friend had to clean her room. Took me years to tell my family what happened. Dad dismissed it because that was normal for his childhood (he broke the cycle) and my Mum decided that wouldn't have bothered her so I was clearly ""too sensitive"".

I learnt: I have no intuition about people, obviously I can't trust myself to 'know' the 'bad' people. I now freak out about being lied to and people being different behind closed doors. Add in persistent depression and general anxiety and yet grew up being told ""nothing is wrong with you, you wish there was so you can be special, you're such a drama queen"".

My parents know my ex lied to me but I also know they don't believe in gaslighting so they don't think it's that bad, that I'm probably overexaggerating what he was like behind closed doors. Nor do they know he likes a crying girl who just doesn't say no, that I spent many years being yelled at if I said no to sex (BC removed my libido but he didn't believe me) so sometimes I'd just lay there and not say no to get it over with. That when playing around he'd hold my wrists in one hand for a moment too long and look me dead in the eyes as if to say 'see how easy I can hold you down with one hand, I could easily take anything I want if I chose to'. I don't ever plan on telling many people about the raping - some don't believe it's rape, some always saw me be crazy and disportionitly anger at him due to his gaslighting, some think he's a really lovely guy and I know I'll never convince them otherwise, and I got told by a guy that's it's just what men do and there's a reason comedians joked about the difference between men and women libido.

I do know who I am: I'm a mess who's never going to get better, too afraid of a relationship and yet very lonely. I am worthless."
CysticFibrosis,f17hz2z,t3_d7zbuc,1569243136.0,"As someone in Australia, we just petitioned to have Kalydeco added to our PBS with hopes of Orkambi added soon. Medicare is brilliant and every country should have it but medications still have to be decided on for our PBS. As medications become available, the government still has to work out the cost of the medicine vs how many people will use it vs lifetime cost to hospitalised someone.

When I filled out my reasons I pointed out the main one of helping when young (only available for certain ages so far) leads to a much less burden on health services in the future. Therefore allowing more money to go into research for cures or cheap made medications that are virtual cures.

Having said that, cost of hospitalisation and equipment subsidiary is made much MUCH easier with our Medicare system.
