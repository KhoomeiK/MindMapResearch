eu4,fr26hsb,t1_fr2553y,1589831977.0,France can be a good choice. In this playthrough I allied with Austria and Poland for most of the game. Hungary can be useful too but they generally rival you.
eu4,fr25xh4,t1_fr2471a,1589831706.0,"Actually I have pretty strong opinions with Venetian names in eu4 haha. A lot of them are not patrician names which results in weird doges like Giuseppe Casanova or Mose Magno or whatever. There's even a legit typo in the files (Moncenigo instead of Mocenigo).

I'm probably the only one to care. But I do care. (Probably because I spent months studying patrician careers at the Archivio di stato haha.)"
eu4,fr1pfnh,t1_fr1h3ii,1589823713.0,"Venice is also getting several new provinces like Ravenna, Zadar or Padua. 1.30 will be very interesting for Venice players."
eu4,fr104x2,t1_fr0vki9,1589810610.0,"Sure.

First thing, I made sure I was mostly uncontested in my home trade node. In this case, I took Milan, Urbino, Mantua and Ferrara. That gave me the 93% control you see on the image, there's just no one contesting me.

After that, I focused on controling the trade nodes in the Eastern Mediterranean by taking other important trade cities, like Ragusa, Thessaloniki, the Nile delta, etc., as well as provinces that Venice historically targeted, like Cyprus (I'm kind of roleplaying this). Although Cyprus & Negroponte have no inherent trade bonus, I use them to get easy trade power in Aleppo and Constantinople with trading posts. And they are islands, so they were safe from the Ottomans.

So anyway, after I controled the Med with my 21 provinces-in-states, I took Sharqyia and Suez (as territories) from the Ottomans. This happened pretty late in this particular game because the Ottomans blobbed hard, so I fought several wars to a draw (usually as the defender). But then again, I had them just in time to build the Suez canal! But ya it would've been better for me to take them from the Mamluks.

I also have other several territories, especially the Genoese Crimean holdings & eventually trade cities in the Gulf of Aden (+ Zeta, which I got from an AI peace deal). They don't give that much trade power themselves, but they deny it from others, so my light ships have less competition.

Because yeah, I have an insane amount of light ships. I have around 450 in total. In Gulf of Aden I have over 100. I also have a massive war fleet, including 140 galleys (thanks to the Venice bonus to galleys) & around 50 threedeckers. The naval trade limits are just a suggestion at this point, but even then, it's almost at 500.

So anyway, after building the Suez canal, I bought a province in the Coromandel trade node, then proceeded to betray Vijaynagar & took most of the trade cities in the node. Followed by conquests and light ship spam in Gulf of Aden, that already meant that a lot of trade was going my way through Alexandria. I then took provinces in Bengal and Malaysia, and turned most of the commerce coming through Malacca in the direction of Alexandria.

As far as ideas go...

1) Maritime, mostly to make sure my fleet can defeat the Ottomans'.

2) Economic, for the development bonus, as I'm playing tall (most of my provinces have 40+ development).

3) Plutocratic

4) Innovative, mostly for the 20% infantry combat ability policy

5) Trade, because I'm building a trade empire after. I didn't take it earlier because the merchants are kind of wasted until you get to the Indian Ocean.

6) Quality

7) Offensive

8) Naval"
