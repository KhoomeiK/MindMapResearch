RedDeadOnline,f0bjnf3,t3_d4gol7,1568527932.0,"I was in a BH mission and I couldn't target at the guy. I tried throwing dynamite at him, lasso, fire bottles.. nothing worked.. the timer ran out and I failed it I also can't set up camp sometimes. Some of them are bugged. Maybe that's why you ain't getting the XP for it"
RedDeadOnline,f0bgln0,t3_d4gdma,1568526773.0,"This happened to me and then even when I tried to change the location of the camp it would be stuck on changing it and I'd be left without one, which was shit when I had collected pelts for the trader role.. I tried changing to a different server/loading in new location.. nothing worked.. I logged back on a few hours later and my camp was wherever I selected it. Maybe it's a bug"

RedDeadOnline,f0b4gvp,t1_f0b366v,1568522387.0,I'm really not bragging lol I'm just saying that I've been playing a while and never had this problem. I added my level for reference and to show I wasn't being petty. You're obviously new to this sub and you sound like a weirdo. Go be level 15 somewhere else. We don't want your dusty ass and scrawny nag around here.
RedDeadOnline,f0b2j10,t1_f0atqlq,1568521729.0,"No, I am the posse leader. I didn't enter a free aim lobby. I was in showdowns where the auto aim is usually working. I'm level 210, I've played up until this point with no problem with auto assistance, it happened out of the blue. I joined all the showdowns, changed all my settings, restarted PS4.. in free roam I'm able to lock onto animals, but no players"
RedDeadOnline,f0as0pa,t1_f0ari23,1568518183.0,What do you mean by that??? The game has been specially around auto aim lol.. except for auto aim in one showdown?
RedDeadOnline,f0arehx,t3_d4f869,1568517981.0,"If you move your camp and hunt around that area, trading in your materials is sell worth IMO.. especially because the pelts don't have to be perfect"
RedDeadOnline,f0aqxxb,t3_d4f9s3,1568517835.0,I'm sorry I didn't understand your question. Go into camp and the butcher table should be there?

I don't care how sorry she is, she didn't give you a second thought while another man's hands were all over her. How could you even touch your partner knowing they've still got the other persons bacteria all over them... I just cannot understand it..."

depression,ey7m0or,t1_ey7lsvw,1566889102.0,Relationships can really screw you up.. I've been there. The worst place to be is in your own head sometimes! Being aware of your thoughts and just letting yourself feel your emotions helps. I often ask myself if I am being rational or has anxiety ran away with a thought and added 50 million non existent problems to it lol. You'll get there.. I'm sure you'll be great together.
depression,ey7llk1,t3_cw0irv,1566888541.0,"You aren't alone. I've felt like this in every relationship I've been in. I don't think it's anything we truly overcome because it's in our nature to focus on the negatives.
My only advice I would give from my experience is... enjoy it! You are so lucky to have a wonderful girlfriend in your life. It's such a waste of time constantly worrying. I know it's easier said than done. I can never take my own advice. But if there's anything I've ever learnt it's to live in the moment. If it messes up then that's how it is. But this is here and now.. enjoy and appreciate it. Be aware of your thoughts and try and talk yourself out of them. Good luck!"
