Firearms,fq05n3m,t1_fq035re,1589027883.0,"Yeah that‚Äôs basically the only other actual applicable thing I could think of doing other than the psych evals. The only issues I see with that (not me personally, I used to carry before my card got suspended) are that gun grabbers/people on the fence won‚Äôt take that as a serious answer. They‚Äôre response is always ‚Äúso your answer is to have more guns. Gotcha‚Äù being all sarcastic and shit, and I personally am actually trying to come together with those people instead of constantly against them like how things seem now. Also, the other sort of issue I see with that is I personally feel if someone is afraid/doesn‚Äôt like guns, doesn‚Äôt want to carry one, doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with them, I feel like they have that right. I‚Äôm not gonna force someone to be a gun owner. And that kind of implys the answer to gun violence is to be armed yourself (which, it kind of is...), and since everyone is capable of being a victim of gun violence, everyone should therefor carry a gun. And that contradicts my belief that someone should be able to choose if they want to own a gun. If I‚Äôm standing next to them when something goes down, I‚Äôll happily defend their life as well as mine (or I guess I would if I still had my permit). But their choice to not own a gun is also their choice to be a victim in my opinion."
