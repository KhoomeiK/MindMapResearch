Mindfulness,fdpbai3,t3_emjx4k,1578624343.0,"The point is to keep you grounded as you watch your thoughts pass you by. Noticing that all thoughts are not good or bad, they just are. Try to watch yourself watching your thoughts pass. You are the watcher. Hence, try to watch the watcher. Not easy, but useful."
depression,fdp9sl6,t3_emaudf,1578623335.0,"Your personality is simply the perception you have of yourself and the perception you want others to view you as. When you attach yourself to your personality you start being controlled by your thoughts. Depression didnt steal your personality, it simply changed your own perception of yourself."
depression,fdp8jl9,t3_eb0ggo,1578622510.0,"I wish I could share my mind with everyone in this never ending cycle. Up until a year ago I spent my life waiting for the day I gained the balls to kill myself. I reached a dead end. I had nothing to live for and I was willing to try anything to make it stop, even to throw a bottle of pills down my throat. It's funny though. We never actually step back from our thoughts and see what's actually happening. We try so hard to be in control of our lives and attach ourselves so heavily to our thoughts. What we never notice is that no matter how hard we try to control our thoughts, it never works. We could be sitting in bed, and our mood and motivations and desires may change hundreds of times and we arent even aware of it. We are just living in a non real fantasy land letting whatever pop into our head dictate the world around us, when in reality, what's around us never changed. Our personality is the perception we have of ourselves. When u can realise a thought is neither good nor bad, it just is, then you can finally be free. Try not feeling bad for yourself and try just watching how your thoughts control you. When you notice how much your mind resists it, you will start to wake up. Most resist and convince themselves it's stupid and ""wont work for me.""  But the mind isnt accurate, so try not listening to it for once. Look into mindfulness, it's the only way to truly be free. You'll realize how we are all addicted to the pain, and like any addiction, u gotta accept it first"
