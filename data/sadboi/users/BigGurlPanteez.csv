ADHD,evyudk0,t1_evyu9y9,1564941638.0,Thanks for this advice!  I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll be much more careful after this scare.
ADHD,evyu7k9,t1_evyu66e,1564941521.0,Thanks!  I‚Äôm just so glad I found them!!
ADHD,evytokd,t1_evytgk1,1564941154.0,Thanks.  He just started meds when school got out and he has done so well.  My heart was breaking thinking I‚Äôd have to send him back to school with out them.  So glad I found them.
Anxietyhelp,evhfqav,t3_cjx2wm,1564525653.0,I deal with not being able to eat when I‚Äôm anxious also.  I wish I had a magic trick.  I don‚Äôt.  Maybe try nibbling on something off and on throughout the day instead of expecting yourself to have a meal.

AskReddit,eunp7sz,t3_cgu4bz,1563931732.0,Get a full psych evaluation to be sure you aren‚Äôt misinterpreting depression/ADHD/other mental health issues as laziness.   Thought I was a lazy fuck my whole life.  Diagnosed and medicated for depression and adhd. Magic! I‚Äôm not a lazy fuck.  I‚Äôm a person with a dysregulated brain.
TattooDesigns,eudo4p1,t1_eudnju1,1563723033.0,I like this idea!  Definitely adds something new to my idea bank.  Thank you.

Anxietyhelp,esydou2,t3_c9fthf,1562342244.0,"I don‚Äôt know what you can do but I can tell you late afternoon/early evening/ dusk used to (and sometimes still does) have the same effect on me.  I seem to associate this time of day with ending and sadness.  I don‚Äôt know why.  Luckily this only seems to last for me until full dark (so maybe an hour) not the 5-10 hours you‚Äôre struggling with.  The only thing I can think of that might help is to set a routine to do something you really enjoy at that time, relaxing bath, favorite show, special food you enjoy, craft or hobby, whatever.  Distraction is a major tool for me when coping with my anxiety.  I hope you find this helpful.  Best wishes for relief."

Anxietyhelp,ertuwpy,t3_c3r29x,1561254013.0,I‚Äôve started a bullet journal.  Search Pinterest for mental health bullet journal layout.  It has really helped me.
Anxiety,epemq15,t3_buklwx,1559184536.0,"Been there more than once.  Depression and anxiety with depersonalization and derealization.  It‚Äôs so, so hard.  I didn‚Äôt do it alone.  I was blessed with the support of my spouse, family, friends, and work-family.  I can‚Äôt imagine having to do it on my own.  If you‚Äôve done that, you are a genuine bad-ass!!! If you‚Äôve done it with help you are still a bad-ass, but a blessed one."
Anxietyhelp,ep2h6q7,t3_btos7c,1559008315.0,Good for you for getting out there and doing it.  Best wishes!!

schoolcounseling,eouv3la,t3_bt786o,1558881649.0,I‚Äôve just finished my 10th year working with 3rd-5th graders.  I‚Äôm in Texas but would be happy to answer any you have that I have an answer to.  My campus will become a K-5 year after next so I‚Äôm going to be needing suggestions and ideas too.
