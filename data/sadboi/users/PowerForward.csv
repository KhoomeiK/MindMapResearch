Illidan is the only one of the 10 that I’d say is a clear upgrade from the default golden and is worth the grind. All the others are honestly kind of bad. The images are done in a different style that makes it look worse in a way I’m not smart enough to explain. The default goldens are just prettier and more dynamic imo.

How does a guy who was consistently in the top throughout the whole competition get eliminated after just one bad showing? It pissed me off and he looked really mad too which is probably why he never came back on the show. And the tattoo that sent him home wasn’t even that bad lol! The wolf’s face was fucking great it’s just the neck area that was a little lazily done. The fact that he had no tattoos definitely had to factor into his elimination there’s no doubt about it because he shouldn’t have been sent home before Sebastian and Baby and that’s OBVIOUS. If he had made it to the finale I wouldn’t have been surprised if he ended up winning the title. Of all the contestants on the show I feel the most pity for him and I l’d love if he came back in the future and wiped the floor with everyone."
