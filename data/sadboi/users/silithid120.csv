What I'm saying is, if  you're mastubating, stop it, it causes depression and sacks your body of vital nutrients, thats why doctors recommend it and say its good, then they can get you on they're specific crazy pills (depression pills, whatever pills etc). Check out the no-fap community for more on this subject. IT works for guys and girls alike.

Then try to sleep enough hours a night at good enough sleep intervals ( like fall asleep at max 1 am) and sleep at least 7 hours if not 8, is ideal.

Third, eat well. Get protein from meat and fiber in your diet from wheat, cereals with milk in the morning. Check out various recipes on the internet and dietary advice on the matter on youtube.

Appreciate things more, your family that provides food and shelter for you, be more appreciative of your surroundings and everything you have, don't take anything for granted, for one day you could not have anything, or lose everything, God forbid. Gratefulness eliminates depression, because it makes you serious about the things in the world around you, at least just so that you can know what to appreciate. And that provides clarity.

And lastly for more concepts like these,that teach you how to start being aware of things, start watching Jordan Peterson on youtube. And start reading the things he recommends and you will see how magically your mind will start working because it was never broken just dormant under sufferings yet unspoken. Words are important. How and what you say about yourself is how you think about yourself thereafter. Through words we form the world around us from the cognitive structure of our psyche. 

You might want to consider getting a therapist when and if you have money. For me it has been at least as helpful as doctor Peterson's lectures."
