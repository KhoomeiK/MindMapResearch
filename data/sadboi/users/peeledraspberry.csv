AskReddit,fq9zfsx,t1_fq9z13u,1589210026.0,"Dude I grew up fat and tired. My parents are lower middle class at best and had no idea about healthy nutrition. That’s how I ended up weighing 220lb at 12 years old. I took charge of my body at 16, and dropped to 160. I am now at about 175 (22 years old). I eat very healthily, take care of my macro and micronutrients. But I feel like to lose those last couple pounds that I don’t like I would need to exercise. I have never been a fan of exercise because I was always very shy and obviously self-conscious about my body - still am to some extent. Do you have any idea for motivation to work out?

edit: I did of course exercise during my intense weight loss time at 16. I bought myself weights, a bench, a cycling/rowing machine and worked out 4 times a week. I sadly had to get rid of everything when my parents moved and now I have no space in my flat to have all this. I only have a few short bells left. Going to the gym is too expensive and I don’t feel I would enjoy the atmosphere. Is working out at home an option that will keep me fit enough?"

AskReddit,fq9txs6,t1_fq9l1ot,1589206977.0,"Honestly the debt one is so important. I wish I had realized that sooner. I got an amazing job quite quickly after high school, made insane amounts for my age - but I spent 95% of it and had close to nothing left when I went to University. My parents took me back in when all the debt started crumbling down on me and gave me the opportunity to use rent money to start paying down debt. I was lucky to find another job that pays quite well, although it is much more physical labour and more time consuming. But that doesn’t bother me. All I want is to pay off everything I owe as quickly as I can. I will be debt free again in September. 

This whole deal made me understand how important it is to keep your money together. I made a budget plan for the first time in my life and I am sticking to it 100%. I can pay my debt, live a relatively decent life and even put aside 250-300 bucks a month. Thanks to my parents I was able to learn this valuable message without any major damage. But everyone who is my age, please don’t make the same mistake. Don’t spend endless amounts on fancy food and drinks for you and your friends. I had an amazing time spending it, but a really shitty time owing thousands of dollars to banks, the tax office (never forget about your taxes!!!) and others. I’d rather have had “just” a good time all the way through instead of going up and down.

Thanks for your comment!"

It depends on those circumstances that we don’t know!! You don’t know any of these people personally. All you have is a bunch of TMZ articles that don’t even accuse anyone of anything. You’re calling someone a pedophile based on assumptions that YOU are making. You don’t know Drake and you don’t know his motivation for being friends with Billie Eilish and this other girl. And while I can sorta see where you are coming from, I study law and my feeling as to when someone can be accused of an act this awful is more evidence-based.

You switched up to different ones - like my critique toward America was CLEARLY that people are dying because they can’t afford insulin. I never doubted that people are dying all over the world from lack of insulin. But Americans live in a country where there is enough insulin, but people can’t afford it. 

I’ve never been in such a useless discussion before. Good day"
MadeMeSmile,fp9fhc6,t1_fp9e23f,1588424759.0,"1. How about some sources? I haven’t found anything about people dying from not being able to afford insulin in Europe. 

2. It’s not me who is taking it as a fact, but a respectable percentage of Republicans are. Don’t twist my words. 

3. I never said homeless and poor people are not dying. Again, don’t twist my words. I said nobody who has diabetes will stay without insulin here. Even if you are homeless and dirt poor you will get insulin. I didn’t say we have no poverty lol. 

4. You literally said “Americans are awarded basic health. Emergency rooms cannot turn you away. Again, they CAN NOT”, so yeah. 
A more in-depth discussion about what is basic health is too much for this tho, I agree with you there. 

5. 
• America is not doing better on climate change than countries who are in the Paris treaty. But the US are way doing better now in regard to climate change than before, which is very cool. But it is an accomplishment of the people, not the government. 

• Yes there are medical breakthroughs... but a respectable portion of people can’t afford them! 

• Your economy is great for a large part. But and because there is no regulation to protect from the negative impact of capitalism. 

• So who in the world is America helping right now? America stepping in is not the world crying for help, it’s at least partly American egoism that makes them intervene, same as China and Russia 

• Why are you comparing America to UK? I never mentioned them? 

• America “donates” money the same way every country does - in a way that will make the money come back to the US. But every country is guilty of doing that 

6. 3 of 6 rebuttals was you twisting my words and not actual arguments. Still better quota than your president tho :) 

7. No like I said, I don’t claim to know the whooole place. I claim to know how your political and judiciary as well as parts of your education system work because that is part of what I study at University. Plus I am in touch with several people from various parts of the states. And most importantly I read the news, in various sources, American, non-American, you name it. Just stop twisting my words please because like this it’s really no fun to argue. 
(Also, are you basically saying you don’t know the place since you probably haven’t spent more than a year in every state?)

8. To be clear: I am not badmouthing the American people. You guys are awesome, really. It’s just your government that sucks - and of course that’s purely my opinion."
MadeMeSmile,fp9cbgh,t1_fp923ge,1588422101.0,"1. It’s not about complications related to diabetes. It’s about dying from lack of insulin due to financial problems. Name another first world countries where this happens and I’ll gladly take this back. 

2. Fair enough, your government didn’t call the US the freest country, I was mistaken on this. (But, Fox News, one of the most widely watched channels/programs, does) 

3. I am aware that people are aware about being ripped off. I never said I wasn’t. I just said that it saddens me, watching this from a country where anyone gets the medicine they need free of charge one way or another, and there are countries where things are even easier to access than in mine. 
I believe that you definitely have the right to be protected from death by poverty. That is literally one of the basic functions of a government, imo. Of course you also have to take responsibility for yourself, but sadly not everyone can. 

4. Emergency can’t turn you away? Honestly this is a perfect example of how your view seems twisted to me - is this really what passes as basic healthcare that you are being “awarded” - in return for a couple thousand bucks?? 

5. Honestly it’s not just the healthcare system - there are lots of other things where America just is not up to speed with other democratic countries. Which would be fine if at least you had a decent voting and political system that would invite people to participate. 
I’m not saying that every other country is better than you guys I’m just saying your country is sooo loud for what little they actually do for their people. 

6. Reminding about the - in my opinion - sub-par healthcare situation in the US is indeed a beneficial addition to this discussion imo. Because only once every person in the US has understood that they are entitled to more, and that they are being ripped off left and right, and only once many people are willing to attack this problem there can be change. I am not trying to sound like an angry European trying to make you feel like shit about your origin. I’m genuinely concerned for those in America who cannot protect themselves from political greed, corruption and lack of diabetes medication. And I‘ve spent some time in the US. It was only a year, but it’s not like I don’t know the place at all."

worldnews,foiqpl5,t1_foiptaq,1587793980.0,"I’m from Europe and while it’s not quite as bad here as you guys have it with Trump, you can tell he has some kind of influence too. And there are leaders that use very similar political/rhetorical methods as he does. We have Boris Johnson in the UK, Victor Orban in Hungary (who has just managed to give himself unlimited power by declaring an emergency state that only he, not the parliament, can end). And we have Andrzej Duda in Poland, who is infiltrating their courts, basically getting rid of division of power. 

So yeah, it’s not just you guys. Nationalism is back on the rise"

worldnews,foiq76f,t1_foiowmb,1587793535.0,"This cracked me up!! 

I once read that he would be richer now had he just handed the $1M his dad gave him to a trustee to invest the money, compared to how rich he got following his entrepreneurial instincts. It’s hilarious

edit: 3 people have informed me it was around $400M. That’s even sadder."
lilwayne,foiphel,t1_foi62bv,1587792923.0,thanks for the recap!!! is this rly gna happen every friday?
YoungThug,foex76d,t1_foelmn2,1587717954.0,I don’t think so but would be nice.. But music is changing soo fast like you can’t even compare that to the boomers‘ time. And 99% of the bands they liked are 100% irrelevant now and there is rarely any clear influence visible
AnimalRights,fo6cmiw,t1_fo6ayhz,1587554751.0,"Thanks for staying civil with me! :) I agree too, people should get more dogs from shelters. However many dogs are mentally damaged from the bad conditions in these shelters. So I think some of them are too much of a challenge for inexperienced people. They will get frustrated and bring the dog back to a shelter, which helps neither. I’ve seen this happen multiple times. So usually we refer experienced dog owners to shelters to make good use of their experience. 

And I know that many dogs are completely fine. But the majority does have issues, either due to the conditions at the shelter or the conditions they had at their last home. So for a beginner it may be tough, and actually dangerous in some cases, to get a dog from a shelter. This makes it all the more important for experienced people to help out dogs from shelters. 

Thanks a lot for this nice discussion. It’s a topic with a lot of factors to consider and sadly there is not enough science yet to solve these problems on a big scale. I am hoping that this will change in the near to immediate future and we will be able to gift many more dogs and other animals beautiful lives and give them the respect they deserve. Let’s all work toward that, in whatever way each of us can."
AnimalRights,fo69d4u,t1_fo6788j,1587551441.0,"Okay so on the risk of being completely bashed here I’ll out myself: my parents breed dogs. 

We have had dogs my entire 22 years of life (and longer). I have had several dogs to call my own and have always developed a great bond with them, I have always regarded them as siblings and equal partners. I am studying law now and planning to put my degree towards animals‘ rights, and I have already chosen a Master‘s degree in Barcelona specialized in this field. 

I am saying this to add credibility to my love towards animals. I would truly never hurt any animal in any shape or form. However there is too little science, sadly. So what I am about to say is based on my experience, impressions, and feelings. I would say tho that I am very good at reading dogs‘ body language. I have successfully managed to make dogs who showed strong signs of anxiety much more self confident. 

So here we go:

Yes, cows suffer from their babies being taken away. That is because the babies are taken away several HOURS after birth, which is fucking cruel. I live next to a farm (I’m in Switzerland, strictest animal laws in the world), and the mama cows sometimes cry for days after their babies were taken away. It’s one of the saddest things I have ever seen in real life. 

However it is imo not comparable to dogs. We don’t give the babies away after a few hours, but after 10 weeks. At this time their mum will often disregard them and not even want to play with them (depends on the mum as well ofc). The puppies however are starting to focus more on us humans after like 7-8 weeks. They follow us around, love to play with us and spend more time with us than with our adult dogs because they are not as interested.

After around 9 weeks you can tell that puppies have a looot of energy and they are willing to learn. This is why they need a human/ a family to focus on just one of them instead of 6 at the time. 

Adequate social skills are important, definitely. But I’ve received puppies from other kennels that had anxiety BECAUSE they were playing with their siblings and other dogs - and since they (the puppy) were the smallest and weakest they would always be undermined. 

Modern dogs and wolves are only somewhat comparable. We domesticated dogs around 6 thousand years ago. A lot has changed in them. Afaik modern dogs would likely leave their parents much much sooner. 

None of the puppies we have had have ever showed any signs of lacking social skills or other issues - we are in close contact with all of our buyers (who have to go through thorough screening before even receiving one!) and we have met all the dogs multiple times in their adult lives - and they are all fine, they are all beloved and they are all equal partners to these people. 

Also, if you buy a dog from us you HAVE to go to dog school. This should be a legal requirement imo, as it strengthens the dog‘s social skills AND trains the owner on how to read their dogs and make them feel happy. 

That said, I recognize that many many animals are suffering in shelters. And I in no way condone all the things that happen in dog kennels overall. Some of them work like a mafia. 

But it is definitely possible to breed healthy and happy dogs and make them and their new owners eternally happy. 

I’m sorry for the long text - I have so many thoughts on this because I have this debate with myself too. Please don’t bash me. I am very willing to answer more questions and/or reply to further comments and statements"
AnimalRights,fo5wi8u,t3_g5tomh,1587537995.0,I doubt there’s any evidence that puppies have any long term damage from being separated from their family - and tbh I doubt they even do
YungLean,fnx4sv8,t3_g49j5r,1587331480.0,Have Spotify? I made an introductory playlist for my bestie a few years back. Is not all the way up to date tho.
YoungThug,fnwyosk,t1_fnwp1dv,1587328058.0,I agree that album is something else. Barter 6 and BTG are my absolute favs
YoungThug,fnwylyx,t1_fnwu15c,1587328013.0,Yeah it reminds me of Weezy 2007/08. He should’ve made all the leaks official songs with proper editing and mastering. Same goes for Thug
FrankOcean,fns5k2m,t1_fns57sb,1587213312.0,"Well yes legally speaking it is the same kind of offense - BUT of course there are lots of differences as well. You won’t go to jail for touching someone innocently, especially if they are a public figure. 

I’m just saying that the reasons they are offenses are the same for both - invading someone’s physical integrity with no consent (have I said it often enough to summon some kind of demon?). But I’m not saying what these fans are doing = rape. I’m saying your early statement sounds like a predator TO ME, and the two acts we’re discussing have legal/philosophical common ground. That does not mean it’s the same. 

However I’m getting tired of this meaningless discussion as I am sure you are too. So have a good day"
FrankOcean,fns52p1,t1_fns3rrg,1587212892.0,"Because they both invade the other person’s physical integrity with no consent. So of course they are very different in their severity but from a legal point of view it is the same kind of invasion of personal rights.

edit: I still only said your earlier statement SOUNDED like something predators say."
