I mean the one sentence that says ...they'll know it was Charlie... looks like it was just pasted over other words to fit his agenda. Nothing about feldman can be taken seriously now. I'm afraid hes just another casualty of shitty people in his life when he was a child. Damn it sucks that we just inherit the trauma. I wish C. Feldman the best. 

I'm hoping that these predators will eventually die off Or children will be better able to tell a trusted adult because of awareness.  So soso many problems in our world could be prevented if children got the proper nurturing. I mean animals know how to do it better than humans do. Anyway so long for now"
DocuJunkies,fk8v50b,t1_fk8qslw,1583963498.0,"I've really enjoyed reading your posts. I didn't realize that was you that posted the video. Feldman shows classic Pdisorder behavior, manipulation etc. His early home life seemed very dysfunctional and we all know where that leads. It seems he would have done anything to stay close to fame and power because he just wasn't likeable or cute enough for Hollywood and was probably jealous of Haim. Sometimes you see Golden Child roles in Narcissistic families and grooming in paedophilia. Corey had a role to play and hes in total denial (or arrogance). As he was with Mj. It was all about the $$$$ but started with his own parents as he was immersed in a seedy adult world full of diet pills and hot tubs. 

I wasn't aware of the dialogue with J. Haim. I'll look into it"
