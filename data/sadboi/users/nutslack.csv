This made me cry pretty hard.

As a very tall, lanky, socially awkward kid at a new school, I was bullied out of every program I tried. I just was not coordinated at all. And was made fun of constantly.

In this video, it honestly sounds like they're chanting my name. I don't care if they're not. I am so happy my daughter will be a part of this new generation. I hope she is treated like this, because every kid needs to be encouraged to do things that are hard; things they couldn't do without the support of others.

Thank you for sharing this. It made my day."

Have you tried ECT? It's a temporary solution but it works if you keep the maintenence sessions up.

My psychiatrist has me trying ketamine. I feel as though I have finally found something that will help that isn't really addictive. Medical marijuana has also helped a lot. High cbd and a sativa heavy hybrid has given me energy and taken some of the edge off.

Last thing, I treat suicide like an option b. I always have it in the back of my mind. Some how that is comforting. There's always a way out.
