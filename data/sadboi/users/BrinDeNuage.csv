AnimalCrossing,fnot25x,t3_g32srz,1587133045.0,"I was looking for something very specific and the designs I found were not exactly what I wanted. I got inspired by that design but I was not a big fan of the sides ([https://twitter.com/nanase\_\_game/status/1245193740420956161?s=20](https://twitter.com/nanase__game/status/1245193740420956161?s=20)). 

How to use: just place dirt paths with the building tool. They have to be of different types so they don't connect. Darker dirt path makes darker soil since the design is transparent.

Second of all, I knew what it's like, I don't have issues with my weight but I had a lot of pimples back in high school and I had to wait until college to finally have guys interested in me. 

Though I can understand the argument that someone said earlier. That some people work on their body a lot and may not be interested in people that are less fit than them. However, it's not an excuse to be an asshole, AT ALL. 

I hope you'll find someone that can be interested in you as a person and that you'll find beautiful people, there are hard to find, especially in the gay community but there are some people.
