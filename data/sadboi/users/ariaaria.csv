NintendoSwitch,fqz19b3,t1_fqz05eb,1589758113.0,"PC has a platform called Steam where you have achievements that you can show to all your friends after doing certain tasks inside a game. To me, it was the social aspect of competing with friends that really drew me in. I liked being able to see that my friends were playing games and knowing what games they were. Even while they were offline, I could see their game progress. I liked knowing I got past a certain point in a game over them. These are 15+ friends I've known since high school so I guess competing with each other has always been our thing.

Other PC games such as Fortnite, Overwatch, Destiny 2 and Warzone have a level-up system where you get visual confetti once you've levelled up, giving you a false sense of progression. However, this progression never ends.

MMO games such as Elder Scrolls Online and Black Desert require such a high time investment that when you finally get there, you realize none of the other players on the server even care.

A lot of PC games nowadays don't really have an end to them and really focus more on the reward than the game in my opinion.

EDIT: I'm going to add that games such as Doom Eternal got it right in terms of balance between the time investment required and gameplay. It's an inherently fun game.

At least with switch games, the actual gameplay is fun. The gameplay is the actual reward.

On Elder Scrolls Online, I'm mashing numbers in a sub-par combat system just to see my player level increase by a value of 1."

Also fell out of my secondary job as a music producer because I'd just game all day and make excuses to clients as to why their soundtracks weren't finished.

The Switch is similar to a Nicorette patch where I can get smaller doses of gaming while still not getting that itch/aggression.

Like I said, just because it's cheap, I'm not that upset about it. But if they charged Xbox's rate then I'd be a bit more livid.

I do notice though on games where you can control the camera, the FPS drops dramatically. The battery consumption seems to be higher as well. Games with a fixed camera (ie. Pokemon or Animal Crossing) barely have FPS drops if ever and I can play them for like 5 hours straight on my Switch Lite vs 3-4 hours for non-fixed camera games."

I honestly like where BoTW went with the game but with the sequel coming out, I have a hunch it will go on sale one day to prep players for the new release. 

On top of that, I kinda prefer player versus player games with a live service style so Pokemon naturally appeals to me a bit more.

confessions,fppja0l,t3_gehfex,1588803308.0,"If it makes you feel any better, I've lived my entire life as a young person. I'm nearly in my 30's right now and it doesn't feel that way. I still feel 18. I had never planned on living this long either, because just like you, I have severe depression.

It's okay during the spring and fall but during the summer and winter, it gets really bad. Like, 'I can get violent' kinda bad. One thing you realise, though, is that you're going to die anyways. May as well live for as long as you can to see how it all turns out."
confessions,fppizsn,t3_georux,1588803154.0,"Just don't focus on the person; only where the country is going. America is bigger than one man or president. These people come and go every 4 years but America will last for hundreds of years.

Please don't take what he does personally. I'm a Canadian and I honestly couldn't care about what the president does. Only what the people are doing (and, in my opinion, protesting Covid-19 is one of the stupidest things you can ever do)."

Trust me, he could be putting on a show. 20 people is actually a lot of people -- imagine doing a play for 20 people in a room!"
InternetMysteries,fppcrx9,t3_geg0cb,1588799933.0,"I'd been stalked by a mentally ill person before.

They got bored after a while because I was very open with them. Made sure I left the curtains open while I slept. Literally put a note on where I was going next, etc. When you're open with them in this way, their suspicion of you goes down.

I can understand why the average person would feel uncomfortable being watched while sleeping, though."
