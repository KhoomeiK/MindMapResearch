Nexplanon,fq6j7if,t1_fq3ees3,1589132566.0,Your doctor can prescribe a birth control supplement to to usually control and/or stop the bleeding
Nexplanon,fps1y51,t3_gexzvb,1588866112.0,"I understand that most doctors say 3-6 mo (leaning towards 6mo) for an adjustment period, but if your symptoms are interfering w daily life and causing you distress, then I imagine a doctor could make an exception. It is important to remember (as I’m sure you already know) that not only is this a different birth control than your OG one, but you are pretty much a different person now! So your hormones and body interact with this birth control differently, and vice versa. 

In my opinion (of not being a doctor but a fellow nexplanon user), it sounds like some birth control pills would definitely be warranted for you, but it is important to remember that your body might adjust to a new normal after! 

Best of luck!"
Nexplanon,fpj1rsy,t1_fpihb8g,1588654211.0,"Oh for sure, that thought sounded a bit more intense. Just didn’t know if it was a random arbitrary thought or if your brain was like, “we’re angry bc of this so we’re gonna think of this drastic measure!” Either way, I think you’re making the right decision by speaking to your doc. Can’t hurt to reach out to your ob/gyn either! Overall I know a lot of doctors will tell their patients to wait at least 6mo but seeing that you’re close to that, I hope they’ll have a way of helping you!"
Nexplanon,fpigr4t,t3_gdnu49,1588640572.0,"I’ve experienced some more emotional moments that’s for sure, even when it’s regarding something that shouldn’t be super emotionally charged. Definitely a tendency to become angry muuuuch quicker than other emotions but it’s nothing I feel I can’t control (at least out in public). I feel like when I spot it takes foreveeerrrr to completely go away, but it’s really only a week or so of basic spotting. As far as the drowning thought you described, if you haven’t had those kind of thoughts before and it doesn’t feel like the “regular” ‘what would it be like to drive off this bridge?’ Weird intrusive thoughts, then I would let your general practitioner know because they can provide good coping mechanisms for those moments where emotions pop up out of nowhere"

HealthAnxiety,fon4s6v,t3_g8bu8o,1587912221.0,"I’ve had those symptoms but for a bit longer than you have (and am still okay!!), and I mean those EXACT symptoms. By now, I feel like I’ve put myself halfway through medical google school with all the googling I’ve done lol! 

But, when I was in the depths of my anxiety, I read something that helped me (and I hope it helps you too!): “ALS weakness is not difficulty in doing things, but the absolute inability to do things at all.”

It helped me realize it’s not “wow it’s hard to open this jar of peanut butter that everyone else is able to open easily” but more “wow i can’t even get a grip on this jar.”

My tip would be to try and find something that helps the months pass by easier. If that’s speaking to a doctor about getting on some medication (as I did and it’s changed my life), then so be it. If that’s taking a walk outside, then so be it. If it’s watching Netflix for a bit and taking a nap, so be it!

Finally, finishing off everything with a silver/ashy blonde to toner (and styling the hair!! Curls make everything better ☺️). 

Also, proper techniques as far as blending and understanding on how to manipulate product for every client and how that process varies greatly (ie always gonna approach a client differently)

Of course, I’m just speculating on the pictures and could be very wrong but that also just goes to show how every process is different because it should be customized to each individual client!"

Hair,f9qmin1,t3_e6hrh0,1575563613.0,"As the others have said, any lightening agent (aka “bleach”) will make your hair weaker than it is now. That being said (and also as others have said), there are products that can fill any bonds that have been damaged and become overly porous in the process of lightening your hair. I have used Olaplex #1 and can personally attest to it being a lifesaver when added to the lightening mixture. 

Some hair stylists will prefer to do the blonde process over several sessions, to be a bit more gentle on the hair. Be sure that this is something you can do!

And last but not least, I would recommend going to a consultation with your hairstylist before you get your hair colored, maybe even on a totally different day in general. Ask the hair stylist to walk you through the entire process and don’t be afraid to ask questions. Ask for a complete aftercare routine (as aftercare is how you’ll maintain your blonde until a touch up appointment). Also, I’d ask for portfolios if I was going blonde!

Overall, don’t be afraid to do your research. When you fall in love with your blonde hair color you’ll be thankful you did!"
AmItheAsshole,f9fb2n1,t3_e4pkid,1575264915.0,"YTA and missed the point. 

Just from reading the article, I think your friend was probably not upset about sex. She could prob give 2 shits about sex. What she *does* care about is that her husband refuses to be intimate with her, his wife and mother of his child, because he finds her unattractive enough. I doubt his lack of intimacy is limited to sex, and she is probably feeling it emotionally too.

You’re right in the point that someone can’t demand sex just because they’re married and want sex, no matter the reasoning. Consent is consent. This matter you’re describing though sounds like it has nothing to do with the topic of consent  and everything to do with her husband being insensitive and refusing to love his wife, and/or be honest with her before it got to the point that she had to ask him why he was feeling this way. 

He’s shallow and it sounds like you need to listed to your friend. I hope everyone is able to make amends with your friend and she receives the love and support she is asking for."
