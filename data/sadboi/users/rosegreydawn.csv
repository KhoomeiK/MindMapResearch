schizophrenia,evr9nci,t3_ckthan,1564703801.0,"I hear voices in French, German, Hebrew, Italian, and Spanish. I only speak English and Italian."
schizophrenia,evr92pr,t3_cko30r,1564703483.0,"I have schizoaffective, which is schizophrenia with a mood disorder -- major depression in my case. I also have PTSD and some OCD symptoms. Your difficulty handling negative emotions might be a symptom of a mood disorder, too, but I'm not a psychologist so take what I say with a grain of salt.

I have olfactory hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. I experience people as hating me and being very angry towards me and it is very isolating. I hear voices and, just like you, I hallucinate cats quite a lot.

I also went to therapists for years without ever having schizophrenia suggested as a diagnosis for me. I was pretty good at hiding symptoms because I was afraid of being committed. It took a few years of psychotic breaks to finally fully admit what I had known for a long time, which was that I have schizophrenia. I think it's really important to see a medical professional like a psychologist who can listen review your symptoms and diagnose and prescribe medications. Therapists are great for emotional support, but not always the best at diagnosing diseases like schizophrenia.

I'd encourage you to do a little research into what schizophrenia is and what the diagnostic criteria are. You need to meet a few of them to be diagnosed as schizophrenic. You might recognize some things that you didn't know where symptoms too. For me, that was catatonia. I had experienced it many times but never knew the word for it or that it was a symptom of schizophrenia.

So here's the thing about meds: illnesses like this aren't temporary. Depression can get better in some cases, but a serious illnesses like schizo are lifelong and progressive. That means if left untreated you are at serious risk for developing more serious symptoms, like cognitive dysfunction, confusion, memory loss, and ultimately dementia. I also thought that schizo could get better with time or therapy, and now I'm disabled by my cognitive problems and life is much, much harder than it used to be.

It may be hard for your family to accept, but if you have a disease you need medication to treat it. Medication can go a long way to ease suffering, and I regret that I spent so many years in agony. You sounds like you are really suffering, too, and you deserve to feel better. A twenty minute chat with a psychiatrist and a few new prescriptions changed my life radically and it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

I'm not saying it's easy or perfect, cause it isn't. But life with treatment is way better."

Schizophrenia is a progressive disease. You may have good periods if you stay off drugs, but the disease will get worse. Psychosis inflames the brain, and prolonged psychosis causes brain damage. You may not have found a medication that works for you yet, but with a more accurate diagnosis finding the right med will be easier. I really encourage you to pursue a diagnosis! I went sixteen years without mine, and I could have had a much better life had I been medicated earlier."

orchids,eux3qi6,t1_eusxl8l,1564082914.0,"It's really easy! The most important part is getting all the dead matter off the roots: moss, bark, and dirt.

If your orchid is the type to like dry periods, you can dump the water at regular intervals and let it dry for a day or so. My oncidium doesn't get dumped, she lives in water full time. You'll probably want to do the same with yours.

Definitely not an expert but I have seen a lot of amazing results with water culture so I'm quite a fan."
