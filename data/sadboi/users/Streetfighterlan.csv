Thanks! I never knew that. Do I have to rotate my sprites to face rightwards then? And Do I just have to rotate the bullet or do I have to rotate the bullet and character? Thanks!"

The problem is, the sine and cosine don't really make much sense to me and they don't really work either, as they go in weird directions instead of the direction I thought they would go. I know how to code it so that after they are fired, they stop using the character as their angle, but they don't go the right direction when fired...

I did try for a while with this code, but I still don't understand how to do it.."
