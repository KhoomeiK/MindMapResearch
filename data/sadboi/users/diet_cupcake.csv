eating_disorders,fntinlx,t3_g3temy,1587242423.0,"It's important to take care of yourself. I understand wanting to be a good friend and letting them talk to you about it but you have to take care of your own mental health first. I would calmly explain to them that you are feeling uncomfortable talking about the things they are telling you, as you are not in a great place to deal with that at the moment. Suggest reaching out to a therapist/counselor so they have someone to talk to. Though we as eating disorder sufferers have experience with the things your friend is going through and it is probably comforting for them to talk to you about it, it is not your burden to take on. You are not their therapist. Let them know you're there for them but cannot be there as much as they seem to want you to be. You can support and encourage your friend without them going into detail about what they're struggling with. 



I hope that is at least a little helpful. I'm sorry you're struggling with being triggered. It's such a difficult situation to be in."
EatingDisorders,fial59c,t3_f79d0r,1582303302.0,"Thank you for taking the time to ask these questions and research the correlation between identity and eating disorders!
I do have one suggestion. Many people with eating disorders do not identify as strictly either male or female. I would suggest adding at least non-binary and gender fluid to the options for that question."

It was a picture of their thin arm and they said something like ""is this what you want?!"" It was at an odd angle so it looked super long so someone commented ""expand arm"" and it just became a thing!"
