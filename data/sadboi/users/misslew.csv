This was quite similar to my experience in grad school and currently I‚Äôm getting my hours and have struggled through this in certain settings. I too found my traits useful in a crisis setting but in private practice felt that I had a hard time being ‚Äútherapisty‚Äù. Now, I am working with kids and find that my bubbliness and energy is well suited for it, but I‚Äôm still trying to find my strength areas that are a fit for me. I‚Äôve come to terms that I‚Äôm never going to be a stoic therapist."

You can sit back and relax and be pampered. So, I think it‚Äôs all about your preference. You can also maybe find someone to use your products you‚Äôre wanting as another option."

Last time I heard, YAZ is the only birth control that‚Äôs proven to treat PMDD and that‚Äôs usually what they prescribe. Another option I‚Äôve had a dr tell me is that they can take anti depressants the week of their period. Other than that, magnesium, exercise and other natural aids can help."
Enneagram,f0k6krd,t3_d4skm1,1568671600.0,"Be comfortable and do what you need to feel confident, make sure it‚Äôs in a comfortable environment, I liked to keep a few questions in my back pocket that I‚Äôd use if I needed it but hoped convo would just flow naturally, I also liked to have an ‚Äúout‚Äù plan haha, but just telling yourself to live in the moment and whatever happens happens used to help me. Sometimes doing a mindfulness app if you‚Äôre starting to over think helps with any overthinking but Not putting expectations on it helped me with overthinking!"

I too thought it was inauthentic, I used to say I felt it was ‚Äúfake‚Äù- like something you hide behind or presents oneself differently. Even now, into my late 20s I rarely wear makeup and When I do it‚Äôs very natural. I tend to like natural beauty and when I went to France this summer loved that the women there don‚Äôt wear makeup/it‚Äôs very natural if so. There‚Äôs just something about it for me it‚Äôs hard to describe."

Also, it sounds like you might treat others the way you want to be treated (love your neighbor as yourself) and  I think it can extend from there :)"
Bumble,f0b175n,t3_d41y04,1568521275.0,"Yes penpals was exactly the word I would use haha,  like what‚Äôs the point? However, I know not everyone is like me and everyone is different. Yes I‚Äôm a female and not currently on bumble b/c I met my boyfriend on there actually :) but when I was, I did read the bios and cared about the person beyond their pics"
Bumble,f0acbs1,t1_ezu7lhv,1568513065.0,"Agreed, I always felt this way too. I would hate to already talk about everything in message before meeting and then have nothing to talk about. Plus, it feels weird to me to talk to someone a lot over a period of time and never meet them- they still feel like a stranger to me that way idk."
Bumble,f0a9fvb,t3_d41y04,1568512134.0,"I felt the same way the first time I used the app. I think it differs for all people, but I would suggest just asking when you actually want to ask and can find out if they want to or not. I didn‚Äôt like talking for long periods of time to people and would rather meet in person and talk so I appreciated when guys would ask after we talked for a bit and it felt like we meshed well. If someone doesn‚Äôt want to they can say no and then your time won‚Äôt be wasted. As for people swiping right and not messaging, many possible reasons for that. Sometimes girls might not be keeping up on the app or might not be wanting to actually start talking yet, just getting used to the app etc. amongst others but probably frustrating for sure!"
ADHD,eye6krb,t3_cwn9og,1567029503.0,"I‚Äôve been there too. What stops me is learning from my past experiences of actually doing that and it doesn‚Äôt turn out well, so I go back to that and it helps me from choosing it again."

psychotherapy,epcrq3y,t3_bufswu,1559157683.0,"My journey was a bit of a different order than yours, but after grad it started with a horrible experience where I quit after 2 weeks which led me into a non profit management role. I did that for a few years, so I felt like I needed to expose myself to therapy to really make an informed decision. That‚Äôs what led me to the private practice. I really like it, but need something more steady like a 9-5 salary with benefits for my stage of life so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be looking into next if I decide to pursue the field further."
psychotherapy,epbz3rk,t3_bufswu,1559148450.0,Wow this is VERY similar to my path after graduation. I am working part time/ low hours at a practice right now after taking two months off to decide if I even wanted to pursue my MFT hours. I am still wondering the same thing- is the field for me?
