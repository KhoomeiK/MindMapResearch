If you are new to Gamewith, open these with Google Chrome and you should be able to automatically translate the entire page to somewhat broken, but understandable English. 

Near the top of the page you can select stages (11-15 for Original Garp Challenges) or Team Colors (for the 10☆ missions on doffy, revolutionary and whitebeard challenges)

The middle of the page usually has Gamewith's tested teams and describes stage breakdowns

Right at the bottom of the page are usually a ton of random people's teams and guides. Sometimes users link youtube videos on their posts which is even better"

Psy Katakuri boosts fighter, slasher, shooter and Driven character's attacks to lvl 6
