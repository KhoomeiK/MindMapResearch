walmart,flc0apo,t1_flbyumv,1585016793.0,Lol who’s that?
walmart,flbjcf3,t1_flbie0q,1585005827.0,So I guess it doesn’t really matter when I take my LOA then huh? Doubt they’ll be offering it 3-4 months from now anyway.
walmart,flbcfoq,t1_flbam7n,1585001804.0,I kinda figured we’d be quarantined (my Walmart) by the time I came back.
walmart,flb9igg,t1_flb8y7y,1585000116.0,Yeah lol he was trying to say I should feel safe because the national guard will be there and I told him I felt unsafe because it had to be there. Two ways of thinking about it I guess? I just feel like he was coming from a good place but he doesn’t know the first thing about what it means to show up at Walmart and work there. Easy for him to say when he doesn’t have any clue.
walmart,fl8upvv,t1_fl8r7s9,1584932788.0,I don’t blame them.
walmart,fl8fg7s,t3_fn9kf2,1584922458.0,"I have. I’m a department manager and I felt bad at first, but I work in chemical and paper. My toilet paper and Lysol/disinfectant wipes were the first to go. I saw the way people were hoarding first hand and I knew it was going to get worse. The last day I worked was the 11th. So my LOA was from the 12th-1st. I got so much shit from my coworker (DM over pets, who started the same time I did and we’re friends) she basically sent me this in a text:

“i have a feeling this is more bc you don’t wanna work. just wish you understood all the pressure you’re putting on me by doing this. you have like 10 pallets, 10 carts. i understand it’s scary but there’s 70 year olds still working and not taking advantage of the fact we don’t get pointed all month. just really sucks on me because everything is falling on me and it isn’t my fault. so bc your dept is busy you’re taking advantage of not being pointed and just not showing up? people are freaking out for no reason and you can’t control that so you’re just going to leave all the responsibility on me? i’m not hearing it. i work 3 aisles away from your dept and i’m not staying home bc people are yelling at me for not having toilet paper. people are sick every single day of their lives in this store but it’s fine i got all 3 depts.” 

My HR rep called me the second day I called in after I had filed for LOA with Sedgwick. She seemed nice enough about it but emphasized that the LOA cannot be taken intermittently which I understood and was fine with before she said anything. People will give you shit but play by the rules and you’ll be okay. We have the right to stay at home and I’ve been watching everyone’s posts in this subreddit and I knew it would get bad like it has-Walmart IS a breeding ground for chaos/violence and this virus. Better to just say fuck it I’m not gonna be a part of this shit."
walmart,fkuku2a,t3_fkqvm4,1584551262.0,Mine still says pending too. I started mine last Thursday. I was told it will say pending until you come back by another associate who’s taken many LOAs.
walmart,fkfx6y7,t1_fkfrts7,1584144674.0,I actually put in a leave of absence for self-isolation and my HR rep said “you know it has to be consecutive right” so you still have to put in for a leave of absence with Sedgwick and it has to be within 3 days of deciding to self isolate. It can’t be “hey I called in 2 days and then came back why aren’t my points taken off”
walmart,fkf1ofd,t1_fkc60ti,1584125226.0,UPDATE: HR manager called me and made sure I knew that the leave had to be consecutive no calling in one day and going in the next but I was approved by market mgr for my leave Walmart #truetotheirword
walmart,fkc4146,t1_fkc36wd,1584045363.0,Are you choosing to self-isolate or are you only calling in 1 day?
walmart,fkbwmad,t3_fhegd4,1584041285.0,"Well, I work in D4 and D13 as a DM. My toilet paper is gone, people are arguing over Lysol and disinfectant wipes. If anyone’s getting sick it’s us working at the most popular store in the United States and more specifically those of us working in the chemical/paper department. I am choosing to self-isolate, and I contacted Sedgwick and they say I need to call my HR Personnel at work so they can help me contact my claims supervisor. I’ve called and called and the HR supe isn’t there, co mgr answered and said to call back at 3 and I rung out (meaning no one answered me and I was automatically hung up on) I called off today and I’m at 3 points with like 5 hours of PTO/PPTO. This sucks yo"

walmart,f7o57p0,t3_dudkl6,1573921061.0,"At my store we are experiencing something called “ghost-scanning” where a customer walks up to a self-checkout and it will go on a frenzy scanning an item multiple times by itself even if the customer only has one item and only wanted to scan it once. I was working Friday on self-checkouts and there’s 10 of them in my section of the store. Every time it happened I shut a machine off. There were only 3/10 machines working, by the time I shut the ghost ones down. Management needs to do something about this. Customers are getting annoyed and frustrated with ME because we don’t have the self-checkouts working. I’m taking the brunt of the anger at the busiest time of the year. And this has been happening at least for a month."
