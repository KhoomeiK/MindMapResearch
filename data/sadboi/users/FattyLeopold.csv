We were advised to only crash in certain fields as some crop are expensive compared to others and can be really damaging to the aircraft.

For example: 

Wheat is light and fluffy, the least damaging but a very valuable crop to farmers. Don't crash here.

Soy isn't as valuable, is slightly more dense and damaging but doesnt grow as high. The ideal crash lander.

Lastly, Corn grows tall and heavy. Will likely fuck up the leading edge of your aerofoil and damage the rest of your aircraft. Dont crash here.

Edit: We also had police tell us to keep an eye out for any illegal grow ops while up in the air. Little patches of irregular coloured crop in the middle of a field. Never saw any, but would never narc either."
