Its standing water mixed with nutrients in a reservoir(in this case the hefty bucket) and you gradually lower the water level as your roots grow. the roots will make oxygen roots so don't drown those.

for a while, I used twine in the rockwool to get water to the roots but I DONT RECOMMEND this.

one, mold/bacteria. two, the roots were not growing as I'd have liked them to. maybe because they were spoiled by the twine supplying them water."

I'd say that if you are feeling extremely uncomfortable try doing a version that better suits you until you build the muscle - like the table I suggested earlier. if you are feeling shooting/serious pain it's definitely not good.

if you can, please grab a larger mirror and watch yourself. compare you vs the guy you're watching and make sure your body is ligning up correctly."

do negatives 3x sets a day! negatives really worked out for me. only took a week for me to get my count up by 10. really focus on your nutritional intake in this time. as for reps, don't do more than 8 at a time. if it's too easy, you're moving too fast. do the negatives SLOWLY.
