GifRecipes,forl25t,t3_g92b70,1588014029.0,"I would eat this if it was served to me but it's honestly not something I would make for myself, at least not without some tweaks.

First, the marinade could use a touch more. Soy sauce is amazing as a base to build on. I would have put the garlic and ginger in the marinade. Green onion would be a nice addition along with a little sesame oil.

When making sauces with soy sauce I like to balance it with sweetness. Ideally I use honey but brown sugar is also good or even white sugar if that's all you have. Some Korean marinades call for apples or pears to lend their sweetness. Oddly enough ketchup can even be used. Dried basil as well. So there's plenty of options there.

If you wanna go a step further, a little apple cider vinegar or rice wine vinegar would be a nice addition. Lastly I would touch it up with some white pepper, although black pepper is also ok.

If you like spicy foods you can throw in crushed red pepper or just some hot sauce like sriracha. I've been really into Frank's RedHot honey and garlic lately which works great with Asian foods. Tbh I've even used spicy brown mustard before, just be mindful of the vinegar.

These are some really basic ideas utilizing stuff you probably already have in your kitchen. But even so it's still super customizable.

My other major issue here is that chicken skin. I won't speak for everyone but I definitely do not like squishy chicken skin. The texture (and appearance) is so unappealing and unappetizing to me, personally. It's an easy fix though. We have two options: sear the chicken in a pan before baking or broil after baking.

My favorite is the sear and bake. You wanna use a heavy bottomed skillet on med-hi heat and sear each piece of chicken for a few minutes on each side until nice and brown. Then pop it in the oven, skin side up to cook completely and to further crisp the skin.

Now admittedly I was pretty intimidated of trying to sear meat for a while. Idk why because it's really easy once you understand the process. But if you want something even easier, simply bake your chicken as per instructed in the gif but once it's fully cooked, crank the oven up to broil, move the pan onto the top rack close to the heat and let it crisp for just a few minutes. With this method the underside won't be as nice but it's the price we pay for convenience I guess lol.

And for my last suggestion, I would double the marinade. Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pan, leaving the excess drippings, stir in a cornstarch slurry and let it bake for a little to thicken. Then spoon it over the chicken to serve. Can also be served over those steamed veggies or some rice."

She was also able to direct me to a few other low-cost/free places I had no idea about. I even found out about this business that legitimately waves any hospital fees you have if you bring in your bill and a few paystubs to prove you can't afford it (provided you do this *before* the bill is sent to collections).

EatCheapAndHealthy,fjfavmu,t3_fd2fd5,1583287973.0,"You should look into slow cooker or one pot meals. Totally saved my life.

Wake up, throw some chicken breasts and salsa in the slow cooker and 4-6 hours later you have a simple meal you can wrap in a tortilla, serve over rice, or eat with tortilla chips. And you can add anything you like to it. Beans, corn, onion, peppers, cheese, olives, etc.

The best part is, these kinds of meals are usually for an entire family (usually 4 servings) so if you're just feeding yourself you'll have leftovers for a couple days. I have depression as well and left overs are my best friend lol

Another one I really like is one pot baked chicken and rice. Extremely versatile and easy.

You can easily find a recipe online but the gist is to cook chopped chicken in a large pot, add rice and water, and bake. Too exhausted to cut up and cook chicken? Use those cans of chicken for chicken salad or pre-cooked frozen sliced chicken. Or any other protein for that matter. Sausage, beef, shrimp, etc.

And you can add just about any veggie to this as well. I buy bags of frozen mixed veggies and toss them in.

For healthy, easy snacks I've been buying sausage sticks, cheese sticks, and pretzels all in bulk. Take a look at the serving sizes on the packaging and divvy up individual portions in sandwich bags.

Oh and also you can freeze pb+js 😋 I make different varieties using bananas, chocolate syrup, honey, and thinly sliced apples.

1. Seeing what the food looks like on the inside at the end of the gif is one of the best parts. Honestly this pork chop smothered in black sauce looks unappealing which does not make me interested in trying this recipe. But maybe if it was cut open to show a nice juicy inside it would look a little better.

2. Plating is important. It seems like you enjoy the plating aspect of your gifs but it does need some work. In my personal opinion, I don't like garnishes that I can't eat. I suppose you *could* eat those tomato slices with the pork chop but it certainly doesn't pair well in my imagination. I would have served the pork chop on a bed of fluffy white rice, next to some colorful veggies that pair well with the Asian inspired sauce (think broccoli, carrots, peppers, cabbage), and then topped it with bits of green onion. It would not only look more appetizing but give the viewer a better, more realistic idea of utilizing this recipe.

This is just my opinion as a gif recipe fan and untrained 20-something y/o home cook so take it with a grain of salt"

BPD,fgjo3sj,t3_eyr33x,1580848023.0,"I recently started going to the gym daily and exercising has really helped. I'm not going to preach the whole ""all you need is to go outside"" kind of thing but exercising every day at the gym for at least 30 mins has kick started a new segment of my life. One that *will* be better.

I enjoy waking up early and getting that early morning sunlight and hearing the birds chirp and having the house silent and to myself but I've never been motivated to do it. Now I go to the gym at 8am so I'm up at 7 to have breakfast and enjoy the early morning.

This also gives me more daylight hours to enjoy my time. I have a few hours between the gym and work and so I've alloted that time for chores.

I have a real problem with not doing chores because I feel like I don't have enough time in my day to do what I want. But now that I do them in the morning before work I have the rest of the evening after work to enjoy leisure activities.

Naturally exercising means almost nothing without proper diet alongside it so I've been eating better too. And since I get all sweaty while working out I come home and take a long, thorough shower every day, something I've never done in my whole 24 years of living. And showering every day makes me want to brush my teeth every day too, something else I've never done.

All of these things combined have made me feel better physically and mentally. I've noticed I have a more positive outlook for my days now. I feel happier with myself and in general.

One of my big problems is that I'm usually so upset and angry most of the time that I don't even recognize it anymore. Sometimes I'll be mad and will be talking poorly to my bf but won't be aware of it because I'm so miserable in general that I can't register the behavior as different or wrong. But now that I've been generally happier it's been easier to recognize when I'm being a bitch.

I have officially realized just how toxic I become to myself and everyone else around me during a depressive episode and I refuse to give in to it anymore.

I *will* lose weight.

I *will* take better care of myself.

I *will* be happier.

I *will* be a better person."

""Look at his actions,"" you say.

Ok, bet. I'll look at the times he's thrown something out of anger. The times he's thrown something *at* me, but then later absolutely refused to admit he had thrown it at me and has no clue why I have a bruise. And then the times he's thrown something at the wall and then forced me to clean it up. One instance comes to mind specifically: The time he threw a giant glass candle holder and stood over me, screaming insults and telling me to hurry the fuck up, while I sat on my knees and hand picked all of the shards of glass up without my glasses (I'm near and far sighted).

But so many other complicated things go on. He's actually very kind when he wants to be. But when he's angry he'll hurl every awful insult he can at me. Some days he makes me feel like I'm on top of the world. Then  other times he'll give me the silent treatment and ignore me for days because his lunch was unsatisfactory.
