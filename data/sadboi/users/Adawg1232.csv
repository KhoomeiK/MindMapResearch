I was at about 35-45gpd and my first dose reduction was of about 5g and it was such a fucking emotional rollercoaster, I eventually ended up just subconsciously taking more and more doses a day and I actually ended up dosing 60-80gpd by the end of the ordeal lol.  I quickly cut back down to my original dosing regime before I would be stuck dosing like that which was absolutely unsustainable.  Even that reduction was absolute hell and I was dosing more on the upper side of the 35-45gpd range.  I tried cold turkey and that was hardly an option, and I ultimately found that long lasting opioids were the best thing.  I almost succeeded with a lope taper at one point and got down from 80mg of lope with 60-80mg of Omeprazole to about 40-50mg of lope, but then got back on kratom cause I felt it wasn't worth the potentially extreme cardiac effects.  I used suboxone instead and successfully tapered off of 8mg over the course of a few months with extreme relative ease.  To each their own.  I'm glad kratom actually worked for you!  Congrats.

Not telling you that it can't work on it's own.  Clonidine is a hit and miss.  Some people seem to genuinely benefit and some people either feel nothing or just get a headache.  Personally, I was extremely sensitive to it's psychological effects and just 0.025mg has a significant effect on me sober.  About lope, what I meant is that 16mg of lope will just about cut your diarrhea and maybe help with some stuffy nose.  I don't think it's worth upping the dose to get more opioid like effects however.  I won't lie, I personally dosed 20mg, and I had literally zero shits and stomach cramps even if I was in the same pain physically and psychologically.  That's just opioid substitution therapy with a very dangerous opioid and considering all the other shit you have on hand, it doesn't sound like that's at all what you want to do.  It's 75-100 times more powerful than morphine.  No, I did not quite get to a dose of 80-105mg of oxy at a time(which is approximately equivalent to 120-160mg of morphine).  I usually dosed about 60mg max of oxy and abused up to about 200mg a day, although there was a period I used 250mg.  Glad I wasn't able to afford a bigger habit.  Trust me, if you want to actually use lope and not overdo the shit out of it, 16mg will most likely be enough.  If you're still shitting your guts out, then use a little more.  All I'm saying is don't go up to something like 30-100mg and throw in some black pepper or Omeprazole to potentiate it so that you're basically on something worse than methadone.  There is no point whatsoever in doing that if your just detoxing with the help of some meds.  That's just switching out one high for a much much worse one.  Good luck.  I believe in you.

There really is no real reason regardless to go above 16mg cause that will quell physical withdrawals for pretty much anyone without causing much psychological effect which will only delay the inevitable hell you will experience.

Tbh, the only way I can imagine dxm being useful is that you use a dose high enough to dissociate, but not high enough to cause any uncomfortable stimulant effects, cause then you're asking for an anxious dissociated mess of a withdrawal experience, unless you already have a solid snri tolerance.  Literally any other dissociative would be better.  I know for a period of time I used nitrous oxide (with B12) to quell withdrawals and it worked miracles, and I know other people who used ketamine and one person who used MXE.  I actually remember I had a dxm trip and went into withdrawal at some point during the trip, and that was a hell I don't plan to replicate ever again.  At least please go slow when dosing.  Really slow.  Before opioids, I used to love dxm for it's wonderful calm euphoria and mystical dissociation, but now, it's the scariest drug I will never touch every again.  Good luck.  Be safe.

Also just wanna mention that that study uses dxm in conjunction with clonidine which is a very difficult experience from dxm alone as clonidine will reduce most of the norepinephrine response of withdrawals that dxm would otherwise amplify.  Ig just use dxm with clonidine."
Nootropics,fqzdxzy,t1_fqwe4s7,1589765350.0,"Lol you seem to agree with basically nothing I said but let me just clarify what I was getting at.  I'm very well aware tianeptine is an opioid but it's also considered a serotonin reuptake enhancer, reducing the concentration of serotonin throughout the brain. Although it seems to be uncertain how important this action is, tianeptine technically should increase the dopamine release from other opioids and other drugs most likely because it indirectly blocks the 5ht2c receptor.  But is it possible you simply didn't feel as high from other opioids while on tianeptine because you originally abused them without any opioid tolerance?  This would mean that similar doses of all opioids simply have less effect.  Ik that when I was addicted to kratom, I took 30mg of hydro at one point and literally felt nothing but some mild sedation, an unpleasant fatigue, and difficulty breathing that didn't let me dose much higher.

Now on the topic of kratom which I think is extremely important in this sub because a lot of people hope to use it to power through withdrawals, it can definitely cause withdrawals identical to other opioids but heavily variant in intensity.  The majority of information about it on the internet is sparse and massively biased towards kratom being viewed as a miracle drug incapable of causing harm.  For example, if you go onto r/kratom, you aren't even allowed to compare kratom to any other opioid (which is laughable considering that is exactly what it is) and if you mention that withdrawals were anything like withdrawals from any other class of illegal drugs, you get banned and your comments get censored.  A lot of sites are like this about kratom and it's a problem because most of those sites put out information that couldn't be farther from the truth.  Even the wikipedia page on 7-hydroxymitragynine that used to have concrete information about the opioid's strength being 17 times that of morphine (this number does range.  eg another study said 13 times), about it being most likely responsible for the addictive properties of kratom and that mice developed a conditioned place preference to 7-oh-mitragynine was all censored, leaving the wikipedia page basically empty, which is bullshit and most likely for no reason other than some manic kratom advocate thought that by deleting that information backed heavily by studies, they would make the world a better place.  The fact of the matter is that some 50% of regular users get moderate or severe opioid withdrawal like symptoms and 80% of regular users fail to quit their first time trying, and considering that most people using kratom aren't really abusing it, using maybe 3-8g everyday or every other day, that's pretty significant.  I wish I could find the particular article that mentioned this, but I can't atm.  However, there is generally plenty more scientific evidence to indicate that kratom can cause just as severe a dependence as any other opioid than there is to indicate that it's any better, especially considering the alkaloid 7-oh-mitragynine which is present in the plant on it's own and is also a metabolite of mitragynine, meaning that if you're a heavy metabolizer of mitragynine, much like with something like codeine or tramadol, you can get a pretty high from it and a pretty severe addiction.  Some people quitting tramadol pretty much are quitting an snri and others experience a full blown psychosis while quitting.  On top of that, individual plants and strains even contain these particular alkaloids in very random quantities.  Kratom also acts as a stimulant, antipsychotic, antidepressant, and sedative and all of these additional properties only serve to alter the quality of the high and make the withdrawals more unpredictable, although from what I hear people generally believe kratom's much more pleasurable than other opioids.  If you check r/quittingkratom, you'll find a whole lot of people saying that it wasn't that bad, and a whole lot of people saying it's the worst thing they ever experienced, and in fact most of the people I've seen there who used to abuse opioids and then got on kratom later said kratom withdrawals were worse.  I'm definitely in that group.

On top of this, I was also using a lot more kratom than you were and it sounds like you weren't really abusing it.  I used about 35-45gpd.  Before that, I abused about either 150-200mg of oxy, usually 200-250mg of hydro, frankly an unknown quantity of heroin, or 100-200mg of lope with 60mg of Omeprazole a day, sometimes using different opioids in the same day.  Regardless of numbers, it's really hard to tell if someone's kratom usage is actually more than another person's.  I have had kratom strains that barely quelled withdrawals at doses of 10g, and I've had strains that only required 6-8g, which was my usual dosage, spread over 4-6 doses.  However, when I got on 8mg of suboxone and started tapering off it relatively quickly, it was clear that I just got the shitty side of kratom withdrawals.  I even distinctly remember trying to get my kratom tested with the help of a UC graduate friend of mine who helped me get it sent to a lab to get tested out, and it didn't have shit like heroin or desmetramadol.  

Ultimately, what I learned from my harrowing experience with kratom and opioids is that if you don't get severe withdrawals or claim not to, you most likely either...
used very little and you didn't really abuse it so it's more or less impossible to compare your experience to actual opioid withdrawals...
you poorly metabolize mitragynine into the far more addictive alkaloid, 7-oh-mitragynine, so you get stimulant, antidepressant, etc benefits without much potential for addiction...
You simply react with less addictive behaviors to kratom because you feel less perceived euphoria from the kratom you use than other people using the same kratom...
you used very low quality kratom that either caused spins at low doses, didn't have many alkaloids in the first place, or was poorly cultivated...
or you're simply lying for one of three reasons: you feel that being an advocate, you must combat the experience of any person that thinks kratom caused a severe dependence, you have monetary incentive for kratom to stay legal because you're a vendor so you are scared of people potentially learning about the very real negatives of kratom, or you're an addict who is either in denial about withdrawals or is aware that if kratom becomes illegal due to people learning about kratom dependence, you will have to experience withdrawals.

I think kratom should stay legal.  It should be an easily accessible option to anyone addicted to far more dangerous or mentally and physically impairing opioids.  But while it stays legal, I hope that there will be more honest discussions about the really bad negatives of kratom even beyond addiction, because like any other drug, it's not perfect, and all that euphoria that kratom can provide doesn't come for free at all.

As for tianeptine, it's a miracle it's still legal right now.  I think people on tianeptine should try to get on kratom and see if it really helps, but I think people should be wary and not expect too much, like that it's gonna quell all withdrawal symptoms and then actually help you get sober.

Tl;dr: tianeptine does increase dopamine release by reducing serotonin concentration throughout the brain because it is a serotonin reuptake enhancer.  The reason you didn't feel as high from other opioids while using tianeptine is most likely either because you didn't have a tolerance to opioids when you first tried H and oxy or because over time the net serotonin in your brain actually increased and the dopamine release of other opioids was reduced (the latter is much less likely).  Kratom is as addictive as any other opioid if abused in the same fashion and there are many many factors that will go into whether or not you actually get addicted.  Don't buy into the bullshit about it online because it's an opioid among other things and not a perfect drug.  If you are addicted to more dangerous opioids, it's worth getting on it instead, but don't expect it to make the process of actually getting sober any easier

QuittingTianeptine,fqytiez,t3_gkntji,1589754300.0,"Out of everything you listed there, all that you may really need is clonidine, pregablin, vitamins, electrolytes and minerals (compensate for diarrhea and vomiting) maybe benzos, maybe kava, and low doses of lope.  

Dxm is horrible for withdrawals from any opioid because of it's potent stimulant snri effects that can greatly worsen anxiety, sweats, bowel problems, nausea, and depressive symptoms, and it's powerful nmda antagonism during withdrawals can either worsen anxiety, or help it, but most likely just lead to a lot of depersonalization and derealization and/or full blown psychosis (ime).  

Kratom is great as a maintenance/relapse drug for opioid dependence cause there is no real potential to overdose and it's usually considered a lot more functional and stimulating, but it can cause more or less the same dependence as other opioids.  It's worth a shot because some people do feel the withdrawals they get from it are less severe, but beware that just as many seem to find the withdrawals the same or worse.  Something like 50% of regular kratom get moderate to severe opioid withdrawals, and as you know a lot of regular users of kratom aren't necessarily abusing it and taking more than a few grams a day, and 80 of regular users fail to quit kratom on their first try.  I wish I could provide the paper I found this info on but I can't find it atm.  In essence however, be careful.

If you're gonna use lope, don't go above 16mg and only use it to quell certain physical symptoms.  Loperamide is an extremely powerful opioid, but it's peripherally restricted so you need really high doses or the addition of something that increases it's absorption (eg Omeprazole, cimetidine) if you want it to have a psychological effect.  However, at doses that provide psychological effects, there is a very significant cardiac effect from lope and it really is not worth the risk.

If you use benzos, don't go too hard.  It's an addiction you really don't want to substitute opioid addiction for.

Kava on it's own ime doesn't work great for withdrawals, but when paired with mucuna pruriens, I found it to work wonders for opioid withdrawals.

I hope this helps."
QuittingTianeptine,fqxucwz,t3_gkha41,1589737993.0,"I just wanna mention that kratom can really get you just as dependent as other opioids if you use it as you would another opioid.  Please hear me out.  I think it's a great maintenance medication before getting real treatment because it's safe in overdose and because people are generally more functional on it than with other opioids, depending on the kratom used.  But just as there are people who find that it can make getting sober easier, there are people who ultimately get more severe withdrawals from it.  These people aren't far and wide either.  They're becoming more and more vocal and heard as the kratom hype begins to die down and as people begin to adopt a more and more.  I used to abuse oxycodone, hydrocodone, occasionally heroin, and loperamide with Omeprazole whenever I had none of those among other types of drugs (stimulants for several years, cannabis for a year, nicotine for a few months, technically ssris for 5 years, and benzos for a just bcouple months).  After using for just over a year, I eventually got sober by quitting cold turkey, but after six months of sobriety, relapsed, and I heard of kratom about a week into using hydrocodone.  I naively believed, that if I used kratom, I could get the same opioid effects but without any of the dependence.  Back in those days, people on the internet much more frequently compared quitting kratom to things like coffee or antidepressants, and people were quick to shut anyone up who dared compare kratom to any other opiate.  Well I was right about one thing... If I took just a 2.5g dose, I was in heaven.  It felt better than hydro.  I really felt invincible and a euphoric sedation paired with stimulation that truly resembled a oxy/amp speedball more than anything, with a little more oxy than amp.  It was a red vein Bali kratom that I bought from a smoke shop.  I would soon learn that it wasn't the best kratom strain out there.  I set out to look for the strongest strain out there on the internet and in that nearby smoke shop, and with some cursory research and testing I found this very alkaloid rich green Malay kratom that was about 2-3 times as potent as the first kratom I bought.  The thing with kratom is that whether or not you'll get hooked on it will depend on the very plant you use and it's alkaloid content as well as your own body.  I continued to use it for some time between a year and a year and a half with some quitting attempts and horrible failed taper attempts, and when I ultimately tried to quit CT.  That was a hell that outdid any other opioid, or frankly, drug withdrawal I ever experienced in my life.  It was a torture I truly wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.  It felt like opioid withdrawals but with many aspects of stimulant withdrawals as well as even some aspects I only recognized when quitting benzos (manic cravings, waves of terror and panic, mania).  I got back on kratom after a week and ramped my dose back up for a month, until I got on suboxone.  I stayed on it for a while at 8mg, and tapered with relative ease.  Even tapering off kratom with much smaller dose reductions was a hellish seasaw of emotions I couldn't endure.

The only reason I write this is so that people don't look to kratom as a solution.  Some people will get on kratom and say that it's absolutely miraculous how they have no withdrawals, sometimes saying they almost feel better than they did while on the opioid.  The only reason for this is that it's an opioid with stimulant, antidepressant, antipsychotic, and mild alpha2 adrenergic and calcium channel blocking sedative and hypotensive effects.  All those other properties can further serve to alter the intensity and nature of withdrawals.  It contains the alkaloid 7-oh-mitragynine which is 17 times more potent and addictive than morphine, and mitragynine, which while on it's own is not addictive, gets metabolized into 7-oh-mitragynine at rates that vary from person to person.  Some people will refer to the fact that there are also alkaloids that behave as opioid receptor antagonists, but they're very very weak and generally in very small quantities throughout the plant unless there is a special strain known to have little to no opioid effect at all.  If you want to actually get rid of the dependence, there are far better non-opioid options as well as, imho, opioid options.  If you can find something like gabapentin, clonidine, cannabis, or any number of things, they can really help get sober quickly.  

Either way, congrats on getting where you are!  It really is no easy task with the quantity of tianeptine you were on.  I wish everyone here the best of luck getting clean off that shit."
QuittingTianeptine,fqwe0y2,t3_gih5q4,1589701096.0,"Hell yeah.  Suboxone is a life-saver.  I hate how many people will use it at excessively high doses, quit cold turkey, then complain that it's the worst drug ever for withdrawals.  Its not too difficult to do a little research into what Suboxone dose would actually help you.  You usually won't need 16mg which is equivalent to something like a single 250mg dose of oxycodone, and if you do get on 16mg, you need to reduce quickly to a dose that is appropriate, which it sounds like you did.  A lot of people using 90mg of oxy a day, jump on 16mg+ for years, and then quit cold turkey, clueless of the fact that they are asking for more intense withdrawals that last much much longer.  Tapering off of it however leaves you with objectively less intense withdrawals each dosage drop (and not by a little) even if they do last longer, and it really makes life easier.  Each dosage drop feels more like stopping an ssri and/or a small amount of nic than quitting whatever opioid you were on originally.  Fr.  Congrats, and fuck tianeptine."
Nootropics,fqwda1m,t1_fqv6vcx,1589700351.0,"Yup, fuck tianeptine.  It's serotonin reuptake enhancing effects only serve to enhance the dopamine releasing effects of opioids, amphetamines, nicotine, etc and hence their addictive potential.  

Kratom can lead to a hell of an addiction if abused as you would any other opioid too, but it's got the reputation of a medicinal plant that one simply cannot abuse and frequently people won't get to the point they abuse it daily, and once you do get dependent, it's withdrawals can range from mild, hardly opiate like wd, to wd damn near worse than other opioids.  How bad symptoms will be depends on your metabolism of a certain alkaloids in kratom and the quantity of alkaloids in the specific plants you've used.  I have experienced wd from heavy oxy/hydro abuse for a bit over year (I also used heroin and loperamide w/ Omeprazole and quit off lope once too.  After kratom, I experienced wd from suboxone during a taper.  I also have abused stimulants (Ritalin and amp) for years, nicotine for several months, cannabis for a year, and benzos for a brief period) and wd from kratom after almost a year and a half with a 6 month sober period from opioids between traditional opioid and kratom usage.  I can safely say that kratom withdrawals were personally worse than the other opioid withdrawals (including suboxone) with aspects of the wd ressembling both opioid and stimulant wd and even with some aspects of benzo wd (mania, intense cravings, terror and panic).  I tired both tapering and cold turkey, and no matter how slowly I lowered my dose, the constant seasaw of emotions was unbearable after a while.

A good general rule of thumb is that all opioids can ruin your life and get you addicted and dependent to them, no matter how invincible you may feel you are to addiction.  There is simply no telling whether or not you will get hooked, even if you feel you're in a good place in life or mentally strong.  Same goes for powerful stimulants, recreational gabaergics, phenibut, ghb and maybe even other classes of recreational drugs (eg cannabis, synthetic cannabinoids and dissociatives have subjectively ruined some people's lives).  

You may think you are clear headed and can do anything on these drugs and that they really do improve your performance, especially with opioids and stimulants (including kratom, tianeptine), but it's more likely than not that you aren't as clear headed as you may be lead to believe, considering your perception may not be altered very much on these drugs, and you may be set down a very scary path that simply isn't worth remotely touching.  

Also, nicotine is horrible as a nootropic.  You clan get just as much of a benefit from phenylpiracetam but without an incredibly unpleasant and very real dependence. Anyone here who had a nicotine addiction would probably agree that the notion of using nicotine for any real long term benefit past a few weeks of usage is ridiculous.  It's not even worth trying to cycle it."
Nootropics,fqryi8s,t3_gke8yl,1589594614.0,"With Lions mane, there is very little risk with taking it very regularly or taking too much.  I guess it's better to say you don't necessarily need to cycle because it won't result in any real benefit.  However, racetams, cholinergics, monoaminergics, gabaergics, opioidergics (if you really consider kratom or tianeptine nootropics), etc generally require that you don't take them regularly since your body and brain create certain adaptations that can result in reduced positive effects from the nootropic or even rebound effects or withdrawals.  For example, phenylpiracetam has multiple actions in the brain that generally very quickly result in anxiolytic (or anxiogenic), neuroleptic, and focus and memory enhancing effects.  However if you use it very frequently, it will have much less of a positive nootropic effect and while coming off the drug, you will have some haziness, sleepiness, and maybe even mild anxiety in rare cases.  A very extreme example is with opioids and stimulants, which when used consistently and without much of a period between the end of the drug's effect and the next dose, and especially if you slowly ramp up the dose, can result in highly unpleasant withdrawal syndromes and a dependence.  Because of this, it's best that with these drugs you take extended breaks every once in a while or use them infrequently and only when they are really needed."
quittingkratom,fqrx225,t1_fqogfh0,1589593726.0,"Kava is a lot less euphoric and stimulating than kratom, but is fairly relaxing and calming.  It generally causes fairly mild impairment at low doses along with some drowsiness while at high doses it can cause more impairment, usually more physically, as well as euphoria, mild visual disturbances (brighter lights and fuzziness) and intense sleepiness.  There are kava strains that can vary in the level of euphoria, anxiety relief, sleepiness, and even focus they can produce.  Kava also comes with very little to no potential for dependence and addiction.  Kava really does work best consumed the way it is produced traditionally in a sort of kavalactone (the active ingredients) suspension in water made from the root, but it can also be taken in extract capsules which frankly work alright.  There are some extracts you can theoretically smoke but it's questionable how effective it is as a method of ingestion.  If any water is present in such a preparation as it's smoked, the kavalactones will get destroyed and they require very high temperatures to be vaporized.  Kava requires usually a few doses before you can really feel any effect from it due to reverse tolerance.  It really doesn't compare to kratom and it's in its own class entirely imo, but it's pretty great regardless."
quittingkratom,fqr1mzx,t1_fqpp8n0,1589575920.0,"Yeah I wasn't completely fair.  Suboxone is no easy drug to quit and there is plenty of room for it's abuse, even for heavy heroin or other heavy opioid users which is a common misconception.  Since 16-24mg of buprenorphine is considered the maximum effective dose and is considered anywhere from 30-75 times as potent as morphine depending on route of adminstration (30 is sublingual, intrabuccal use has a higher bioavailability and is roughly 45 times as potent, and routes of adminstration with 100% bioavailability give buprenorphine a strength of about 75 times as strong as morphine).  Considering heroin's short duration for most people, an equivalent amount of heroin abused is about up to a gram a day.  That's equivalent to about a single dose of 240mg of oxycodone sustained throughout an entire day, and considering oxy's duration of action, that's about 750-1000mg of oxy a day, which anyone can agree is huge, yet people who use much lower dose of oxycodone will also be using those sorts of doses.  I heard of someone using 300mg of oxy a day, which is already a fair bit, but then got put on 32mg of bupe, which is absolutely insane!!!  

If you abuse Suboxone and quit cold turkey, the withdrawals are equivalent to a smaller equivalent dose of another opioid, but they last for much longer.  This is actually extremely advantageous when tapering off suboxone however because with the right dose reductions, withdrawals can really become minimal despite their duration.  Quitting cold turkey however is hell and something that a scarily large number of kratom user somehow manage to try.  I know loperamide used to be a long lasting opioid I was using and I could get away with using it only once a day, much like suboxone, even though it still lasts a slightly shorter amount of time.  Quitting it cold turkey was no fun, and while it definitely was a little less psychologically taxing (not physically.  Physical symptoms of withdrawals actually lasted almost a month after psychological withdrawals have become more manageable.  This makes sense with a peripherally restricted opioid like loperamide), everything lasted a lot longer and it was very tiring.  I eventually relapsed temporarily after about a month and then quit cold turkey off oxy another month later which wasn't as bad and shorter lasting.  Before this actual attempt at sobriety, I have experienced oxy and hydro withdrawals pretty thoroughly when I wouldn't have access to anything, so I did have something to compare my other withdrawals to.  But none of what I experienced with all these other drugs could even remotely compare to my experience with kratom.  

I tried tapering, and even a total of a ~5-7g dose reduction from my 35-45gpd habit resulted in unbearable mood swings.  I started suboxone at about 10mg and a fairly large dose reduction of about 3-4mg (tbh I don't recall the exact number at this point but it was one of these numbers on my first drop) was pretty painless relatively speaking.  It's not like it was fun, but it was actually doable, which wasn't the case for me with kratom.  Kratom wd were hellish.  I never felt the rapid fire negative thoughts like I was in a bad trip quite like I did quitting the plant, and physical pain that was somehow worse than the physical pain I felt quitting other opioids.  A simple shower felt like I was getting barraged by pellets and rocks.  I was lucky to have even gotten to the shower.  Not to mention the sweats, chills, hot flashes, severe nausea and some vomiting, uncontrollable shakes, movements, crying, shits, and yawning, goosebumps, waves of panic and terror, restless leg syndrome, high blood pressure and heart rate, shortness of breath, severe orthostatic hypotension, derealization and depersonalization, and probably a whole bunch of symptoms I simply can't remember on the spot.  I experienced maybe 75% of those symptoms quitting off other opioids and even less coming off suboxone and at a significantly lower intensity.  Not only that but with other opioids, I managed to feel genuine joy as you mentioned as well as intense pain while quitting which was a huge driving factor to get sober.  But on kratom, there was no such thing.  Just manic suffering

I think suboxone can be itself either awesome or the worst thing ever, but that will mainly depend on how you use the drug.  Regardless however, it's no small feat to quit the drug.  Kratom is a drug that can help some people immensely and ruin others.  I've had many people tell me or comment elsewhere that their kratom withdrawals were much worse than withdrawals from anything else."
quittingkratom,fqp17dg,t3_gjweej,1589531383.0,"Yup, kratom numbed me of all my human emotions and left me more deeply depressed than ever before, unmotivated to work, go outside, engage in fun activities, and even partake in basic hygeine.  When I quit, I had withdrawals worse than withdrawals from any other opioid and drug I abused, but with those withdrawals came a rapid return of my humanity, even if I was still sluggish from the stimulant withdrawal syndrome like effect that accompany kratom wd.  I wish you the best of luck with sobriety.  It really does pay off."
quittingkratom,fqoz6yr,t3_gk1pit,1589529439.0,"Your in luck because you are on a very low daily dose of kratom and you dose very infrequently.  Considering you've been doing this for a while, it's not surprising you're gonna get some mild withdrawal symptoms in-between doses.  But these withdrawal symptoms shouldn't be nearly as bad as if you were to dose more frequently, and I'm guessing that's less the issue and it's more the constant exposure to kratom.  What I would do is take some sick days off to detox, which really shouldn't take that long (5 days).  The only way you can realistically get off is without the constant exposure to the drug you get at your job.  After you feel withdrawals are gone, if you feel you can go back to the job without getting hooked again (this means you can't touch it anymore) then that's great.  If you feel you can't stay off, I would say get a new job.  It might sound extreme, but if you seriously can't stay sober and kratom is a negative influence in your life, it may be your best option."
quittingkratom,fqoucjo,t3_gjpqg7,1589525114.0,"Clonidine does have its own discontinuation syndrome that's more mild than opioid withdrawals but not non-existent.  Do you also have high blood pressure and/or heart rate as well as anxiety?  That could be directly related to the dyspnea and maybe even the perceived weakness.  Try to get back on at a lower dose and taper off relatively slowly.  I personally didn't have many symptom getting off, but I did have a significant rise in blood pressure and a fair bit of anxiety for about a week.  If you already have a high blood pressure and heart rate, I can imagine it being a problem."
quittingkratom,fqotgwr,t3_gji8b6,1589524360.0,"I would still be wary of addiction because the alkaloid itself that causes nmda antagonism, rhyncophylline, is first of all a very weak antagonist (50-100 times weaker than ketamine), and second of all is found in very very low concentration throughout the plant (generally <1% of all alkaloids).  What's most likely gonna determine how addicted you get is how well you metabolize the relatively non-addictive mitragynine into the much more powerfully addictive 7-hydroxymitragynine as well as how much 7-hydroxymitragynine is present itself in the plant.  If you find kratom feels very similar to other opioids and are struggling to regulate your usage and worried about addiction, all you can do is look for low alkaloid, in particular 7-oh-mitragynine, strains and take them with a cyp3a4 inhibitor if you have access to one you can safely take with kratom.

To better prevent addiction to and dependence on opioids in general (I wouldn't really expect these methods to eliminate the possibility of withdrawals), you can use other more powerful nmda antagonists (eg ketamine, mxe, dxm(watch out for serotonin syndrome when used with kratom and several other opioids)), Ginseng, and yohimbine among probably a lot of other things.  Ginseng and Nmda antagonists have been demonstrated to directly reduce opioid tolerance while yohimbine has been demonstrated to cause symptoms of withdrawals in people already dependent on opioids and theoretically as a result reduce tolerance.  Using these methods while already dependent may induce certain aspects of withdrawals, eg Ginseng pretty reliably induced anxiety, perspiration, palpitations and stomach upset whenever I took it, dissociatives caused severe fatigue and yawning that were reminiscent of withdrawals although they still caused euphoria (except for dxm), and yohimbine pretty reliably eliminated the pleasant sedative effects of opioids while mimicking the hyper-noradrenergic state of opioid withdrawals."
quittingkratom,fqo5cac,t3_gj6wki,1589507885.0,"Personally had withdrawals worse than I did from any other opioid or frankly any other drug which I used (amphetamine and Ritalin for several years, nicotine for a few months to a year, benzos for a few months, cannabis for a year, and ssris for about 5 years.  I definitely didn't have benzo dependence as bad as others as I was much more able to quit them after a month of very heavy consistent use than I was opiates after a similar time) and I know a lot of people in a similar situation with kratom, suffering more from it than other opioids, with some even saying withdrawals are worse than alcohol withdrawals.  I ultimately had to taper off suboxone to help get of kratom.  I've abused oxy, hydro, heroin (occasionally), and loperamide with Omeprazole whenever I couldn't get anything for about a little over a year and ultimately tried quitting off lope one time and oxy another.  Even though it was hell, I finally succeeded in quitting for six months and then went on to abuse kratom for a similar amount of time, although maybe just a little while longer.  After just a few months of consistently abusing, withdrawals were already something else.  A suboxone taper was surprisingly much better than a kratom taper could've ever been and it has been my savior, but by saying this I have gotten immense amounts of shit from people who probably never even tried suboxone in their life or tried to quit it cold turkey and at doses well above an equivalent dose of the previous opioid they were abusing.  Someone who said they used to use 90mg of oxy a day (don't get me wrong, that's not a ""easy"" habit to quit) claimed that suboxone was the worst thing he ever tried for withdrawals and he was on 16mg, which is fucking insane if you know anything about buprenorphine and it's strength compared to other ops.  Kratom can be an angel or the devil when it comes to dependence, and it will all depend on your metabolism of the alkaloid mitragynine into 7-oh-mitragynine (the much more potently addictive alkaloid in kratom), the strain you use and it's alkaloid content, obviously the amount you use, and even the specific plants you have used as kratom's alkaloid concentration will vary greatly between individual plants within a certain strain.  I do believe that some people get coffee or mild ssri/nic like withdrawals, but I also believe those people used low quality kratom or had a poor metabolism.  Kratom dependence personally has been a massive struggle and it really sucks that people can't be a little more honest about kratom's one truly major negative effect, addiction, out of fear that by being more objective about the negatives of this plant, it will be made illegal.  It's true that making it illegal would be a huge mistake because it needs to be more thoroughly researched and it's alkaloids or synthetic derivatives should replace currently used opioid medications that are killing hundreds of thousands of people.  But people should be informed about what can happen when you abuse kratom like you would any other opioid so that they don't think it's an exception, which it really isn't."
Drugs,fqink85,t1_fodyr5u,1589398382.0,"In my recent experiences with it, I actually haven't noticed very much vasoconstriction, except on one occasion where I redosed many times at intervals that were way too close together.  However the vasoconstrictive effects don't get much worse than, for example, methcathinone and a few other recreational stimulants.  I would say it's not even as bad as caffeine at doses that leave you equally awake.  I also figured out that in crystalline form, it makes for a pretty good smoke at relatively small doses that, from my memory is a bit of a dirtier high than smoked amphetamine, but not in a bad way; there seems to be pretty much the same noradrenergic anxiogenic effects that make you slightly uppity and alert for the same calming, focusing and energetic dopamine release, but there is more of that serotonergic effects that make you relaxed, peaceful, touchy feely, and full of yawns when compared to amphetamine.  I think if anything, it's more vasoconstrictive not because it's more adrenergic but rather because it very poorly crosses the blood brain barrier because of the lack of a benzene ring.  It's also extremely addictive if smoked, even though there seems to be very little comedown compared to other smoked stimulants that would usually drive me to redose.  So that's something I'm gonna reserve for special occasions.  For studying, I'm only gonna do intrabuccal usage and snorting occasionally with plenty of breaks and at relatively low doses (100mg max, although usually less works fine for me)."
Drugs,fqihs69,t3_girdlu,1589396170.0,"These urges urges that come on such a short time after trying to quit suck royally and are something I only experienced coming off stimulants.  When I quit opioids for example, I had simply the desire to quit during the first few days, but by day three, even though I was experiencing hell, I realized I truly had absolutely no desire to touch the drugs as I realized the value of the human emotions I was getting back and this helped me stay clean.  But when I quit off amphetamine and Ritalin (and nic too ig), I only felt less than human and dead inside in every way possible, and as a result I craved the drugs almost immediately.  They made me feel so normal while on them.  I was free of the constant mental fog and anxiety that leads to impulsivity, jumpiness, distractibility, etc and ruins my ability to work and function normally.  Afterall, I was and still am ADHD, but with ADHD comes a greatly increased potential to get addicted to any drug, which is why if you have ADHD, don't try to abuse your medication by using it at much higher doses or by other methods.  Even if you don't turn into that hyperactive coke head bouncing off the walls from excitement and instead you turn into a normal human capable of socializing, focusing on the tasks you need to focus on, controlling excitement, etc. it's simply not worth doing more than you really should.  By the end you will be worse off than you ever thought you could be.  And if you do just do stimulants for the rush of excitement, know that what comes up must come down, and with any recreational drug (with the exception of Psychedelics, deliriants if you consider them recreational, and more or less dissociatives), if you find yourself using it frequently you will come down harder than you can possibly imagine with most natural human experiences."

I've personally abused oxy, hydro, and occasionally heroin and loperamide w/ Omeprazole for a year and a half and quit CT which was hell, but my withdrawals from and dependence on kratom were far far worse than withdrawals from standard opioids or frankly any other drug I abused, which included amphetamine and Ritalin for many years, benzos for a couple months, nicotine and cannabis.  Although I get shit for mentioning this, I ultimately successfully used suboxone to taper because I simply couldn't quit or taper off of kratom.  I'm not saying it's something that happens to everyone and some people for whatever reason feel no withdrawals, but a lot of people who abuse kratom as they would other opioids had a similar experience to me.  The dependence itself also came with extreme depression and anxiety issues, lack of motivation, hair falling out, occasional palpitations, etc.  Life was hell.  Its cheaper than any drug addiction if it's legal where you live, but no dependence is worth any amount of money unless it truly helps you as is the case with antidepressant users and people who use opioids correctly for pain."

Btw, fuck dip.  Stuff makes you feel so weird and it gets you hooked so fucking fast.  The amount of nic you get from it is absolutely ridiculous and hard to get from simple cigarettes so the withdrawals are on a whole other level.  I knew a kid who used to use dip from age 11 to 13 or some shit.  It was weird cause he seemed like a totally normal person.  Poor bastard went to hell and back to get off that shit.

I'm not alone in this either.  Kratom is a weird drug and it's effects and potential to cause a dependence varies greatly from person to person and from strain to strain.  Even within individual strains, some specific plants and brands can be more capable of causing addiction.

You asked us if your experience sounds like a simple religious experience or a psychosis and everyone here seems to agree that what you said you experienced doesn't reflect normal human perception, yet in your replies to people's comments it almost seems like you want to keep justifying your experience despite our concern, which is totally understandable.  It's ok to be afraid to face the fact that you may be experiencing a psychosis, no matter how real, spiritual, crystal clear or significant it may feel.  Not all psychoses are jumbled foggy fever dreams, and in fact they very frequently reflect just the clarity you described almost perfectly.  But the thing is that your subjective perception of reality is very literally all you have, and by trying to find reasons for why your experience is normal, which I can assure you it sounds anything but normal, you may be throwing away your entire perception of reality, especially considering that psychotic disorders frequently get worse and worse over time without proper medical treatment.  The antipsychotic medication your doctor will give you can only truly stop psychosis if you catch it in an early stage, but if you let it develop, there may be no saving you.  All it will do is prevent it from getting much worse.  What I think you need to do is go to a psychiatrist asap and get checked out.

Someone else for example recognized patterns in numbers and related synchronicities  that weren't really there and created the association with Christianity, only to go deeper and deeper into a full blown psychosis with fake rituals he created to appease beings he felt and ""knew were there"" but weren't really there.

AskDrugNerds,fqbw8vr,t3_ghd0xw,1589245151.0,"First of all, codeine and tramadol are metabolized at different rates.  Desmetramadol and morphine are equipotent opioids, but tramadol is more poorly metabolized into it's corresponding active metabolite than codeine and therefore it takes a higher dose of tramadol in general to get the same effect.  On top of this, there are many more metabolic processes that break down both tramadol and codeine as well as their active metabolites.  For example, the n-demethylation of tramadol and codeine and their metabolites varies and renders them inactive.  Not only that, both tramadol and it's active metabolite are SNRIs and NRIs respectively giving them very different effects from plain old codeine and morphine and rendering tramadol less potently sedating among other things, but still fairly good at relieving pain.  In fact, the activity of serotonin and norepinephrine actually increases pain relief considerably, especially for neuropathic pain.  Tramadol also has some mild serotonin releasing properties.  Tramadol and desmetramadol are also mu opioid g-coupled protein receptor selective agonists like kratom which means they produce less respiratory depression than codeine and morphine among other things, but tramadol is still dangerous at higher doses because it acts as a powerful delta opioid receptor agonists and gabaA receptor antagonist/inverse agonist, potentially causing seizures in overdose."

For example, personally with opioid addiction, I took psychedelics and all of a sudden realized that if I continue, I'm not going to succeed in college, my emotions will stay numb, I won't feel joy and pain from natural cues for positive and negative emotions (it's a lot worse than it sounds), I will waste money on this stupid drug, etc.  But these were all things I already understood well before my trip.

Drugs,fq1ux5r,t1_fpyu7y9,1589049699.0,"I'm currently sober now.  I don't deal with chronic pain, or at least none that I treat.  I've had my fair share of severe lower and mid back (left rhomboid in particular) muscle strains from pushing myself too hard during deadlifts and squat with poor mobility and hence limited quality of form, but I never thought of getting the pain treated even though I definitely should have and probably still should.  I should at least get some prescription grade nsaids or something, or maybe even some gabapentin.  Currently cannabis is keeping aches somewhat at bay but it's nowhere near enough.  I also can't smoke too frequently because some of the cognitive effects I see as negatives that I can't afford to deal with on a daily basis.  I doubt I would have fared well with a constant supply of opioids from a doctor.  I would've cycled those opioids like crazy lol, just to get to try each and every option and run through those scrips like candy.  I've never had the misfortune of encountering Dilaudid and neither do I know anyone who had Dilaudid.  I'm glad I still don't.  And I feel you on the suboxone thing.  Especially during the first few hours after I took my dose, it either would make me anxious and panicked in a weird way or suddenly very zombie-like and wonky before just leaving me feeling pretty normal, and to be honest I personally wouldn't have liked to use it recreationally, but I can definitely see how it can be abused.  I can imagine it creating a hell of a nod at high doses.  The opioids I've tried were oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, tramadol, heroin, fentanyl (suspected in heroin that only came with a strong initial kick), methadone (once in a recreational setting), loperamide with Omeprazole, suboxone, and kratom.  Only opioid I've ever been prescribed is Tylenol 3 for wisdom teeth and a ingrown toenail infection (ik, TMI).

This will sound strange, but kratom was probably my drug of choice.  I even remember trying hydrocodone some time deep into my kratom addiction and thinking that it was chill and blissful, and even though I didn't take a particularly large dose (snorted 20mg and ate 10mg), I knew it would never have that stimulant kick of kratom that personally can send euphoria into overdrive.  I would say that if you feel that way about the kratom you are currently using, then stick to that(those) strain(s) and brand(s).  I've had kratom strains that felt nice and stimulating more than anything with little of the classic opioid euphoria that'll get you hooked, and I've had strains that resembled more than anything an oxy and amphetamine speedball (usually more oxy than amphetamine and the stimulation always also felt mildly serotoninergic).  I would abuse that kratom like crazy.  A lot of people say spins will prevent you from upping your doses too high, but either I have already developed a tolerance to spins, or that strain simply didn't cause them.  It vaguely reminded me of when I would occasionally abused Ritalin in combination with oxy a while before I actually became dependent on opioids.

Clonidine can help with a lot of symptoms that gabapentin sometimes doesn't cover to well, at least ime.  Clonidine can really kill wd anxiety, sweats, hypertension and tachycardia, shortness of breath, and it can also make sleep a little easier.  Hydroxyzine really only works well for anxiety and sleep ime and is generally really benign in comparison to clonidine and gabapentin.  Combining clonidine with gabapentin ime has been extremely helpful during one of my tries at getting sober and has helped on a couple of my suboxone dose reductions later on.  Clonidine and cannabis was extremely useful for getting through the first day sober before getting onto suboxone, but the second day just before I got my suboxone was still hell even with some clonidine still in my system.

As for your problem with your constant supply of Dilaudid, I would say first see if kratom withdrawals really are something you can manage.  Then, I would try to speak directly to your doctor about your intentions to try to lower your dose, and if he is insistent on maintaining you at your current dosage, I would honestly purposefully try to return some pills to the pharmacy as soon as you get them (don't dump pills in the toilet or throw them away.  Return any pills you don't need anymore).  If you feel you can switch between kratom and hydromorphone seemlessly and you really feel that your current problem that is keeping you stuck on opioids is that your doctor keeps loading hydromorphone onto you, I would slowly begin lowering that quantity of hydromorphone each month.  Maybe even tell him you want to switch again to something a little gentler and/or go to a lower dose cause hydromorphone is pretty well known to be a pretty hard core opiate.  That's a tricky situation to be stuck in and I would be careful with this last piece of advice as this is just what I, some stranger who's never been in this exact situation, would personally do and I would definitely always start with the advice of your doctor."
Drugs,fpyad7m,t1_fpy1lm4,1588999680.0,"With kratom, you might actually be doing a good thing.  Kratom for some people actually really just has mild withdrawals, and with kratom being a plant and one of its alkaloids being metabolized into a more active and addictive opioid (mitragynine to 7-oh-mitragynine), kratom withdrawals are really gonna change according to the the specific strain you take and the person taking it.  You may benefit from testing the waters and seeing how cutting down your dose is.  Remember that you can always switch between various opioid treatment medications.  I wouldn't switch back too quickly to something like methadone because it can still cause respiratory depression.  I wouldn't even touch other short acting opioids anymore if you're already on kratom, although I have heard of a few people who switched to tramadol from kratom and actually successfully quit tramadol instead, but this is a huge risk you shouldn't take.  In my case, a suboxone taper was the only thing that helped me get clean.  Some people prefer either suboxone over methadone, but also vice versa for various reasons.  The only thing with suboxone is when switching on it, you need to stay sober about a day from opioids.  Some people can tough wd out with non opioid medications, like clonidine, gabapentin (don't use phenibut and only use pregablin in really severe cases), hydroxyzine, cannabis, etc.  Some of these medications actually really work surprisingly well without producing much of a dependence of their own.  You gotta explore your options and keep in mind that there is unfortunately no way to escape the pain, only ways to make it a little better.  If you can, try exercising during or immediately after withdrawals.  It can really provide relief, albeit very it's temporary, but it's relief nonetheless.  It can also help with sleep, which is huge.  Don't take Benadryl, melatonin, or other antihistamine formulations for sleep.  Melatonin naturally worsens restless leg and Benadryl and other OTC antihistamines also frequently act as serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, potentially severely worsening anxiety and consequently sleep.  Eat healthy and quit at your own pace.  Do it during a time where there aren't many external demands (eg school/work projects, family conflicts, etc).  If you simply don't feel your mentally prepared yet, think if it's really worth postponing, cause with that postponer attitude you are only prolonging the inevitable and you may never find a good time to quit.  And be patient.  Sobriety is a process, especially the first year of PAWS, which basically consists of bouts of cravings, anxiety, depression, maybe even mild physical withdrawal-like symptoms that come around every month or so.  I would say that it DOES get easier after acutes though, but then you really gotta put the work in to make sure that your life is conducive to sober living (eg cut off any plugs (forget their number completely), throw away ANY opioids in your house, find better ways to cope (mindfulness, exercise, meditation, hobbies)).  This is the best help I can give you.  I wish you the best of luck.  And remember that sobriety and feeling human emotions you repress with opioids is not that bad and can actually feel really good.  It's great not to feel numb."
Drugs,fpx5nm1,t1_fpmns5q,1588976128.0,"I hope you realize just how dumb this comment and this whole discussion you started with your calling bullshit on my experience with krstom is.  It truly is amazing how you ask me if I tapered on kratom, I tell you I did and it was a hell, worse than a sub taper, and then you complain how it actually doesn't matter in your opinion.  Not only that, you go as far as to claim I didn't respond to you, which is something you simply can't do when I did very directly lol.  I even went as far as to give you my experience with another long lasting opioid, but why should that matter...  Fuck me.  All this to defend some unproven notion that kratom can treat opioid dependence in all those that use it.  Not only that, you don't seem to understand suboxone dosing AT ALL, and took the maximum effective dose (16 mg is the ceiling dose) that would be equivalent to something like 70g of kratom (maybe even more or less depending on the kratom strength), over a gram of heroin, or something like 500+mg of oxy a day.  Then you doubled it at 32mg, an ineffective dose that is either prescribed by inexperienced doctors or doctors that want to play their patients.

I'm currently clean off suboxone and have no real PAWS because of my taper, and I'm really just surprised at how smoothly it went even if it took a while.  You took a stupid amount of Suboxone for what you were probably dosing with other opioids/kratom and suffered the consequences.  I can imagine that if you took 25g of kratom, and 16 mg of bupe, the ct withdrawals of bupe must have been more/equally intense and longer lasting.  That's common sense, because they aren't remotely equivalent doses.  Taking an appropriate dose of bupe results in withdrawals that are less intense but still longer lasting, but when you do small dose reductions, wd really are just waves of brief anxiety, aches, stomach discomfort, and depression that wash over you every once in a while over the course of a few weeks to a month.  It reminded me of Lexapro withdrawals after doing 20mg for several years, which to me wasn't that bad and came with both depression and a return of positive emotions, very similarly to bupe.  A kratom taper will never be remotely like that for me.  That is just the nature of kratom for me: far more euphoric and way more painful when I ultimately quit."
Drugs,fpwq9uu,t1_fpjp0jo,1588967998.0,"Tbh, even if a human was tortured most of their life, I believe it can be hard to imagine either severe opioid or severe benzo wd just based off any normal human experiences, but maybe this is just ime and I'm actually a pussy who has never truly suffered lol.  I've had brief moments in life where I had traumatic experiences of varying degrees or experienced the depression of mild to moderate opioid withdrawals and periods of intense anxiety, panic,  sensation of mania that I better associated with benzo withdrawals, but there is so much more suffering to withdrawals, and when they get severe it really can blow natural experiences out of the water.  The mind can definitely produce a whole lot of pain with the extra push of chemicals, or the lack thereof.  It's also the case that these people who experience traumas frequently abuse these drugs and ultimately get hooked on them, unable to get off.  But I totally get your point, and it's definitely true.  And at the same time, another interesting thing to take into consideration is that some people experience the intensity of various drug withdrawals differently.  Some people consider nicotine withdrawals to be worse than opioid withdrawals, and many people feel very much the complete opposite way (I know I feel the latter), even though they smoked  tobacco/Vaped or abused opioids in similar amounts.  Personally, when I started abusing benzos, I ultimately quit after the first two months of abuse and to be frank, it wasn't the worst experience, and I also wasn't using small quantities or infrequently.  I definitely was craving a lot and was feeling anxious, jumpy, and pretty aggressive.  I had a mild panic attack that was triggered by a very small family argument.  It actually somewhat reminded me of my experience with nicotine withdrawals, especially with the cravings.  But by the first month and a half of opioid use when I first tried to quit, withdrawals were surprisingly intense already and I simply wasn't willing to quit at that point.  Probably because I was already depressed, and quitting just sent me into a DEEP depression I couldn't manage at all.  I went on to abuse them for a really long time before just manning up and quitting CT.  I didn't feel the same aggressive mania of benzo withdrawals, but it was an emotional and physical hell that felt worse that withdrawals from nicotine, SSRIs, cannabis and amphetamines/Ritalin abuse which were the only drugs I've used for an equivalent time or longer.  I was sober for six months and then tried kratom and ended up abusing it just like an opioid for a similar period of time and felt withdrawals far far worse than the withdrawals from opioids, kratom being a drug that is generally considered incapable of producing withdrawals anything like other opioids.  And despite all this, I don't see the point of calling people pussies for going through cannabis, antidepressant, caffeine, nicotine, etc withdrawals that people will either say are mild or even non-existent.  It's all relative and for all I know they are in their own personal hell and need help to succeed in their goal of sobriety.  No point in being a dick."
quittingkratom,fptd6b0,t1_fpswf9m,1588889096.0,"Thank you.  It's truly unreal the amount of hate I got for simply having experienced what I have experienced with both kratom and buprenorphine.  Its almost as if people think that if a single case of someone not having a good experience with kratom comes out, they're done for, and because I could taper off suboxone, it must be the end of the world.  Some people are ridiculous.  Kratom's alkaloid 7-oh-mitragynine which is present on it's own in relatively high doses and is also a metabolite of mitragynine, has been demonstrated to be as capable of producing an addiction and dependence as does any other opioid but is many times as potent as morphine or heroin (~17 times more potent than morphine), so at relatively average doses (eg 5g) of kratom there is plenty of potential for addiction.  There is simply no reason for it's PAWS to be any different from the PAWS of other opioids.  If you use oxycodone at consistent doses and without the intent to abuse it as people frequently do on kratom (and on prescribed oxy), you get some pretty mild short lived paws from it, but kratom has the stigma of a medicinal plant and oxycodone is more frequently regarded as a drug of abuse even though they both can be abused in the same fashion.  A lot of people don't even portray kratom as a drug that's even capable of being abused.  It's a plant that has caused me and a whole bunch of other people I know and don't know a lot of pain and suffering and it disturbs me.  I want it to be legal and it's alkaloids to replace all other pharmaceutical opioids, but while it stays legal, we should be more honest about it's side effects and potential for harm (eg addiction and dependence, depression and anxiety with abuse, drowsiness, impaired memory, hair loss, etc).  It's ok for it to have these side effects and by making them known there will be less people getting in trouble with kratom and counter-intuitively less backlash on the plant, something that should be obvious to the many advocates, addicts and sellers who spread dangerous lies about it."
quittingkratom,fpt3dmm,t1_fpsvt8i,1588884162.0,"Thank you.  Ffs no one I have spoken to has had paws of less than 6 months long with kratom and those were people who dosed much like you for a year, so I simply don't think it's realistic to say 3 months unless you were dosing maybe ~10gpd for a few months.  If you're actually stuck with kratom addiction and abusing it, upping your doses continuously as you would an opioid, it's gonna cause pretty much the same kind of PAWS.  That is the unfortunate nature of kratom and all other opioids."

AskDrugNerds,fpn0g7i,t3_ge7k2s,1588746574.0,"I'm fairly certain in overdose the reason for it's hallucinations is more due to its potential to cause stimulant psychosis.  All stimulants come with the same warning about hallucinations.  Nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, while their activities are related in certain parts of the body and brain, carry somewhat different roles overall.  From what I understand, other nicotinic acetylcholine antagonists generally don't cause delirium.  Instead they frequently cause strong sedation, anxiolysis, and paralysis.  Also it seems muscarinic agonists and antagonists have a much more direct effect on the heart, agonists increasing bp and heart rate, and antagonists doing the very opposite, sometimes to a very dangerous extent which seems to be one of the main dangers with them other than seizure."

Drugs,fpmya5m,t1_fpmns5q,1588744893.0,"You're a truly ridiculous person...  I'M A PROPONENT OF KRATOM TOO!  I SIMPLY SHARED MY EXPERIENCE WITH KRATOM AND SUBOXONE AND IT SENT YOU INTO A HISSY FIT!

>You replied to zero things in my previous post and just repeated yourself. Taking the max dose of Kratom and comparing your wd to a taper of not the max dose of suboxone is ridiculous. You did not cold turkey subs and therefore you and I both know you have no personal experience with what you claim to talk about. 

I responded well enough to your comment but your clearly struggling with reading.  Probably all that lead in your kratom...  I even gave you my experience quitting another long lasting opioid, but clearly everything I said about that went right over your head.  I know just what it's like.  There is no doubting it's less immediately intense but longer lasting and as a result it does suck more than shorter acting opioids.  But clearly buprenorphine is the only long lasting opioid in your mind.
Now I know for a fact you're completely full of shit because no doctor prescribes more than 16mg of buprenorphine since any sub dose above that doesn't have any effect because buprenorphine saturates opioid receptors at that dose.  32mg is WAY above sub's ceiling dose for any human.  You can cut a 32mg dose to 16mg a day painlessly as result.  I wish I could find the reddit post on either r/suboxone or r/quittingopioids of someone doing just that and saying he felt some mild symptoms like he dropped 1-2mg.  If you were prescribed 32mg and took it for however long you were on Suboxone, you wasted money and got played by your doctor.  And to believe that most people are prescribed 16mg a day is simply not grounded in reality.
Now let's do a little elementary school math here.  1mg of buprenorphine is an equivalent dose to about 60mg of morphine and 40mg of oxycodone, 15-30mg of heroin, 90mg of hydrocodone, 500-700mg of codeine, etc. Heroin always lasted a bit longer for me (usually around 5-7h when I snorted it.  Idk y.  Probably fucky metabolism or it was laced with some rc somehow, but I doubt it), but for most it lasts about 3-4hours.  Dosing 5-6 times a day 15-30mg of heroin is a decent amount, and 1mg of bupe is equivalent to that.  16mg a day is equivalent to much more than a gram of heroin a day which is not necessarily the ""common dose"" you claim it to be lol.  It's no wonder quitting sucked so much for you.  You were doing probably twice the dose you should've or more.  If you don't believe me, try to find how many people in the r/suboxone subreddit say they're prescribed 16mg+, or just do some cursory research on the subject.  And then you talk about how horrible Suboxone is, a medication that has been demonstrated in multiple studies to be incredibly effective at helping people get off opioids when used appropriately.  It's almost like you are accusing me of doing exactly what you did but the other way around...  I shouldn't even have to say any of this.  I've known people in programs who only needed 4mg.  8mg was a ""standard"" dose.  I did personally did 10mg intrabuccal films max.  That was the dose that just got me out of kratom withdrawals.  The first time I dropped my dose, I decided to start with a solid 4mg drop to test the waters.  No, it's not fun.  I'm not calling you a pussy or whatever for thinking suboxone withdrawals are so bad so stop being so hyper defensive.  But it was far better than what I went through with kratom.  I don't think I can stress how much better it was.  I waited a month or so, then dropped 1.5mg, waited a couple weeks then 1mg, etc.  All of it reminded me of quitting Lexapro: pretty painless ime.

>I understand that you found it easier to taper subs then Kratom which was your doc at the time but that DOES NOT MAKE THE WITHDRAWAL EASIER OR MAKE SUBOXONE LESS ADDICTING. 

Well then, you clearly dont get just why kratom was so much more difficult to taper off then, other than how difficult it was to schedule dose.  You also completely contradicted yourself in your previous comments asking if I ever tapered of kratom like the absolute tard that you are, but I'm well aware that that's just a kratom advocate thing.  It was so difficult because if I did a fraction of the dose reduction I did on Suboxone with kratom it was a much more painful hell to experience, and the depression lasted a solid month and made Suboxone wd from the larger dose reduction described above look puny.  Ik it won't make any sense why that's important, but I'm not trying to convince you shit.  I'm hoping people here don't read the shit you displayed for all the world to see in your comments and get scared of trying suboxone and very literally trade their oxy addiction for another short acting opioid addiction.

>Besides the fact that 99% of Kratom users use less then a qp a day and about half of sub users are on 16-32mg and your post makes less sense because even if it was true for you , for 99% of people it wouldn’t be and going online and claiming it would be would be a danger to public health

What is even the purpose of this? You're simply making your truly uneducated guess on how much kratom addicted people take to try to show how ridiculous my dosing regime is to you, which is stupid.  I don't take too uncommon a dose especially after a year of abuse and you know that some people take way way more.  Then you go ahead and say I'm calling kratom a danger to public health when I'm calling it what it is: addictive and dependence forming in a fashion similar to other opioids.  There is simply no doubt about it.  I just gave my experience and it sparked some massive insecurity about your experience quitting a massive dose of Suboxone cold turkey.
I'm seriously done with this discussion.  I have been called out such a ridiculous amount of times for having simply experienced what I experienced with kratom and it's such a stupid and shitty thing to have to go through.  I get played into thinking I can use kratom as I have used other opioids and not get such a severe dependence, and then I get called tf out by the same people who got me here.  Absolutely hilarious.  But I would much rather people understand very real risks with kratom, which like any other drug, is not perfect.  I don't get why advocates don't see that as fair."
Drugs,fpm5p4u,t1_fplyurp,1588726095.0,"Yeah I ultimately tried to taper but failed pretty bad.  It simply wasn't working out because my emotions were out of control and keeping track of my doses was simply something I didn't feel I had time for.  I tried quitting cold turkey as well and failed catastrophically.  Ultimately I found it more difficult to quit than any other opioid I tried quitting including a long lasting one I quit cold turkey (loperamide with Omeprazole) and I tried switching to suboxone which actually worked out perfectly for me.  Tapering off of it resulted in less mood swings, I was more functional, and I only had to dose once a day so I never accidentally dosed extra times.  Apparently a lot of people disagree with me in reddit comments regarding Suboxone, but everyone I spoke to directly either through reddit or in person seemed to be a fan of it when it comes to using it to taper, so I'm very confused about the hate.  Regarding what you were saying about your friends and their withdrawals, I know I had a friend who quit a powerful RC stimulant drug called 4-methylaminorex after pretty persistent abuse and said it sucked, but he claimed it was not nearly as bad as nic.  He smoked a few cigarettes (just a fraction of a pack) a day for a while and he claimed that stimulant wd didn't even come close to his nic wd experience.  He wasn't using small quantities of that drug either.  My experience with these different classes of drugs was the complete opposite, and while I smoked a little less, I also abused ""less recreational"" stimulants (amphetamine and Ritalin mainly).  So not only are some people simply more prone to getting bad wd in general but within various drug classes the relative intensity can vary.  You can imagine with a drug like kratom that behaves in so many different ways and has so many different mechanisms that it's gonna cause a wide range of wd symptoms and severity of symptoms in different people.  I've read of people who considered quitting heroin to be similar to quitting an ssri and not really that bad (idk how true this is because this is just anecdotal evidence from various forums, but it's not something I've heard only once).  All this really makes me wonder why people aren't more open to the possibility that kratom in particular may be capable of causing worse withdrawals in some than in others, especially compared to other opioids.  There is evidence that kratom can cause moderate to severe opioid withdrawals on the COWS scale in 50% of users.  I can't find the paper anymore that found this, but I can find some people referencing the data or similar data:

https://applegaterecovery.com/is-kratom-dangerous/

Some of the info about kratom's ability to cause overdose is a little off (basically what I think they're trying to say is that if you already have opioids in your system and then take more kratom, you can od, which is true but they fail to word it as such) but they have the info from the article I am struggling to find.  There is another article from drugabuse dot com but for some reason I'm not allowed to use the website in this sub.  Go figure.  All of this is also further supported scientifically by the addictive potential of kratom's alkaloid 7-oh-mitragynine which is already present on it's own in relatively high quantities, but is also a metabolite of the alkaloid mitragynine, and is capable of producing an opioid dependence in rats at much lower doses than morphine and even heroin.

I agree that kratom is an amazing plant that is capable of a lot of good, but there is no doubting that it's capable of causing a severe dependence, the keyword being capable.  All kinds of drugs are capable of all kinds of side effects, but the side effects are listed on the side of the bottle and made widely known online.  Especially with a side effect that can affect so many people using it regularly in such a negative fashion, why aren't we being more honest about this???  I understand why some kratom advocates (and sellers) are always concerned about kratom becoming illegal, but at the same time you gotta be honest about kratom and it's side effects as you would with just about any other drug."
Drugs,fpm0qih,t1_fplgefn,1588723203.0,"You understand that I already tried to taper off kratom and that was a million times worse than tapering off sub.  I'm not sure if I mentioned that in my comment to you or the other person's comment.  You ""kratom feinds"" are so quick to find reasons to defend kratom where there simply aren't any and it's simply impossible to cover all the bases to satisfy you actual idiots even with a comment as long as a short highschool essay.  I even mentioned my experience going cold turkey off another long lasting opioid but clearly that means jack shit to you kratom fiends and your sideways ass logic.  You are insane to be defending kratom like this for all the wrong reasons.  And it's not like I was getting high off my ass on kratom by the end.  I have limited money to spend on it and 35-45 gpd was just enough to get withdrawals in between each dose.  I tried upping it all the way up to 60-80gpd and I couldn't afford it for more than a few weeks and went back down to my standard 35-45 which was itself unpleasant but that's another story.  And I was getting as ""high"" off kratom by the time I tried ct as I was on suboxone when I quit.  My Suboxone dose was equivalent to my kratom dose.  The most I could get was the sensation of being content.  Trust me when I say that as I reduced my doses by 25% each dose reduction and there is simply no way that suboxone withdrawals would've remotely come close to my experience with kratom withdrawals in intensity.  In my experience that is bullshit.  Are you some kratom vendor with some agenda to defend it by all means?  Either that or your so thick skulled and smooth brained that you would try to make kratom look like the saint in all of this, even though it was already proven in my experience to be many times worse than BENZOS AND OXY FFS!  A single five gram a day reduction in dose made my sub taper truly look like coffee withdrawals compared to Adderall cold turkey.  It's the plain and simple fact.  Why can't you accept that?  Do you need kratom to be the best drug for every human on this planet or else you're going to try to prove why those people are lying or something?  Fr you're on some shit.

Edit: can someone give me a legitimate reason why they would like this man's comment other than being a delusional kratom advocate looking to silence anyone saying kratom is anything but the perfect drug???  Ffs I simply can't cover all the bases.  Yes I did try to taper off kratom and forgot to mention that in the first comment, I even mentioned it in a comment to another person who replied to me, but there is simply no winning with you asshats.  Neither I, nor anyone else with an experience similar to mine with other opioids, including suboxone, and kratom can un-experience what we experienced, redo our kratom addiction with some extra shit kratom that is incapable of producing and opioid high and hence incapable of producing addiction or dependence, just so you pety little shits can be satisfied.  You're massive losers for buying into and obsessing so heavily over this fucking drug that is still an opioid.  I even think it should be legal after all the shit I went through with it because I still believe it's objectively better than any other opioid and needs to stay legal for the sake of research, but somehow I'm still the enemy. Grow TF up"
Drugs,fplb4up,t1_fpjgq73,1588709561.0,"You're acting like I took an outlandish dose with that last paragraph when I didn't take much more than you did.  Why do you have to act like such a prick about this lol.  If kratom withdrawals were like bad coffee withdrawals+ everything else you said, whatever tf that real meant, good for you.  I have to disagree personally.  If you check my other comment to this person, I acknowledge that kratom is a weird drug capable of causing little withdrawals in some people and more withdrawals than other opioids in others.  So many factors play into whether or not withdrawals will be mild or severe from the kratom you take and it's alkaloid content to your own metabolism of the drug. I also acknowledge that quitting Suboxone cold turkey is probably hell and gave my experience trying to quit another longer lasting opioid cold turkey, and while it wasn't a drug that lasts quite as long as sub, it still wasn't pleasant to quit off of.  I still wish kratom was nearly as easy however.  Panic attacks my ass.  But if you're smart and actually taper off the drug which  is what Suboxone is actually made for, it's really not that bad.  So just as a sidenote, please don't go around telling people not to use sub or something because you simply used it in the worst way possible.

If you check r/quittingkratom or other forums and sites regarding quitting kratom in general you'll pretty quickly find stories similar to mine as well as people making comparisons to coffee and ssris.  I've had a lot of experience with other drugs so when I say kratom was worse by miles, I'm not bullshitting.  Kratom wd PERSONALLY was undeniably a hell that was worse than that of quitting any other drug I tried, including nic (several cigs a day), amphetamines (snorting 60mg amp or 60-90mg of ritalin a day with occasional breaks to crash for many years), benzos (Ativan and diazepam at a wide range of doses for several months), and opioids (oxy 150mg and at one point 250mg a day, hydro was about 200mg a day, heroin @ .1g maxing out at .2g a day, loperamide @ max 200mg a day with 60mg of Omeprazole).  I've had plenty of people tell me that they switched from kratom to oxy, suboxone or tramadol, and ultimately feeling much better quitting or tapering.  I've also had people like you telling me it's comparable to stopping an ssri or ""coffee"", although I have to admit, people comparing their kratom withdrawals to coffee are probably lying out of fear that any sign of kratom being addictive will result in it's becoming illegal, which is bullshit because there are many more reasons for kratom to stay legal.  Those people saying kratom wasn't that bad to quit we're also mostly hyper defensive assholes defending the drug at all cost making it seem like they're still addicted and never actually quit.

Ik this is long, but I don't know a better way to get my point across so I apologize.  Being an ass to people who didn't have a good experience with kratom to try to defend it as this awesome drug incapable of producing wd as severe as other opioids or whatever your goal is is such a stupid endeavor that only results in more people lying about it's addictive properties and more people who don't actually need it getting addicted.  I wouldn't wish my experience on anyone, but the more I look the more I realize people are going through freakishly similar shit.  I've had friends in real life go through the same thing.  Not only that, it comes with all the psychological problems other opioids can cause.  I lost all motivation to go to work/classes and I could barely motivate myself to get out of bed by the end of my addiction.  I just wanted to get fucked up.  I really hope people start figuring out that while kratom is a plant with a lot of potential for good, it's not perfect and can fuck you up pretty bad."

It also was used in a clinical setting back then.  Personally tripping on opioids is what led me to quitting lol.  But hey, to each their own.  With psychedelics, ymmv in just about every respect.  I imagine this is probably gonna be the biggest hindrance to coming to any conclusion about it's potential to treat any mental disorder because in the end everyone is different.  Either way, there is no doubt that these are fascinating drugs with massive potential, whether or not be in treating addiction.

Drugs,fpjhrso,t1_fpj9zc2,1588668978.0,"Well I ultimately tried to get off at 35-45gpd and the main kratom I was using was this ultra potent green Malay, but I would occasionally mix in some white strains.  I wouldn't say it's the worst withdrawals because some people get little to no withdrawals and others experience hell on Earth.  It's definitely got something to do with the the person taking the drug and the alkaloids and how they interact with one another because kratom acts as a stimulant, antidepressant, antipsychotic, and mild sedative as well as an opioid, creating a high slightly different from opioids and as a result different withdrawals.  But the alkaloid 7-oh-mitragynine has been shown to be many times more powerful than morphine and even heroin and capable of producing a hell of a dependence itself.  It's present in the plant on it's own and is also a metabolite of mitragynine.  I tried a taper multiple times with kratom, but the fact that you have to dose many times a day (I was dosing at one point 6-8 times a day adding massive dose upon massive dose every few hours) and the constant emotional seasaw lead to confusion, relapse, and generally made it unbearable.  And then I tried cold turkey which as I already said went horribly wrong.  Before kratom, I was on oxy, hydro, and heroin (and loperamide w/ Omeprazole) for a year and a half and I quit successfully CT and made it six months sober before going on kratom for another year and a half.  Don't get me wrong, quitting opioids was hell and I was shitting, puking, crying, aching etc..  But there were genuine moments of human joy in all that craziness.  There was no return of the ability to feel joy during kratom withdrawals.  There was also this fatigue that left me unable to get out of bed the first few days and literally stiff as a board, catatonic and in pain.  It was only hell and rapid fire thoughts about suicide and all the things that make the world what I perceived as hell at the time.  There was also physical pain that outdid the pain of traditional opioid wd: drops of water in a shower felt like a rough massage of pellets and small stones and my knees ached at every small movement.  I'm pretty sure I had a small psychotic break while quitting.  The thing with sub is that it's withdrawals do drag out and quitting it cold turkey is genuinely stupid and probably hellish.  When trying to quit opioids one of my attempts was off loperamide, a longer lasting opioid, although not as long lasting as sub, and I had two weeks of wd, after which I ultimately relapsed.  I totally get how that can be horrible.  But the whole point is that by making it last so long it makes a taper so much more gentle and easier to plan out.  I don't see what people hate so much about it cause I hear so many people complaining about what hell tapering off of it is and if you just keep a steady pace, it's a hell of a lot more manageable than withdrawals from just about any other opioid, at least ime.  I've tapered off relatively quickly and while it admittedly wasn't fun, I'm clean and feeling pretty good with no PAWS so far."
Psychosis,fpj1r6a,t3_gdmm8y,1588654198.0,"If you have the thoughts but still easily distinguish them from reality, I would usually doubt it's an actual psychosis.  While I'm not saying this is necessarily you, some people are self centered or narcissistic and they literally think everything is about them when it really isn't, but it doesn't mean they are psychotic, especially if these are just fleeting thoughts.  But the connections you claim to have drawn are truly very strange and it sounds like you recognize strange ""synchronicities"" that aren't really there.  It really sounds like something straight out of an acid trip which is never a good sign lol.  I would say go to a doctor and quit the cannabis asap.  Cannabis has been demonstrated to increase the density of the 5ht2a serotonin receptors in the brain while enhancing their activity.  These receptors are involved in both depression and potentially schizophrenia's symptoms and interestingly enough is the target of classic psychedelics.  By stopping cannabis, it's possible you will feel better.  Try to ween off amphetamines as quickly you can (I wouldn't quit cold turkey).  They increase dopamine levels greatly which certainly can play a role in schizophrenia which is characterized by an overactive dopamine system.  Don't be scared of taking antipsychotics or antidepressants.  While I've never needed to take antipsychotics, I hear they are particularly unpleasant to some, but they can be the difference between a healthy and fractured mind.  Your mind and your subjective experience is really all you have so don't take this lightly.  Antidepressants also can come with some unpleasant symptoms the first few weeks, some of which I've experienced, but they work quite well for most people.  I really hope this helps.  I wish you the best of luck.  But seriously, get sober.  Your going down a fucked up path in ways you can't imagine without being already having been addicted.  I've become all too familiar with drug addiction in many forms and it's about as hellish an experience as you can imagine."

I don't say this to diminish your accomplishment.  I personally wish I could've quit opiates as quickly as I knocked benzos.  I guess I'm just special though cause all I hear is people talking about how much worse benzo withdrawals are than opioid withdrawals and in my case they neither resulted in a significant high or a significant consequent low.  They're manic, disorienting and anxiety and craving ridden, and your constantly spasming in your legs among other weird places, but to be frank I don't understand the hype.  Maybe if you get stuck on them for years or more seizure prone it can result in much more hellish or truly lethal symptoms.  

Keep going bro.  It may not look like it, but what you simply can't realize in an addicted state is how much better being sober is on your psyche.  It also sounds like you may benefit significantly from sobriety considering your physical condition.  The drugs you're taking can't be helping you.  I personally wouldn't get on kratom.  I know a lot of people who have had withdrawals from kratom that were on par with other opioid withdrawals, people who've had little to no withdrawals, and people like me who had hellish withdrawals that well outdid withdrawals from any other opioid.  Personally they made oxy/heroin/hydro, suboxone, nicotine, amphetamine, and lorazepam/diazepam withdrawals all look like a walk in the a park.  It was such an intense and non-stop broderline psychotic hell.  Im not ashamed to say I ultimately used suboxone to taper off kratom and that it was truly painless, much like getting off an ssri, especially after the hell I experienced with kratom.  It can really swing both ways.  Now that you're off opioids and you're doing fine, just stick to what you have.  I'd say keep going.  It takes a lot of hard work, but it will pay off."

When it actually comes to quitting, withdrawals are basically equivalent to withdrawals from just about any other opioid + the lethargy, brain fog and hypotension associated with stimulant withdrawals. Months after starting abuse, you are lethargic regardless of whether or not you're experiencing withdrawals and as a result general performance suffers greatly.  The loss of human emotions.  Worsening of overall depression and anxiety.  The simple cost of the plant as you begin abusing it more an more.  The loss of the desire to engage in basic human behaviors (personal hygiene, socialization, exercise, motivation, hobbies, etc).

Drugs,fpinasa,t1_fpin51x,1588644488.0,You also said you believe that you need to take psychedelics in a clinical setting for them to help.  I simply don't agree
Drugs,fpimzxx,t1_fpiel3y,1588644300.0,"Well then you're sadly mistaken.  The very reason they ever were used in a clinical setting for addiction and all sorts of other psychological ailments is because people learned outside of a clinical setting that they can be used to help people with addictive tendencies among many other negative personality traits.  Also there is no reason to deny people who say psychedelics helped them with addiction of their experience, claiming psychedelics couldn't have actually done such a thing.  All it can take is setting the intention of finding the root of your addictive personality and eliminating it.  It can really make a difference.  I don't think psychedelics reliably help people, especially when used in a fashion not conducive to personal growth, but you don't necessarily need a trained psychologist nearby to gain any benefits.  They can help with proper dosing, tough moments of terror or anxiety, and guiding questions, but in the end it's still your mind doing the brunt of the work."

If you postpone it any longer, the crash and consequent longer lasting withdrawals will be even more hellish, trust me.  True stimulant withdrawals from many months to years of abuse are a psychological torment paired with an anhedonic depression that you simply can't imagine at the moment.  You gotta be especially careful with meth which causes permanent damage to the dopamine and serotonin releasing neurons in your reward system and many other parts of the brain required for normal function.  With prolonged use, this will result in more permanent consequences than with any other stimulant.  

Switch to energy drinks as you quit.  It sounds stupid, and while caffeine, even when mixed with taurine and the stimulant Ginseng, feels nothing like illegal stimulants, it has gotten me through amphetamine/dexamphetamine and Ritalin withdrawals, which won't even remotely touch true meth withdrawals if you get to that point. They kept me at the very least somewhat functional for the next month instead of leaving me in a hypotensive and catatonic depressive state, sleeping 16h a day.  I even tried snorting caffeine powder in the form of guarana extract, 80mg a bunp, which while I can't say I would recommend to anyone due to cardiac side effects, kept me awake when I needed to be.

But when it comes to their ability to treat addictions and addictive behaviors, psychedelics played a massive role in my ultimately becoming sober and my ability to use drugs that can theoretically have recreational potential (in particular my ADHD medication) as they are meant to be used.

Nootropics,fph4291,t1_fpguvma,1588614596.0,"Yeah, I'm not denying that kratom can be an incredibly useful plant if used in the right ways and won't kill you.  That's where it outdoes heroin by miles lol.  It's alkaloids should have replaced traditional opium alkaloids in pharmaceuticals a long time ago.  If it were to be made illegal like how other opioids should be (at least for the moment as there aren't easily available and effective treatments for addiction) we would halt necessary research into how to treat and handle the opioid epidemic.  But where a lot of people are very wrong in a very problematic way about kratom is in it's potential to cause dependence, because that has been proven scientifically time and time again and it's also been shown in plenty of anecdotal evidence and surveys of regular kratom users.  By lying about it, people are getting more and more people hooked on it and counterintuitively making worse of an image for it when it comes to real data on the plant."
Nootropics,fpf7v7a,t1_fpf4do3,1588563910.0,"Well I went ~1.5 years using kratom at about 35-45 gpd which I guess would equate to abuse of other opioids.  That wasn't fun to come off of.  If you keep your use scattered as you seem to have been doing, you will be ok.  Even binges can be fine as long as you stop soon after.  A lot of people however will think that if you use it more frequently, it should be ok, but that's a risky game to play.  Tianeptine is a weaker opioid, but an opioid nonetheless.  It's also a serotonin reuptake enhancer, making it a pretty interesting compound.  When it's abused, it's said to result in a fairly unpleasant withdrawal syndrome as well."

AskDrugNerds,fpefk61,t3_gcsvay,1588546583.0,"Well the thing is that psychedelics can cause all of the things you said are associated only with schizophrenia, but psychedelics and schizophrenia are still probably not exactly the same experience.  You never seen someone who took too much LSD and thought they were god or plagued with similarly grandiose thoughts?  And also, people definitely see evil spirits on psychedelics and psychedelic are very well known to cause paranoia in some.  Maybe you haven't experienced these symptoms, but they occur fairly frequently under the influence of these compounds.  While it's hard for scientists to elucidate the relationship between serotonin in certain parts of the brain (most likely prefrontal cortex in the pyramidal neurons) and schizophrenia, it has been demonstrated that 5ht2a antagonists, especially when paired with D2 antagonists treat schizophrenia symptoms better than D2 antagonist alone, indicative that there is a correlation between the serotonergic system and schizophrenia.  It could also be more directly correlated to the mGlu2 receptor which is involved in the hallucinogenic and psychotomimetic effects of psychedelics and even to an extent dissociatives in an indirect fashion.  Certain agonists of this receptor have been shown to have a fairly powerful antipsychotic effect that may exceed the effect of classic antipsychotics and may become mainstream at one point.  There may also be a relationship with dynorphins (endogenous kappa opioid receptor agonists) which actually  have been shown to be potentially strongly related to schizophrenia's symptoms and onset (schizophrenia usually starts at a stressful life event and dynorphins play a key role in the stress response, especially in social defeat).  

This is a lot of information thrown at you in a very disorganized fashion, but I hope you find it somewhat interesting."
Nootropics,fpeb5zc,t1_fpealee,1588544013.0,"Welp I had withdrawals from kratom worse than heroin, oxy, hydro, loperamide, and Suboxone and I know a lot of people who said they had withdrawals on par or worse as well as people who said they had less severe wd.  You could say that it won't cause nearly the same financial problems and it's legal, but in terms of it's potential to cause dependence, it's practically the same as any other opioid, especially if you use it in the same fashion as other opioids (everyday, multiple times a day, upping the dose, etc).  I'm guessing you at least agree about phenibut, f-phenibit, and tianeptine cause they don't share the status of kratom."
Nootropics,fpeapfp,t1_fpdmsjv,1588543748.0,"Lol this.  If you think it's a crappy high, cool.  Good for you buddy.  But for me, honestly, compared to opioids, other stimulants, cannabis, and a whole bunch of other drugs, I can agree that it's generally gentle unless you smoke too much, but it is such a nice sensation of peace and clean calm euphoria that no other drug seems capable of.  It's just raw dopamine paired with some cognitive stimulation.  If only the cognitive aspect was present, I would agree with others and say it could be used as a nootropic.  I've used it in the past in the same fashion that OP described (a cig a day with a few puffs at random moments in the day, usually a couple puffs around noon and some at night), and what I will say is that it certainly is a risky game to play.  I stuck to 1 cig a day for the longest time, but soon I went on to ~1.5 cigs, then to ~2 cigs.  I eventually went up to about 3-5 cigs a day and realized the pattern that was all too familiar to me from experience with other drugs and I decided to stop.  It was pretty much painless at this point when I quit although I was a bit antsy and had cravings from time to time.  It was on par with some caffeine withdrawals at this point, but with any more cigs, I can imagine how it can get fairly unpleasant.  My advice to OP is stop while you still can.  It will be hard, but if you've had experience with other addictions, you will know how quickly everything can go to shit with drug addiction and how the more you postpone quitting, the worse it gets.  Stop while you're still at just 1 cig.  If you don't heed this warning, prepare for addiction"

quittingkratom,fpdw9ii,t1_fp4cpnf,1588535503.0,"I didn't interpret you as knocking me.  But I still do believe looking for excuses as to why kratom must have caused me worse withdrawals and why it generally shouldn't cause such severe withdrawals is a pointless discussion and shouldn't be used as a defense for it, which is what I thought you were trying to do.  We should just be open to other people's experiences with the drug instead of ignoring potential severe side effects for fear of it becoming illegal.  Counter-intuitively, this will result in more people becoming addicted and hence more backlash on the kratom community.  Not only that, but you're hurting real people when you start spreading false information regarding kratom's addictive potential which should be obviously problematic and just plain wrong.  I too used to do this and I feel guilty for it to be honest.  I paid dearly for it when I ultimately quit.

Regardless I hope you start feeling better.  I know that feeling your talking about at work.  About a week into going CT I had to simply talk to a college counselor and it literally took all my strength to not break down in front of her.  I was still having physical symptoms and the whole time my stomach was aching and I had chills and hot-flashes running up and down my spine and sweat and goosebumps completely covering my body and I had to tell her I was really under the weather.  She suggested that I go home but I couldn't meet her any later.  I unfortunately couldn't tell her she didn't have to worry about getting sick lol.  

Either way I wish you the best of luck.  You might wanna try some comfort meds or supplements at the very least for sleep."
quittingkratom,fp3vmvj,t1_fp3pi8v,1588286646.0,"I just want to also mention again that I don't believe kratom should be made illegal for it's addictive potential.  I think it should have replaced all opioids implemented in a pharmaceutical environment a long time ago and that making it illegal will not only halt much needed research on it, but will also drive a large group of people to use opioids that are truly much more dangerous than any of kratom's alkaloids.  The day we make kratom federally illegal is the day we give up on the opioid epidemic because it seems to be the next best thing we have atm.  But in the meantime, we should acknowledge all of its side effects and be objective about it's benefits and when it is appropriate to use (eg. unless you are prescribed codeine syrup for a flu, don't use kratom cause it has been demonstrated to be beneficial for quelling flu symptoms).  We also need to be more honest about how to use it appropriately to reap certain benefits.  For example, if you try to take kratom for depression and you use it daily, you'll quickly stop experiencing any beneficial effects as dependence sets in, whether it be mild or severe.  When I used kratom sparingly (first month of usage, I used once every other day to once every four days), it definitely worked wonders for depression and ADHD.  But as I began using it multiple times a day and upping the dose, I quickly began losing the benefits.  But if you're using kratom for pain, you will need to use it daily.  I hope you understand more my perspective on kratom because it's not like I hate the plant itself or think that it can't be beneficial in any shape or form.  I also think there is a culture around it that can be harmful and hypes up its potential benefits (sometimes people even advocate its usage for conditions kratom hasn't been demonstrated to be capable of treating) while denying definite harms (other than addiction, there are hormonal changes that come with opioids, it's a stimulant so it can be harmful to those with heart conditions, it can cause hair loss and dry mouth leading to dental damage in the long run.  Lots of kratom strains have been demonstrated to contain heavy metals which isn't an issue inherent to kratom, but worth noting nonetheless) in a way that can lead to people getting unwillingly dependent and ultimately hurt."
quittingkratom,fp3sftb,t1_fp3pi8v,1588284964.0,"I get what you're saying, but while there was a fear from a legal standpoint that did contribute to my drive to get off illicit opiates, I would say kratom ruined most aspects of my life just as bad as they did, if not worse (EXCEPT from a financial standpoint).   This was by far the biggest driving factor for me through wd.  I wanted to get off kratom just as badly, if not more because the amotivational aspect wasn't nearly as bad on other opioids where by the time I was quitting I was at least able to do things I needed to do.  Coming off kratom, I stopped feeling the need to socialize, my grades plummetted, I didn't have the motivation to do anything from going to classes to taking care of basic personal hygiene, etc.  All that stimulation it provided me got flipped on me and I was left worse than before.  It happened to me with Ritalin and amphetamine abuse in an all too familiar fashion so I'm not surprised it happened with kratom as well to be honest.  I struggle to believe it's anything other than just kratom and I really don't understand why everyone has to combat my very own experience with some random assumptions about what I did or my situation.  Maybe you were taking less kratom or ""lower quality"" kratom.  Maybe your ability to metabolize mitragynine into the more potently addictive 7-oh-mitragynine was impaired, leaving you with more stimulation and less of the classic opioid sedation.  There are just as many factors that can lead someone to having more severe withdrawals as there are that can lead to less severe ones.  It doesn't change the fact that kratom, when referring to it's addictive properties, shouldn't be regarded any different to any other opioid, cause I wouldn't wish anyone to go through something remotely similar to what I went through.  The only way to prevent that is by making it known that kratom can do that instead of treating kratom addiction as taboo or something that doesn't really happen or only happens to people who've never tried opioids.  If you know it can happen, it's your choice on how to use it.  If I knew what would've happened, I would've either never touched it or at least use it in great moderation.  As for Suboxone, getting off long lasting opioids cold turkey or any long lasting drug in general is hell on Earth.  I got off it with a many month long taper, and the withdrawals were minor to say the least.  They lasted a fair bit and would come in waves of anxiety, but they weren't anything I couldn't handle."

quittingkratom,fow9fpt,t3_g9r5gs,1588115476.0,"Quitting kratom can be anything from painless to hell on Earth for people using at just about any dose.  How severe your withdrawals are gonna be depends on the kratom you take and yourself.  Some kratom strains have very little antidepressant, antipsychotic, sedative and most importantly opioid and stimulant effect per gram in the first place that can lead to dependence, or they cause negative effects like spins at low doses simply because all strains and even individual kratom plants vary.  If you've ever gotten a bad kratom batch, you know this all too well.  Some people don't get very severe opiate or stimulant withdrawals by nature and metabolism of mitragynine to 7-oh-mitragynine will also determine kratom's addictive potential at a specific doses considering 7-oh-mitragynine is the component of kratom most responsible for it's addictive potential and is many times more potent than morphine and heroin so very little is required for drastic effects.  But whatever boat you're in with kratom, quitting after prolonged heavy usage can still be one of the most rewarding things ever.  I know I've been to hell and back with it and suffered more while quitting kratom than opioids like oxycodone, hydrocodone, heroin, loperamide w/ Omeprazole, and Suboxone, but when I quit I gained back my human emotions that I have been craving desperately ever since I realized how numbed they have been.  Kratom is said to have antidepressant effects, which may be true for the first few weeks and quickly disappears as dependence sets in for obvious reasons.  The best thing for my depression was quitting kratom and never touching it ever again. I hope if you're out there dependent on kratom and suffering and you read all the way through this, you consider quitting.  It will be hell for a long while, there's no denying it.  But you will be capable of experiencing the same euphoria kratom provides without having to take a dose at 4 hour intervals"

However, I wasn't as tech savvy as you and I had no idea how on Earth to use the dark web.  I eventually bought Adderall from a friend with a massive scrip and was weening off and that stuff was incredible, but it came with a hell of a crash and somehow I felt Ritalin was cleaner in it's stimulation in that it was pure joy without very much noradrenaline rush.  I graduated soon to benzos because they destroyed crashes and I generally really liked their euphoria.  I tried Xanax and liked it but it was too impairing and drowsy of a high and actually found Ativan to be immensely anxiolytic and as a result euphoric and not impairing until I go into higher doses than the ones which were recreational.  I went on to oxy pills and I believed this was the best thing I've ever discovered.  While the euphoria wasn't quite Adderall euphoria or even Ritalin euphoria, it was the perfect combination of anxiety relief and somehow stimulated joy.  Little did I know this perfect high was gonna come bite me in the ass later on.  At the beginning, I was fine using it every other day or so, but that quickly changed to dosing once a day.  Pretty soon, I was popping pills three times a day and went through a massive oxy script like it was nothing.  After just three weeks of using daily, I was a shakey anxious mess and I told the few friends I had that I thought I was coming down with the flu.  That's when something very unfortunate happened.  I had a friend outside of my school who cracked a joke about me lookin like I was in heroin withdrawals, and I was honest and said, ""yes that's actually exactly what's going on.  I recently went on a bender"".  He knew someone who knew a plug who got cheap pharmaceutical pills and from then on, shit went downhill fast.  Really fast.  This all happened during my senior year of high school.  My grades plummetted.  I started trading Ritalin pills and personal belongings for the drugs and I would just tell my parents I kept losing things (which did happen on occasion and would piss me off).  I traded out a few pieces of my mom's jewelry which scored me more oxy/hydro, but it was never enough.  I was also using loperamide w/ Omeprazole when I couldn't afford the pills, which is a horrible idea for your heart but it was all I haf.  I eventually realized this was financially unsustainable and decided to just give heroin a shot.  I bought a whole gram, and I snorted just a little Smidgeon at first that I eyeballed.  The light brownish powdery substance had a faint smell of vinegar until it was up in your nose and it burnt like hell, but then the calm began to wash over me gently.  I was surprised how little I actually needed instead of the five Percocet 10s I would usually have taken.  Then I remembered I had a pretty accurate scale I used for a science fair a long time ago.  I replaced the batteries and tried it out.  I had to weigh out a slightly higher dose than what I wanted and then cut it up into fractions.  Frankly, I was terrified every time I did this because I knew that I was still basically eyeballing my doses and that the density of the powder itself could vary in spots.  It could also be unevenly laced with fentanyl or some other designer drug that has never been researched in humans.  I didn't like doing heroin often for this reason.  God I'm so glad I'm past that point.  If you get sober, life really does get better.  You get back those human emotions you've been so deprived of, which sounds horrible but is so much more of a gift than you can imagine.  I wish you the best of luck bro."

quittingkratom,fopmio9,t3_g8pvxg,1587965539.0,"It's hell but 100% worth it.  The first few days ime are borderline unbearable levels of depression, anxiety, and physical pain and insomnia, but after a few days, you begin to realize the value of the new human emotions you can feel and that provides the motivation to continue the rest of the way.  It's even better if you're able to taper.  That motivation however won't necessarily persist through PAWs, which as a result is truly the hardest part of the process of sobriety.  Keep going strong bud.  You got this.  Remember why you're doing this for the next few years, especially the first 6mo-1y when you can experience PAWs.  You'll never be truly out in the clear and the memory of the euphoria and ""relief"" kratom brought will be in the back of your mind for the rest of your life.  But if you go in prepared, it won't matter."
