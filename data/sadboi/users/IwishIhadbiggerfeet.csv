In my experience, different skin related issues call for different amounts of turmeric. So you kind of just have to experiment. I also have a feeling that it builds up in your system over time (so it becomes more effective the longer and more often you take it), but I have nothing but anecdotal proof of this.

AskReddit,fq8983t,t1_fq86v7t,1589161073.0,"> We don't care how worms reproduce but we still study it.

Maybe YOU don't care, but some people are really fascinated by worm biology. Often studying one species will give us insight into other species (especially species with longer life-spans, harder to keep captive, difficult to reproduce etc.). Hell worms are important in crop growing, why wouldn't people study them?

&#x200B;

>How can a planet wage war on anything other than itself and still focus on space travel?

A species that has been visited by other space traveling, intelligent life forms that aren't originally from their planet (so alien to the war waging aliens in question). This would:  1) give them the knowledge that other species exist off their planet (making them want to attack and destroy them), 2) space travel is possible, and 3) example technology (ie how to travel). 

How could it do both? Simple. The planet could only have one species left on it. 

&#x200B;

> They don't have plants? Fine. They don't need c02. Maybe it's toxic to them but they don't care so they die immediately? That makes them kinda dumb not to study it.

Who said anything about the species having to have any kind of reaction to carbon dioxide besides you? They could have zero reaction to CO2. Also not studying something doesn't inherently mean they aren't capable of studying it. They could just lack the interest. You're humanizing the aliens too much. These aliens don't have the same inherent curiosity about the world that humans do.

First, I'm just trying to explain that an alien species that has never had the need or innate curiosity to study biology will simply not have the same understanding of biology that we do. Why is that hard for you to imagine?

Second, I'm assuming that a war waging species will only attack those who aren't in their species. Excuse me for not making that clear.

> Plants have a biology but people don't? Go back to first grade

My argument is sound. A planet with no plants will not have an intelligent species that understand botany. Why would they?

> Also you don't understand photosynthesis so first grade again.

I'm just making wild guesses. Thats the using your imagination part. A species that lives off of light and doesn't need water could indeed exist. Space travel would be easier for a being that doesn't need to consume other life forms to live."

Our science has been driven not only by our innate curiosity but also by evolutionary pressures. Like why did we develop vaccines? Well, we were exposed to viruses. Imagine an alien society that has never been exposed to viruses, why would they have any knowledge of vaccines? Hell, what if they didn't have the same immune system that we have? Vaccines wouldn't even work on them. They wouldn't have nor need the understanding of immunology that we have.

Consider again an alien species that is only driven by war and conquering. 
 Maybe they have never been exposed to microscopic pathogens, maybe they don't have our innate curiosity of nature, but hell do they get a rush from destroying other living creatures. They could focus all their efforts on engineering. Why would they study biology?  They only care about building machines, conquering other planets, and killing others. There is an evolutionary pull for that kind of species to spread. 

How about an alien species that comes from a planet with no plants? What would they know about botany?  Or a species that isn't made of cells? Why would they understand cellular biology?

A species that photosynthesizes, doesn't breath oxygen, and doesn't need water won't have the same limitations of space traveling that we would. Space traveling would simply be easier for them.
