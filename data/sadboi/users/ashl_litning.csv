vulvodynia,ffao1vd,t3_eskktk,1579740472.0,"So I don't know about the vulvoscopy but - not to freak you out - I had a real bad experience with my vulvar biopsy. But I feel like you'd rather know ahead of time, and it might have just been me being real sensitive, so you could be totally fine. My doctor at the time also didn't know about vulvodynia either, so an expert in the field could totally have a better way of doing it for you.

 It was right at the beginning of my angry-vagina-hates-me-journey, and I had a punch biopsy (I've heard other types aren't so bad) after not being able to figure out why I had this burning, painful feeling. 

First, yes, they numbed me, but the needle hurt like a bitch. Then I felt a pinch of the biopsy and after they got that, they cauterized the wound, which yeah, obviously burned because the numbing was wearing off. Then they gave me a pad to wear, because they said I might bleed for a little bit and sent me home.

Driving was hell, sitting was hell. I took as many painkillers as I could and just laid down in a cold bath for hours and cried. The pain was comparable to like a UTI at its very worst but just constant and in a different place. Peeing burned like a mother, so I got a portable bidet from Amazon and sprayed it while I went. The stress of it all just made the vulvodynia flare up even worse for a while after.

Again, I don't know if I just had an idiot for a doctor. Maybe mine was super incompetent and royally screwed me over. But they also made it out to be no big deal, maybe not knowing how sensitive my vagina was. It sucked, and I wish they had actually prepared me for the whole thing.

I really hope some other women have stories about it being no big deal!"

They laid out medicine and physical therapy options, as well as little things I could do like no caffeine, using a portable bidet, cotton underwear and all hypoallergenic soaps, detergents, etc. 

I’m not on anything now because I only have little flare ups every now and then, but I did a combo of gabapentin and numbing cream, plus the little things mentioned above, and a couple months of skirts with no underwear, just like leggings or tights :) 

It sucked for a while but by a few months post dermatologist I was like 85% pain free. Flare ups now are short and/or minor, not life-disrupting like before.

However, if you really can't afford Squarespace, I recommend Weebly. It's more limited as far as customization, but that means it's harder to mess up. Wix will let you do whatever, to your own detriment. For a simple author site, you don't need that.

No matter where you go though, it isn't possible to have someone buy a book from your site and receive it from Amazon/Ingram. Your options are either A) have a webstore and stock the book and ship it yourself (only really making profit if you order in bulk and sell a decent amount), OR B) link to Amazon to purchase.

I don’t want to like scare you off from the biopsy, but I got a punch biopsy early on and, aside from hurting like a bitch, it came back as completely normal, no help at all. It actually really made my pain kick up several notches for a decent while after that too. I mean, trust your doctor, but if it’s vulvodynia/vestibulitus, the biopsy won’t be able to confirm it, only rule other things out.  If you do get it, I advise some real good painkillers, ice packs, and cold baths.

In the end, what worked for me was googling my ass off until I found a dermatologist near me that specialized in vulvodynia, who immediately knew what was wrong  and could help me fix my pain fast. She actually got it, and it was so refreshing it made me cry.

What I did was a combo of wearing skirts and dresses with loose cotton underwear to keep things aired out, got all hypoallergenic products (shampoo, detergent, anything that could irritate me), started using a portable bidet (I have a fridababy fridet), and eliminated caffeine entirely. Stress also plays a big part in flare-ups for me. 

My doctor also offered me gabapentin (though I didn’t end up taking them), and a topical analgesic gel for when things got bad. That numbing stuff saved my life on bad days.
