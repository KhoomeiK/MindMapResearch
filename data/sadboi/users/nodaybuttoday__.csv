Most people who really stand for social justice that has evolved beyond the Tumblr teen variety do not support silencing, or outing people without their consent, etc. But at the same time, it is important not to tolerate intolerance. 

I was referring to most of the time when non-marginalized people ask for an education in things and demand it in really problematic ways that ultimately ask marginalized folks to re-live trauma in order to give them an education or insight. That's beyond the scope of having a healthy debate, it's demanding labor from one person and refusing to do any of the work while the marginalized person bends over backwards to ""help"" them understand--usually having to do with that person's experience of marginalization (a trauma) that they, the privileged person, can just forget all about and have the privilege of never addressing again because they don't live it."

queer,fps3mep,t3_gf2ndx,1588866901.0,"First things first, masculinity has nothing to do with your sexuality. Plenty of men are masculine and still gay. This shit is a spectrum. Honor who you are and that you can absolutely be several things at once. 

Second, generational ignorance isn't an excuse for hatefulness and bigotry. Don't give your father that much of an out; if you're his son, that love should be unconditional, period. Him policing your masculinity is a reflection of his own insecurity and is really, really unhealthy. But that's not your shit--it's his. 

Third, get a person in your life who you do trust to talk to about this and maybe have them read this post as a way in; it prevents you from having to say much, since you already did. That person can be a friend, family, but I would recommend someone who was detached from your family to start, because if you're not ready for it to spill over into your parents, I'd try a degree of separation. Is your mother a safe person to talk to about it? Hm. 

Fourth, get yourself some LGBTQIA+ friends. Like, guy friends who are gay who know exactly what it is you're going through. They will, guaranteed, make you feel less alone, and likely will also give you a reality check if you decide to become sexually active. A lot of queer people, while they are closeted, take huge sexual risks and lack hindsight because you're still trying to figure shit out and might not see the forest for the trees with respect to everyone you hook up with. Find a positive gay network of guys who are out, living their best life, and who can guide and love you through it. Seeing them as role models will definitely help your self-esteem and make you more comfortable with who you are. Follow gay men and LGBTQIA people on social media. Normalize it. Text them, hang out with them, as much as you can. 

Coming out often happens in layers. But first, you have to come out to yourself. Then, a trusted person. Then, friends, then select members of your family. Save the toughest people for last and don't over prepare. But that's too far down the road. One step at a time for now. And I am here if there is ANYTHING you need. I myself am queer (female) and have two gay brothers, and the process has been different for all of us, but generally the threads are the same. Sending you love."

EatingDisorders,fo76bo8,t1_fo5ziyw,1587573006.0,"Yep! It's disgraceful, dishonest and honestly, encourages eating disorders, along with vanity sizing and the movement of the BMI scale to falsely alarm people about ob\*sity in the mid 1990s.
