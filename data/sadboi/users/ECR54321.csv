BorderlinePDisorder,ff9b97u,t3_esc7wz,1579709024.0,I‚Äôve been in DBT classes now for about 8 months and my psychologist always recommends that I ‚Äúcheck the facts‚Äù meaning do my emotions really equal to what‚Äôs going on or am I being too emotional about the situation. I always tend to be more emotional minded instead of rational minded so now in situations I ask myself are my emotions really equal to what‚Äôs going on in that situation at that time. Hope all that made sense.
