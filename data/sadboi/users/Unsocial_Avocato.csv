depression,fpmq6fx,t1_fpmotvx,1588738869.0,Well I did that. I asked her if there was something wrong and why she wasn't talking as much as before. She said in turn that she's busy. Although I know she Video calls her other friends and scrolls through the instagram feed regularly (I know because of the posts she likes) all the while ignoring my texts and not picking up my calls.
depression,fpmohy1,t3_gea6mo,1588737695.0,Same man. The worst thing is that as of recently I used to have someone who would call me  (16M) her (16F) bestfriend.

I guess the word best friend has no special value for her. It's just a word :(
