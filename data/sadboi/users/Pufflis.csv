aww,fgm6hsf,t1_fglrmhe,1580918869.0,"I know you made it up, because the truth is even cooler. We actually used to have a military base for training seals to find enemy mines and submarines. The base gained some attention after we had to buy thousands of litres of milk to feed them. The idea worked out really well and the seals localised their target roughly 90% of the time. However, on their first mission where they had to save 33 men in a sinking submarine, the seals were placed 1 km too far away, and since they only have a search radius of 300 metres, they found the submarine a few minutes too late. The project was then scrapped and the seals retired.
