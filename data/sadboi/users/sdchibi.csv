As a renter, there's only so much I can do about it. Some people have made good suggestions here that I might try for myself, though. 

One thing that has helped (but not completely solved) my situation is to use blackout curtains over all the windows once the temps get into the 60s on a regular basis. They're not as pretty but they do help. I also open a window on opposite ends of the apartment and put a fan in front of each them to encourage a stronger cross-breeze."

I'm in NY and my rabbits are indoor only (I don't have a yard) so there's not much worry about myxo or rhd here, thankfully. Plus she didn't have any nasal or eye discharge, no wet chin, front paws were clean and dry. She was prone to stasis but she was still nibbling food, had gut sounds when I listened and she was interested in her favorite foods but seemed like she couldn't eat more than a couple bites, like maybe she felt full too fast. I'm thinking it may have been something that took up space in her chest cavity like a thymoma or perhaps heart failure. She was a dwarf rabbit, less than 3 lbs, so maybe she didn't have a lot of extra space to start with.

Unfortunately, she died while I was trying to get her into the carrier to go to the emergency vet because it was a Friday after 5pm. She got panicked and I couldn't calm her down, she flopped over, convulsed a couple times and that was it. I had to put her body in the freezer until I could bring her to our regular vet. Too late for necropsy. 

The other rabbits didn't have a lot of contact with her (she hated other bunnies!) and they all seem fine. I made an appt to have them checked out but the vet cancelled all of their appts except for emergency because of the lockdown.

Setting smaller goals and then making a decision on where to set the next goal if I'm still feeling good has helped me to get more things done and has reduced my general anxiety. YMMV but I hope it helps.
mentalhealth,fk1te31,t3_ffz9r0,1583786487.0,"FWIW, I think the teachers are likely in the same boat. This has thrown them off their lesson plans and they may be more forgiving or more inclined to review the previous lessons. I work in a college in NY and the faculty are a bit nervous about how a 2-4 week closure would affect graduations in May, so that's what I'm basing this on. It may well be a different attitude where you are.

Hope you stay well and try not to worry too much. Just do the best you can. It's really all we can do in these situations."
ADHD,fjoa5jq,t3_fedpyf,1583523657.0,"That happens to me sometimes, as well. For me, it's anxiety rather than defiance. Even if I wanted to get something done, if someone else asks me to get that same thing done, my anxiety increases because it makes me feel like I'll let them down or I'll be judged negatively if I don't get it done. Anxiety exhausts me when there's too much of it and I lose the energy to focus and complete the task because the anxiety has used up my energy."
mentalhealth,fjnxjfo,t3_fedv1q,1583516323.0,"I'm sorry for what you've gone through and what you're still going through. It's not unusual to for victims of sexual assault to experience emotional blunting, if that's any consolation. It can happen as a defense mechanism (subconsciously) in people who have experienced some type of trauma or prolonged depression. The idea is that your mind wants to protect you from feeling bad so if you're emotions are making you feel bad most of the time your mind is putting up walls to keep you from feeling those emotions. Unfortunately, the mind can overshoot with this defensive mechanism and keep you from feeling the pleasant emotions, too. You're right about seeking out therapy; I think it would be really helpful for you. Best wishes."

work,fjhpxab,t3_fdg25j,1583352883.0,"If they are trying to get rid of you (and it honestly sounds like they are making a paper trail to do that) it's probably because they either don't want to pay the kind of wages for your 6 years of experience or don't want to pay for the benefits associated with long-term employment (some employees become eligible for long-term disability or max out their sick leave between 5-10 years of employment in some companies). They're thinking they could save some money by hiring someone new, pay them less per hour and give them fewer benefits. Probably.

If it's any consolation, I don't think you'll have any trouble getting a CNA position elsewhere if you'd rather not fight but if you've been a CNA for 6 years I think you have it in you to fight and possibly win. CNAs are some of the toughest people there are. Good luck to you!"
mentalhealth,fjamq9y,t3_fcebdf,1583176528.0,"I don't mind sharing but I just want to emphasize that I can only speak for myself and what I have experienced. If it doesn't match up to your experience that doesn't mean anything other than different people experience similar things in different ways sometimes. 

I've gotten the ""dreamworld"" feeling occasionally during times of great emotional distress. Specifically, when my brother died and I had to break the news to everyone else. I felt like I was playing a role in a movie or like a robot that was programmed to perform certain tasks. None of it felt real and I certainly didn't want it to be real and I really struggled with accepting it. Sometimes I still do.

I've felt disconnected from reality during panic attacks, also, but the feeling goes away with the panic attack so while it can be a little scary in the moment it doesn't last too long thankfully.

You mentioned feeling like ""you don't mean to other people what they mean to you"". I do feel like that occasionally but it hasn't been at the same time as the ""dreamworld"" feeling. I have been ghosted by someone I considered a good friend and it's made me a little more nervous in friendships now. When that thought comes up I tend to examine it (I don't know if that's healthy or not, btw) to figure out why that would be the case. Have I been cancelling plans with friends? Have they been cancelling with me? What else is going on in their lives that might be distracting them from maintaining friendships? Have I been isolating myself? If so, why? The answer (for me) is usually that my depression has flared-up or that my friend is going through something that has nothing to do with me.

All the best to you. Hope you feel better soon."

I've gotten stranded by CDTA a couple of times because they don't come up Stowe when it snows and I didn't have the physical ability to walk the hill to get home. The #85 is really weird schedule and skips my whole neighborhood on every other run.

I'll definitely do more research on the bus routes when I move but it's not a reliable option if I ditch my car and stay where I am."

work,fiaaw9b,t3_f76jdd,1582297150.0,"It's hard to deal with the general public. Sorry you had to put up with such awful behavior. 

People that act the way she did usually are living a miserable life in one way or another and taking it out on those in a service type of job is only way they get to feel powerful or in control. It's absolutely wrong of them to act out like that but I can't help but pity them.

Please know that people mostly behave as they do because of whatever is going on in their lives and in their heads. It has very little to do with you and I suspect that nothing you could've done would've made this person happy."
mentalhealth,fi4oxp1,t1_fi2tbxh,1582145551.0,"Make a new thread for this so that more people on here see it and can answer. 

For my part, I will say that it's really hard to convince someone else that they need help. I think if you can explain to her how therapy and medication have helped you (maybe use examples of how it's helped?) and how you think it could help her (again, be specific) she might see it in a different way and be more open to it. Forgive me for assuming that you haven't tried that yet. It's the only thing I can think of that might work. Hopefully there are others here that have more knowledge about it that can steer you in the right direction."
ADHD,fi0wztl,t3_f5r2x1,1582046451.0,"I experience this, also. I think it has something to do with how I experience time, which (for me) breaks into only 2 times: Now and Not-Now

For example: I have an appointment at 10am but the time is currently 7am. That means that the appointment is Not-Now but because it's an important appointment that I don't want to miss I develop anxiety to keep that 10am appointment in forefront of my mind so that I don't ""get lost in the Now"" and miss my appointment. That leads to me being very much unproductive until the appointment happens. Sometimes, I wear myself out with the anxiety, lose focus,and still miss the appointment (no matter how much I intended to keep it) and that leads to more anxiety on my part.

Setting alarms on my phone has helped me immensely with that problem. I set an alarm for when I need to stop what I'm currently doing and get ready to leave and then another alarm for when I absolutely must walk out that door to get there on time. That way, I can do whatever I need to do in the Now and feel secure in knowing that the alarm will tell me when I need to shift gear instead of relying on anxiety-fueled focus that exhausts me and doesn't let me get anything else done."
