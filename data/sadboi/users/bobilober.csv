More recently I followed a girl on Instagram who liked frogs and now frogs are my favorite animal, and another girl who liked Harley Quinn and now she's my favorite character. I'm always so unsure of myself that whenever I find a character that I relate to I cling on to them as a way to represent myself and with real people if I like them a lot I basically try to be like them"

My suggestion is take some time to think and reflect, and see if there's something you have had a continuous passion for, no matter what that might be.
