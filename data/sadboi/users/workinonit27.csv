LifeAfterNarcissism,fk60b7u,t3_fgkmp4,1583891204.0,"Yup! My ndad really wanted a son, but he got 4 girls first and was very vocal about how awful it was. All of my sister's and i tried as hard as we could in different ways to be sons instead of daughters. We did 'boy chores' like mowing the lawn (we were too dumb to be taught how to change a tire tho), we tried asking for 'boy toys' like army men and action figures instead of things we actually wanted for Christmases and birthdays, we shopped in the boys section, we tried to get into shooting/hunting with him but were never allowed bc we were girls. Then he got a son and ignored us and focused all his narcissistic shit onto him. He's now a teenage wreck still in the thick of it."

Mine tried to tell me i had slowly trained my brain to have ""headaches every day"" and my condition was basically my fault bc i told him i started out only having 1 every few months and they've slowly become more frequent over the years until now i have them every day. Before he heard anything about what treatments i had tried so far."

That resentment is real tho."

Parenting,eqa1u2p,t3_bxnayl,1559923151.0,Your wife definitely needs to see somebody. Other comments have said enough about her but i came here to say that It probably wouldn't hurt to address your sons understanding of hurting people and death with a professional as well. He needs to be taught what are appropriate things to do when he's angry.

My only advice is therapy helps. I know how bad this sucks, you're not alone!"
Parenting,eps3ffo,t3_bvoqj0,1559436605.0,My 6yo was just diagnosed with adhd and is so hyperactive sms impulsive he can be violent too but so far (only 3 days) meds have been helping him . I understand the struggle. Also just found r/PARENTSofADHD maybe they'll be able to help a little. I wish you luck!
ADHD,epqciqw,t1_epp7u87,1559403494.0,I definitely don't want him to feel any shame for who he is or how his brain works. I just meant i don't want him to learn to say he can't just to get our of difficult things without trying. I can definitely see how there can be a pretty fine line between the two and it totally makes me nervous.  I try really hard to acknowledge and praise effort i can see and talk to him before assuming there isn't effort just because i can't see it. This can be tricky sometimes tho so thank you for the reminder!
ADHD,epqbr54,t1_epp7jsp,1559403120.0,Ok this paints a picture i think i can really understand bc while i didn't have adhd my dad is a narcissist and i know exactly how those car rides feel. Putting it all in this context really drives it home for me and makes discussing the *why* while making sure not to shame him feel so important. Thank you!
ADHD,epp0pvg,t1_epnqklh,1559359733.0,"Asking why instead of jumping to conclusions is a reminder i really appreciate! I love the idea of letting him work I his own groove and taking advantage of the hyperfocus too. It canbe a struggle for me not to assume he's freeing to get out of things on purpose when (as i usually lathe realize) he just got distracted and feel into that hyperfocus. 
I am however a mama bear when it comes to those hurtful, cutting comments. My parents used to say things about how he was crazy or call him the Tasmanian devil (not kindly or playfully), or insult my parenting all the time bc he had 5Ã— the energy of all the other kids in our extend family (his age or not) and that hurt me. I can't imagine how he would feel if he heard things like that from his family. 
Thank you so much for your comment!"
ADHD,epp050b,t1_epnzp7e,1559359181.0,I admit i am struggling to be consistent with routines now that it's summer and we don't have the structure of school anymore but this was an excellent reminder to keep pushing with that. I will say tho that i feel like we are really good at positive reinforcement (i learned real fast that negative reinforcement makes everything worse). He is such a good kid! And so incredibly creative sometimes i wonder how so many things come out of his little mind so fast! I just worry that i won't know how to help him develop his differently wired brain bc my brain works nothing like his.
ADHD,epozn1z,t1_epnz1jx,1559358706.0,Your parents are goals!
ADHD,epozhpg,t1_epoc4k5,1559358562.0,"We are being really careful with the meds bc we dont want him to become too dependant on them but i could tell kindergarten this last year was difficult for him. He kept up ok but it took everything he had. So definitely starting with the lowest dose and watching carefully. 
It was funny to me when you said you occasionally medicate with caffeine bc i had never thought of it that way but over the last few years we have definitely done that, usually giving him small amounts of caffeinated soda when he was really out of control. I never quite understood why it helped until recently and for so long i thought it was some quirky/unique thing about him that i had stumbled on haha"
ADHD,epoybo9,t1_epouah3,1559357452.0,We try to be as open as we can about pretty much everything. He knows he has adhd and for now all he really understands about that is that he has a brain like dad's. Beyond that he doesn't seem to care much lol but i think he likes identifying with his dad in that way.
ADHD,epoy4zw,t1_epoqqgr,1559357280.0,I'm so sorry to hear about your struggles! I wish you luck in finding solutions that fit your family!
ADHD,epoy1j5,t1_epov6g9,1559357191.0,My husband and i were both also raised in a very strict shame-based religion and we are specifically not raising our kids in any religion bc we don't want to risk excluding them to any of that shame! It was horrible for me and i can't imagine going through that with an adhd brain. We're also pretty up front with him about his diagnosis. I'm sorry all this put such a strain on your relationship with your parents though and i hope you are all able to find ways to repair them.
ADHD,epkhvyi,t3_buynyd,1559274677.0,"Extreme hyperactivity, impulsivity, very short attention span in comparison to other kids his age, and huge emotional meltdowns were our biggest hints. This kid would never. Hold. Still. Even in front of tv or video games he would wiggle his legs/feet or sit and bounce on a yoga ball the entire time. We've been literally chasing him since he was old enough to crawl."

AskReddit,ep8gnqi,t1_ep87mqo,1559094678.0,"This is actually my biggest fear. I am in therapy for my anxiety/ptsd and my 6yo son is in a behavioral therapy (and being evaluated for adhd and odd) for angry outbursts. I'm so afraid that I've already passed my shit down to him or that he really doesn't need the therapy and I'm giving him complexes or something by putting him in for my issues.

But i guess the point is that we're doing what we can now to help ourselves and our kids right?"
Parenting,eoxmhpl,t1_eox2npb,1558926025.0,This is prefect. Unless you suspect something like adhd (something we suspect in our loud and overly active 6yo) then outlets for our all might be all she needs as she learns the social ropes and compassion seems like something very active kids especially need emphasis on imo.
