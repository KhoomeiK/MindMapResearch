sugarlifestyleforum,fqc6jmp,t3_gi0dwn,1589251163.0,"I feel the same way. Sugaring has been part of my life off and on for the last 3-4 years. This quarantine has made me realize that I'm comfortable mentally, physically, and financially without an SD. 

I'm grateful for all the people and lessons I've learned along the way but it's time I pursue a steady vanilla relationship. Took down my SA profile and it already feels like a fresh start.

I hope you are able to find what you're looking for, OP!"

Like u/HighlordDario said, many viewers will watch and post timestamps in the comments. I've noticed this is more common for popular ASMRtists (like Gentle Whispering, WhispersRed, Latte ASMR) than lesser-known ones."

depression,fizoo7v,t3_fajhs4,1582868982.0,"You're definitely not alone in feeling that way, OP. I struggle with this as well. Despite knowing that most of social media is just everybody's ""highlight reel"", it can really put me in a dark place. Hard not to feel inadequate when you're constantly seeing photos of beautiful, fit Instagram models (seriously, where do they find these people?!) getting engaged, landing a great career, and traveling the world.

Reminds me of one of my favorite quotes: ""Comparison is the thief of joy."" Couldn't be more true."

Unfortunately, there's no cure but I've found that light physical exfoliation + CeraVe SA lotion has smoothed them out considerably."

On an unrelated note, I have those same bumps on my arms. Always wondered if a tattoo would kind of cover them up and it looks like it does. Win-win."
