AmItheAsshole,fq6ogvf,t3_ggtxt0,1589135468.0,"NAH, hear me out. You're not upset when she mentions that she's bi. You're upset when she acts like you aren't good enough for her, and that's fully understandable.

Bi woman here. My best friend is also a bi woman in a relationship with a guy. She often wonders what it's like to have intercourse with a woman and sometimes she comments on it. She's openly attracted to women. It has indeed accidentally hurt her bf's feelings in the past, but now they have peace because they cleared it up, and she toned it down. Since they're both bi and in a serious relationship, their agreement is that if one of them seriously wanted to experience just once with the other gender to satiate the curiosity before marriage, as long as they had permission, it was okay. That's just them though, their special agreement because they have that kind of bond. My boyfriend and I bond over how much we like boobs, what we like in girls, but that's about it. 

So I think that it's not unusual that she's curious about dudes because I've seen the other way around, from someone who is very committed to her relationship, and I'm not sure it's from malicious intent. If she's been obnoxious and insensitive about it, that's definitely an issue. She may be bi but she chose to settle with a woman. Her attraction to dudes shouldn't get in the way of the love she has for you. My best friend and I, if we had to choose between hooking up with the other gender or staying with our boyfriends, we'd choose our boyfriends, no question.

So I know what I'm gonna say sucks, because I hate it when someone tells me that, but I think you guys need to communicate better. She needs to understand that this is making you uncomfortable. Not her bisexuality, but the way her comments about wishing something that you can't provide, makes you feel discouraged about pleasing her and as if you aren't good enough. If she makes it about her sexuality, maybe compare it to body types or kinks. If she liked Double D big boobs and you're average but she openly drooled about double d's all the time, it would naturally hurt your feelings. She can't help liking double d's but she *can* help the way she goes about it. She can tone it down and she can communicate it better. Be understanding but she needs to be understanding too. Knowing your worth isn't biphobic, don't settle for less, ok?

Tl;Dr: being curious is normal, being insensitive is not. She may not be doing it on purpose. Heart-to-heart conversation is suggested"

Couple months ago during his trading course some idiot he was stationed with disappeared during everyone's night off. Most people had gone to drink and were back on time, but not him. My bf was supposed to make sure everyone had gotten back but he figured he just missed him and went to bed. 

Angry knock on his door at 4AM. Superior yelling at him to get up. They found the guy- pissed drunk. Literally pissed drunk- he peed on some firearms that were lined up outside. When my bf had to drag him to the Chief Warrant Officer/Commissioned officer (or some superior like that) as he could barely stand up. While drunk dude was getting yelled at.... he threw up. In his superior's office. All over himself. Everyone got yelled at to just wash him and put him to bed. BF and his mates had to strip him shirtless, forcibly shower him (he was drunkenly yelling and trying to fight everyone), forcibly dry him, forcibly put him in PJs and forcibly put him to bed.

He woke up with a huge hangover without a single clue what had happened. He allegedly went very, very pale when he was told. Legend has it he's still catching up on extra duty

They're drawn to lower energies and open energy centres. The more you open up or feed into them, the deeper they're anchored. The more they're anchored, the more they bring you down. Making you feel confused, lonely, fatigued, depressed, paranoid, like nothing matters, like the world is against you, like you actually deserve this and no one really likes you. And eventually, suicidal. They're tricksters and will try to distort your sense of self to isolate you and feed off your misery. I can usually tell because I'm being attacked by one because I'll suddenly feel horribly drained and miserable. I'll feel a cold chill egging me to give in. Like covert Dementors. Once you start fighting back, they won't take it kindly.

You gotta ground yourself and put your foot down. Know your worth. Tell them that you are no longer affiliated and that they *will* leave now. That you are your own master. Shield yourself (obsidian, sage, runes, spell jar, nazars, whatever floats your boat) as best you can, especially your solar plexus, cord-cut and ward the place, until you feel a weight lifting off your shoulders. Be polite but be unequivocal, no matter what. Sometimes it takes time. Bath and chanting are also good! Chanting is personally my most powerful tool. 

Usually, if you're confused about said deity/entity's legitimacy, don't risk it. Stay grounded and shielded and close anything you've opened. Be clear, at all times, on your intent (I always add ""should it be solely in the name of my own divine good""). Cleanse your space and yourself often. Practice good emotional hygiene (negativity attracts negative entities). Black tourmaline, selenite, obsidian and lapis lazuli are good protectors. Basically, good spiritual hygiene makes you less likely to get a spiritual virus"

When we were in high school, he was socially awkward, laughed at the wrong times, tripped on thin air and went into huge never-ending speeches on his favourite geeky obsessions that would crush any attempts at a normal conversation. Bit of a loner but as sweet as it gets, wouldn't hurt a fly. He asked me out, shaking with terror, but I gently turned him down because I wasn't interested (he took it well). We still went to prom as friends.

Fast forward two years, I run into him again. One year into the military. He smiles more, his back is straighter and more relaxed, he jumps in the conversations and makes the room laugh. His stories are usually entertaining and he's a good listener. When a friend wronged us, he leashed onto them the most spectacular flow of insults I never would've had the balls to say. When I flipped him off as a joke, I took it back and said ""here, I'm unfucking you."" He laughed. ""Pfff. Honey, you would've had to fuck me in the first place if you wanted to unfuck this boy right here and that ain't happened so goooood fuckin' luck"". I was like *is this the same guy??* He checked on every day me when he saw I was in a bad place before we dated. He still has his hobby obsessions but once a after being particularly intense he called me and asked ""I'm talking too much about it.... right? I've been having this feeling"" and he's a lot more chill since. He also got that military bod now lol.

- they notice how you're doing, it's not one-sided. There was something my bf was doing that I didn't like and I had reflexively bottled it up to avoid a fight. He called me, admitted that it looked like I didn't appreciate, apologized and stopped it and I didn't have to say a thing! It happened two or three times before I stopped thinking he was psychic and instead realized he just proactively cared about my well-being the same way I did for his

- they're sensitive to your emotions. I was so confused when my bf started crying when I was crying. However, when it happens, you don't feel worse or guilty or stressed. You feel validated. I don't feel as guilty or responsible for them all the time.

- it feels boring. To the point where you feel something is about to explode at any time. But no, it's actually supposed to be boring. And that needs getting used to. We're unfortunately addicted to something stronger. Genuinely addicted. 

- you're not walking on eggshells to ""protect"" yourself or them. You shouldn't have to feel that way. 

- You both are more independent. Your life won't revolve around their unique personality and grandiose problems and they won't revolve around you. 

- your unhealthy coping mechanisms like stonewalling for attention won't work. It won't give you this temporary satisfaction as much. Toxicity thrives in toxicity, and narcs enable you. In a healthy relationship, it will just create more problems and it will overall lose its appeal... Because you don't need those mechanisms as much. You end up adapting and overall improving a lot

It was my online friend's narcissistic, bigoted jock ex who works at Starbucks who had tried to rape her to prove he was straight after a failed tentative relationship with a dude. He's bisexual like me, much against his will. I publicly ended my reply with:

""Go suck a Venti dick Ã  la whipped cream. I hear it's Starbuck's new Pride special. Don't worry, it's 100% consensual :)"" 

""Suck a dick? Jokes on you, I'm straight.""

""Jokes on *you*, your ex-boyfriend confirmed you're a fucking whiny bottom"""

AskReddit,fp6fore,t3_gbiyx8,1588351543.0,"First and only time I had sleep paralysis during a thunderstorm. I casually believe in past lives... but that was fucking crazy. Can't make it up.

I dreamt I was in a home, mid 1800s to early 1900s. My home, and I was married. My husband was alcoholic, and he was never home, he was cold and uncaring. My chest was just bleeding of bitterness and jealousy and regret. I was consumed with resentment. A familiar feeling, as I have only one, shitty high school ex I've held a vicious grudge against.

*crack, boom*. Lightening. Suddenly I'm in my bed, in 2019, unable to move as the house shakes from the storm. An invisible pressure on my chest, as if an old hag was sitting on it. ""Confront the past,"" it hissed. ""You have to let it go."" I'm plunged back. I see a luggage- I had travelled grey-skied Venice. I'm walking at night near a bridge, in a pretty dress, ruminating how miserable I was. The bitterness is crushing my chest. ""You have to forgive!"" Lightning strikes again and I'm back in my bed, the old hag sitting on me. ""You brought your resentment here. You brought it back here and it'll keep coming back when you try to love until you let it go. You have to forgive."" ""I don't want to."" ""You don't have a choice."" A glass of whiskey, a back turned to me, an office desk and a tall window. A tentative look in a hallway mirror- my eyes are look so tired and angry. I was so young but so old. The pressure in my chest keeps building as images I can't remember now flash. I'm in my bed yet not at the same time. I cave in when the pressure makes it I can't breathe. Everything I've been containing inside explodes. ""Alright! Okay! I forgive him! I forgive him! I let it go!"" ""Good."" The pressure lifts. I exhale, the resentment gone.

*CRAAAACK boom.* I'm awake in my bed, alone, clutching my chest. The storm is raging. I'm 3 seconds away from peeing myself. The tirade dured what felt like hours"
