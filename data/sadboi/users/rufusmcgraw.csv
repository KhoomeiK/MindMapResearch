exAdventist,fnnjwzv,t3_g2l5ao,1587094109.0,"My experience in the Adventist church is kind of odd, actually. My parents aren't and never have been Adventist. They're Christian, not particularly strict ones but we were pretty involved with our church, service every Sunday along with youth group and Bible study several nights a week. Anyway, my parents really wanted me to go to a Christian school and pretty much the only options in my hometown were the SDA Academy, or Catholic school. My dad went to Catholic school and hated it, so SDA Academy it was.

I stayed in Adventist school from 1st - 12th grade (aside from two years in public school, long boring story). It was really.....well, odd. As a little kid I thought that at least since I was Christian, we all had that in common, but nope. The adults often treated me like a bad influence and trouble maker cause I went to church on *gasp* Sunday and read Harry Potter. I could talk about my experience for a long time, but yeah, in short, it was weird. Even though my family wasn't Adventist I still basically ""grew up"" in the SDA church since school took up most of every day and all my friends were Adventist. I wasn't part of the religion, but I was part of the community. And I was required to attend a LOT of church events via school.

But yeah, it was a real weird upbringing. I was too ""secular"" for the Adventists and too Christian for any other kids, as a result felt really out of place among everyone. I'm not religious anymore at all but I still feel permanently Weird because of it."

Also you might already know this, but for future reference: companies like H&R Block and TurboTax are legally required to provide free filing for people who earn under a certain amount - this year it was $69,000. These companies make it almost impossible to find (TurboTax's free file option is not accessible from their main site, and has nothing to do with the totally separate product they offer called ""Free Edition"" that usually isn't actually free).  You can use [the IRS website](https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/jsp/wizard.jsp) to figure out which site is the best for you to use.

Sorry if none of that up there applies to you or you already knew that - it just makes me so mad that tax prep companies make it so difficult for people to find the actual free tax filing they're legally entitled to! It's so scummy."

If you look at a tax form you'll see there's a portion on the form where you fill in your DD info if you want to get your refund that way; and, like the rest of your taxes, TT just fills that part in for you. You can actually download your completed tax return forms on the TurboTax site to see this for yourself.

So long story short, if you gave TurboTax your DD info and especially if you've successfully received your tax return(s) in your bank account, then I'm 99.9% sure that yes, the IRS has your direct deposit info."

Yes, this! You phrased it so well.

But all that being said, I haven't felt this calm in SO long. So many people I know are talking about how their worlds have been shattered, they don't feel like themselves anymore, they've lost all sense of direction, they're stuck at home, they're anxious 24/7 etc and I so badly want to tell them ""welcome to the club.""

I keep thinking I'm ""better"" and then some stupid thing will trigger me and I'm back to weeping my brains out as if I'd never made any progress at all.

Stumbling on this sub was kind of a culture shock but it was what I needed. I needed someone to make me feel awful for supporting animal ag, because animal ag IS awful. 

When I finally did go vegan, I went through a period of intense grief over how much harm I'd been contributing to for my entire life. I was heartbroken and angry. I claimed to love animals, yet I had contributed to the torture of countless pigs, cows, chickens, etc. I can't believe it took me so long to align my actions with my morals. I really wish I had met some preachy vegans sooner - it would have been that much less time that I was causing harm. I experienced serious depression thinking about how even if I stay vegan the rest of my life, which I will, it can never undo all the animals who already suffered and died for my stupid momentary enjoyment.

birthcontrol,flgmc3f,t3_foknt7,1585145869.0,"I've never had an IUD, but I have had ovarian cysts and my symptoms very much mimicked what you described - a sharp pain that came and went a few times a week. For a while my cyst pain was so bad that if I was doing something like driving when it hit me, I had to pull over cause I couldn't focus on the road. I eventually got an ultrasound and that's when they found the cyst. As the other commenter up there said, if it is a cyst there's really nothing they can do unless it's ginormous. I never received any sort of treatment for it, it's more of a ""keep your eye on it"" situation.

I would say that unless the pain gets to be really intense and long-lasting, you probably don't want to brave the urgent care with everything going on right now. That being said, does your doctor's office have any kind of nurse hotline or anything so you can talk to an actual medical professional (which I am not) about your symptoms? My gut feeling is that you'll be okay but talking to a nurse might ease your worries about it.

All the bleeding was making me utterly exhausted all the time, which in turn made me depressed which in turn made me gain tons of weight (stress eating + less active since I was so tired), which made me *more* depressed. I was miserable on it. If it's making you miserable, take it out. I did and went back on the pill. I really miss the convenience and peace of mind from the Nexplanon, but I couldn't deal with the side effects anymore.

You need to do what's best for *you*, which ultimately only you can decide. But my advice is that if it's making you feel awful, then try something else. There's no shame in having to ""shop around"" for birth control. Everyone's body is different."

AskVegans,fjhn2is,t3_fdhl65,1583351309.0,"I also grew up in the SDA church so I feel you hard on everything you said there. I'm not able to watch the video right now so I can't speak to any of that, but I have other thoughts. In short, veganism is entirely about ethics for me, and like the other commenter here, I don't particularly care about the health claims. I mean, it's cool that it's healthy, but that's entirely a side benefit for me.

My impression is that, for people who *do* want to prove that a plant-based diet is healthy, it's convenient to point to the Seventh Day Adventists as an example of a large group that thrives without any meat in their diet. Honestly though, it really leaves a bad taste in my mouth when people link to those studies to support veganism - both because I don't like legitimizing the SDA church like that and also because Adventists are vegetarian, not vegan. (At least, the community I grew up in was vegetarian. We ate tons of eggs and dairy, cheese on absolutely everything. Maybe your experience was different.)

In short, I could buy that the Adventist church is pushing some studies promoting vegetarianism, but I think you'll find that the vast majority of vegans are not religious and those Adventist health studies have little to do with people's decisions to go vegan. And in fact, I don't think I know any Adventists who are actually vegan. Besides that, there are a lot of reasons to be vegan that have nothing to do with health, or with the teachings of the Adventist church. Veganism is an ethical stance to reduce the suffering of animals. The Adventists eat vegetarian/plant-based because of religious beliefs and health claims. I'd really encourage you to consider all the other reasons to be vegan and try to separate veganism from the SDA church. Watching the documentary Dominion on YouTube is a good place to start.

The WIC program specifies which items you can and can't buy - usually ""staple"" items like milk, eggs, infant formula, etc. If you look, you'll often notice at big supermarkets they have tags specifying items that are WIC qualifying. Personally I don't like how restrictive WIC is either.

Food stamps are just money given to you on a card, that can only be spent on food, at grocery stores. There are some general restrictions - no alcohol, no ""prepared""/hot food - but for the most part you can buy whatever you want with them. 

Depending on your income and circumstances you can potentially be on both WIC and food stamps. The post in question is about food stamps so I'm not sure why the commenter here is talking about WIC."

alienisolation,fajesfo,t1_fajepzh,1576134426.0,"Hmm, well you might not have found the blueprints for the medkit yet? I can't remember which mission you find that in."
alienisolation,faiok8k,t1_fai37q7,1576112873.0,"I believe you should be able to craft a medikit by now, provided you have all the components for one. Do you know how to craft things?"
alienisolation,faf9jh4,t1_faf8nxu,1576017479.0,"Seconded! When I first played this level my anxiety was through the roof. When he came down from the ceiling I sprinted (which I now know I shouldn't do) back into the room with the terminal and hid in a locker, waited til I worked up the courage to come out, took five steps out of the room then swore I saw/heard him again and ran back to hide in the locker. This cycle went on for like 45 minutes lol, I was terrified.

Getting through that mission is really rough, but once you're past it the alien really is just another obstacle to avoid. Which is not to say that the game stops being scary entirely, but eventually you'll stop being paralyzed with fear whenever the xeno is around. Promise. It also helps that you eventually acquire more tools for dealing with it, in that med bay mission you're totally helpless which makes it a lot scarier."

birthcontrol,f94uzdi,t3_e3hj26,1575104837.0,"I'm so sorry this happened to you! This happened to me when I had my Nexplanon removed as well; according to my doctor it was not only in too deep but also inserted at a ""weird"" angle and the tissue was heavily scarred over, so she couldn't get it out on her own. She ultimately had to call in a nurse to help her, they made a larger incision and dug around in my arm for a long time until they finally got it. I think I was in the exam room for at least an hour between all the different attempts at it. My guess is that your doctor will try it again with the help of another doctor or nurse before they send you to have general surgery.

I hope things go better for you next time! Best of luck, I know it's such a freaky feeling"
vegan,f6ptfzj,t3_dschrz,1573063890.0,"I just made some mashed potatoes last night, for the first time since going vegan, and they turned out amazing! Honestly it was really easy. Take some Yukon gold potatoes, cut 'em into quarters, boil until soft, drain, put them in a bowl. Add in some salt, vegan butter (the buttery sticks from [this](http://meltorganic.com/our-products/) brand are my favorite), and olive oil. Whip until smooth, tasting occasionally, adding salt and/or butter and/or oil to taste as you go. And once you're satisfied with the taste & texture, you're done!

You could sub the cream with a plant milk alternative if you really wanted to, but honestly I don't think you need it at all. If you have a hand mixer it's easy to just whip it to the right consistency. Mine came out soooooo creamy and buttery smooth.

Add some mushroom gravy to top it off. I tried to improvise some last night but it was kind of a fail, however there's tons of great recipes online and I'm pretty sure pre-made mushroom gravy is a thing you can buy, just be sure to check the ingredients for sneaky animal products."
