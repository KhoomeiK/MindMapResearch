RedDeadOnline,fmmwdk4,t1_fmmw6u6,1586213352.0,Iâ€™ll definitely try that!
RedDeadOnline,fmmnoqh,t1_fmmknyc,1586208628.0,"I move around a lot and tend to be out of sight until itâ€™s time for me to actually shoot my target. When somebody is after me I try not to run in a straight line or in a way where itâ€™d be easy to shoot me but it still on,y takes one shot."
RedDeadOnline,fmmnkxh,t1_fmmhbbp,1586208572.0,"Thank you for the advice! Iâ€™m not using any cards because I donâ€™t understand them. Also, for dead eye (I play on the PS4), I donâ€™t understand how to use it properly and never have, even in the first rdr and the zombie one."
RedDeadOnline,fmmnge9,t1_fmmeri4,1586208505.0,Iâ€™m not currently using any cards. I donâ€™t really understand them XD

depression,ffpyo3s,t3_eu7fur,1580111213.0,Iâ€™m so proud of you and you should be proud of yourself. What youâ€™re going through is so difficult but your actions have proven how strong you are. Keep on fighting!
offmychest,fez5pjg,t1_fez4yf9,1579454032.0,"Thank you, Iâ€™ll try to eat something soon"
offmychest,fey12x2,t1_fey0zqb,1579439395.0,I donâ€™t have anyone. I have never been able to talk to my family about this stuff and my only friends are always at work.
PiercingAdvice,fexz3nh,t1_fexz1jr,1579438604.0,Ah I can imagine! Thank you
PiercingAdvice,fexw0sx,t3_eqnwvt,1579437386.0,Did the industrial hurt??
AskReddit,fexut9o,t3_eqouu3,1579436759.0,I used a name generator because I wasnâ€™t creative enough to think of my own
PiercingAdvice,fexuo4g,t3_eqsax7,1579436574.0,"I would suggest no more than a couple of hours at a time. Because of the enzymes in your mouth, tongue piercings will close up pretty quickly no matter how long youâ€™ve had them for. Iâ€™ve had mine for about 3/4 years and I left it out for 2 hours once and it had a,ready started closing."
PiercingAdvice,fextxln,t3_eqstcj,1579436206.0,"I would definitely recommend letting it close up as due to the time youâ€™ve had it for, itâ€™s probably not fully healed yet. From personal experience it was harder for me to put jewellery back in after not having it in for a night and resulted in me bleeding and being in a lot of pain. If you have to put the jewellery back in yourself and it has partially closed then you have a higher risk of getting it infected. Hope it helps!"
BreakUps,fexfpjd,t1_fex7357,1579430236.0,"Your story is sad but so touching. Iâ€™m so sorry that youâ€™re going through these struggles and I really hope somebody comes along and help you to get back on your feet. Itâ€™s comforting to know that there are others that are going through hard times as it makes me feel less alone. As for your family, I wish there was so,etching I could say but Iâ€™m very shocked with their assumptions of you. I wish you all the luck in this difficult time and please know that I am available if you want to message me privately to tell me more about you or just rant."
BreakUps,fexf544,t1_feu8ukb,1579429982.0,Thank you so much for taking your time out to write that. I appreciate the advice
BreakUps,fexf2hw,t1_feu83xb,1579429945.0,"Ah thatâ€™s sucks, I hope you feel better soon. Thank you for the advice."

relationships,fetwlve,t1_fetwhe1,1579380773.0,Thank you so much. Iâ€™ll take everything you said into consideration
relationships,fetvk22,t1_fetuw4h,1579380508.0,"No, heâ€™s been suffering with mental health issues too but he just said that heâ€™s not in love with me anymore and he doesnâ€™t want to be in a relationship. We spoke about it in depth but itâ€™s not coming to me. Regarding the breathing exercises, I could only do them when he helped me with them as he was the only one that could calm me down. The break up is all Iâ€™ve been thinking about. Also, Iâ€™ve researched a lot about this and the things are always the same (distract yourself, breathe, be kind to yourself etc). Everything around me is so triggering and I have nobody left as Iâ€™ve never felt comfortable talking to my family about stuff"
relationships,fetu7ej,t1_fettt7g,1579380124.0,"Thank you for that, I really appreciate it. I wouldnâ€™t dare try to change his decision but he said not to talk to him until Iâ€™m over him (in a nicer way) so that we can be friends without me being hurt. All I wanna do is message him and hug him. I have no healthy ways of coping."
