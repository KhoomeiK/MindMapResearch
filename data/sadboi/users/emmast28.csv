BPD,fkftf7e,t3_fhrelw,1584142109.0,"Oh god, this! Yes! I've never related to a statement more! Also with what u/katemeowski said about BPD needing 9 lives. Since I was 16 (I'm 28 now), I've lived in at least half a dozen countries, each time living through a definite 'phase' of my life. So, the past 18 months I've been living in Paris, writing novels, working in a bookshop, going to art galleries, but next week (as long as France doesn't close their borders due to Covid-19), I'm moving to Greece to learn to sail, do some scuba diving, skydiving, boating, cliff jumping. After that, there'll be something else, new place, new job, new style, new tastes. In that sense, BPD means that I make the most of my life, I suppose. Though it also means that I never truly excel at anything, or have chance to climb a career ladder, or truly build a life in one location, because, after a year or so, I'm always looking at the next place, the next 'phase', and changing everything about myself to fit that new identity.

God, BPD can be hard."
