And doesn't mind sending dick pictures to women cause he says ""all women love dick pics"" and he has no problem getting a date or matches on tinder. Is that a good personality"
dating,fhxf3as,t1_fhxanu5,1581952887.0,How is it personality related? If you said that having a great personality will equally get you a date. Where I've given you examples of guys who have shitty personalities but they in long term relationships
dating,fhx6ikj,t1_fhosknp,1581946209.0,"I doubt it's a personality issue. I don't have experience in relationships, so I'm no love guru but I see who my female friends go for, for example, my one friend who I had a crush on picked a guy over me who made her feel insecure about herself and suicidal but they still together today and he is typical man, the only reason why she picked him cause he was her first. Second female friend, she's been on 3 dates and those 3 guys had great personalities but they all cheated on her and when she tried dating a woman, that woman also cheated on her and she has a wonderful personality. So I don't think its personality, I probably don't try hard enough to put myself out there or look after my looks but I've seen guys who were super depressed but end up dating and like magic, their outlook on life completely changed but cause they got an opportunity."
