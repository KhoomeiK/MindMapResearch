AsianParentStories,fqqwnxa,t3_gkcgf7,1589573308.0,"Here’s my take. No to low contact has been helpful to me. Though, I never went into with the intention of trying to improve my relationship with them. My relationship with my parents had been so far damaged to this point that I didn’t want anything to do with them, period. Once I let go, I felt free and and refreshed. They try to contact me every once in a while to talk, making that effort to try to improve things, but I just keep it short and move on. Partly because they’ve developed a repertoire where if I do, they do or say something that just hinders things further so I just don’t let them have that opportunity and also just because I no longer want anything to do with them. But that is solely me, not speaking for everyone else. I, personally, just don’t see the point in trying to carry on a relationship with parents who have been just awful. I’m a parent myself now and, like every other human in the world, I make mistakes as well, but I do everything I can to be the loving, present, and open-minded person for my kids. Something my parents failed to be for many reasons."
AsianParentStories,fq6wx70,t3_gh1bxm,1589138893.0,"Respect, in this case, is not a right, it has be to earned and your parents, especially your father, have lost that respect entirely. In my opinion, the first chance you get, move out and focus on taking care of yourself. It’s best to cut ties from all that toxicity. You do not owe them anything."
AsianParentStories,fkfh6ks,t3_fhwjhn,1584134310.0,"Let’s face it. When it comes to accepting reality, older generation Asian parents are just as likely to accept it as Trump is whenever someone fact-checks him."
AsianParentStories,fjzuivu,t3_ffh9y0,1583729842.0,"I feel for you man. My parents practically viewed anything that wasn’t studying as a waste of time as well when I was a kid. They couldn’t accept or wrap their heads around the fact that any sort of extracurriculars on your record DO make you more attractive to colleges compared to someone who only has good grades but did nothing else. All my teachers and counselors would say this and, in their minds, they came to the conclusion that they were all stupid. The only one that agreed with them was my SAT tutor (who was, obviously, also Asian. Not hard to figure out why he thought the same thing). The fact that they kept you from something like this that was not only educational and can teach you valuable skills for a promising career in the future but that it also cost you a potential shot at a scholarship is just irritating. I’m sorry that happened to you."
SingleParents,fe0924h,t3_enbyxe,1578806455.0,"I certainly can relate to this. There are times where it doesn’t bother me at all and I feel content with my life, but others, the loneliness takes over pretty hard and can be depressing. Doesn’t help when nearly everyone you know is in a relationship or married with or without kids. Certainly makes those group gatherings rather depressing when you’re the only single one nearly every single time. My particular situation makes it especially difficult and has, unfortunately, led to nothing but frustration that social norms make it so. I can only hope that things do get better for you later down the road, though."
AsianParentStories,fctquf3,t3_eio58p,1577954780.0,"Finding an older generation, asian parent who admits fault is like winning the lottery. The chances are slim. With parents as bad as that, it’s best to keep very minimal contact with them, if not cut them off entirely. Best not to be exposed nor allow yourself to be exposed to such negativity when it only causes you pain. Concentrate on yourself and raising your family in the best way possible. You already know this, but obviously don’t follow her example."

SingleParents,fbvq27q,t3_eehr2c,1577134418.0,"This is solely my opinion and experience, so I obviously can’t speak for everyone, but dating for me has been rather rough. I’m a father of two and split with my ex little over a decade ago. I tried dating for a few years, but none would stick. It’d be for a variety of reasons. Being Asian, that, unfortunately, means a lot of rejection. I’d get the reason from most that they just aren’t attracted to Asian men. By that logic, you’d think that those of the same ethnicity as me would be my best shot, but there I found another common trend that most Asian women (at least those who aren’t single parents themselves) aren’t interested in being with a single parent. My own parents, even thought this was a fact I should hide when it comes to dating, as if being a single parent is shameful, to which I responded “why should I?” My kids are a part (a very important part) of my life and and people are going to have to accept that no matter what. But, as I said, makes my dating life that much more difficult. And even when I did manage to get some relationships going, it was hard for me to dedicate enough time to the person between work and kids to make things last. I even dated one single mother who had a hard time understanding that fact (which was surprising to me because of all people, you’d think another single parent would be able to relate to that particular issue). I’ve spent years thinking that, eventually, that special someone will come along, but when you go through the trials of dating long enough, it’s easy to become jaded. Right now, I just try to work hard and be the best dad I can be. I do enter periods where I miss having a partner by my side and think that this is as good as things will get. At this point, I just have a hard time believing it will happen."

AsianParentStories,f4d9mpe,t3_dhyj2f,1571539700.0,"From my experience, there’s always a “friend’s kid” when really, half of the time, that “friend’s kid” doesn’t exist and they’re using it as a means to try and motivate you. Problem is, most Asian parents of that mindset can’t see or understand that that actually does more harm than good, making you feel inadequate and a failure in their eyes. What’s even more unfortunate, they won’t listen to reason and probably will never stop. May be hard, but best to ignore it and try to work on just feeling good about yourself and what you have accomplished/will accomplish. Retaliating will just egg them on even more to continue. I’d say just give them a simple “yeah, ok” and walk away to your room or somewhere they can’t chase after you to try and prove their point further. When they start to see that this little “tactic” isn’t affecting you like they expect it to, there’s a chance they may stop eventually."
AsianParentStories,f4c7b0l,t3_dk26oj,1571525211.0,"Funny how many of our own race want equality and fairness for all of Asian descent, yet they are also the ones who are incapable of accepting others of other backgrounds, especially of those who are darker skinned (Black, Mexican, Middle Eastern, and so forth).

Simple answer, live your own life and follow your heart. Be the better example. Do what you think and know is right. They need to learn to see past his skin color and accept him for, what I assume, the kind PERSON, HUMAN BEING, he is. Their actions only breed hate and also show just how self-centered they are. I’d say more, but I’d then be writing a full essay and this subject just brings out the worst in me."

Infuriated me to no end when I was a kid and still does as an adult. Also, despite the fact that I knew their minds would never change, that never stopped me from challenging them. I didn’t care to keep the peace and more felt the need to speak about what is right."

Your audio was a bit on the quiet side so maybe a better mic would do that trick (though I understand not wanting to break the bank on equipment). Maybe, for this kind of video, having the camera in front of you rather than from a weird angle from the side would work better. Just my opinion.

Criticism aside, you seem pretty knowledgeable on the subject you’re presenting, which is awesome. Just a little refinement and I can see this being a really interesting channel to watch and learn from!"

Yeah, friends maybe ask for some donations towards a cause, but then, it’s like, that donation can either make or break a utility bill coming up. I feel like anyone who doesn’t have that level of responsibility of being a parent can fully grasp the situation. They are not in it 24/7. They are aware it’s more expensive, but have no concept of the degree because they have no reason to look into it until they have to. Same thing with time. My friends are also wondering why I never seem to be available. It’s because I literally don’t have the time or extra money to spend. It’s mainly work and kids. That’s a majority of my life and I also don’t enjoy explaining it all the time."

SingleParents,ep3aupu,t1_ep2sg2l,1559020325.0,"No offense taken, and I’m glad you’ve taken such a positive approach to the situation within just a year, and perhaps that is also what contributed to you having a different experience than I have.

I never viewed my parenthood as a flaw. I’m proud of my kids and would never prefer a life without them, whether I was still married or not. I guess, I just grew more increasingly frustrated over time over why it seemed most asians that I’ve met have expressed it as a negative trait. Within in the first few years of my divorce, I tried to deny it, thinking that maybe it was only a handful that thought this way, but with each new case ending in the same result, it just added to the disappointment which, quite honestly, has left me a bit jaded.

But, I do agree that those who do look down on it are the not the kind of people I need surrounding my life and I should just go on living happy and proud regardless of my current parental status. Not that it should be an issue to begin with."
SingleParents,ep397bj,t1_ep34u3g,1559019681.0,"Oh crap. I’m really sorry. I mistook your comment about your divorced aunts as them being more understanding about your situation.

Seems like you’ve been able to get through it in your own right, but I’m sorry you had to go through all of that with your family. It really is awful. Every story I hear about Asian families dismissing the feelings and needs of one person all for the sake of preserving some sort of self-entitled image just adds to the disappointment and frustration I’ve had for years. The logic behind it is so narrow-minded and archaic, you’d think that mentality would’ve shifted by now, but we’re not even close and that way of thinking shows with each passing generation. Just adds to the hope that one day, they can be proven wrong, but it’s hard when you realize such a thing may actually never happen."

The same thought about moving has crossed my mind. Though, for one, I can’t because I don’t want to tear my kids away from their mother. I wouldn’t wish that upon anyone. Also, I feel shouldn’t have to completely exclude myself in the first place and that I should be accepted regardless of my status. You could say, it’s a bit of blind hope that it may actually happen. But, I also realized that that may very well be a never ending, uphill battle, one I’ll never see to fruition within my lifetime. A sad thought for sure.

I do have some Asian friends who never made me feel excluded, but even then, there’s a lack of understanding (which is understandable since they aren’t parents themselves), but, even more, a bit of unwillingness to even try and understand, if that makes sense. Hurts even more when they express denial over certain issues in the first place."
