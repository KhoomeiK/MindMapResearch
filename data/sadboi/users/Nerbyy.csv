It‚Äôs so fun and pretty. And colors look amazing against black skin. It makes everything pop. I love how expressive and cultural it can be.

I am a ghostly pale white girl with straightish brown hair and blue eyes and freckles. I saw this thing on tiktok where you draw yourself how you wish you were, not worrying about being fat, or thin, or tall or short. Completely customizable to how you want to look without social restrictions on beauty. My brain immediately thought i would probably want melanin skin and beads in my hair. I also enjoy making characters in games, where you can change your outfit a lot, have darker skin because I think the clothes look better.

This is coming from a position of pure admiration of the beauty of black characteristics. Is that offensive for a white girl to be doing? I asked on the tiktok, but only got one reply from a non-black person saying I probably shouldn‚Äôt do that. What do actual black people think of the matter?"
