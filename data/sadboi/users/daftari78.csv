islam,fomp21a,t1_fomnn55,1587898578.0,"Thanks for your insight. You have a really good point in that as humans there is simply much we do not know about the universe, the possibility that it was a coincidence is incredibly small, and science absolutely does not have all the answers. All of this seems so confusing sometimes but I guess if it were really that simple then life wouldn't be a test haha"

islam,fomg1z4,t1_fomfy3j,1587888702.0,Can I ask what made you come back?
islam,fomfkwp,t1_fomer7h,1587888216.0,"Thank you, it does help. Honestly I do believe because what you said summarizes my viewpoints too but then sometimes I'll read something and start questioning my imaan and then I feel bad about not being a good enough muslim. I wish my imaan was 100% concrete so that nothing could shake it."
islam,fomce8y,t1_fombtkm,1587885045.0,"Definitely. Sometimes I think about what my life would be like without islam, and I gotta say that the drinking, partying, and the pressure to live life the wildest way possible just because you only have one, doesnt appeal to me. Islam might come across as restrictive but it's also comforting and protective which is something we shouldn't tand for granted."
islam,fomc8pi,t1_fombkat,1587884895.0,"That's interesting, I guess it would be a blanket statement to say all muslims are against or for evolution. As per my research there definitely seem to be varying opinions, ultimately I guess it boils down to how you make sense of it. I've always kind of assumed that those fossils that are used to justify evolution might be the product of Allah's creations, similar to other animals but that's just my take on it. Also, do you know if the Quran states whether or not animals and jinn and whatnot were created first, and were living on earth before the creation of Adam?"
islam,fomaotx,t1_fomajlk,1587883443.0,"Thank you for your thoughtful reply.

islam,fom84kz,t1_fom7pnp,1587881127.0,"Well I've seen some stuff about how the Quran supports flat earth, and how it doesnt say that the universe is expanding rather it just says it's big. 

Also can I ask why you're so quick to dismiss a theory? Not trying to argue that point, but do you think that islam and science cant coincide?"
islam,fom79qv,t1_fom6vb0,1587880380.0,"Honestly I'd say a couple of things. 

1. I know the Quran states that Allah alone guides whom he wills, so by that definition if it's Allah's choice, how is it fair to throw people into hell fire if they werent chosen to be guided? (Hope that doesnt sound blasphemous) but I think the idea of how free will and qadr overlap doesnt really make sense to me

2. Also, idk I've seen some stuff about scientific inaccuracies and how many religious concepts can be explained by science, I.e  evolution, the big bang, etc, and as someone in the science field I want to be able to make sense of those things in the light of islam."

Honestly it makes me angry everytime bc I get it, my rituals are inconvenient but they're inconvenient FOR ME. Ever since I was a teenager I've been isolating myself from my family because I dont want to force my compulsions on them - like asking them to keep washing their hands and such so when they turn around and tell me I'm making their lives difficult when from my point of view I've been trying to leave them out of this,  really sucks."
OCD,fo49it1,t1_fo48t1g,1587500514.0,"Idk honestly I think they view it as more of a self imposed problem. And I get the feeling that they're not too fond of me going to therapy honestly, I initially brought it up and they agreed but then when I told them I didnt have a problem during an argument they enthusiastically agreed with me and told me I could figure this out so.

AskWomen,fgqel6t,t3_ezjjpk,1581022679.0,"That I'd rather impulsive and stubborn, not really that I make spur of the moment decisions but rather its that I'll be thinking of doing something drastic for a while but have no intention of acting on it until I just do, which comes as a shock to people around me.

OCD,fgob9l7,t3_ez7988,1580964539.0,"Basically, I have contamination ocd and for a good portion of my life my compulsions/obsessions involved making sure that I didnt touch anything outside of my contaminated bubble, so at home if I wanted to handle something other than my personal belongings, I'd have to wash my hands and if someone touched my belongings I had to beg them wash their hands before everything got contaminated. Fun times. 

Honestly I cant pinpoint exactly what led to this moment but like 2 years ago I was out with my family at a park and we were all having a good time when my mom asked me to hand her something, normally I would've refused or started looking for a bathroom first so I could wash my hands, but this time I resisted the urge which was easier I guess since we were in public, and after than incident it kind of got easier to slowly reintegrate myself with everyone else and feel ""normal"" again. Even though every now and then I give into my compulsions, at least I know it's possible to not give into them.

Good on you for resisting! It's the first step in a long winded battle but you'll be better off in the end. I guess try to be around friends and family and stay as busy as you can so you dont have time to be preoccupied with compulsions. Good luck!"

As far as feeling like your life could've been better, I find it's best not to get wrapped up in what could've been, it's only inviting regret and will make it harder for you to focus on having an amazing future.
