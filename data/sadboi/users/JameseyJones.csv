Despite being played on a literal shovel the ""guitar"" tones are massive compared to the original. Now part of that is simply improved technology. Chaosphere is getting long in the tooth. But Deftones - Around The Fur was released same year and the guitar on that album still sounds pretty crushing to me.

Meshuggah sounding tinny isn't even necessarily a bad thing. It's a stylistic choice they've made that differentiates them (as if they needed to differentiate themselves). I love Meshuggah - My whole point was that Mick isn't just channeling Meshuggah in his own tracks."

Id may have nominated a date for delivery during negotiations. It's Micks job to estimate how long the OST will take and whether he can meet the nominated deadline before he signs the contract. This is a critical skill of being a contractor and is not and should not be Id's responsibility.

That's the best case scenario for Mick. It's just as likely Mick nominated a date himself.

It's not the end of the world if a project is late. I'm working a project right now that I'm late on. Difference between me and Mick is I blame myself and am doing my best to make up for it. I didn't publicly throw my client under the bus."

Doom,fpin1ba,t1_fpi8axc,1588644324.0,">decent enough

Hulshult deserves a little more credit than that. One thing Hulshult includes in his songs that Mick sometimes forgets is actual melodies and chord progressions. I love Mick's work but he leans a little too hard on parts where the synths and guitars essentially become part of the drumkit.

Take [Burn in Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKCrkg7Kcdc&t=7309s) from Dusk for example. It's a Hulshult song chock to the brim with downtuned riffs and synths. Not a DOOM song by any means but it's in the same zipcode. Halfway into the song Hulshult crescendos the riffage into an epic chord progression that sounds like the world is coming to an end. It's simple as hell but oh so majestic.

If Mick had written that song it would have better production across the board and yet another bleepy bloopy chuggy thing in place of that chord progression.

I'm not shitting on Mick, just saying Hulshult would be more than just a sub-in. My dream Doom OST would be one where they collaborate and combine each of their strengths."

Can't blame him. That riff hits like a drunk driver at 1am and that album was all the rage when he was in high school (I know because I'm 1 year younger than him and also Australian).

Edit - Went to look it up and realised I'm remembering [Right Trigger Warning from Wolfenstein](https://youtu.be/eckQndnC_dg?list=RDsj5LYhwvHqw&t=205). Didn't use that riff in a Doom soundtrack but I still maintain Korn is an influence of his."

There is no ""good"" solution, only a least bad solution.  

>Could be it’s own post?

Yes. There's several threads on this topic because it's such a difficult problem to solve. 

A few tips from my experience:

1. You can probably forget about any pursuit which doesn't involve sitting down. 
2. The list of options shortens the more severe you are. I have enough capability to walk the dog or drive to an appointment a couple times a week and sitting in front of a computer for a few hours is still feasible.
3. I take dexamphetamine to help me think. Without it, I sit at the computer for 3 hours only to realise I've written 3 lines of code in all that time. It's like pushing thoughts through molasses. Your mileage may vary - I've read good and bad stories about amphetamines on this subreddit. For me it's a lifesaver. 
4. Doing something that contributes to society feels good even if it's just a tiny contribution. Makes me feel like less of a waste of oxygen. An example that fits in my life is answering programming questions on Stack Overflow or building a website for a non-profit. 
5. Ideally you want a fulfilling pursuit but without pressure. Right now I'm a victim of my own success - I've slowly won more ""prestigious"" projects but those come with deadlines. So try not to fall into that trap."

* Turkey closes the Bosphorus Strait? Oh no what will we do! Somehow I think the West will survive not being able to trade in the Black sea.
* Turkey funds radical Islamic terrorists against the West? They do that already. Who do you think ISIS was selling oil to?
* Turkey leaves NATO and kicks out American troops stationed there. Big fucking deal. Turkey has always been a shit ally anyway. Once the Kurds stabilise their territory and create a state the US could base planes there.

The Kurds are the perfect allies if you want to make the ME a better place. Their only flaw is they don't book out floors of Trump's hotels.

>US just doesn't want a massive conventional war

The US doesn't need to have a conventional war. Here's what you do:

You phone Erdogan, you say ""I see any Turkish military in Syria we'll bathe your staging areas and airbases in hellfire"". If a fighter flies into Syrian airspace you destroy the airbase. If a tank column drives into Syria you destroy the column. You'd only have to do this once, twice max and that'd be the end of Turkey's little ethnic cleansing adventure.

This isn't about regime change. This is about not stabbing the Kurds in the back for once."
