Miscarriage,fqm904n,t3_gjn9wr,1589473532.0,"I think this is a great point and it's important to talk about. With my first miscarriage I really didn't want a baby. I wasn't in a great position to have one and I certainly didn't want one with the father. I already had one kid and while I wanted more children in the future, I really didn't want one right then. I was considering an abortion, but then I had a miscarriage. It was still really hard to process and cope with. I felt like I made it happen, like I had killed this baby because I was being selfish (not that not wanting kids is selfish). It took me a long time to get over even though I wasn't sure I wanted the pregnancy.

I'm sorry you had to go through all those horrible thoughts along with the miscarriage. Your feelings are no less valid than anyone else's. I'm sorry for your loss."
