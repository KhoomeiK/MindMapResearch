You can be objectively, mainstream attractive (Jake Gyllenhaal) but creepy (Jake Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler.) 

It's not a line graph. It's not ""oh he's hot I'm going to allow him to be creepy."" I think guys forget not being creepy is a huge part of being attractive in the first place. 

Also being ""creepy"" and ""flirting"" aren't synonymous. Can you read a room? A situation?

Not necessarily typing this out in response to just this comment. Really noticing a lot of comments on Reddit lately like ""I'm not getting laid because I'm not attractive."" Nah my dude, it's more likely you're shifty and unsettling.

In a situation like this, where the guy is clearly crossing a professional line, he needs to realize he should only do this if she made it crystal perfect clear, like ""let's fuck sometime"" clear."
