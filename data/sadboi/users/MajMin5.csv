Buying an Apple product is less about the phone and more about the logo on the back, and I don’t just mean the “clout” of owning an Apple product. 

As you said, you don’t use iMessage, so right there you’re already down one major selling point of iOS. If you don’t have any other Apple products, you lose out on a lot of the real iPhone experience. 

When you go into a store to buy an android, you compare prices, features, gimmicks, and you have to decide what works best for you. You might switch brands, you might get a cheaper or more expensive phone. And then you get to spend time learning the new phone to find out all the neat tricks it can do that your old one couldn’t. When you go into a store to buy an iPhone, you buy the newest iPhone you can afford, transfer everything over, and the new phone works just like the old one did. No messing with settings, but also no discovering cool new settings. 

Security is a big selling point to an iPhone too, but if you’re not concerned about that then it’s not really an issue. 

AppleCare is one of the best aspects of Apple products. I’m not aware of any manufacturer warranty like AppleCare. Cracked screen on an iPhone 11 Pro Max? You’re out $329. If you have AppleCare? $29. It’s a no brainer. Pay monthly, cancel if you use up your incidents. Absolutely worth it. Samsungs premium care costs more, and has a higher deductible. 

So the iPhone isn’t about the iPhone. The iPhone is about the Apple services that come with it. And if you’re used to android, those services might not make as much of a difference to you."

Lenovo,fpteoa5,t1_fpru8fu,1588889872.0,"Let me sum it up this way 

Ideapads are consumer line computers, thinkpads are business line. 

Brand loyalty is not as common in the consumer market as in other places, most people when buying a new windows pc just buy whatever looks cool and has good specs for the price. Making a reliable product isn’t as big of a concern because companies know the consumer isn’t super likely to buy the same brand next time they shop. They make their consumer line look flashy and have good specs, but they make a lot of sacrifices to keep the price down since cost is a huge determining factor in buying consumer laptops. And if that computer fails and the customer swears they’ll never buy a Lenovo again, oh well, it was one less customer. 

In the Business market, companies but In bulk. I’m talking hundreds at a time. Schools, offices, hospitals, they’re spending thousands of dollars to get a ton of the same or similar machines in bulk. And they have to make those machines last until the budget allows for upgrades. So as a business, if you buy from Lenovo and 20 out of your 500 thinkpads fails after the warranty expires but before you have the budget to upgrade, you’re probably not going to look to favorably on Lenovo and you’ll buy from someone else next time. So now Lenovo doesn’t just lose one customer, they lose 500 sales per every few years. That hurts a little more. 

This isn’t just true of Lenovo either. Dell, hp, they’re all the same. Always buy business line. It may be slightly more expensive and a lot less pretty to look at, but they’re far more reliable because their target market needs them to be."

Just yesterday had a guy come in after getting his in-warranty iPhone 11 screen replaced by some third party place. So now his warranty is void, and his display is broken, so instead of paying the exchange price, where the service provider can send the part back to Apple for a discount, he payed full stock price for us to install an Apple display. Worst part is, the third party didn’t use normal adhesive strips to put the display in, they superglued it in, so now because of the superglue residue that I couldn’t fully remove, his phone might not be waterproof anymore. Those cheap screen replacements are cheap for a reason. Just go to an Apple authorized service provider and get it swapped out.

Chances are it’s still probably cheaper than just getting a custom order iMac"
mac,fowazlm,t1_fouh47s,1588116310.0,"Depends on the model year. 2012-14 it’s close to the edge of the board and you can replace it just taking out the fan. 2015 it’s not Upgradeable at all. 2016-19 it’s too far into the board and you have to take the whole logic board out to get to it. Someone correct me if I have the exact model years off, I haven’t worked on an iMac in a while since The Apple stores closed and I’m iPhone certified too."
mac,fowahk7,t1_foudyi3,1588116039.0,"What do you mean by the Laying? I’m in agreement that removal of the chinstrap is not necessary (source: am an ACMT certified Mac technician) on certain models, but I’m really confused what you’re talking about. 

To the others: taking those five screws out is no problem. Putting the chinstrap back in is a pain in the ass though, and if I think I can get the power supply out without too much hassle from the chinstrap I’d skip it too. On some models of iMac, can’t remember off the top of my head which, the chinstrap has to be removed because it has a cover over part of the power supply that you can’t get past. On certain models though the chin strap has no bearing on the power supply, I think maybe it’s the 2012 but I don’t know for sure without checking.


Edit: I’d like to revise my comment after reviewing the picture, I can see the cover part of the chinstrap, how the fuck did you get that power supply out??"

And my friends would laugh at the meme template if they understood the joke. But alas, I have nobody who would understand both to send this to. I will just laugh to myself."
delusionalcraigslist,fou4un4,t3_g93ihs,1588076237.0,"To be fair, if it wasn’t for the back glass this might be worth it. “Speaker only works on loudspeaker” sounds like it’s just the earpiece speaker (used for phone calls only) that is broken, and that’s part of the display. It’s only $169 to replace the display on an iPhone 8 from Apple, so you’d be getting an iPhone 8 for round about $400. Which, up until last Friday when the new iPhone SE (2nd generation) came out at $399, would have been a good deal for an iPhone 8. But the back glass being cracked ruins the whole thing because that’s not cheap to fix."
