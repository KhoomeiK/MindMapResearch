AskReddit,f7ikbis,t3_dw4v2m,1573760965.0,"I met two guys on a pub crawl in Barcelona in 2017 who were LOSING THEIR MINDS over selfie sticks. They each had one, couldnt stop taking pictures, couldnt stop raving on and on about them. This was a solid three years after the selfie stick really had it's big break so I was wildly confused until I asked them how they'd never seen one before and they told me they'd been in prison for over 10 years and just got out. 

As a small white female, two large black men who were in prison for over 10 years would probably make me nervous but the delight these guys had over such an arbitrary toy, while in the middle of a crowded bar, made it hard to feel anything except amused."

t caffeine really does make such a difference for me. Because I do really enjoy coffee, I will drink decaf if really in the mood. 

Also, I almost hate recommending this because it seems so trendy/cliche, but some sort of mindfulness meditation can be great. For me, it's not about completely quieting my brain but more learning to observe my thoughts without engaging with them is big. If you can learn to do this before bed it can be especially helpful when your mind is racing.

Last, but DEFINITELY not least. Exercise. It doesnt have to be intense training.
 A light jog, easy bike ride, or casual swim for 30 minutes 4 times a week is a total necessity for me."
