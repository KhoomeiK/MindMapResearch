SmolBeanSnark,fr46y2s,t1_fr463d4,1589877981.0,"I am so sorry you've had that experience.  Just from personal experience--my Mom was a DARVO master.  She has a lot of similarities to what the DSM describes as Cluster B behavior.  I've looked into a lot of resources for family members/loved ones of people experiencing those symptoms and found healing there.  If you have to be in contact with them, the ""grey rock"" technique can work wonders.  If not, cutting contact and focusing on your own growth and healing can help.  My Mom continues to bulldoze through life--mostly.  She is a criminal who got caught stealing from work at least twice and kept her job and even got an enormous severance package to go away.  Her free ride stopped when she moved into an active senior community and those women smelled out her fuckery and called her on it in a way my family never could.  So she's not perfect now, but she's definitely reformed more than I've seen in twenty years.  

I think what I'm trying to say is while it may never seem like justice will be done, and in MANY cases, the more manipulative they are, the more likely it is that it won't be done, but managing your own response to their antics is the ONLY way to control your experience with them.  And as with all things, the best revenge is living well. 
 Wishing you best of luck and healing."

SmolBeanSnark,fr45gqu,t3_glvure,1589876473.0,"I keep finding myself in this thought experiment.  

So let's just say you're incredibly ignorant on race issues because you've lived a privileged boarding school/Cambridge lifestyle.  Even though your degree is in art history, you barely make it through, so maybe your trolls claiming you should know better is a specious claim.  No doubt all of her electives for her major were all about the Western canon.  (If that's how the British higher ed system works; I find my own BA in psych limited because of what I decided to take for my upper division major classes and electives).

Back to the thought experiment.  You're also so narcissistic or troubled that you don't read anything in books, magazines, or on the internet about race issues for at least a decade.  (Which is, to me, an act of willful ignorance during Obama's presidency, BLM, and Trump's disgusting ascendancy, but for the sake of argument, let's just pretend.  There's only so many hours in the day to name-search after all.)

THEN, you fuck up royally with what the internet finds to be tone-deaf at best, dog-whistle as a straining-to-be-charitable view, or blatant racism at worst, posts.  You do this multiple times, across several races/ethnicities, and throw in problematic lusting after teenagers for style.  (Or just out of your own trauma or idiocy or both.)

I do understand that anxiety can result in both impulsivity and paralysis/hyper vigilance.  If you wind up continuing to get burned by your impulsive posting that paints you (deservedly) as a racist, how do you continue posting so harmfully and recklessly?!  Would you not be quadruple checking everything you posted for subtext you couldn't see because of your own pathology?  (But that would take admitting you're wrong, which you're allergic to...)

So assuming the best of her, which is: ignorance, narcissism, and mental illness...even then, how the fuck do you keep making this mistake?!!  You don't, not without an agenda.  I don't give her a lot of credit for running a long con, but I have known a host of martyrs and manipulators in my time and this is their game.  Use plausible (to your sycophants at least) deniability and make yourself the victim.  It is classic DARVO:  Deny the abuse ever took place, then Attack the victim for attempting to hold the abuser accountable; then they will lie and claim that they, the abuser, are the real vicim in the situation, thus Reversing the Victim and Offender..
