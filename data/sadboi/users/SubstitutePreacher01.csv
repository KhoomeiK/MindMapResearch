xbox,fqst1m7,t3_gkn47p,1589617831.0,100% was thinking about something like this the other day. Been playing modern warfare with some friends the past few weeks and one of our friends is on ps4 so we would have to use game chat. There was a while where the chat would just cut out and only a couple of us could hear each other or sometimes would cut out completely. Got to the point during a particularly intense round of warzone that we ended up switching on the fly to our Facebook messenger chat and got in a call with our headsets. Sometimes game chat is really just super unreliable and frustrating. So yeah I totally agree. Something that would allow players to have game audio and voice chat through one source and have it be reliable would be sweet

OutoftheAbyss,fqjaxd0,t3_gj6vbs,1589407420.0,I'm nowhere near it but I'm looking forward to it honestly. From what I've read of it it seems so interesting and wild. I'm excited to see how my players react to some of the outcomes. Though I will be taking out the option of the party starting the adventure from the beginning because that's just insane and I don't think my party would be too thrilled about it. Plus that's a ton of extra work for me to basically reset the world they've been travelling in. Just my opinion

OutoftheAbyss,fpsbcnv,t1_fprtjpo,1588870604.0,That sounds awesome. That's one of the reasons I wanted them to go deeper into the garden. But obviously it's the right choice for the party lol

confidence,fpp15dl,t3_gep333,1588794150.0,"At that age it is likely that this person is doing it out of insecurity. They feel insecure so they push it onto other people. They're projecting.

People like that aren't worth your time. Also focus on the positive :)"
OutoftheAbyss,fporewq,t1_fpom57l,1588789365.0,I wouldn't be worried about that for yourself. My party is fairly murderhoboy so it didn't really surprise me that much. I'll definitely be having the rest of the myconids at neverlight falling in with Zuggtmoy because all of the ones who were loyal to basidia and were also resisting Zuggtmoys spores have left. My party essentially doomed this colony without knowing it. Though basidia is going to search for a new home with her loyal myconids. The book doesn't detail what is supposed to happen with that. Next time we see them it's the wedding of araumycos so unless they decide to strike out and find her again I guess that'll be it. Either way yes lots of things for me to figure out. But they're on their way to blingdenstone right now and that's a whole other thing I gotta prep for.

I also am not a fan of artyom being almost entirely a voiceless protagonist especially when so many parts of the story would be so much more powerful if artyom said anything. Especially when his friends are begging for him to respond on the radio and he's just chilling in a radioactive metro or mine ignoring them while they're scared he's dead. Or when someone asks him a question straight up and he just stares at them lol. Don't get me wrong I fucking love these games, that's just something I've had an issue with. Sorry for rambling"

Almost the exact same thing happened to me less than a year ago. A girl I was incredibly obsessed with started seeing a guy what used to be my friend. He knew how I felt about her and still went for her anyways. I've never forgiven him for it. I went to therapy too and it ended up helping. Keep going to this therapy and be completely honest. Another thing I recommend, as hard as I know it is from personal experience, distance. I know it sucks to hear but it really is needed. I was on my last legs mentally before I took some time away from this girl. She was all I thought about. We texted almost non stop and when we weren't texting, I was talking to her at her house. It's unhealthy. I had to see that and now so do you. Talk to her about it and tell her it's for your own good. Tell her you'll crumble if you don't. Trust me, I know it's going to feel like you're getting punched in the chest but a little break will be good. Try not to text her or call her for a certain amount of time and focus on other things. It's an addiction at some point. You get addicted to this girl and the feeling of talking to her and that you can't let go of the fact that she wants to date your best friend. Which by the way your best friend isn't that good of a friend if he knows how you feel and is still going through with it. Idk if he is or the exact situation but I've been there. Ok now I'm rambling. For real though, I've been in your exact situation and it sucks hard, I still feel pain about this thing that happened to this day. But you deal with it. And it gets easier. Take care of yourself mentally. You are the most important person in your life. Don't put her first, put yourself first. I hope this helped at all. Good luck my brother."
