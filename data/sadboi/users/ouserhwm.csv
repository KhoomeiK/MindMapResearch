I need to do more work on talking about dating with my husband. We are open and we date casually. His dating elicits an emotional reaction- jealous and sometimes insecure. I know I'm a bit possessive. I need to work on that and I do. That is what makes dating for us doable. DADT doesn't work for me because it feels disconnected. When we are talking about who we are looking at to date we are discussing and teaching the other about our selves. That is much more positive for us.

You are also right- the STI risks etc can not be transparent if you have don't ask don't tell. That feels unsafe and in this case I have seen couples- in your position- decide that they will use condoms since they don't know their risk factor. 

Best of luck moving forward."

I had to lose weight  and improve my self esteem and then I was ready to go there.

Listen to yourself and follow what you want.

I felt totally angry that my husband had the same line as yours - that I had a double standard. I didn't open the door. But in the end i decided I could try to manage my feelings around him dating and getting extra reassurance through that.

It took me 6 years of playing with other guys and losing 50+ lbs to feel confident enough.

2: if you mean the theory of openness or having online dates for now- it only works if you are both game, but I personally need a lot of reconnecting after my husband has a date- and I know he does with me too... so long distance would be extra hard.
3: changing a dynamic 3x in a short span would be crazy making for me. A) newly LD b) pandemic stress and isolation c) adding extra people

Regardless of if it will ever work for you- right now seems terribly fraught with multiple stressors.

I only got to ENM after 5 or so years of hotwifing... took me that long to let myself be able to give my husband that trust and autonomy and experience to date. He was patient obviously. Hotwifing had been his suggestion. Him dating was mine.

Good luck whatever you decide. Try to speak with curiosity and compassion and leave your defensiveness at the door. (My personal challenges to conquer....)
