So it doesn't matter if their heart is in the right place, they just cannot help it even if they wanted to. Now this is a grey area cuz of factors like the severity of the illness and what they're doing to treat it to name a few. But my point is it's not something external, it is a part of them, it's innate to them, it's who they are. That plays a very important role in shaping their behaviour. Hope that makes sense. That being said, there's many morons out there who use it as an excuse and expect a pass every time. Cuz here's the thing about mental illness, unless it's something really bad like a syndrome that the patient does not have a clue what is happening to them or is special needs, you always have the choice of fighting it and keeping things in check and it's a constant battle and it's hard but if you're a responsible adult, you do those things so you can function close to normalcy and make your life a bit easier. Instead, not doing those things, solely relying on medication and other forms of addiction and expecting a pass is not decent behavior. So there's some truth to what you're saying but some people really are in a bad place plus life has probably dealt them such a bad hand that they really do need some extra help. It's all circumstantial mate, can't generalize but there's those times when it's truly the reason and not an excuse.

They're so gross and awful... 

Dogs have descended from wolves, so they're pretty much domesticated scavengers. Ergo the foul smell and shit/garbage eating habits.

On a slightly different but related note, people who eat game meats don't consume wolf or other scavenger meats for the same reason. They're riddled with parasites and toxins and not suitable for human consumption. That alone should be telling how filthy these creatures are. IIRC, Islam forbids them as pets. Scavengers are cleaners of the ecosystem. Which is why they're never clean themselves and should not cohabit with us. They're also nocturnal so tend to keep you up at night. Not to mention the pack mentality like wolves and hyenas which is why they make a mess of things and run around like crazy destroying things. There is just so much pent up energy that is simply NOT compatible for urban environments and modern human lives. We DO NOT live in caves any more. We have extremely busy and demanding lives where some peace while resting at night or a bit of quiet personal time on the weekends is really appreciated without having to worry about some stupid mutt destroying our furniture or brain cells cuz they're causing us constant sleep deprivation.
