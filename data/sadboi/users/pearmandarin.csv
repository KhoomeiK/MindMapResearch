askTO,fr3ieiy,t3_gmd1xu,1589858075.0,"Sorry to hear about your grandaunt. I was once an international student so I totally understand your worry about having no one else to rely on here. However I can assure you everything will be ok, just take a deep breath! I would recommend figuring out your rent budget, and do the following things:

1. Contact your college, lots of colleges in Toronto have an international student support office of some sorts. Ask them if they can help you find a place to live.

2. Go to facebook and look up Toronto rental pages. There might be even a page that are created by people from your community (same background as you), they might be more understanding with your situation regarding limited income due to the 20 work hours rule.

3. Go to kijiji and search for a basement room for rent. Check the room out if possible and if it‚Äôs safe to do so. Widen your search if needed (GTA, not just Toronto) to have the rent fits your budget.

Good luck, you‚Äôll be fine!"

askTO,fqraj64,t3_gke7fd,1589580651.0,"Seriously $1450 for a one-bedroom apartment near Yonge and Eg is definitely such a steal! However I wouldn‚Äôt move if you plan to save for a big purchase (for example, a home), or don‚Äôt plan to live there for a long time (like more than 10 years) because in case you want to move to something else cheaper, your now-bachelor price range won‚Äôt be easy to find. Another thing to note is if you don‚Äôt have a partner who can share the rent with you, making the move doesn‚Äôt make the most financial sense. Also as someone who used to live and work near Yonge and Eg, Eglinton station is always such a mess. Your 35-minute train ride will easily be almost an hour due to delay and overcrowded trains etc. Of course I don‚Äôt know what will be post covid but it‚Äôs something to consider."

We got engaged in 2018 and I was trying to avoid wedding planning for as long as possible because every time I look at the cost I just want to cry. Then we finally made a plan and this pandemic happens. I hope it‚Äôll all work out for you."

askTO,fqdhoqi,t1_fqdflbk,1589289895.0,"Thank you for your reply. I‚Äôm not sure if the price of Toronto housing market will drop, but I‚Äôm willing to buy either in the outskirt of GTA as long as there‚Äôs a go station. Sorry to hear about the accident you had, the traffic on Bloor, doesn‚Äôt matter which intersection, is just madness!"
askTO,fqdbfrv,t1_fqd9cia,1589285647.0,Well said. Just curious - how were you able to save for a downpayment? I‚Äôm trying to save for a home too but it‚Äôs so hard!
CanadianInvestor,fq9yorf,t3_ghnvre,1589209620.0,I have been able to trade via RBC DI. It‚Äôs $9.95 per trade though but I‚Äôd rather use a slightly more expensive platform if it works.
askTO,fps8x7h,t3_gf5snj,1588869446.0,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs legal to require such things. But keep in mind if you live in the same property as your landlord, it‚Äôs best to find a common ground to live in the same house. I myself have had a roommate (top floor of a house), and the landlord was living on the ground floor. The roommate and I shared the same kitchen and bathroom, landlord has her own amenities downstairs. We had to follow the rules of not having more than one guest each at the same time, which to me was understandable because it was a small house. However my roommate kept inviting her whole group of friends from work, which was usually about 3-4 people. That resulted in inconvenience for both me and the landlord due to noise level and quite frankly, it was very awkward for me to walk around in my shitty pjs to go to the bathroom and past a bunch of strangers. Anyhow, what I‚Äôm trying to say is don‚Äôt say yes to all the rules with the intention that you won‚Äôt follow any of them, you don‚Äôt want to live somewhere where there‚Äôs tension between you and the landlord. The roommate I had before was very stubborn so every time we need to have something fixed, the landlord always agreed to help but never tried to tend to it as quickly as she could. Or I always have to ask her to trim the tree‚Äôs branch outside my room‚Äôs window because it was blocking the sun. But because of the said tension between her and my roommate, and technically the tree branch wasn‚Äôt a safety hazard, she never did it. It could be because she is just lazy, yes, but I believe largely because she doesn‚Äôt care to help due to the constant noise level and inviting more than one person over caused by my roommate. Can‚Äôt say it was enjoyable to live there after 1 year so I moved out. The bottom line is: you don‚Äôt need to be friends with your landlord, but you need to be mindful of their rules. I would find another place that has less bizarre rules, or find an apartment that you don‚Äôt share with a landlord and look for a roommate yourself if it‚Äôs out of your budget."

PersonalFinanceCanada,fp9dqry,t3_gblv9t,1588423355.0,"100000% agree with this. I have been saying this from the beginning of the pandemic since I know a few people working as tellers. There‚Äôs a story about people coming in screaming and refusing to wash their hands or having ridiculous demands almost everyday whenever I talk to them. 

Respect others, there‚Äôs no need to be mean and rude to a person who was simply doing their job. This is needed at all times, but especially during this time."

mentalhealth,fp04sv6,t3_ga7con,1588202489.0,"Hi there, I think you sound like a loving and caring person, and you deserve so much love from your family, your husband, your little son, your friends and especially from yourself. Being able to write all of this down definitely takes courage and I hope you can acknowledge your bravery. 
I can relate to so much from your post, I find myself feeling sad and guilty at the same time a lot. I come from a family with a history of mental health issues, but sadly I‚Äôm the only one who accepted it and seek professional help. I encourage you to speak to a therapist if you have the ability to. It helps somewhat, but it will always be a progress, and that progress of ‚Äútrying to not feel sad‚Äù is absolutely normal in my opinion. 
You are not NOT normal, we all have our thoughts that can talk us down and isolate us from our circle of people. Sadness is normal. And the guilt that comes with it is because you are a mindful person who is aware of your lovely life, not because you are spoiled. Having a job doesn‚Äôt define who you are, but I truly hope you will find your artistic inspiration again in the near future. Much love and I wish you all the best."
mentalhealth,fosrumm,t3_g9bq5h,1588036752.0,"I feel the same way. I can share what‚Äôs been helping me though, I limit watching news to only once every 2 days, and even so I only quickly check updates on new york times. I deleted all social media apps on my phone and I found a few podcasts and books recommendations here on reddit that talk about everything BUT the pandemic. I know it sounds easier than done. It does take time for the negative feeling to slowly fade away, but I can say I don‚Äôt wake up in the middle of the night worrying about what might happen to my family as often. I hope this somewhat helps and we can all return to having the confidence of having social interaction without worrying about anyone‚Äôs health soon. All the best!"
PersonalFinanceCanada,foiahe6,t3_g7eqlx,1587782178.0,"I work in a financial firm so I see quite a lot of different people in different financial situations. And you are definitely not behind. I know people who have been renting all their lives, and they try to save as much dollars they make as possible. I would suggest to start saving more, open a retirement saving plan and a tax free saving account. You don‚Äôt necessarily have to own a property to show you‚Äôre ahead of anyone. In my opinion, the most important things cannot be seen anyway, like happiness (it might sound cheesy I know) and wealth aka your savings. Good luck and all the best!"
