Seriously, if you can't get by depending on the salary of one of the parents so that the other one can stay at home at least for the first 3-6 years, maybe you shouldn't be a parent at all.

Idk I was raised in a society where at least one of the parents would stay at home until the child is 3-6 years old (many of them actually stay at home until the kid is an adult) and it's just weird for me to hear about  societies where parents are encouraged to get back to work asap after they had a baby.

I guess it has to do with giving your kid a chance to get a higher education in the form of supporting them while they're at school.

Those who leave school at 16, attend a special kind of school where half the time, they attend lessons and the rest of the time they kind of prepare for the job they're going to have later in life, so I they have to work a half time job, I guess.
