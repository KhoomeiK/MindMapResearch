Monitor Audio and Revel are rather neutral, but have always failed to excite me (I owned the Silver 2s for a bit).

I found the GoldenEars I heard quite disappointing (though I only listened once, and it could have been something other than the speakers).

Focals have consistently been too bright for my liking.

Grey-sexual probably fits me best, since i have nothing against it, can be convinced I want it (by the right partner at the right time), enjoy, and have had fantasies about pleasing a partner.

I've considered I might be demi-sexual, since I have absolutely no interest in casual sex, but have assumed sex to be a (small) part of a relationship--though that might only due to media.  However it seems that once they're attracted to someone, it sticks--where as I pretty much have to be seduced every single time, and generally would prefer to do something else instead.

I've enjoyed my share of romantic relationships (though I've spent far more time single and not giving a damn) and it's almost always been the other person that made it clear we were dating and not just friends.  (I can't count the times I've been told people 'liked' me, but didn't think I was interested.)  But, outside of a handful of crushes, I've never really cared that much whether I was seeing someone or not; friendship is just as important to me.

For the longest time I just assumed I was more intellectual and emotional than my partners who I considered more physical and practical.  My lack of passion and initiation has always been something of an issue--but only recently was it the biggest (perhaps only one).  

It all came to a head in my last relationship; my ex (who broke up with me two years ago) had rather low esteem and took my lack of desire very personally.  I tried to explain that I found her just as attractive as any of my other exes, but she never really believed it.

It's probably best not to compare yourself and your ability to cope with hardships to others.  But if you must, feel free to compare yourself to me; someone's who's dealing with less trauma and is probably less motivated or capable than you.

It's cliche, but you should go to therapy if you can; and don't be afraid to try medication if it's suggested.

If all you have available to you is 'getting your ass in gear' and hoping that it sticks, then you may as well try it; it certainly can't hurt.

depression,f81krdu,t3_dyil95,1574170536.0,"Sorry to hear that; wish I could help but functioning in society isn't exactly my strong suit.  

I had nightmares about my previous job for over a year after I quit (now I'm just broke and dependent on family--sorry no success story).  They were constantly changing my schedule and wouldn't even make accommodations so I'd be able to get just 4 hours of sleep between shifts; somehow that would be 'special treatment.'  Of course management was both lazy and incompetent, causing huge issues and inefficiencies, but any time a customer complained it was always a front line employees fault.

Sometimes I wonder if I'd be so depressed if I could have a job where people treated me like a human, payed well enough that I could afford healthcare and be independent--but mostly that feels about as likely as winning the lottery.

(I was trying to be sympathetic, but I think all I did was rant about my shitty life and work. Sorry.)

Anyways, good luck."
depression,f81jehe,t3_dyj19v,1574169341.0,"Sometimes I feel guilty posting here, because I know money would solve at least a few of my problems.  And I know I could easily distract myself for about a year, traveling to places I've always wanted to visit, eating local cuisine, etc. 

Still, so many things I used to love don't really mean anything to me anymore, so odds are it really would only be a sort term solution."
depression,f81ivms,t3_dyjcym,1574168866.0,"How to deal with depression is not something most people learn.  So unless you're dating a therapist, or someone who's also depressed, you're not likely to find much more understanding or sympathy.  (It's really difficult for two depressed people to maintain a healthy relationship, btw).  

And really he's not giving bad advice (for most people).  If you're not in a long term committed relationship he's under no obligation to really try to figure why he's wrong or how to do better.  If you want this to last, maybe point out resources on depression to him (this sub is a starting point, if nothing else)."

SuicideWatch,f7zivr2,t3_dy7hka,1574111359.0,"That sucks. Hope you find a place that appreciates you.  My last in retail made me literally suicidal; trying to find anything different is beginning to do the same.  Seems I'm not qualified to spin signs, be a dishwasher or even pick up shit in a dog kennel. Good luck."
audiophile,f7uqtfz,t3_dww8y8,1574017117.0,"Heard the 40s at a show a couple years ago and loved them.  Also a nearfield setup, though a much larger room; a very neutral sound that I could see some might find boring, but they had real presence.  They also played the Super 5s (same room, same amp, different track though), and wow they sounded harsh and brittle comparison.  I couldn't believe it was the same company."

SuicideWatch,f7scw52,t3_dxku7z,1573993425.0,"Yeah, it makes a type of sense; but people fail to realize that it's usually a permanent solution to like 99 problems of indefinite length, that interact in such a way that unraveling just one of them either is seemingly impossible, or causes two to three more."
SuicideWatch,f7sc29j,t3_dxl2nd,1573993204.0,"Haha, yeah, I don't get why these shows keep getting renewed?  I don't even attempt to recap more than the last season anymore.  At least I don't get that response; just concerned looks and vague well wishes, thoughts, prayers, etc."
SuicideWatch,f7sas94,t3_dxl7cd,1573992846.0,"Unfortunately I don't quite think that anyone that's a regular on r/suicidewatch is going to be up to helping you.  However if this is true, you (or perhaps your friend, assuming he's relatively healthy and financially stable) could likely help quite a lot of people here.  Many people here (myself included) are stuck in bad life situations where money, while likely not solving everything, would at least get us to a place where we could get help and begin healing and living.

Regardless, I'm sorry to hear about your health.  Good luck."

depression,f7oh91q,t3_dx9t87,1573927422.0,"I won't say you're not alone in your own life; but I feel you.  Everything is similarly screwed up for me: no job, no car, no support.  Foolishly tried to be proactive today and looked at some job listings--only to realize I'm not qualified for even the most basic positions.  Now I'm even more miserable. Everyone says try harder, but I just don't think I can anymore."
