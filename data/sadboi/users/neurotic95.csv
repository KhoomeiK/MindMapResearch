My favorite memory would have to be... any time he and I have a moment where he’s serious and I’m serious. My dad suffered abuse growing up and is now dealing with cancer. His coping mechanism has always been to be a jokester, and he’s quite sensitive. So when he tells me how he’s so proud of me or how he’s so happy I came out to be a good and nice person, I know he truly means it. We’ve both grown so much and I love him deeply."
