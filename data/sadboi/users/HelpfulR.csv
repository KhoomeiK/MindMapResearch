bipolar2,fh8ax8q,t1_fh8an0m,1581355848.0,Yep and thinking about all the fun things you have and will miss just makes you even more anxious. You feel like a fuck up because no one else crumples in anxiety at any slight situation. It sucks. Today I‚Äôm feeling the self pity party.

Then I understand why he‚Äôs staying up so late."
bipolar2,fcxavgg,t3_ejeqaq,1578057737.0,"Short answer: Yes

Long Answer: I find that sometimes, like you, I can be fine and other times it triggers a negative down spiral of thoughts. I was drinking almost every day (a beer or two max) and found when I stopped doing that the same thing happened too for a day."

I have never tried a stimulant or adderall specifically. I don‚Äôt know whether it would help or not. I know that most doctors are hesitant to prescribe stimulants to those of us with BP because it can easily trigger (hypo)mania. I am looking to start some form of ADHD med for my own reasons so I‚Äôll loop back to this post if it‚Äôs a stimulant and let you know since I‚Äôm also on lamictal. 

Best of luck and I hope things get better for you"
bipolar2,f9nwwus,t3_e60v2l,1575492022.0,I agree with a few of your points. What makes it work for me is a lot of hard work on my part through self reflection etc... I find the more I‚Äôm in touch with what‚Äôs going on the easier it is to make the relationship work because I know things like ‚ÄúI want to go out and fuck anyone because I‚Äôm hyper sexual from hypomania‚Äù aren‚Äôt ‚Äúreal‚Äù but just a product of what‚Äôs going on chemistry wise. Very tough don‚Äôt get me wrong but just being aware like you are is half the battle I think.
bipolar2,f9mho5e,t3_e5spmc,1575459435.0,"As others have said, meds make things much easier, stabler, and overall a better experience. What they don‚Äôt do is take everything away. There‚Äôs still plenty to work on in therapy and your own to handle the ups and downs life throws at you but that‚Äôs true of anyone. Meds just give us the ability to be on a more level playing field when dealing with those ups and downs.

Also as someone else said, I 110% post here when I‚Äôm struggling. I comment when I‚Äôm doing well. It skews what you see on the page. You‚Äôll see mostly bad things but positive comments in my opinion."

bipolar2,f8v05if,t1_f8u5gei,1574853763.0,I appreciate the advice. I currently do both medication and therapy it‚Äôs more a matter of do I stick with my current medications that seem to be working really well except for this one thing and work on it with therapy or do I advocate for change? I wanted perspective of what other people have dealt with.
bipolar2,f8toft1,t1_f8tgepu,1574807830.0,I think that‚Äôs a good way to look at it. Meds have helped slow it down so I can recognize it. Now it‚Äôs just fighting it.
bipolar2,f8sqzbk,t1_f8si7f5,1574787159.0,Thanks. Maybe they are delusions? The other day I wanted to talk to a friend about it and I thought the apartment was bugged so I had to do it in the car so that probably counts. It really depends on the day or week how bad it is. I just don‚Äôt know where to draw the line at a med problem or a me problem.
bipolar2,f8sqtqt,t1_f8shkvm,1574787060.0,I can‚Äôt distinguish between what‚Äôs normal paranoia that‚Äôs something I should try and deal with as therapy and what‚Äôs I should try to address with meds.

bipolar2,f86i7w4,t3_dz8k8t,1574298845.0,Vraylar seems to be a miracle drug for everyone I talk to. I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs working for you too!
bipolar2,f84hv85,t1_f829m1y,1574249312.0,"As someone else replied to this, I‚Äôve heard trazadone is a nightmare when it comes to appetite increase. Lamictal is supposed to be weight neutral. I can vouch that I‚Äôve only gained a pound or two on it so it mostly lives up to that claim. Fluoxetine may also make you gain a little weight just because it‚Äôs an SSRI and they‚Äôre known for doing that as a class of drug overall. Not sure whether it is specifically known for doing that or not but SSRIs are for sure."
bipolar2,f84hnuh,t3_dyqy9s,1574249032.0,"I‚Äôll back up /u/MedicalEnigma4. Started out as severe depressive episodes and anxiety for me as a kid. Then I don‚Äôt know about for them but for me I then started getting the ups about my mid to late teens. Every summer I would get the hypomanic stages and then I‚Äôd crash. Took me almost 15 years to get diagnosed. Where I agree with MedicalEnigma again is the meds take a long time to get sorted out. Took almost 2 years to get the cocktail of meds sorted out. Also, where I agree again is you need a psych you can trust. Mine is awesome. Without her knowledge, I wouldn‚Äôt have found the meds that work."
bipolar2,f84hce4,t3_dyrak9,1574248594.0,"That‚Äôs really interesting. I‚Äôd trust your gut (side note: I‚Äôm a big proponent of trusting your gut) and believe it‚Äôs the Vraylar and not the lithium. The only confounding factor about the first incident is that you had a migraine which could cause some depression like symptoms I imagine. 

I know for me Vraylar pretty much instantly lifted my depression so I imagine if I missed a dose it would instantly stop working too. That‚Äôs my only answer to your question as I‚Äôm not about to skip a dose to find out üòù"
bipolar2,f84h6hs,t3_dyxm7t,1574248363.0,Is it an all day thing or just a when you take your pill thing/how often do you take pills? This is probably not the answer you‚Äôre looking for or the answer you want but the only solution I had to a fatigue issue with a medication I was on was to switch. Sorry. The only other thing I can think of is to time it with sleep or lots of coffee?
bipolar2,f7y7a6h,t3_dy2rdp,1574088392.0,"My vote is see a therapist. Whether you feel like it‚Äôs worth seeing one or not, I think you should. It sounds like all of the things that happened affected your life in various ways. Plus, the worst that happens is that you talk to someone a few times about your life and it turns out you didn‚Äôt need it and you go on your merry way."
bipolar2,f7y735n,t3_dy1wa8,1574088243.0,"I guess I have had good luck. They don‚Äôt necessarily make me lose weight but they are weight neutral (the ones that are supposed to be like Latuda, lamictal, etc...).

Abilify was poor for me. I gained maybe 15 pounds. It wasn‚Äôt as bad as seroquel or some other notorious ones (risperidol was another one for me). I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre going through this. It‚Äôs very tough!"
bipolar2,f7xvxf7,t3_dxuwhn,1574077855.0,I‚Äôve definitely had poor reactions that have included suicidal thoughts. When this has happened my pdoc has immediately taken me off it so I‚Äôd say get in contact.
bipolar2,f7tjx9b,t3_dxhggj,1574005094.0,"I took both. I‚Äôll tell you my experience but remember everyone is different. It stabilized me. I took them for about 9 months. The whole time (I didn‚Äôt really realize it until towards the end and I didn‚Äôt realize the culprit was Latuda) I felt like a zombie without a personality and I felt really dumb (poor word recall, poor cognitive capability etc...). I just recently switched to Vraylar. I still feel stabilized but holy moly do I feel like a different person. I have my personality back, I feel smarter/have my vocabulary back (though I‚Äôve made some dumb mistakes that I attribute to medication based cognitive decline) and I don‚Äôt feel like a zombie. Hopefully the combo works for you in a very successful way. It really helped me in a time of need but without realizing it, it wasn‚Äôt a perfect fit so just be watchful is my advice about this combo and meds in general."
bipolar2,f7mzezv,t1_f7mxcm5,1573878594.0,My anxiety has been under control through my other medications and skills. I think the Vraylar has been helping though!
bipolar2,f7mackc,t1_f7lidr8,1573858033.0,I don‚Äôt know about you but I had no idea that Latuda was having that effect on me. I knew I was dull and personality-less but I never knew it was the Latuda. I have my fingers crossed for you!
bipolar2,f7jz2cv,t3_dwf9ap,1573790160.0,I have a weird sort of opposite of this. I forget what depression feels like when I am depressed. I will be depressed and live it for long enough that I forget that there‚Äôs any other way to live. Then I‚Äôll forget what depression feels like and accept it as what normal feels like if that makes sense?

It‚Äôs also not like I‚Äôm all powerful and great like I normally feel, just paranoid so I‚Äôm hoping it really is just me starting to feel good and normal again."
bipolar2,f7jfqk3,t1_f7j5ku8,1573776655.0,"I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs so much activating as it is less sedating. I took it in the morning at first to not take it on top of the Latuda and the Vraylar didn‚Äôt put me to sleep. I wake up in the morning now rather than fight 30 minutes to wake up.

bipolar2,f6r1nsg,t3_dspnkx,1573091470.0,We‚Äôre you taking it at night and still finding it sedating the next morning? I‚Äôm about to go on it from Latuda. I find that Latuda makes me really sleepy once I take it and harder to wake up but then I‚Äôm fine. Now I‚Äôm a little worried but it‚Äôs a small price to pay for better stability/if it works better as an antidepressant
bipolar2,f6r1agk,t3_dsow7d,1573091204.0,Best of luck to you! Scary jump but it sounds like you‚Äôve done you‚Äôre research and you‚Äôre prepared. ü§ûfor you!!!

Try to remember those happy things if you can. The medications are hard to get right and to get a stable balance if you're going that route. They do (for me) provide some semblance of stability of balance and I keep trying my hardest to get to a point where they will keep me stable enough that I'm happy every day."

Sheer will and determination were what kept me taking the pills sometimes and knowing that it would eventually help. It‚Äôs not easy by any means. Keep trying as best you can. Any little bit helps!"
bipolar2,f3r35z3,t1_f3plzex,1571083896.0,"I‚Äôve never been delusional from sleep deprivation. It‚Äôs embarrassing though knowing you see l, hear, or feel something that no one else does and it‚Äôs not real. It‚Äôs so much safer when you can escape from that."
bipolar2,f3r2r94,t1_f3q1wpd,1571083807.0,"It‚Äôs amazing what a regular sleep schedule will do and motivating yourself to get up and go can do. Sometimes it‚Äôs so hard though when the first thing that happens when you wake up is hearing that voice say ‚Äúkill yourself‚Äù. 

I will say I hear you loud and clear on vacation. I just recently went on one and it was SO stressful. All I wanted to do was sleep and not explore at all. Took so much effort to go out and do things."
bipolar2,f3pd1ry,t1_f3oxfw2,1571055355.0,Mine snuck up on me. It wasn‚Äôt until a day ago I realized as I was talking it out that it had become a problem and that I agreed with all of this.
bipolar2,f3pczyt,t1_f3oxpy9,1571055301.0,"If it keeps you alive sometimes it‚Äôs a necessary evil. I know it‚Äôs not healthy but as some of those point out in a way, it‚Äôs better than being dead or torturing yourself with your mind."
bipolar2,f3pcxx2,t1_f3p5k0n,1571055239.0,Yes or being asleep is the only way to be alive is how I see it. I‚Äôm spending the majority of these last two weeks asleep when I‚Äôm not working.
bipolar2,f3pcw7y,t1_f3oz5os,1571055187.0,Keep fighting as best you can. I imagine that‚Äôs incredibly tough to do without facing any struggles and only tougher facing our struggles.
bipolar2,f3od4al,t3_dfwkgd,1571014686.0,Seconded. Everyone supporting each other is what helps us get through the tough times and the slightly too good times.
bipolar2,f3ob94r,t1_f3ifjod,1571013283.0,Oh man! So happy to know I wasn‚Äôt alone when it came to strattera side effects. That tingling feeling was the worst. Mine was in my tailbone. Made me feel like there was a fire in my tailbone and sometimes I had to lay done in a fetal position to let it pass!
DestinyTheGame,f204nfe,t3_dbalem,1569855224.0,"I was helping my friend through his first Kings fall raid with an LFG. About 3/4 of the way through one guy shouts over his mic ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt honey, saving the world from this bitch Oryx. Maybe later.‚Äù Reminded me of this."
bipolar2,f1visgi,t1_f1uj8vo,1569771445.0,Thank you. It seems to have passed. That stupid ‚ÄúThis too shall pass‚Äù is right again even if it never helps in the moment.
bipolar2,f1okgzb,t1_f1oka35,1569649166.0,I‚Äôll try that idea tomorrow. They‚Äôre currently sleeping on the couch. Probably smarter to let them cool off first. Thank you for the support!
