AskHistorians,epwufi9,t1_epvu2fw,1559584938.0,"As a fellow microbiologist, I soundly agree with this. The toxin is somewhat designed for mammalian cells - including ours.

There are three main routes of infection, depending on how the victim was exposed - skin (cutaneous), lungs (inhalational) and gut (gastrointestinal).

The toxin is composed three parts - Protective Antigen (PA), Edema Factor (EF), and Lethal Factor (LF). The function of the first one is to protect the last two, allowing the whole thing to enter the cell. It disrupts the cellular signalling pathways, eventually leading to cell death.

The inhalational and gastrointestinal routes have the highest mortalities - but certainly not 100%.

AskHistorians,epsbhge,t1_epqoz36,1559443381.0,Fascinating. I thought the Mongols were pacified by the time the Ming rose to power - they did overthrow the Yuan after all. I didn't know the Yuan dynasty still posed a threat to them by 1444. I just thought they simply became wary of outsiders after the Mongol invasions. TIL. Thanks!
