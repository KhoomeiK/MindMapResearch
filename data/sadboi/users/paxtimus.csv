it sucks you‚Äôre in this position because it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs own choice whether or not to do that with various reasoning for either choice. 

personally i‚Äôd just avoid the topic and avoid her, if you have a manager you trust/will take you seriously maybe talk to them. if you can, try to limit your hours with that coworker (i currently have a coworker i cannot stand who usually works mornings, so i try to limit myself to working later). 

and the answer i find most helpful when it comes to issues at work is this: i come here to work. i do not need to be on good terms with everyone. i‚Äôm not gonna be rude, but if someone dislikes me i just ignore it because it doesn‚Äôt matter. you won‚Äôt work here your whole life anyway, neither will anyone else. so just ride it out and take it day by day doin what you can in the meantime. i try my best to ignore immature adult coworkers because they‚Äôre irrelevant to my life outside of work. 

hope some of that helps :)"
