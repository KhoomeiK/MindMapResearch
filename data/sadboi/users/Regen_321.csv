For me it ended when I was really diagnosed with depression so severe that I was planned to go into a mental hospital.

I avoided hospital because I got a lot of help from professionals and friends. I am still digging myself out of the hole. I almost lost my home because all my money had run out and I didn't care. 

The reason I didn't care? I was a Bad Person and deserving of everything bad that can happen to a person!

You are NOT a bad person! But you are in need of help. Contact your doctor and tell your story. Contact your friends and tell them how you feel. Explain to them that you are such a terrible person that not deserving of there love and attention (watch them get angry and concerned about that statement).

My point is get (professional) help. I know it's difficult, almost impossible, but you can do it. But take it from a survivor: the first step is the hardest, but it gets easier and better.

Don't wait till you have hit rock bottom like I did. Just make the appointment/call your friends and tell them how you feel. You will be surprised how understanding people are. Because your condition is known. 

To put it another way: there's a depressing amount of depressed people out there. The good news: there is treatment, there is help and there is light at the end.

Be safe and get well!"

bipolar,f9ikqrp,t3_e51xut,1575339510.0,"Good for you. Some advice from someone who has been there (and been there, and been there.....). 

Try to keep the flow of your therapy slow but steady. Remember your therapist doesn't know you, nor does s/he know your problems. They will have to figure you and your problems, and they have limited time to do this. Don't expect miracles for the first couple of sessions and don't get frustrated if they don't understand you fully the first time.

What I have done for my current psychologist is print out some Reddit posts where I describe some of my issues from BPD. It might be useful for you to show your therapist this Reddit post to make them understand what emotions/process brought you to them. 

Also (in the future) you might bring extra information to their attention (e.g. diary posts or life charts) to help them to faster develop a feeling for your personality and your trauma(s). But only if they ask for it/indicate that they would be interested. 

Good luck and good health!"

Keep talking your meds, but do indicate your reservations. Discus this also with your fiance and ask his opinion/help. 

Don't try to manage by yourself. Depression is part for the course, but outside help make things so much better than battling it alone.

Stay strong and know that this an aspect of the disease that will eventually will go away with help and treatment. Don't give up and don't fight it alone!"

bipolar,f8kbpwl,t3_e0t7i6,1574609547.0,"This cure ""yourself by believing"" is a hoax perpetrated by people on them self. Note that in churches people often collectively pray for ""the parishioner that has cancer"" for God to intervene and help them get cured. This is because cancer sometimes gets cured.

The parish never prays for ""the parishioner who lost their arm in a lawnmower accident"" for God to help grow that arm back. Because to do so is setting God up for failure... don't wanna do that to the Big Guy...

As for your friends(?) on Facebook, try to make them understand that what they are saying is akin to telling an amputee that they can grow there limb back if only they believe....

(Or just ignore and abandon the discussion entirely. Less satisfying than convincing them of the wrongness of their ideas, but a whole lot faster.....)"

bipolar,f86c38c,t3_dz3whm,1574294652.0,"I know how difficult it can be to reach out to old friends. However there are great upsides. I have been struggling with a allmost year long heavy depression. Whit professional help I am now getting better and also reaching out to friends I avoided fir months. 

These outreaches where very emotionally difficult and I really had to force myself. However they have done me incredible good.  They help me to dispel the mental spidernets that had taken over my mind, just because I hadn't meaningful conversations with people.

So my advice is do try to re-establish contact. The intellectual stimulation can do very good things for you. If you feel strong apprehension/angt about re-establising contacs, just mention this directly to that friend. He will understand and help you reintegred yourself in normal society."

My advice (harch) : save your energy for the moment after he burns out. Do not engage him now as he has sweat talked himself out of the hospital.. (he btw didn't sweet talk himself out of the hospital. He checked himself out of the (German) hospital, and was obliged because ..  well freedom. He didn't fool anybody.)

Advice don't engage him (on the phone) about treatment when he is still manic. Engage him on the phone but just as a friend... Tell him you love him ...

Only engage him about treatment after 1. He crashed and burned and is really committed against his will or 2. He came down naturally (1234 days from now) and he himself wants to talk about treatment..."
