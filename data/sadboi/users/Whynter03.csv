college,ff2qc2o,t3_er72ir,1579519183.0,"100% yes. On my 5th year now. It, along with anxiety continued to get worse every semester, in spite of my constant attempts at better, more effective plans to combat it. End of last semester I finally started working to get some real help. I‚Äôm in counseling now and I‚Äôll be working with a scholastic coach. Next week I meet with my doctor to get on some medication to help the anxiety/depression. Im really hoping for a good semester. It feels like this could be the one

On a side note I‚Äôve found that my anxiety and depression decrease tremendously when I‚Äôm in a working environment. I‚Äôve had a few internships now and my mental health is fantastic when I‚Äôm working. Knowing this helps me a lot because I know I just need to get through school and into the real world. Unfortunately my failures along the way mean I still have a few more years to go..
Oh well, I‚Äôm just doing the best I can. I‚Äôm hoping counseling and medication can help to success 

Here‚Äôs to a good semester! I hope you and anyone else find some things to help you through your journey :) stay strong!"

socialskills,ezahk7f,t1_eza0jx4,1567801606.0,"Thanks for the reply. From what I can tell she‚Äôs in a good place to date and needing space isn‚Äôt the issue. I think it comes down to her actual interest in me and how I play it out moving forward, which is why I‚Äôm anxious about doing it well. 

I think you‚Äôre right about giving it time and taking it one step at a time, when it feels right. But I also need to make sure I keep it moving and don‚Äôt stall if it‚Äôs time to move forward. 

Genuineness seems key. She‚Äôs got a lot of good traits so, even though delivery might be awkward, I think I can do well to compliment her when the time is right. 

What do you mean by me bing fine until she tries to set me up with another dude? Do you mean another girl?

Thanks again! This helps a lot"
socialskills,ezagmff,t1_ez9tu1c,1567801097.0,"That‚Äôs good advice. Thank you! I‚Äôll take that all to heart. 

I‚Äôm still worried that I wasn‚Äôt outright enough with my intentions on this being a date. We‚Äôve never gone out to dinner before but we have done other things as friends in the past. I just want it to be clear that I‚Äôm interested and taking actual steps to move forward rather than this awkward ‚Äúbeating-around-the-bush‚Äù that I‚Äôve done in the past. 
Do you think it would put too much pressure on the situation to send a text clarifying what I meant? Also I might see her this weekend and if I do I am thinking about saying something in person to clarify (though of course I‚Äôm worried about being  awkward with that too..)

Text could be something like ‚Äúhey ___, we talked about dinner earlier. I wanted to clarify that I meant taking you out to dinner as a date‚Äù 
I‚Äôd probably try to word it better than that but that‚Äôs the gist."
