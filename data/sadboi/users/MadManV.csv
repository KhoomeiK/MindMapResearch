BPD,fp2kwna,t3_gat540,1588263516.0,"The hardest thing I ever had to learn, as a man with BPD, was how to manage both my impulsive emotional and physical responses. As people with BPD these were our defense mechanisms for survival for SO LONG and now we have to relearn how to live in order to find happiness. It isn’t exactly easy and things will never been 100% peachy. 

If you need better coping mechanisms the best place to start is meditation and reflection. Mindfulness exercises are a pain to get into but are KEY for people with BPD in managing our symptoms. We’re already so hyper analytical of the world around us but not nearly mindful enough of who we really are, and most times we have no fucking clue who that is. 

Something I do that helps me in a lot of situations is this: out of all the different perspectives and moods that I can shift into without warning, I have formed a singular ideal self that I know I am most often and most naturally without dealing with my symptoms. I reconciled what my ideals and ethics are and solidified that “this is who I REALLY am.” So when I start having difficulties with my emotions or my outlook I say to myself “This isn’t me” and rely on those mindfulness practices to help me identify just how out of the norm I’m acting and what triggered me to enter whatever sorry state I was in. 

One other thing to punctuate this novel lol: BPD isn’t always a curse. Sometimes it can be like a super power. I’ve come to see and understand the world in ways most other people don’t, I have focus and drive that cannot be matched, and I’m able to truly empathize with pretty much everyone. In danger it has saved me on several occasions. It can make me charming and insightful. Hopefully one day I’ll be completely on top of it but I don’t think that will be the case. Just keep trying to get as close to being satisfied with yourself as you can get."

BPD,flsihw6,t3_fqkwd1,1585442886.0,"It always best to be honest about how you’re feeling, especially with those close to you. If it’s negative then it’s important to calmly discuss those negative feelings while understanding, and letting who you’re speaking to know you understand, that those feelings very well may be a symptom of the disorder (this does unfortunately leave room for abusive friends / partners to gaslight you, using your BPD as a scapegoat for their shitty behavior). 

However, I often find that it’s best to keep specific thoughts and unsolicited opinions to myself. Reflecting on what I’m thinking and feeling before speaking on it is the best route to take, but never bottling it up. It starts to fester and that dark side of BPD latches to those things."
BPD,fl25pyr,t3_fm0vty,1584743532.0,"I’m several years in as a wildland firefighter, well recognized and respected in my field. I’m a home owner, a single father who does a pretty good job managing the challenges therein. I’m responsible and I’m making great progress in life. All that said, I still struggle DAILY with the symptoms of BPD. They will never go away and thinking they ever will is going to do you more harm than good. Learn healthy coping mechanisms, practice mindfulness exercises, meditate, and learn to recognize when you’re actually dealing with the symptoms of BPD. There is no “CURE” and honestly I tend to look at my BPD as just a different set of perspectives on life, and that’s one of my coping mechanisms."
BPD,fkfck39,t3_fi06qa,1584131459.0,"This one is weird to me. I dealt with BPD undiagnosed until I was 22 and almost never felt anything but anger and anxiety. Then I smoked for the first time almost a year later and it was like I was finally able to feel happiness and all the other positive emotions in life. I smoked through most of my 20s (32 now) and it kept me level, let me enjoy life and manage my symptoms. I’ve been sober for a while because of my job and I definitely feel more dull, if I can clear medicinal use with my employer I’d start again certain that it will be beneficial to my mental health."
