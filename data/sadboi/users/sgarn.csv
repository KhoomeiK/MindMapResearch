It seems what he calls ""noise"" is simple harmonic motion from the torsion in the copper wire. This is actually a key to the experiment - you need to measure the period of oscillation to get the torsional ""spring"" constant, although it's difficult to tell here because he hasn't measured over several oscillations. Nevertheless, what looks like a period of oscillation of about four or five minutes corresponds to what you might expect for a copper wire of 0.8 mm from copper's shear modulus.

Plug everything in [to the equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment) with even an optimistic separation of about 5 cm, and you get a deflection of about 1.3 mm.
