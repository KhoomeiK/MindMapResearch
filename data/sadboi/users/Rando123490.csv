The last part of the boat ride takes you through a stormy sea and there’s a ton of waves in the room. It always freaked me out to think what was under the waves - which were choppy and loud. I always went to “shark” and I gave myself a few scares whenever a wave would smack against the wall."

LPOTL,fnu9op8,t1_fnu8gya,1587257430.0,"I’m actually sick. I’ve been binging too and saw this and had to pause the show. People around me, people I ONOW - not just numbers in headlines - are dying. Have died by serving others doing their jobs. One was barely 20 and died suddenly from the virus yesterday, and her parents are launching a gofundme for her “send off.” It’s all so fucked. My sister works as an ER Chaplin and I’m scared for her life every day. 

I love the Boys. The show seriously kept me from the edge more than I can count. Just got a shirt and the book. But this is disgusting, truly. Maybe I’m overreacting. but even if this a joke, now is NOT the time. If it’s not ... I’ll keep my harsher words to myself, but will emphasize that his tweets indicate a lapse in judgement that is so profound it’s staggering. I say that as someone who has also taken a major financial hit from the pandemic, so save me the “but the economy!!” Argument because I know. I still believe prematurely reopening everything is a massive and deadly mistake. 

This Seriously wounded how I view him and I’ve made it through the most offensive shit on Roundtable. JFC, Ben.

ETA: I know it seems like he’s been going through it and I have compassion for that. Still troubled by the take regardless. I’m not saying cancel him or fire him or see ya, LPN; some awareness and an apology would be great. If he doubles down ... that, for me, will I form how I personally interact with the show moving forward."

AskMen,fis0tvl,t3_f9do3c,1582675208.0,"Oh yes. Would cry all the time. Insomnia, frequent headaches. Dreaded waking up in the morning. When I was tired, didn’t want to go to bed because that meant I’d have to wake up and go to work. No matter how much I communicated, things never changed or I was blamed for things outside of my control. I worked wyyyh over 40 hours - all nighters were frequent. Job left me poor as hell - that’s a long story - so I was socially and financially isolated in a new city (I’m talking went into debt, got a second job and still couldn’t pay the bills levels of fucked by their reimbursement program for work expenses). My depression was so so bad I could barely function - and the gossiping, back-stabbing and level of pettiness in certain coworkers didn’t help (don’t get me started on how that HR complaint I made was handled!!)

I was given way too much work by angry, uncommunicative bosses and it got to the point where I just kinda ... gave up. Showed up at 9:30, worked in a common area away from my desk, stopped doing stuff in personal time to stay on top of everything. 

The kicker is I got violently ill the last day of my two weeks. I thought it was food poisoning - it ended up being the flu (I’m convinced my body new the hell was over and shut down). I had agreed to do a bit of work over the weekend to catch up when I thought it was just a 24-hour deal, but then I got the emails from three of my bosses (yeah, too many cooks). So harsh and insulting. I said, yknow what, acre this. I’m sick. They wouldn’t take no for an answer. Finally had to emphasize  the no and block their emails. Ugh. A nightmare experience - and not even scratching the surface! - that I can move on from as soon as I get the final expense report cashed by the company."
