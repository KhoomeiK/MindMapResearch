And lately, I've been doing alright again, my county is finally on lockdown, and i'm feeling much better..... That is until I coughed up phlegm just a moment ago, and I can already feel like i'm spiraling into panic mode again.

It always happens to me every year.  


And even though I don't live alone, I don't go anywhere very often, because of my anxiety and a handicap that doesn't allow me to drive.

DayofDragons,fcnb9rt,t1_fcmuh34,1577807920.0,"I know the Dragon Game Project guys uploaded videos. But i think they're two different projects.   


Dragon: The game is already out, but last i heard. It hasn't had an update for a very long time and is abandoned. Where as The Dragon Game Project is still in development.   


But like i said, do keep Dragon: The Game up there. I don't know the state of the game, i've never played. And if it's true that the devese abandoned it. It's probably not a good idea to still be supporting. But if people want something to play now, and want the ""Play as a dragon"" experience D:TG is definitely an option."

But don't take D:TG off the list though, it might be abandoned but even it's state it's probs better than DoD."

DayofDragons,fclyrnf,t3_ehtcau,1577759779.0,"Don't forget about Dragons of the Edge! It's a very early tech demo. But I think it's worthy of a mention. Especially since it's a HTTYD game that isn't a mobile game or MMO.

I will say that one of the aspects of DoD that had me most interested, before Jao showed his true colors that is. Was that it was a game that let you be an animal, no knights, no elves, no wizards what have you. Just Dragons, and other mythical or fantastical animals just being animals in a regular ecosystem. As if they were something that could exist. I know that is one of the very big criticisms of the game. But of all the things that is wrong with the game, i do honestly really like that concept. The idea really reminded me of an old animal planet mockumentary called Dragon's World: a Fantasy made Real, which was a show that portrayed Dragons as normal animals, besides being a massive reptile that can fly and breathe fire. And really explored their evolution and biology. It's a shame there's not really other games like that, and the only one that exists is a dumpster fire.

&#x200B;

Oh well, all these games are interesting enough, even Icy's little project. And while Emberfall still has heavy human involvement. Atleast they are inspiring their dragons off of possible evolutionary body plans, gives them proper Genus / Species names that make sense. And even ecological niches. And that alone has sold me on the project. (Is Icy updating Do'D btw? or was it just something to prove that anyone could do what jao did a lot quicker and that was it?)"

Jao: Continues his rampage of censorship and perma bans against people with basic criticism and pleads for better behavior

Jao might very well be the worst game dev I have personally been involved with. He is awful, and for the sake of the people who let hype dictate their wallets and backed the kickster, I don't want the game to die so they don't have their money wasted, provided it isn't a scam or steam doesn't yeet it off the platform. But I really hope just rage quits his own game like he did his discord and let someone else work on it if he doesn't fix his shitty attitude and immaturity problem."

Is there a list of console commands I can reference? Says there are commands in the game, but I don't know how to access them."
