AskLosAngeles,eq4es2z,t3_bx7wy0,1559775300.0,"Moved here from the Midwest five years ago for a job in healthcare.

I love the weather, being from Wisconsin. I have more energy in the winter than I did in WI. I love being able to escape to nature pretty easily with the San Gabriel monument. I love the skiing and surfing. I always dreamed of learning how to surf before coming here. The weather had such a positive impact on my mental health, I turned down a job back in WI that seemed like a good job.

I love the professional opportunities here; I have moved one time to a better paying job, but I have had multiple opportunities to move jobs. For this reason, my employer treats me pretty well.

Any cultural activity you are interested is here. For example, I lover soccer, and can go to LAFC games after work on the subway. I have seen Barcelona and the USMNT at the Rosebowl. I love the Dodgers. Supposedly there is football in this town too. The food is awesome, and I like the mix of cultures.

Dislikes. Traffic. Live by where you work and play or you will hate your life here. The cost of living is ridiculous. If I didn't earn a decent salary, I don't think I would want to live here. The contrast between the super rich and super poor is really glaring here. In fact, there are places in LA that have me convinced that US society is falling apart.

Choose wisely..."
