You are acting as her convenience, making her life easy, while she continue to act on her insecurities by seeking attention elsewhere while bragging about it. This whole ""relationship"" is about her.

relationship_advice,esacvxu,t3_c6plvd,1561756766.0,"I dont think she is more experienced. You are showing initiative by discussing issues that affect you. On the other hand, she has issues expressing her own opinion. She is a young teen who isnt confident or matured enough to express herself. As a friend first, i would think helping her in that area will take priority over the relationship. 
It's hard to date someone who doesnt know herself, not aware of herself, and doesnt know how to communicate. All these skills are part of life learning journey. At this stage, it's like dating a surprise egg. Once she grow to a stage where she can handle herself and hatch, then you will finally see her true self. And be certain if this person is the one you truly love."

Lesson learned. Set your boundaries clearly. 
Set your deal breakers clearly. 
Dont date men who take your money. Healthy people are financially self sustainable. 
Dont date men who lie. Real relationship builds on trust. 
Dont date men who is involve in vice. The lifestyle  is not physically and mentally healthy. 

No matter how lonely and needy you are, never succumb to these lowlife. You are strong on your own, stronger than having a lowlife like that drag you down. They are like parasites. They dont do you any good. They feed on your insecurities and make you emotionally reliant on them. Truthfully, it's hard to get out of a relationship with them.

sex,esaa7r9,t1_esa8zvr,1561755084.0,"On her lack of physical affection vs your super physical affection, you may wana read up on love languages. It's very clear yours is physical touch. Which means you show love by physical, and you readily accept love expressions in physical way. 
It seems physical touch may be one of her love languages, but clearly not the main one. It means she may be expressing her love in other way, example words - she say she love you. And she receive love readily in form of words. So instead of hearing ur reply in ""i love you"" word format, you went ahead n kiss her. So in her perspective, maybe she isnt receiving the loving expression she wish to have. 
Love languages is a good read to know. So you learn to tweak your love expression to the format your lover readily receive."

sex,esa85wx,t3_c6p2nc,1561753724.0,"It wont be considered unhealthy unless it's affecting your relationship negatively, or it leads to neglect of some other aspects. But since you are in this train of thought, perhaps you feel you are neglecting something? And what would that be?

To see if this is love or lust, you can try to go without for a week(or whatever time length yoi decide to test), and focus on loving actions that are non-lust. Physical touch is a form of expressing love. So to some, being physically intimate shows love and affection. But sex is not the only way to show physical affection. Kiss, hugs, cuddles, holding hands all also show different degree of love expression. Maybe this will give you insight on the type of love(vs lust)?

You also mention you have this desire for her to want you sexually as well. Since your libido is obviously higher, you take initiative most of the time. Why not hold out and try give her a chance to initiate. 
Well, a waiting game of expectations may not be the best thing to do. But no harm trying. Just make sure you don't overthink on expectations. 

Or you can just talk to her about this matter. 
Sometimes showing sexual desire isnt about sex acts. Maybe its more about showing physical affection, or affirming words. Could be actions like playful touches, twirling your hair, caress your bum, whisper in your ear etc. Or words like dirty text, flirt words, complimenting your looks etc. 
If you break the issue down into tiny components like that, it's easier for her to pick up ideas on what she could do."
relationship_advice,esa2dcd,t3_c6o3bu,1561749944.0,"Maybe dont find interest for finding sake?
There so many people out there, and not everyone holds the same interest. 
There's nothing wrong looking around and experimenting. Just be honest and open and true to yourself. 
The more true you are, you will attract people who like you for real. And maybe develop deeper interest."
sex,esa1m48,t3_c6o4ko,1561749443.0,"Well its true you make your demands are clear to have 2-3x and she is trying to fulfil on her end. 
But as a woman with lower libido, probably her turn on is not as lust and physical. Women tend to need more emotional needs met to feel sexy. 
Like am i pretty enough, do i look too bloated pre-period? Having period cramps and aches.  Feel drained from work and chores, tired of dealing with people at work, frustration, sadness from other stuff etc etc. 
With these emotions in the way, its hard to ever feel sexy and being really up for it. 

Offering a listening ear is one of the surerest way to help a woman feel emotionally supported and loved. You can also offer to share her load of chores if she allows you. Sometimes offering romantic dates, massage, gifts, surprises may work, but it's not sustainable for long run. It's more like a bonus, but not so much of helping with root issues. 

The next thing is try to read into her libido. Girls sexy mode run like clockwork based on her menstrual cycle. During ovulation period is the most horny zone. You can catch her during that time and score higher quality sexytime. 

Sometimes, its not the quantity of sex, but the quality of sex. Its not always hour long full course meals. Sometimes elaborate, sometimes quickies. Depending on mood, energy level, time constraints etc. 

I believe if you move your focus of the relationship off sex, and build more loving support foundation, it will feel more rewarding. Sex as a couple should be a constructive relationship building activity, and not a mean to satisfy personal lust."

Floating around as a couple with permanent distance isnt my type. 
Visiting each other across the world is very costly. And due to work leave limitations, its hard to just turn up and spend time with each other. 

Being in this LDR, we get to have personal time to stablise ourselves, like career, character, life routine etc. We get to fulfil everything we want in a singles life, with the loving support of the other. 
So when we finally close the gap, we have no regrets."

SuicideWatch,es2nqud,t1_es2g8qm,1561531425.0,"Second this about being a good listener. I once was suicidal, and my parents are the last to know anything because they are poor listeners. 

Whereas with friends, and unrelated neutral parties, they may not understand the situation but they just listen without judgement. And it helps alot to feel acknowledged about my existence. 

Poor listener parents on the other hand make me seem like im a problem in need to fix. They tell me what i lack, what i need to do, what i shouldnt do. And they keep telling and telling and talking down. Have they ask what i feel? Did they ask why i end up like this? Did they ask what's goin on in my head. Nope. 
It's just them trying to parent, trying to control, trying to fix problems. 
This is just one good way to drive a wedge between parent and child communication. 
The problem here is not the child. 
The problem here is your own methods of showing support. It has not effective and not been well received. 

First take care of your own mental wellbeing. 
And then, just be with your child doing normal things. Holding normal conversations. Integrate her back to normal lifestyle. Try have more one on one hands on activity for bonding time - walks around nature, making art, cooking etc. Try to ask questions to let her talk. Let her lead the conversations. Treat her like an equal, like friends. Like she is a new neighbor that just moved in next door, and rediscover her."

This helps you with other types of relationships as well, with family, friends etc."
LDR,erwvic2,t3_c4ikhh,1561358131.0,"I think is more about the quality of communication. With less time to talk and meetup, its hard to express to each other without small cues like body language and sometimes tone. 

If you two learn to phrase and use more precise words, and sentence structure to dissolve aroused emotions and resolve conflicts, that will help alot to create an environment for open honest communication. 

For example, sometimes when face to face, we argue, shout, pout, snub, look away, frown, put tears and stuff to get attention from our partners.

 On the surface, it may look like a competition to see who wins. But underneath, it could be a plea for the partner to recognise and acknowledge our feelings for a certain issue. 
So instead of engaging in all those arguments, cut the drama, and talk head on for the need of acknowledgement, and tackle the related issue instead. 

With face to face talk, it's easier to get lost in a battle of reactions. So sometimes, it may be more helpful to talk sense on text, where you can have time to think, reread, rephrase and help each other help yourself resolve problems. 

The takeaway here is not about the arguments or having problems. Its about how you two communicate to resolve conflicts."

You may want to have a deep conversation about this. What he actually wants in life, what he wants in this relationship, and how he see the future of this relationship.

I was on medication treatment eversince that day. But they thought its a pop pills and recover kind of thing. So every time they found out I'm heading to the doc, they panic. 

On my own part, i did doctor hunting from clinics to clinics to see who work with me better. And now i stick with one who can attend to me when i needed help. Other government doctors are too swamped and their appointment wait are too long.
