We can't completely close the gate, but it's been narrow so far. But now a lot of people are trying to force the gate open.

We do not have the means to protect ourselves when the virus hits it's Second Wave.

Just because I don't agree with the people who are insane enough to mass protest during a pandemic doesn't mean I don't understand where they're coming from. Life is fucking rough. If you live in a rural community it's even worse, because there are a lot less reliable systems in place. Trust me, I live in a rural community. Things are \*god awful\* out here.

There aren't a lot of businesses to begin with, so when they started closing/shutting down it started hurting us a hell of a lot more. People lost a lot of access to reasonable food supplies, and now some stores are occasionally forced to close down for deep cleaning. Because there's ALWAYS somebody with the virus that ends up infecting a worker or manager by being careless, hurting the rest of us in the progress. And it's even worse for the retail workers that are already being pushed beyond the limits of what they should be expected to handle.

This virus might just kill rural America. Which unfortunately is going to have a pretty stark effect on urban America too, because a lot of the food that is produced is out in the Midwestern rural farming belts out there. If it's bad where I live, there's a good chance it's even worse out there. They were already in terrible shape because of the complicated political situations that were killing their livelihoods and raising their suicide rates.

This can only mean that the event is sometimes rigged to trigger automatically when certain other conditions are met, such as the passage of time. If that's the case, why?

People from other countries clearly still visit and migrate to the United States, even under these terrible conditions. Some of them will get sick.
