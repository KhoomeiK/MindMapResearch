BipolarReddit,fgno1lr,t1_fgnhu39,1580949092.0,I had the exact same thing happen to me. Thought I was having a spiritual awakening and could do telepathy and all this other stuff. Kinda comforting in an odd way to know I‚Äôm not alone in that. Also kinda scary when you get out of it and realize just how far into the psychosis you really got.

I‚Äôm sure it effects everyone differently though, I‚Äôd just be careful not to do it too much and examine yourself to make sure symptoms aren‚Äôt getting worse when you use it"

I also think I can write really well when I‚Äôm manic so I post my writings and they all actually kinda suck?

I don‚Äôt know if this actually had to do with the mania, or something else. I managed to stop with the eating issues though, probably because I was hospitalized and had to eat 3 meals a day, and didn‚Äôt really have an opportunity to purge. I‚Äôd bring it up to your doctor for sure, it‚Äôs better to try to stop it now than to wait"
BipolarReddit,esmbrtt,t3_c6ahmx,1562102155.0,"I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend this, as someone who had her first psychotic break after habitual marijuana use for 3 months. 90% thc is obviously extremely high, as other people are commenting you‚Äôre better off trying something with CBD in it.

BipolarReddit,es4hhji,t3_c5l8xe,1561584947.0,"I feel this so much. I had to take a semester off of university because I got hospitalized for a really bad manic episode. I already started university a year later than most people my age, so now I‚Äôm a year and a half behind. It‚Äôs frustrating and upsetting to watch people of our own age achieving what we perceive to be more than us, but I try to remember everyone‚Äôs journey is different. We do suffer from a fairly severe illness; it‚Äôs okay that if we can‚Äôt do as much as people who are neurotypical. We wouldn‚Äôt judge someone with a physical illness for this right? Why judge ourselves?"
BipolarReddit,ervug5e,t3_c3is6k,1561325324.0,"I used to smoke a lot, like, everyday, and it eventually pushed me into a psychotic break. I‚Äôve had 2 psychiatrists in the past year (had to transition out of one because his practice ends when you turn 21) and they‚Äôve both said to stay away from pot unless I wanna go psychotic again. So for me, it absolutely did not help and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone who is bipolar. I was bipolar for 7 years (type 2) and then my diagnosis changed to type 1 with psychotic features soon after I started smoking a lot. So now I‚Äôm just scared of weed in general lmao. However to each their own!! So I would say it‚Äôs not helpful at all, but I‚Äôve heard some people say it helps them."
BipolarReddit,ervs1hw,t3_c45oxz,1561323605.0,"Yes yes I get this allll the time, it‚Äôs been weighing on me so heavily lately, mainly because it‚Äôs really annoying!! For me the music becomes things, beats, patterns I‚Äôve never heard before. And when I‚Äôm manic I‚Äôll get caught on certain words and incorporate it into the music in my head. Really though it‚Äôs just annoying. It bugs me the most when I‚Äôm trying to sleep and my mind just won‚Äôt quiet down."

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having this experience :( I just remember sitting at home alone some nights and being convinced there were demons/ghosts chasing me. When I had psychosis I thought there was a demon specifically that my ex made chasing me, and I thought that every shadow was this demon. However from like ages 10-19 I dealt with this.

bipolar,eqt9alc,t1_eqt93p4,1560305766.0,oh my gosh. If it makes you feel better I told random strangers that my ex boyfriend was gonna become a serial killer and I had to put him in jail (gotta love delusions- having a full blown manic episode makes me weird)
bipolar,eqt55a3,t1_eqt1vcu,1560302463.0,"ahhhh oh that does not help at all. That‚Äôs frustrating and must be really annoying. I wish I had more impulse control in mania to not overshare but I don‚Äôt (obviously it‚Äôs mania, no insight there) and it kinda sucks because so many people know shit about my life that I don‚Äôt want them to. For example I decided to post on insta that I went into the hospital for 6 weeks for bipolar. Like ok non manic me, why would you do that?? I also had the weirdest delusions and told people about them so that‚Äôs fun too. Manic me should not be allowed to have a cell phone."
bipolar,eqswyuw,t3_bzj3cw,1560296039.0,Is it a bipolar thing to overshare? Like me when I‚Äôm hypomanic will literally advertise on social media that I‚Äôm bipolar. Hypomania/mania makes me tell complete strangers my life story. Anyone else do that?
BipolarReddit,eqsw8ep,t1_eqsuu86,1560295469.0,"Yes, I can see how that‚Äôd be frustrating. Good for you for forgiving them.

BipolarReddit,eqssidb,t1_eqsrpzr,1560292654.0,"Thank you for sharing. I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm obsessing so much, so I gotta stop that. It really is scary, I feel like my mind has betrayed me by putting these false memories there. I began to believe so many things happened to me that didn‚Äôt -and I definitely didn‚Äôt know that was a psychosis thing at first, so I was so convinced these memories were real. Realizing it just makes me feel crazy, because I told friends about what I believed (a lot of them believed me, because my ex was that shitty that they believed was capable of that) so now it‚Äôs awkward having to be like, sorry, that was just my psychosis!! I almost went to the police and told them my exes ‚Äúplan‚Äù, thank God I got a grip on reality before I did that. Ugh. Living with psychosis is hard. Thanks so much for sharing your experience, it‚Äôs nice to know I‚Äôm not alone :)"
BipolarReddit,eqqoppp,t1_eqqkrqf,1560226989.0,"It‚Äôs nice to at least hear you say you‚Äôve been able to get over them before. I was diagnosed type 2 at 14 and just had my first full blown manic episode which ended in hospitalization and a change of my diagnosis - so this is the first time I‚Äôve gone psychotic and completely manic and the memories won‚Äôt stop. I know how awful the meds can be but yes stay medicated if you can. Psychosis is the most terrifying/crappy thing I‚Äôve been through and it made me act like I was insane, I was telling everyone I was a virgin sacrifice and that people took my blood as a child - and had realllyyy disturbing delusions that I shared with people I barely knew (thinking they were real of course). So, I totally understand ruminating. I think the worst part is I‚Äôll probably never see some of the people who witnessed my psychosis again so why am I so worried about what happened? Ugh. Gotta love mania!!!!"
BipolarReddit,eqqjckr,t1_eqqitg2,1560222565.0,"Trust me, you‚Äôre not!! It‚Äôs a really terrible feeling, and I don‚Äôt know how we can make it stop :("
BipolarReddit,eqqi41y,t3_byzp8q,1560221643.0,"I‚Äôve had this exact same problem lately. No matter what my mind always comes back to the stupid, embarrassing things I did when I was manic. I lost multiple friends who all told me I was crazy - so I think about what led up to that the most. I might not have any great advice but just wanted to let you know you‚Äôre not alone"
