Your life may feel like it's falling a part, but perhaps your just becoming keenly aware of the fragility and impermanence of it all and that realization isn't shared by your immediate social group.

It means that perhaps you are poking around trying to find ways that actually give you reasons to live. And maybe helping  the homeless isn't it for you.

I ask the question not because you should have some deep burning passion for something in life, but to inquire about what do you actually want out of life? Not the stereotypical answer like solve world hunger or travel the world. But you as a human, what feeds your soul? What do you do when you feel most alive or like life is worth living? It could be drawing, computer games, cards, sand art, whatever!! This question is intended for you to take responsibility for making decisions that fill you up as a person, that fill up your cup of life. You don't need to have an answer, but maybe if you keep asking yourself that question, something will emerge. Don't feel a need to answer, maybe just asking yourself 'what do i want to get out of my life' is all you need to do now, for the next few weeks, months, or years. I promise, an answer will emerge...even if that answer is ""nothing"" - because if that really is the answer, then you are free from all of your concerns and worries and everything you've said about your complaints is untrue and you are free to live uninhibited. Get real with yourself about what you care about."

If I am making this right hand turn and a cool car goes by on the left and I turn my head, even without knowing, my bike with start to veer to the left into oncoming traffic. You go where you look. Same in life, you go where you look. look through the turn, even if it feels unnatural or unusual. Look through the pain to the next thing, don't bother to fixate on it because you will go toward it.

Nobody is going to do it for you, nobody is going to create the conditions around you in which you suddenly feel ok being who you are or expressing a certain side of you.

Chances are you've learned that somewhere from someone who bullied/traumatized/convinced you it's true. Because it's definitely not, you have to re-write that internal narrative and not let the self destructive thoughts win out.  Start small 'I am not the dumbest person in the room' - repeat it 100 times a day, then 1000 and tell me what happens.  When you can let go of that thought and build yourself up and deploy your skills and gifts, you will see and feel why your existence isn't needed...but right now, you are not letting yourself see that.

It served you in the past. Sounds like it doesn't serve you anymore, so grow and find something else that gives you that security, or, stop looking for that false sense of security anyway and let go of the need for the beachhead and live free of the self-created shackle, or shackle yourself to a good reason to live - your call!"

Even getting a diagnosis doesn't guarantee anything will substantively change in your life, with or without meds - they help some people and not others. The only thing that's constant in life is you and your commitment to yourself & life. Nothing outside of you will change that. Getting a job, relationships, money, social status, whatever else can contribute to your willingness to give yourself credit for living a life worth living, but even still it's not guaranteed, you are in the driver seat for your quality of life and the sooner you take responsibility and make action the faster you'll accomplish all of those things that you've said you want to!
