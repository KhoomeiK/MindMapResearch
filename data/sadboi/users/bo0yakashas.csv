bootyseunghee,faiy086,t1_faa9789,1576119336.0,yeah whenever you try to help this dumb bitch she gets offended. She is slightly messed in the head and gets worked up over dumb things. Also used to give suicide threats.
mentalhealth,f4hh7u1,t3_dkgcw0,1571591530.0,That is strong of you. It's people like you that help wrecks like me still have some lingering hope of keeping it together. You're a motivation to many who went on the same road as you.
mentalhealth,f49eq4m,t1_f3y18e2,1571463900.0,i live in a shitty country filled with muslims. Therapists here are wrong in the head. Two of them told me i am depressed cause i have left religion. How i need to start believing in god again...Secondly i am tired of taking their medication. All it does it try to make me sleepy or numb.
mentalhealth,f3y0840,t3_dijt4y,1571246639.0,"yeah.. It is. Though a 3 weeks ago. My girlfriend of 1 year who also suffered from depression, we had a good run and in the beginning she had a bad phase due to some fucked up stuff going on at her home. She tried to kick me away but i still stood by her side and took all her rage and fits she took out on me out of frustration. But then came a phase when things between us got good. We were happy with each other's presence. It was like i would be able to ignore what was bringing me down and could laugh and fool around with her.   


 3 months back, shit started going bad for me again at my place. I was in a bad place and all i could talk about were the issues i was having at home between my sister and my parents. My sister is a narcissistic sociopath and the amount of shit my parents and i get from her is immeasurable. Anyway so yeah i hit my phase and it got really bad and i would at times get angry and say some twisted stuff. Stuff either about ending myself or doing something uncalled for to my sister. But instead of staying by my side, she in return started to distance herself from me, avoided meeting me when i was craving to see her again. Didn't give the same amount of time that i gave her.   


I got fed up and called it off but that move just made me miss her more since i couldn't forget about the good days i had with her. This girl completed me cause i felt like i had bumped into a female version of myself. All the jokes and messed up humor she shared with me, i'd be high on laughter and even quit smoking up or drinking. Even though it got hard for us to meet up since we lived far away from each other in the same city and she had some issues at home due to which it was risky for her to come see me very often. I loved her a lot and after knowing what she has went through and still goes through, i didn't want to leave her side. Even after my break up i wanted to look out for her still. Before my break up i manged to hook her up with a nice job and also helped her out with her education since now she will finally be able to enter a university.  Yet she left me alone, even two days back i begged her to come back to me but she told me she won't and that i shouldn't contact her any more.   


I've realized not everyone comes back to you with their arms wide open. Matter of fact in my case no one has ever come back to me or even thought about checking up on me. And i will boldly say that, with women every time when i have invited there issues in my life out of being selfless so that they don't feel alone in their struggles and can rely on me, the favor is never returned as women start seeing me as another addition to their problems and instead look for potential men to escape their problems with instead of seeing someone else who deals with depression. Not a day goes by when i don't think about ending myself or doing something messed up. Even on reddit rn a post as small as yours gets so much attention while  i wrote my whole story on the verge of committing suicide or something else on this subreddit, no one reached out to me. It's like i don't exist. I feel like i will actually end myself soon."
