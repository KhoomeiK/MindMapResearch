BipolarReddit,fqqkbik,t3_gkdqn9,1589567021.0,"I think the answer depends on why you’re asking this question.

Are you asking because you’re on a medication (like Lithium, Wellbutrin, etc.) that requires you not to drink alcohol?

Or are you asking because you’re afraid it will trigger an episode?

My answer: I take Wellbutrin and alcohol can cause seizures with this medication so I try to rarely drink and if I do I set my limits. I never drink when I feel depressed because I know it’ll send me deeper into that depression. I also won’t drink for at least a week after an episode is over, for safe measures. When I’m manic my fiancé lets me know but I rarely believe him, he always convinces me to at least stay home if I want to drink, that way I minimize the possible damage I can cause in my life."

BipolarSOs,f9hd9hi,t1_f9gjh8c,1575313204.0,"I’m Canadian so I’m not sure what 302 means. Honestly, as someone with BP I can say that he will probably not be too thrilled about the idea of being hospitalized when it’s brought up by anyone other then himself. Earlier this year while my spouse was away, a good friend of mine called an ambulance on me after I had admitted to taking a handful of my pills. I was so mad at her for the longest time. Looking back now I’m actually quite thankful to have such caring people in my life. Suicidal ideation should never be taken lightly, however, a hospital probably won’t commit him unless he admits to having an actual suicidal plan. But maybe you could explain to the doctors that even if he doesn’t have a plan, while manic he’s making poor choices that could lead to an accidental suicide; like taking too many pills and along with too much alcohol. It also can’t hurt to tell them that you have kids at home. 

My father is bp1 and growing up I saw/heard a lot of traumatic things. You need to put their safety first, but at the same time getting him help is still putting him first too and you can remind him of that. Maybe when your husband is in a more stable place you could get him to read the book as well, it can’t hurt for him to know what you go through too. You’re both struggling with his disorder just in different ways. 

If you have any questions or just need support and to chat please feel free to private msg me at any time. I’ve been going through this illness since I was 12, I’m 33 now. Like I’ve said, I’ve also witnessed what it’s like to be the child of someone with BP. My bf and I have read a lot and gone through nearly every possible treatment method.

EDanonymemes,f87ys7m,t1_f86usai,1574345328.0,"I live in Ontario and visit Quebec quite a bit, family there. Also, do most my shopping on Amazon lol

I’m terrible at understanding grams lol could you post a picture of a cookie or a link to one? 

Sorry for the hassle. 80-100 calories is just a lot for me too cave into for a snack that isn’t necessarily nutritious and I’m only eating for pure want. I need to make sure it’ll feel “worth it” before buying/eating. I don’t want that anxiety/regret afterwards, that’s the worst possible ED feeling! If it’s large enough for 80-100 calories then I can justify eating it despite it not offering my body the sufficient nutrition/fuel it needs."
EDRecovery_public,f87xyoj,t1_f86rt1w,1574344845.0,"I have a certificate in nutrition, but my bf has already mentioned that I should see a nutritionalist because my brain can’t comprehend my advice for others right now. It twists the truth to fit my ED behaviours somehow. It’s messed up cause I know the truth... I’m pretty sure the psychotherapist I’ll be seeing has a nutritionalist/dietician at that office as well, it’s an office specialized in EDs. I’m interested in your PDFs though. My first appointment isn’t until Monday and I’m a control freak so I’d like to get ahead of the game lol. I’ll msg you my email if that’s okay. :)"
EDAnonymous,f86qtt7,t3_dzcngo,1574304681.0,33f with bipolar1 and anorexia here. I don’t have ED anxiety or thoughts when manic but the mania definitely makes me lose my appetite and forget to eat. When I actually take my anti-psychotics and mood stabilizers the ED isn’t as bad...like the thoughts/anxiety are there but I binge eat. Obviously this is why I don’t take them...

EDanonymemes,f84w8e0,t3_dz051i,1574262196.0,"Lol damn motivational quotes hitting our ED minds where it hurts the most!

The other day I logged into my Instagram and say a post that said “you didn’t come this far to quit now”. I stared at it for like a minute straight wanting to cry (my bf and I were discussing starting recovery that night). I dumbass took a screenshot of the post and now I’m fuelled to keep going, maybe harder. Gotta think about how badly I wanted to be a skinny legend when I started, can’t let the old fat version of me down!"

EDanonymemes,f84vq87,t3_dyx288,1574261857.0,"I see your sister and I raise you my mother. 

I know it’s not a competition on who has it worse, I’m kidding here. But seriously I’m 33 and my entire life my mother acts like our weights are a competition. We’re the same height but we don’t have the same body shape at all even at the same weight. It killed me as a teenager that my mom looked skinnier than I did at the same weight. Now that I’m an adult I can just be sad for her that she lives that way. 

My struggles are exactly that, mine and I don’t want to ever judge anyone else’s body. It does bother me a bit that my m can’t see how unhealthy her mentality is, that she did this to me and that she should want more/better for her child."

EDAnonymous,f84v5dc,t3_dyz80c,1574261466.0,"I buy I super cheap protein powder that’s sweetened with stevia so it’s only 110calories for 25g protein. I can drink one after my workout and a second one as a late night snack which gives me a total of 50g of protein for only 220calories. 

I’m bad and usually add a cup of unsweetened almond mild as well which is another 30cal but you don’t have to."
