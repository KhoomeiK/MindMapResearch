1. Figuring out how to afford college
2. Feelings of immense loneliness and anxiety in college. 

I'm lower-middle class and I attend a school where the top 20% make up about 80% of the student body, so it's hard trying to socialize with the majority of students when they want to eat out all the time and party. 

As for the latter, though I've made friends here that I consider to be even closer to than the ones in high school, going to college has made me realize how unique everyone is and how I will probably not find a best friend until very later in life merely because how everyone is different. Also, the fact that I'm completely independent (even financially as I paid for what was left after scholarship), and I am the sole person that has responsibility over my ""destiny.""
