unpopularopinion,fq2zjp0,t1_fq2ou6s,1589061638.0,"Alright; it‚Äôs obvious we see this differently but there‚Äôs no need to be rude or belittling about it. I consider myself a feminist because I believe we must struggle for women‚Äôs rights on the basis of equality of the sexes and have done a fair bit of study of theory myself. Are you really going to accuse me of living in an echo chamber for associating the term ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù with feminism when feminists today use it all the time? I would love to have a productive and respectful conversation but it seems like you‚Äôre just grasping at straws to invalidate what I said without really addressing the central point I was trying to make.

By your logic it would seem then that no one has an excuse to be ignorant of anything on the internet? Or is it just things related to gender/racial/social equality? Where exactly do we draw the line around what is expected of others versus what we can do to help share and educate and improve communication?

Depending on where you live and the context and values you were raised with, it can be difficult to separate the idea that some masculinities are toxic from the idea that masculinity, full stop, is problematic. I think it‚Äôs a really simple misunderstanding and we could avoid a lot of resistance and bad feeling by being more precise with language. Whether it was invented by a men‚Äôs group doesn‚Äôt seem all that relevant to me. 

The things people happen to look up tend to be retroactive, like you hear a phrase a few times and go search it up to understand it better. There are 1,000,001 things we could get angry at each other for not knowing simply because we could have looked it up before.

I think the solution that will get more people to jump on board with interrogating certain aspects of masculine gender roles as toxic starts with meeting people where they‚Äôre at, not blaming them for not knowing a specific term that sounds vaguely accusatory without context. 

And I think we should listen to people when they tell us how language affects them, lots of men say they find this term problematic, which is why I used the ‚Äúniggard‚Äù example - the term doesn‚Äôt have any racialized official definition, but it‚Äôs hard to hear that word as an English speaker without making the association to the racial slur. I think people still have a right to have a racial-equality based opposition to the use of that word because of that association.

Ultimately, I do my best to have a positive, non-toxic masculinity and do what I can to help others find that path. I imagine you probably do what you can to further the cause of gender/sex equality yourself. We‚Äôre both fighting for the same thing and simply disagreeing about the language we use while we pursue that goal, so I hope we can proceed without resorting to denigrating one another."

unpopularopinion,fq2cjnu,t1_fq283n9,1589054835.0,"Well, as others have pointed out above I think the choice of phrase is very unfortunate and makes many men feel accused simply for identifying as male/masculine. I think you actually give a really good example in your post of a small language change that could really help people relate to the idea better: ‚Äútoxic ideas of masculinity,‚Äù because this phrase is more explicit in identifying that there are plenty of non-toxic ideas of masculinity.

I think when a lot of men hear ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù they hear ‚Äúall men are toxic,‚Äù and honestly I don‚Äôt think anyone should be blamed for this interpretation, because unless you‚Äôve had someone explain the feminist theory behind it to you it‚Äôs an opaque term and it‚Äôs hard not to feel insulted by it.

You‚Äôre using pretty aggressive language in your post, cursing and caps, because you‚Äôre obviously frustrated that whoever you‚Äôre communicating with disagrees with you/doesn‚Äôt quite understand where you‚Äôre coming from. Doesn‚Äôt the person you‚Äôre talking to deserve compassion and understanding, at least to be listened to if they say hearing ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù all the time hurts their feelings?

Perhaps this is an extreme example and feel free to refute it, but consider the very old insult ‚Äúniggard,‚Äù which literally means ‚Äúa stingy or ungenerous person.‚Äù If you were black and someone called you that, I imagine that how it sounds similar to the racial slur n-word would impact your interpretation of it.

I‚Äôd recommend waiting til the end of the week when you have a couple days off, then planning some kind of outing/activity/project for those days to help occupy and distract you.

Go back and read your criticisms of the article and my refutations. You claimed the article had only 4 authors (it doesn‚Äôt) and included some BIG TEXT ABOUT REMDESIVIR which this article does not investigate.

If you were a doctor or scientist you would know that anecdotal evidence is highly suspect, and without rigorous testing can produce skewed perceptions of reality.

Furthermore, you‚Äôre making a straw man argument that this study somehow claims HCQ is dangerous and causes more deaths. THIS IS NOT WHAT IT SAYS. It says HCQ has no measurable BENEFIT, but does not increase mortality.

You‚Äôre right that this study is not perfectly designed, but I would disagree that it‚Äôs findings are invalid. We‚Äôre working with a real-world virus and can only observe people after the fact, not design a perfect experiment. So generally it‚Äôs gonna be the older and sicker patients who try medications that are not yet indicated for their particular ailment. This study looks at patient outcomes after the fact and does its best to compensate for the imbalance by excluding a number of individuals who are outliers.

However, just because they study groups are not perfectly identical here doesn‚Äôt mean the conclusions are invalid, and the study isn‚Äôt hawking Remdesivir. It‚Äôs simply observing that across the cases measured, even taking into account the higher potential mortality of  people with comorbidities, HCQ does not appear to significantly improve outcomes.

That experience includes many of the harms identified in this post, but like you I‚Äôve known about them for a long time and just never felt ‚Äúready.‚Äù

Well, I count myself among the lucky ones who hasn‚Äôt hit rock bottom, but it definitely took me staring at the possibility of a significant failure to really kick my ass in gear. And it still isn‚Äôt easy, I‚Äôm just starting and this day was already hard. 

But one of the things that really made it click was realizing just how difficult (mentally/emotionally) simple tasks and sustained focus have become. I struggle to do anything that‚Äôs not highly engaging for more than 15-20 min, and that‚Äôs no way to read a book or learn a skill.

One thing I‚Äôve been using to keep me grounded is my guitar. I used to be much better than I am now but I always thought I should practice more even when I was younger and taking lessons. Since that time I have felt shame whenever I look at my instrument because of how little I played it. Now whenever I get and urge to smoke I‚Äôve told myself I‚Äôm just gonna pick up the guitar and fiddle for a bit. It might not fix the problem every time, but at least for today it gave me something to focus on and feel proud of rather than turning to my crutch of smoking pot at the slightest obstacle."

It‚Äôs easier to say I am x-er (smarter, faster, more understanding, whatever) THAN someone else, than it is to simply look into myself without comparison and find some truth. Sounds like we need to meditate more?"

They evolved a clear window on top of the plant to let light in, and they line the inner surface with photosynthetic tissue. But the crazy part is - this morphology/strategy has evolved MULTIPLE TIMES INDEPENDENTLY from plant lineages that started with regular old leaves.

HowieHoes,fp4f995,t1_fp48vk2,1588297782.0,"I was a Democrat and worked with Democrats for a long time. There are still a lot of good people that call themselves Democrats. But this harm reduction strategy is the only argument the Democrats have going for them not just this election - but so many elections going back. Even Obama, who excited to many people with the promise of something fresh and new, ended up continuing along a destructive path of foreign, economic, and environmental policy that merely set the table for Trump to tear down.

Getting Biden is not a victory. It‚Äôs not even harm reduction at this point. The corporate wing that controls the Democratic Party is fully OK with sending earth to hell in a hand basket by making no meaningful effort to combat carbon emissions, has been complicit in the dismantling of social programs and union labor, cheerleaders for bloody wars around the world.... the list goes on. Not to mention Joe Biden is a rapist.

The time is now to vote green. The corporatist parties have held a stranglehold on our politics for too long. Enough voters are disaffected that we could actually hit the 5% threshold to qualify for federal funding and begin to build a people‚Äôs movement to wrest control of the levers of power from the people who operate them now to the suffering of millions."
HowieHoes,fp42vtm,t1_fp4164j,1588290610.0,"The Democrats‚Äô dismissal of legitimate grievances from the left wing is the same hubris of this corporatist party that has betrayed its principles and surely lost itself 2 elections now with the presumptive nomination of Joe Biden.

The meaning I ascribe to this meme is that usually when Democrats pretend to compromise/find common ground with Republicans, it‚Äôs usually just that the Democrats have caved to the Republican position. You have ascribed other meaning to this based on your prejudices, and decided that any criticism of the Democratic Party is unacceptable because it helps Trump win.

You are thinking in a way that is elitist in that you deny and dismiss the legitimate grievances of working class people, and servile in that the only way you can envision ‚Äúwinning‚Äù is by falling in line, shutting up, and voting without thought or criticism like Republicans do. 

This is fundamentally Anti-Democratic because the range of acceptable political expression has been compressed to a tiny sliver that represents the interests of the ruling class.

SandersForPresident,fp2zspg,t1_fp2yv10,1588270652.0,"It‚Äôs sad but for me the line I crossed was one of losing hope that the Democrats actually represent a meaningfully better path than Republicans for working people. Many individual Democrats have done good work to that effect on a smaller scale, sure, but the party‚Äôs power structure is fundamentally resistant to takeover by popular means and is beholden to corporate interests as evidenced by the wholesale rejection of such basic and broadly-appealing policies as a Green New Deal and Medicare for All.

I voted for Jill Stein in 2016 and felt conflicted about it because while I didn‚Äôt live in a swing state, Trump won and it‚Äôs hard to separate yourself from the liberal shaming propaganda that it‚Äôs the Green Party‚Äôs fault when they lose. Now I will be proudly campaigning and voting for the Green Party nominee because the argument of voting D as a harm reduction strategy simply doesn‚Äôt hold any water."

I‚Äôll say it again - Your intellectually bankrupt tactic of calling any criticism of Democrats ‚ÄúRussian Propaganda‚Äù is evidence of the fact you have no desire to engage in any kind of meaningful political discourse with those who critique you from the left, is a losing strategy in 2020 just like in 2016, and is blatantly false. 
This image was produced by a machine learning algorithm that aggregates memes of a given format and predicts new ones. This came up and I posted it because it rang true to me.

I am an American citizen who organizes workers in my community and engages in politics critically with people I both agree and disagree with. You on the other hand appear to be incapable of doing so without assuming bad faith.
Your position is simultaneously elitist because it denigrates working class politics, and servile because your entire political worldview is handed down to you from a disconnected political class without question or critique.

To come out and decry this image as ‚Äúracist‚Äù is just intellectual cowardice. Like other liberals, you‚Äôre too scared to actually discursively struggle with race as it functions in our society."
