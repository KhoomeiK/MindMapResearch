I just feel like many people are using this video as ‚Äúproof‚Äù that we indeed should re-open the economy without taking into consideration the bias that could play into the words of these doctors.

There are people dying and there are millions of people infected with this virus. I don‚Äôt believe the virus is causing hearts to explode and I do believe that the numbers are seriously inflated. But who can we even believe at this point? It‚Äôs not these guys.

Ask in your community if there are people that you or your close friends PERSONALLY know who are suffering AND tested positive. So far in my community, there‚Äôs been only one family I‚Äôve heard of where it ripped through them - but not any more serious than if they all got mono. Do your own research and don‚Äôt take these random money makers as your source of truth."

moving,fjnfrks,t3_fee514,1583506387.0,"Rent/mortgage is ridiculous in CA compared to a lot of other states if you want to live within 30-45 minutes to the beach. And you can‚Äôt just move here without a job if you want to find your own place, unless you have schooling set up or have family/friends to stay with.

Traffic can be horrendous in most places, especially on the 5 and the 405 (language is different, see the ‚Äúthe‚Äù before the freeway)

From what I‚Äôve seen, your best bet would be to move to a smaller upcoming city in CA. Maybe Sacramento? It‚Äôs beautiful there and less expensive than SF, LA, or SD. Close to lakes and mountains, but far from the beach. A million great places to drive to though.

CA has some hidden gems in smaller counties, especially if you like to be outdoors. Do some research and you might find your spot. If you want to pay under $1500 in rent, stay away from the major cities."

I wrote her a letter last year telling her how she made me feel and she didn‚Äôt even ask me about it or really apologize. Not that it would help because I don‚Äôt really want to see her anyways. She stopped reaching out but complained to my father and husband how I don‚Äôt give her enough time. As soon as I started talking to her again, it was the same old same old guilt trips.

Life growing up with her has always been about her and her needs. I think I need time to figure out my own needs and some time away from her soul-sucking antics. I blocked her phone again today.
