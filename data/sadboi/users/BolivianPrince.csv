It did void out the older script with the low dose, however. I'm in Ontario, Canada so I don't know if it's different.

lexapro,fc5us03,t3_eg9q9c,1577466357.0,"Escitalopram (Cipralex/Lexapro) has saved my life. I was admitted to a hospital when I was very suicidal, and I started the medication the first night I was there. I started on 10mg, but my depression didn't go away so the doctor doubled it to 20mg (max dose). And that really saved me. Yes, of course there were side effects and they didn't last that long - maybe up to two weeks max. Once they subsided, after the two week mark I noticed a big change in my personality, and not necessarily for the better. It was like I couldn't feel anything, I was a numb shell of a human that didn't experience any emotions. No pain which I like since I'd rather feel numb and blunted, than wanting to kill myself. When people say antidepressants don't change your personality they either are lying and don't know what they're talking about, because they totally do. My anxiety was nearly gone, I could approach people with no issues, I am more outgoing, sociable, way less neurotic, and things that used to bother me don't anymore. It's like wearing armour. The pill makes you focus on things that matter to you, and if someone or something happens to you that should effect you negatively - you simply move on like it doesn't even phase you. You start to not give a shit about all the negative things around you. Yes, I did become apathetic but not entirely because I was depressed- more so it's just that I can't be bothered to care about certain things because they're not in my control. How these drugs saved my life, but I don't think I will be on them for life since they are NOT designed to be taken for long periods. They're designed for as a short term treatment to help the individual overcome a very depressive episode. I have been on 5 drugs for two years, and finally I stopped taking two. One was an injection every three months that was so sedating I couldn't do anything, and another was originally for ADHD - I now take vyvanse which works way better. Remember, you can't take pills and expect them to be a miracle worker. You, the patient, must put in the effort to feel better too. Go to talk therapy, do cbt, talk with those who you can trust and that are closest to you.  
Antidepressants like Lexapro/Cipralex are not a fix-all solution. They are just another aid like therapy to help the individual get through a difficult time in their lives."

ADHD,f5n0iiv,t3_dodxa8,1572295513.0,"Do you take it monday-friday? If so, that's 5 days in a row of being on lisdexamfetamine - a hardcore stimulant. And then when your body doesn't receive the dose, you may experience withdrawal and a comedown. This is normal with prolonged use. 

Being depressed is a sign of a comedown, as with headaches, fatigue, agitation, easy to anger, etc. This is normal. I don't take my vyvanse everyday, and usually about 3-4 days a week I use it. I don't really experience a comedown other than getting tired when it starts to wear off but it's perfect because that's my bedtime. For sure talk to your doctor, but if you still want to be on vyvanse I would suggest not telling him or her how you feel when you're off of it. Because he or she may discontinue it. But I am NOT an expert. Plus, it's always good to be honest with your doctor. If you're wanting a dose increase, ask if that will help.

If you're thinking of trying adderall - the comedown is much worse, and the withdrawals are insane. Especially if you take it for a long period of time. Withdrawals usually start with fatigue, then headaches/migraines, then low mood and discouragement. So do your research before you want to go on a new med. 

My questions to you are:
1. For how long would you say the effects of the medication last? 7 hours? 9? 10? Vyvanse is designed to work for 12-14 hours.
2. Do you think you'll benefit from a higher dose? Remember, the bigger the dose, the stronger the comedown. 
3. What do you want to do with this issue? Dose increase? Try a new medication? Take it later in the day?

I'm asking you these because it's important to know what you're going to talk about with your doc, and I'm just preparing you."

I do stay productive and focused for the entire day - yes. And I take 50mg. And I don't take it everyday, only days I really need it like being at work or during class at university. Vyvanse is about 78 dollars for 30 capsules; so it's expensive. That's why I don't take it everyday, gotta conserve! Hope this helps"

So, what do you do to battle the withdrawals? Use other stimulants. Cigarettes and coffee are very popular amongst ADHD medication users. Of course, smoking is not healthy, so don't start an addiction to help cure cravings of another. Drink coffee, as caffeine is a stimulant.

I think this is dependence on the drug. What I do is take it only when I need to, and take days off when I don’t need it. It makes you less dependent on the drug.

In Canada there is almost always a generic version of the drug. I’m on Vyvanse and unfortunately there is only Vyvanse and no generic lisdexamfetamine. So it’s quite expensive. 

Since it’s so expensive my doctor switched me to extended release methylphenidate but the side effects were bad. I was on 54mg. So I went back to Vyvanse. Since you’re on 18mg, and you take it once a day, I’m certain the side effects won’t be that bad. As your body adjusts to the medication, they will subside. If they don’t, talk to your doctor.

ADHD,eqk8xku,t3_byo16v,1560118009.0,"I was on 50mg and I was perfectly fine. I recently got switched to Concerta and the side effects are shit and it doesn’t work. And for this medication my heart rate does increase. It didn’t on vyvanse. Interesting. 

If you are truly worried them talk to your doctor. Your dose could be too high, or maybe you will need to try Concerta again. Stimulants rase the heart rate, and therefore you know it’s working. Taking anti-anxiety quick release pills will slow down your heart. But also make you a zombie that’s dumb as a stump. So beware. Pharmaceuticals are interesting"
Drugs,eqk7u0q,t3_byo5ws,1560117471.0,"I would say it somewhat stops the pleasure/euphoria. When I did it I didn’t feel a thing, but I was also on anti-psychotics which kill the stimulant high"
gay,eqk639x,t3_byoaeu,1560116727.0,There was a chat for stimulants and drugs in general. I can’t find them and I got banned from one so who knows. There is one I can join but you have to be G rated and keep t work friendly. #boring
ADHD,eqk2rrc,t3_byoz94,1560115233.0,"This is definitely something that you can talk about with you doctor. Most of it sounds like symptoms/habits of someone who has ADHD. Always be honest with your doctor, because that’s he best way they’ll treat and help you. Don’t mention medication, though. This might throw him or her off and they may start to think you’re only saying this because you want drugs. Since most ADHD medications are controlled substances."
gay,eqk24ip,t3_byp2ew,1560114951.0,"Do you see yourself falling in love with and being with a person of the same gender? If so, you could be gay. There is also what the other comment said: exclusive attraction and to the same gender. Nothing wrong with being gay, bi, straight, or questioning. The point of the pride flag is to show that we are all different but united. If you’re asking this question to yourself then just let life take you where you want to be. Who cares what people think, and just do you. It’s your life - be the master of it."

ADHD,eqibgja,t3_byjjwh,1560083543.0,"Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug (Vyvanse) and can only be activated one metabolized by the body to convert it into amphetamines. The other is an ingredient found in adderall, and it is already in an active form. The reason they try to make it only active once taken orally is to prevent abuse"
ADHD,eqib7e7,t3_byjl7o,1560083386.0,"Hey, I am on Wellbutrin 300mg. I’ve stopped before and then started with no issues. If you haven’t had a change in any other medication, then I would say it’s fine. Just try to stay on top of it because withdrawal is a bitch"
ADHD,eq9wg1d,t3_bxv39w,1559919530.0,"That’s strange. You should experience a little to no crash with Vyvanse. It lasts up to 14 hours so take it maybe right when you are about to start your day/work. Takes 1.5-2 hours to kick in. 

How long have you been taking the medication? I’ve took vyvanse for a while and it was the best for me. Kept me productive the entire day. Pity do you dude. Now I’m on a generic brand of Concerta (don’t take it) and it’s awful. I wish there was a generic version of vyvanse because it is so expensive!"

ADHD,epv9z0e,t3_bw53z1,1559528061.0,"You could list the reasons why you think you have ADD, this way when you meet with a psychiatrist you will have some reasons memorized, and to talk about. I think trying to talk to your doctor is a good start, maybe that way he can refer you? That’s how it start with me. If you’re not comfortable doing that, set up a psychiatrist appointment and see what they can do. Just be honest, it’s best thing to do. Also maybe if the continue to talk about it suggest to your doctor some treatment options you’re interested in. Like therapy and medication. Just therapy, or whatever you can think up. 

Hope this helps"
adderall,ep32ta2,t3_btugmu,1559016079.0,"Dude you’re not alone lol. This happens to me all the time. I take vyvanse and that lasts 12-14 hours. On days I decide I won’t take it, I take 5 hour naps and am extremely lethargic. It’s stimulant withdrawal and is normal if you don’t take your meds all the time."

dxm,ep305ad,t3_btursx,1559015077.0,"For tripping dosage. There is a general guideline to what plateau you’ll get to. But weight matters. I would say try for 250ml to 300ml. This will get you to the second plateau. For the first time doing dxm. It isn’t what you expect so hold on for the ride. Get your set up ready because you might not be able to walk. A bed is a good place to trip. 

When compared to weed, it is very different in my opinion. Weed for me gives me slight euphoria and a nice feeling of bliss. I do get the munchies while on weed and I love to listen to music. DXM will fuck you up in different ways. In my opinion, it’s more intense than weed. You can hallucinate on DXM and it’s likely you’ll loose track of time. You will dissociate and maybe feel like you’re watching yourself do whatever it is you’re actually doing. Hard to explain. 

You may feel derealization and depersonalization the day after but this will go away."
