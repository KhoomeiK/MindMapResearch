You want to find answers about yourself and know yourself better. Obviously that means you love yourself

and you want to love him more and more. Well do no judge yourself or adapt victim mentality, because it will just hold you back. Sometimes people love us we just don't see it. I used to hate my parents until i realised how wrong i was. I don't know about your therapists... I learned recently that the more time you spent thinking about the past and how your ego was hurt the less time will have for yourself to love and improve. Basically putting obstacles."

Sure being real and facing up to some facts can be hard. What makes it easier is loving who you are and that is attractive! I have met people that are  not particuraly attractive physically to me. Still they emmited so many good vibes which made me attracted to them at glance. Now if you asked if that person is attractive i would say yes they are it is just not what i want.
