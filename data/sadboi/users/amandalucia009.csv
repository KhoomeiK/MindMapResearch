Many of us have anger toward certain members of our family. Some of us have much anger and rage - anger that seems to go on year after year.

For many of us, anger was the only way to break an unhealthy bondage or connection between a family member and ourselves. It was the force that kept us from being held captive - mentally, emotionally, and sometimes spiritually - by certain family members.

It is important to allow ourselves to feel - to accept - our anger toward family members without casting guilt or shame on ourselves. It is also important to examine our guilty feelings concerning family members as anger and guilt are often intertwined.

We can accept, even thank, our anger for protecting us. But we can also set another goal: taking our freedom.

Once we do, we will not need our anger. Once we do, we can achieve forgiveness.

Think loving thoughts; think healing thoughts toward family members. But let ourselves be as angry as we need to be.

At some point, strive to be done with the anger. But we need to be gentle with ourselves if the feelings surface from time to time.

Thank God for the feelings. Feel them. Release them. Ask God to bless and care for our families. Ask God to help us take freedom and take care of ourselves.

Let the golden light of healing shine upon all we love and upon all with whom we feel anger. Let the golden light of healing shine on us.

Trust that a healing is taking place, now.

Help me accept the potent emotions I may feel toward family members. Help me be grateful for the lesson they are teaching me. I accept the golden light of healing that is now shining on my family and me. I thank God that healing does not always come in a neat, tidy package."

it is also interesting how when we detach & stop going along with the norms of the dysfunction how the dysfunctional people can feel like there is something wrong. i’ve also had this experience & gotten to a place where it is more important to me to be true to myself than to make others feel good about their dysfunction

NarcoticsAnonymous,fmqto9g,t3_fwvi2o,1586306823.0,"well. some might say that you could only admit to abstaining from your DOC for six months ( not clean for six months). practicing the spiritual principles has obviously improved your life, therefore no need to abandon them whether clean or sober

the way i’ve viewed the extreme aversion to any sort of drug or alcohol use in the 12 step programs & the inflexible adherence to abstinence is, that it is sort of a way to keep us from heading down that slippery slope. to use your example: if i determine that sodas are bad for me, i have to put it in my mind that they’re bad & develop a strong aversion to them to keep me from wanting them all the time. it doesn’t help me mentally to romanticize & daydream about how good a soda would be when i’m trying my damnedest to keep from drinking them

does that make sense?

it’s your program & your life. as such, do you ever wonder how closely you are adhering to the principles if you’re secretly smoking joints & can’t tell your sponsor about it?  are you being completely honest with yourself & others? is that not the basis of spiritual progress?"

it’s like if someone is obviously an alcoholic: a lot of people would show concern for that person by asking if it’s healthy for them to drink so much or so often or so early. whether they are right or wrong in asking those questions, it’s mostly done out of concern

AlAnon,fkhp6yl,t3_fijd3k,1584203373.0,"there is nothing wrong with putting a boundary up around alcoholic behavior. your DH has a lifetime of accepting the unacceptable, looking the other way, making excuses. he can’t just stop overnight & maybe he’s in a little bit of denial about how bad her alcoholism really is. 

he can go cook with her if he wants. but you are also allowed to have a boundary & detach 

i’m not telling you what to do, just what you’re allowed to do if you feel it’s right for you. i’m in a similar situation with my in laws where i’ve decided i’m not going to be a target for their negativity or their scapegoat any more. DH had a hard time with it at first but as he’s getting used to it things have improved. plus my feelings aren’t hurt all the time any more from their crappy passive aggressive comments"

AOC,fjlzn9t,t1_fjkv0co,1583458195.0,"ok for one, the ACA was the best thing we had going. the republicans in charge & in State legislatures did a lot to worsen it. prescription drug prices are a separate thing altogether. 
not going to get into all that but i’m a self employed person who benefited directly from it but over time my State’s repub controlled legislature has made it untenable

so the Biden camp is also saying what you’re saying: vote for our guy or lose in november but the bottom line is NOBODY knows what will happen! both of them are polling as beating trump!

and it’s no longer just about the president for me & those of us in the Resistance since 2016 - because we know the president can’t just make medicare for all a thing. there are senate seats & reps & State legislatures which i hope you’re just as passionate about

props for your passion. i really hope you keep fighting for progressive values & candidates"
AOC,fjlgfld,t1_fjkx54c,1583446169.0,"i’m a partisan hack. ok. what have YOU done for the Resistance? besides try to insult strangers who aren’t feeling the Bern as badly as you are?

there’s a reason y’all bernie bros have a bad reputation."
AOC,fjjmquv,t1_fjj2d4j,1583403849.0,"you do realize that he helped get the ACA passed don’t you? that this is the biggest issue that all Dems are running on? even strengthening the ACA would relieve costs. 

but i can see that a lot of folks like you are still in a very emotional backlash about what is happening & maybe you want other people to hurt too by withholding your vote. in that case you’d only be hurting yourself & others like you

also, this idea that we only look out for ourselves, if our sole motivation, makes us no better than the trumpers"
AlAnon,fjiq6gw,t3_fdm7pb,1583373240.0,denial keeps us from seeing what is too painful to face. maybe she’s not ready to fully face her issues. i’m sorry. you can only do your own work
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fjioisl,t1_fjijd1a,1583372185.0,it hurts. it’s not even over yet but i know it sucks. i feel for ya. we do need to stick together i believe. Bernie would tell you to vote for the Dem nominee & get out there & support your local candidate. nobody’s perfect. not even Bernie.
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fjigafc,t1_fjgignb,1583366977.0,"i hear you. all i will say is that she did beat him. he stole the election 🇷🇺

interesting though how the people against Bernie say the same thing : that Bernie isn’t a safe bet against trump...."
AOC,fjh1py8,t1_fjgtjx7,1583339580.0,"right you’re still doing what i said you’re doing

for me. any policy that is not trumps is better policy. you can join us and remain indivisible and vote blue. or you can hand him another victory in november 

i’m totally with you. i wish Sanders was winning this primary. but i want to defeat trump more than torching my vote

there are also State legislatures & Congress to vote on this year..."
AOC,fjgs85i,t3_fdcwld,1583334397.0,"ughhhh it’s sort f silly seeing bernie folks insist biden won’t win against trump while biden folks insist bernie won’t win

our nominee will win if we all show up and vote!

and anyway - we need to elect our people to the senate, the house & our State legislatures! stay in the fight. 

INDIVISIBLE"
