TwoXChromosomes,fohbym1,t3_g7cc6i,1587763413.0,"This. I remember working at a strawberry stand and HATED it because i was on my own in the middle of an empty parking lot on the edge of this rural town and guys would hit on me/make me feel uncomfortable. there was nothing i could do because i was the only employee and stuck there and of course i felt i needed to be polite. 

There was this one guy who was like 20 yrs older than me and would ask to workout against the stand so he could show off. Hed ask me personal questions (my name  where i live etc). Like dude no. 

One time he was there and this woman who stopped to buy strawberries offered to stay with me because the dude was obviously sketchy. Ugh i hated that job so much."

It sucks that happened but shes still a human being, not ""a borderline."""
blogsnark,fod1w30,t1_focxaar,1587678833.0,That sounds like actual hell
BPD,focv1ug,t3_g6utd0,1587676263.0,"Thats def abuse!!! If hes into kinky shit he shouldve
at least discussed it more with u to figure out what u are/arent okay with and figure out safe words etc. And the whole condom thing?? THATS NOT OKAY. Im so so so sorry that happened to you :(


Are you seeing a therapist??? You need a good support system"
TwoXChromosomes,focts3v,t3_g6u414,1587675762.0,There ere literally sooooo many red flags here. So so creepy. I know things are tough but  no job is worth that.
BPD,focsiui,t3_g6u5v5,1587675267.0,"Honestly going through the same thing (and im usually super introverted...so you can def  this whole self isolation thing is getting to me lol). 
Ill message ppl none stop, even people i hardly talk to now.

On the plus side,my desperation to want to talk to ppl has brought me closer to my brother. Weve started talking on the phone about three times a week compared to only talking once a month or so at family gatherings. 
i def think its just a biproduct of the isolation thing. its dtiving us all a little nuts"
BPD,fockjui,t3_g6tedi,1587672417.0,This is one of the reasons i stopped dating. I hated the heartache/who i was when i was seeing someone. I mean im going through therapy to deal with it but sometimes its just better to focus on yourself.
TwoXChromosomes,foc4mik,t3_g6rc2u,1587667047.0,"I tend to go for these super pretensious geeky know it all types. My bf of 7 years drove my family up the wall with his comments and he genuinley believed he was better than me/my family. 

The last guy i talked to had a way of talking down to me like i was a child and made me feel just all around dumb. 

I need to stop confusing being intelligent does not mean pretensious know it all twatishness."

BPD,foc34q8,t3_g6rf7n,1587666567.0,"Story of my life! Its escpecially bad when im visiting my parents (they live in a super isolated area and i find myself more ""bored/empty"" than usual). Its like i feel so numb/empty/bored and i have this impulse to drink or eat junk food or shop online. Anything to kind of make me feel something. 

At least youre aware of the impulse. Is there any thing you can do to distract yourself? 

Latley if i feel like giving into a not so great impulse ill have a bath, make a tea, go for a walk, browse pinterest or call a family member or friend, anything to kind of distract myself from that impulse.  Usually the impulse tends to go away after a bit. Its been harder with  being isolated but if i do give into having a drink, ill force myself to only have a half glass of wine and makd myself slowly sip it to make it last as long as possible."
unpopularopinion,fobsz2f,t3_g6hhjc,1587663334.0,"I find hookups are so accessible it ruins everythig. Ill talk to a guy on tinder or bumble and know hes probably talking to/sleeping with a whole bunch of other girls too. On the first date if i say no i dont want to hookup well then whatever onto the next one. Theres 0 effort put into actually dating. 

I mean girls are just as bad but still."
AskReddit,fobi8kp,t3_g6hgtn,1587660071.0,"My uncle is a karen. Is HORRIBLE to wait staff. Will complain about literally everything in a super loud obnoxious way. Its like hes looking for things to be miserable over. The worst part is, his daughter has definitley started to mimic is rudeness/shitty attitude. Wont say please or thank you and is just turning into this insufferable karen in training."

90DayFiance,foay3uc,t3_g6n8om,1587653958.0,Hes such a weird dude. Like on the show he was wearing suits and walking around with a cane (lol) and looking this wannabe dapper to the manor born colin firth type. And then you see him here with his douchey wannabe GQ sense of style and tattoos and its like well which one is it tom??
thatHappened,foatosp,t3_g69ijy,1587652336.0,"As someone with a history of mental illness and self harm, these posts make me so fucking angry. Like can we just not with glorifying self harm? It doesnt make a person brave or an angel or whatever. Its a fucking mental illness that can ruin lives/relationships. If some kid hugged me like that id look at the 14 yr old and be like why the hell are you feeding some impressionable kid this toxic bullshit? Also if anything itll make some kid who reads this WANT to cut because then theyll want be ""special""/a ""warrior"" too (without considering the risk of infection/accidentlly cutting too deep/being forcefully hospitalised which, trust me, is not fun and did not make me feel like a brave warrior or whatever..the opposite in fact)."
BPD,foaq9ns,t3_g6czkv,1587650808.0,Im really really indecisive...even wording an email im in the constant state of am i doing this right? Should i be doing this? Etc.
BPD,foapv1a,t3_g6b105,1587650619.0,"Yeah. This is why i havent had sex in two years. I was assaulted twice and ive slept with guys who just basically used me (even my own ex) without caring whether or not i was enjoying myself. Ill think i want to have sex and then after i feel so disgusted with myself and being ""used"" like that even though i thought i wanted to at first. Worse, it got the point where i could only have sex drunk which made me feel even more awful.  Its a slippery slope i just try to avoid all together now."
BPD,foamnh5,t3_g6elxt,1587649276.0,"Ive dated a few guys who seem to have this knight in shining armour complex. Its like they pride themselves in doing research and saying things like theyll never leave me (which, i mean, how can anyone make that sort of promise?) or whatever but as soon as i start you know, actually showing i have an actual mental illness that im trying and sometimes fail to control its like ""wHy Do I neEd tO cOnStAnTLy rEaSsUrE YoU?""...like dude, we talked about this and you claimed to do all this research. Or theyll complain because my sex drive is low from my meds and im like i told you this could be an issue from the beginning. 
And then i just end up feeling ashamed."
thatHappened,foalfn3,t3_g6i1bk,1587648640.0,Seripusly fuck right off for using a horrjble tradgedy to gain headpats like that. Absolutley disgusting.
BPD,foakh8d,t3_g6ft9k,1587648169.0,"Yes. Id self injured at work (long story) and was taken to the hospital by the cops (who threatened to put me in handcuffs if i didnt go with them). At the hospital they treated me like a freak/criminal and i felt so so ashamed of my mental illness. They wanted me to change out of my clothes and i said no, im fine, ill see a doctor but im not changing. The doctor came in and kind of had this attitude like oh cutting yourself as a coping mechanism is okay,cutting to commit suicide isnt. It was super fucked up. If anything it made me think well if i ever want to commit suicide i better make sure i do it right so i dont end up back here feeling like a criminal."
