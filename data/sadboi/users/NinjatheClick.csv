He told the guy he can just keep it. LOL.

Its okay to stop looking down at yourself,  wondering how to improve, and look up at the world and share what you have gained so far RIGHT NOW. Its okay to want to be even better,  but learn and know you are good enough."

Checked it out, looked it up, and decided to buy it. Cost me 30 bucks in all. Nespresso Le Cubes went for 200 bucks back then! Use it all the time when I have pods. I have reusables but I only use them when I have amazing fresh coffee I can grind."

I'm watching Community lately and I like it. 

Used to love Archer until I lost cable. I plan on watching it soon. I do a decent Archer impression.  Lol.

I also like edm and anything with heavy bass beats. Who are you into, or listening to lately?"

AskReddit,fpre50i,t3_gf4mah,1588851612.0,"I wore a shirt with a dragon and a mitsutomoe to a church function, as everyone dressed casually. This girl got upset. She pointed at the dragon. The bible says satan will come back as a dragon. You're wearing a satanic symbol. I pointed out it's a mythical creature and that she took that verse a bit too literally. Then she points at the mitsutomoe. Well that's a religious symbol. You're in a church wearing a symbol from another religion. I pointed out that it was a symbol heavily used in martial arts, and was often a warrior's symbol (i was partially correct. A lot of families used it. She was partially correct that it may have a religious root). So then she says well you're still in a church wearing a scary dragon and a war symbol and aren't we supposed to be people if peace? So I got downright cynical. ""Yeah, King David was very peaceful. Ask Goliath. Samson was very diplomatic. Jesus also never threw a bunch of people out of the temple, either, right?"""
