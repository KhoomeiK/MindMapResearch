Instead of viewing it as a reflection on you, you should see it as a reflection of their unnecessary reluctance to accepting new ideas. You should think about the fact that most people don’t view your homosexuality as a bad thing, and ignore the fact that your parents may think otherwise. I know that me saying that doesn’t really help, because I’ve been in similar situations. What helps me is to review each one of my negative thoughts and decide wether each one is rational or just a symptom of my depression. This has helped me because it made me look at depression as an external threat, and being that I view it as external, I refuse to let it effect my actions out of spite. This might not work for you but depression is a war, and to win it you have to implement effective stratagems based on your preferences and personality. One of my new stratagems is helping people on this subreddit as well as In /r/depression . I’m sorry if this text wall is just stupid rambling. I‘ve drowned my sorrows but hopefully they don’t learn to swim soon."
