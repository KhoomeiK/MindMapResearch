DecidingToBeBetter,fpdrd1p,t3_gcv0gr,1588532680.0,":D good question!

basically i go to the toilet first then drink water lol and so my day starts with this routine (copied from my notes app!)

get up at 5:30 or 6am

1. hug yourself, listen to bundle of joy - inside out ost and feel yourself breathe. maybe put your hands above your heart. focus. focus on hugging yourself tightly. watch your surroundings and focus too on the little things - the trees, the birds, the sky...

2. start slowly stretching to inner child - bts. lift arms and stretch side ways. reach for your toes. twist torso. rotate ankles. rotate wrists. pull on fingers. stretch however and stay like that for a while. smile! :) 

3. still inner child: sing we gon' change! we gon' change! with taehyung.

4. who says - selena: i'm no beauty queen, i'm just beautiful me. sing whatever! dance lightly but freely! doesn't have to be pretty. enjoy. think of you as a kid and the you now.

5. motivation - normani. just bop and express urself any way! you're basically done. start the day knowing you are loved and precious and beautiful and worthy and you. :)

fin! hehe then i get breakfast with a loved one. :) whats urs?"

DecidingToBeBetter,foiiy74,t3_g7er6t,1587787794.0,"First of all, I am proud of you because of your persistence. It must not have been easy, but you keep trying. Kudos to you!

Anyway, I don't think there's like a factual step-by-step guide to being better. But based on my own experience, I learned how to focus what I can do to better myself in the present.
 
Simple things! Like starting on something regarding self-care you haven't done before or in a while. Think about what you want to /do/. These things will add up and eventually you will feel and see that you have become better.

That's just my take on it though! Take it easy, pal. I believe in you!"
