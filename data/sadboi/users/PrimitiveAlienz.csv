Like everybody who has read the book knows that he is supposed to be attractive. So OP obviously tried to achieve that but in the eyes of the commenter failed (wich is a valid opinion) but instead of just telling him how and why he failed he writes “he’s supposed to be attractive” as if OP was a dumbass who didn’t knew what he was drawing.

It’s a different and in my opinion better version of socialism built on the failures in the past. 

But to be perfectly honest the definition of those terms got screwed over the last years.

MurderedByWords,foxqjrk,t3_g9z10b,1588152768.0,honestly i find Harry Potter extremely overrated but as a fantasy fan i support  this message wholeheartedly
me_irlgbt,fox96mb,t1_fox7nnf,1588137267.0,"my point was while music and literature can overlap in many points both still have very unique characteristics and different possibilities and potential. There are some things you can do in literature that you can’t do in music and vice versa. 

two things: if you don’t know why somebody is doing something don’t just assume something. Like assuming a dude is just insecure in his masculinity because he changed some pronounce. Especially if at the same time you could think of countless other reasons that are equally as valid and are baseless assumptions too. 

second i hate this idea that in art everything has to have a reason or meaning behind it. Most of the time it doesn’t really and the meaning only comes from the recipient. You don’t have to have a good reason behind changing pronouns in a song. If it feels right that enough in my opinion and getting offended about it like some people seem to do is ridiculous. 

What’s funny is i actually don’t think that highly of the art of covering stuff in the first place. Yes there are some examples where it resulted in greatness but 99% of the time it’s some kid on youtube trying themself out and learning stuff. And that’s fine. Because also 99% of the time art is not about the end result but about the process and the joy of creativity. So if somebody wants to take a song they love and make it their own and enjoy that i think it would be a loss if they stopped doing that. Sure it could also be enjoyable and a learning experience to sing something from another perspective that is more removed from your own but you have to get to that point somehow. So if we shit on people because they changed some pronouns in a song and call them insecure we only achieve one of two things. Either we turn them into a right winger who calls us all triggered libtards and then calls us hypocrites if we defend Hermine being black or we just stop them from doing what they are doing wich would also be a shame. 

(btw for me covering something and playing for example a classical piece are two different things. Maybe technically they aren’t really but you know what i mean)"
me_irlgbt,fox5yif,t1_fox4c71,1588134895.0,"looking at a medium and experiencing it are two completely different things. I agree with every statement you made about art but it completely misses my point that HOW you tell those stories is completely different. It even changes between genres. If you write country metal or hip hop means allot when it comes to how you are aproaching the subjects you wanna talk about. Same goes for music and books as a medium. That’s why adaptations are so hard to do and when it comes to film and books they are way more similar then books and music. Try to tell the story of the lord of the rings in a song and try to put the same amount of depth character growth and emotions into it. In my opinion it’s nearly impossible. Is it possible to achieve the same feelings and depth in general? sure. But your approach has to be completely different otherwise you are writing are 20h long opera not a song. 

To your second paragraph: what i meant was in comparison to the once where the gender of the protagonist matches the gender of the author. Of course there are countless of examples. There a millions of books. But it’s definitely not the majority. 

to your last point: I think there is a huge difference between feeling more comfortable when you make a song your own and change some bits so it matches your experience and identity more and feeling uncomfortable or insecure. That’s why you should judge case by case and not make blanket statements (general you) 

You know the term gender dysphoria? Cis people can feel that to and there is nothing wrong about that. Yes i totally agree that in today’s society way to much men are insecure about their sexuality and gender identity but when ever you talk about those things just try to swap genders or sexuality’s of the person you are talking about and see if it’s still sounds sensible. 

If a gay guy takes a song but changes the pronouns so he can sing about his love for another dude would you say he is afraid people might think he is heterosexual? I hope not. He would just express his sexuality and i know enough people who would go yaas queeen and cheer him on (wich is kinda silly as well) so no i don’t think it’s pointless if it gives the person the opportunity to express themself. 

Just let people express themself the way they want to and don’t judge them based off of one criteria."
me_irlgbt,fox20b8,t1_fox0wch,1588132192.0,"i’m not saying it’s wrong not to change pronouns. If you feel comfortable singing the song as it was written and find yourself in the piece wether you share the gender of the original artist or not good for you. 
But you shouldn’t judge somebody for changing the pronouns either. At least not the way the person from the tweet does. If you criticise a change in lyrics on its own that’s fine by me as well. 

But to just go “how dare you change lyrics your are just insecure in your masculinity” is fucking ridiculous. 

Also to your point about authors: first of all i think there is still a big difference between music and books (depending on the genre) i say that as an amateur musician and i’m kinda sort of writing on a book too. (not trying to sound pretentious it’s just a bunch of loos word documents at the moment ;) ) when i’m writing a character it’s just something completely different then when i’m writing lyrics about MY life and my perspective because music is most of the times not just story telling at least not the way books are

second: to have an author write in first person about a person of the other sex is still a pretty rare acourence and i think there are many reasons for that. That doesn’t mean i can’t applaud an author for doing it it just means i don’t care if they choose to write from the perspective of a man if they’re male for example."
MurderedByWords,fowttuf,t3_ga0xij,1588127010.0,"honestly both sound like dickheads. 

Nothing wrong with sleeping with a lot of people (what ever a lot means) and not all men have a problem with that."
me_irlgbt,fowqowm,t1_fowprw6,1588125126.0,">Idk, to me it just feels like a lyrical ""No homo"" WHENEVER people change lyrics just to swap the gender roles or pronouns

that's a blanket statment and in the context of the tweet we are discussion it implies they shouldn't do it (maybe ""are not alowed"" was a bit to strong) 

Not only are you ignoring the fact that bisexual, gay people and woman are doing this too you are also assuming reasons you simply don't know. 

>I don't think telling people what they can or can't do when it comes to anything creative is good.

good so we are on the same side then

>If I listen to a song cover where someone pulls a no homo I usually just groan and move on.

and you are welcome to do so."
me_irlgbt,fowp629,t1_fowohgz,1588124256.0,"wich just proves my point that a blanket statement not allowing people to do something is stupid. 

As i stated in my in my first comment you just have to write good lyrics if you want to change them. 

Also: just because someone wants to sing a song from their perspective doesn’t mean they are afraid of anything. It just means they want to be themself. 

Heterosexuality is as valid as any other sexuality and cis gender identity is as valid as any other. 
If a trans person can feel gender dysphoria then a cis person can too. Nothing wrong with singing from your own perspective and putting your own identity into your art."

me_irlgbt,fowbuoa,t1_fowbppj,1588116775.0,sorry you have to elaborate i don’t get what you are trying to say.
me_irlgbt,fow4qb1,t1_fow3hn3,1588112978.0,"no it wouldn’t. If it makes you as the artist who covers the song more comfortable or it’s easier for you to express yourself or even if it just allows for a funny or interesting switch and new perspective it’s not pointless. 

there are so many reasons to change lyrics and swap pronouns. Yes of course there are examples where it’s really just a no homo move or handled in a stupid way but a blanket statement like “don’t change pronouns it’s pointless and/or silly” is stupid."
me_irlgbt,fovy4kw,t1_fovxttz,1588109572.0,that’s a really narrow perspective. As i mentioned in another comment i’m bisexual myself. Would you also have a problem with me changing lyrics so instead of talking about a woman i would talk about a man?
