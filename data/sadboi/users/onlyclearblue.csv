At least you write and publish these books. That’s more than most of us can say! I honestly admire you, OP. 

It sounds like his shock had more to do with him not viewing romance novels as real literature. Let’s not even go there. He acts like a man from the 1700s who thinks such works are tawdry and clutches his pearls thinking his romantic partner could write such VILE garbage he’s never even bothered to read?

Yeah, listing all that... Try to be around someone who matches your energy. Stop celebrating him. Go out with someone cool. Sounds like he’s too bored at 11 years to make a real effort."
relationships,fh6vi7w,t3_f1g9y0,1581307156.0,"First of all... that’s expensive to you. The way you’ve phrased this is somewhat insensitive to your friend, who is free to do whatever she wishes with her wedding. It’s more than fine that you can’t attend and she’s even told you she’ll understand. Just because you want to go doesn’t mean you should."
relationships,fgnelrc,t3_ezflsx,1580943216.0,This man has already dumped you and is stringing you along. You don’t need him. Beat this and enjoy your life because you seem like an amazing person. Much love!!!
funny,fgh43hj,t3_eye5sv,1580776222.0,I found it so annoying the first thing I heard in the morning was someone complaining about jlo pole dancing and grabbing her crotch. Told them MJ did it but they insisted it was different because he was a man. No???? It’s not. Anyway I’m here for JLO doing whatever she wants!
actuallesbians,fgh3vty,t3_eyd23f,1580776079.0,If all of her friends only ever agree with her she has a coiterie of assholes not a group of friends
ladyladyboners,fgh3m9l,t1_fg95z98,1580775901.0,Nah she just made a joke about Nora from Nora from Queens being bisexual as f**** in high school calling it bischool
ladyladyboners,fg8a1z9,t3_exf2st,1580613582.0,Same and she’s bi what a woman
TwoXChromosomes,fg5p2yc,t3_ewroxu,1580533882.0,I think about this a lot. I think people have to accept that their excitement over possible babies has to be quelled because of the reasons you’ve stated. I know I’ve said the dumbest thing ever without thinking it just blurred out and was so insensitive towards someone with infertility. Wish I could just not have done that. I’ve found the politest way is to just talk about what you yourself want and allow others to talk about what they want for themselves without adding input.
relationships,fg5ojir,t3_ewwzt1,1580533387.0,"You should leave. You didn’t lie to him. You never gave him a reason to feel insecure, but he always will OP. 26 is not younger than 30 or more experienced. It’s 4 years and barely that! Good lord what a non existent age difference. So accepting that he’s nearly as full grown as you, except for his insecurity that has a lot more to do with who he is as a person, he invaded your privacy for no reason at all and made himself mad about what you did while single. He is insecure about your past and has made a value judgement that’s incorrect and even if it was correct, this will keep being an issue in the future as you now know how he feels about it. He’s not secure enough with himself or mature enough to see that you chose him, whatever you did. I have a lot of experience with this in a previous relationship, where I was treated like a w*ore for my past, despite them having quite a past themself. I just wasn’t allowed to have one. I was dirty, I slept around, while they only slept and got their girlfriends pregnant. They went through my emails and pointed out an angry email I sent an ex to say I wasn’t over them. Yet they weren’t over any of the women they’d been with the past year. Their own insecurity is fueling their jealousy and sudden rage quit. They’ll use any excuse to justify putting you down and controlling you. What is your option? Apologize or force yourself to forget it? Why would you wish to continue the relationship, really? You have to ask yourself that first."
BPDSOFFA,fg5nh0l,t3_ewred0,1580532434.0,"I am so so glad she is this person to you, and while I disagree with subs that have that mentality, I myself find myself wondering if you’ve really accepted the full weight of BPD. You don’t really know your friend. She hasn’t split on you. She’s capable of having a different relationship with you, who seem all good to her, than someone who experiences the splitting and other symptoms. She won’t share with you what the people truly closest to her go through. People in those subs have only gone there in the worst of discardment. There’s a reason they’re there. Just like people in the BPD subs are all there for a similar reason. Maybe your friend has found a way to improve her overall quality of life. It’s just that some of us know for a fact many pwBPD keep everyone else in the complete dark about what they’re really going through."
