DidntKnowIWantedThat,fpjr1vq,t3_gdr268,1588678456.0,"Most of these are quite inconvenient tbh , only useful thing I would want is the pot filler ."
iamverysmart,fowjsm0,t3_g9u93x,1588121162.0,"Tbh I over think , not because I'm smart but because I have anxiety . It is a horrible feeling, like you constantly have questions running around in your head, negative thoughts and it isn't fun . And no you don't finally figure it out , you have to ask the person the questions you have . Once you have all your questions answered then you are satisfied . Else it bugs you every second . It isnt nice to over think, it doesn't make you smart ."
TikTokCringe,fomwvi6,t1_fomwqb6,1587906324.0,"Yes I know dog pants, but you don't take a polar bear to keep it in Texas . Don't be like "" what about zoos"" , zoos are a controversial topic , benefits and negatives to them ."

You know what wrap yourself in a winter coat and wear ski trousers on a summer day .Dogs don't sweat aswell , it is cruel to keep a dog like that inside for half the year and not take it on a proper walk ."

agedlikemilk,folgq7n,t1_folfsl3,1587861865.0,"Tbh I watched the interview and I thought it is probably one of the smartest things he said . He is trying to help think of a solution , he isn't a Dr . He was making a suggestion , don't think he was saying ""inject bleach "" , think he was more on the lines of "" if bleach can kill it, can we make like a safer version of bleach to kill the the virus to inject it "". Perfectly good question, if you don't understand the science . 

Shame he didn't defend himself though and started saying it was sarcasm. Back to his dumb self again .

And no I don't support trump , he says some really dumb fucking shit ."

I hope a situation like covid 19 can bring the world together in the future , we know the countries did not work together and that is why it is so bad. As for do I think we can be allies , no which is a total shame . Why ? Here are have a lot of misinformation about Russia shown on news and our TV. Granted it isn't bad a s the cold war era, but I have russian friends and when I speak to them and tell them what I have heard they always say it isn't the case. I feel as people we could get on , I love my Russian friends they are some of the nicest people I have met. I hope I don't get downvited or harrased for this, but can you honestly tell me Russian media is not lying about the west ? There were scientists going on russian media saying covid was created by the Americans. I feel like we are both to blame . Yeah okay western people may be more suck up , I know this a British Asian I feel judged even though I was born in England . But when I went to eastern Europe , I felt more out at home, British people aren't very accommodating . And a russian girl I know said ""wow you are the first person to carry on talking to me after finding out in russian ."" This blew my mind, I never knew us British people were that bad and I'm really sorry .Also there are too many political differences between the west and east still.

medizzy,f8ok6yt,t1_f8ojpre,1574684420.0,Think she meant as in she had stomach pain and didn't know the cause so went to the GP and the GP wrote it off as menstrual pain and didn't bother to investigate . Therefore took long to find out it was a tapeworm. Even if she did know it was a tapeworm ( somehow ?) idk how you can just book yourself into a GI MD or a parasitologist .

depression,f8a4epj,t3_dzpp98,1574387438.0,"Hey man , I was bullied in highschool and I want to give you the advice I wish I had known . It may not work for you , but I will go for it anyway . 
1) you must try your hardest to not let it bring you down , it is really hard I know . But one thing that helped me is I started focusing on myself, you seem smart and you are young , pick up skills and join clubs outside of school. Don't isolate yourself but keep your kind busy . 
2) schools kids are idiots, they are shouting at you because at that age you don't know when to take responsibility for your own actions .
3) your parents getting mad at you ? You said you don't want to say why , idk your family background but sit back and think . Do you deserve to be shouted at , and are they shouting at you because they love you .
I let the bullies get to me, and now I have my own mental problems that have been going on for 6 years . You have have to keep your head up and stay strong . Realise what they say doesn't define you , it is just a bunch of people who won't care about you in 5 years time . And please if it starts getting to you , seek help. Do tell someone, don't think you can handle it on your own ,once it gets to you , it will pull you down.


Sorry for any typos, I am in a rush but I needed to tell you this"

assholedesign,f7uvgwl,t1_f7uulle,1574018297.0,"Personally not a fan of Samsung's so never experienced their eco system . Google drive does work well ,but that is relying on the fact that they use Google drive on their Apple device over iCloud .  But if they use iCloud it will be more of a pain to switch to a non Apple device ."
assholedesign,f7urssu,t1_f7upi5e,1574017384.0,"I can try, it isn't hard as in the sense it is hard to find alternatives but is more once you have experienced the ease of the apple eco system you find it hard to leave that ease . Apple do link their devices together really well, far better than any other company I know of . Also things such as iCloud , I am not sure how may people will be willing to transfer their icloud data over to other devices . Also the go to tablet is the iPad and if you have an iPad and Mac book, which most students and professionals do have , you realise how well they are interconnected. So why would you leave an eco system you know which works , for an alternative which doesn't really exist .
How does it not stand true? You just said android devices are better designed, that doesn't take away from apple's design . They are sleek and look very professional.  Personally I think apple design their products very well form an aesthetic point and they feel nice in the hand ."
assholedesign,f7ulcbd,t1_f7ukaog,1574015792.0,"Apple eco system is one of the main reasons , once you are tied into that it is quite hard to leave . Also their products are really well designed from an aesthetic stand point."

medizzy,f7iy394,t1_f7i92ge,1573767436.0,"The hemorrhage most likely killed them , could have been a hemorrhagic stroke , and there is a large vascular supply to the brain . So if one the main blood vessels burst it is easy to lose a lot of blood . On top of that , adding fluid to an enclosed area is just going to increase the pressure in the skull. So there would have been increased intercranial pressure, which would cause the rest of the brain to start getting reduced oxygen as the blood vessels are being clamped shut down . Also blood is highly toxic when not being filtered ,the blood would be acidic and have other nasty things in there which need to be filtered . So this is healthy tissue is then being exposed to this stagnant pool of toxicity . This leads to breakdown of the tissue . 

So basically hemorrhage bad .
