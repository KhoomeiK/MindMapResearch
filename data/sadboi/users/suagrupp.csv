AttachmentParenting,fqtsl45,t3_gkvbvh,1589645288.0,"Cosleeping started getting REAL old by about 2 years. I night weaned over the course of 4 months, it was terrible, negative experience all around. He also was teething at that time. Weaned at 2.5, that went slightly more smoothly. I like that I breastfed as long as I did but I was doooooone being touched all the time. My now 4 year old still crawls into my bed sometimes. 

Next time I will be night weaning sooner. Nobody wants to wake up several times a night to nurse their 2 year old. Night weaning - tried a lot of things that didnt work, the only thing that did work was to make a big show of drinking ""hot tea"" which is only for adults, this is my special drink you cant have any, well actually you can have just a little sip. It was microwaved homo milk with a little honey and salt in it. Then everytime he asked for milk in the dead of night, I would offer him ""hot tea"" instead, it filled him up but it was a bit of a hassle. I have to believe other people have a better way of doing this."

You'll have to make concessions somewhere but you can prioritize your fitness because it's just good for your brain to use your body. There are times where it is just impractical to sleep 8 hours a night every night, or else you never have down time. It's common to make do with 6.5 hours a day to be able to have down time before bed. There are times where you'll go to bed at 9 because you plan on waking up at 7 and you know the baby will wake you up at least 3 times (sickness, molars, whatever). 

When my son was 18 months I decided to hit the gym 6 hours a week, and it was doable, but the dishes didnt always get done. Now my son is 4 and I can hit the gym while he's at kindergarten (not anymore). In any case, it's an extra source of child care and I recommend it."
AskReddit,fq14izg,t3_gg63my,1589041630.0,"Being pregnant. It fucking sucks. It's worth it, but it sucks.

Morning sickness sucks. It's not just in the morning; the only reprieve is sleep. The nausea was worse than the vomiting. At least after vomiting, my nausea would go away for 10-20 mins. A welcome break. One time I puked while driving. I started carrying a plastic bag to puke in in my pocket, just in case. My nausea lasted until 21 weeks. 

Being afraid of losing the baby sucks. I conceived the baby with an IUD in place, so I was concerned that it would be ectopic. 

The pain and exhaustion, the loss of range of motion, the foot swelling, not being able to drink, it all sucked. I had SI joint pain. My pelvis felt like it was going to fall apart, it was so unstable. My hemoglobin dipped to 93, I was so tired, I could barely make it up one flight of stairs. Peeing hourly. HEARTBURN. All that physical stuff sucked. 

Not to mention I dumped my boyfriend the week I found out I was pregnant. I knew our relationship was in the shitter for at least a month before conceiving, I just didn't have the balls to end it. Well truthfully, I tried to end it the week after we conceived, he just talked me back into letting him try and be a good boyfriend again. So I ended it for good after he called me a few choice names which really sealed the deal - he wasn't the man I needed him to be, he was not ready to be a father, I was better off to raise the child alone than to continue to torture myself or move in with him. I hurt him a lot in that decision and I grieved the end of my relationship throughout the pregnancy. I was so angry at him for not being able to be who I wanted him to be. 

That child is four now, and a delight. I finished my degree. I have a job in my field. We went to court a few times, drama drama, he doesn't pay child support and saw him for 3.5 hours last year. I'm tired but well supported."

This may not actually be the case - there is still amniotic sac and placenta fully inside the uterus, so maybe when the baby was born most of the fluid stayed inside.  The baby does look a little stunned, which is expected since they didn't get the big, slow squeeze that usually comes with a vaginal delivery. The baby is still fully hooked up to maternal nutrients and oxygen when the umbilical cord is intact, so monkeying around a bit for the camera probably made no measurable impact on the baby's life."

Feeling used for sex and feeling stagnant, feeling tired of hearing everything he had to say. At his work christmas party I was his DD and he got way too drunk. He said something racist to me, knowing that my best friend is a POC, and he said it over and over to hurt my feelings. I've never wanted to hurt anyone more than I did in that moment. I stayed silent but let go of our relationship that night. Over the next month he was being pathetic and unreliable, his laziness causing me an inconvenience, and I tried to break up with him. He declined and promised he would work on it. He knocked me up on new years eve, and sent me home to spend time with my parents at 10:30 instead of bringing in the new year together. As soon as I found out I was pregnant, I broke up with him immediately, knowing he was too mentally unstable and not capable of being a good partner or father. I'm so glad he called me a slut, whore, and threatened to kill himself so much in those weeks after I left him, it made it so clear that I had made the right decision. Otherwise I could have been tempted to heal our family. 

I carried and birthed his baby alone. I raised his baby alone. He has no say in how we run our lives and I'm so grateful for everything that he has given me. I'm so grateful he has given me my freedom, strength, and power. I hope to one day pay him back."

When my son was 3 (a few months ago), I decided to see how far I could push his endurance. We basically walked as much as possible all summer long. Stopping to pick up pebbles is par for the course, lower your expectations of how quickly you will get there and leave early. Dawdling is normal, and you too may enjoy stopping to smell the roses, teaching your kid about bees and pollination, the rules of the road, the names of trees and flowers, why it rains and where the puddles go when they dry up. Walk to all the parks near you, and remember, every step they take will make them 0.08% more tired and less willing to fight you about bath time or bed time. Be warned, that if you do what I did, your kid will wake up each morning with 5% more energy than the day before. I got my son walking 8-9 km per day, which is a very respectable hike, and maybe if the summer was longer I could push him harder, but now it's getting less and less comfortable to spend extended periods of time outside. With lots of breaks, lots of food, and a list of interesting places to go, you can coach your kid to have loads of walking energy. When he wants to be picked up, I would usually tell him when I'm running out of carrying energy after a few minutes.

I start counting down from five because I like immediate compliance. Then apologize to the kid so my son can see what a real apology looks like - ""I'm so sorry my son hurt you. Are you okay? Do you need a hug?""

When I tell my son to do something, I got tired of him ignoring me. So I will often tell him ""put your jacket on the hook, do I hear a 'yes mum?'"" Which I have found is helping in compliance/immediacy.

Over time, I did further research, posted form checks, and watched videos for cues and specific problems regarding different lifts. If only you could waltz into the gym and do everything perfectly by virtue of having done enough research!

You will find that you can lift more or get more out of each rep when you use certain cues (using leg drive and trying to bend the bar for bench press). If you find that you're experiencing sharp pain, stop immediately, you are doing something wrong and can injure yourself!"
