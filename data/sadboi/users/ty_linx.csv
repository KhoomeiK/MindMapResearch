Be firm and adamant about your sexuality, and give them time to process it. Make sure to remain polite and gentle, but they need to know that this is not a phase or something that can be changed.

Domestic violence isn’t something that only happens to women, despite it being more common, many men have undergone a similar experience to yours. You are not a coward or a wuss, and you don’t deserve to be treated this way.

The police are often difficult about domestic abuse situations, especially when women are at fault, but I would suggest trying to file a restraining order, or even testifying against her if you see fit. A restraining order can’t force her to go away, but she will be threatened with legal repercussions and that should help.

Break up with her over text if you don’t feel comfortable in person, and when it comes to your family and hers, be adamant about your decision. She is the one at fault, not you. I hope that you are able to get out of this situation, and I’m rooting for you."

It isn’t true in all circumstances. 

Resort to this only if there’s nothing else you can do:

Leave. Get out of that house. I know you’ve mentioned that you have nowhere to go, but if your mother is driving you to suicide, I would rather take my risks on the street then stay there and have this get much worse. 

It’s not a good scenario any way you frame it, and whether or not you decide to leave, please call the multiple hotlines people have been leaving in the comments. Someone can help you.

We’re all in your side. <3

Know that when times gets tough, humanity stands united. We stand with you."
