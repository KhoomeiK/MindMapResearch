Thank you again, I appreciate your response:)"

But when I‚Äôm having a full blown panic attack I don‚Äôt know how much it would help. In that case for me I always change where I am (go to another room, leave the house etc..) my therapist told me it sends relief signals to the brain because you trick your brain into thinking you‚Äôre away from ‚Äúdanger‚Äù. That‚Äôs the best I can tell you, it doesn‚Äôt make it go away but it helps."
Anxiety,fd8bjii,t3_ekar03,1578216397.0,I got this last night. Usually it happens when it gets really bad and comes with cold sweats.

I think I‚Äôm going through exactly this for the past few weeks. I have some changes coming up soon (relocating, new job etc..) and I really feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind. I just stay in my room all day in bed from the moment I wake up until I can barely get to sleep again. And I can‚Äôt even get a good night‚Äôs sleep. I wish I had a solution for you and me both.

relationship_advice,f8njrft,t3_e16hb4,1574645708.0,After I read the title of your post I was reading the rest completely terrified of what she was doing to your cat. Holy shit this girl is fucking trash. It‚Äôs also ABSOLUTELY okay to break up with someone who abuses a defenseless animal. How did you leave her alone with him after seeing how she was behaving in front of you?!! I don‚Äôt even want to think about what she might have been doing to the poor baby that she didn‚Äôt display in her Instagram story!! DUMP HER and make it very very clear why!

PCOS,f8ngxtf,t3_e15qwz,1574643750.0,I know what you mean - I came home from the hospital at 2 am that night and the first thing I did was throw away the whole thing. Is there another alternative to metformin or other ways of managing it without medication that you know of?
intermittentfasting,f8n8rnj,t3_e16zt9,1574640497.0,"Thank you so much for your response! My bad that part wasn‚Äôt clear at all - I think I need to word it differently :)) I mean for example should I go for the amount of calories according to my TDEE?

This is my first time trying IF and I guess up to this point I‚Äôve been bombarded with ‚Äúeat constantly, 5 times a day to keep your metabolism working‚Äù etc..

PCOS,f8n1aoo,t3_e15qwz,1574637843.0,I had this as well! Along with dizziness. I was taking it 3 times a day and in the evening after my last dose I couldn‚Äôt even move my head without getting extremely dizzy and nauseous. I stopped completely after I spent almost an hour throwing up and my poor panicked boyfriend had to take me to the hospital. I went to another doctor after that who said for someone who never used Metformin before I was prescribed a very high dosage (500mg 3x a day) and said I should start off with a lower dosage to give my body time to get used to it - but like you said I now feel too anxious. :/

AskReddit,f83p6zv,t3_dyv9e9,1574217321.0,"Worked in a tech company, in sales and knew the product we sold was not worth the ridiculously high price tag so I would intentionally NOT record my sales meetings and told prospects what they needed to say to get the lowest possible price and if I was making the sale I would give them a bunch of extra services for free that needed to be charged and then to my manager I‚Äôd claim it was a very difficult sale ‚Äúso I had to‚Äù. No regrets."
survivinginfidelity,f83ocww,t3_dyulky,1574216711.0,I mean he calls her ‚Äúbruh‚Äù but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd be okay with my boyfriend being in this constant contact with another chick. It seems like texts between close friends BUT I think it‚Äôs a bit too friendly considering he‚Äôs in a relationship and these msgs could come across as flirtation to the other girl. It would bother me too. My advice would be just talk to him and tell him it bothers you without making it into an argument.

AmItheAsshole,f7x13a7,t3_dxrces,1574043449.0,NTA - I‚Äôm also in software sales and sales in general is as stressful as it is fucking great! Not everyone can do it and to be honest there‚Äôs really not a degree that can teach you the natural skill that you need to have for sales (like you seem to have). Just because they‚Äôre in law school doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll be successful lawyers. They sound super condescending and exactly like mean girls. Distance yourself from them - just because they‚Äôre your girlfriend‚Äôs friends doesn‚Äôt mean you have to hang around them. Good luck with the promotion!
relationship_advice,f7wzeiu,t1_f7wfoj5,1574042164.0,Agreed. He wouldn‚Äôt have been transparent about ASKING to meet up with a girl he‚Äôs been shit talking. This whole situation is suspicious.
