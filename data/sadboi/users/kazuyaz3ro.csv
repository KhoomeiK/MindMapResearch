INJUSTICE,fq3zdly,t3_ggqpyz,1589072010.0,I think it's fire. Want mine to be like that.
school,fa81ry3,t1_fa80oh0,1575840192.0,ðŸ˜…I don't study too hard either to be honest and I think most parents think anything under a B is bad. Just do what you can and don't let anyone stress you out on it. Your more important than your grade.
school,fa7zbnm,t1_fa7xwca,1575839530.0,"It's alright, I appreciate your advice and from my point of view having C's in almost every class is fucking good, don't let anyone tell you otherwise because it could be worse."
depression,f9ci1v3,t3_e4fl9j,1575223941.0,"Probably the nicest thing I've heard in awhile, regarding my depression anyway. Thanks for this."
depression,f7wpmpp,t3_dxm60j,1574036054.0,"Honestly I can only drop a tear at best, other than that I just can't although it's comforting knowing that I'm not the only one."
relationship_advice,f4pcecn,t1_f4pbyy1,1571723775.0,"That's a really good idea. Even though the idea sends my stomach spinning, but if I asked her once I can ask her again right. Thank you for your advice and I hope you and your friend stay on good terms."
relationship_advice,f4pbmyq,t1_f4pbhik,1571722866.0,So I should ask her out again? And what did you say to her when she texted you?
depression,f2bsu2c,t3_dck8hr,1570130599.0,"Honestly, it's like that everytime I get on the school bus and listen to music only to realize I have to actually get off and go to school."
depression,f1pmo38,t3_dacv1r,1569684079.0,"I second that emotion, especially when you in high school trying to grasp at the hope you can still actually follow your dream and be happy."
depression,f1plwbt,t1_f1pdq8r,1569683593.0,I might not be very at this but I'm sure your friends don't mind. My close friend hates it when I keep my issues from her and I feel like she the reason I didn't do anything rash. I believe you just have to have that one person that always makes everything better whenever you two talk.
depression,f1ord2i,t1_f1oqsdt,1569658949.0,"I'll keep trying to make them understand, I'll do my best not to get too emotional if it goes south too. And you're very strong for holding your own for so long, I honestly don't ever want to feel the the way I felt when I called the hotline, so I get how much harder this is for a lot of people. I'm just really grateful there's people willing to help others out with their problems, like yourself for me. I'll do my best to stay positive, and you take care of yourself as well. Your a really great and kind person and I deeply respect and cherish all your advice, take care."
depression,f1oqas9,t1_f1opwr4,1569657266.0,"Don't worry I don't find it disrespectful, but that's just the way they are sadly. Whenever we discuss almost any either important or personal to me it tends to go south in some way, shape, or form. I can't discuss anything with my mother without her try to involve my depression. We've even had a sit down about this, but things just don't change."
depression,f1opjub,t1_f1op4rq,1569656113.0,"I really appreciate your comment, it really made me feel a lot better about myself. It certainly won't be easy but I'll try to get my parents to understand and not to be so self deprecating 
P.S: No one made me feel like I didn't matter, it's just something my mind thinks when I'm not in a good spot. Once again thank you so much for this"
depression,f1omo1f,t1_f1omdmq,1569651967.0,"Thank you so much for relying, it really means a lot to me and thank you for the advice. I really don't want to drive my friends away, they're pretty much all that keep me together. I'll look into CBT and I'll go from there. Once again thanks a bunch for taking time to help me."
BorderlinePDisorder,f1omh0l,t3_da0jrq,1569651704.0,"I honestly can relate. Earlier today at school I was happily hanging out with my friends and after I left and I was walking home that sad feeling that they don't really care or need me anymore just crept in, even though I know they do."
