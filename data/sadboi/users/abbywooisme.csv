teenagers,faibl27,t3_e9ecgx,1576104014.0,"Yeah, it sucks sometimes. I have 10 siblings and am the very center middle child, so no one really cares about me. My dad comes into my room and literally tells me that he keeps forgetting me, so feels nice."

teenagers,fa12yf9,t1_f9zz6vi,1575763808.0,"No it's not, but sometimes you gotta do it. It's not a fun talk but it's better in the long run to stick up for yourself."
teenagers,f9zygbm,t3_e7iiaf,1575746750.0,"I have the exact same problem and is very difficult for me to be around my mom, which I feel bad but then again when my sister was living with her she pushed her out and she ended up living with my dad because of how bad it had gotten. I really lately have been just standing up to her and telling her how unreasonable she is being, obviously that doesn't work and she gets upset which leads to my step mother to be upset. It's also hard for me to be at my dad's because he has children he's screaming at constantly so I've just been in my room depressed, supposed to see a therapist but they have yet to take me. I understand completely how you feel. If you are old enough to take care of yourself, I would say do what is best for you."
depression,f8wpano,t3_e2gnrw,1574896294.0,"I want to sleep a lot, but my depression seeps into my dreams. So every time I sleep, it's a nightmare and I wake up not breathing and scared for my life. I fixed the breathing part which turned out to be sleep apnea, but I still have tons of nightmares. Sleep isn't my escape, watching a ton of tv and laying in bed all day until it hurts my head is. lol. Not healthy but it beats hanging with the real world."
