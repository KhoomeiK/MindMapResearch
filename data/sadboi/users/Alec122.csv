The Tara Reid stuff doesn't have much behind it that seems truthful. She even keeps changing her story and her co-workers from the time said Biden didn't even have sketchy rumors around him of anything personally improper. Obama wasn't even friends with Biden when he picked him. He needed a experienced politician to assure the older part of the base. That was it. If he found any sketchy sexual stuff in the vetting, he wouldn't of picked him. The Ukraine stuff was a dumb move by Biden and his son, but illegal? Not really. It looks bad on paper, but that's about it. When you get into the legality of it, there's nothing illegal there. Plus, the Trump's calling out the Biden's as using the presidential office to further their careers and interests is laughable in so many ways. Really? You guys? Okay. Biden has a good shot of defeating Trump, and he will move his policies to the left. The guy's not stupid. He knows the Clinton era, and even the Obama era of moderate politics are over. He'll do what he needs to do to unite the current Democratic party. So, Trump does what Trump has been doing even before he was president. Move on to someone else to blame. Obama seems like a natural fit. However, it'll end the same way. He can say this stuff, but when evidence actually has to be presented to support ""Obamagate"", there will be nothing there besides little cracks Trump tries to poke in his theories but not anything solid enough to present a real case for action by the Justice Department. Heck, it's the only thing Jeff Sessions ever did that was the right thing to do, and he got fired by Trump for it. Trump wanted Sessions to go over the Clintons, and he said he wouldn't do it because there wasn't any real solid evidence to do so. He refused to use the Justice Department to basically go after someone Trump doesn't like. He was right. He told Trump that wasn't a proper use of the Justice Department. You can't just do that.

If you watch his show as pure entertainment, a time killer but also in your spear time, read books or the newspaper to balance that out, you wouldn't of bought his media persona. So, he basically got elected by drowning out more informed voters by rallying ones who never picked up a newspaper or a book to balance out a TV show or the right wing guy on a syndicated talk radio show. For example, I grew up on Long Island, near New York City. My parents read the New York Times. I grew up with more information, even if I was spending that time watching Nickelodeon, and it wasn't really directly a part of my media diet at that age. However, it was a part of my environment even if not directly. If I was growing up in Kentucky and my parents got their news from Rush Limbaugh on the radio, and that was it, I might look at information and media differently, and thus believe the host of The Appearance was actually that guy instead of knowing that it's probably not what it seems."

Yeah, he's obsessed with Obama. It's amazing, though, he's such a egoist and believes in his media persona so much, that he didn't pick up on the whole no one takes him seriously act, he's just a fun guest on a talk show and host of reality shows. I mean, his money was really inherited, and the rest of his career was being a time killing guest on sitcoms and talk shows. He though really didn't get he was basically a media oddity? The fact he was invited to the White House Correspondences Dinner should of been enough for him. What did he think? They where all going to talk about how great he was? The fact Obama even mentioned him at all, and not even in a mean way, in a light joke about his crazy hair cut, should been kinda cool for him. His hair has been a crazy joke for years, and he can't go with that? If all anyone jokes about is your hair, you pretty much have gotten a pass. Also anyone who's been around major media and politics enough would know that being kinda jokey about the whole thing is a part of the show. If you want to be in this business, letting down your guard and poking fun at eachother is a major part of this. It's like, we can all poke fun at eachother, including Obama poking fun at his wife and his VP, but Donald Trump? Oh, we need to take him seriously! No jokes about him!

Trump should of laughed and enjoyed the president telling a joke about his hair, but he actually believes he's a insanely serious figure. He thinks he is a very serious figure, instead of enjoying his kinda cool and small place in pop culture. Really?

Even respected media figures and politicians poke fun at each other in a good natured way. That's the whole point of that event!

Some examples of authors express a center-right point of view in their work include Brad Thor, Nelson DeMille, and even to some extent, James Patterson. However, the most obvious one is Dean Koontz. His Jane Hawk series, which has 5 novels, starting with ""The Silent Corner"" expresses a very conservative point of view. Jane Hawk's war veteran husband committed suicide, and instead of accepting the official explanation, it leads her to have her own government turning against her. A former C.I.A. agent, the C.I.A. turns against her, and she finds it's connected to a multi-millionaire who uses his charity as a cover, taking away people's freedom in the name of a utopian vision of how the world should work. Those novels really explain a conservative point of view, equating good doers and people who want a utopian vision of a more even playing field as being really in need of control and a covering up of abuse. Lots of shots at liberal ideals and institutions in the books. Koontz, more than any other author, has a very solid idea of good vs evil, and his point do have a consertative point of view more often than not."
