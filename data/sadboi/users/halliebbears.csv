There's toys and trinkets you can get to occupy them. Or you can kennel train your dog at the very least to prevent destruction. There's lots of options to prevent your dog from even reaching those discomfort levels but owners are lazy. It definitely takes work but I think owners should value their dogs comfort over their own laziness.

insanepeoplefacebook,esf2ab1,t1_esdg9rg,1561915378.0,"Well not only did it suck, Native Americans are still suffering today. For one, the population declined by about 90%. All of those deaths linked back to the white people. On top of the deaths of so many indigenous people, the remaining people were put on reservations. Shitty places to be, the death toll continued to rise due to things like diseases, starvation, and execution. But it's all historically normal, right?

The United States government continued and continues to suppress and eliminate the Native population. Historically we didn't really exist before Columbus found America, we were just lesser humans running around eating grass and animals, tribes were small and lived in mud huts. History books say that the population wasn't big and that we didn't have societies. When colonization started to happen, Natives only wanted to murder out of sheer bloodlust. When you reach the end of the Native's story in the history books, you're left feeling like the genocide was deserved in some way, that the white people were only doing what they had to do, that the Natives didn't know anything about anything and therefore needed the white peoples help. The Native American's history is being changed to fit the government's narrative. You can find other books to depict more accurate versions of that part of history but public school history is a joke.

Socially, we aren't people. We exist but not really, our lives aren't meaningful. We're still savages who wear long black braids and speak with the accents from the movies. We are either one with nature or we are violent criminals. We either live on reservations or ghettos, we can't be urban because it isn't in our nature. You'd be able to recognize a Native American if you saw one, right? 
The way media depicts Native Americans are a fucking joke and a half. 

Have you ever heard of blood quantum? Where the government ""keeps track"" of the amount of Native blood in our people. Guess what? It's a joke. When blood quantum was first taken, a lot of the government workers sent to record it didn't ask the Natives about their family heritage. If you were a light skinned Native? 50%. If you were darker skinned? 100%. If you didn't have stereotypical facial features? 65%. Non of it was accurate. The government still holds all of these blood quantum eyeball estimates as truth. The Natives who were eyeballed to be 50%, if they had a child with a white person, their child was considered white instead of 50% Native. This program is made to systematically wipe out the Native population. You claim you're native? Well your blood quantum says you're not. Blood quantum is still bullshit today. My mother is 100% genetically Native. 100% blood quantum. My father's blood quantum is about 30%. My blood quantum? 40%. 

You've heard of the American Indian Movement, right? The government took just as much effort to shut it down as much as they did the black power movement. Today, Native Americans are still being suppressed, still being wiped out, still having land stolen from them, still having their treaty rights violated (DAPL for example), and are still fighting to be equal citizens today. 

The white colonizers stole and conquered the land. Lots of people died. It happens. But we've never really seen a continued persecution of a people quite like this. The stolen land was just the beginning for the Native Americans. If the land wasn't stolen, things wouldn't have ended up this way. I think that's what people are really mad about.
