conspiracy,f0vug8p,t1_f0vrqiu,1568992070.0,"Hi, the article you linked is about victims of abuse in childhood being more than 50% likely to be victims of abuse as adults. Again, victims. The behaviors learnt in childhood will impact how they feel later in life. This links with my point, which granted I should have stated in the first response. I was a child of abuse and know the reality. Blanket statements aren't helpful to anyone who's been a victim of abuse as a child, adult or other. Do you know what those who've been abused feel when they hear or see people using supposed stats to back up the claim, That they are going to abuse, whether they want to or not. This can lead to further depression, social isolation, confusion and suicide. That's the narrative that keeps getting fed when only a tiny percentage will go on to abuse. That's my point."

I didn't know feminism was means tested! Karen may well be perfectly informed and does all she feels she can for the movement. Yes, from her own experience.

Anxiety,evfe9zz,t3_cjj47b,1564494258.0,"No. I seem to be alone in this reading all the replies. I took all social media off my phone some time ago. I found it is very damaging when I'm feeling low to trawl through social sites because you can't help but get caught up in stories, other peoples lives etc. I now have to go to my mac or laptop to sign in. Did I miss it? Not for a moment. I felt free and back in control of myself. I would recommend you try it, if even just for a week."
gatekeeping,evc8sbl,t1_evbopoy,1564409377.0,Agreed. Lots of people state they love animals. What they really should say is they love their pets. There's a big difference. Those people will get up in arms about certain countries still eating Dog or other 'cute' animals but don't relate that back to their own meat eating.
AmItheAsshole,ev9bm4h,t3_cir8t6,1564315868.0,Did they have money on them?? Everyone is guessing here and believing they refused to hand over money. Very different story if they had none on them. I know I'd have got angry if I had no money and simply made a mistake of not preparing for the heat. My Father collapsed up a hill a few weeks back. We all didn't account for that kind of heat on a Scottish holiday. The man who owned the land we were on kindly came and picked my Father up in his quad. He didn't ask us for petrol money or moan about us being on his land. Humanity. Thanks to Archie. A very good man <3

I had to drag myself out the door. My head was cloudy, unable to focus, negative streaming thought train. No energy, irritability, random emotions and the lack of external focus. Doesn’t anxiety love to keep you trapped in your head? On your inner self? It’s a bastard. A family holiday is approaching, I’m off aspartame for 3 weeks. It just built and I let it get me. 

I cope by taking, literally, one step at a time on those days. Break it down. What really needs done today? That may be a few things or it may be none. I run a business with my partner. If I don’t work, only half the earnings. I’m blessed to have him. Yesterday he just asked, “What can I do for you today?”. Don’t get my wrong, it has been a long road to this point. With communication and understanding, those who surround you can help get you through those days. The work is yours though. And it is hard work. Much love to all who live with anxiety.
