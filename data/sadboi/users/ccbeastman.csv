even [this article](https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/family-finance/articles/where-do-i-fall-in-the-american-economic-class-system) gives numbers that sound more reasonable. and plugged into the [calculator they link](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/06/are-you-in-the-american-middle-class/), lists your folks as upper class.

my only thought is that you don't really seem to understand how difficult all of this is when living on $25k a year, total sum income, compared to what you're folks are making. it's really easy to lose touch of comparative finance, unless you regularly work or spend time with the actual lower class. the needs of folks who are raising a family (like my coworkers who have four children, two special needs, and have lost all income as our industry is completely shut down) are vastly more grave than those of your parents. I'm not at all trying to be crass, and I understand your concern for your folks, but I'm not sure that I agree with your sentiments. as someone else said itt, making pecunious changes to quality of live isn't an option for likely millions of folks. they just don't have the wiggleroom for that to be a practical, they barely have luxuries as it is.

at least that's how I think of it, and how I usually do it. one, maybe a second set at a slightly higher weight (but still sub-working weight), before three or four sets at working weight.

sorta irrelevant but I'm a skilled juggler and Ive been in the habit lately of just running easy patterns to keep myself warm and blood flowing. I've heard of some guys doing jump rope or 5:00 on a fanbike in between sets or circuits for the same purpose. with actual cardio like that, it can make fitting your conditioning into your workout a bit easier. might not be as effective as a straight 20-minute ride but might be more manageable for some folks.

it's easy to wag your finger and say 'nananana takes one to know one' (another ad hominem lol, attack arguments, not people). it's a lot harder to reflect on yourself and to be comfortable with who you are, and use that as the basis on which to work towards your growth.

so he may have had a shitty intent but actually ended up making the case against the father and son. but intent is not enough to indict, not without a crime actually being committed by that individual, right?

edit: found some more information, though not personally verified. found itt, does make it sound like there was some cooperation and intimidation. 

>Bryan is mentioned briefly in the Feb. 23 police report: “McMichael stated that [Arbery] turned around and began running back the direction from which he came and ‘Roddy’ attempted to block him which was unsuccessful.” 

>Now, many are arguing that Bryan trapped Arbery, and was, as a result, directly involved with Arbery’s death.

edit:

well I found [this. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/3w9ms0/psychedelic_tolerance_calculator_and_formula/)

I'm not sure that I agree it would be so extremely wasteful as you claim to redose but I also don't really concern myself with the financial value of individual hits of lsd lol. but this does show a time-line of tolerance as based on a graph created from information sourced from bluelight. unfortunately, the graph from the bluelight information has been eaten by the internet."

that's really the only way to interpret this. I'm kinda confused as to what's especially devastating about that statement..."
worldnews,fpu1aw1,t1_fpt7bib,1588902542.0,blows my fucking mind how so many folks can just ignore the psychological war that Russia has been waging online against the rest of the world (but the US especially from what I've seen) for years now. there's so much reputable information and yet so many seem completely ignorant of the issue or even in disbelief of it. you'd think it would be kind of a big deal story but I guess us politics have made for a pretty effective smoke screen on its own...

I was like... '1.5g of wax kinda seems like a lot for one bottle.

oh crap.'

lol glad I caught it before I tried a full dose"
