The RDW sure can revoke your APK approval. It doesn't happen quick, but it sure can.  
""Als de politie of douane bij controle op de weg constateert dat uw voertuig technische gebreken heeft of te veel geluid produceert, dan kan de RDW in het RDW-kentekenregister een verbod voor het rijden over de openbare weg met het betreffende voertuig registreren.

I ran 25 VM's on a single i3-6100 with 32GB of RAM and two SSDs on ESXi 6.5. It was totally doable, however, correct scheduling and priorization was a bitch. Windows VMs tank performance a lot more than Linux machines - at least when using a clean install, it can differ depending on the type of load.

and a lot of other people agreed, so I got upvoted and the rest that didn't agree or questioned didn't.

But OP stated he needed a breadboard, something that doesn't utilize high currents anyways.  
That's why I asked the question lol.   
The wires seem to be suitable for simple things you'd use with a breadboard, like these light bulbs.  
Idk about the connectors. If they make a solid connection, why not 🤷‍♂️

you obviously shouldn't be pushing this set up too hard, that's totally true."

It wasn't to a total stranger, but she just gave away the dog she gave my father to my grandma.  
No one knew what happened, suddenly the dog was gone.  
""It's the best choice for the dog"" or some BS like that was apparently a good enough of a reason to just let the dog dissapear from our lives.    
I still see him occasionally, but he's just a shell of what he once has been."
