EatingDisorders,fo40aa9,t3_g5f57x,1587495988.0,"I have had my fair share of different eating disorders bulimia can turn in anorexia and vise versa. Eating disorders are hard to overcome, and often times it is an ongoing battle. Even if it’s not active, food will always be some sort of demon, and body image will always be hard. However, learning how to avoid purging and binging. I think being there for her is really important. At the same time eating clinics, and AA should be a consideration. Before checking into any type of clinics you should talk to her, and do not do it by force. Doing it by force can cause resentment, and relapse. Anytime any sort of addiction the person in it will have to be willing to take action, and to be willing. First step is to admit having a problem! Always pick a good time to talk to them, explain why you’re concerned, be ready for denial and resistance, ask if she has reasons for wanting to change, and be supportive! DO NOT give an ultimatum, commenting on weight or appearance, shaming and blaming, and giving “simple” solutions (ie, just get over it, just eat, just stop). It’ll be a long drawn out battle, but I’m sure with the right support and help it can be overcome! Therapy and eating clinics are important, because as a mother it will be very hard for you to stay neutral with a therapist it’ll be easier on you and on her! Even though she is an adult, she is still your baby, your child! Do not give up!!!! I believe in both you and her! Sending lots of love to you guys! Relapse happens a lot, and yeah just keep going back! Its always a new start!"
EatingDisorders,fo37zvb,t3_g59ymb,1587482249.0,"I did that too, and spent a long time thinking that my ed’s fake. But i think the fact that you’re questioning it, and yet still can’t get out of it makes a very much real. ED’s fucks with your head and your body. Feeling that it’s not real is very much a part of it. It’s really hard, and it may be hard to believe. But coming from someone who thought the same things... it does get better. And props to you for trying :)"
