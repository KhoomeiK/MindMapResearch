Nobody is comparing themselves to veterans by calling themselves a survivor. And your examples are ones I've never actually seen in any support group. It sounds like you're just talking about an internet caricature and have no real experience with any of this. Its just outrage because you heard about it from somewhere, right? 

The world isn't reddit or tumblr. This is a made up problem. This doesn't happen, at least, not enough to warrant such discourse. Whats more likely is youre either misinformed or downplaying ""groping"". ""Groping"" is so broad but I'm going assume you're talking about the least harmful way you could define it. Like a guy lightly touching a butt in a nightclub, not a family member sticking their hands down your shirt. Both of those are ""just groping"". 

The first example happens so frequently pretty much any socially active woman would be calling themselves a 'survivor ' in this world I'm being painted. The survivors I know have been raped, abused, and molested. And probably groped too. I've never seen this large, ""getting out of hand"" issue. Kinda weird because I'm actually involved in this discourse. 

In the PTSD support groups I've joined, online and irl, its actually people who put veterans on a pedestal and think they own PTSD and their experience is the pinnacle of pain that piss me off. Thats whats ""getting out of hand"". People who tell me even though i've wittnessd and lived through horrible things, anything I ever feel will pale in comparison to them. Fuck those people."

There is plenty of evidence that showing overt suicide and its method can lead to impulsive imitations. You can argue about particular statistics with this show but mental health professionals and advocates hate it for a reason.

But to argue your point, the consenus is that media causes imitation suicide spikes. As in, more suicides using the same method as the character. The scene was gross, unrealistic and romanticized. I watched the first season, as a mentally ill teenager at the time. I didn't like it but watched it because I wanted to understand teh controversy. I vomited at the suicide scene. It affected me for a few days and I really regretted it.

You can like the show, but just say its a shitty teen drama. Don't tell me its for ""starting a conversation"".

Its been four years and in that time we have been through a lot (no details but includes homelessness and family issues). Both of us had similar bad childhoods and met in an 'alternative' style school. We have the same sense of humor and a lot in common, but some differences that compliment each other (i'm great at writing but really bad at math, he is vice versa. He is really talented at practical stuff and enjoys planning out things, i'm more creative and aloof etc).

We've both had to mature and grow in a short span of time and there were bad times but in all of it, we never hurt each other and never considered breaking up. Its been a very different expercience than the relationships I witnessed growing up. And I don't believe in love at first sight or whatever, but I had a hunch when we met. There was something. I just had feeling we would get on really well and I was right.

My asshole older brother really didn't like it but that was expected because he is a shitty person. He just kept getting mad and telling me love wasn't real and I'll get my heartbroken. Sorry bitch, we are still inlove and going strong. We moved in together a year ago. Lockdown is easy cause we're best friends. 

I was upset by my brothers words for awhile because if I based my beliefs of love on what I had wittnessed in my family it would be bleak. I thought I was naive because I had personal issues that kept me from trusting, but It was weirdly easy to trust him, and I guess that felt strange at first. I'm glad I went with my feelings and ignored him, and some other family members. It wasn't easy for me but it turned out better than I imagined."

No, not as good as other people my age but most 20 year olds weren't homeless at 17 and had to go through so many avenues just to rent, most people aren't disabled, most people don't have my trauma. Comparing myself to others is a pointless exercise. 

So I like to compare myself with myself. How am I now comapred to myself 2 years ago? I'm living the dream. And in 2 more years it will probably be even better because I continue to improve myself. 2 years ago I was suicidal, I was couchsurfing, I had $200 a fortnight to live on. Now I have a pretty small unit, I've been diagnosed and seeing a psych, I'm living with my long term boyfriend and our dog, I have $500 to spare a fortnight.

 Its nothing special in the grand scheme of everything. I'm sure some woman my age is getting hundreds of thousands a year, travelling the world and having an amazing time. But she's nothing like me. Besides age, gender, species i'm sure we have almost nothing in common. Why go through the exercise just to upset myself? If I did, I'd never be happy. I don't deserve that shit. I'm proud of me."

But my reservation was more social anxiety that caused me to vomit and panic at any romantic mention - I vomited on our first and second date and after our first kiss. I got queasy all the time. I would shake. It was humiliating.
Getting out of it was a mix of finding someone who could understand my problem and still wanted to work and take it slow with me, and myself pushing through it even though it was so scary and difficult. I wish there was an instruction manual.

Different to reservation I know. I'm still reserved and introverted in the normal sense. But for a lot of people anxiety is apart of reservation, or even conflated with the two. This was also at a good point for me, I was already in therapy and getting better at making myself doing things I absolutely thought I could never do and building my strengths. Really it was a mix of improving myself and meeting the right person.

Mummy and daddy I don't say, just cause those seem more weird. I get it, it is sorta strange. But I find more socially acceptable things stranger"

science,fanaruh,t1_fan7ns4,1576232167.0,It's called anti social personality disorder. Psychopath is not a medical term
science,famnxqp,t1_famlvir,1576208411.0,No one can diagnose anyone as a sociopath or a psychopath because they are not medical terms.

unpopularopinion,fagclyl,t1_fagc2ez,1576048328.0,"The ""quack"" part of it is the ""it can physically change you"" shit the movie Split had, and a lot of bullshit some people believe in. As itself, it can exist, but it isn't what most people think it is. It isn't actually multiple personalities. Its a fragmentation and a coping mechanism caused by extreme trauma during early development. 

I know a lot of people don't believe it's real altogether, but I don't really know what you'd call these people then? At the very least, it's a way to characterise symptoms that people exhibit. People try and say it's something like schizophrenia or bi-polar but they are very, very different and distinct. 

I'm not an expert tho but I don't feel comfortable saying it's just fake."

ptsd,fa9mpto,t3_e7xpcf,1575880646.0,"I made a post recently sorta to do with the topic of the term ""triggered"" and how it's misused. If you don't want to be upset, don't look at it. Comments are pretty horrible. I expected it though.


Try not to listen to them. Some people will never understand"
unpopularopinion,fa8ki2z,t3_e7y4dq,1575848348.0,"Never assume people are self diagnosed if you don't know. It can be really hard to tell. Attention seeking behavior itself is usually because of isolation and loneliness, even if it comes across as pathetic. If they are self diagnosed, of course that can be shitty.

Personally I think people being mentally ill is far more likely than people making it up. I think that's just a minority. I think some people don't want to believe it or deal with it. Which is fine, but I've met way more legit people than fake people in the circles I'm in."

I just don't like the jokes. That s what my post is about. My issues are mine. As I said. Make jokes I don't like, I'll just not like you. Same for anything that triggers me. I don't blame any person that unintentionally upsets me. I'll still be upset and I'll still hate myself.

I'm sorry you're very angry"
unpopularopinion,fa5onio,t1_fa5nnyl,1575817038.0,"Smell actually has a huge part to do with memory. Anything that reminds you of an event can be a trigger. I relive some memories because of smell, because they were very present. I'm not upset at the smoke. I'm upset because I'm reliving the abuse I suffered as a child. This is especially common in CPTSD, which is what I have. I actually studied Mental Health so please don't try to correct me.

You're absolutely correct about the trigger warnings though."
unpopularopinion,fa5nhuy,t1_fa5lpuo,1575816679.0,"Most of the time I don't freak out, it's all internal. I don't screech like a harpy and flail about. When I do freak out, it's usually because of a number of things going on at once and my brain can't really handle that. See sensory overload disorder, something that autistic people can suffer from too. Most ""triggers"" are daily and minor, but upsetting still.

I'm not asking people to be my friend or like me. I'm sharing an unpopular opinion, in a place where you share them.  You do you my guy."
