I just don’t see how my body can change, what I’ll care about, or who will listen to me in my 40s. It’s literally just blank nothingness. I just turned 27 last month and it’s still surreal as I literally have no idea what I like without someone pointing me in a direction they think is best for me. I don’t know when I’ll figure it out, but with my ex fiancé deceased I really just want to be happy again and I don’t care if that’s just being a 30 year old with a shitty job and coming home to love if that’s what it takes. It gets even weirder when you add in the fact that you thought someone was going to be in your future until your fuzzy blank end. Sorry for the rant but yes you aren’t alone!"

I always thought it was my strong desire for validation and therefore I act as how I predict will give me the best chance for them to validate me - but it didn’t occur to me until your post that it’s all stemming from me bending a personality around who they are.

“Cracked the code” is perfect. I’m obsessed with puzzles of any form so finding out how to be the best worker in the office is my go to, then once that is achieved I just don’t care anymore and I can’t control myself so it physically shows I don’t care. Then I leave before it gets too bad. I just left a very high paying job due to this/a breakdown and it’s the first time I left without something else in my horizon but I’m definitely trying to break the cycle and do something more stable this time around even if it means not necessarily cracking a code or puzzle and just simply routinely working."

What may be helpful: What I’ve gravitated more to now is running my hands through my hair or momentarily putting my face in my hands. It usually lasts a quick moment and most people either think I’m tired or something innocuous. Hands in face looks more like it’s socially accepted as a “stressful” quick moment so no one usually calls me out on it even though they don’t know it’s me really pleading “ENOUGH” with myself than just a stress spur"

poppunkers,esu41jr,t1_esrgz9k,1562277584.0,"Most epic driving song. The first 3 minutes, where you scream and drum on the steering wheel .. vs.. The last 4 minutes, where you appreciate nature and everything around you."
dankmemes,erpv2t3,t1_erpuboy,1561128704.0,Yes! A top 5 scariest episode! Definitely worth a rewatch
dankmemes,erpuzev,t1_erpu3r7,1561128639.0,Easily the scariest episode in my book. 2D met 3D and I wasn’t ready for that.
