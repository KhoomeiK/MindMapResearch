HealthAnxiety,fqp6yhu,t3_gjx8li,1589537232.0,"Literally me yesterday. I had a follow appointment to get my blood test results today and I somehow stumbled upon my blood test results from 4 months ago yesterday and saw that my total protein was slightly elevated on my liver panel (the ER doctor said it wasnt anything to be worried about) and i literally started googling the causes of high protein levels and it showed lupus, RA and multiple myeloma. I literally cried and convinced myself i had one of those conditions. I only slept for 3 hours last night because i was so anxious and worried that my results were gonna be abnormal. Went in today and the doctor said my blood test results were all normal and i specifically asked about the liver panel and he showed me and said it was completely normal. Its crazy what anxiety can do."
medical_advice,fq5838s,t3_gg03q4,1589095662.0,"I got a call from the hospital yesterday saying i had to go to the ER immediately because my wbc count was high, it was 13000. 2 months ago it was normal (8000). Went to the hospital and the doctor repeated the blood test and my wbc count dropped to 12000 so she said it is likely due to stress/dehydration. Also, your wbc count isnt that high so its likely due to an infection somewhere in your body. Doctors would be worried if your wbc count was more than 15. So dont worry, its likely due to an infection or just stress."

HealthAnxiety,fp1em8n,t3_gan312,1588232944.0,"Ever since my anxiety manifested itself physically (shortness of breath etc), ive been extremely aware of my body. I check my pulse and blood pressure at least 10 times a day and Im scared to workout because I think it will make my shortness of breath even worse. Everyone has been talking about breathing exercises, however they havent been of much help for me at least"
AskDocs,fo2mihh,t3_fhqsu5,1587467878.0,"21F. Ive been feeling the same way for the past 2 and a half months. It started with a mild cough and sore throat and the next day i suddenly developed air hunger. I went to the ER and got a chest xray done and was told i had a mild viral infection. The cough and sore throat went away after a day or two but the air hunger didnt so i went to the ER 4 more times, i had 2 chest xrays, 2 blood tests and 2 ecgs done only to be told my tests are absolutely normal and i probably have anxiety. Its been 3 months and i still feel like i cant breathe properly. I dont think its anxiety so i really wanna know why ive been feeling this way"
sex,fnom69a,t3_fh7jnf,1587128773.0,"I swear some people are just super fucked up in the head. I lost my virginity at 20 to this guy i had just started dating. It was great at first, he was really sweet and caring. I remember when i first went over to his place, he kept kissing my hand every 2 mins to the point where it was getting annoying. I remember we were watching a movie when he suddenly started kissing me, i kissed him back and we were making out for a good 2 mins when suddenly he took his dick out and started rubbing it on my lips, expecting me to give him a blowjob. I wasnt ready to lose my virginity just yet so i told him to stop what he was doing before it led to sex. The next time i went over to his, the same thing happened. He start kissing me and took his dick out and tried putting it in. I told him i didnt want to and he kept saying ‚Äúdw its gonna be fine i promise‚Äù. I kept saying no but he was so adamant that i finally gave in. He was really big so it hurt me a lot when he was putting it in, i told him to stop and he was like ‚Äúit hurts the first time and then it‚Äôll be fine‚Äù and he forcefully shoved his dick in. Obviously i wasnt aroused at all since i was in so much pain so saying sex was painful would be an understatement. He still kept going and i was bleeding so much. Fast forward to 3 weeks, we had sex like 6 times already but only with protection because i wasnt comfortable with having sex without a condom. He fingered me for about 5 mins when he suddenly replaced his fingers with his dick. I realised that a min or two later and asked him why he wasnt wearing a condom and he was like ‚Äúim sorry i forgot‚Äù and kept going. I was really pissed and that point so i told him to stop and said i was going home. he apologized a lot of times but i was literally fuming and blocked him from everywhere. Some guys are just hella weird. I thought my first time would literally be magical cause I really liked him a lot but that ended up not happening thanks to him. It‚Äôll be a long time before I can trust guys again"
Asthma,fnojk1b,t3_fjm0to,1587126859.0,"I was diagnosed with asthma when i was 2 and used to have really bad flare ups. I was told to use my rescue inhaler only when i needed it but was reminded to use my brown inhaler everyday. After 6-7 years, my doctor told me to stop taking the brown one. I also read that not everyone with asthma is prescribed a brown inhaler. Its only for those who experience asthma symptoms at least 3 times a week (which was what i experienced when i was little). Im 21 now and I last had an asthma flare up when i was 11 or 12 so brown inhalers SHOULD be taken daily if your doctor has prescribed them to you. 2 months ago, I was sitting on my bed when i suddenly experienced shortness of breath. I panicked and rushed to the ER only to be told its anxiety and not an asthma flare up (i had 2 ekgs, 2 chest xrays and 2 blood tests done). I also experienced chest tightness which is one of the many symptoms of anxiety so its quite possible that what you‚Äôre experiencing is anxiety too. However, if things get worse, go to the hospital immediately instead of just waiting for the symptoms to pass. Hope that helps!"

ClotSurvivors,fms3teo,t3_fdj16j,1586345670.0,"You might need to get your d-dimer checked to rule pulmonary embolism or DVT. You can let your doctor know that you suspect that there might be a clot somewhere so you‚Äôd like to get some blood work done. Only a d-dimer test can tell you if there are clots anywhere in your body. Good luck! Also, your resting heart beat can definitely be affected by anxiety (speaking from experience) so it makes sense as to why your doctor would say that"

Anxiety,flfzyy2,t3_fkayil,1585124670.0,"Ive been experiencing shortness of breath (feeling like Im not getting enough air) everyday for almost 2 months now. It started the day I read about how serious the virus was in China. I went to the ER 5 times last month and had 2 chest xrays, 2 blood tests and 2 ekgs done and doctors said all my reports are perfectly normal and told me I have stress and anxiety. The SOB is constant and I cant imagine living like this forever. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced constant SOB due to anxiety and what has helped you. Ive been asthmatic since I was 2 however the doctors are saying its not asthma bc theres no cough/wheezing and my puffers arent working so I know for a fact its not asthma."
