She'd work well with an adc whose kit has self-peel, poke, and/or escape. Caitlyn, Sivir, Tristana, and Xayah could all probably work well with her. You could theoretically duo with a Senna, too, but that requires more coordination. Lissandra is also very easy to set up ganks with and roams effectively, so if your lane isn't doing so hot you can just dip at level 6 if need be.

Itemizing I'd probably go for Relic shield just for the extra HP & sustain, personally. Spellthief's gives faster gold if you can proc it, however. Protobelt is probably the best early item for a low-income Lissandra. Gives CDR, AP, HP, and mobility with extremely cheap components. Morellonomicon second. After that, depends on the team comp. For AP support, I generally look at usefulness over raw damage. So Liandry's, Spooky Ghosts, Abyssal, Zhonya's, Banshee's would be good picks depending on their comp. You can also sit on a component (codex, watch, seeker's armguard, catalyst, mr/armor, whatever) and finish a more important item.

random dead seeds happen constantly anyway because of the passive spawn rng so not sure what the argument is here. it makes it harder for her to faceroll adcs early game and she still gets free poke on melee supports either way

>ecause of how many seeds you randomly gain from your passive aswell as additional ones through your W, a low amount of maximum plants would screw yourself up because you could potentially spawn new ones on accident, which kills your older, strategically placed ones

sorry my theorycrafting would force you to put more thought into when and where you spawn plants?

>that means that plants MUST be weak and easy to kill.

yes which is why the compensation nerf that allows one to auto-attack a seed at range is what i'm proposing. as it is, the plants are *too* easy to kill. if an adc wants to walk up to a q-plant late game to destroy it is going to be an unpleasant experience regardless of how plant hp is handled, and they're still easy to deal with earlier in the game & later on by tanks."

A Pentakill skin would rule, her themes would slot in pretty ok imo (maybe we can add like a string bass or cello to the instrumental lineup? or another keyboard). EDIT: keytar

The Riftquest fantasy skin line

Maybe the Dreadnova/Steel Valkyrie line

Super Galaxy

Bloodstone

Heartbreaker

So I'd look at those guidelines and make sure you've ticked off every box on that. At worst you could physically go to your local office, I know mine is still open at reduced hours.

ADHD,fmqqumw,t3_fwmg4j,1586305100.0,"I'm sure this sounds terrible to some ppl but I honestly stopped listening to the internal critic after a script of mine was workshopped in advanced screenwriting class. The prof basically said I buried too much in subtext for fear of being on the nose with the themes, and it made the story boring. Kinda turned on a light bulb for me.

So I look for consistency in others' feedback (when relevant). But that's how I personally deal with it. Sometimes it's really bad when I mood cycle (BP1 also because fuck you, teensith) and I can't shut it out. Mind, I also have had multiple therapists to work on logic-ing out negative self-talk & guilt and expressing emotions and have taken years to reach this point. 

The basic idea, which again worked for me in terms of coping with these feelings, is to sit with it and explore it in a place you feel safe. Ask yourself things like: Am I hearing these words in other people's voices? Am I feeling a cultural or social pressure? Why did this specific thing trigger these emotions? Do the people I care about actually enforce the things that upset me, or am I getting too worked up to notice that they're not doing what I'm afraid of due to previous experience? and so on. Maybe write things out if journaling is something you do or think you can do? I never got into it besides my 1st round of therapy giving me homework related to it. 

I never really questioned the validity of what's going on with my brain, I just wanted to get my diagnoses confirmed so I could get medicated properly and understand what I'm dealing with/research the right things. I was relieved when I finally got the bipolar disorder dx confirmed, took another 2.5yrs for adhd dx. I had a name for the things I was dealing with. (the ADHD was completely obvious from when I was a little kid, but even so I try not to self-diagnose to avoid working off the wrong assumptions when I do get something assessed).

I think a lot of people struggle with internalized stigma because of cultural/social pressure to perform certain ways at certain tasks, or they heard a lot of bad shit about medication (even from other people with mental illness/disorder!!) or think the label marks them as a bad person somehow. It takes a lot of work to unglue it. But it can be done."

summonerschool,fmpse54,t3_fwkik0,1586286471.0,"A good way to ""trick"" someone into doing self-care is to actually ask them leading questions!

As little examples. Could offer to give him a shoulder massage if that's something he goes for, too.

edit: if you also play, you could ask if he wants to do an aram or something with you. i like playing an aram to warm up or cool down. aram is also a good teamfight/mechanics practice tool that also lets you get a taste of champions you may not otherwise play at all"

summonerschool,fmk16xv,t3_fvn797,1586142099.0,"The earlier it is, the easier it is for them to make a comeback by not having to extend to get farm/exp, and the nexus towers will deal with the super wave just fine. Unless you have a dedicated splitpusher top or bot and your team is taking baron/herald/drag off it (or the opposite side towers) there's no point in making a push like that super early. 

It's sort of like getting bot tower 5min in. Most of the time, you basically gave the enemy botlane free farm closer to their base, where it's easier for your botlane's push to be flanked and murdered by their team. More effective to starve with a freeze or just hard shove every time they back/die so they lose waves (exp, gold) before you yourself back (if you have the waveclear)

It only takes one dedicated split pusher to get towers. If they're a strong duelist or hard to kill, their team will have to send more people to deal with that split pusher, which gives your team more opportunities to get vision or other objectives (especially if you can send 2-3 players to the opposite side of the map, 1-4 pushes are really effective if you can get people on board)"
