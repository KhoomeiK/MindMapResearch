Seriously... I cannot possibly say enough good things about this supplement. These little pills *changed my life*. I suffered the same symptoms you describe for years. Fortunately, someone told me about these pills and my life has literally never been the same. It's kind of like a xanax... But it's all naturally occurring stuff. NOT the same as melatonin. I take two about an hour before nightly meds religiously. Seriously cannot recommend these enough. You can buy them on Amazon and they always ship quickly.
