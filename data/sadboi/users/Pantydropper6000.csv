For example: 1,2,3,4,5 are all positive integers increasing in value by 1 as you go up. When you get into the negative however: -1,-2,-3,-4,-5, even though the value of the actual number is increasing, the negative in front makes it so that as the number gets higher, it’s value actually gets lower. So yes, -5 is a lower number in value than -2 even if 5>2."

But understand how when I say “I’m angry that my parents keep accusing me of being manic,” saying “well yeah, you are” isn’t very nice. It’s a paradox: people tell me I’m manic, which makes me angry because I know I’m not. But the minute I get angry, they say “you’re belligerent, you must be manic.”

I’m just so tired of the labels. Not everything I do and say is a manifestation of my illness. I’m allowed to have normal human emotions, such as anger or sadness, just like anybody else."

Drugs,et8xpny,t3_cacrup,1562575611.0,"Honestly man six months is a pretty short length of time when it comes to relationships. I’ve been in a situation similar to yours but with a former friend of mine. We used to be pretty close back in 2016-2017 when we would primarily smoke weed and drink. We ended up meeting in college when I was a senior and he was a freshman, so we were a few years apart, but we stayed in touch after I graduated and lived pretty close to each other so we became good friends. In the beginning he was matching on bowls and joints and shit and I was a daily smoker picking up eighths and quarters, but eventually he stopped picking up and soon I was the only one bringing weed to the smoke sesh. At first I didn’t ask him to throw money cuz he wasn’t working at the time, but this continued over several months and became a nuisance so I eventually asked and he complied, although only a few times. Eventually he got a job and I tried asking for cash again. He didn’t get upset like your girlfriend did, but he kinda blew me off and said “shit, my bad dude, I forgot I actually don’t get paid until next week.” No surprise, next week comes, he still hasn’t gotten paid. “Sorry man, it’s actually next week. I got you. I’ll throw you 10.” Right. Except now it’s 20. Next week comes and still no check. Two more weeks and...yeah, you get it. Now it’s 40. At this point it became clear that this guy was just mooching off me. While we did have some fun smoking together and sharing a few laughs over the years, I quickly cut ties and moved on.

Sounds like a bit of a toxic relationship to me bro. One of my good friends was fucking this girl on and off about a year ago who lived with her parents, but hated being at home so would come to his apartment as a place to get away and sleep over for a few days before going back home. While he did admit that the sex was good, after about 3-6 months he noticed that she was becoming emotionally manipulative and needy. She would constantly text him or call him at all hours of the night crying and begging him to let her stay at his place because she couldn’t stand being around her parents. In addition, when they would go out she would expect him to pay for literally EVERYTHING: drinks, dinner, concert tickets, you name it. He even quoted her as saying “the man should pay for the woman every single time, no matter how broke he is or how much she makes or whether or not she has a job or whatever.” This viewpoint just completely blew my mind. 

So I guess it’s up to you. I’m not saying the physical intimacy isn’t worth it or you don’t love her or anything, but ultimately you need to decide if a six month relationship such as this one is worth maintaining over the issue you’ve discussed.

It’s quarter to 5 in the morning, I need to go to sleep lol. 

Best of luck dude."
