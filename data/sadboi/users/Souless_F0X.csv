Well I would've liked them to just care, to maybe even remember it for more than five minutes, so that next time they hear me they actaully think for once in there life to not just tell me to not be quiet because that's the most useless thing ever and the fact that I've already told them that like 3 or 4 times is just sad.

Well all I know is that my mums reaction won't be a good one, she's going to overreact, she'll make a big deal of it, but not knowing exactly how she'll react makes it a lot worse there's no preparing for it, I don't even see the reason for telling her she's not going to help she won't know how if anything it'll just get worse.

I don't know why I feel that way about people it happens whenever I socialize for a while, I always ghost them, and the only time I usually come back into their life is if I get forced to like in school or at home with family. With me failing year 11 I'll probably never see those friends again. Or any friends in that matter because I've promised myself not to make any new friends, it always ends in heartbreak for me and them, it happens online and in real life, sometimes I break that rule because I feel I need someone but I always regret it."
SuicideWatch,fbexwfo,t1_fbewkni,1576796579.0,"Well I feel comfortable being sad because up until now all I felt was sadness, for me it's a pretty comfortable feeling, kinda like how some people find pleasure in pain. Being happy reminds me that I'm sad all the time and brings up the whole topic of me being depressed and just that I'm a sad human being overall.

They didn't really react they just stood as if I wasn't really there like they were drifting off, but plus a little bit of comforting because they're parents and they need to look like they care. I noticed that I went from the loudest person in school to the quitest when someone told me when I was 9 so I don't know exactly when any of it started because I was completely unaware.

Not knowing how she reacts very much increases how much I don't want to see her react.

As in I get feelings like I want to ghost them as if I hated them, I never really feel that I hate them but I just feels like I really can't talk to them like if they did something so terrible that I couldn't bare to see them kinda thing even though they did nothing wrong."

Other problems such as small symptoms of depression I've told my parents about like how I just all of a sudden went quiet and couldn't talk confidently out of nowhere, and well a few more small things that I can't remember.

If a problem reaches my mum she will make a big deal about it, even just the smallest things, but if it were something like this then I have no clue how she'll react.

Well it's not like I want to feel that way and I'm not sure why but I just can't keep talking to them, I feel like I don't want to, like I hate them even though I don't."

Well I feel the plan for telling dad would backfire, I mean not because of how I did it but because of telling him in the first place, he's either going to listen and just forget it the next day like all my other problems which will just make me feel like shit or he could try to help me in a way that isn't just talking or understanding and I don't want that, I don't want this to be a big thing. I'm not really scared of my mum but she just really doesn't know how to help me, talking to her is a big struggle and she makes big fusses about small things, I just don't really like being around her in general and there's no way I'd be able to tell her.

I'm not sure if I'll be able to talk to those people again, honestly I don't think I want to, not because I don't like them but I don't want to ghost them again, it hurts me and it hurts them. I've promised myself not to make any new friends because it always ends in heartbreak, the longer I spend around them the harder it gets to talk to them until I can't anymore, I hate it and they hate it, it happens everywhere including online, especially online."

And as for my future, I'm very sure that I'll never be able to fix my life, I don't have the motivation to do any of that, I've lost pleasure in everything, anything I used to find fun is dull and any new hobbies last me at most a week, I don't have the motivation to get a job, drivers license, or pass school either since I haven't really attended it the past five or so months.

Not like I'm even able to, I stuggle enough asking a friend what the time is but this would just be impossible. I'm not sure I'm ever going to be able to get help, the only times I get help is when it's forced on me I physically can't ask or accept help otherwise."

SuicideWatch,fb92jr1,t1_fb88gwx,1576627746.0,"Well I'm not sure that I really even want to react to these emotions I'm not really sure if I want to go back to normal anymore. Well I'm starting to get happy at a lot of things like being around my dog hearing jokes or winning a video game, nothing special but I kinda wish there weren't so many things that make me happy because now it just feel like it's not that special and I've only really had it for like a month.

Well I wouldn't be able to just tell them, my plan is that I'm going to randomly send a post simular to this one to my dad one day, I'm not sure how I'm going to tell my mom though I'm kinda scared of her. And when I said perfect kid that just means me being cured and going back to how I was before.

I ghost my friends all the time I couldn't spend half a year without ghosting them a few weeks. But this one has gone on for a very long time, it's been two or three months already and now it's going to reach through the entire six weeks of school holidays, they won't be in my classes because I failed year 11 and some of them won't be at school anymore so I'll never see them again."
