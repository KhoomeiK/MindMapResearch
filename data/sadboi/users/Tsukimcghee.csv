mentalhealth,fo4ws66,t3_g5q6j8,1587512750.0,I’d say she sounds like she’s in some kind of depressive state. These are all signs of someone in a depression. Remember that depression can present in a manner of ways. Her boyfriend might be privy to her feelings and is supportive in how she is. Love conquers all. Maybe look at ways that you can help her with. Being depressed doesn’t always look how it sounds. She may not be depressed either. She may just give no fucks about normal life right now and just riding a fuck it wave. Maybe buy some snacks and try and have a light hearted chat with her. Try and connect on some level and see if you can get some more information from her. If it is depression the last thing you should be doing is making her feel worse for what she is doing. If it has little to zero impact on your own daily life it’s best keeping the commentary about her life and choices to a minimum. Hope she’s ok x

Could you maybe suggest a marriage councillor or even just to talk these feelings through with her. You have that craving for a wife that can be what you need and she is depressed and probably feels like she deserves you to leave her. Try one more time. Pull her tobyou at some point and tell her you love her. She might just react in a way you haven’t known for a long time which might awaken something in you and her. Look at her directly even without touching her and tell her that you want her. You may be both so far apart these days that you just don’t know each other anymore. Ask her if she wants to get to know you again. See if she’d like to go on a date. Hold hands first. Start from the start. I wish you al the luck in the world and I hope you find your happiness man.
