I got CRAZY side effects (headaches, chronic fatigue, stomach pains, severe constipation), but my doctor adjusted the dosage and things have been much better since then. I was in the worst flare I’ve had since diagnosis when I got switched to it. 2 weeks have gone by since the dosage was adjusted and I haven’t had any blood in the bowl or pains - which is amazing honestly. Not sure if that helps, but I would definitely be on the lookout for side effects - a few of my other IBD friends mentioned side effects as well when I talked to them about it before switching."

I’d get really close to the fissure healing and then a bad day of diarrhea + toilet paper would irritate everything so much. So the bidet helps soothe the area (at least for me it did!).

I also did sitz baths nightly for about 1-2 weeks and that helped too. I don’t have an actual bathtub - just a stand alone shower - so I was able to purchase one that goes on the toilet. I hope yours heals soon so you find some relief!

Edit: I also was having major rectal muscle spasms coupled with a fissure, so my doc prescribed me a special suppository that would help the fissure and a cream to relax the muscles and help the spasms. That knocked everything out within 2 weeks and I was never more relieved. If it’s persistent, check with your doc!"

This flex sig was a last minute procedure to gauge how bad my flare was, as everything happened all of a sudden. Since the previous inflammation was found so low, she decided to do a flex sig to spare me the colonoscopy prep (in case there wasn’t much change) and to speed things up.

fearofflying,fcv74jw,t3_ej35ah,1577996024.0,"So sorry you’re an anxious flyer too, but something a flight attendant said to me once has stayed with me for every domestic flight after that. I boarded a flight from Florida to New York and had a meltdown. She was very sweet and said “you’ve got nothing to worry about because we’ve been flying all day! This plane is warmed up and has been performing excellently.”

For some reason, I’d never thought about how domestic flights often come from somewhere before you and leave to another destination after you. That made me feel better about anything structurally going wrong with the plane since it’s been flying already (and it’s not like it’s the plane’s first outing ever - if that makes any sense). That being said, that doesn’t account for turbulence and any outside factors BUT I still found it helpful.

Also, whenever there’s a lot of turbulence,  I usually look right at the flight attendants. If they don’t look worried, I feel WAY less nervous. On the flight I mentioned above, they actually delayed drink service because of turbulence. You could tell because the flight attendants remained seated ... but they were still chatty and smiley which eased my nerves. The captain came on and apologized for it and said the service would begin shortly. 

I’m not sure if this is helpful, but I hope it maybe helped give a few helpful things to think about! You can also tell the flight attendants you’re a nervous flyer and they’re usually really nice about it. Wishing you luck on your flight!! You can DO this!!!"

Anyway, after a night of drinking, I had put my hair in a ponytail and threw an athletic headband in. I looked at my reflection in my phone and blurted out “I look like a cancer patient.” The girl I didn’t know too well just looked at me and plainly said “my mom has cancer.” I didn’t even recognize at the time how much impact my statement had. To this day, I have no idea why I said that or the thought even crossed my brain. Like, what was the point of that statement ... was I trying to say you couldn’t tell I had hair? 

I think about that moment often and hate that I said such a hurtful thing, and I feel like that’s a comment she will always remember.

3 days before mine, I cut back on heavier foods to make the prep more bearable. I ate a lot of easily digestible things like soup, lean meat, sweet potatoes without the skin, mashed potatoes, banana/fruit smoothies etc.

Day before:

I mixed my prep with the Gatorade Frost - it’s like a white/foggy clear color. Your prep may be different, but I was able to mix mine ahead of time and refrigerate it. Made it a little more bearable. 

Invest in some skin-hydrating wipes to avoid agitation from wiping. 

I also found drinking warm chicken broth (clear) helped my body feel like it was consuming something more than just water and fluids. Made it feel like more of a meal. 

Jello was also really good!! Just beware the colors and make sure the dyes won’t interfere with your procedure.
