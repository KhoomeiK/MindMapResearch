iPadPro,f4me2qx,t3_dl04gp,1571677228.0,"Honestly. Keep the 12.9. You’ll get used to it. If you are going to attach an external keyboard case like the Apple Smart Keyboard Folio or the Logitech Slim Folio Pro, you’ll appreciate the extra space for the keyboard. Multitasking is also so much better on the larger screen. Full size iPad apps vs iPhone size apps for the 11 in. I use the 12.9 in with a Logitech Slim Folio Pro as my main computer and I previously had the 2017 10.5 Pro and the larger screen makes a world of difference."

softwaregore,f14eohf,t1_f147ru0,1569173467.0,bruh it literally doesn’t matter. people have different tastes and that’s fine. no need to shit on people who play bedrock just because you think it is better.
ShouldIbuythisgame,f145hbg,t3_d7noyr,1569169779.0,Ghost recon wildlands is very good. It is set in Bolivia in 2019 in the map is huge. Ghost recon breakpoint comes out next month and I would highly recommend you buy it if you like third person shooters
