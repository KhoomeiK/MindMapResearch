AskReddit,fahkxm6,t3_e8xsz0,1576087962.0,"I've got a few

1: I was walking down the road when I heard a women weeping like her family was just murdered I went to investigate and eventually found this skinny pale woman. her hair black and so long it was made a small circle around her. Sitting on the floor. I felt a primal fear run through my body and I turned to leave. Her crying stopped and  I turned backround to see her standing still facing away from me. Voices began screaming in my head and I began to feel horribly suicidal. I walked away staring at her the hole time. (Still hear the crying when I'm walking at night sometimes)

2: I woke up with the feeling of agony in my leg when I jumped up and looked there was a black humanoid thing with spikes for arms grabbing my leg I kicked at it but of course it didn't react instead its head snapped in half then reformed with a terrifying smile. I remember it began to crawl onto my bed the spikes landed next my head then I passed out. 

3: I was walking my dog (storm) when she began to constantly start looking behind us. Eventually I began to hear bushes rustling. Not to long after storm broke free from her collar (she bloody hates it to bits) but instead of bolting like she does normally she stared into the distance letting out small growls. I got her collar back on then continued the walk. Up until I heard metal clanking behind me. At that moment I fucking legged it and storm being a dog was practically pulling me out of trees 

4:walking with a group of friends in a forest I kept seeing some one in the distance. Eventually I made them out to be a tall white humanoid. I told everyone and they passed it off that walk was the most paranoid I've ever felt because I kept seeing them  getting closer but couldn't convince anyone of there presence"
