Because, sure you make a good point - wearing masks and social distancing is the right and responsible thing to do. But people just don't do it. When I go to the gas station and grocery store I STILL see that most people don't do it. I see businesses that We're ordered closed still taking clients. I see people standing in lines for ice cream on hot days at the local shop. I see kids playing basketball on the courts. Your argument just doesn't work dude because people CANNOT BE TRUSTED TO BE RESPONSIBLE. This is why we need rules and taxes and stuff. Because we have too many free riders, and some things are just too important to leave up to people's sense of personal responsibility.

And before you angrily respond just ask yourself how small you really want your government to be. Do you enjoy, for instance government funding of vaccine research? How about government FMLA programs that prevent you from being fired? How about that $1200 check to help support those who currently aren't working?

Anxiety,fpenqdz,t3_gcs8l3,1588551108.0,"There are standard thought exercises to help deal with this belief. Think for a moment - has anything bad ever happened even though you worried about it? You'll notice that plenty of the time the worrying does not stave off negative consequences. What about the opposite? Are there things that you don't worry about, which have never been a problem? Like for instance I've never worried about a gas explosion and one has never happened to me.

Also...does worrying really help you prepare? Keep in mind that I'm talking about the emotional process here, not problem solving which is more rational. Generally people find that their problem solving helps them to anticipate and find potential solutions to forseeable problems. Whereas worrying does nothing but harm us.
