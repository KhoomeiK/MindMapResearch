WritingPrompts,foe9bij,t3_g6jz93,1587698685.0,"“Oh, oh! This is the most comedic part! They call this technology a ‘hyperdrive’ but such a thing is physically impossible!” The man I’ve been calling “Dad” practically giggled in delight. “This is why it is my favorite film.” 

“Yeah, totally hilarious, Dad!” I smiled at his mirth. “You’ll have to teach me about that some time.” 

“Certainly! I will enjoy spending the time with my favorite male offspring.” He patted my head. 

Gone was the time when I used to flinch. My biological father was an abusive man, but the changeover had happened so long ago that my instinctual reaction to him reaching for me had dulled. This man - technically not a man, I guess, but more of a man than my bio father ever was - was more like a child. Everything impressed him - even my meager accomplishments - and he looked upon the world with wonder. 

That’s why I guessed he was probably an alien.

Maybe a body snatcher of some sort. If so, he couldn’t have picked a better body to snatch. I hated my bio father. The day he “disappeared” was the best day of my life. Probably the best day of his, too, since my current dad wouldn’t touch a drop of alcohol and his liver disease had all but resolved. 

“I’m home!” my mother called, shutting the garage door behind her. “What’s the news?”

“We are watching Star Sailors again!” Dad chirruped. “Join us!” 

“Yeah, mom, come watch with us!” Both of us had watched this before, but we considered it action/adventure more than comedy. It really wasn’t funny at all, but I liked seeing my dad laugh.

“Should I make popcorn?” my mother wondered. “Speaking of which, honey, I ran into the Darwins today. They said your nectarine-popcorn casserole was very...interesting.”

“Interesting, yes!” Dad exclaimed. “I am happy they found it so pleasing!”

I tried not to snort. He still had a lot to learn. 

My mom came over and kissed him on the cheek, then kissed me on the head. Dad’s eyes lit up. “Will we be engaging in the physical - “

“Mark!” she interrupted him, throwing a meaningful look in my direction. “Not in front of children!”

“Ew, dad!” I groaned. 

He deflated. “I apologize. I have insulted you.” 

“No, no, it’s just - keep that to yourselves,” I advised him. “It’s not for kids to hear.”

“I see.” He nodded solemnly. “I knew this, however. As I have resided in this cultural sphere for the duration of my life.”

Worst save ever.

See, he didn’t know that we knew. We didn’t really feel like telling him. If it made him feel more like part of the family, then so be it. We wanted him to be as happy as he made us.

My mom sat down next to him and smiled. Her nose was a bit crooked, from the many times it had been broken, but he still greeted her with, “My beautiful life partner! How have you fared today?”

“I had a good day,” she told him, no longer afraid of talking while he was watching TV. “Someone sent me roses...?”

He clapped giddily. “You received the dead plants! I am happy to have decapitated them for you.”

“Psst,” I whispered, nudging him with my elbow. “Not ‘decapitated’. Just ‘cut’.”

The way he looked at me, with his eyes wide and fearful - an inkling that maybe I knew his secret - made me scramble to fix things. 

“You’re always using such big words, Dad! Not all of us have gone to college already.”

Dad relaxed. “Ah, yes! I have a remarkable educational pedigree! Worry not, Damien. You too will one day embark on an academic journey of legendary importance!”

I settled back, smiling. My grades *had* gotten better since this new dad came around. He was so patient and kind and I loved learning from him as much as he loved learning from me. I don’t even care that he’s an alien. For all intents and purposes, he’s the best dad ever."

God forbid she excludes ANYONE, right? That’s ridiculous. Diversity in art as a whole is necessary, not from every single artist. She is ADDING to it. 

And it is needed. Just because you saw black people in paintings growing up doesn’t mean everyone has. I haven’t seen a lot of that. It’s because I DID NOT LIVE THE SAME LIFE AS YOU.

If they were only allowed to publish results of high statistical significance, not only would that skew data monumentally, but it would also encourage fudging the data. 

Also, there are situations (rare diseases, limited resources, etc) where it isn’t possible to increase the power of the study. That doesn’t make it unpublishable. It’s still important for us to know what they found out. The thing that gets missed is, you can’t take any one study without context (eg the Lancet article about vaccines causing autism). You have to take the evidence as a whole to see what ends up being more plausible. I’m sure that study had high statistical significance, because the data was made up.

asexuality,fi8mg7i,t1_fi8dme3,1582243508.0,"It’s so nice to hear from someone who had almost the same experience! I definitely feel like I have an unhealthy relationship with my body because of the way I was brought up, but I’m not sure it matters if I’m never going to be in a relationship. 

I only learned about asexuality about a year ago. I certainly don’t want to have sex now, but I’m not sure if I ever did. 

I ask this as an Indian girl, what do you do when your parents want you to get married? My parents are getting to that point. I just don’t know how to tell them."

pics,fi6tluu,t1_fi6o93l,1582207070.0,"So the teachers there wearing cotton-polyester blends can’t advocate for it either, right? They’re getting fired too, right? Because we can’t just decide homosexuality is a sin and not the rest of the stuff in the Bible, right?

Seriously though, the “law of the Catholic Church” became bullshit the minute they started abusing kids and covering it up (so a long time ago). Religion should be about kindness to others, acceptance, mercy, and forgiveness. Catholics who discriminate against the LGBTQ community are doing none of these things and don’t get to argue that they have religion on their side. If your theology is “I have a problem with those two consenting adults getting married even though my own priests have abused children and my church hid it and I still belong to the church anyway” - you’ve got a problem."
depression,fi5zsxg,t1_fi5l2mv,1582174623.0,"Definitely. We all struggle with this in one way or another, whether it’s depending on SO’s, friends, or family. It’s important to acknowledge that they get exhausted and for their own mental health might need to step away. I wouldn’t want anyone to feel the way I’m feeling so if they straight up tell me they need a break then it’s fine. Better than cracking and screaming at me to get my shit together (which has also happened multiple times). Mentally healthy people don’t have an unlimited source of energy, just more than us."
ABCDesis,fi5mbf2,t3_f6iz8s,1582166126.0,"Are you me?

But in all honesty it makes me so so guilty. Like both my parents work so hard and here I am playing candy crush on my phone for hours. Technically I’m a student, which is what they say when I try to help them with anything (“go study!”) but feeling so useless just makes me depressed."
mildlyinteresting,fi5lv2h,t3_f6ipuy,1582165866.0,George Washington definitely.
depression,fi54r1r,t1_fi50tdw,1582154903.0,"Hey man, I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. Pursuing who is already happy/not looking/doesn’t agree that you’re the right fit for them makes depression worse, and it might ruin the friendship you have with them because they don’t feel that their opinion is heard (unless being friends with them is too painful, then it might be better to back out). I know it’s hard not to perseverate though, I did the same thing."

funeralshaming,fhvyqz9,t1_fhvvisd,1581903407.0,No problem! It really stuck out to me because it happened recently.
funeralshaming,fhvypcn,t1_fhvazk0,1581903383.0,Yeah she has a history of doing stuff like inviting herself over to other people’s houses and stuff like that. This one took the cake though.
weddingshaming,fhu1ac4,t1_fhtkf2z,1581880631.0,"Does any sort of bereavement shaming count? I know a lady who posted in a large group chat that her husband had died. She got a whole ton of condolence messages and hours later was like “he’s still in the hospital, doing better now.” Like wtf? Wait until the death certificate? My guess is that the minute he coded she was on her phone letting everyone know, and then they brought him back."
asexuality,fhcznf8,t1_fhcpqeu,1581474216.0,That really sucks. Both that so many men (at least on Reddit) make sex the center of their life and that ace guys feel like they’re being judged.
asexuality,fhcot99,t3_f2cncx,1581467543.0,"Being on reddit has made me feel like most men only think about sex, which rationally I know is wrong but it’s literally everywhere on this site, on subs that have nothing to do with it. I’m glad you have a marriage that works for you because reddit has made me feel like that’s impossible."

ABCDesis,fha13gl,t3_f1y2mq,1581394416.0,"I don’t know how often this works, but it works with my parents. I repeated what they were saying in my own words, showing them why it hurt. I told them “all I hear is you telling me I’m not good enough.” I told them that in the future if they wanted to be supportive, they could ask if I needed help or if I needed to have some time alone. I walked them through each step because all of this is not something some desi parents have ever been exposed to."

weddingshaming,fgo7yl2,t1_fgnpklq,1580962026.0,"I really do need one, no I don’t have one. For the most part I get by by avoiding situations that make me feel like this - not going to big parties, asking friends to meet one on one, always having some sort of work to do in a group setting so if I’m left out I can pretend it’s fine because I need to work anyway. But no, I don’t really know what I would do if a similar situation happened."
weddingshaming,fgo7qtj,t1_fgnotcb,1580961869.0,"I was reading through some posts on here and i realized that from someone else’s perspective, I looked like a huge jerk and I could imagine the way they would write this story. They didn’t know me or anything about my illness so they probably thought I was causing a scene. I feel like the replies to that post would have been “let her cry on her own and you guys enjoy the day” (which is what I was going for at the time tbh) but the poor bride felt obligated to help out."

weddingshaming,fgnh97s,t1_fgn38w9,1580944842.0,"I’m sorry if I didn’t make it clear - I really did not want to have a breakdown there. I tried to power through it but I couldn’t. And so far the people in my life have been very supportive even without knowing my diagnosis so I am lucky in that regard. But you’re right, to another person in the party it might have looked like I was trying to ruin the event like you said, which is why I posted in this sub. I know it would have been easier if I hadn’t gone, but that would have disappointed her too so I was in a bit of a no-win situation."

weddingshaming,fgngx7g,t1_fgncfda,1580944638.0,I will definitely tell her next time I see her. At the time I tried to sweep it under the rug but that obviously did not fool anyone.
weddingshaming,fgngu4f,t1_fgmzk4p,1580944584.0,"Yeah she’s really fantastic. I’m lucky to have a few people in my life like that actually who are very understanding. Things are slightly better now and I’ve been working on changing my perspective. Every once in a while I still have a bad day though. Today is kind of one of them, which is why I was dwelling on this moment."
