harvestmoon,fp2wcmz,t1_fp2r5qd,1588268983.0,I've never played N64/Ps1 versions before. How are they different?
harvestmoon,fp2w9kc,t1_fp2hj16,1588268942.0,You can also use them for cooking!
harvestmoon,fp21sph,t1_fp218yu,1588253340.0,It's pretty fun. There's so many things you can do and  it's not that expensive! I think it's worth it.
depression,ew3r32v,t1_ew3n5vv,1565091995.0,Thank you so much
AskReddit,eupk60o,t1_eupjn07,1563958438.0,To each his own right? ðŸ˜‚
AskReddit,eupjxbu,t3_ch5j8k,1563958316.0,Oh hell yeah. I know what you're saying. Figures are expensive
AskReddit,eupjicp,t1_eupj9tf,1563958095.0,Really. I used to go with my friend to buy doujinshis before.
AskReddit,eupj8ls,t1_eupj0ec,1563957974.0,Oh yeaaah I'm actually trying to sell those stuff right now. People like them.
AskReddit,eupj3kd,t1_eupiwl4,1563957906.0,U know I can't tell if that is a joke or not. And in Japan no one thinks like that lol. It's normal here.
AskReddit,eupizvj,t1_eupiult,1563957855.0,That makes sense to me. Do you know of people who do that?
AskReddit,eupis7k,t1_eupil06,1563957749.0,Do you buy doujinshis?
AskReddit,eupipwh,t1_eupieha,1563957719.0,I seeee makes sense.
AskReddit,eupibso,t1_eupi60p,1563957538.0,That's a surprise. Since they eat rice as much as Japanese people do I'd suspect they'd make good rice cookers.
depression,eoi5nfx,t3_brsy1y,1558611127.0,This is why I don't try anymore lol
