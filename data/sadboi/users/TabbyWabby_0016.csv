tifu,fnzpewb,t1_fnzod3w,1587398393.0,"I appreciate that.

I don't disagree with your statement, but saying that implies that someone should forgo getting treatment because the system is taxed. And while it is, sometimes you cannot help that you are hurt/sick and require medical services. Many patients are scared to leave their home and get treatment because of Corona, and then they make themselves worse in lieu of that. I see lots of people who would have benefited from coming to see us well before they waited, and then had to go to the ER because they chose to wait. I realize it's a tough choice to make sometimes, but telemedicine really only goes so far. Especially when someone has pneumonia, and you can't diagnose that very well without listening to their lungs or doing a chest x-ray. :( I really worry about how many people are getting the help they need. It's great for refilling meds, but when people really get sick....I fear they might be losing access to important services. That is the disadvantage this pandemic is causing."

malcolminthemiddle,fnzmdck,t1_fnzl6tv,1587396810.0,"I can feel that. College is more involved that way. Much more hardcore in that you put yourself in debt, go to class, and have profs that will literally flunk you with a smile on their face. Absolutely no craps given if you don't pass. I don't think a lot of people can handle that, which is why they don't make mainstream school that way.

And honestly, having been there, the cancer patient and the chronic pain liar will both appear similar in the beginning when asking for meds. That's what people never tell you. The difference is one can receive a diagnosis. However, it's crucial to give them both equal patience, freedom from bias, and empathy on my end in the meantime. I really am sorry for your experience with the negatives. For I am so thankful for my doctors. They've taught me a lot, and I learn just as much from my patients. I really love what I do.
