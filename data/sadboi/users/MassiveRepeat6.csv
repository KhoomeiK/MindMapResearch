I would say to do some research into nutrition and foods that will fuel you that are reasonally healty.  Right now, sugar is what you should be trying to cut down on.

Some people here can't touch a woman without them being repulsed. Some people here can't even get a woman to talk to them at all. I can't get a woman to even spend an hour with me somewhere on a date.
