I finally had an amazing psych who straight up told me “You’re not making your life easier being on the pill. If your partner loves you and wants what is best for your mental health, they will use a condom or explore other non-hormonal options. Also, remember to think carefully when you’re ready to have a child and have a good emotional support system.”  It was blunt, but it had never crossed my mind that there could be such an impact.  

That was some of the most awesome advice a doc ever gave me...probably because I wasnt living in America at the time!  Also said ditch alcohol, caffeine and some sugar and explained all the neurological effects and how they affect bipolar queens such as myself.  Loved that doc.

Maybe your mom observed a mood which became amplified once you started taking it?   My mom always looks for connections and reasons, anything other than acceptance or genetics. - I think is because parents blame themselves underneath and want to remove any chance that they did something to “screw You up”. I had to really sit mine down and explain it wasn’t their fault, it’s been in my dna long before I popped out!

But, that is a really ignorant thing for her to say...I’m hoping it is for those above ideas and not that she’s trying to invalidate your true self!  Sorry you had to hear that at all....I hope it gets better and more understanding from her comes.

I’m so happy I have a European IUD with zero hormones and no more side effects!"
