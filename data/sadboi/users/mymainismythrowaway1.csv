I buzzed my hair and almost started T during a severe manic episode. Once I was properly treated for the bipolar, all the feelings I thought were gender dysphoria slowly went away over a year or so. I stopped binding and I landed on a kinda ""soft butch"" style. 

I guess my advice is to treat the mood first and give it a year or two of stability before any kind of physical transition. 18 year old me thought wholeheartedly that I was transmasculine and that transition would help me. In retrospect, throwing T into the dumpster fire of emotions that I had at the time would've been terrible. And, long term, I'd prefer the side effects of Lithium or Lamictal to T."

BipolarReddit,fkyykbj,t3_flczgh,1584658884.0,"I don't know if they'll admit you, depending on how severe your self harm history is. Thinking of cutting again might mean time for IOP or Partial, not inpatient. Inpatient is really for people who are at risk of suicide/unable to care for basic needs/not in touch with reality. Thoughts of self harm, unless there's a history of severe self harm needing medical attention, are not usually grounds for inpatient treatment. 

I'd really suggest calling your local PHP or IOP program. No need for an ER visit and you'll have more freedom than inpatient offers. I'm in a PHP right now after a bad mixed episode and some severe self harm and it's been really helpful. Provides structure to my day but I get to go home at night. I see a psychiatrist daily and the therapy is more effective than that in inpatient. Remember that in inpatient the other patients are largely actively psychotic or suicidal and that that can often hamper the effectiveness of group therapy."
BipolarReddit,fhp99dh,t1_fhp7i4m,1581784572.0,"So, mixed episodes are a thing. Sounds like that might be what happened in January. 

Periods of high stress can cause increased reaction to smaller stressors. I myself have a (somewhat) similar thing going on with college - I'm currently on a medical leave from one school and have to decide whether I'm going back there in the fall or going back to the first college I attended or doing something else. This uncertainty is really stressful and I'm not coping with it the best. I'm hoping that my new therapist (intake appointment this Thursday!) can help.

Edit: overreacting occasionally during really stressful situations is also not nesecarily a symptom of any mental illness. I'd still suggest working with a therapist, but crying for half an hour when you're under immense stress is not an abnormal reaction.

BipolarReddit,fhp6j8t,t3_f4b0r5,1581783165.0,"So, the thing with bipolar is it's episodic. Between episodes, I usually have a pretty normal reaction to normal stress - sure, I'll cry sometimes or eat a bunch of chocolate, but it's in the range of normal. If I'm manic or depressed, all my good coping skills seem to go out the window. I will self harm, cry, binge eat, and/or drink to deal with even pretty minor stresses if I'm in an episode. 

The other thing is it's possible to have some symptoms (I for one pretty chronically self harm) without having borderline. I'd discuss this all with a therapist to see what kind of strategies could help. Maybe DBT would help, maybe therapy focusing on what's happened with school would help.

I've never seen advice to not exercise during hypomania, unless the exercising is excessive. Ask your doctor if you're worried or if you're exercising so much that it's causing issues."
BipolarReddit,eq00r03,t3_bws93x,1559676215.0,"I don't really conceptualize my depression, to be honest. I rarely have full insight into my own depression and usually have some other explanation for what's happening, even if I'm hospitalized.

When explaining it to people, I talk about my symptoms from past episodes. I say that I have no motivation, sleep all the time, can't get out of bed all day, talk slower, and often don't eat. My symptoms feel far more physical than mental."
BipolarReddit,epzx2ot,t3_bwowhz,1559674304.0,"I've had some psychosis, mainly delusions. Everything from little stuff (was convinced my parents were buying me a dog for my birthday despite me living in a dorm that didn't allow pets) to big stuff (thought I was the only person who could stop a nuclear apocalypse). I also have had some auditory hallucinations, but I only get them when my eyes are closed. 

These symptoms, as well as the history of more extreme manic psychosis in my family, make me terrified of another full blown manic episode. I take my meds daily, keep a regular sleep schedule, track my moods, and stay in close touch with my psychiatrist. I'm terrified of losing who I am for weeks or months at a time, so I do everything I can to prevent it. It's a bizarre feeling to realize that things that you really deeply believed were true are actually false."
nova,epw921j,t3_bw0q3s,1559569563.0,"If you're working in Chantilly, you might want to live in the Sully Station or Virginia Run neighborhoods. Some of the houses in these neighborhoods run 600-700k and they have good schools and pools. Westfield HS, Chantilly HS, and Centreville HS are all pretty similar academically, but Chantilly has some more STEM and vocational options due to Chantilly academy (although there is bussing for non Chantilly students), and Westfield is known for its theatre program, band, and football. All three schools have more than a full slate of AP courses and a variety of other interesting options - Westfield had philosophy/world religions and a multi year aerospace sequence, as well as Japanese and American Sign Language classes, and I assume the other schools have a few unique options, too. Westfield had a major overcrowding issue in the mid aughts, but redistricting plus an expansion means it's actually hundreds of students under capacity currently.

If your child is interested in doing the IB diploma instead of AP courses, the Fox Mill neighborhood in Herndon/Oak Hill has an easy enough commute to Chantilly and is districted to South Lakes high school, however it is a bit overcrowded.

South Riding is another place to look at and I can't comment too specifically on the schools, but nothing would beat the commute from a Chantilly/Centreville house to a Chantilly office."

I believe that the pages of info on non medication options are why I'm doing so well currently. Using his light/dark therapy advice to establish a consistent sleep schedule made a huge difference in my life. His medication philosophy influenced my own (stick to one mood stabilizer + one antipsychotic if at all possible), and the pages about thyroid helped me understand that a 4.0 TSH was not actually healthy.

Third: get a letter from you therapist, take it to the disability office and the financial aid office and beg.

A lot of other standard meds, from lithium to seroquel, zyprexa, risperdal, and topamax are also either $4 or $9 at Walmart. Abilify and depakote are $20 at my local Safeway with a goodrx coupon.

BipolarReddit,ept0695,t1_epsg8ef,1559476431.0,"I think the other commenters description is only applicable to hypomanic and non-severe depressive episodes. I know that during my manic episode it was like I'd forgotten all of my interests, goals, and values. It was like I was a different person for 9 months. None of my hobbies were the same, my academically minded self didn't attend a single class, I refused to keep in contact with my family who I talk to daily, and I broke a lot of my personal values. I do not think that that person I was for 9 months is me. I remember some, but not all, of what she did and said and none of it is like the me before or after. 

However, the person I was during more mild episodes is me. I've had hypomanias where I'm just me but more so. Depressive episodes where I'm me with lower motivation and poor cognition. The severe episodes - the ones with psychosis - feel like I was replaced by another person."
BipolarReddit,eprj8rz,t3_bvf394,1559425511.0,"I am bipolar, just like someone with diabetes is a diabetic. It's a faster way to say it.

I hated her implication that my phrasing of it in a stressful moment reflects my entire relationship with the disorder. 

I'm glad you found strength in rephrasing and I think changing the way we think about our illness can be very valuable. However, people's choice between I am vs I have does not always reflect their relationship to their illness. For me, saying I'm bipolar feels less clinical than saying that I have bipolar."

Got pretty decent merit aid from both colleges I ended up attending, but the grades were a real problem in admission to schools that matched my extracurricular/test score combo. Colleges are looking for the total package, not just success in one or two catagories. Either way, I ended up at a school I'm very happy with, and the midwestern attitude towards college admissions has been like a balm to my soul. As a kid whose friends started TJ prep classes in 4th grade, the concept that the average student at my college just showed up and took the ACT once or twice is kinda mind blowing. A guy from Columbia MD and I were telling tales of high school and it stunned all the the ""I went to the best school in Minnesota"" kids and neither of us even went to magnet schools."
