4. Percent of cases hospitalized is now down to 15%

5. Now one of the most interesting pieces of news from today, 141 nursing homes tested all of its staff and residents. Of the over 3,600 people tested, only 11% were positive (402 people). Of those 402 people only 57 (14%) of those cases showed any symptoms. 86% of our most vulnerable population was asymptomatic."

Pretty crazy to see how far testing here has come. It’ll be interesting to see what they do with the leftover kits. I’ve heard of some grocery stores trying to get pop up testing centers in their parking lots for employees on a regular basis.

1. New cases have stopped growing, even with testing capacity growing every day. There is even some evidence of a downwards curve beginning in California. Deaths haven’t quite caught up yet, but they also haven’t been rising which indicates spread has slowed. Another thing I’ve noticed regarding deaths in smaller counties like Tulare are reporting deaths in chunks, they have 67 total deaths but reported 25 in the last 2 days. Who knows when those deaths actually occurred. A handful of smaller counties reporting all at once can easily skew California’s numbers. 

2. A lot of business around California outside of la and San Francisco are reopening soon, some even with in-dinning restaurants. I believe newsom said recently that over 70% of businesses have already reopened in some capacity. 

3. Deaths in LA have stabilized. No new peak in deaths for a while and spikes are becoming less frequent. 51% of deaths in LA county are now from nursing homes, and at least 92% had known underlying health conditions. 

4. Deaths in LA are also being revised. Almost 50 deaths in the past few days have been either reassigned to other counties or are being classified as a different cause of death. This just shows more evidence of how liberal they are being with listing any deaths as coronavirus deaths. 

5. Hospitalizations in LA are the lowest they have been since their Twitter has been reporting them, and are down almost 100 just from yesterday. 

6. Percent of people hospitalized has steadily fallen in LA from 21%-20% a month ago, to 19% a few weeks ago to now under 17%. The “1 in 5 people are hospitalized” stat from early in the pandemic is definitely not holding up. 

7. Percent of positive tests in LA is down to 11% and could potentially fall under 10% soon."

Deaths and new cases in LA have had back to back week over week declines as well. Hospitalizations are down quite a bit from a few weeks ago as well. Total ICU admissions in CA could potentially get under a thousand pretty soon. I’m expecting a Mother’s Day spike at some point in LA, but today was pretty modest for a Tuesday as far as I can tell. 

A lot of people here are stressing about the stay at home being extended, but remember this is just to slow down the reopen and keep parts of state from moving directly into phase 4. A lot of counties are gonna be allowed to reopen soon, and even LA has begun opening things up, as well as beaches being reopened tomorrow. 

All the Bay Area people should be extremely happy with their numbers as well. It’s pretty incredible how well they have done, and it makes me quite proud of where I grew up!


Edit: also just a reminder that hospitalizations and icu numbers being down today means at least 2-5 weeks of new cases being down, and hospitalizations have been declining for about 3 weeks in the state. That’s around 2 months past peak infections!"

I know it’s a little bit of a worrisome time for us Los Angeles county people but remember they are testing like mad now, asymptomatic people are being tested, and every day the % of deaths coming from nursing homes in going up so that’s clearly where we messed up the most.

As a I said in another chain, the SIP order was most likely extended to give cities more power in restricting certain things like bars and clubs, and less likely going to restrict everything until the end of May.

They had major recording errors that got fixed last weekish and then they’ve also been dealing with the 50k+ tests that got messed up in reporting a long time ago. 

All in all testing in LA has been a shit show, but the increase in numbers is hopefully just showing that they finally fixed it and are able to report accurately. 

Another thing that’s making LA look way worse is the nursing home and prison outbreaks. 43% of deaths in LA are from nursing homes and health institutions specifically, then you also have a lot of people getting it in prison to the point where LA has been shipping out healthy inmates to other prisons. 

They’ve also said recently that aside from a lot of the deaths being old, over 92% of people also had health complications. 


So yeah it looks bad but it’s hard to know if things are actually worse, or are a culmination of a lot of factors just skewing numbers. I believe LA is also the only county in California that’s allowed to test asymptomatic patients and have the loosest testing guidelines.

I haven’t gotten sick and it’s been much longer than 2 weeks. I was already assuming people in my complex had it so I was already being careful and didn’t really have to take any extra measures. If you live in a complex in a big city, chances are someone there has it or had it."
Anxiety,fm51ywi,t1_fm4ll28,1585764842.0,"A lot of players and teams have also said they are willing to do what it takes. Now that it’s been a while since anyone has seen a court I think opinions will change. Also not everyone gets to do what they wanna do, and millions of dollars can be very convincing."
Anxiety,flr7123,t1_flr6afs,1585414287.0,"Haven’t they only been shut down for 5 days too? If they have already hit a turning point that would be insanely huge. Some people were saying they were still a week or two away from peaking. 

Bodes well for the rest of us who are already shut down as well."
Anxiety,flr4qj7,t1_flr3h5f,1585412942.0,Let’s hope for a lot of good news today
Anxiety,flpojoq,t1_flp4biu,1585364576.0,Well it’s working cause I’m in LA and scared shitless
Anxiety,flpo77r,t1_flp90b0,1585364323.0,"That’s good because NYC is scaring the shit out of me and people are saying where I live (Los Angeles) could be as bad as New York in 6 days. We have basically been shut down for over 2 weeks, and shelter in place for a week I believe, so I’m praying to whatever god/goddess/hypnotoad that may be out there that we shut down in time to prevent that"
Anxiety,flpjgo2,t1_flpigpj,1585360927.0,"Man I just hope I’m right. Where I live (California) has been getting more cases quickly but my city locked down only a few days after Italy did, pretty much all the big cities have been locked down for at least 10-14 days. So there could be potential we start seeing a reduction sometime in the next week, maybe 2 if we stopped it before any type of herd immunity could take place"
Anxiety,flpgkuo,t1_flpb4ho,1585358989.0,"From what I’ve seen, and how it’s spread, it seems to be slightly less contagious than the common flu. A person in a couple can get the flu and not pass it. It’s pretty uncommon but it does happen. The same has happened to other people with corona. Those saying it’s much more contagious than the flu doesn’t realize the seasonal flu runs from China to the USA infecting millions of people in literally 2 months. China let coronavirus run rampant from December until January 23rd, more than enough time to spread to every corner of the world."
Anxiety,flpgbfd,t1_flpe6ne,1585358811.0,"At first I thought the same as you. Then I checked a little closer, and added a little insight myself. 

For one thing, I think death rate right now is indicative of how bad the infection was 2-4 weeks ago. I have also been hearing that there is often a delay in death reporting, and it can take a few days for a death to be counted. Now keep that in mind when realizing most people don’t die right away, it usually takes 5-11 days for symptoms to show up, then another 3-7 days before the person is even admitted to the hospital. Then they could be on ventilation for another week or two pretty easily before actually passing away, then another 2 days for the death to be counted. That’s like at least 2 weeks, most likely more like 3-4 weeks from diagnosis, until death. 

Italy was locked down officially 17 days ago, but it took people a few days to actually stay at home. It’s really not enough time to see the deaths begin to drop. They may have just been able to keep a a lot of people around in comas and now they are being let go. 


What we HAVE seen however is 6 days without a new number of infections peak. There have been a few days close to peak, but it seems to have slowed down. I have also been hearing that each day they set a new record for testing and that the % of people coming up positive has dropped consistently. 


Other people are welcome to check my reasoning in case I’m being overly optimistic, but I hope it holds true, new infections continue dropping, and eventually
the death toll will drop behind it."
Anxiety,flpefnx,t1_flpb88a,1585357564.0,Oh really? That’s brutal but also would make some sense.
Anxiety,flp6hty,t1_flp2wt6,1585352659.0,"That was me in feb too.  I really think this will be the key to cutting down both infections and recovery time. 

Please finish a control study soon!"
Anxiety,flp68bb,t1_floyyi4,1585352508.0,"I hope these models come true. Italys struggle getting in front of this despite social distancing for over two weeks now has low key got me a little worried, and I’ve been pretty confident the last couple of days. This shit is such a roller coaster."
Anxiety,flngwst,t1_fln7pnl,1585318350.0,At a certain point when you have 6 major countries and dozens of doctors saying the same thing is it really anecdotal anymore?
Anxiety,flm41qo,t1_flm3mbp,1585274083.0,I hope so. Not having a subway has helped us for sure.
Anxiety,fllurti,t1_fllt5af,1585268163.0,"I keep telling myself this and yet I still keep getting stressed. I live in LA county and we now have like 1,300 cases. It seems bad until you realize over 10 million people live here, so obviously 1,300 is nowhere near the real number."
Anxiety,flla9gp,t1_flkcusb,1585256499.0,It’s a cool mini community that has popped up in this thread!
Anxiety,flla3xp,t1_flkkijm,1585256418.0,I mean originally they were saying we would have over a million dead in the next year or two so at least they have come a little bit back to reality. Baby steps lol.
Anxiety,fll9iew,t1_fll0imn,1585256101.0,"Ask any viral expert/microbiologist about how quickly the flu spreads from China to the United States every single year.

If coronavirus was as contagious as the common flu the entire world would already have had massive outbreaks by now. China let that shit spread unopposed for months. I don’t even think it’s the most contagious coronavirus. The #1 thing that sets this apart is asymptomatics, which hopefully (fingers crossed) will get under control in the next week or two with social distancing really being under way for an extended time."
UpliftingNews,fljtw4c,t1_fljs4mk,1585226410.0,"That article is from February 14th. We would have most likely seen all sorts of reinfection by now if that was really the case, and there still isn’t a single confirmed reinfection case. Pretty sure these are just from the few relapse cases that people were panicking over a while ago."
Anxiety,flj1syf,t1_flj0yn2,1585196411.0,Yeah man I’ve never been more excited for 112 degree weather before lol
Anxiety,flizihm,t1_fliweii,1585194651.0,"Same but I live in California and am also worried about what’s to come here. Luckily it will finally be in the 80’s where I live this week, and then it’ll only be a matter of time before we are getting days in the 100’s again"
Anxiety,fliw4b5,t1_fliueim,1585192172.0,It was somewhere around 750 I believe. If it shoots much over that at this point I’d be a little worried that efforts haven’t been as effective as we thought tbh. But all signs are pointing to that being unlikely. Deaths per day is also something that could begin to fall very quickly if efforts really are as effective as some are predicting. These next few days could be important moving forward imo.
Anxiety,flite7b,t1_flit8ba,1585190267.0,Hopefully. If the deaths continue going down for the next few days it would seem more likely that their peak has past.
Anxiety,flisubv,t1_flipm5k,1585189888.0,"No they just haven’t hit a new peak in 4 days, which is still good news"
Anxiety,flc6y53,t1_flc1b9y,1585021519.0,Anyone know what day their lockdown started to be followed?
Anxiety,flawnqm,t1_flarwc7,1584992630.0,It would also mean that the rest of the world shouldn’t be far behind since a lot of large cities started shutting down operations 2-7 days after Italy and were in much less worse situations.
