Supplements,fpdr4uk,t1_fpdq9sm,1588532551.0,I already had surgery on one and retore. I know they dont heal but the orthopedic surgeons are giving me a hard time and want 8 weeks of PT prior to any surgery. My insurance has a deductible and im not dropping 600 dollars in a week to make the insurance companies happy with surgery when i already know the exercises.
schizophrenia,fk9t0jw,t1_fk9qlfp,1583982915.0,Yeah thats my only concern both my parents smoke so if something does happen to them im gonna feel like a complete shit stain joking about it.
schizophrenia,fk318ig,t1_fk2c2g3,1583814514.0,When i couldnt work. I couldnt maintain any type of focus except on my intrusive thoughts. I was almost going catatonic at work and my anxiety was so high my skin would start burning and my eyes felt so dry they wouldnt stop watering.
schizophrenia,fk29lv1,t3_fg2nhb,1583796115.0,Just turn on the radio and dont focus on things out of your control. Theres no reason to worry all the time. Just relax and feel good. Theres a million things out of your control but you can try to relax and focus on breathing. Your alive and this place can suck but theres alot to enjoy.
schizophrenia,fk29cxp,t3_fftzbd,1583795960.0,Delusions wrap themself around you and can suffocate you if you let them. When it happens to me i just lay in bed and think about what it feels like to be normal and not be worried about things that arent really happening. I focus on feeling good like how i used to when i was a kid and breathing. I just try to relax now and not let mania get intertwined with the delusion because it turns into a 3 ring circus.
schizophrenia,fk2920k,t3_fg3e1c,1583795769.0,I used to get fight really bad “nothings wrong with me” and i knew i was sick i just didnt want to admit it to anyone else. Now when i have an episode all i want is help. Admitting theres an issue can help alot because if your willing to be a lab rat you might find a med that works. I was on about 7 diff meds until i found latuda and it really works.
schizophrenia,fk28tho,t3_fg2qa1,1583795618.0,You dont know you have it until you have it and then you might not even realize you have it because your delusions can become so strong. Just find something you like doing and dont focus on the things you cant control. Dont worry about it unless it happens.
schizophrenia,fk28ip1,t3_fg0jej,1583795429.0,"I spent thanksgiving, christmas, and new years in the psych ward once then got hit with an 8 k bill because it spanned over two different years. I disputed the bill on my credit and it was removed. Wasnt a good stay but awesome i got it removed. I was stable after 7 days and they kept me almost 3 months."
schizophrenia,fk27lrs,t1_fk1x7py,1583794853.0,Yeah i pace too. Thats my big sign. I told myself months ago “if it happens again im not pushing through it. Im not going on a 20 mile bike ride. Im not maxing out my caffeine intake. Im laying in bed and breathing.” My plan paid off and it actually worked.
schizophrenia,fk1vjl0,t1_fk1o4fw,1583787702.0,I feel better now. It started at like 5pm sunday night and went to about 3pm today. I dont show it at all i just get so mentally worked up i go like catatonic at work.
schizophrenia,fjejzgp,t1_fjejiqc,1583273139.0,Yeah the moment i started really reading the bible i started hearing so many voices and got really delusional about end times etc etc. ignoring religion entirely and taking science as science and math as math cut out the worst of my delusions. The funny part was growing up i didnt take any religion serious and then i got down on my luck and started turning places for hope and it brought the worst out in me.
schizophrenia,fjejjei,t3_fd07ko,1583272883.0,I just call the whole thing intrusive thoughts and try not think about it that much
schizophrenia,fjeh4iz,t3_fcze2d,1583271554.0,I shut down the whole religion/philosophy train the moment i came out of one of my delusional episodes. No matter what religion it is it came to being way before modern science. I just take facts for what they are now and quit searching for “meaning”. You can still be a great person without a cult saying “this is the way”. I made safety a priority and it helped alot.
schizophrenia,fjdhujg,t3_fcvwgx,1583253004.0,When im in a delusional episode i take alot of videos of myself which makes it ten times worse. When im out of psychosis i go back and watch the videos and its like im watching an entirely different person. Makes me super nauseous.
schizophrenia,fjdhpg9,t3_fcq4oe,1583252934.0,What meds are you on? I noticed zyprexa and invega made my life intolerable. Latuda seems to finally be my savior
schizophrenia,fjdhjn7,t3_fcw060,1583252856.0,I cut out all religion. Helped me get past alot of delusions
schizophrenia,fh9q3xn,t1_fh98xys,1581387066.0,Latuda seems like my dream drug right now but i only started 2 weeks ago so we’ll have to see how it turns out
schizophrenia,fh9q1qv,t1_fh98xys,1581387028.0,I couldnt sweat at all. My muscles were as ridgid as could be. After 10 reps i couldnt even move my arms. It was a nightmare. I always fet nauseous too
schizophrenia,fh6qmww,t3_f1d14a,1581303704.0,I did the keto diet while on invega sustenna and lost the 15 lbs i gained on it in 25 days. Ive recently switched to latuda and i like it alot. Weight neutral as well. Ive been on and off medication and each time off its led to a hospitalization. Im sticking it out with latuda and i feel fine working out with taking this at night. There was no shot of me working out on the invega shot. Keto works though you should try it.

schizophrenia,ff1lq8u,t1_ff1kchf,1579481245.0,I would get paranoid here and there smoking and then finally i was paranoid every time i smoked and i smoked alot... i was like “ok i didnt smoke im not high  ill be fine” and i was fine until i got to about 24 and had my first full time job. I had no idea how much you needed your brain for a 40 hour workweek until it was to late. I fried whatever in my brain that made me sane for high school. 40 hours a week pushed me to self destruct the moment i realized how much work that was.
schizophrenia,ff1khaf,t1_ff1ixgq,1579480642.0,I could deal with 20 hour work weeks medication free because theres still a sense of freedom and i could think without attachment to servitude. 40 hour work weeks are like trying to break an anvil with a tooth brush.
schizophrenia,ff1k1pf,t1_ff1ixgq,1579480432.0,"I have a decent job too with really good pay and i still couldnt imagine having any type of life with a family or kids simply because i couldnt afford them. Median salary in the states you can barely afford to live as a single person and you still have to remember theres ALOT of people making less than you. Its just obscene people still turn to politicians, leaders, celebrities for guidance. I didnt realize how stupid most people are until i got into the real world and i had to work with and for them. I just want seperate from the American celebrity worshippers. Its like the whole worlds not going to wake up until its to late. I believe most of my episodes are caused by my brain realizing i understand there could be a solution while no one else does and then it acts out to attract attention so i can make my point heard but then i almost go catatonic because im in shock at how obscenely blind everyone is."
schizophrenia,ff1h6z7,t1_ff12p7b,1579479165.0,I think smoking synthetic marijuana in college was partially to blame for me... as soon as things went south with sports for me in college my highs turned into trips and i had my first auditory hallucination while on it..
schizophrenia,ff1gi41,t1_ff0v146,1579478861.0,Yeah i work from home now and before when i had an episode i just would leave and go on fmla/disability... this time i tried working through it and i couldnt even sustain a conversation... very embarrassed... supervisor didnt say anything about the calls and i was able to come back to work... i thought for sure i was getting fired this time.
schizophrenia,ff1g2nt,t1_ff0yyyq,1579478664.0,Yeah thats kind of what happened to me. Suddenly i was like... im a slave making other people rich and i have no way out for 40 years

schizophrenia,ff0nbmg,t3_er1k5l,1579470511.0,Olanzapine was my most disliked AP... im obsessed with staying in shape and i gained 50 lbs on it in 3 months... hated it... the only thing AP’s ever did to me sexually was destroy how much semen i produced... less cleanup tho bahaha
BipolarReddit,fev5b4j,t3_eqih2j,1579393275.0,Yeah and then i have a conversation with someone and become delusional im a supreme being and everyone is beneath me because im super speed.
schizophrenia,feutqff,t3_ecigcy,1579389798.0,Everyones crazy in their own way. Theres nothing in stone that says “this is normal”
schizophrenia,fet6vk1,t3_eqhh18,1579372324.0,The tricky thing with psych is your diagnoses can switch 10 times over 10 years. Theres no physical testing. They only force meds on you if youre involuntarily committed to a hospital.
schizophrenia,fem4dm5,t1_felwfpe,1579239358.0,"Yeah thats what i started thinking at one point like no shot is my brain imagining these voices. There has to be some type of alternate connection. Either to other people, the universe, the dead, heaven, hell, etc etc. Growing up i never took schizophrenia serious but now having it im like woah.  It doesnt just go away like i imagined it as a kid."
schizophrenia,fem48ur,t1_felw4b5,1579239230.0,Yeah i know. At this point i stay away but i know the moment i get off meds im getting flung into that delusion entirely and i start making zero sense to everyone else but myself. I just cant explain why i think that way off meds now. That alone drives me insane when i am stable. I almost want to get off meds just for how euphoric some moments are in that delusion. It almost feels like i have it all figured out but the moment i try to tell anyone i almost get catatonic because i realize the puzzle pieces arent fitting together as i say it.
bipolar,feluvge,t3_epoic0,1579231518.0,I bought john lennon sunglasses and wore them on like a super serious biker trail everyday until i got hospitalized smh.
schizophrenia,felsazq,t3_epo0pp,1579229702.0,Hospitalizations are the worst because if its involuntary you have no control over what med youre getting. What i do now is if i know im having a breakdown and im starting to get delusional cant sleep etc etc ill admit myself. Instead of 2 months they only keep you for a few days and you pretty much get to choose your med.
schizophrenia,felrs71,t1_fejvq1p,1579229343.0,I kept smelling like rubbing alcohol and i thought i was seeing people kill themselves by drinking rubbing alcohol. Also i smelt a chicken coup and i have no idea how i knew what it smelt like because i never smelt a chicken coup before. I thought there were people from like alternate dimensions messing with me because of it.
schizophrenia,felrmuw,t1_felacao,1579229243.0,Yeah i recently deleted my facebook. Id go on rants that made perfect sense to me and no sense to anyone else. I get sick thinking about it.
schizophrenia,felrj3b,t1_felfweb,1579229173.0,Mostly internal day dreams that i had tactile hallucinations with. I did become obsessed with one visual hallucination of a star that came and dissapeared and i thought it had some type of higher meaning on why it would come and it was somehow attached to my thoughts.
schizophrenia,fel10av,t1_fejugk1,1579211735.0,Yeah dealing with police when your like that is terrifying. They look at you like youre a straight up murderer and thats how youre treated
schizophrenia,feizhvc,t1_feiz8j9,1579151652.0,Its just so crazy its so stigmatized im just like “anyone but me please” i just pretend like it never happened. What happens in vegas stays in vegas.

schizophrenia,fefun6n,t1_fefuhyo,1579065739.0,Yeah pop and potato chips were a killer for me. They have these quest chips on amazon that helped me.
schizophrenia,fefukfg,t1_fefugae,1579065669.0,No dude it worked for me. I lost weight quick. The only thing that was weird was my hair got really dry. I guess its because of loss in biotin. I used to have dreams about eating cookies and milk whilw i was on it too. Lol your constantly hungry the first two weeks but it goes away
schizophrenia,fefud25,t1_fefu5k2,1579065482.0,Try keto man. It sucks if you never did it before but on keto i lost 50 lbs in 3 months. I hadnt felt that alive in 5 years. Amazon has all you need.
Latuda,fefu5it,t1_feftz1j,1579065293.0,I only get minor weight gain on invega but still enough to make me insane. I was on zyprexa for 3 months and gained 40 lbs. i didnt even know there were weight neutral meds and it pissed me off no one told me about them because that was my main concern at every appointment. I went on geodon got back to my pre diagnoses weight then had a break down and asked for invega because i knew id get stable. I shouldve just asked for latuda because i knew about it but i never tried it and i just wanted to feel better.
schizophrenia,feftyec,t3_eox9by,1579065114.0,I just had a 40 minute argument with my NP to get me off invega and on latuda as well. I cant do weight gain. I become completely obsessed with my weight. Congrats!
Latuda,fefh1fw,t1_fecsao5,1579056156.0,It just makes me mad all these years of my number one issue  of weight gain my doctor goes “yeah latudas weight neutral” and im just like “after fucking 3 years of hellish nightmarish weight gain now you tell me this”
schizophrenia,feecz7y,t1_fee2qr0,1579031206.0,Yeah when they come on its unreal. Its scary not being in control of it.
schizophrenia,fecqosv,t3_eo9jla,1578981081.0,When im having an episode my memory is shit... ill get out of the hospital open my phone and itll be like the hangover movie... ill watch all my vids and look at my pics and i have 0 memory of them... its so cringe to me it makes my stomach hurt... lol im always super scared of who i ran into during an episode and pray to god i didnt do anything to crazy...
schizophrenia,fecqh5e,t3_eodyqo,1578980881.0,My delusions/ loss in reality would always just dissapear... once i got stable i was back to my normal thinking like right away... one day id wake up after a hospitalization and have rational thinking back like boom... itd just be there... its really frustrating to me because i cant force myself to feel this way off meds... id just love to be normal again and not have 10% of my day revolved around thinking about having a mental illness
schizophrenia,fecqbfc,t3_eodyyw,1578980731.0,I always had rough nights when i was a kid... overthinking etc.... no schizophrenic stuff... itd be gone in the morning... i was in my mid 20’s when i started waking up in the morning just completely lost on calm thinking... it would feel like i didnt sleep at all and id have racing thoughts so bad... when it wouldnt go away thats when i started doing crazy stuff and getting hospitalized
schizophrenia,fecpn0e,t1_fecpa5h,1578980123.0,I alienate myself when it starts. I get real bad anxiety with it because im like “god why am i thinking about this right now”. Being alone helps. I geton  reddit just browse and forget about it.
schizophrenia,fecp7qh,t3_eog3ps,1578979747.0,Yeah i get the same thing. Im not angry or anything tho i just repitiously think of the worst case scenario which is my physically attacking someone else in public. I know i never will i just wish i didnt have these intrusive thoughts
schizophrenia,fecmdxr,t3_eod88c,1578977501.0,Bro sign her into a mental ward. It sucks the first time but its good to get it out of the way. They’ll come get her.
schizophrenia,fecm6ja,t3_eodyyw,1578977351.0,The scariest thing for me when “it” started was i couldnt will myself through it. I was totally in control and then within four days reality was gone for me. Id seek help and be truthful. Try a weight neutral med first so you dont have a horrible time through the beginning processes
schizophrenia,feclvzn,t3_eof6pg,1578977141.0,Yeah ive had that. My obsessions/delusions werent ever healthy. I always seemed to get away from there after switching meds.
schizophrenia,feclp5o,t3_eog8qg,1578977003.0,Some hallucinations were awesome for me. It was literally like i had dr strange super powers. A few episodes i could trigger what i wanted my hallucinations to be but after a few days i would loae control of them and it turned into a hellish alice in wonderland.
BipolarReddit,fe03j32,t1_fe02kde,1578802165.0,Its not a bad med like i feel fine on it other than exercise. The moment i start lifting or even think about lifting my muscles become super rigid. I also have moderate weight gain on it. I gained 10-15 lbs and kind of peaked there. When i was on zyprexa i probably wouldve ended up at 300 lbs.
schizophrenia,fe02pzu,t3_engn0f,1578801592.0,Mines weight gain.... everytime i get off its because im super obsessed with my weight. Growing up all i did was exercise six pack ripped gym and more gym and then i had to start taking meds. Thats my only problem with it.
schizophrenia,fe02jx3,t3_enhhgr,1578801469.0,I recently admitted myself for the first time instead of being forced by the police. I was experiencing the same thing. I was doing really well and was on a low dose of geodon and lost all the weight i gained. I drank one night and all the symptoms returned. Super manic highs and lows so bad i started hallucinating with delusions. Instead of 2 months in the psych ward i spent 8 days because i voluntarily went. Maybe switch up the meds just to get stable again
BipolarReddit,fe01ncf,t1_fe019y5,1578800845.0,Geodon i had no problem with exercise so im hoping its similar
BipolarReddit,fe01h9d,t3_enem6l,1578800734.0,I always refer to my meds as my “sleep meds” lol.
BipolarReddit,fe01cgd,t3_enhd7m,1578800646.0,I was on geodon and lost all this weight and got back to myself on it. I wish i couldve stayed on it but with my diagnoses i also struggled with alcohol and i drank to celebrate the weight loss and went crazy and had to get back on invega sustena. Switching medication can be tough especially when you find one you like. If its an insurance issue you may want to contact your local county assistance office. I work a full time job and sometimes there can be medical insurance assistance with a disability.
BipolarReddit,fdomssi,t1_fdny14h,1578608339.0,I could do pretty much any med its just the fucking bullshit weight gain lol. That makes me feel better though thank you!
