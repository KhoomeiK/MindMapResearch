He ended up breaking up with me because he ""might"" want kids one day, and we'd just be postponing the inevitable if we stayed together. 

He broke my heart and we hadn't been together for nearly as long as you have with your wife. 

Keeping secrets, especially about something this big is not okay. Your wife is going to be devastated but if you hope to spend your life with her, it's better she hears it from you, now, rather than any other way.

This is the best quote that has been getting me through that feeling of not knowing who I am, but also not really wanting to go back to exactly who I was before because to be honest, that person was still very sad, distressed, and had a lot of work to do. 

You can get there. Find affirmations that work for you and write them somewhere you'll see every day so you can verbally tell it to yourself- in front of a mirror is a good place. If you tell yourself something enough times, you will start to believe it. We do this often with negative thoughts, but it's a bit harder to do with positive ones. We need to stick with it and force ourselves to do it because it doesn't fall naturally yet. The good news is, it takes 21 days to form a habit. Slowly but surely, it will become second nature to love yourself. 

""Love what is.""
""I love myself.""
""You're doing amazing.""
""Please remember to eat today, your body loves you.""
""I am healthy.""
""I am healing.""
""I am strong.""
""I can do this.""

You can do this."

OP, YTA. Please look into getting help for yourself as well."
monogamy,fj944ci,t3_fbsh1p,1583131425.0,"It's a popular idea to cheat on someone because a lot of the media is run by men. This is a theory I have but it's interesting- think about things like razors, that were originally intended for men only, and somewhere along the line women were told their body hair was unacceptable. Now, women are so self conscious about their body hair and this is because of something the media conditioned onto us. (Razors weren't making enough money from just men and as soon as they were marketed toward women, they blew up). 

Now, let's take a look at monogamy/cheating. Every person is different. There are a lot of women that would like to be in poly relationships or just be promiscuous, which is perfectly fine. But we're told that men are just ""wired that way"". Or ""it's just nature"" for them to be attracted to every woman they see. It's false. This is a fake story told by men that are quite frankly gross and want to get away with being gross. 

Watch pretty much any Hollywood rom-com and it lines up with that narrative. ""Hall Pass"" is an especially cringe worthy movie aimed at letting men get away with being pigs. I guess I don't know, because I'm not a man, but from my experience not all men are like that and they resent being grouped up together. 

Sexuality is a spectrum. There are people that love to have sex, and there are people that don't like sex at all! I think we forget about people in the middle (monogamy) often because both of the extremes feel like they need to be heard so badly, they can sometimes call down something that feels natural for a lot of people. 

As long as you are on the same page with your partner, have open communication, and trust, no matter where you are on that spectrum, you're going to be fine."
