sexover30,fr4t45k,t3_gmguzf,1589896343.0,"i love this question because I have thought about this so much. Anyone that wants to comment, please do!

I only have seen sex in porn, even at 30 years old. It wasn't something we talked about growing up. I learned a little at a time as I grew up. I have diagnosed vaginismus (I have no control of those muscles; sometimes it is a mental thing, sometimes physical, or even both) and i have never been able to have penetrative sex before. When I got my IUD, I was put under at the hospital and my gyno inserted it there. Insurance actually paid for it because it is on record for so long.

Anyway, I worry so much that I am so inexperienced because I can't (right now) have penetrative sex, and I don't know what it's supposed to look like. (when the porn stars are in fake positions so we can see through the camera) I'm also very shy, but my sex drive is 100% there. Anyway, I worry about this, I don't know how to get that life experience."

She has a kid at home, and him blocking her from pics on instagram, and talking to so many girls like he did, would not be the behavior I think she would want for her child's father figure to have. Her friends, even her male one, told her very bluntly that there were a lot of red flags. She also believed him when he lied and said that his son's mother would be okay with him taking his son to the US back with him. I knew right away there was no way that could be true. No way.

When Ash's ex confirmed that, Avery kept calling his lying ""sugar coating the situation."" He can't communicate, he's emotionally immature to say the least, and he lies. When she tries to have a REAL conversation (I definitely give her a lot of credit for that) he always causes a tantrum like a child. She doesn't need that being a single mother. Idk why his ex and Avery were both singing his praises so much. And his ""we're not even in a relationship!"" before he starts blinking like crazy and speaking rapidly, really shows what kind of person he is. I guess my complaints really are with Ash, and I could be a little less harsh, but she knows better and  in 5 years, she is going to look back at this chapter in her life with the ""What was I thinking??"" mentality. Okay, I am giving her more credit then I did even in the beginning of this same comment.

Like, every little argument or annoyance is conveyed to the mother, and so the mother not only dislikes Maggie by hearing one side only (and only the bad) but she could have felt threatened by Maggie because her control was being slipped away, and she was starting to not be the number one woman in his life. It's gross, but it happens.

Then I think though, that OP was shocked about his wife's reaction so I assume if all of this is new to him, it can't be just like this either. I wish we knew what was missing."
relationship_advice,fqrlimj,t1_fqrh2es,1589586784.0,"It affected Maggie, who he sees as family, when she doesn't even really have her own.

And not saying anything and keeping things swept under the rug will never work long term. She's also a horrible person, like the OP, that took part in a massive betrayal to someone that doesn't deserve it. The difference is, he owes this new girl no loyalty. He can still have a relationship with his son, but he has every right to voice how he feels about this, AND say that he will not normalize cheating behavior and pretend like everything is okay when it isn't. That is way more than just a lifestyle difference. An open relationship or an unconventional one, may be, but infidelity is a disgusting action that shouldn't be tolerated. It is also majorly enabling OP's son by not calling him out on it. (basically, the way that OP's wife reacted) It can't become normalized."
relationship_advice,fqrkhg8,t1_fqrcqz7,1589586181.0,"It's become so normalized today, that cheating is really not THAT bad, because it is so likely to occur.

If you have a consensual open relationship, or something like that where everyone agrees, it might not be MY thing, but i can get on board with that I suppose. but when it is presented as a monogamous and/or serious relationship, where lying and deep betrayals are a part of the cheating/affair, it is never okay or justified to me. I think humans can very much have a happy monogamous relationship. It just takes maturity, work, honesty, and commitment from both partners.

relationship_advice,fqriljh,t1_fqrg0tg,1589585084.0,"Agreed. And when I see parents who enable the cheating behavior without saying anything, it seems to only get worse for the parents.

The fact that the OP is so concerned and saying, even if it's against the common opinion, that his son is wrong and that he betrayed Maggie, and that's not going to just be swept under the rug like all of those years didn't happen....really show good parenting imo. Yes, he's an adult, but being held accountable by your friends and family is still so important if you are doing the wrong thing. OP, please keep us updated and don't listen to the terrible advice, like you don't have the right to be upset or concerned. Mabe ask some of his friends that you are on closer terms with, or look her up on facebook. I come from a similar situation as Maggie, and not only would the betrayal hurt me so much, but having somebody care as much as the OP does, basically being the father for her that she never had, would mean everything to me.

pettyrevenge,fqrh9yb,t1_fqq26th,1589584331.0,"OMG, so I work in pharmacy and I am always telling customers about magnesium. A lot of times I can tell that they are just humoring me, and it makes me so mad because they asked me for help and I know that their cause is a magnesium deficiency. They want to be told it's something much more serious sometimes. 

ALSO, to those that take melatonin for sleep, I highly recommend magnesium instead. It's just as effective, if not more. Also, a big part of the population is magnesium deficient and they don't know it. Melatonin can also build up in the body in a way that magnesium can't, assuming the person takes too much. It's also AMAZING for inflammation in the body and can help kill bacteria like candida (yeast infections) much quicker. 

That's why it helps with muscle pain, it really helps with the inflammation, allowing it to heal with minimum pain. Lately, I see all of these ""hip"" and ""cool"" vitamins and vitamin drinks that are supposed to be all natural. When I look at the 1st two ingredients, it's ALWAYS magnesium, and  now it's suddenly become ""cool,"" as some vitamins sometimes become. It's all overpriced, just get magnesium pills, take it at night, and give it some time (a few weeks) to work. 

Oh, it's also why epsom salts are wonderful for injuries. It's basically magnesium in another form. It's a miracle vitamin (technically mineral, but whatever) and you don't have to buy a bunch of expensive products to have access to it.

After the accident, many people called the ambulance. I groaned, but I knew the pain in my stomach was definitely not normal. The bruises were also black, I've never seen bruising look so bad anymore. Anyway, the ambulance bill was around $1,000 USD alone, the one night I stayed in the hospital along with one test, was around 4-5k too. And my car was totalled, so for a year and a half while i saved for a car that was much much less in value than my old car, I had to constantly worry how i was going to go anywhere. Oh, I had fluid leaking out of my intestines according to the test, after hitting the steering wheel so hard. (I sit so close to the wheel because I'm so short, only 4'11 and I can't see otherwise) But they didn't give me anything special to rack up the costs. I had to stay for ""observation."" Another thing to keep in mind for that outrageous bill, is that it was not only one night, but I was sharing the room with a really old, cranky lady that told me to be quiet, when I was taking to my mom on the phone at 8 PM that night. Our healthcare is also so bad too, that I could tell that, that lady had been there for a very long time, probably not having family that could/would take her. She was on the dirty side and neglected. I remember she called the nurse like 4 times, one time in the morning, and they finally came in and went straight to me, fawning over if I needed a blanket. I was young, in good spirits, and not hard to deal with. I felt terrible for the lady as we both said around the same time that she had called them and that she needed help going to the bathroom. They left her there to just lie there and do nothing. I know I won't let it happen to my mom when she gets older. There are SO many flaws with our system, and our high costs, only being one of many.  

Yeah, if an ambulance can ever be avoided, I know that I'm not the only one that does that. It's so unreal for emergency transport services to be so expensive.

he's ""telling"" you that you need to pay for an xbox, but you two are married, so that's essentially money for the family and food for everyone, including the baby (which I know babies can be expensive.) That was a response you would give a roommate or even a girlfriend/boyfriend. Not your spouse. And you said you overreacted about Tippy and his response? I can't disagree with you more. Tippy is a living, breathing animal that RELIES on YOU! And you in a way, only enforced his behavior and his idea that what he did about Tippy was okay, by buying him a new console. Feeding his addiction even more. 

Neglecting the baby is RUINING her during this developing time. She's just ""put away"" all day with nobody to help her. She's not learning anything or interacting with the family. Even with the COVID, they have stuff on the computer. You need to hire a nanny that has experience with babies and development. Tippy, the baby, and even your son are being neglected for a console. Those three need you. Please do some research on google to see about babies and what is so important to them at 6 months old. Please!

Lastly, is his behavior and video game obsession, not repulse you? Like, it would turn me off so much, and just being around him would make me feel so resentful that you work so hard only to go back home to that situation. And sleeping next to him WHEN he decides to actually stop playing, I just don't see the appeal. He isn't helping with the care of your children properly or Tippy, so what is the point of him being there? He's like a parasite that just feeds and takes, giving nothing back. You deserve so much better OP. If that isn't enough to change your mind, don't you think your child, your baby, and Tippy deserve better?"

First of all, you can turn your head any way you want. Some people really do turn their head to the left. That is not ""wrong"" nor does it make you a bad kisser. Also, when you start using the tongue and things are getting really serious, don't be too shy to try things and ""explore,"" but make sure your kiss is not too wet. Slobbery kissers are the worst, and nobody wants saliva all over their face when they are done kissing. But again, don't be so afraid that you barely try or barely use your tongue at all. Again, that was my problem. I still don't think I am the best, but I have definitely gotten better in time, and I now know why everyone would always say that it's nothing big to worry about. The more you do it, the better you will get.

I don't think you did anything wrong based on your story. It's okay to be shy, and i know saying, ""Just be confident!"" is not going to magically make you confident.

When you go into a hospital and you're diagnosed with something terrible, they are going to treat you how they legally can, methods which have been proven to cure or at least help fight said problem...all of those methods that are approved by the FDA. That is our country's standard for something being proven to cure, treat, alleviate, etc. If it is not, there is NO proof.  

That malaria drug has not been proven or accepted by not only the FDA, but no major medical University (Emory, John Hopkins, etc) has endorsed even the idea of it as well. The scientific community is pretty much in agreement with this. It has also been the cause of death for people who have taken too much. By bringing this up, you are the one who is making this political. I am not surprised; I know what the scientific community says. You can laugh at your little joke of making up a condition because I don't agree with what you are saying (backed by no medical data) but then again, it wouldn't be the first thing he and his supporters have made up. 

This article, if you actually read the entire piece, has a timeline of when it started to be promoted by the President.

He doesn't want his bone spurs to be of even more risk) and now this. he is going against every doctor in the major fields that are saying no. I believe the doctors. Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has been wonderful throughout all of this, is an immunologist and a practicing physician for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He is the one that first led the research when the AIDS epidemic was at that point, so out of hand.

AmItheAsshole,fpd9eid,t1_fo7ae07,1588522523.0,"I agree with you, that the kid won't forget. the first dog that was ever ""mine,"" that I was responsible for, was a rescue corgi when I was 11. I loved that dog, he was my life, I still don't love any human as much as I loved my corgi. I was being heavily abused at home by my father, and my corgi was my only friend. He would run alongside me when I went rollerblading, biking, etc. We did everything together!

When I was maybe 13 or 14, my mom was suddenly admitted to the hospital and she almost died. (longer story than this one, lol) My abusive father became even worse, each day was just such torture. A few days before my mom got sick, the guy that cut our grass sprayed roundup all in the front yard. He even left a note to my father to not let me and my dog play in the front yard for a few days. On one of the days that my mom was in the hospital, he wanted to let my corgi out through the front door. I immediately said no, because he was a runner, and VERY hard to catch. the only way was to trick him, and each way would only work once. My father had done this several times, being such an idiot and having no consequences as my abuser. I was the one that spent hours chasing him, every single time. My father would just go back inside. 

He let my corgi out through the front door and physically would not allow me to get to him. I was starting to panic, because i needed to stay close enough so he wouldn't get lost. I think at that point, my father just wanted to assert his ""power"" and ""show me"" that he could do whatever he wanted. I FINALLY caught my corgi. The very next day, e was SUPER sick. I wasn't even grossed out, I was just so worried about him. The end of his white snout even turned bright red. For days, I had to spend a few hours cleaning his blankets and washing/sanitizing his cage, just for him to do it again. He was getting sicker and sicker. I BEGGED my father to take him to the vet. Like, I was pleading on the floor, anything to get him to take him. He kicked me once and scoffed as he walked away. He was very good at keeping me away from talking to my mom, not just alone, but at all.

I was so lucky and my mom was released earlier than expected. When we got home, she took one single look at my corgi, and was horrified. ""We need to take him to the vet, NOW!"" as I told her what had happened, and by then i found the sign about the roundup. We took him to the Emergency Vet Clinic, and they said indeed, that he was poisoned by running around or eating something covered in that roundup. She also told us that he MIGHT have made it two more days at the most, if we had never taken him. He was dying. My father only cared about himself the entire time I knew him, and had no empathy towards my sick dog. The emergency vet had to keep him for about a week if I remembered correctly. I would have NEVER forgiven my father if my precious dog had died a preventable, slow painful death, that HE caused. My dog lived until I was 26. It's been years, but I still mourn over him and have his pictures alongside my current animals. I plant roses for him on his birthday because he loved running in flowers, things like that.

The COVID is way more contagious, there is no cure or treatment, and there is no preventative measures we can take. Hospitals ARE being overfilled, I work in Pharmacy, and we all kind of know each other, and that's what I am hearing from them. my best friend who works at one in Atlanta, is working 16-18 hour shifts without a break.

AND if we go back in history, this is not well known, but we see that before the Spanish Flu got its name, and started killing people in masses, there was actually a first wave of the same Flu after WWI. It killed a massive amount of people too, it just hit much harder the second time around. i don't know this for sure, but I highly suspect that we are in the ""first wave"" of COVID, and that there will be a second wave.

Your son essentially wants to cry and scream like he's 3, with no consequences for the tantrum OR neglecting them. He's super lucky that you took them up instead of releasing them (that's horrible when people do that) or back to the pet store. Your son is too immature to have a pet.

This should also be a lesson to all parents that KNOW their kid won't take care of the pet, but get them one anyway (not talking about you, OP) and then, surprise surprise! The family ends up giving the dog back or taking them to the pound to die. Sometimes it happens more than once from the same family. No. Pets are for life and they need you to care for them.

She also had a place to stay, which so many people would love to have a friend offer them something like that. Then she disrespects her in her own home that she pays for. It's not Jasmine's fault that her family is crazy. (if he is giving us an accurate account of them) He said she was the normal one, meaning that he doesn't consider her as bad as her family. Maybe she is a people pleaser and was trying to make both her family and OP happy. At least she didn't let any family members move in. (We see that all the time on reddit) She waited for him patiently, agreed to temporarily forget planning the wedding she was so excited about, and was willing to stay with him despite the baby. AND like I said in my first comment, she never expected him to abandon the baby or not see her. I don't agree with Jasmine doing that because she deserves better, but he had no idea how lucky he was. You can always talk yourself into anything if you want it to be so, badly enough. He didn't love Cinnamon. He stayed with Jasmine the whole time Cinnamon was pregnant. I don't get that either, why she was okay with that AND accepted him when he chose her over his fiancee at the end. She must have been desperate for a man and to have that ""family image"" that so many people strive for, not understanding that sometimes no matter how much you want something, sometimes it just doesn't happen. And you can't have that perfect family with a toxic partner. I hope Jasmine is super happy with her life and blocks OP from all aspects of her life."

Colt is just so jabba-the-hut-like kind of gross. His personality reflected what was on the outside. The only thing I can tolerate when he and Debbie are on the show, is when they show the cats.

tifu,foxza77,t1_fovpdw5,1588161141.0,"Thank you!! I don't get the downvotes I'm receiving, just because I'm criticizing a man that cheated on his fiance and got another woman pregnant. If a woman had cheated on her fiance and gotten pregnant, I would be just as angry. He just seems to not care, and is justifying his hurtful actions on the stress of her family. Either way, we as adults choose our behavior and he chose to betray his wife for the woman that she agreed to open her home for. Humanity is lessening in our society day by day."
AmItheAsshole,fovmkss,t3_g9m87x,1588103856.0,"NTA- You never HAVE to cook for anybody if you don't want to, unless it's like for your child or someone you are responsible for.

That sounds so frustrating and I am a picky eater myself. In my last serious relationship, my boyfriend cooked almost everything because he's great at cooking and baking. He is half French and half Cuban (he didn't move to the US until high school and English is his third language) I clarify to emphasize how much culture played into what he cooked. He was really good at cooking things I liked, but we compromised. For example, to placate my tastes, he asked me to name 10 non dessert foods I like, that I can just come up with. he went from there and our first homemade dinner together was this chicken broccoli dish that was so amazing. He slowly started introducing French food into his cooking. I compromised by saying that if he ever wanted to cook something that he wanted, but knew I would not eat (like seafood or pork) to not let me stop him. I would just find something else, but we would still eat together. I also promised to at least TRY some new foods which was very difficult for me. He compromised by not asking me to try new meats or cuts of meats. (I'm not a vegetarian, but I'm weird with the little meat I do eat and I do love veggies) French dishes are very cream and sauce based, so he would save a small portion without the meat in it for me. I learned about so many foods this way. 

He would also take me to his parent's house where they ALL cooked very well and we would just have this fusion of great food, from scratch pastries and cakes, and expensive wines and spirits. (his father was very proud to introduce me to the wine world, it's his culture and I'm so grateful for the life experience, that he did) I also was extra adamant to not let my pickiness disturb ANYTHING they wanted or planned. I never complained and they were great. By the end of our relationship, I would actually join him in cooking if we were at their house. 

At our house, i always helped with desserts or gaufres (belgian waffles) If the dessert came from a French book, he would just translate verbally and tell me what to do. He made it fun. But I also compromised, and she needs to compromise too. Don't expect her to eat foods that are on top of her most hated list (like, I have a thing with texture and everyone knows that I won't ever eat bananas in any form) but bland foods aren't fun for anybody. Maybe she can pick out spices that she's never tried before? Like at a World Market or something, if she is into other countries. And maybe start telling her that she needs to start coming up with her own dinners if she isn't going to eat with you. You can't always cook what she wants or cook something completely different. She should be super thankful to be with a guy that loves to cook. I was, and I miss my ex's cooking to be honest lol. Sorry for my long answer. It's just some ideas I thought. Don't break up with her, give it a chance and know that you are not wrong OP. I wish you the best!"

Frasier,forky1b,t1_foir915,1588013974.0,"That part KILLED me. And how when she left, the episode ends with Martin holding Eddie close. I had my own dog that I got when I was 11 years old, and I named him after Niles actually!!! We were so close because I was abused heavily as a child when I did have a father around and I couldn't tell anybody. He was an esteemed and well loved high school teacher and I was in the haze of abuse. my corg was my best friend, my EVERYTHING, and I obsessed over his death. I always said that it was my biggest fear, losing him. If I had to do some kind of introduction, I would say my name and then say, ""I really love my dog! I mean it! I LOVE my dog..."" and then ramble about him. I also got one of my highest grades in one of my college literature classes for writing about him. I wrote about my fears for him getting older, and that I literally could not picture a life without him. I prayed all the time to not ""take him away from me."" When I was 26 he passed away very suddenly with a stroke. I held him in my arms as he took his last breath, and I didn't even know he had just died. He was my Eddie, and so I get so emotional about Martin's wonderful bond with Eddie. He makes the show even than it is. I'm sorry for my rambling, it just still haunts me to this day and I did name him after Niles."

AmItheButtface,forjp68,t1_fop0i2d,1588013375.0,"When you hear that the woman carrying your child is in labor, you drop EVERYTHING and immediately go to her. it doesn't matter how early it is in the labor, you go. If you are in the hospital or something, I understand those situations. But the second he got that first call, he should have been out that door before the phone call was even over. 

And she had a stillborn baby already!! That's HORRIFYING, something i could never fathom in my worst nightmares. She was so scared that this baby might not make it too. Plus, she's in a lot of pain, hormones are going crazy, and her partner that she needed was nowhere to be found. I don't understand why you think that he isn't in the wrong here."

I still don't understand why you didn't IMMEDIATELY run to your wife after the first call (does she know this?) and I think if I was her, that would be a really hard thing for me to accept. Don't do anything like this again. Dedicate ALL of your time to being the best father you can be, and being a much better husband than you ever have before."

You think you can just come to another subreddit because you got your feelings hurt on the other one and didn't agree with you. The major consensus is overwhelmingly that you are in the wrong, OP. Maybe act like an adult for once and really think that with strangers being angry like this, maybe YOU are the problem. You should have immediately dropped EVERYTHING when you heard she was in labor, and rushed to her side. You stayed??

I understand the family thing. At my work though, if that happened to any of the coworkers, we all would be like, ""LEAVE! Now!! Get out of here and give us updates later"" Your ""buddies"" should have been like ""Wth are you thinking? Get to your wife!"" I don't understand why they didn't.

Your wife will ALWAYS remember this. Even if she ""gets over"" (I hate that term) what happened, the very most, this experience will be a bittersweet one to her. And idk, if I grew up and found out that my dad did that when I was born, I would feel a little resentful. You tried to play ""hero"" to another woman and left your wife to experience trauma alone. She could have died too! What if she had died? Then, you would be the one that didn't get to say goodbye. That coworker's grandfather was probably in a medically induced coma or extremely out of it, to help him get through the pain and everything. I understand wanting to say goodbye, but she could have made the choice herself to possibly get written up, and leave anyway. Usually when you are so short staffed at work, as long as the workers are doing a good job, it's very hard for them to be fired because they are needed.

I will not say anything about the status of your relationship with your wife, but I think she needs personal therapy to get through this, AND couple's therapy with you. Nobody is too good for therapy and hiring a professional to help sort everything out is not something to be ashamed of. You should suggest it to her immediately."

You slept with Cinnamon when Jasmine was asleep?? Your home is supposed to be your sanctuary where you can unwind and get away from stressful things like work (or her family)

 You also say how much you love Cinnamon, but you stayed with Jasmine for so long after finding out. I know you felt guilty, but you had no feelings of love until you got with Cinnamon permanently? And Jasmine never planned on keeping you away from your child, you were only separated because Cinnamon moved far away. I don't think you're in love and I'm sad for your daughter that she has two parents who don't have morals and who thrived on lies and cheating. Jasmine really dodged a bullet, you're beyond awful.

It wasn't the only time we watched it, but that was an almost set time. (like the equivalent of Saturday morning cartoons with a bowl of cereal type thing) I would hold my tongue about how much I didn't want to watch it (I liked it in high school, and even then I liked shoujo anime from my favorite mangas. He likes all the popular ones, but I just couldn't get into any of them.

BDSMAdvice,fomwmy1,t3_g8ai43,1587906122.0,"I have had a similar thing happen to me, but it was a long time ago and we weren't married- your case is much tougher. For background's sake, I come from a very abusive and violent home and it has always affected me too, and I have mental health problems as well. I hate people that lie and/or go back on their word because you have so much to worry about anyway, you should at least have that one person that you know will ALWAYS be honest with you even if it's bad, and if they say they will or won't do something, that they don't let you down.

I totally see why you are feeling betrayed. I would be furious too honestly. I'm only saying this for the fact that you two are married and have a kid, not because I am on his side in any way shape, or form, but: I think you two need to find a kink friendly therapist and go to couples counseling over this. Unless he's put his hands on you or verbally/physically abuses you. (that's an automatic no, no matter what) I think trying it for a few months at least can really help your communication and also help you decide clearly what you really want to do long term. I would insist on it, and he needs to get on board with the idea too. Nobody is too good for therapy and I really think it can improve your entire life and help you confront the problem of his betrayal. I truly wish you the best, OP!"
