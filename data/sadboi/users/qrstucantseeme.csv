AskMen,f526yeg,t1_f523g7n,1571947793.0,Many things. Though I’m not about to list them all in a comment just to prove it. But I do believe I have something(s) to offer.
AskMen,f526kbb,t1_f524itz,1571947692.0,But even ordinary men don’t make the woman they are dating pay for *everything* know wealthy men.
AskMen,f5261qy,t1_f51tgwb,1571947528.0,Well thanks
AskMen,f51sakp,t1_f51qrjx,1571943833.0,That’s odd. Even men who aren’t wealthy don’t make a woman pay for everything.
AskMen,f51s4tl,t1_f51qiwd,1571943786.0,"Thanks for explaining it and just being truthful and nonjudgmental about it. Your answer makes sense, I can sense that it’s definitely harder to get into if you’re just middle class or under. Ah well, thank you though"
AskMen,f51rfom,t1_f51pzfu,1571943575.0,I’m a fair high 8 or 9. Sounds cocky but I don’t mean it to be. I grew up extremely unattractive so I’m aware of how things have changed [for me] over the years. I genuinely like older men so that isn’t a problem.
AskMen,f51r0y0,t1_f51os0x,1571943489.0,"I’m aware, thank you"
AskMen,f51mrr0,t1_f51kz4e,1571942442.0,"Thank you for not judging. That means a lot. I am an SB already but my SD travels a lot so our arrangement isn’t as straight and narrow as other SBs. Additionally, being an SB of color is a little bit more difficult so my options are definitely more limited in terms of the whole “wealthy” world regardless of attractive level. So I’m wondering if there’s a way to gain a genuine (yes, genuine - I won’t just go for anyone despite the fact that they are wealthy. I date older men but there  has to be a connection for me to commit - like anyone else, ya know?) relationship with someone in that world. Being an SB is kind of a simple formula because we have to *look* like SBs which is kind of the first image that comes to mind (very dressed up and very put together) but for a genuine relationship with someone wealthy, is it the same standard? Idk"
AskMen,f51kn8i,t1_f51k2qk,1571941944.0,Simple and perfect answer
AskMen,f51kjjx,t1_f51jvj9,1571941912.0,:) hehe
AskMen,f51kavm,t1_f51jgs9,1571941838.0,"Yup. However, there’s tons of advice and such but really I don’t want to over do it. There’s classy and then there’s *trying* to look classy and looking tacky instead. I’m in college and I’ve got my own life and intend to make my own money with my own career (I have career dreams I’m pursing), however, I’d also like to be apart of a certain lifestyle or be apart of a certain group of people (do they call them “high society” anymore?) and I’d like to go about it correctly in terms of how I present myself. Perhaps it sounds selfish and “gold digger” ish and I’ll get judged for it but it’s the truth, that’s my honesty."

AskMen,f51hqxt,t1_f51gyx2,1571941117.0,"I’m talking strictly aesthetic and what you gravitate towards. Women who make sure every detail about her is in place, hair, nails, make up done (not *over done* but is clearly deliberate in her efforts to look very well put together) vs women who are a bit more relaxed, t-shirt, jeans, hair in bun, nails bare, but however still takes care of herself on a basic level."

2. Everything was white. Himself, the walls, sheets, toilet, food packages, clothes, door. If this room OP has made up is just a basic room with wood floors and beige walls the the sensory deprivation wouldn’t be as staggering and thus possible to maintain a longer stay.
