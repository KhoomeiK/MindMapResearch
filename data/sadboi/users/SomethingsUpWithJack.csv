I’m supported somewhat, but they refuse to read any articles or anything related to MH that I want them to read so maybe I can be better understood, cared for, and handled when I split or hallucinate or am too depressed to live.      I’m told “I don’t like to read” or something similar.     


On one hand I don’t get put down or made fun of, which is nice, and I’m treated like a normal person, which can also be nice.   But I’m not normal, and it eats away at me that they don’t care to just read up on who I am and what affects me.  


I get support in some ways, but everything just feels so superficial to me ... 


I honestly feel I must be expecting too much, that I’m too demanding and selfish for having to request someone read about their broken partner.    Like, “hey here’s a list of how horrible I am, enjoy”. 

I just end up dropping the issue and not really bringing it up anymore... meanwhile more and more issues my partner remains oblivious to keep building up and building up, and it doesn’t matter how much I try and point it out, or try to help them from triggering me...  


They are very , out of sight-out of mind...   I wish I could be so oblivious to things tbh... not have everything eating away at me.  



And it sucks because the one person I shouldn’t have to hide or avoid being open to, I find myself growing further apart from and disinterested.  Not just for this reason, but everything just keeps stacking up...    and I feel I’m not getting the minimal support I need, but I do get SOME, so who am I to complain really? 


I know a lot of it’s internal and not going to change even if I did have overwhelming support, and I’m sure most will be able to relate... but I am so fucking lonely, and I just want someone to have deep conversations with about life, the universe, everything.   


And the average person that I deal with when it comes to mental health, just believes it doesn’t exist, that you can just choose to be “ok” and that’s that.        

Or acknowledging the illness, but then doing nothing positive about it, or just surprised Pikachu face when it acts up :(

But also you were intoxicated to the point you needed to be carried, so I don’t think you should blame yourself too heavily for making a “off” decision you wouldn’t normally make...      

You obviously know more about your relationship dynamic and how both of you normally are while intoxicated, so maybe this is even extremely out of character for you while drunk...  but you also are under a incredible amount of stress and depression right now, add that to the fact your emotional regulation on your best days is probably shit, I mean.. you’re dealing with a fuck load right now.          

I hope despite him feeling abandoned and slighted, he will understand this and you both can move past it.

It’s good she’s making some progress in some areas she has had troubles with, and I’m sorry to hear she’s having inpatient.  


Have you talked to your roommate about any of this? What is their take? Do they know you have BPD? 


You say she’s been a friend, so do you know anything about how well she cohabits with people? 

I would suggest talking to her parents about what her plans are, and what she plans to do for rent and bills.  Because unless you are ok getting her part of the bills indefinitely, I would try to have her at least have a plan, finding a job can be next to impossible at times.  

Will her parents cover her bills if she doesn’t? If so get that in writing from them.  


I can understand how you might be concerned about your drinking triggering her, and thus y’all getting into a downward spiral together.... 

I admit to not know too much about addiction of this nature, but I would imagine it might be hard and triggering to see you drink when she can not...  but such is life and you always have to make efforts to avoid negative things, is having her in the house with it fair for her recovery and treatment? 


Granted that isn’t your fault, but it’s something to think about and maybe discuss first.  


All her issues and red flags to you aside, maybe you having bpd could be helpful? I don’t know anyone irl with bpd, and sometimes I wish I did... I just don’t think people understand what it’s like to exist in this state... and being able to have someone on call who can identify how I identify (or closer then what I’m usually used to I guess), would be amazing.   

And maybe you guys can help support each other in ways others can not.     

You might run the risk of getting annoyed with each other and splitting, but maybe you can work out a system.   🤷‍♂️ 


Hindsight is always 20/20, but moving forward I don’t think there is a right or wrong answer.

BPD,er9mazb,t3_c0zdw0,1560625904.0,"I was forced out of punishment, often physical and all sorts of rejection to behave , feel, and react normally as a child, not that I wasn’t at fault to a extent at times...  but I had diagnosis from a early age like borderline and such... so it was already known I had issues beyond my own control.  

Love and acceptance was a carrot constantly dangled as a treat i would never be able to achieve.  

Because of this I aged out of state care at 18, never in my whole childhood able to obtain the emotional balance demanded of me. 


When you grow up in the system you are ALWAYS wrong, and punishments can often turn physical.  

Being viewed as over dramatic all the time can quickly make one easily dismissible.  


I guess in the back of my head no matter what I do I’m always going to know I’m wrong.   


I just feel if I express my self in any way, it doesn’t matter because I don’t matter.     

Not that I can’t behave in a manner of confidence or have good ideas... 


But i struggle to not only bring myself to express them, but properly drive them home to whomever I am trying to do so with. 

And it’s interesting when people find out you have a mental health issue, they immediately treat you with anything but understanding, and will try anything but acceptance.    I remarkably find this to be the case at doctors offices more often then not.  


I feel life has a very , “how do you feel/think?”, “oh ok that’s great and all, but we need you to feel/think this way, and just forget about the other stuff, and don’t ever bring it up again please, ok thanks” 

And when you are just not wired that way, people want to dismiss you.   

I think the ptsd has a lot to do with expression, physical, emotional, or intellectual.  I often “flinch” or hold back, always expecting a negative reaction or consequences even if I’m doing something positive or loving even.  


This all has also caused me great trust issues, so opening up has always been a great issue my whole life.  


Interestingly enough, when I do try to express myself people care not usually wanting to hear anything beyond “ok”, to the “how are you” type questions. 


Which in turn makes me more internally apprehensive about expressing myself.

Not saying “that kinda ptsd doesn’t exist”, it’s just kinda saying “that the only commercialized and ‘understood/accepted’ ptsd” ...


Which as this attempts somewhat poorly to point out, all mental health is a joke or a trendy status people seem to adopt... which being someone who has no other reality beyond suffering from these thing and much more their whole life, understands how frustrating this can be.  

Most people either invalidate or gaslight... and the reality is for a lot of us, that even most professionals don’t want to touch us with a ten foot pole...  it’s depressing in of itself. 


Sometimes I’m not sure about this new social media thing where everyone makes it the “cute” illness, is it invalidating to dismiss these people? 

Are they reaching out for help the only way they know how, being shown through tv or media how “cute and quirky” people are “supposed” to be? 

it’s not recognized, the day in and day out struggle of intense pain and suffering, with nothing but roadblocks you can more often then you wish trace back to yourself, for no reason other then existing???   

And when you do try to be as honest and blunt about what and how you feel, or lack there of, or not even sure if you exist or anything or one is real... people just look at you stupid... then they tell you how they felt the same way once, but they got over it, or similar shit.  


Maybe the only way they have found people take them even slightly serious is to embrace the stereotype. 



Or are they just exploiting for attention?


It’s hard to know when you are calling bullshit, or just being the same invalidation to someone that you yourself receive.    It’s a perplexing thing for me personally.  


I know that I’ve read a few articles about how mental health issues are on the rise.... 

And even with all the validation and eerie similar experience and pain sharing that I’ve only found on Reddit, I still feel all alone on my island of pain, like no one else could ever understand how BAD I feel.
