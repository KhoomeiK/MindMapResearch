Our minds can conjure up the worst and push us from the ones we love that support us, without your even realizing it‚Äôs happening. I just broke down and told them- you‚Äôre there, I know, but my loneliness is hitting me hard. Everyone of them asked how they could help. I suggest trying the same. See how it goes. But you‚Äôre never alone, definitely not here. Hang in there ‚ô•Ô∏è"

I‚Äôm mid mini crisis as well, feeling the same. I‚Äôve been journaling things to be grateful for, things that make me different/special, and the people who have done things that have impacted me for a lifetime- in a good way, even if not recently. I know it sounds silly, everyone says journal, journal, journal- but it‚Äôs a tool to refer to every time I feel this way. 

May I ask what you‚Äôre struggling from, and what help you‚Äôre looking for?"

Mental_Help,fita1mn,t3_f9mdg5,1582711496.0,"I hate to tell you this, but sometimes in life you realize that those we surround ourselves with intentionally or unintentionally cause us pain. My brother and I, at 31 years old, still fight almost every time we talk. MOST of the time he‚Äôs right, but in the moment it‚Äôs hard to realize that. However, in moments of weakness he‚Äôs admitted that being a source of support for me- is actually what helps him to keep pushing through his own bouts of depression and painful personal growth. You may not realize it, but even at your weakest, you‚Äôre making a difference in someone‚Äôs life. It‚Äôs tough to look at it like that, but be proud of who you are- a BADASS bisexual with a keen sense of social awareness and a fight to survive (hence your taking the time to post this) So don‚Äôt give up! You got this. I have been taking all the bumps and hurdles I‚Äôve encountered recently (seemingly at every turn) and looking at them like a quest in a game- once conquered, I‚Äôm moving right along to the next. Sounds cheesy, but it‚Äôs working for me. Lastly, EVERYONE is socially awkward in middle school, some kids just learn how to cover it up a bit faster... and others are still in their 30‚Äôs+ taking communication classes and therapy for improving those lacking skills... so don‚Äôt beat yourself up. You have a long road of greatness ahead ‚ù§Ô∏è"

I‚Äôm an avid believer of women having the right to make any decision regarding their body- without any feeling of shame or guilt. 
I was never shamed or guilted for my decision. Luckily. I‚Äôd be livid as well. Please take a moment to realize you‚Äôre only trying to pick a fight. It‚Äôs not one you‚Äôll win, because you have a misconception of my intent and my beliefs. I kindly ask you to reconsider your judgment. We each have our own experiences, and now you‚Äôre actually shaming me for mine. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with you having experienced and felt what you had- and there is nothing wrong my experience or resulting feelings either. Thank you for supporting your beliefs, I‚Äôm right there behind you. Cheers to a common ground!"

bipolar,feitiqu,t3_epcs9l,1579146813.0,"Having lead what seemed like a normal life for 28 years, outside of minimal anxiety and depression (it didn‚Äôt feel minimal until now), and then feeling as though I watched my life dive off a cliff... I ask you to read. I saw a Psychiatrist for a year... a year of agony with (now I know) missed diagnoses and poor medication management for my bipolar, OCD, social anxiety and what I knew was mild agoraphobia and ADD. I knew this because I studied up on my symptoms- heavily, then the medication research... to finally when we moved researching the hell out of the ‚Äúright‚Äù doctor... and it paid off. Sometimes the research and fitting second opinion is worth the struggle that we all know is there. Hang in there, and know from my Psychiatrists own words ‚ÄúThe best therapists, better yet, the best people, are those who have struggled- and those who have struggled hard.‚Äù So believe in yourself. Learn about your interests and then your capabilities.
I went from managing a recruitment department for a government contractor to deciding to make crafts to sell on Etsy, and also learning the Amazon FBA program ropes and embracing the fact that I have to work to pay for student loans I obtained for a degree that was for multiple professions I‚Äôll struggle to ever pursue... but it fuels me not to give up. Find out where your symptoms lie on a severity scale. Find the right doctor for you- read up on them. Then once you‚Äôre on the right medications- follow your heart. It‚Äôs creative, I just know it. 
Always there <3"

She‚Äôs taking me off gabapentin and highly suggested others to try. She also spoke poorly of seroquel as well. She defined it as one of the numbing medications that she refused to prescribe. Anyone‚Äôs input on all of her feedback would be great. However, I‚Äôd suggest a new med mgmt spot. that does seem like a lot. Let me know how it goes! You‚Äôre not alone :)"

bipolar,fb3t5m4,t3_ebazmr,1576487728.0,"Keep searching, your best chances are within the first few hours. Putting litter out has been found ineffective/mostly a myth. 

Lay scent trails- pieces of cloth, like a ripped up t-shirt with your scent on it (any other pets if you have them)

Sprinkle a trail of their favorite treats or cat food from wherever he scattered away towards, back to your home. 

Cats are scared at this point and screaming their name won‚Äôt help. Try calling soothingly just to see. It‚Äôs probably within a 5 house radius. Check under porches and sheds.

If you go more than a day or two- I can give some more tips that we received from the trackers we hired and paid $400+ when our cat escaped in August. 

Best if luck!!!"
