depression,focunmf,t1_foapcs4,1587676122.0,"Thanks for sharing! I worked part-time in an amusement park for few months while waiting for a job fit my degree. I finally got it and now I am miserable. I just want to do a simple job, without any stress like that part-time job. Your sharing would be an encouragement for myself! Thanks a lot!"
depression,foctxel,t1_foanvrz,1587675824.0,"Same here! I don't care at all abt my job, even the tasks aren't hard i feel exhausted to just finish them. I wanna quit but I cannot. Every morning meetings with people at work is almost as a nightmare for me. I was good for a while till I got my first job. I was struggling to fit into the new environment. Worrying abt what people at my workplace think abt me, how I perform my tasks drained all my energy. Now with the hit of Covid virus, things are getting worse."
