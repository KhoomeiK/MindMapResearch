2) Beans and nuts make me more reliant on slavery? Do you know that it takes many times more calories of plant food to raise animals for slaughter, and that some of that gets outsourced to poorer countries who grow soybeans and corn for the animal feed for richer nations than for their own people?
3) My mental illness has nothing to do with veganism. How fucking dare you. Besides, do you talk like this to the countless meat eaters who are dying of diet related heart disease or diabetes? I'm flabbergasted that you disregard the tons of evidence that eating meat and dairy are bad for you, then you take my one incidence of having trauma caused schizophrenia as an excuse not to be vegan. I'm speechless.
4) I get my blood drawn twice a year. They do a full blood panel and last time my doctor said my levels were ""great"". Physically, they always remark on what great health I'm in even if my mental health is not so great.
5) You are right that its impossible to be a ""pure"" vegan in the way you describe, but no vegans except newbies or the foolish would say that they cause zero harm in the world. We strive for as little harm as possible, and its entirely reasonable to exclude all animal products from our diets."
vegan,fbetk54,t1_fbd8cja,1576793606.0,"1. Buying food on amazon is generally more expensive. If you can't find vital wheat gluten anywhere around you (wondering if you've even looked), then do without. There's tons of other foods you can eat instead. You aren't going to die if you don't eat a rotisserie chicken. That shit isn't good for you anyway. I was just illustrating a point that I could make exactly what you eat for cheaper. I live in california so food is generally more expensive here on average anyway and I make do.
2. Where do you live where you have no mexican grocery stores, or a mexican food section in the supermarket? And no it does not necessarily require additional prep. You have to cook ground meat to a safe temperature before you can eat it which you dont with tvp, it only has to be hydrated. And you're going to put spices on your taco meat anyway so how is that more prep? You sound lazy as fuck tbh. It's like pulling teeth with you.
3. Milk is a shit source of calcium that actually can promote osteoporosis rather than prevent it. The countries with the highest milk consumption actually have some of the highest osteoporosis rates. You do not need dairy to survive. It is only considered a food group because of the dairy lobby aggressively pushing it as necessary. Adult humans do not need to be sucking on cow tits. You can get calcium in other foods. 
4. Cheese is not a good ingredient. Cheese is terrible for you. Put nutritional yeast on it instead, or learn how to make a quick garlic sauce to drizzle on. If you can afford to spend money on pizza, you can afford soymilk and nutritional yeast.

It is not a lot of time, or energy. For fucks sake I have schizophrenia and major depressive disorder and I can still make it work. The problem is you can't be inconvenienced in the slightest bit. If someone told me I could save a life just by slightly altering my diet, I'd do it in a heartbeat. That's what veganism is. But you just whine about having to figure a few new things out or maybe check out a local grocer you havent looked into before for ingredients you need.

Animal products meaning anything from an animal or produced by an animal. Vegans eschew meat, eggs, milk, leather, fur, animal tested products, and we don't do things like ride horses or purchase animals (adoption is okay). Veganism is an ethic of nonviolence where we try as much as possible to reduce the harm we cause to other life. It's impossible to not cause harm at all, so anyone suggesting veganism is about purity is mistaken. It's about respecting others and their desire to be free and live on their own terms.

Vegetarians only stay away from meat, but as the animal products they consume still contribute to animal death and suffering, it's at best a stepping stone towards veganism, and should not be considered an end in and of itself unless there are factors in the individuals life that render it impossible to go fully vegan."

When you say you can't afford good vegan things, I'm assuming you mean your diet is primarily composed of prepared meals like chicken tenders or mac and cheese or whatever. In that case, yes, the vegan versions of those things are currently more expensive than the animal based counterparts due to subsidies and other factors. But basic ingredients that can be turned into something delicious are often extremely cheap. I can make 5lbs of homemade seitan (vegan 'wheat meat') with a couple bucks of ingredients, most of which you can find anywhere, and one ingredient which is becoming progressively easier to find (vital wheat gluten). I can find that easy in my town but it might be harder for you (amazon might sell it in bulk). It takes hardly any time to prep it, and I have 'meat' for a couple weeks. But meat replacements aren't even necessary to make good food. You could make beans and rice which are as cheap as it gets and if you knew how to cook them properly and had good spices, it would be delicious."

Jesus..."

vegan,fa8i1dp,t1_fa8h60e,1575846710.0,"You could try asking for a lettuce wrap instead of a bun. I've had burgers this way and I actually quite like it. They'll usually give a few whole iceberg lettuce leaves to wrap around it. I find that a bun dulls the flavor somewhat while chewing, whereas lettuce doesn't. I still love eating carbs so I usually do a bun, but if I didn't have that carb addict in my head, a lettuce wrap is great."
VeganChill,fa8hlmu,t1_fa8d58g,1575846424.0,"There literally isn't any vegan medicine under your own definition because every medicine currently known to us has been tested on animals. Even the ""natural"" ones like willow bark have been tested extensively. Should we throw away the entire body of human knowledge concerning medicine because it was all once tested on animals? That's ridiculous."

Some people are just stupid and it doesn't mean I lack empathy to acknowledge the obvious. We can have empathy for someone who died playing chicken with a train, but it doesn't take away from the fact that they were objectively stupid."

As a child I lived in a hoarder house and didn't receive the kind of care that my peers did. I didn't need school to tell me what I could see with my own two eyes. These girls who fuck up their lives then brag about it are pathetic followers who are desperate for attention but don't have the character or intelligence to come up with something better than getting knocked up. There are many other women like me who realize this, despite our class or education level."

VeganChill,fa842ze,t1_fa7uv8n,1575840924.0,"The person you're responding to is also an animal who will suffer terribly if not for those meds. Veganism is about not harming animals unless absolutely necessary, and here it seems necessary. In a scenario of necessity, I see it as no different than having to feed domesticated cats meat because otherwise they will suffer and die of malnutrition. Besides there are few things that have not been tested on animals at some point. Pomegranates have been tested on animals. Should humans never eat a pomegranate ever again because a company once paid for a test involving them?"

Sometimes a band is used to cut off the blood supply until the tail falls off but it's still painful. They need some intervention, but we could at least give them painkillers for the procedure, but of course that eats into precious profits. Fuck the wool industry."

I think it's kind of rude to serve something you aren't even planning to eat yourself."
