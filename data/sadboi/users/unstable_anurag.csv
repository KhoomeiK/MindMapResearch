depression,f6hi85z,t3_dlfw2v,1572849540.0,"I feel the same way.. i have searched for many ways to kill myself the only fear i have is if i try any of these and didn't die. What if i get stuck in my body not able to move.. that's what stops me from freeing myself from my life.. 
Sometimes the thoughts get soo worse that i just cry and cry then suddenly I get blank no thought no emotion blast nothing"
