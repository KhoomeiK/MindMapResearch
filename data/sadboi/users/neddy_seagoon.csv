""To wed"" is a verb, but it's not used very much anymore other than as the noun ""wedding"". Instead we use the verb form of marriage, ""to marry"", either as an action one partner can do to the other ""Will you marry me?"", or as an action one person can do to the couple ""The pastor married them.""

One person or both people can say they ""were married"" or ""were married on [date]."" but this sounds a bit more formal (because with that phrasing it's implied that someone else performed the ceremony, putting an emphasis on that ceremony). If you want to be less formal, ""we *got* married"" is very common, as are other forms (""Wanna get married?"", we're getting married"", etc). ""We got married by [officiant]"" sounds incorrect/excessively informal to me, though.

>How do I tell who's good for me when everything is so fast-paced?

>I'm also a very open person, which I'm afraid might scare some people off.

I think I saw your post last week on sharing a lot very soon in a relationship, and based on what you say here, I see what you mean. I'm actually very open too and trying to figure that out. I think it's related to also being very trusting: I have a hard time remembering that some people might use that info to be bad to me. I wonder if some people get scared by that kind if ""throwing caution to the wind."" It's hard for a lot of people to be vulnerable. (Brenee Brown has some good books on this)

When we get depressed/have low self-esteem, we often take small facts and make them universal. Having a bad day? I'll never have a good day again. Did you possibly, maybe make a mis-step in a relationship? Well that *clearly* means you'll never find love **/s** .

If you can, try to pause and be more specific with what actually happened.

I was unemployed for a long time and it felt a lot like this quarantine.

The days where I felt the best were the days when I set *small* goals that I wrote down in a list and checked off when I got them done. It's harder to tell the lie that ""I did nothing today and I suck"" when you have text proof that you did do things. Write down everything. I'm putting ""answered this comment"" on mine for today.

Remember to count taking care of yourself (eating, getting dressed, going outside, showering, whatever you need) as a tasks on that list. They're important things to do, and if all you can get done is keeping going, that's okay.

Also remember that not eating, not sleeping, and not making time to think can all make depression and anxiety worse. I find that I sleep best when I:

* Don't use a screen/bright light for 30 minutes before sleeping
* only use the bed for sleeping/intimate time, not just lounging during the day
* take some time to think/meditate/pray during the day so that bed doesn't become ""that place where I start thinking about everything that happened today""

For eating, maybe try to set a schedule for when you'll eat, and make yourself eat then. I don't know if you have baggage around food, so take care of yourself, but I find that if I wait until I'm hungry to eat, it's too late and I'm over-hungry/panicky. Definitely be flexible with that schedule. If you feel hungry, have a snack, ideally something satisfying rather than chips, etc.

* As a poll, how many men are looking for a partner who is a good fit, and how many men are just out for sex and willing to do whatever to get to that end?
* How do other women discern between guys who just want sex and guys who are actually interested in them as people?

EnglishLearning,fqvenew,t1_fquuvyl,1589675656.0,"I agree with the other respondent, but am going to write my version in case it helps someone else.

In modern English and very few other languages, ""do"" not only serves as a verb, but also as a ""syntactic marker"" that marks the main verbs as: 

* a question (""Do you go there?"" is current, while ""Go you there?"" sounds like the speaker is about 500 years old)
* a negation, either in the imperative (""Do not go!"") or the indicative (""I do not go there."")
* emphasized (""I do know that."")

""Do not worry"" is the current equivalent the archaic command ""Worry not"". Unless ""the dog"" refers to something that is a constant and ongoing source of worry for the person being commanded, the statement is probably ""Do not worry [right now].""

The response to that would be ""I worry not"" or ""I do not worry"", *but* both of those phrases are too vague. In modern English ""I worry not"" sounds awkward and archaic, while both phrases are more likely to be interpreted as habitual action than present, continuous action, which is usually what a command is encouraging or forbidding.

In modern English, the correct, present/continuous response to ""Do not worry [right now]"" would be ""I am not worrying"", which can be shortened to ""I'm not"".

That's why it's correct.

If ""the dog"" was something that was a constant source of anxiety to the extent that the person was being commanded ""Don't worry [as a habit]"", then the person would respond ""I do not worry"", which can be shortened to ""I don't.""

EnglishLearning,fquljm2,t3_gkxws7,1589660847.0,"This is my gut feeling as a native speaker from the midwest of the US, but who's read a fair bit:

In this context it's a euphemism/name for anything related to ""trying to encourage a romantic relationship"" or wooing. Could be as light as flirting, could be as intense as offers of marriage.

It's an older/more literary way of describing that concept (it sounds like it would have been popular in the 18th and 19th centuries).

I think you're unlikely to hear it used in a positive sense these days, since it's a euphemism and is probably being used as a polite (or overly polite) way of describing something unwanted or excessive. I'm going to *guess* that in Victorian literature it was used to refer to anything Romantic because it was *all* considered taboo, like so many things, during that time.

If you're hearing it used positively/neutrally as a description of someone's attempts to woo someone else, the person talking is probably trying to emulate the language of that time period and is probably very into literature.

You are a person, as worthy of help and care as any other. You do not deserve abuse of any kind.

I would communicate your situation clearly to your GF's parents, or the owners of whatever house you end up wanting to move to. 

If you're afraid of feeling like a freeloader:

* A lot of people like to give gifts, have guests, and help people. It feels nice. Be a good house-guest.
* Be actively working on a plan and communicate where you're at with your hosts. If you move toward emancipation, communicate timing and your plans for how you're going to live.
* Help out around the house. You're all quarantined together. Do dishes, help with yard-work, look after your GF's brother, etc.

EnglishLearning,fq10lmm,t3_ggdzkp,1589040140.0,"Your definitions of the verb are correct, but there's nuance.

""To subject to"" is ""to place under the influence of"" and is used metaphorically to mean the definitions you gave. 

It tends to have a forceful, authoritarian, negative implication that the thing being subjected is powerless and completely affected. Even if it's not negative/bad, it's still an intense way of describing the relationship.

The first example is saying that the sample, presumably of a chemical that someone wanted to boil or refine, was exposed to intense heat beyond its normal tolerance. There's an implication that the sample probably won't be the same afterward.

The second example uses this same intensity, but as a joke. The speaker is implying that their uncle's jokes are so bad that they are a transformative, controlling, oppressive force, and that it's maybe even a little cruel to expose someone to them, like imprisonment or radiation. They're using hyperbole or overly intense/serious language for the situation to be funny."

Are you okay with veggies in Chinese takeout or other kinds of takeout?

How are you cooking your veg when you try, and how did you parents cook it? Broccoli can be great, but not if you microwave it into a paste.

If you're not concerned about any health conditions, butter and salt make most things better. I also tend to under-cook most veggies a bit, since slightly crunchy is *usually* more pleasant than mush.

Maybe start dipping raw broccoli or bell peppers in ranch too, then dial back how much ranch you take with each bite. Maybe experiment with lighter dressings too. Home-made vinagrettes are great once you learn how to make them."

* Moving early looks bad on your resume
* Better pay
* Girlfriend supports the idea and is open to moving your direction
* You'd incur debt to your current employer by moving early

Love

* Family
* Better city
* Job should be easy to find
* Guaranteed time with your girlfriend

I think you should at least find a job at home *before* you move back. You don't want to be unemployed, hunting for a new but apparently lower-paying job, paying to move, and retroactively paying for the first move all at the same time. Maybe your savings are fantastic, but that sounds like a stressful welcome home.

I'm not saying don't move back, I'm saying have a plan and make sure you're going to land on your feet before you jump. Moving early because you got hired out of your old position looks better on your resume than a gap.

If your girlfriend happens to find a way to move your way before that works out, congrats to you both!

My only concern about waiting is that you said that you're afraid of losing your girlfriend, but then immediately said that she's supportive and open to moving your way. Why are you worried? Just anxiety/knowing bad things *can* happen sometimes, or something specific? (I may be overthinking this)."

EnglishLearning,fpxfbnv,t3_gg2r05,1588981595.0,"You can, but there are probably better phrases. Also, ""I was taken for a ride"" sounds melodramatic for a lie as simple as a yes or no answer.

It's more appropriate for times when someone has lied repeatedly and elaborately, when there's a ""journey"" you're been taken on, to fit the metaphor.

I also feel like the phrase is usually used sarcastically/derisively when talking about lies that were complicated but seen through before they achieved what they wanted (as opposed to describing a time when someone lied elaborately and actually tricked you and the story have a serious tone). 

It might be a diminutive way of describing the act of lying, similar to ""crocodile tears"" or a ""sob story""?
