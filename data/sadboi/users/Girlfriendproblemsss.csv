OCD,fpzbugo,t1_fpz9z16,1589016237.0,"What if he feels anxious to masturbate infront of me? Should I masturbate beside him as well? And we both solo finish ourselves. Im not sure how to go about that? ""I wanna see you masturbate, it turns me on"" I'm not sure how to bring that up without making him anxious"
OCD,fpzbhm8,t1_fpz9z16,1589016100.0,"Wow, thank you so much for your reply! I am definitely going to try that out! The times we did have sex he was completely anxious and didn't look like he was enjoying himself. It left me feeling dirty, as if I raped him? Its hard to explain. But yea, thank you, that could actually help him get more comfortable around me sexually"

BPD,fpuc9u2,t1_fpub5un,1588909435.0,"Thank you for your reply! May I ask what your dosage is on lamotrigine? I find for my bpd it only really helps with dissociation. It does nothing for impulse and clinginess/abandonment kind of stuff. Like I am either super clingy or distant towards my boyfriend. Once I am angry, I can't stop and I instantly break up. I noticed on my mood chart, that before I went on meds, I never broke up with him. So I had more self control. Which is actually the reason I made the post. I'm wondering if lamotrigine is making me worse during arguments. If I should be 3/10 angry, I end up being 1000/10 angry and I keep going. I just feel more unstable. On 50 mg were the best moods I had according to my mood chart app"
bipolar,fpubude,t1_fpub9ww,1588909154.0,"Thank you so much! I have noticed that my dissociation has gotten a lot better on lamotrigine, but the higher I go in dosing, my moods are more whack. Im gonna try slowing tapering and see if I get better or worse. If I get worse after a month going from 150mg to 100mg, then I'll know I jave to go back to my old dose. Thanks for the input"
