AskReddit,fkmi31a,t1_fkmhhjl,1584329578.0,"They are testing the legality of the ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù basically to test the waters for the next ‚Äúglobal emergency‚Äù. 

Not saying it doesn‚Äôt exist, but in the whole world as of **right now** there are 6000 deaths. Which is not a lot. In this country, it‚Äôs about 3000 confirmed cases. There are currently 327 million people in our country. The disease has a fatality rate of less than 3%. Measles has killed 10,000 people in California and nobody has mentioned that. 

Now, Trump has declared this a ‚Äúnational emergency‚Äù, meaning certain acts and laws can come in place because of this. But people are freaking out. And that‚Äôs what they want. Because the next ‚Äúemergency‚Äù will call for a global unity, under one government, which is mentioned in the Christian bible in the book of revelation. Which will ultimately be when the antichrist comes and ‚Äúsaves‚Äù the world. So I believe that‚Äôs the next step. Not for corona , I think it‚Äôs a dry run. But that‚Äôs what I believe. It‚Äôs to test the waters."
