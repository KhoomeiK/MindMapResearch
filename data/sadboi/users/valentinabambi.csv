I’ve always given the keys the morning/noon of the last day(so in your case yesterday morning — morning of March 31) that I’m supposed to be out OR before their business hours finish at the very latest so as not to avoid issues as technically you have until 11:59PM on March 31st but no one is there at that time and usually there isn’t a drop off box in the office where I could skip the keys in an envelope to give back if after hours. 

Just realized it’s now 4PM and so hopefully you were able to get this sorted and given to him before noon so as to not avoid further issues with him :)"
