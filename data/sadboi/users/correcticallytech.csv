In order to look at something, I have to turn my whole torso like 1989 Batman. This year I developed Sjögrens syndrome. I can’t make saliva or tears, it’s painful, but mostly just annoying. It also makes me very fatigued. I’ve worked hard since I was 16 years old (now 44). The two previous recessions screwed over my Jobs and I had to dip into my retirement fund. Now its happening again. I can keep working, but it’s so hard with these diseases. I’d just like to be able to slow down, pay my mortgage, and not have to work like a madman to make ends meet for the rest of my life.

Coronavirus,fnrcqeo,t3_g32elm,1587185124.0,"Everyone keeps saying stay home. I’m carrying on as ”normal“, here’s why:

1. I live in my own home by myself. My only friend refuses to go out because they are living with their grandmother. Therefore, I have nobody To socialize with in person.
2. Everybody at work is either working from home or was fired/furloughed. My work desk is in an isolated, empty room that’s about 25 yards long. I see absolutely nobody in an 8 hour day.
3. The only thing I am touching outside of my home is my car, the front door to work (with gloves and disinfectant every time), the work bathroom (again, with gloves and disinfectant every time, and washing my hands thoroughly). My work computer (which nobody else touches or comes into contact with), gas pumps (with gloves and disinfectant), and my mail (which I spray with disinfectant and leave in the sun). I have enough food for months, so I haven’t needed to go to the grocery store since early March.
4. I have nobody to rely on except for myself. If going into work helps me to provide for myself, and I am being vigilant about not putting others at risk, then there is nothing wrong with me going to work every day as I normally would. I was already living a very isolated lifestyle. With very little adjustments, I’ve been able to continue my normal routine.

Everyone‘s situation is different. I’m not going to put my livelihood at risk by not going into work when my normal routine is already extremely isolated. Yeah, I get it; If I was around other people a lot, or in a place where I was touching a bunch of shared surfaces, then it would make sense to stay at home. As it is, it would be foolish of me to put my job, my income, and my health insurance at risk. I’m lucky to still have a job and to be in good health. for me, staying at home would lead to far greater consequences than if I just continue with my routine."

Without a massive countrywide testing program in place, we’re all just fucking around on the deck of the Titanic at this point."
worldnews,fnkjhkv,t1_fnev3hr,1587029408.0,"Society was screwed when this virus started To spread. It was unavoidable... like an asteroid. Mitigation efforts are going to cause 1000 times the problems that the virus alone would create. This is basically like having 9/11 and the great recession happen every few days. Nobody considered the reality of social distancing and how bad people are at really avoiding germs. My local taco store has this ridiculous take out setup that looks like a recipe for infection. All of the takeout bags for uber piled up next to the front door (with the receipts inside the bags). Every person who enters the store thinks to look in each bag for their order, only to realize that the regular takeout orders are on the other side of the store. So you have every random person touching every single outgoing order. Stupid illogical directions on grocery store floors. By funneling people down isles in grocery stores, you’re just increasing exposure. Instead of quickly getting the one item I need and leaving, I have to walk down one isle and up another.  We’ll be living in a strange post apocalyptic world in two years. The looming danger is going to be the usual series of disasters. Wildfires and hurricanes are going to cause total chaos. If utilities go down in the next 24 months, it’s going to be like a holocaust."
