I don't really wanna talk with you anymore"". There's this person who used to be my teacher for 4 years up until 2014. And she became a very important adult to me. And has stayed in my life since then. I felt like she was the only one who understood me. I could tell her anything. And she helped me communicate when I couldn't by myself, she helped me calm down when I was having panic attacks, she helped me every time I moved to a new family. And I wrote to her a lot, about how I was feeling, because she was the only one who really understood and listened.   
But by 2019 we had grown apart a lot, and I didn't really confide in her like I used to anymore. Because I had tried so hard to confide in the people I had around me all the time. But she was still very important to me. But in fall 2019 I wrote to her, about how I was feeling. But this time she was very rude, didn't listen to me at all, and said some things that hurt me. And I understand that she might've had a bad day. But she's never been like that before. And since then she's been stating things that are just not true, saying things about my past/present problems that are really fucking weird. Like she will always have a special place in my heart for the help she gave me when I was younger. But man, wtf happened to you."

The thing about your meds is that it might be helping your anxiety. And quitting them can make depression and anxiety a lot worse. *Especially* if you quit cold turkey. I would really recommend consulting your doctor or psychiatrist again about slowly lowering your dose until you quit completely if that is really what you want to do. I wouldn't recommend doing what I did and lowering it yourself just because, well, it's never a good idea to change your meds if you don't know about the possible consequences. But if you're gonna do it anyways, just please don't quit cold turkey. It can really mess you up physically and mentally even though you haven't noticed anything yet!"
