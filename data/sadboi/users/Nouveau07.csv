You guys would need to file separately for taxes though so it doesnt combine your income in to her debt. If she has kids and work a part time job somewhere I'm sure they can take 10 percent of that.

There also may be some programs aside from military school that work with kids with severe behavioral difficulties. However, not sure how effective they are so I would do research.

I would help as much as u can that will not exhaust your emotional energy or resources. At the end of the day it is their son and decision. It could be beneficial though, if possible, to have their daughter live with another relative until they figure out what they do with him."

 This happened to me. I was with someone who I loved the idea of or potential to be more than the reality of the person. Took me 3.5 years to realize it though. I broke up with him three times. Third try I just jumped ship shortly after, not recommended though. Every time you Romanticize the relationship, counter the thought with times she made you very frustrated or made you feel small.

When I used to play in person it was pretty casual and with older 20s and 30 year olds so atmosphere was pretty chill. Not to say I have not experience a few in that age range have complete meltdowns or just bad sportsmanship  I've said good luck in the rest of their games and no one got salty. I was also usually the only one playing that was female and was relatively novice so maybe that's why?

It really isn't your fault if they are too immature to handle losing. However, I am well aware from what people have mentioned to me about their social habits that playing in person is one of the few ways they socialize. I try to keep that in mind if they get salty as it may mean they take magic very seriously."
