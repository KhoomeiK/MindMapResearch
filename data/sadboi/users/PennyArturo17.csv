TooAfraidToAsk,fr58rpb,t3_gmji9d,1589904484.0,"Hm  I was born with a birth defect myself... I‚Äôm kind of surprised to see how in the minority I am here for my opinion, although I understand where everyone else is coming from... Although I suffer chronic health problems daily I still find my life very worth living. If you have a genetic disorder like this lady does but you also find your life has value, then you might conclude that a child like you would have a valuable life too. For her to feel like having a baby like her is selfish would be for her to say that she‚Äôd rather not be alive than to have this defect. Some people end up feeling that way which is totally valid, but lots of us still have so many happy moments, valuable relationships, joy amongst the medical suffering. And no one escapes this life without suffering anyway, it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a version of having a child who will never face hardship in some form."

ptsd,fqjzat0,t3_gj911p,1589417470.0,"My advice would be to clearly communicate what you‚Äôve said here to her and ask her. Explain that you are taking her concerns seriously. Explain how you are addressing those concerns now and will continue to do so. And ask what she would need to see from you to feel comfortable trying again. Would it be a certain amount of time? Would it be some other milestone or action taken by you? See what she says and go from there. For me, managing PTSD has been a long journey, so it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs some set time that you will be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù, but if she wants to see you actively working on addressing it, that‚Äôs fair in my eyes. However, If she thinks that you need to be ‚Äúcured‚Äù in order to start again, that may mean (in my opinion) she does not understand the nature of how this condition can often go. In that case, perhaps your therapist could have a session with the both of you to explain it so she can make a more informed decision. Above all, remember that you are worthy of love and a healthy relationship. Perhaps your mental state was in a place before where it was hard for you to be in a healthy relationship, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt have one in the future while also still having PTSD."

My therapist just converted to phone call sessions because of the virus, perhaps you can see if that's an option? I find that some things are just easier to discuss with your therapist rather than your significant other, no matter how much you love and trust your SO. It's a better environment to work things out when you don't have to worry about hurting the feelings of the person in whom you are confiding.  

I'm no therapist, but if you feel comfortable perhaps you could ask your husband to spoon/cuddle you after those nightmares without sharing the details with him? It may help to re-establish the reality of your husband's relationship with you and avoid your worry of hurting his feelings. However, if this would be too stressful on you after those realistic nightmares, then of course that might not be a good idea. 

Best of luck to you <3"

One big reason being MURDER: 

‚ÄúIn the United States, more than 3 women per day are murdered by their husbands or partners.‚Äù And: ‚ÄúThe most lethal time in an abusive relationship is after a victim leaves. More than 70% of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has gotten out.‚Äù

Plus, fear the abuser will murder the victim‚Äôs loved ones such as children:

I was born with a birth defect, and yes as people are pointing out, it can suck. Big time. Would I want my parents to have stopped it if possible prior to birth? Yes. So I get why everyone feels so strongly about inflicting this on a new generation. But let‚Äôs look at the one, possibly two, people already about to suffer from this. You‚Äôre saying he just found out his dad may be dying this slow death and he may also be at risk of dying this slow death. Like this comment points out‚Äî he‚Äôs probably terrified. He is at the front end of a long grief path to acceptance. This is a lot for him to process. You‚Äôre  responding by saying you gotta leave him. That‚Äôs valid, but also probably very painful in his time of grief to hear. You‚Äôre also insinuating that his dad was an asshole for having him because he had a risk of it. You‚Äôre also saying you feel lied to (I get that) but did he ever say ‚ÄúI have no possible defects to pass to future generations‚Äù? I doubt it. I think ‚Äúlied to‚Äù is probably a bit harsh, unless there was direct question and confirmation beforehand. Perhaps his feelings on the IVF thing would change after some of this initial pain and shock die down. Your concerns are valid but.... he is suffering and to me, insinuating he is an asshole for his emotions about it right now is harsh."
