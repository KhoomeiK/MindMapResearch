I'm getting pissed with not so much the grind but the bullshit rockstar throws in our way like the infinite spawning enemy AI and slow as fuck garbage boat/post op van missions that just slow progress down for no reason other than they can and i just wanna have more than enough cash to have fun.

Fallout,fp46094,t1_fp438u3,1588292380.0,"Yeah i was talking about FO4 specifically, the worldbuilding and general lore is utter dogshit in that game. It missed the mark on so many levels when it came to memorable places and i was real fucking disappointed especially in the vaults. I like reading terminals and shit about all the fucked up experiments that happened in vaults from Fallout 3 & NV like with the white noise and spore vaults and i was wondering if 76 despite all its massive flaws at least had something akin to those since FO4 felt so lackluster in that regard. Mostly everywhere you went had nothing but raiders ghouls and mutants to shoot at and nothing really stood out or had any sort of decent backstory behind them aside from a few places like the glowing sea"
