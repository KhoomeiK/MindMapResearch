SandersForPresident,fgzrbcr,t3_f0ubtj,1581196827.0,"Downvotingon the basis that we are not sounding the alarms loud enough. A reputable poll released today shows us BEHIND Pete. This is not a drill, we need to be going ALL OUT. Don't let this poll make it seem like NH is in the bag. In fact, I think it is going to be extremely close, which worries me. If Pete wins NH our movement will be hit with a gut punch."
SandersForPresident,fggbqsv,t1_fgg3rrf,1580758502.0,"No this is incorrect, he is not lying in this instance. I am a student at UPenn and was actually enrolled in the Wharton School during my freshman year until I transferred fulltime into the Nursing School. Anyone who graduates from undergrad in Wharton says they graduated from Wharton and you receive a BS (not a BA). The degree says, Wharton.Likewise, as a nursing student, I am graduating from the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing."
SandersForPresident,fgeocki,t3_ey032q,1580704727.0,I am always very confused about these. I thought the max an individual could give was $2700?

SandersForPresident,fd4zhmu,t3_ek2m4c,1578172722.0,Straight fire. Very similar to this article I saw on here earlier: [https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/millennials-support-socialism-because-they-want-make-america-great-everyone-ncna1109191](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/millennials-support-socialism-because-they-want-make-america-great-everyone-ncna1109191)

mentalhealth,fbewkf8,t1_fbevmln,1576795652.0,That's not what the article says. It says he's the only one fighting for UNIVERSAL m4a style mental health care
mentalhealth,fbevfxy,t3_ecvlxa,1576794885.0,"Keyword: ""UNIVERSAL"" Pete Buttigieg does NOT support universal health care. He supports a single payer opt in program that would bankrupt the government by making all the sick people who can't afford care go into the gov program."

SandersForPresident,f83kzp6,t3_dyumzv,1574214370.0,"I hope we see a more relaxed and personable Bernie, the guy we've seen on the campaign trail recently. He needs to blow it out of the water at this debate and he won't do it by saying the same stump speech. This is the 5th debate this season and his like 10th dem debate. He needs to show another side of him and tear down how the media falsley depicts hs personality."
SandersForPresident,f82uc2c,t3_dyjcfg,1574198372.0,"I am a monthly $2.70 donor, but sent in an extra $20 today as a pre-debate gift! Go get 'em Bernie."
