CPTSD,fmytv8y,t3_fy33z7,1586495604.0,"You’re not the only one. I’m still in school and the teachers are assigning homework online, but the thing is I cannot get anything done whatsoever. The sudden and constant lack of routine is awful for me, and the teachers have apparently decided that since we have more free time we can have more work. But no teacher is accounting for all the other teachers. 
I’ve been getting so anxious at times that I get nauseous lately, and I have a paper that’s almost a week late I need to finish but I am just heavily procrastinating, so much. I feel so incredibly guilty about actively it but only because I dread the consequences I know are coming. 
Everything now is too heavy for me and it hurts to see other people in my home not have the same problem. I don’t understand why so many people are in a rush to go back to their “normal” when it is so stressful and fast-paced (at least in my experience). I wish we could all afford to take the time to calm down and step away from the world for a month or two. God knows most of the global population needs it!"
mentalillness,flltidn,t3_fp4qih,1585267423.0,"i always wondered why i felt awful with no clear reason behind it when i had almost everything i needed as a kid. you might want to look into emotional neglect and see if that fills in any gaps, and if it doesn’t, your struggle is valid regardless of a cause or not. i’m here if you have anything else to share. xoxo"
curlyhair,fl4g2p1,t3_fmdrcl,1584812781.0,Your eyeliner is gorgeous!! Would it be too forward of me to assume that’s the one from Glossier? It suits you so well ;4;
curlyhair,fg5jm5u,t1_ffvi6gj,1580529256.0,Thank you both for the advice and well wishes. I went with the chin-length cut and long layers which are much less of a hassle to deal with. Trying to make my previous hair length look decent took up so much of the little energy I had in the mornings. I’ll admit with it being so thick that it’s never been this short before but the cut was an unexpected relief. It’s not much but this means a lot to me. Thank you again
dating_advice,f8nwf3i,t1_f8nvhui,1574654725.0,"Lol, no. I just prefer not to reveal my specific age (which I know is typically the old-fashioned boomer way of telling kids to navigate the internet) but I’m comfortable with just stating that I’m in my teens. If the lack of a specific number is really an issue, I don’t have a problem with deleting the post myself. 🤷🏻‍♀️"

AskReddit,f494vqk,t3_djych6,1571456927.0,"Listening to my younger brother (who’s on the spectrum) when he’s stimming. I like to call the sounds he makes his “happy noises,” because he usually only makes them when he’s in a good/content mood. They sound like humming but without a tune— sort of if you went “hm” or “mhm” at something, but stretched out over a period several seconds. Until he was about 6yo, he was nonverbal from birth, and we thought he would stay that way. Now, he is very loud and very unafraid to tell you what he thinks, lol. He still prefers not to talk often, but he does when he thinks it’s absolutely necessary to communicate. No matter what mood I’m in, good or bad, if I listen for his “happy noises” and hear him, I usually end up smiling just because it tells me he’s in a good mood."
MakeupAddiction,f4945uj,t1_f48s2lt,1571456455.0,"Thank you for the recommendation! I’ve heard a lot about that one actually, but I was a bit skeptical about the shade range and ordering online. I typically don’t like the hassle of returning products, in person or online if it was too dark for me. I’ll definitely look into that (and maybe also a spray)."
MakeupAddiction,f493wwk,t1_f48t6mc,1571456291.0,I might try that actually! I didn’t realize that you could layer the futuredew other skin products until I reread the Glossier description earlier. Thank you for the advice :0
dragonage,f48l41r,t3_djrid6,1571441764.0,"I headcanon really, really hard that Mythal isn’t actually (or at least completely) dead, and will be some form of antagonist in DA4. Pretty sure she’s the only character who’s been in each game so far, and we have no idea what her agenda is/was in past games. I can’t think of her as the sort to just mess around with history for over thousands of years just for laughs/benefits. 

I also thought it was a little ridiculous for Flemeth, her vessel (I think of them as two separate beings in one body) to just get murdered as a way to demonstrate how drastic the egg’s plot-twist reveal was. And even if she and Solas were friends in their time/pre-Veil, she was an Evanuris herself, and she represents justice/fairness, which doesn’t exactly correlate with mercy. Justice has the potential to be very cruel. 

Also, there’s no way they’d just kill Mythal off completely like that, when she has so much plot relevance! I mean, technically they could have, but that’s a stupid idea. So yeah, I think she’s probably sharing a body with Solas now instead of Flemeth, who’s dead, and he just has more control over his own body because I don’t think Flemeth was born a mage. 

Realistically, I’ll totally get proven wrong in DA4, but yeah, this makes much more sense to me."
dragonage,f48jlsa,t3_czp6b2,1571440605.0,"God, I want so much more LORE. So much lore. That’s what really, really irritated me about Trespasser/Inquisition’s cliffhanger ending/reveal—  we had a character who was secretly a GOLDMINE of worldbuilding/game lore, and there weren’t many opportunities to learn any of it from him. Not to mention with the whole reveal, we can’t be 100% that it’s all true. I do think the reveal was excellently and beautifully done, and I severely hope we get more elf/qunari culture/worldbuilding-lore and history. It just irritates me that we don’t have very much concrete info about the Evanuris/Forgotten Ones and how life was pre-Veil, lol. Not to mention how the Blight really came about, and the Void that’s mentioned in the  codexes in Mythal’s temple. Maybe the Blight = Void? I have no idea. I am excited because I heard somewhere that Weisshaupt has possibly revived the griffins from extinction, though. 

Also, a dwarf romance that isn’t half-assed— There was a sort of romance with Scout Harding, but it was mostly just flirting. I think there‘s a few lines about it from other characters if the only character you flirt with in-game is her, and you get more content with her in the Jaws of Hakkon DLC, but it’s just not the same. :/

TL;DR– I want answers to important questions in lore so I can get a sense of satisfaction from placing everything together like a jigsaw puzzle, griffins, and also more romances that aren’t human/elf race. It’s all about that height difference, man."
