Here's the deal. Everyone sees this coming...all you brain dead troglodytes think you are ingenious big brain market analysts because you're predicting a crash in the market. A lot of folks are investing in the future as well which will soften the crash. Not to mention, it won't be a switch off when quarantine ends. The game has stickiness. Play will slowly return to normal, much slower than life is returning to normal. You're not smart. You're not special. You can't time the market. If you do, you got lucky."
