relationship_advice,fr2wiws,t3_gm7ux4,1589845272.0,Did you explain why you don’t want them up? She might understand a bit better then. But she sounds like a brat I’m sorry. I think you and your husband are handling the situation well. And yes if people don’t respect your wishes with your child then they absolutely can’t see them. I do the same thing.
BPD,fr2iq0l,t1_fr1t3i3,1589837989.0,I love this response thank you. Yeah I work with babies and I try to bond with each of them and provide a space that’s safe and loving for them. It just sucks when I’m the only one that that they bond with cause then they only want me :( but yeah luckily I can get out of the classroom sometimes with them now that it’s warmer out.
relationship_advice,fqzkxgi,t3_glmfy6,1589769547.0,"Omg I feel this it was almost the same with me. I’m white and he is Mexican and his mom didn’t want him to date a white girl. Well years later, she kept telling him to buy a double wide trailer or that she would help him buy a house. I knew what that meant. If we got her help we would live with her. Hell no. I told my BF this is an absolute dealbreaker. We lived in her house for 3 months when I was pregnant and it was super awkward I hated it. My MIL is sort of manipulative in a way and makes me bf think it’s his idea. That she’s going to help him buy a house and then she will move in because the house will be nicer.

Just tell him that it’s a dealbreaker. I kept telling my bf if he really wants to go live with his mom then he can! But I’ll live somewhere else with our son. Of course we will still be in a relationship but just live separately. He doesn’t bring it up anymore."
ShaneDawson,fqy0419,t3_gl9k60,1589740462.0,I used to want it only cause I was a huge fan of his and supported him. I thought it looked good and now idk? If that makes sense.
relationship_advice,fqvyxdb,t3_gkpgjg,1589688407.0,"I have a mental illness (borderline personality disorder) and it sounds like either shiczo-affective disorder or bipolar. I’m not a doctor at all but some of the symptoms are similar to mine so I can relate to it. I honestly believe that she has no idea how her actions are affecting other people. From what it sounds like, she’s probably been mentally ill for awhile. 

When my mental illness gets bad I suffer from delusion I 100% to be true. I thought my bf was a monster & hates me, etc etc. He didn’t do anything to make me think that at all, and it took me 3 hours to see that. But I’ve also been going to therapy so I can snap out of it. I also isolate myself in a dark bedroom when I get overwhelmed. When someone didn’t appreciate something small I did for them in the past I would get really upset, because I feel everything at 100% all the time. I would think like wow they don’t even like me, they don’t love me, they’re probably annoyed of me. 

When I get really really depressed mood swing, it lasts maybe for 4 hours and it’s hard to pull me out of it. Because I literally cannot see anything good or how irrational it is, I’m just focused on how much it HURTS. Especially when I currently have the believe that my FP (favorite person) is mean to me and doesn’t love me. The book “I hate you don’t leave me”. Was really helpful for my relationship.

I’m so sorry you’re witnessing this OP. I feel like she’s in a lot of pain. I really think she needs inpatient professional help. I have in a sense been in her shoes before so I understand it. It’s amazing that you’re holding everyone together in such a difficult painful situation. You shouldn’t have to deal with that at 17. Make sure you have your support network of people to reach out to also. You need to be cared for too, since you’re always caring for everyone else. Message me if you want to talk."
BPD,fqv7w80,t1_fqv7mma,1589671666.0,"It was thru my therapy center that I already went to, but you could probably just google Saturday DBT groups near me maybe? If you’re looking for weekends."
Parenting,fquqtad,t3_gktv14,1589663170.0,"My dad was the same way except not with video games it was on the computer while he was working (he worked for Verizon) or just being in the computer room by himself on the computer either working or idk he was crabby we left him alone.

I (25,F) would go in there when I was younger and try to excitedly tell him about something and he would snap at me. I couldn’t ask him for anything while he was in there.

Eventually he was barely in the computer room but still worked random shitty hours and was a general dickhead. As a kid I couldn’t “be a kid” such as; have my room messy with toys when friends were over EVEN when the mf door was closed. Spilling anything, I would get yelled at. Being loud at all with friends. Having friends over and being loud... making any sort of mess. Pretty much anything lol. Eventually in my teen years I barely talked to him except “where’s mom?” When I got home and that’s about it. I was never home and when I was home I hid in my room. 

FINALLY years later I’m 25, and our relationship is better. I have a 2 year old and he absolutely adores him. I still limit being around him because I just know how he gets even tho he’s retired and no longer on a computer at all.

My point is that technology, stress, and depression changed my dads personality forever. He went to a therapist like twice and then refused to go after that. I just wanted to give you a little bit of perspective how it eventually affects the child. Oh I should also add Him and my mom are divorced and have been for awhile.

Message me if you need to talk. I’m sorry this is happening, it sucks not having any help from your partner who CAN help but won’t."

It’s killing our sex life I’m disgusted by him every morning. I wish he would just get it like okay you’re horny in the morning cool I realllllly don’t care. I don’t understand guys. I feel your pain so much lol. Let me know if you find a solution cause I’m miserable as well and I literally don’t want to be touched by him at all now."

I’ve been thru the same thing and view it as an addiction. Go no contact completely and if you absolutely need to communicate have your family do so. It’s very easy to be reeled back in when you’re trauma bonded with someone. You can do this!!! Remember it’s going to be hard but you need to love yourself and love your life. A good partner will support you regardless, and let you have your own life as well. Good luck to you girl I believe in you. ❤️"
relationship_advice,fqfgtxs,t3_gi5601,1589324633.0,"I’ve been dating my bf for 6 years. 4 years ago my ex boyfriend, K took his own life. I was destroyed. Even tho we had been broken up for awhile, there was a time where he was my best friend. We were close for a long time. It was your typical high school romance. Love letters, sweat shirt stealing, talking on the phone for hours, constantly talking to each other. We stayed close after we broke up, it wasn’t until I started dating my current bf that K and I drifted apart. Even tho it was a year or so after I think he had not moved on.

So in 2016 while living in another state with my current bf J I got news that K had taken his life. I couldn’t even afford to go fly back for the funeral. From there was a huge downward spiral that lasted for a long time. Rereading our old messages, watching old videos, etc. it wasn’t until I moved back home and got close to K’s sister when I truly started to heal. 

A couple months ago I got a tattoo on my right arm that says a K in cursive with angel wings over it, I corinthians 13:4-13 and the date he died under it. Thankfully my bf was supportive throughout the whole thing. He didn’t understand it but he didn’t judge either. He knew K as well, he wasn’t close with him but they were in the same grade.

Anyway, my point is is that grief is very difficult. The 5 stages of grief don’t go in order and often repeat thru cycles. The best thing you can do is talk to her about it, about him. He is no longer alive so it is no competition. They shared a strong bond and you haven’t been dating her that long. You’re not there yet with her but in time you could be. Just some perspective from someone that’s been there. Good luck."

When I was younger on Mother’s Day my dad would cook my mom her favorite breakfast, and I would bring the tray into the room so she would get breakfast in bed. Then we wouldn’t let her do much all day since she does a lot and deserved to relax. We would get a card, I would make her something, and my dad would get her something small that she actually needed like socks or something. She was basically treated like a princess lol. So to have that to essentially compare it to is really hard... I have to have zero expectations so I’m not disappointed. I hope your Mother’s Day got better."

I couldn’t depend on them and they would spread my personal info around our small ass hometown. It really hurts at first and it’s hard to distance yourself.

I’ve been in a somewhat similar situation and my self esteem was fucked. Have a deep talk with him and be very very clear with how you feel.

I didn’t need anyone to babysit because I spent all of my time with him lmao 😂 I felt really alone and the only person that made me feel better was my mom. I trusted her because she does exactly how I want and we parent the same way. She’s like an older version of me. Everyone else seemed like they didn’t give af and just wanted to hangout with a cute baby. A year ago I would have done the same thing and genuinely not see anything wrong with it.But like I said, my mental health was SHIT. I look back at that first year and cringe so hard...

He was pretty wholesome as far as anyone saw. When we were all 20, G was sexually assaulted by this guy while she was intoxicated and falling in and out of sleep. He was our best friend so she was really confused, and kind of blocked it out for awhile because it was so traumatic. She stopped drinking for a year and started to remember it. No one in our friend group believed her except me. I mean by that point our friend group were drifting apart, but still. It took me awhile to come to terms with it.

relationship_advice,fosrty9,t3_g93p6m,1588036740.0,What the hell... you’re fucked up.
HaircareScience,fosr243,t1_fosm8pu,1588036284.0,"No I’ve had ringworm before a couple times cause I work with kids and it isn’t that. I looked up Psoriasis and it’s not that either 😔

As of right now he has no boils/acne on his head. Like you can tell there used to be bumps by feeling the scalp but yeah for now they’re gone. He just wants answers and feels hopeless I feel so bad for him."
relationship_advice,foslawe,t1_foskhqh,1588032959.0,You’re welcome ❤️ I hope things turn out better for you now that you kind of have some answers
relationship_advice,fosc7ay,t1_fos6fyz,1588027866.0,Yes I completely agree
relationship_advice,fosc4z0,t3_g94o47,1588027830.0,Huuuuge red flag. Please run. You deserve better than this by far.
HaircareScience,fos9okz,t1_fos954t,1588026512.0,"Yeah his hair texture is reallllly dry. He finally started listening to me and I got him some argon oil hair masks, good conditioner, shampoo, leave in conditioner and Moroccan oil.

Yeah that’s what I was thinking. He did have bad acne on his face but at this point they’re giving him the Accutane for the spots on his head. He isn’t losing anymore hair but idk."
relationship_advice,foqq36o,t3_g8p00r,1587998749.0,Yeaaaaaah red flag
relationship_advice,foqpu6l,t3_g8lw1y,1587998615.0,"For me, I realized recently that I was asexual. Demisexual to be specific. That basically means I only feel sexual attraction to someone if there is an emotional connection. Even so,for me sex is like a light switch that is mostly off. That being said, when I feel very emotionally close to him I want to show my love for him by having sex. He never makes me feel bad for it, he’s accepted this is the way I am and knows how to work with me. Some days I have to have sex every other day, and then other days we’ll have sex once a week. He knows if he asks for it a lot or if he pressures me it pushes me away. It’s something that I had to come to terms with myself, I realized I wasn’t “damaged” (my term for me and how I had felt about myself) and there was a lot of people that were the same. Message me if you want to talk. I’ve been in your spot before and it was really hard for me. I felt lime I was broken. Also if you look over r/demisexuality it might give you more info."
relationship_advice,foqlfjb,t3_g8hskc,1587996120.0,"That’s super messed up. I don’t feel like that would be something you would be able to recover from. You should be with someone who loves you unconditionally and doesn’t treat you like that. For me, I’m honestly really disgusted by my past. I wasn’t a hoe at all but I dated these really douche bag guys. It makes me sick to my stomach thinking about it because they’re just not good people. Anyway, my point is I would never say this to my boyfriend. I absolutely adore him and I know this would really hurt his feelings and our relationship. You deserve better. Please don’t settle for someone who doesn’t appreciate you."
relationship_advice,fopbura,t3_g8lgby,1587957646.0,"If you say no multiple times, it hurts, you want it to stop, it was rape. I know when people think about rape they think some guy at a party or something. Relationship is a real thing that I have experienced as well and I didn’t realize that I was raped. I was like oh he’s probably just confused and made excuses. This is consistently happening and it will only get worse. You are already being physically and sexually abused. Please please get out while you can, get with someone safe. Make a safety plan. I am so sorry that you are going through this. I’m a survivor too."
relationship_advice,fop73nw,t3_g8dwzy,1587954550.0,"That’s insane i’m so sorry. She is for sure in the wrong, she’s having an emotional affair."
demisexuality,foo56oj,t3_g88g6v,1587932718.0,I’m a troll when someone would ask for nudes I have no many I can use 😂 eventually they would get so annoyed and give up
relationship_advice,fogzpfd,t1_fogjiiu,1587758848.0,Lol yup
ChildcareWorkers,fogw1wn,t3_g7eucp,1587757609.0,It depends on where you work. I would totally do that if I didn’t have to bleach the shit out of my hair and was daring enough. Some places don’t mind but check with your boss first.
EDAnonymous,fo7iza5,t1_fo7irva,1587579139.0,Oh that makes sense. I’m trying to eat some fruit and eat in the habit of eating healthier. I’m starting to feel really weak and sick which can’t happen because I work with small children and I’m also a mom. It’s hard. It was easier when I was a teenager and could just sit and watch shows about food all day.
EDAnonymous,fo7hx2c,t1_fo7hnfo,1587578623.0,I’ve been taking like Adderall and Bronkaid when I don’t have adderall and I’m just worried my body is going to shit because of what I eat. Not like weight wise but idk. I don’t know what to do.
ChildcareWorkers,fnwbe6l,t3_g48yir,1587315142.0,Yes we are essential. I live in mn but now we are required to wear face masks while we work to protect the children. And a huge difference in sanitization
relationship_advice,fnvrjre,t1_fnv4x1q,1587302845.0,I agree this is a good idea. OP needs to act fast or she will spin it in her favor
offmychest,fnua22g,t3_g3nwwn,1587257652.0,"Damn I am so sorry. I’m borderline as well and I am suuuuuch an asshole when I’m having my borderline rage. My SO is an angel for what he put up with.... I was extremely awful on multiple occasions but he knew it was my BPD. Not using that as excuse at all, I’m just saying. It’s under control better now. But that’s thanks to therapy and my meds. I would never stop my meds or I don’t know what I would do. It’s sort of like you enter a psychosis of some sort and you’re in a high speed car with your emotions driving it. It’s hard to see the truth when someone is like that. 

Maybe practice setting up boundaries with her and especially researching DBT online and familiarizing yourself with it as much as you possibly can. It will 100% help her. The skills have helped me so much and I’ve only learned about 20% of them. They’re in therapy but there’s also a huge book of it and different sections for areas we need to learn. 

There is this one skill called TIPP and I use the T is stands for temperature. Putting your face in really cold water, or putting ice on your face. It slows your heart rate and you’re able to move onto another skill. Also if she would get like that you could possibly get her to do the TIPP skills while giving her anxiety med if she has one. 

Sorry I’m just trying to be as helpful as I possibly can. I know how hard BPD affects relationships and how miserable it can be for both people. Also there’s BPD support groups for people who are with someone with BPD. I hoped I helped a little bit. Message me if you want to talk. Hang in there!!"
BPD,fnta50d,t1_fnsplk2,1587237580.0,"The only reason I haven’t hung out with her is cause my parents had moved in with me to help pay the bills, and then my SO moved back in. So it was a lot of people in a small townhome for awhile plus I went down to 20 hrs a week at my job cause of the quarantine. I tried to explain that but idk she was really abrasive 😔 it was really triggering so I deleted all social media apps. I don’t want to engage in self harm behaviors and I’m trying my very hardest not to."
relationship_advice,fnsehdc,t3_g3gh5k,1587219867.0,I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Maybe this  happened for a reason because he’s not the one you’re meant to be with. Really shitty and hurtful way for it to happen but that’s where growth happens. Growth comes from pain. Best of luck to you in your healing process it seems like you have already learned a lot.
EDanonymemes,fns7z7w,t3_g3dk68,1587215302.0,Omg I’ve never seen anything more true 😂😂
asexuality,fns3lf8,t3_g3lm9o,1587211559.0,Yes!! I love it
EdAnonymousAdults,fns2w6u,t1_fnqnno7,1587210912.0,Thank u ❤️
EdAnonymousAdults,fns2v4q,t1_fnqj1ie,1587210883.0,Yeah you’re right my ED kinda went on pause too. I didn’t even show until I was maybe 6-7 months. But after my son was born my ED came back with a vengeance
