This requiring no more then 5 mins of active game time (once a seed is planted, it will continue to grow while you're offline) so if you have work or things to do in the real world you should easily be able to maintain the bond with little to no effort while doing fun stuff when active.

* Hopelessness (Thats a normal thing, I feel it's associated with most depression)
* Insomnia or sleeping too much (I have insomnia but that doesn't really cause concern it's pretty common also who doesn't love sleep)
* Thoughts of suicide or death (I've had this for as long as I can remember but I feel it's more to trauma as a kid)
* Low self-esteem (In a world where looks mean everything this just seems sorta inevitable if you're not what is considered ""Hot"")
* Loss of appetite or overeating (fluctuates)
* Poor concentration (Ever since I was young so this just could have nothing to do with depression)
* Loss of interest in things that the person used to like (This happens a lot but it's pretty on and off)
* Low energy or agitation (Both, dunno why)
* Thoughts of worthlessness or guilt (Story of my life)

First she should have been more open from the start on what was wrong/bugging her rather then bottling it up and using it as fuel during a fight. You on the other hand also shouldn't have reacted how you did, she gave you a pretty valid reason (assuming this isn't just her way of letting you down easy) ""I took it as she doesnâ€™t really care for me because she wouldnâ€™t feel weird about dating if she was interested in me"" this could be true if this wasn't something serious, but it was LTR. Did you know anything about that relationship? If not you dunno why it would be hard for her to date someone else so easily or soon. You made an assumption based on your desires/thought rather then putting her thoughts and feelings into consideration. This is why she was upset about you blocking her. (which means she actually had some feelings for you if that is the case) I would honestly recommend unblocking her on everything... Apologize sincerely, regardlessthe outcome if you guys are cool or not but explain everything thoroughly, explain how you overreacted and didn't take her feelings into consideration but also at the same time make it clear (in a clam manner) that she also is to blame a bit for not being more vocal about what was wrong, what was pissing her off and so on.
