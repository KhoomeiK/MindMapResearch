BPD,ffi90oo,t3_etnm73,1579968192.0,"i recently just moved and don‚Äôt have any friends yet besides my boyfriend. i was at his apartment with his roommate and we were watching some murder documentary and she mentioned bpd alongside sociopaths, narcissists, and psychopaths. it definitely hurt to hear that, especially since i am very aware of my symptoms and how they hurt me and the people around me. i am fully aware that bpd has that kind of rep, but it‚Äôs like a slap in the face to actually hear it in real life conversation. the way i see/saw it, is i am someone living with bpd but i would never physically hurt another person due to my symptoms and i‚Äôm sure you wouldn‚Äôt either. we can use our personality‚Äôs, high functioning lives and experiences to show others that bpd is a spectrum like most mental health disorders, (people with depression murder all of the time) and hopefully end this stigma. maybe you‚Äôre not comfortable yet, i‚Äôm not totally there yet, but someday maybe spread some awareness and say ‚Äúyes i have bpd but i am a healthy person and partner and not all people with bpd seek to hurt others‚Äù. or maybe next time we hear something like that we can just chime in (i understand why you couldn‚Äôt say anything in the moment cus i didn‚Äôt either since i feel very anxious around my boyfriends friends) but just chime in and try to educate. say you have a friend with bpd who‚Äôs a really good person. i wish u the best of luck with your boyfriends friends and hopefully you all can have a good relationship!"

SeniorCats,feixf3v,t3_eosvix,1579149871.0,"she is very petite, but after only a few days home the vet said today she‚Äôs up to 6.1lbs! i feel as though she‚Äôs gaining because she‚Äôs not as anxious here. in the past she‚Äôs weighed 10lbs according to vet records. i‚Äôm trying to avoid her gaining quickly because her joints may not be able to keep up. she was ranked a 2.5 out of 9 for her body condition score since she also has very, very low muscle mass. 

all the shelter said was that the ‚Äúowner developed allergies‚Äù whatever that means. i really wish i could get in contact with her previous owners, to find out more about her past and to give them the peace of mind that she‚Äôs here getting spoiled by me. if they did love her, i can only imagine how devastating it must‚Äôve been to give her up for whatever reason. i want them to know that she‚Äôs in great hands. 

i think i will forever take in senior cats one by one and support them this way. i was kind of stalking the humane society website for several months before i was able to adopt and shockingly enough the seniors come and go quicker than expected- my girl spent a little over a month there before i got her-however, there are senior cats there that have been there since october and the kittens are in and out of the shelter in a week. i absolutely love your idea of a beautiful feline senior living sanctuary. there is a great need to take in these animals. i also think it would be great for people to know that they don‚Äôt need to feel shameful for giving away their seniors, it must be devastating, but i think if there were more resources besides a shelter that people can bring their seniors to confidently that would be fantastic. the idea of people just opening the back door and letting the cat wonder out into stray-dom is the same as putting it down.
