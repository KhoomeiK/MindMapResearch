Why does this have to change the fact you think her husband is a great choice for her and your initial excitement over their choice to get married?

From your post and your comments, I can tell that you are very hurt and the hurt is very fresh for you no matter how much time has passed.

I won't say whether it would be a shame for you to miss their large ceremony or not because ultimately you are an adult and can make your own decisions; they invited you, which usually means they want you there and it would mean something to them for you to attend.

I do hope you actually read and comprehend the advice given to you here; you aren't being called an AH for being hurt -- it's the way you are handling your pain that's uncalled for and the AH behavior. You come off as caring only about yourself and not about your daughter and her husband, which is unhelpful towards any mature solution to this situation.
