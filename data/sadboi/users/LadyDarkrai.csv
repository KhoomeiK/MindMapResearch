mentalhealth,fh8gwsn,t1_fh5o3lg,1581359482.0,"Thank you, yes it's kind of the same. I will have to be there from 8am to 4pm. Having breakfast and lunch together with the 19 other patients. There will also be occupational therapies like coloring, pottery etc but also group and single therapy with the psychiatrist, check ups at a doctor etc as far as I know.. I don't know exactly how everything works yet tho"

Needafriend,fff9bui,t3_et62ad,1579878909.0,I can relate. Since I can think every person I considered my best friend considered someone else as their best friend. I often was part of a three people group where the other two were each others best friends and I just was kind of third wheeling

depression,f7e6bcd,t1_f7e5k1y,1573648250.0,"People like us tend to think, feel and act irrational. If we go ""unnoticed"" for a day on a platform for/with other depressed people I doubt the first reaction would be ""hm k idc"" but a bit more dramatic and crashing due to our irrationality. I also deleted cries for help on this platform because nobody reacted to it after 12+ hours and it made me feel even worse and more lonely."
depression,f7e5bgr,t1_f7dtbm7,1573647124.0,"It's nowhere about ""oh no I didn't get any upvotes, I'm not famous now"" but more about ""hm, did anybody at all even read what I said and if yes was my idea so crap that nobody acknowledges it?"" Especially in this sub an upvote doesn't always mean ""i like"" but often simply means ""I listened to what you have to say"", ""you aren't going unnoticed"", ""thank you for your help/effort"" and especially in this sub we all know how important this little form of attention and recognition is."
Needafriend,f74vxhg,t1_f74scoc,1573408835.0,Thats doesn't sound all too bad. We learn from pain and sometimes it helps improving ourselves!
Needafriend,f74rw69,t3_dubwe9,1573407104.0,"This year I actually decided to improve my life again and start taking care of myself again. Lost almost half of the amount of weight I gained in the 2,5 years of depression before and finally got help and started going to a doctor and therapist ☺ if you want to chat, send a message! F24 from Germany 🙆🏻"
