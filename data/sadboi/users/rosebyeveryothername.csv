It will only get better from here on out!
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fj6alhj,t1_fj63bk6,1583064866.0,"Yes they had funerals for Kobe and Gigi at least not sure about the other family but they can identify you based off of isotopes and dna located in your bones and sometimes hair it‚Äôs fingerprints. They were located pretty immediately after the wreck and the recovery begins as soon as LE arrives. They pushed the date of the funeral back because Kobe‚Äôs family had wanted his funeral in a different way than his wife and children had wanted. There was a private and a public ceremony to honor the wishes of both Kobe and his family.  There‚Äôs millions of families that are forced to buy a whole casket to bury just remains or to have their small portion of collected remains cremated as well. Think about every car crash, building collapse, missing persons, and more not everyone gets the luxury of burying their loved one in an open casket and totally while it happens way more often than you think. Trust me on this one we buried a ‚Äútime capsule‚Äù of belongings after 7 years of searching for a murdered and missing family member it might be the only thing we get in terms of a burial and funeral."

Dedicated to it now so I don‚Äôt have to continue to have more work done. On the plus side my chronic migraines have reduced so I suspect it was al just related to the damaged teeth!

Skinpicking,f5phk3z,t3_domvtk,1572359528.0,Maybe try wearing long sleeves as much as possible for a while like distract yourself from being able to reach those areas and also don‚Äôt see it for a while. Try to stay dressed in long sleeves and maybe it will heal on its own by being ignored? If that makes sense. Like if you are going to shower or the toilet just get dressed up as soon as possible and try to stay busy while you aren‚Äôt in the longer sleeves so you don‚Äôt get tempted to pick. If you can keep it up long enough the irritations might go away and start to heal. Just a suggestion you might find it helpful but might not either.
Dissociation,f5pgspf,t3_doos91,1572358998.0,I just realized this is how I hiked so much when I was at my worst walking alone in a quiet place helped me get over it and i legit hiked while being unaware of it for a long time. One time I ran for 10 miles because I hadn‚Äôt felt like I had gone far enough until I saw the gps tracker mileage. Btw I‚Äôm not an avid runner I couldn‚Äôt run 2 miles if I tried and I somehow made it to 10 miles so just be safe and don‚Äôt like get lost or anything.

She needs bed baths because it takes two people to hold her stomach up and one to wipe underneath her chest and folds. She cannot walk or stand due only to her weight literally crushing her 80+ year old legs. She‚Äôs very sick with debilitating diabetes and she completely ignores all doctors orders about medicine and food and excercise.

Sad to think that I could ever be that person. Imagine not being able to perform CPR on a dying patient because of their weight. Imagine thinking a 5XL dress was made too small because it will not fit over your shoulders let alone your doubly as large mid section. Imagine not being able to go to a funeral home because they don‚Äôt ave tables large enough to hold you, forget surgery you could die before they cut you open because when you lay back your body is so heavy it causes you to stop breathing.  I grew up overweight in an overweight family please please take this seriously. It‚Äôs okay to love being big, to think it‚Äôs beautiful, or healthy but everyone should try to do better even if you are happy with how you are please please take health seriously. I‚Äôm currently still overweight and working on becoming healthier because I have nightmares of a doctor having to have a whole team and a mechanical lift just to position me to save my life. I‚Äôm terrified one day I‚Äôll be in an accident and they will need a tow truck to remove my body from the wreck. Please consider weight, health, and size please. I used to think everyone was beautiful regardless of shape, size, ability. Now I‚Äôm realizing healthy is the most beautiful thing you can be is healthy inside and out. Not trying to be rude just speaking from personal experience as someone who struggles with being overweight and desperately wants to feel healthy again."
tifu,f46ao18,t3_dj95o8,1571406325.0,"Anyone concerned about an outfit more than the person they ‚Äúlove‚Äù isn‚Äôt worth your time. You could wear a shirt that says ‚Äú im a dude and I‚Äôm gay as all hell and I love sucking dude dick‚Äù your outfit still would not determine your sexuality. Think about actors who wear outfits they may not have worn outside of work, dress codes for professions, it‚Äôs absolutely silly to think wearing a shawl, having small wrists or being comfortable In physical situations with others of the same gender makes you gay. So is every athlete? Physical therapist? Acrobat? Rescue worker? Anyone who touches another person of the same sex is gay? Every soldier who had to fly in a plane while shoved in like sardines, every choir member, every doctor?  I don‚Äôt think it works that way and anyone who would love you less because you might be gay or not isn‚Äôt worth your time. Love means you love someone no matter their outfit or preferences even if they prefer more than just you...."

It‚Äôs very hard to itch out issues to feel comfortable with ourselves but do not stop trying. I lowered my expectations instead of ‚Äú I‚Äôm gonna run the Moab 240 I changed them to I‚Äôm gonna do some yoga inspired stretches today and reflect on what‚Äôs been troubling me. I found a relationship through a dating website my first and only relationship not from immediate acquaintance. We‚Äôve been together for 7 years now and sometimes I question why I‚Äôm even still in it. We have a very rocky relationship because I struggle so much with my mental and emotional health I‚Äôm not a good partner. I do want to become a good partner and improve my actions and interactions. I found boxing two years ago and it quite literally saved my life. Fast forward to today my anxiety has kept me from that gym for a few months now because I feel ‚Äú why would they let me in here I‚Äôm so terrible‚Äù  we all have good and bad days and honestly the bad days are so debilitating sometimes but do not worry you really are doing great. Not everyone has this type of pain in their life and if they did hey old probably me in the same place as you. I learned recently I love coloring pages, painting old things, and learning how to run, do push ups and jump rope has given me a purpose in life. No matter how small these tasks are when  I complete them I feel normal again.  My suggestion would be not to dive into anything to fast because I met my bf online and immediately entered a serious long term relationship like I had never had. While I‚Äôm so incredibly thankful for his love, him not giving up on me, I‚Äôm also sad because I chose him over other opportunities and avenues and I‚Äôll never know if I took the right path. For me it‚Äôs about living for today, getting through today. Eating a chocolate bar, going for a walk by a lake, petting a dog I call that a joy of life. I hope you feel better soon!"

I wouldn‚Äôt consider it traumatic but when talking to therapists and doctors the would be like ‚ÄúOMG you have ptsd‚Äù and so on. I feel you are the only one who can judge what was traumatic for you and what‚Äôs not. We had family deaths, everyone does.y parents divorced when I was in grade 7. That‚Äôs the tip of the iceberg. Previous to that I was taunted and tortured daily by a class bully, I have disabilities and I was never a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù kid so understandably some of these things might be traumatic to others. I had food on the table every night. Decent food too. I had a roof over my head, clean cloths, electricity, got to do fun stuff. By letting others dictate what was traumatic I opened up the door to mental illnesses I never knew I had. The worst part of my life arguably came once I left the home so how could my home be as traumatic as my new life. Who knows it‚Äôs up to you to decide what to feel and how it may affect your life.
