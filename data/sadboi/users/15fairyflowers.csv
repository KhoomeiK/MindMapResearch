Anxiety,fcv1hq3,t1_fcv11ue,1577992696.0,"Any employer worth their salt who wants a long term, loyal employee will put in the initial work of training you up. Most important thing to remember is always ask questions! If you sign up with an agency itâ€™s their job to find people to cover assignments so you might have a weekâ€™s break here and there but theyâ€™ll always find you something else. And if you donâ€™t like the assignment or you feel itâ€™s too complicated you can always ask to be re-assigned and it wonâ€™t go against you with other employers! 

I did a CPD Level 3 in Admin and Secretarial. Sounds fancy but it took me two days and cost me about Â£25! And it was definitely a massive stepping stone for me. 

Best of luck! If you need any more advice just ask :)"
Anxiety,fcv0hgz,t1_fcv05mc,1577992149.0,"Everyone has to start somewhere. My way into Admin was to do a short course online so that I could add it to my resume and then I started temping. Each assignment gets you a bit more experience and employers will take you more seriously for permanent roles. My third assignment extended me for 2 and a half years total, and now I have a permanent position that I really like."

I find it hard to sleep at night because my brain is thinking and Iâ€™m terrified of forgetting something so I spend all that time at night looking things up and thinking that I donâ€™t get nearly enough sleep.

relationship_advice,fcjl1q3,t1_fcizo2r,1577691978.0,All feelings and ways of judging them are valid. Just because you donâ€™t feel that way doesnâ€™t mean everyone else must do the same. Variety make us human.

Heâ€™s pretty stuck in traditional m/f roles in our marriage. I really just want to move us back to my home country where our quality of life will be much better, we can sell up and eliminate our debt, enjoy longer sunsets and spend more time outside. Instead weâ€™re stuck in what feels like an eternal winter.
