Your feelings are entirely valid, and you have a right to be upset. It‚Äôs ok that you hurt yourself because that‚Äôs the way your mind knows how to cope with things - just realise that turning your pain on yourself isn‚Äôt fair on you either. 

Try to look after the wounds and maybe externalise your anger and sadness in other ways like writing down how you feel... you could write a letter to your parents about it, and then whether you show them the letter, keep it a secret, or even burn it, at least you have gotten it all out and helped your brain process your emotions.

One of the main things that helped me was adjusting my expectations of my life. I still cannot work (I also have comorbid mental health problems) and haven‚Äôt resumed education (dropped out of college at 17), and coming to terms with what I saw as ‚Äúbeing useless‚Äù took a lot of time and therapy. 

But you know what? You can still be happy and you can still find meaning in life...What are your sister‚Äôs special interests? I do a lot of crafting and knitting, and while I‚Äôm not well enough to make things to sell at the moment, I haven‚Äôt ruled out the option of starting my own business in the future. 

Another thing that helped me was when my therapist pointed out that, in this society, people are valued for what they can DO when it is more important to focus on who you ARE. Having autism and/or mental health problems does not make anyone a bad person. We can still love, we can still help people and make them laugh, and we can still contribute to the world just by being us. 

Maybe your sister‚Äôs contribution won‚Äôt be what she hoped - my parents had high hopes for me being a doctor or a lawyer! - but she can contribute in other ways through her unique view of the world and create her own expectations of what she wants her life to be. 

Finding out you have autism later in life isn‚Äôt a death sentence, but it does require a huge shift in almost everything you thought you knew and understood. It‚Äôs like a grieving process for the person you expected to be and, if therapy is an option, I would definitely recommend it... but there is hope and she is definitely not ‚Äòfucked for life‚Äô, she just needs to reevaluate what her life is going to look like and, tbh, having a diagnosis can make that a lot easier because rather than failing at things and not knowing why, you start to understand your limits and the reasons why you struggle with certain things. Some things you can adapt and work around; others will be a struggle your entire life, but knowing that, and knowing WHY, can be a huge step in learning how to cope. 

I wish you and your sister all the best. Hope that wasn‚Äôt too preachy."
