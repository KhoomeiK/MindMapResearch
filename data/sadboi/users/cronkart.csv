And when you’re in a depression you have to try super hard to remember that it’s just the chemicals talking, it isn’t really about your life, it’s just chemistry, and even though you have to feel the horrible feelings, you don’t have to believe what they’re telling you."

It’s a really clever play about how men see relationships and it also helps men see how women feel when they don’t listen. Maybe you guys should go for a date night. It’s a good humorous way to start a conversation. I really hope he learns to listen. When men learn that listening equals foreplay they get better at it. Unfortunately sex is their only driver. But it’s as important to them as emotional connection is to us so it’s not like their needs are wrong, they’re just very different. I guess the trick is making their needs work with our needs in order for both partners to be happy.

AskWomen,fa86a8l,t1_fa6orzg,1575841692.0,"I think the opposite is true. Not needing your boyfriend to listen to everything is important. Women talk way too much for men. I think women need to choose very carefully what they want to be heard and then men need to be careful about hearing those specific things. But women need to shut up half the time so that men can really hear the parts that are important. Women often think every little thing is gigantic. I’m a woman btw. I don’t think women take enough responsibility for their own happiness inside of a relationship. 

Young women think men are supposed to make them happy. They learn over their lifetime that they make themselves happy in a relationship."

AmItheAsshole,fa810t2,t3_e7t57k,1575840030.0,"You would get tons of support for your comment on r/childfree. Many parents feel this way and you just can’t say so in front of parents because it’s like a club thing or something, parents just jump on you and say that you’re bad for feeling this way. But so many parents do you feel this way because parenting is not all it’s cracked up to be and being free of kids is definitely a nice lifestyle. People that are child free rank happier on all the surveys because child raising is hard. Fulfilling yes but terribly hard. Your wife is awful to have done that to you, to have betrayed your counseling session like that. I am so sorry she did that to you. Maybe divorce will be better in terms of raising the kids. My cousin and her husband got divorced, they remained very amicable, they lived two streets apart and they split time with the kids which meant they had their time to themselves where they could have their own lives and then when they were with the kids they were very devoted to the kids. The kids felt like they had Full family lives because the parents got along so well and they live so close together, they still even went on family vacations together. I don’t know if your wife will be capable of that since she sounds so bitter but maybe you can get to that place. I wish you luck."

I don’t worry about what it is I just write it out and it usually makes a little story but sometimes it doesn’t make any sense at all but the thing that it does well is it unblocks me because it gets my Brain back in the habit of putting words together. Also there is absolutely no pressure about it because you’re not gonna submit it or anything so it’s literally just a brain exercise.

Here I’ll give you a prompt: I remember it was a rainy day, because my hair looked awful and I was feeling a bit blue.

Now you! Just write whatever comes to your mind one sentence at a time. Start with a sentence and just free right, a prompt can be something you overhear someone saying, it can be something you notice in the street, anything.

For example you can stock 30 condos at once, get a markup and a delivery fee from all 30 condos. Just let the sales people know that you’re in business and they’ll start putting you in touch with event coordinators Who have groups coming in. Sometimes hotels also own a block of condos. If you just deal with resort owners then you’ll only have to deal with 10 to 20 clients instead of hundreds of clients.

The gift baskets were usually just pretty basket with things like nice chocolates gourmet nuts maybe some dried fruit a nice bottle of wine maybe some fruit I can’t really remember this is about 15 years ago. Anyway it was a really good business I got to know the lady who are used for this pretty well and she made a lot of money and she could do it out of her home, and she just got really high end things at Costco and watch for sales and stuff like that and she had a nice little business doing it. This is before Pinterest and all that but I’m sure these days you could get fabulous ideas online. Good luck, I think you should do it. It’s a great little business.
