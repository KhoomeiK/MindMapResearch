climbharder,fpd38j9,t3_gc5pu7,1588518901.0,Looks like you are able to reach the hold but you just can't stick it.  If your main two points of contact are only the left foot and right hand I would focus on pulling as hard as I can with the right hand while squeezing my left glute at the dead point.
climbharder,fom3p6j,t1_fokqu5s,1587877453.0,"I do the same.

Day 1 : Hangboard + pull + core 

Day 2 : Push + core 

Day 3 : Rest or Legs"

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sDPQyWZJi0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sDPQyWZJi0)

One caveat I think is to be careful about keeping the back rounded for such a long time.  I think I developed mild spinal / posture issues from this.  Now I just try to keep a relatively more straight back and not worry about going as deep.  Also trying to balance it with back bending (cobra, bridge)."
climbharder,fmsjmnx,t1_fmsedmo,1586356774.0,"I haven't read Practical Programming - thanks for pointing that out I'll have a look!

If I am interpreting what you are saying correctly its that a novice athlete would benefit more from shorter cycles with a shorter rest/de-loading phase between cycles (if at all).

Does it have any impact on frequency of workouts in a week?"
climbharder,fmr3o1x,t3_fwkv37,1586313135.0,"I agree the last paragraph is a little puzzling - especially because I keep hearing the same thing essentially from various climbing folks - the more advanced the individual is the more frequent they can train.

I was under the impression that as one is starting out they are mainly targeting neuromuscular improvements.  If that is the case I would expect high frequency low volume programming to make sense.

Then as hypertrophy and other structural (tendon/ligament) components becomes more of a factor for improvement I would expect higher volume/load and lower frequency programming to make more sense.

Here is another way of looking at it -

>Rank novices can be trained close to the limit of their ability every time they train, precisely because that ability is at such a low level relative to their genetic potential. As a result of this relatively hard training, novices get strong very quickly. (Novices can recover from relatively hard training because they are weak, and the training is not really that hard in absolute terms.)

climbharder,fm122vh,t3_fqs3q0,1585670563.0,"A friendly climbing coach once told me to take a rest week when I feel like I start to plateau - which pretty much is another way of saying 'listen to your body'.

I think following a program is a great idea for staying accountable and monitoring progress, but its also important to be flexible with it when your body is telling you that the plan was too aggressive (or not aggressive enough ... which is usually not the case for someone starting a new hangboard training regime)."
climbharder,fm0xsyw,t3_fs9put,1585668267.0,Love the slots to vary edge depth - looks very practical!
climbharder,flzhqeb,t1_flz24bb,1585623957.0,"I agree - mounting the board higher will help you lower into the hang (so you don't swing) and finish the hang (so you don't dry fire or pop off and hurt your fingers/knees) in a much more controlled fashion.

Also - if you wanted to hang weight from a harness in the future then you may run into issues with a hangboard that is too close to the floor but I guess you could cross that bridge when you come to it.

Besides the swing and drop looks like you have good shoulder engagement and you are not arching your back too much - keep up the good work!"

I guess besides that what you are saying is to find ways to work around his anxiety so that he can still function such as proceeding with an over abundance of caution and washing everything three times for him?"
mentalhealth,flskzz0,t3_fqib8w,1585444544.0,"Hello u/rachelemmaDel,

I think a person close to me is on the brink of having a nervous meltdown and I'm afraid there are going to be serious consequences.  I think part of the problem is he has developed an intense germophobia to the point where he is hiding upstairs after a food delivery because he was worried that the virus would go through the cracks of the front door of his house.

Can you give any advice on how to be there for him and talk him off the ledge without being adversarial?

Thanks!"
climbharder,flhcbk3,t1_flendpu,1585160025.0,"That is surprising.  You would think that a shorter climber would require a lot more finger strength.

The tool puts me at a v2 level and I was able to send a few v3s on the moonboard so for me it seemed fairly accurate, although, I am probably in the normal distribution (5'10').

The cool thing to me is that there are people working on this stuff and offering it for free.  Hopefully with more data points such as yourself it can become more accurate!

Imagine we actually had a tool that was accurate and precise down to a V (-/+) grade for every body type.  That would be super helpful in determining where your bottleneck in training is.  Finger strength or something else.

Next someone has to develop a tool to measure technique! :)"

climbharder,fl7t55y,t1_fl7ocji,1584908826.0,"This is an important point.  Certain flexibility training can actually make you more prone to injury.  

My main goal is injury prevention so I tend to focus on strengthening my muscles in an end range of motion instead of looking for gains in flexibility.

For example, I'll do standing splits but not go so far that it is painful then I will focus on pushing up off the floor (also recovering from groin injury) and finally using my feet to bring myself up into a standing position."

Sorry - I'm not quite sure what you mean by 'repeater-esque' lat pull work.  Do you mean that you are planning to essentially hold it out in front of you as if you were doing a standing or kneeling front lever?  Sounds interesting, though!"
climbharder,fkyc0xf,t1_fkyb27m,1584645738.0,"Interesting!  So I guess you are recommending a single solid piece if I want to go portable.  Would you ever add weight to such a device or still just use it for warming up, repeaters or min edge depth training?"

\[edit\] I am also thinking about purchasing a proper weight belt for better back support

[EDIT]
see link for setup - you can create the overhand where you like then clip the biner to your harness

Here was my full workout today - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynSNMrBtjto&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynSNMrBtjto&feature=youtu.be)

I switched my goal to strength and conditioning to prepare myself to the loads that I plan to put myself under when I get back to climbing.  I am tracking my daily medial epicondyle pain levels in certain movements that cause it and slowing adding those back in under bodyweight.

I wish I had some more climbing specific movements I could use to train my skills.  Looked at the other reddit thread - [https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/fjg247/training\_using\_limited\_equipment\_during/](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/fjg247/training_using_limited_equipment_during/)

Maybe will try some of those footwork drills or come up with some myself.

Hope this gives you a little inspiration u/Carliios  

Would love to hear what routines you came up with!"
