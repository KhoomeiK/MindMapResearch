WitchesVsPatriarchy,fqnn5wm,t1_fqmxfos,1589497871.0,"The bubonic plague, the disease that caused the Black Death, has been around for centuries.  It's still present in some developing countries (fortunately it is easily treated by modern medicine).

But the huge outbreak which wiped out an estimated 60% of Europe's population, and thus caused enormous sociological changes, happened in the mid 1300's.  This outbreak is what is generally meant when people talk about the Black Death.  Some historians even think that 60% is a conservative estimate, and that the death toll could have been as high as 80%.  Whole towns and villages in some places were literally wiped out.  And because there were so few people left, the circumstances allowed for lower class people and women to become more powerful in their communities.

Witch hunts have happened throughout history, coinciding with 'witch scares' (i.e. rising religious paranoia) but they didn't really become widespread in Europe until a good while after the Black Death.  The famous 'handbook' for would-be witch hunters, the Mallues Maleficarum, was published in 1487.  It was really only after this date that folks in Europe went crazy with witch hunting."

I just think it's funny that you know nothing about me as a person or an educator, and yet you've thought it appropriate to imply that 1. I created a space where bigotry would flourish in my classroom, and 2. That I'm politically blind and would inadvertently spread propaganda.  What do you even gain from making that suggestion?  If you and I were to have a decent discussion about politics, we would probably find vastly more points of agreement than disagreement.  Not everyone is a political enemy, and approaching people in bad faith (i.e. your 'rhetorical device' which suggested I would have taught my students about WW2 and Nazism in a positive light...real civil way to start a conversation...) achieves nothing."

That includes imparting the critical thinking tools to judge whether arguments are tenable, academic sources are credible etc. 

What it categorically does not mean is platforming both sides equally, as if both arguments are totally valid - because many times (of course) they are not.  But it was my job as a teacher to give kids the evaluative tools to figure that out for themselves.

From what I saw when I was teaching (I'm not a teacher any more) the kids are alright.  Had a class once where one of the boys, about 13 years old, made a homophobic comment, and all of his classmates turned and stared at him: ""Dude, what the hell!"" ""Why would you say that?!"" etc.  It was a beautiful thing to see.

On another occasion, I saw a boy throw a Nazi salute.  I'm pretty sure he was just doing it to get a rise (he was only 11, and not the brightest).  But of course the school took it seriously.  I was supervising the detention room one day when he was there, and there were also some older kids in detention for not doing their homework.  They'd heard on the school grapevine what this kid was in detention for -- and they promptly took the opportunity to just lecture the hell out of him about what he had done.  As the teacher on duty, I probably should have stopped them and told them to sit down and be quiet (they were in detention after all), but I let them say their piece.  They shouldn't have to go to a school where kids casually commit hate crimes because they think it's funny to upset people.

When I was doing my teacher training, I was really specifically told that I could not present a biased view of politics.  If I was going to do a session on something political, I'd need to present both sides of the argument.

If your daughter tells you about that teacher doing something like that again, definitely  complain to the school because you have solid grounds for a complaint.  Teachers are supposed to help kids learn how to critically evaluate arguments and evidence, so they  can make up their own minds.  They definitely aren't supposed to spoonfeed kids their own political opinions.

\[EDIT: I've had more responses to this comment than I initially anticipated.  A handful of people have suggested that I essentially created a discursive space within my classroom where bigoted opinions would be encouraged - because of my statement: *'If I was going to do a session on something political, I'd need to present both sides of the argument.'*

Just because you are talking about two sides of an argument, it **does not** mean you are saying, 'There are two sides to this argument -- and both are equally valid!!' because that's clearly not the case in many situations.  And, indeed, if I made the value judgement that 'both of these arguments are equally valid!', I would be politically influencing students and forcing that idea onto them -- which (as I said) is something that teachers **should not** be attempting to do.

I draw your attention to my statement: *'Teachers are supposed to help kids learn how to critically evaluate arguments and evidence, so they can make up their own minds.'*  This is what responsible teachers should be doing.  For middle-school age kids, the concept of right-wing and left-wing has little meaning to them.  But you can get the kids to a point where they are asking decent, critically aware questions: 'Where did this news source come from?  Do the facts check out?  What did the author stand to gain by writing this?'  And then, armed with the skills to critically evaluate the media that they consume, they'll be able to make up their own minds about things (and hopefully be able to smell the bullshit for themselves).\]"

Throughout high school and university, I felt like I was pretty much invisible to men. Never had any guys act interested in me except for a couple of times when I really put a ton of effort into my outfit and makeup before going to a party. But I never blamed men. It never even entered into my head to blame them. The only hatred it fuelled was hatred of myself.

I could have become really angry and bitter, like an incel. I could have interpreted the situation as: 'men are so shallow, they only notice me when I'm wearing a ton of makeup and a skimpy outfit, why are all men like this etc.' But I didn't.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fovlrv6,t3_g9qro9,1588103470.0,"Trying to pursue passions in a professional capacity has actually done me more harm than good, I think.

I'm really passionate about wine and culinary culture, so after working as a sommelier for a while I decided I should apply for jobs at prestigious wine companies. I was offered a couple of interviews. I was so blinded by what I saw as an amazing opportunity to follow my passion that I ignored something that I should have paid attention to - the fact that the offices had a bad atmosphere, the people interviewing me seemed awkward and standoffish, the salary offering mediocre. Nonetheless, I took the job that I was offered. Ended up quitting 10 months later because I hated it so much.

After that experience, I thought I'd do something different and follow another passion. My degree was in English lit, and I love reading. I thought I'd be a great English teacher because I have so much of a love for books and reading. But, man, if anything that passion brought challenges. I found it so hard to connect with the kids who didn't also love English. Didn't help that I was teaching at quite a rough, inner-city school. Some kids loved the fact that I recommended books to them, talked to the librarian to see if we could get the funds for new books, and ran a book club at lunch time. Most of them did not. I dealt with some terribly behaved kids. One boy nearly threw a desk at me, and came at me with his fists raised like he was going to punch me (I'm a petite woman and he was like a large 15 year old). By the end of the school year, I was literally sick from stress and having anxiety attacks. Following my passion into teaching did me no favours.

Now, I work in copywriting for a small company that makes gardening/agricultural equipment - something that I have little more than a passing interest in - and it's great. My work/life balance is awesome because once I walk out the office, I fully do not think about it. My colleagues are nice enough, but I've no interest in hanging out with them outside of work. Having two completey separate spheres of my life in a way makes me feel more fulfilled. 

Some people wouldn't like it, but I've found that this is the balance which works best for me. Pursuing a passion  (especially when your happiness is compromised because of it) might not actually be worth it."

\- par-boil the potatoes until they are half-way soft

\- drain them, and then dump them out onto kitchen paper to dry out a bit.  Wait until they have cooled a bit (ideally wait until steam has stopped coming off them - moisture is the enemy of crispiness)

\- Using a neutral oil that can get up to a relatively high heat (I tend to use sunflower oil), pour enough oil into the pan so that the bottom of the pan is well coated.  I always add what I think will be 'enough', and then add a bit more.

\- Heat it up.  Wait for the oil to look shimmery.

\- Fry the suckers **in batches.** Do not crowd the pan.  This is the key point I think.  The way the guy does them in this gif recipe, there's no way the potatoes would get properly crispy - there's too much stuff already in the pan.  You want all of the potatoes to get direct heat from the pan."

For someone who has apparently studied a brand of Christian theology (for two years?), it sounds to me like you've missed the subtlities. The fact that you weren't willing to engage any of the actual theological points I stated also calls into question your understanding of this. 'oh yeah, that's just one interpretation!' is not an engaged response. If your knowledge of theology is so in-depth as a result of your studying, why haven't you offered any interpretation yourself, using other biblical evidence to push your argument that the god of the NT and OT are completely, functionally the same thing with no differences whatsoever? 

Also, the fact that my interpretation is essentially 'Consider how the incarnation of Christ alters the way God functions in the Bible', and you are dismissing this as 'just one of hundreds of ways of interpreting the Bible' belies your lack of understanding of Christian theology. The incarnation of christ is hugely important - there's even a whole branch of Christian theology (Christology) which studies the complexities of Christ as incarnation, father, son and spirit etc. It is of fundamental significance.

This is the same reason that Christians don't have to eat kosher food like Jewish people do, for example - because the new covenant in christ literally 'frees' them from having to follow old testament laws. There's a lot of theology that functionally separates Christianity and Judaism. Christians believe that God is totally forgiving because christ sacrificed himself to cancel out the 'debt' of everyone's sins and wrongs, so to speaks. That's why it's possible for the OT god to be a dick, and the NT god to be forgiving - because the incarnation of jesus essentially changed the nature of God. It's weird, but it's interesting.

The tl;dr is that, yes, Parliament *technically* does have a power of Impeachment, specifically for ministers who have engaged in illegal activity, but that it hasn't been used in years (1806 was the last time, in fact).  To get rid of a simply 'bad' Prime Minister, Parliament would have to propose a 'vote of no confidence' in their government, which would have to pass.

This makes more sense if you understand that the Government and Parliament are different things, kind of in the same way that the White House and Congress are different things.

The way we end up with a Prime Minister is different to the way Americans end up with their President, as far as I understand it.  In the UK, we vote in the General Election for which specific political party we want to be in power, not for a specific prime-ministerial candidate.   The person who is the leader of the winning party becomes the Prime Minister (i.e. because they are the leading minister within that party).

This is why you sometimes see a change of Prime Minister within the elected party's term: in 2016, David Cameron resigned as leader of the ruling party (the Conservatives) so by default he also stepped down as Prime Minister.  Theresa May was chosen by the Conservatives to be the party leading - so she, by default, became Prime Minister.

Now, Theresa May is a good example, because in 2018, Parliament wanted to get rid of her as PM because of the way she was handling Brexit.  So, they held what is called a **'vote of no confidence'**, which is exactly what it sounds like.  Parliament -- which is made up of locally elected representatives ('Members of Parliament') -- can propose a motion of no confidence in the government (i.e. the administration of the ruling party).  If the vote of no confidence passes, a new General Election is held, which gives the public the chance to vote for a different political party, resulting in a different Prime Minister and government.

Even my lawyer friend, who often works 13-14 hours days, reads fiction, plays video games, and learns German in her rare downtime. Personally, I have so many hobbies that I struggling balancing them all. For instance, I have repairs that I need to make to my motorcycle, but I’m procrastinating by doing a dress making project. And before i can get into the garage to work on my bike I’ll need to sort through all my gardening stuff which is rapidly taking over the space... etc."

I’m looking to get out of the teaching profession for that exact reason.  You get the summer off, but the rest of the year? Hope you enjoy never spending time on your hobbies or seeing your friends and family!"
