I said that they need to stop drinking. But they need a replacement coping mechanism as fast as possible; like seeing a therapist as you say.

There is a reason why people resort to many different things to cope with lifes stressors. Healthy or destructive, these things are a way to mentally deal with their problems.

There is also a very good chance they are addicted to alcohol as they say they have abused it for a long time. They way to safely beat addictions is not to rip it out of your life (that may work for some, but it will fail for most and potentially cause more problems).

This person needs to stop the drinking and smoking as soon as possible, but cold turkey is not the way to do it."

Not living in extremely stressful, inhumane conditions does not equal a utopian society. I personally believe that a capitalist type system is what should be; there must be an incentive to put in more effort, and being more productive/effective should put you in a better position than the next man who doesnt put in that effort.

However, I also believe that the conditions that some people are enduring should not exist in such a rich society. Needless suffering on this level is cruel, and is not a necesary product of a capitalist system. It is a product of those at the top of the pile not giving a fuck.

There is nothing impractical or utopian about allowing people to take sick days, or have basic living conditions affordable to people who do not want to work over 40 hours a week. People are working more than they ever have, despite increased productivity and all that.

I am sure we both have a lot to agree on even if we do not draw the same conclusions on how to reach those ideas. If you were in a bad financial situation, I am sure you would want a system that wouldnt let you fall flat if you couldnt keep your face against the grindstone for a few weeks here and there, which in reality isnt present in the slightest.
