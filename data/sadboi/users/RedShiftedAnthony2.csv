I never claimed they lied. To do so would be as ridiculous as saying that actors lie during a performance. But that's what this show is, a performance by actors. 

I'd also liked to point out that there's nothing wrong with having a scripted D&D performance as entertainment. I went out of my way to clarify that. It simply wasn't to my taste, which again, is my opinion. 

I've been part of the fanbase for years and the one thing I've noticed is that criticism of NADDPOD is consistently put down. A fanbase who denies or outright stifles criticism while only allowing views that are positive of the subject are indeed toxic."

I really enjoyed the beginning arcs of the podcast. It felt very raw and unscripted. I feel like it culminated in the Tales from the Crick story arc. Offhand comments were seamlessly drawn into the story in a very organic way. 

From there, though, I really feel like they took a much more scripted approach and it really showed. So many things happened where they tried to make it *look* like it was unscripted, but it was painfully obvious that it was. 

The second unpopular opinion I have is that it relied on throwbacks a little too much considering the length of the podcast. It reminded me of post-Fox episodes of Arrested Development where they'd use throwbacks to jokes now years old to illicit a couple of cheap laughs. It sometimes hit the mark, but was often times cringy. 

Not sure what the next campaign will be like, but I guess one word of advice would be to make it shorter.

F13thegame,fnl36gp,t3_g1ld8p,1587046053.0,"A personal anecdote: 

TL;DR: Do your research and make sure they're actually teaming first.

I was playing solo in a lobby with my mic on. Another guy was also on who seemed pretty normal, if not new to the game, so we ended up running stuff a lot together. There was another group of two players who were obviously on a party chat together, but they would occasionally jump to game chat, ostensibly to check out what I and this other guy were saying. One of those was a person we'll call Kerri who was a level 150.

The lobby itself was crap, with myself and my new friend running most of the objectives. My new friend was quickly killed and came back as Tommy. Most of the lobby was killed by then and not a lot was done, so we figure our best shot is to kill Jason. I have the sweater anyways, so why not? We go around looking for a bladed weapon to deal more damage, but are having zero luck. We go down to the boathouse and find Kerry there, where she had been the entire match, essentially. She had been on game chat and I asked her to help us kill the Jason since she had a machete. She struck me instead and danced, so we figured she was a troll. We left and ran other objectives and eventually survived. 

Next match, her friend is chosen as Jason, who proceeds to not touch her. She actually steals the boat we put together and just sits on it, getting on the mic to call us names. Jason,of course, does nothing. Her friend eventually jumps on the mic and straight up tells us he doesn't think we were teaming (the previous Jason didn't even have a mic) and proceeds to let us get the fuse in. I straight up actually let him kill me because he needs the xp and he appreciated it.

Skip to the next time we're in the lobby and this chick goes OFF the rails, accusing us of teaming with the Jason that supposedly was chasing her the entire time, saying we went down there to try and kill her, something thats obviously impossible to do. She starts calling me every name in the book, including making some pretty homophobic comments (granted, being as sassy as I am, I gave as good as I was getting). She rants and rails at the new players that entered the lobby on the mic trying to ""warn"" them of us. They make the astute observation that the guy we were supposed to be teaming with left the game entirely already and didn't even have a mic when he was in it. 

Next match, she suicides when I am chosen as Jason and everyone else in the lobby is laughing about how wrong and petty she was being. 

Suffice to say, we all hate teamers, but be sure the people you are accusing of teaming are actually teamers before taking action. Otherwise, you just look like a petulant child."

I agree that it sucks that straight men are pigeonholed to act in a certain way, but there's nothing wrong with acknowledging that they are indeed pigeonholed in this way, which is what I was saying. Me saying that straight men don't typically pose in this way is absolutely true (and again, this is a shame). Even you have to admit that butt play among straight men, including pegging, is exceedingly rare. I'd even go so far as to say that straight men themselves are the main culprit in this, not gay men fetishizing and questioning straight men when they move from the social norms.

I, too, get irritated when I see the fetishization of people like Sean Mendes (for several reasons, but also the fact that he's straight), but these arent the same situations.

indianapolis,fbyjceh,t3_ef2xnt,1577218355.0,"So, for full disclosure/context: I'm male, 33, and a gay, white-presenting Latino. 

I was a nontraditional student at IUPUI, starting school at the ripe old age of 24. A few years into my degree, I needed a place close to campus and found a cheap place in the Haughville/Stringtown area, which is directly west of the river. Originally, I moved to near Michigan and Lynn. 

I had a lot of people telling me to be careful because the area was ""dangerous."" What I soon found out was that they meant ""full of nonwhite people."" The area doesnt look particularly good, admittedly, but it's not bad and it's getting better every year. For instance, two new apartment complexes have been built (near 10th and White River and another currently almost done on White River and Michigan) and they look like they cater to lots of people working/going to IUPUI and the various hospitals around there. I myself didnt have a car for a long time and often walked/biked/bussed and never once had problems. I even would walk home from as far as Metro and Tini at 3 AM and never once encountered issues. People really just want to be left alone, and if you leave them alone, they leave you alone.

I later moved a mile or two down Michigan to near Michigan and Tibbs. The area is possibly technically considered Fairfax territory, but I dont have a conclusive answer there. I live in a house that I rent (now that I have graduated and have a decent job). From what I can tell, all of the houses around here are filled with families. I'm on good terms with my neighbors and we watch out for one another. 

All of that to say: yes, the area has a bad reputation and it probably deserved it at one point. But some of that stems from white people who have never lived here. The area is getting better every year and it is slowly becoming an area of investment. Lots of people are looking to flip houses over here. I moved here in 2013-2014 and have lived here since. I personally like the area, but that experience might not be universal (this, why I included those details about myself at the top)."

At any rate, rockin bod, dude."
SuicideWatch,fbvdvlx,t1_fbtkqp2,1577129398.0,"Hey.  A lot of people have already commented, but I figured I'd add my two cents, for what it's worth. 

So, when I was a kid (for context, I'm 33 now), I wanted to be a ""scientist."" Now, at a young age, you dont really know what that is-- a catch all that could be a doctor, a chemist, an engineer, etc. 

Anyways, when I was in high school, I had a love of math and physics, so I figured I'd go to college for physics. Well, turns out, that costs a lot of money. My parents were well off, but never saved any money and I didnt qualify for financial aid. And my grades weren't great, so scholarships werent really a viable option. So, I ended up working for several years in, essentially, manual labor. It wasnt until I was about 23 or 24, the age at which the US federal government stops looking at your parents' taxes for financial aid consideration, that I decided to go back to school. 

Are you familiar with ""imposter syndrom?"" It's this feeling that you're simply pretending to be something and that everyone knows you're not what you think you are. A lot of STEM people go through this in college, especially when they struggle. I felt like an idiot and that all of my classmates were doing waaay better than me. It really got me down and made me want to give up a lot of the time. And to be honest, sometimes I didnt put in all of my effort and I really suffered because of it. I was a highly esteemed math tutor, but still felt like I didnt know shit, especially compared to my colleagues who seemed to know everything. But, eventually, as I stuck with it and I continued my studies, I found that other people were really strugglin, too. And I became friends with them and we got through it together.

I graduated with a decent GPA and I have a steady job as a scientist for a pharmaceuticals company. Is my life perfect? No. Do I sometimes still struggle with imposter syndrome? Absolutely. But I can honestly say that I am aware that that's something that's in my head only. And I manage to get through it. 

Listen, I dont know you or your situation, but I just wanted to let you know that what you're feeling is probably way more common than what you think, especially in something as rigorous as medicine and whatnot. I would urge you to not give up."

These are not history professors or people with a genuine interest in history. These are, usually, the type of people who think that history as a subject is as useful as algebra 2. They otherwise dont care about history and they dont care about it from an academic level. No, instead, they watch random youtube videos and the ocassional History channel show. They wholeheartedly believe that slavery was not the cause of the Civil War and that Hitler was a product of his time and, well, at the very least, he brought Germany back from the brink of destruction
