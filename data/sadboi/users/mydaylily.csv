Anxiety,famg478,t3_e9w96n,1576203042.0,I'm going through a regret stage now in my early 40s. I've known I wasted time being anxious all through life...but for some reason now it just sunk  in.  I think because I'm just too damn tired to care so much about what other people think.  I'm going  to be selfish (selfish for someone with GAD) and put myself first...but still be kind and mindful of others. Surprisingly I'm doing pretty well and after about 6 months of this change...my relationships are slowly becoming more meaningful.
datasets,famehm0,t3_e9rm2r,1576201920.0,What are you looking to do in stats? A master's in stats or the equivalent experience can land you in a good career...good pay and interesting work.  But it depends on if you want to do methods development or run the analyses for a research project. I have a master's in stats and PhD in another field... now I'm faculty in as data science department.  The stats degree was the best career move by far.
