Scams,fmj0uar,t1_fmj0meo,1586120772.0,I messaged him over phone number. And I asked a silly question like “this isn’t a scam right?” And of course he’s like “why would I do that to my fellow citizen” LMAO and he sent a picture of himself. Like duh of course a scammer isn’t going to admit it’s a scam!!
EatingDisorders,fmizdzq,t3_fuyyqg,1586119974.0,"It kills me to read this. Although I am an 18 year old girl, I know where you are coming from when it’s the parasite (ed) eating at you every waking day and doesn’t end. I started paying attention to my weight and what I ate when I was around 13 years old. I remember my moms boyfriend telling me that I should start paying attention to what I eat and start making healthier choices. I had always been chubby. I think that is what started it for me in middle school was that input. I remember going on a trip with my school in about 7th grade. We went on long hikes and moved around more than I would have at home. When I returned a week later my moms bf made the comment that I had lost weight it looked like. And from there I became involved in running which I pushed myself to the point of almost puking. I started not eating and noticed I lost weight quickly. On top of that I joined this after school gymnastics for like beginners or whatever to get more exercise in, the gym teacher I had even made a comment and said “you’re really skinny.” I ate “normally” after about a year of that going to be a freshman in high school. After a breakup in my junior year I had gotten really depressed and sat and played video games everyday after school locking myself in my dark room. It was the only escape from reality that I had and I had such bad anxiety it was hard to leave the house. I had gained like 20 pounds and felt disgusting after junior year I started to starve myself and run again and of course it worked. I spent all of last summer isolated in my grandmas house no one home all day no one seeing my unhealthy patterns. It was the perfect opportunity for this Ed to take over once again. I would go for walks and runs feeling so weak it was so hard to live regular life, it felt like walking through water because I was so weak. Now over half way through my senior year I still struggle with an eating disorder and disordered eating starving myself and overeating or eating or over exercising. I started to drink in December and got into another relationship thinking it would make me feel better. It did the opposite and didn’t do shit for that lol. I left because surprise they don’t fix you! I do not know where I was going with this comment other than trying to share my mom view and experiences with living with an ed. Also because I think we are all struggling right now being trapped inside with even more access to digging a negative hole for ourselves. I just want you to know that you are not alone and life likes to test us. I am no where near where I want to be in life and in fact it’s only starting for me. But knowing I am not alone makes me feel a lot better. I just know that backing up for a even a day and reflecting may help you with a steady plan to get on and stay on. Don’t listen or compare yourself to other people’s “perfect” diets or workouts blah blah. Do you do you do you! I am still learning to stick with what I know works for me because I’m like omg I do not look how I want maybe I should try what this person is doing all that shit. I hope that you find a healthy balance for yourself and deal with your ed in the proper ways. I don’t know if you can “fully” recover from one because I know damn well I haven’t and it’s been around for a few years. All I know is that surrounding yourself with people that have the same motives in life will put you where they are. So even if it means being along for awhile and just working on yourself do it. It’s never too late. Sorry for the rant!! But I wanted to make sure you everyone else reading this is not alone :)"

Scams,fmi9e1t,t3_fvgo52,1586105057.0,So I had posted some pictures of my iPhone XR I am trying to sell this morning to eBay. Moments later I revived a message from this guy saying he wants to purchase. He is claiming to send the money through PayPal and I won’t receive the money in my account until I go to the post office and confirm the shipping number. When he sent the link he said it would be in my junk mail. I had sent him a request through PayPal and it still says pending. I’m just confused on how this buying and shipping stuff resonates with when and how I revive the money. Remind you this is my first time selling something off of eBay or anywhere lol. If someone could confirm if this is a scam or not that’d be great!!! I plan on going to the post office tomorrow morning and asking.

isthisascam,fmi78bq,t3_fvgewg,1586103835.0,So I posted my first post on eBay today and I don’t know if this person is trying to scam me or not. I set the price for $450 and he sent me $550 in a junk mail email that required next day delivery. But he said the money will show up pence I verify the shipping number through PayPal?? I’m just really confused if someone could help that’d be great.
