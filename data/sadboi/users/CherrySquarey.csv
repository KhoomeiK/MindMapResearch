funny,fk3ybpn,t1_fk3se53,1583849275.0,"First, the ""it's not going to kill you"" argument. If the virus is allowed to run through a population unmitigated, cases quickly overwhelm hospitals, so not only are people with the virus in a treatable condition not able to get treatment, people with chronic conditions that are normally treatable, and people with sudden - also normally treatable - health issues like stroke or heart attack, or even something as common as appendicitis, are all unable to access care. This is avoidable mortality. 

Second, the virus has already disrupted supply lines. The West is entirely too dependent on China's exports, and some people have realized this. Others have noticed that toilet paper is selling out so they decide they need to buy some extra as well, and it snowballs from there. Most health authorities in my country are advising households to prepare for the eventuality of being confined to the home for three weeks.

All of these things have the potential to degrade the social order, so yes, people are panicking. We haven't seen anything like this in modern times or living memory. It is shaking the foundations of human superiority and the surety of society, which most people believe is infallible.

Summary Report 4
We present case fatality ratio (CFR) estimates for three strata of 2019-nCoV infections. For cases detected in Hubei, we estimate the CFR to be 18% (95% credible interval: 11%-81%). For cases detected in travellers outside mainland China, we obtain central estimates of the CFR in the range 1.2-5.6% depending on the statistical methods, with substantial uncertainty around these central values. Using estimates of underlying infection prevalence in Wuhan at the end of January derived from testing of passengers on repatriation flights to Japan and Germany, we adjusted the estimates of CFR from either the early epidemic in Hubei Province, or from cases reported outside mainland China, to obtain estimates of the overall CFR in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of approximately 1% (95% confidence interval 0.5%-4%). It is important to note that the differences in these estimates does not reflect underlying differences in disease severity between countries. CFRs seen in individual countries will vary depending on the sensitivity of different surveillance systems to detect cases of differing levels of severity and the clinical care offered to severely ill cases. All CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously at the current time as the sensitivity of surveillance of both deaths and cases in mainland China is unclear. Furthermore, all estimates rely on limited data on the typical time intervals from symptom onset to death or recovery which influences the CFR estimates."
