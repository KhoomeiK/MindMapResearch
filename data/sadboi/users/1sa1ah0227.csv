Service manager pulled all vehicle records and so did service advisors and it was shown that oil change intervals were not followed. All suggested maintenance items were declined, and he openly admitted to having his oil changed previously (12k miles ago) at a 20$ lube shop in the middle of nowhere.

BMW cried improper lubrication and declined all repair requests to fixed his car.  Last I heard he got a lawyer involved and when it was all said and done bmw gave him a very slight discount on a new engine.

From a customer's stand point its all about following service intervals properly, keeping records, and most importantly keeping your cool. Service manager at the dealership here would have helped the customer out if he didn't cuss every one at the store up and down."
