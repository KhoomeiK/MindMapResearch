vaporents,fnsnif4,t1_fnsmz89,1587225201.0,Listen this is my last response to you.  I get it.  People who have been doing this for a while get tired of the same questions.  If the Mods feel this post is low quality than just delete it it's not that serious but people like you raging and going straight to insults is childish and unnecessary.
vaporents,fnsmp3h,t1_fnsmg6v,1587224747.0,Or you could not respond to a question you think isn't worthy of a response.  Got to be a better use of your time and energy than shitting on Reddit posts right?

AskReddit,flbate9,t1_flba6ht,1585000863.0,"If by ""Hot Ketchup"" you were referring to it being thick than Tomato Bisque would much better.  Could also just have been a poorly made Tomato soup you had."
AskReddit,flb9kol,t3_fnshv7,1585000152.0,"I was taught that  ""bisque"" references a soup made from a Broth or stock of crustaceans. I have seen bisque made without (I make a great bacon, butternut squash, and chive bisque myself.). In this case the bisque would have a smoother texture  due to the straining of the tomato. I normally see bisques have some sort of cream or milk added as well.  Could be more to it but that's what I remember off the top of the head."

CBD,fkeuwhi,t3_fi2snl,1584121187.0,Tikun Avidekel and the high CBD Tincture at GrowHealthy have done wonders for my panic attacks and anxiety.  Stanley Brothers 20 to 1 also works well.
depression,fjv2iha,t3_fexklp,1583622558.0,No.  Not voluntarily and I sometimes feel good about that..... then the panic attack comes..... so much for that.
seizures,fjtddms,t1_fjt7jv3,1583606647.0,High CBD Tincture(liquid oil) from GrowHealthy in FL.  This and Avidekel from Tikun both are great for my panic attacks and seizures.
seizures,fjt531t,t1_fjt4eon,1583604206.0,Oh okay well I don't have any issues with nausea but I hope you find what you need.  The CBD is use is from a dispensary and has some THC as I was told it CAN (don't know if this is proven) help with effectiveness but it stops the anxiety attacks extremely well and helps ease any seizure activity.  I have also heard (but haven't tried) that biting into a whole lemon (take a chunk and eat) is a great natural way to help with panic attacks.
seizures,fjt33g0,t3_feq9uq,1583603223.0,Not sure if this is exactly the same as I don't have any nausea but I have had seizures that lead to panic attacks and Vice versa.  Currently managing these with CBD and Keppra.  Don't know exactly what you need to know but feel free to ask.

FLMedicalTrees,f0ot4j7,t1_f0orknv,1568819638.0,This is true.  I have had very few complaints about Tikun products or Vidacann as a dispensary. Definitely a small inconvenience but nothing compared to vaping a potentially dangerous cart.
FLMedicalTrees,f0jsk59,t1_f0jro83,1568662035.0,Called Tampa and St Pete and both said they were pulled because of crystallization.
FLMedicalTrees,f0jsh5g,t1_f0jrggd,1568661979.0,This is exactly what I was told.  Don't know much about CBD so need to research if this is valid or not. They have tincture but I haven't had good experience with tincture effects.
FLMedicalTrees,f0jqjyd,t3_d52wvm,1568660656.0,Vidacann has pulled all Avidekel carts.  This stuff was my only go to for high CBD with little THC.  Anyone know where I can get some outside of Vidacann or have any CBD vape recommendations?
