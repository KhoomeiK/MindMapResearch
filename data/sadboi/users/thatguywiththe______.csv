Dynavap,fr4ds3k,t3_gmefny,1589884963.0,"I like mine a lot! It's my first dynavap. I did upgrade to and do prefer the titanium tip, it's a little harder to accidentally combust, which I did a few times with the stainless steel. I really like playing with the stem to get different hits. Once I got used to the warmth from it I actually prefer the m stem to the bb9 attachment, mostly because of that airport."

I also am still waiting for my induction heater set up to arrive so I'm stuck torching it for now, which I'm not a huge fan of, but it definitely does the trick."
vaporents,fqz673l,t3_gloyqh,1589760713.0,"If you have the money for a mighty, it's worth looking into a dynavap + induction heater set up. If you get a battery powered IH it could be a pretty ideal portable set up and the dynavap really doesn't require much flower at all per cap."
Dynavap,fqz3rdi,t1_fqz200e,1589759382.0,"I just got my 2020M about ten days ago and quickly upgraded to the titanium tip, which I HIGHLY recommend. It's not for everyone, I think the stainless steel actually hits a little harder and feels more jointlike but I much prefer the quick cooldown time and lighter feel to the vapor. It feels less like smoking out of something I could keep in a toolbox in the garage, but I could understand liking that grittiness. Anyway. 

I had gotten the solo 2 recently as well and enjoy using both but use the dynavap much more often because of how much less flower it needs. I have no idea how it works either. But I'm glad it does. I also got a globe bong from sneaky Pete Vapes but now hardly use it and will probably pass it along to a friend. I really enjoy using the airport on the m stem. Also picked up a dynacoil which I haven't used yet because I'm afraid of my tolerance getting worse."

Also, how you grind and pack it will effect the experience, play around with a coarse grind loosely packed. Too tightly and it might not vape evenly."

GhostRecon,fl0pr4t,t3_fluned,1584712949.0,"Just picked it up, 20 hours into it. This is my first Ghost Recon game. I don't prioritize the campaign much but run around getting gear and stumbling onto outposts. The campaign that I've seen so far is pretty cheesy but coherent at least. I think the update on the 24th will be good, I look forward to no tiered gear and a more punishing and consistent health system- I've died many times but only gotten to that limping phase once. 

Honestly though, I'm hoping the update is bringing some quality of life improvements they haven't mentioned. You cannot holster every weapon at once yet civilians always panic when they see the gun you can' never put down. More than a few traversal glitches here and there, it can be a bit rough. The movement has a more weighted feel to it than wildlands but I'm not sure about the execution, it feels a bit wonky sometimes and can be difficult to get your character to go or face which way they need to. If the movement was more responsive like Wildlands or The Division 2 I'd enjoy it much more. 

Overall, it's messy, but I'm enjoying it. Because of the bugs it's rarely boring but occasionally frustrating. Honestly the AI seem good to be on Advanced. It reminds me of the earlier stages of The Division and I'm hoping they can turn it around. If the game had some general improvements and ran as I believe it's intended it can be great. It's awesome when it works. Like a Phantom Pain's cheesy knock off little cousin."
