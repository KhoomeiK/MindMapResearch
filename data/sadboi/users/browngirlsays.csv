I felt frustrated because no matter how hard I was trying to explain, he was not understanding and was playing blame games instead. 

Ended up telling him we’re not compatible and should separate. 

After hanging up he sends me a pic quote that says - “Never leave a true relationship for a few faults. Nobody is perfect. Nobody is correct. In the end affection is always greater than perfection.” 

Sigh."

I was in that exact same phase once. I know what it feels like. It’s impossible to imagine living for so many years, right?

Let me tell you that it DOES get better. 

Fight it. Fight it with every nerve in your body. Not the feeling that you wanna die, but the depression. Fight it hard on most days and on some days let it loose. Take your medicines, see your therapist consistently. If possible, *if possible* exercise for 30 mins every day. Don’t beat yourself up if you can’t.

Some day it will get easier and you’ll start imagining what your future would look like. That time, know that you have solved one piece of the puzzle. 

I still am depressed, but now I am curious to see what my future would look like. How would it turn out for me? And now I’m curious for yours too. 

Cheers, bud. x"

Can you get any medical exemption from your school? 
I think every school should help out students like us. The fact is, we are different than the rest of them who are healthy. 
Don’t beat yourself up too much though. It’s not worth it. Keep reminding yourself that it’s not your fault that this happened to you. You didn’t choose it. Focus on completing the assignments rather than perfecting them. Trust me, I have tried it."

Friendship is so similar to dating I can’t tell you. 
There might be a lot of females around you who you admire. What you gotta do is ask them out. For hangouts. 

Don’t be afraid of rejection and put yourself out there. 

Share. Females really feel the friendship when they can talk about stuff that bothers them or stuff that makes them happy. Bonus topic- guy problems. They always are a good topic to bond on. Lol

Talk about things you like that you have in common. 

Don’t be shy to invite them again. 

All the very best.
