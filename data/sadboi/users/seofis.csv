adultsurvivors,eqejvbi,t1_eqb8s7t,1560004947.0,"> I think the thing that stands out to me is that it didn't take me by surprise - it was like these memories had always been there

Just wanted to reply to say this is exactly how my memories ""resurfaced,"" they had always been there, but I couldn't deal with them consciously."
ptsd,eqa6wu5,t3_bxw8vi,1559926552.0,I'm proud of you! Congratulations!
relationship_advice,eos4epi,t3_bsknfn,1558817471.0,"This happened to me. I graduated first in my class, they asked me to speak. Family told me they weren't coming. Not a single person in my family showed up or recognized it in any way. I didn't walk or speak, I sat in the audience. 

I genuinely had nightmares about not graduating high school for years afterward. When I confronted my mother about it last year she said, 'that happened ages ago, why are you bringing it up now?' We don't talk anymore."
CPTSD,eods9zs,t3_brc526,1558479844.0,"I am very sorry you're dealing with this. I believe you.

I went through this for years, even though my memory wasn't missing, it was just repressed. By repressed I mean, my body had a memory of what had happened, a clear physical sensation and visualization, but my consciousness *could not deal* with the reality, and pushed it down until I had done years and years of EMDR therapy. When it entered my consciousness again, it was telling me 'you need to deal with this now, stop running from it.' I had a full-blown panic attack afterward. It was horrible, and I still haven't processed it fully. I'm building myself up in other ways and making sure I'm in a safe place before I confront it completely. It has literally always been with me, just underneath the surface because I was too weak to think about it clearly and accept it.

My symptoms are very similar to yours: compulsive masturbation (in front of family and teachers, my school even sent me to an art counselor), fantasies of rape, nightmares (vivid, disturbing, traumatizing nightmares), early puberty, and vaginal infections. I didn't enter into an intimate relationship until I was 27 and the thought of sex would send me into a rage. I thought I was asexual; I'm not, just traumatized.

I believe we can get through this. My best wishes to you on your journey through recovery."
adultsurvivors,eo9k0yv,t3_br1l67,1558393235.0,"I will not be able to answer all of your questions. I would recommend, despite you not seeing the benefit, that you seek out a therapist who specializes in interpersonal family dynamics and/or trauma. They will hopefully be able to help you relieve some of the burden from this disturbing incident.

From my point of view, yes this is sexually abusive. They involved YOU in their sexual thrill, YOU were a part of the experience, YOU ""participated"" without consent, YOU were abused. My mother was never overtly sexually abusive, but she parentified me and committed emotional incest, and she involved me in her phone sex sessions with her boyfriend by sitting next to me during and I could hear the whole thing. **That is a part of it**, otherwise they would seek out privacy. Of all the times and places to commit exhibitionism, she chose when she was in the car with YOU, her child, while you were unable to escape. Doing this is entitled, she believes you have no agency to say yes or no to her whims and desires. That is unhealthy and disgusting. 

You have a gut instinct, you have an intuition, and it's real and strong. You have a right to your feelings. What you're feeling is real and valid.

And lastly, from first hand experience of confronting an abuser, don't do it unless you're completely safe and removed from their influence. From what you described, it sounds like she won't take responsibility and I don't want you to get hurt further. Please take care of yourself."
