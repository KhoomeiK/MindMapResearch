If you want to try the drops, apply them with a brush using a stippling motion. (I use the very popular double-ended i.t. Cosmetics brush. It’s so soft.) When it settles down and dries, you won’t even be able to tell that you have makeup on, and the redness will be gone."

AsianBeauty,fqoy60z,t3_gjng0o,1589528497.0,"I have super sensitive, dry skin, and when I compromised my skin barrier by over-exfoliation and tretinoin, I used:

water to cleanse (or sometimes the Simple cleansing gel in the green tube), Missha essence (three applications in a row), a soothing aloe vera face mask, Soon Jung 2x Barrier Cream, and a very thin layer of Aquaphor just on the places that were peeling. 

That was my routine for months until I was completely healed. 

After that I slowly started incorporating (one at a time with 2-3 weeks in between) a squalane oil just before the barrier cream, a rose water toner, and a gentle oatmeal scrub once every few days. After getting used to that routine, I added a BHA once a week and steadily increased it to 3x per week. 

I hardly ever do the aloe masks anymore unless I’m just wanting to feel decadent. My skin is now AWESOME SAUCE. 😊"
