psychologystudents,fpr7uvu,t3_gez5ur,1588845580.0,"Hello dear colleague!  I am not entirely informed about it but I advise you to inquire about the French philosopher Focault, he wrote a lot about the capitalist system and was interested in health psychology. Then you should do some research on Jacques Lacan, he attributed to Karl Marx the understanding of alienation  of man earlier than Freud did (Marx was a pupil of Hegel, well known by Lacan).  I am Italian, so maybe you may be interested in the reforms on Italian asylums implemented following the theories of Franco Basaglia, Italian psychiatrist who founded Democratic Psychiatry, according to which psychic discomfort is caused by the social marginalization of the mentally ill in our consumer society  You may also inquire about Wilhelm Reich, a communist psychoanalyst, but unfortunately his work is scientifically questionable.  Finally you could read something about Jung, he wrote a book called ""The modern man in search of a soul"". I hope I have helped you!"

psychologystudents,fogmx39,t3_g7b2q2,1587754608.0,"I recommend the first volume of Jung's Collected Works, ""Psychiatric Studies"" (I am in Italy, and the first volume is called that), because I think it is very fascinating to observe how Jung begins to develop his method during his first experiences.  If you are interested in personality and its pathologies, I suggest you read Kohut, his work on narcissistic personality disorder is very interesting, and is articulated during childhood development and the first parental experiences.Klein and Winnicot already know them so it is fine.  I hope I have helped you!"

As for what you asked me: the girl I dream of really exists, but we have never had a relationship, but obviously she has awakened something in me that leads me to dream her, but in many other dreams the girl I love is not this one here  , but it is completely imaginary, but this imaginary girl who reappears is always the same, therefore I have come to the conclusion that the girl I know in reality appears when the dream is less ""deep"", since the dream uses a  real memory, while when I dream the imaginary girl the dream is much deeper, to the point of seeing my ""Anima"" as it really is, without needing to give it the real appearance.  When I wake up I am almost always slightly depressed."

Jung,fgfqxlr,t3_ey8qqw,1580745596.0,"The fear of death is legitimate, but you can only accept it if you fully understand the value of life, if you are afraid of dying, perhaps it is because you feel you are not really living.  Jung says that the psyche is structured to accept the passage of time and the arrival of death, if your soul cannot accept it, however, it is probably because you feel that you still have to do something.  Find yourself, get closer to the Self and feed your life and your psyche with what reminds you who you are and what you love, but first of all you have to accept yourself; you are a mortal, time is against you, but not  it is the time you have to live to be important, but what you still have to discover about yourself."

I have suffered from OCD since I was 8-9 years old, then delusions and paranoia started from 14 years, I was tired and lacking in energy, then after high school, after the first year of university I started doing psychoanalysis and I am improving,  obsessive thoughts have almost disappeared and delusions are manageable.  The only thing that doesn't go away is obsessive reading, if I read I consume a lot of energy because I read the same things several times and it takes hours for a few pages.  But I resist because I know that I can improve, surely you can do it too brother, I was very bad but now I feel hope."

psychologystudents,feutgb2,t3_eqmvd1,1579389708.0,"Serial killers are not necessarily psychopaths, serial murder has a wide range of motives.  Psychopathy is characterized by a serious lack of empathy and difficulty in perceiving their emotions, the personality of these patients is severely disrupted, although apparently they seem self-aware, just this can push to kill.  Example: some cannibal serial killers unconsciously perceive a serious emotional lack and a sense of inner emptiness, when another human being provokes some emotional process in them, these patients not being able to metabolize the attraction they feel towards the future victim resort to  cannibalism to get in touch with it. The drive to kill is the result of an internal inability of the patient to metabolize and understand impulses and emotions, which are therefore applied in primitive and sometimes violent ways."
