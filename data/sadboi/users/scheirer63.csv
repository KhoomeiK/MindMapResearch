I don't go without a list and I stick to the list. I know what prices are typically like and I can tell when something is more or less expensive than it usually is. If it's not on the list, with some rare exceptions, I'm not buying it.

If my wife goes shopping, there's a list, but she's very impulsive and she'll come home three hours later with a $400 bill and bags full of naturally sprouted organic spaghetti and Croatian racing salt.

So I do the shopping."

The reality is there's no privacy at all, 99.9% of what I hear has nothing to do with my project, and 90% of *that* has nothing to do with work.

Bert is kind of a goofball who approaches life on his own terms and wanted to befriend Ken and wouldn't take no for an answer. Now they're inseparable and Ken has let his guard down enough that the other cats accept him.

Bert can be a bit much for the other three cats, but Kenny always finds room for him.

Likely because he was used to having to fight for everything while on the streets, so he was friendly with us but there was constant tension with the other cats.

Then we adopted Bert. Bert's an orange dork who doesn't really care what anyone thinks. Kenny tried to be standoffish with him, too but Bert just kind of wouldn't give up until they were friends.

I remember hearing a commotion at about 2:30 one morning and it was Bert and Kenny playing, rolling around and chasing each other through the house. I cried.

Bert got through to Kenny and changed his life. Showed him how to be a cat again, pretty much."

The idea is that it's a collaborative space. If we're all working on the same project, then we all absorb, though I guess some kind of osmosis, more information on the project.

Trouble is, purchasing and documentation is in a row about 10m away from me. Always on the phone and otherwise always in conversation.

Other engineering disciplines are right over a 1.5m wall. There's a busy conference room 10m on the other side. I hear everything. 99.9% of what I hear has nothing to do with my project, and 90% of that has nothing to do with work at all.

There's a guy who sniffs. I've counted. About 5 sniffs per minute all day every day for years.

There's a guy with an obscene barking cough every two or three minutes. He's new, but it's been going on for months.

There are other people in close proximity who don't seem to notice any of this AT ALL! How is that possible. It makes me feel like an over sensitive freak.

I hear every conversation from everyone everywhere. I wear headphones with noise cancelling AND earplugs but stuff still gets through.

I'd love to speak up, but I feel like doing so would endanger my livelihood. I have under ten years to retirement but I don't know if I can make it.

Dogs barking, brushing teeth, certain frequencies in people's voices, a particular kind of breathing... conversations in general. Sniffing. It just sends me into a blind rage.

I read this somewhere before but I really think I'd rather be deaf."
