AskReddit,faz01kk,t3_earnak,1576409638.0,"I was visiting my mom a few years back and the next day I got a text from my ex saying that her current girlfriend saw me walking down their street. Turns out she still lives in the same town, with a girlfriend she is not happy with. They have been together for years. I was the first girl she fell in love with (and vice versa) but she was in a relationship with a guy back then. She left him shortly to be with me, but chickened out, stayed in the closet and went back to him for a little while. Then she met her current GF and they are still together. She has bumped into me a few times over the years but she was always scared to say hi. It's weird to think about it, we would have never worked out."

CPTSD,f1txwfj,t3_dalrkt,1569751760.0,"I agree with you and thank you for reminding me of this! I remember seeing some VHS footage of myself when I was like 4 years old a while ago and it just struck me that I was going through some stuff at that point in my life already and that in that particular video I was so pure and not aware of what was to happen in my future. I started crying and I realized it was because I loved myself. I may not be able to fully love myself in the present, but if I was capable of feeling such grief and such love for myself at that age, then there must be some love for myself in the present as well after all."

Thetruthishere,exmngtd,t1_exmmjjl,1566435880.0,"""it almost feels like they can see you too."" I FEEL THIS SO DEEPLY. 

A few days ago I was walking my dog and I saw some flying object with mainly red lights surrounded by tiny ""stars"" that appeared to be dancing around this object. I thought it was just my eye making it up but I could still see this while the object was flying behind a set of electricity cables (there is a transmission tower in front of my house and I was walking past this) There was another flying object that moved similar to the red object, it looked farther away but this one was also surrounded by these stars. These two moving objects were most likely planes since there is an airports just a few miles away but the ""stars""....? Craaaazy stuff"
Thetruthishere,exmkcv1,t3_ctotia,1566433762.0,"Dude the moving stars, I've had a similar experience about 10 years ago! Me, my ex and family in law were driving to Disneyland Paris. It was the middle of the night and I was just staring out of the window when three somewhat perfectly aligned stars caught my eye. Then a fourth star appeared perfectly aligned with these three as well and I was absolutely bummed by this already. Then this fourth star started moving, it looked like it was dancing all over the sky. I think this lasted for about two minutes and then it disappeared. Up until this day I keep looking for these three magical stars thinking back to the wondrous dance I had witnessed back then. Awesome to see that you experienced something similar."

AskReddit,eptciu0,t3_bvy44x,1559487258.0,"I was born in Greece but moved to The Netherlands when I was 9 years old. I have family in both countries. A few years after having moved here, my father died. His passing and financial problems were two of the main reasons why I had not and was not able to visit my family in Greece anytime soon. Eight years after moving I managed to win a contest and the prize was a month of free traveling by train in Europe, which I used to finally visit my home country again, so I could reunite with my family and visit my dad's grave as well. This was without a doubt the coolest and best thing to happen to me ever."
CPTSD,eo9c5b9,t3_br1jft,1558387725.0,"I can relate and it depends. What is helpful to me is questioning what I am doing, why I do it and what value it has to my present. Things tend to be more difficult for me as soon as I get involved with my past or my future too much. It is good to reflect on past choices and your past-self, it's necessary to look at your future and the things you aspire, but in the end all that matters is the present. And the way you choose to live and feel and see and grow. 

Good luck to you :)"

ptsd,eo8xefy,t3_bqvkam,1558377000.0,"Have you ever looked into exposure therapy? 

I finished PTSD treatment three months ago and about 80% of the symptoms have been cleared. I have been triggered a few times after my return and it was weird to experience this after treatment because I was able to cope a lot better. What helped me is not trying to avoid it. Clearly your mind is telling you something. In these moments it is very important to ground yourself. Yes this is extremely difficult to do because of many reasons, one being you are used to the PTSD taking over your entire life. So work on breaking these patterns. You are stronger than you think! 

Ground yourself by meditating or doing breathing exercises. And don't just do these when the flashbacks kick in, make a habit out of it. Take some moments to breathe throughout the entire day. Wake up breathing consciously and breathe yourself to sleep. Also find some of these moments in between. As soon as it becomes a habit, it will be easier for you to activate this coping mechanism and reprogram your own mind. 

Adding affirmations might help as well. You are safe. You are okay. You are strong. Say these things to yourself when the flashback kicks in and while you are breathing yourself to the present again. Because you are safe, you deserve to feel okay and you are strong because you can and will overcome your fears. 

I wish you the best of luck, you got this!"
hsp,eo8v5rb,t1_eo8bfsu,1558375529.0,"Well I think it's important to acknowledge all that we feel. Feeling lonely is just as valuable and just as much of a privilege as feeling happy. It is just scary to feel lonely, because happiness is something we really want to share with other people, something we want to give back to other people, whereas loneliness is something we tend to keep to ourselves. But there is so much power in feeling disconnected, lost, lonely. Just take a moment to think about the ways in which we can transform something as intangible as loneliness into something that is tangible, be it by creating a work of art, finding a song that resonates with our vibration and so on. How beautiful is that?

How would I know what it means to feel one with everything, without having experienced what it's like to fell lonely? We need this experience. It is human and it is so beautifully pure.

I'd like to suggest reading into the principles of yin-yang and its concept of dualism.

Thank you for showing interest, I hope you are well! :)"
hsp,eo87ju2,t3_bqtuva,1558359563.0,"I can relate to this so much! What helps me is considering this loneliness as a gift, it's good to feel lonely sometimes. I for one need to feel this in order to be able to connect to people on a deeper level. Questioning the loneliness and where it truly comes from shines a different light on it now."
