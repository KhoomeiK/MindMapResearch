Solo queue tank is so frustrating at times. I go Hammond- get bitched at. I go dva and other tank doesn't go barrier tank. So I feel obligated to go Sigma or Orisa- I suck as Rein.

I was support main and it is so much easier to solo queue as. I feel as a tank if I make a mistake it can cause us to lose a fight."

With technology advancing every single day. Do you think they won't have a problem replacing you. It's been happening for decades. There won't be entry jobs left. Do you think McDonald's will have an issue replacing humans with Automated machines? Hospitals are being closed all the time.

But really, just use reload time to reposition. People don't realize that a Ashe with a pocket mercy can deal 450 dmg if you hit a dynamite and a head shot.

You can argue Hammond as well, but people complain when anyone goes him. This has just shown, mind you I am a tank and support main, that DPS is by far the least impactful role. Take away the two best supports in the game and one of only two main tanks and it shows a tanks mistake is ten times worse than a DPS mistake. And without heals the DPS just get shredded.

Now I just wait to see what my other tank picks like 50% but no matter what they pick I don't always pick rein. Sometimes I do.

I literally have un-fun and get a damn migraine from solo queue Rein 99% of the time. I just decided to basically just starting to say ""fuck it"" the silver-plat range meta doesn't matter much. The off tanks atm can easily carry. Especially dva and Zarya. Hell if you can play Hammond he is a carry monster at least till Mei comes back. At most I'll go sig. I've carried games on each. Don't get me wrong not all games you can carry. But I just worry what I can do and focus on what my job is. If you worry about the others you make more mistakes and can start tilting way easier.

SymmetraMains,fjeioc7,t1_fjc6p4b,1583272402.0,Maybe make it the turret can be put onto an ally? And it gives them...a slow heal? Or shields? And a turret on an ally last only so long? I would love her to just not be a cheese bot. But that's just me I understand some of y'all like be her play style. But I just think it could be so much more interesting with her back story.
SymmetraMains,fjei7g2,t1_fjd085i,1583272143.0,"True. She would need a complete rework. If she is gonna be so niche as a dps, they should go all the way. Her teleport is like Mei wall, no other dps has anything like it. They should just make it to where her teleporter is immediately placed but only one team mate can go threw. Though basically reaper has that.... Idk maybe turrets can slowly recharge your tanks barrier? But that makes her and rein too strong. At the least her teleporter should drop almost immediately so she can use it in a fight. I mean it's used just for cheese and helping your team get back from spawn quicker. Idk just throwing ideas out there."
SymmetraMains,fjcgbfi,t1_fjcb1bs,1583218994.0,But she isn't. She is completely defensive and close range. With no escape. Her Tele port takes too long to use in a fight. Scope?

SymmetraMains,fjbn4mu,t1_fjbk31t,1583197053.0,Yeah. It's just sad that I know she's be a much better tank or support than where she is. Maybe that's just my opinion. At the very least give her 50 more shields.
