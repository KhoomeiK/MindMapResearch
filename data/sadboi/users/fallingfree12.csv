Maaaaybe I shouldn't have been texting like crazy, but also maybe you could wait till you stopped driving to read and answer the texts? 

And I couldn't even call him because that phone was technically his dad's (His actual phone didn't work anymore unless it was on Wifi and you couldn't call it, it was disconnected) and if you called it, it would go right to his dad's other phone.

It ruins you) and seriously the day after that fight I saw he kept visiting this girl's Facebook page and I started snooping from there... Just horrible. The insecurity that these kinds of relationships brings out in you is awful, it's so embarrassing and beneath you and what's worse, you really can't stop. I couldn't. I spent hours on his computer going deeper, I read text messages, just awful awful things that I never usually do or never want to do again. Man. I do NOT miss that shit. I'm telling you & I'm promising you, it does get better, and you deserve someone that you can trust and don't feel this way about. I always had a weird feeling about him. He always said it killed him that I couldn't trust him, and he held it over me. He'd start to cry while telling me, pull out all of those cards, and I'd feel so fucking terrible and think it was really all me. It's not. Trust your intuition. Even if they're not cheating on you, physically or emotionally, there's a reason you don't feel secure in the relationship and why you're doing this impulsively now. They're toxic and not healthy. It's not right. I'm still addicted to some parts of the drug--I still type in his name without even thinking twice when I open a search engine, when I go onto social media, etc. I don't even mean to or want to it's literally like automatic for me at this point. I need to get over that and I will & I know I'm not 100% NC yet because of this, but I haven't talked to him since the end of last year and I haven't seen him in even longer at this point so I count that as a win for me. It is tough and it takes work even a little after--I see you were in a two and a half year relationship, I was in a two year one--but you will heal and stop impulsively doing this. I promise. I totally get it though, I knew names of girls he wanted to be with right after, I knew what they looked like, I'd see his phone when she texted him, just awful. Also, you are totally doing the right thing moving back in with your parents. I didn't do this and I would tell everyone, now that I'm in hindsight, to move out ASAP.

The best thing to do is stop asking yourself, stop wondering, and try to just move on. So hard but it does get easier with time and NC. NC was so incredibly hard for me at first and it literally took months but now it's a no brainer and I never want to talk to him or see him ever again.

Oh man. I've been a longtime lurker of Reddit in general for a while now--never posting, never having an account, just reading--and I discovered this thread last year when I was going through all of this shit with my ex and it seriously saved my life. I can't express enough how validating it is to read in black and white all of these posts, all of these comments. These people truly make you believe that it's you, that you're the crazy one, and to see other people share and vent and read their stories, it's like you're able to breathe again. I've read posts on here that have made me actually gasp out loud because I can relate and I have been there. It's extremely powerful and liberating. You're made to feel so bad for so long and sometimes you find some relief just when you need it... Thank you everyone for sharing your words and your personal experiences. Means a lot and it's so important. Last year was one of the worst of my life, I already suffer from bad anxiety and depression (Which of course my Narc Ex knows) and the spot I was in last summer was an all time low for me. I felt an awfulness I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. The fact that I stayed in an abusive relationship long enough to get discarded, that I couldn't even leave because I loved him & believed in him and truly really thought that he would CHANGE... I just feel so sorry for my past self and I want to hug her. I want to hug all of you. No one deserves this kind of treatment & we should all be with people that make us happy. The fact that someone could make me hate myself more than I already do is one of the worst weapons that anyone could hold, and my ex held just that and he knew it too. Besos to you all and stay strong. It does get better. A little over a year of him breaking up with me and NC since the New Year... we've all got this."
