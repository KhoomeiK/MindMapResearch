LesbianActually,f8geoqx,t3_e0ida5,1574558517.0,@the_holistic_psychologist on Instagram! She posts about a ton of books that have helped her through identity and other issues of the sorts. I found her work extremely eye opening and helpful

They see your face rather than a faceless application on a computer and sometimes that can do a lot!!"
AmItheAsshole,f02z6j0,t3_d395xb,1568341144.0,NTA. I‚Äôm from a military family and my birthday is 9/11 I was born in the 90s. We usually talk about my birthday but out of respect for the military ppl (something that we just kinda started doing also without talking about it) they would say happy birthday but we‚Äôd wait to celebrate or celebrate the week before as a combined bday with my younger brother (bday 9/05). It was strange and eventually I asked about it and I then understood but then totally ignoring would have been straight up insane they can‚Äôt just associate you with such a terrible thing.

by any means!!!!! You should always put your hormones and body first. I understand he is your husband, and you have to have these conversations, but you told him as soon as you could! If you are trying to get pregnant you wouldn‚Äôt have told him any of this and if he or is family is too crazy to believe that then that‚Äôs messed up! You deserve to make the choices about your body, especially if the hormones were causing you harm. I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal with this"

depression,ewyjbl1,t3_cqqe91,1565882050.0,Congrats! I needed to take a break and I didn‚Äôt and it made finishing classes a lot more challenging and caused some other bad coping habits as well. I‚Äôm glad I finally learned that it‚Äôs ok to stop when needed and start again! Go you!

First, total bull shit for someone to ask you to be in a wedding and then complain ab your body or what is on it. They did not have to ask... 
Second, anyone who actually gives a shit about them won‚Äôt care what else is going on (though a tattoo should be the least of anyone‚Äôs issues)"

They were letting us know right there that what we were listening to was useless, yet we would be tested!!! I am the kind of person who zones out if info is not relevant to me. If I would have learned some emotional education I doubt I would have so much anxiety, and poor coping mechanisms for strong emotions. My 12 year old sister seems to be experiencing some of these emotional issues earlier than I, as our parents are divorcing, our mom acting like a teen herself, having some emotional stability in school would be phenomenal for her"
