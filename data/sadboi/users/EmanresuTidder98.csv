I have about 20 succulents im trying to sprout. The planters may hold about 2... thats what i mean when i say they wont really be in use.
relationship_advice,fn6pq20,t1_fn6p6q2,1586704839.0,"I am grateful that he got me a gift. Im sad that i cant use any of what he got me. I've talked to him about this before and stated its okay to ask me if i would use it so we dont have random objects in the house to ""look cool"" but are actually just taking space and being unused. Ive talked to him before about not being okay with him ordering me random things from amazon because i dont want to support them but he did it anyway. His family is used to doing this and buying eachother things that they themselves enjoy but are not necessarily for the person that they are buying the gift for. He tends to buy things more that he would enjoy than things for me (the poster, the burner, etc), whats the point in getting the gift then?"
relationship_advice,fn6o1wo,t1_fn6nx37,1586703818.0,Thank you! This was very helpful. I hate being wasteful and having him waste money on things i know i wont use... i appreciate the thought but i know I'll feel like shit when he comes home with them sitting in a corner being unused every day...
BPD,fht4u7s,t3_f4kkgj,1581870121.0,"I havent given up yet. I lost every friend i was close to either from their betrayal or my own. Im trying to learn what it takes to have normal relationship with regular people so I can develop my emotional needs to suit it. At the moment i have one real friend (not counting my husband), and shes very patient, kind, and understanding. We only talk a few times a week but im happy fo have her. I know very few people in this world may show you that, but the ones who do are worth finding and they can help you grow and lead you to more. The ""befriend course"" from improvement pill on youtube has helped me a lot with understanding how regular functional relationships work, building them, and how i can improve the ones i have. Its a balance of understanding yourself and  how to cope as well as utilizing and upholding a support system without abusing others emotional wellbeing. It is a lot of time to learn and work through but every moment has improved my life as it is now. Learn what you need to heal yourself from first. 

TLDR learn to cope so others arent overwhelmed, take "" the befriend course"" on YT. You can have healthy friendships, just takes time."

socialskills,ewidc1s,t3_cod2w2,1565446422.0,"Its okay to feel hurt, they weren't treating you well. Make sure you cope with that feeling and move on. They are not worth your time and if he didn't want your company then its his loss! Next time tell the girl he's trying to cheat on his Gf and you just go find something cool to do for you. You put yourself through more than enough in that situation, you dont have to deal with nonsense like that."

socialskills,ewibd5v,t3_cogjqv,1565444799.0,"You have to figure out what makes you so uncomfortable about those situations and ease yourself into them. People are not horrible, and worst things that you think might happen most likely arent. Learn about yourself and those fears to make it easier to combat them. Ease yourself into going out more with the people you do trust, even if its just family. get used to regular conversation again by trying every day, its okay to look up tips! Push yourself to talk to someone different you might have something in common with. Basic conversation skills can be learned, and with practice you can become comfortable in those environments even if the situation doesn't go as planned. Awkward things can be laughed off, and maybe they couldn't hear you before. Start off small, give a stranger a compliment, talk about the weather with a classmate, etc.. You can learn to cope with that feeling and move forward  What matters is whether or not youre willing to keep trying again after you get scared. Dont be scared to be yourself either! The right people will be interested in what you have to say, and you might just make a new friend that way. Regardless though, take your time and learn about yourself, you want progressive, productive learning and the quality of this will help you for a lifetime, dont focus on going to all the parties or getting a bf. Focus on meeting people who make you feel good, and making memories with them. Those friendships are worth more."

depression_help,epnshrg,t3_bv9o6b,1559332558.0,"Dude, you gotta stop drinking. Its killing your brain cells and making you feel worse every day that you do. If anything I'd recommend smoking weed again. Weed is the only reason im alive today (ive scarcely had access to therapy, meds, etc). But regardless, you have to be willing to change your mindset and learn how to be happy again. You have to look within yourself and figure out what is making you feel like life is no longer worth living; whats truly hurting you. I don't think you want to die, i just think you want to stop feeling pain and I loneliness. I also feel like you might be using the alcohol to avoid whats making you feel so terrible. Thats why i use weed, it relaxes my body and mind so im not panicking and if i take the time to truly think about the feelings im dealing with right then, feel them, and sort it out, i feel better afterwards and should it come back i can cope a little better. When you start to spiral into a bad place try to find coping mechanisms that can pull you back to reality. Try to find yourself again and remember what used to make you happy, but you have to keep trying every day, even the hardest ones (and should a hard day come just post your thoughts here!). Every day just continue trying to learn about yourself and continue thinking about what you really want (happiness, success, friends, a girl,etc). If you keep that mindset and try every day it will push you to places you wouldnt imagine. Do not be afraid of yourself, learn to love and care for yourself, right now you need to nurturing and I know you can try."

Ive only gotten through that part of the book so far but it gives a lot of options for coping.

This is a great opportunity. If you have a job or go to school try to make small conversation with people or even just try to respond to posts and talk like that (you can look up how to online if it helps, its helped me a ton). Value your opinion and see it as a valuable piece of a discussion and try to face your fear and tackle the strong emotions or triggers you may feel. It gets easier I promise."
