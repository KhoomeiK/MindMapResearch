unimelb,fpcsjva,t3_gc3ux7,1588511498.0,"I did Australia in the wine world and would 100% recommend it! It wasn't exactly easy but was such a fun and interesting week. Since I was staying at the Dookie campus with everyone else taking it the whole time, I found it was pretty easy to keep on top of the content for the assessment tasks and the exam at the end of the week as everyone else was in the same boat."

In my opinion, it is pretty easy but equally pretty dull."
unimelb,fpcirzz,t1_fpc4c9r,1588502079.0,"Agreed! The year I did it we were assigned a natural disaster to work on for the entire semester... my group got bushfires, which maybe some people are about but not me. 

The in-class assignments were mostly related to management (i.e. tropical cyclone evacuation plans), whereas I was under the impression we'd be learning about the science/history behind them when I enrolled. Regardless, I got a pretty good mark but I feel like I didn't really learn anything."

BPD,fo9jnla,t3_g6c7tj,1587621454.0,"Without giving too much detail, I've been in a super similar boat before when I was a child... now I tend to doubt the majority of my memories that involve abuse and have a real hard time believing people take me seriously. 

I hiiighly doubt you'd make up the abuse you described. As has been stated here already and was the case in my experience, your family is most likely denying it out of shame and fear of getting your father in trouble."

BPD,fo7lm4m,t1_fo7k86h,1587580427.0,I'd believe this for sure.
BPD,fo7g9w8,t1_fo7f19y,1587577828.0,Favourite person... A person alot of people with BPD have in their lives who they tend to attach themselves to. In my case (and alot of others) it's usually the person I'm crushing/obsessing on or seeing/dating.
BPD,fo78oko,t3_g61u5j,1587574151.0,"Yes 1000%. The main driving factor of most of my emotional breakdowns seem to be related to a fear of abandonment from my FP. The longest I've been single or not crushing on someone for the past 10 years has been a couple of months, and even though I'd tend to party and sleep around a fair bit, I'm genuinely happy with myself in those times. When I started developing feelings for the person I'm currently seeing, I hated it so much since I knew a whole lot of negative emotions fed by my intense abandonment issues were going to eventually come along.. but even with this knowledge it never ever stops me. Once I get the feels, I get them baaad and I love it and I hate it all at the same time. 

The level of happiness I feel when I don't have a FP, although stable and continuous, doesn't seem to compare at all to the joy I feel when I'm feeling good about where I'm at with a FP. I guess I'm a major fiend for external validation. It also makes me feel super sad that I am this way and I really hope I can learn not to be."

BPD,fn53fgh,t3_fzmdz4,1586654998.0,"I dated an addict for 1.5 years, so understand what you're saying to an extent. He would constantly turn to it when I couldn't hang out with him and left him alone, and would verbally and (sometimes) physically abuse me if I ever brought up that I think he had a problem. I would justify this behaviour that it was the drugs, and not him, that was doing it, and if I could somehow wait it out with him things would get better. I would forgive him sooo much and started losing so much self respect. The times we would get wasted/high together felt like amazing bonding experiences at the time but I really wouldn't recommend it... he just used these times as counterarguments whenever I tried to help him.

I know you mentioned he's not a bad guy, so the abusive side of my story isn't necessarily relatable, but investing so much time in an addict (especially if you have a mental/personality disorder) is never going to help you. It's such a shitty situation and I feel for you. Whatever you do good luck and know you're not alone."
BPD,fn50mel,t3_fyyeju,1586653137.0,"I don't necessarily delete social media, but I'll mute group chats and ignore people for ages. This happens usually after I hang out with someone or a group of people, drinking/drugs most likely involved and I will 99% do something that I'm inTENSely embarrassed of (e.g. spilling too much personal info about myself, impulsively sleeping with someone/cheating with someone in the group, being too loud or annoying). I'll usually ignore said person/people for at least a month before I think they might have forgotten about anything I've done and I feel as though I've got some sort of a fresh slate in those relationships... definitely not for attention (I don't think?) but sabotaging nonetheless I'm sure. Would be great if I just didn't act the way I did and maybe wouldn't have to do this in the first place."
BPD,fmu23ze,t1_fmtf2mj,1586383144.0,"Yes thanks so much for sharing. I also believe I was misdiagnosed a lot of the time; I don't even think it was ever considered by any of my psychs until I attempted suicide, which was due to me being in an abusive relationship with a meth addict. I sometimes think that people who I tell about that relationship as well as my diagnosis think that I was the reason it got so bad.. especially after reading anecdotes where people label basically everyone with BPD as bad, manipulative people who aren't capable or even deserving of true happiness. The stigma is way too real. I hope that clinic helps you!"
BPD,flfqsmi,t3_fob7an,1585114489.0,"Ugh yes 100%. I do this on how I view myself WAY more than how I see other people, which is so contrary (in my experience) to what most people think BPD is about."
BPD,fl8fa94,t1_fl8d47d,1584922352.0,Oh yeah I have never heard of it! I recently changed to Pritiq (4th antidepressant I've tried) and am finding it's lifting my mood and energy (not to mention i can orgasm now) but ive noticed a substantial increase in anxiety and sleeplessness. I might ask my GP about other options. Unfortunately she has been quite hesitant about prescribing sedatives to me but I guess it's worth a shot if it could potentially help me.
BPD,fl8bq8c,t1_fl89i0y,1584920083.0,"It varies a bit! I'd say I'll black out to some extent from drinking on average once every 1.5-2 weeks. I definitely get that shame and sadness you mention, and unfortunately that feeling more often that not drives me to drink again that day/night (especially if I'm alone). 

I actually haven't really mentioned my struggles with alcohol to my GP, so I might give that a go! Can I ask what antidepressant you are on? I wish I could try using weed but unfortunately makes me incrediblyyy anxious."

EatingDisorders,f2ig0wj,t3_ddah7f,1570256709.0,"The very first person I told about my bulimia was my boyfriend at the time, who I had been dating for 4 years at the time. His reaction was far from ideal, which delayed me telling anyone else about it for a while. Probably a year later I opened up about it to my sister, who got me to go into therapy. Ever since me and that boy broke up, I've been nothing but open about my ED, which has been extremely beneficial and have found so many others in my life who have gone through similar things. It may seem shameful at the moment, but it's insane how common it is and how many people in my life know or who are people who have the same struggles. I don't know about the people in your life but I didn't know about them either in mine until I started talking about it, and it's been so so helpful having them around when things go bad."
unimelb,f2iauoa,t3_dbporh,1570254625.0,Does this include maths subjects? I found graph theory way easier than any math subjects and it's pretty interesting especially if you're into comp stuff. Think you need to have done real analysis though
BPD,exnlvly,t1_exn6znl,1566459090.0,"I definitely have self-esteem issues and it sucks I haven't been able to find a psych who I don't have this problem with... It's definitely on me because logically I know 99.99% of the time a psych I've paid for will have my best interests at heart and won't undermine me. Just wish I could get over it so I can seriously benefit from my sessions with them. 

And yes yes yes to those two reactions. It's nice knowing other people feel the same as I do in certain situations. Every time I speak up in class, every reaction I get, from facial expressions to verbal responses, or lack of, I'll always take that as them thinking I'm talking smack and have no idea what I'm on about. Even though I'm in my final year of a master of eng, and I've worked soooo hard, I'll still second guess everything I've had to say out loud related to my course."
