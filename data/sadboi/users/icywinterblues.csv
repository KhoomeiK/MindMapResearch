as a vegetarian ex-waitress who used to work at a Japanese ramen restaurant, she's wrong, there is such a thing as Japanese vegan ramen. Sure ramen is traditionally pork, chicken, or seafood based, but vegan ramen do exist and there are a lot of veg*an-friendly ramen restaurants in Japan nowadays.

The minimum wage in San Francisco is already at the national proposed wage of $15/hr, which is about the same amount that people working in entry-level data entry jobs make, and that's still far not enough to live there. The issue isn't minimum wage, it's that the cost of living keeps going up every year and minimum wage simply can't keep up. You could raise the minimum wage to $20/hr but then your average rent for a studio would be around $5k a month (current prices for a 1 bedroom in SF is already around $3-4k). I don't know how much a studio or 1 bedroom apartment costs in Australia where their minimum wage is ~$17/hr, but $4-5k for a studio/1 bedroom when you're making $15/hr in places like SF is absolutely ridiculous."
