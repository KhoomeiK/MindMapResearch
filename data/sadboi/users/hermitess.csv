migraine,fk36ap2,t3_ep9fhc,1583819276.0,"After trying 30+ medications with no success,  I was finally approved for Botox.

Botox took a while to start working,  but after my second injection (3 months after the first) my migraines reduced from 30 days a month to 15. I did start amitriptyline (a last resort for me due to weight gain and skepticism that a tricyclic would solve s problem nothing else could) at the same time as Botox, so the drugs may be at least partly responsible for the improvement, but I know the botox is doing something because when it starts to wear off, my migraines start happening daily again.  The amitryptaline seems to help the severity,  but not the frequency.  I need the botox for that. No side effects to speak of. 

My goal is to return to full-time work,  so even though a reduction from 30 to 15 days a month is great, i fought to try a CGRP as well. My insurance wouldn't pay for both,  but with my neurologist's help,  i was able to get a copay card to try it for a year.  I just injected yesterday,  so I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I have to say I think it's already working because yesterday I had aura and felt like I was going into a week of migraines,  but this morning I woke up with zero pain and had no pain all day despite multiple stressors. Aside from giving myself a panic attack while self-injecting, I have not had any side effects."

AskReddit,fgsq7st,t1_fgs9kxi,1581090310.0,"There are reasons besides wanting to escape dysfunctional families and avoid the cultural stigma of ""still living with your parents"":

-We have a lot of divorce in our country, and step- parents in particular want the kids to leave
-Young people want to have sex with randos they meet on tinder and they don't want the awkwardness of bringing random partners home to meet the folks
- actually,  even if you're seriously dating one person,  its awkward having sex with them knowing your parents are down the hall

I always have painfully dry eyes,  barren nostrils, and a constantly dry mouth.  If anything,  my body doesn't produce enough mucus/moisture. 

And strangely,  it's not the pressure on my eyes that helps.  It's specifically the sensation of pulling them outwards. I haven't been able to find anything on the internet about it because it's hard to find the right words,  but if no one here has experienced it, maybe it's not related to my migraines."

Apparently I grind the f* out of my teeth in my sleep. 

Anyway,  the mouthpiece they recommended didn't work for me. Having an object in my mouth may have protected my teeth but it caused me to have a reflex of clenching my jaw even more,  leading to even more pain. But i hear it works for a lot of people.  Maybe It'll work for you."
