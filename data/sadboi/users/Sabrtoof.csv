decaf,fp09l3p,t3_gafh09,1588205054.0,"I gave up vaping on Easter and I cried my eyes out for an entire day, then I had vivid dreams that night. I hadn‚Äôt had a dream in over 4 months before that. Turns out the nicotine was affecting my pineal gland and melatonin release. Flash forward to six days ago when I quit caffeine. I cried like a little baby again because another one of my my bahbahs had been taken away. The headaches and fatigue have been intense, but I‚Äôm so glad I am doing this while quarantined so I can journal every time a triggering emotion comes up. Journaling has been very therapeutic for me. I heard somewhere that journaling had meditative effects and I believe it. Basically all my emotions had been stuffed or jammed due to chemicals and I was tired of it. I feel a sense of calm and peace now that the caffeine is gone. I am not feeling anxiety, but before all of this I had(and still am) been involved with a 12 step Codependent‚Äôs Anonymous group which helped me sort through my emotions. I just want to throw that out there for anyone else who has received almost immediate emotional relief while still having intense physical symptoms. Also have been doing clean eating which helps the emotions stay in check. Sugar and bread are just as addictive."

schizoaffective,epznyhz,t3_bwqgf0,1559669330.0,My boyfriend and family have been very supportive. If you allow her to speak about her delusions without judgement this will be a great help. Talking about them out loud to someone has helped me to verbalize my thoughts and it makes them seem less real when other people kindly ask why I think them to be true and what supportive evidence I have. Just talking about it thoroughly as if it could be true (meeting her where she is at) and then gently offering evidence that maybe they are not true. I have found that my delusions are caused from the physiological structure of my brain but also because of trauma. See if there is a theme there. Mine has always been around escape and feeling imprisoned. Encourage regular therapy.

schizoaffective,eo9xcru,t3_br3tal,1558402470.0,"I thought this about myself as well. I dated a guy two years and a big reason he wouldn‚Äôt commit is because he was afraid I might become unable to work one day/raise kids or that I couldn‚Äôt survive mentally while getting off of meds and trying to get pregnant. Also, our outlook on life was different. I wanted to exit the world and he wanted to live and enjoy it. Ultimately he realized he loved me and it was worth the risk to live with my mental illness. He respects that I am doing everything my doctors say and am compliant with my meds. We are back together now and making plans for our future. 
Don‚Äôt give up! Keep searching for love. If you are taking care of yourself and don‚Äôt become codependent on someone else, then hopefully a healthy relationship will come."
