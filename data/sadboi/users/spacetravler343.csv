birthcontrol,epp8s0t,t3_bvejr2,1559368793.0,"I love the keeyna. I haven't had any problems yet but maybe a little more bitchyness 🤭. Just mild cramping here and there but it's been getting less and less noticeable. No weight gain, no break outs, no crazy hormones. It's perfect and I would recommend it for everyone honestly! I dont even notice it's there at this point which can be scary but if you are regularly going in for your checkups or checking yourself there really isnt anything to be afraid of. I'm happy with my IUD 😊"
Parenting,epp7xhv,t3_bvfk2d,1559367703.0,Yesterday was tough for me. I'm a stay at home mom and gosh does it get hard sometimes especially being in my early twenties. Sometimes I look forward most to bedtime lol.
birthcontrol,eoeev24,t1_eoeephx,1558494727.0,I'm going to go in and have it checked tomorrow. 😊 but it seems like it might just be ovulation hopefully
gardening,eodpz14,t1_eodntgo,1558478345.0,Once they start getting bigger were going to eliminate some of them so they have more room to grow just waiting to see which ones grow faster 😊
