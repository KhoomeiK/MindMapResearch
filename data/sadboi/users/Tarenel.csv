BPD,fp1k4wz,t3_gaoaxf,1588238266.0,"I think it's so important to differentiate between what we want to so (which sometimes yes I do actively want to or think about actions that are mean or cruel) and what we actually do! Our disorder stops at what we want to do - you can't really control what you think but you can control what you do. I guess the struggle of impulse control is different for everyone (I struggle quite a bit with impulse control around telling people how bad they've made me feel or how sad I am) but it's a burden we all must bear. But you know what - we can do it! Support one another in terms of ""I relate - I feel that way too!"" But not in terms of actually carrying through with that behaviour and supporting it.

I think we all struggle with the guilt of what we have done. And we may do it again, unwittingly or no. But let's not support one anothers hurtful behaviours but recognise and acknowledge the thoughts and emotions and then gently steer toward a healthier response."
southafrica,fnbxevh,t3_g0n2ki,1586824234.0,"I stay in quite a small complex, with some tenants having kids. We have decided to allow people to go to the communal area (the pool is gated off and we have banned that area to avoid touching the gates/benches etc) but we cannot be more than 1 household there at a time. We've fallen into a routine at this point where we know pretty much what time who goes to the area and luckily everyone has been courteous to not hog the area. We also communicate via WhatsApp to just let each other know if we are going there for a small walk.   Perhaps this is a compromise for your situation? 

Otherwise guess they'll die and that's on them."
worldnews,fmn64zd,t1_fmn4j0f,1586219008.0,"Maybe it is actually too early to tell what is contributing to the reduction in drunk driving related accidents and violence as we haven't done any surveys. I would only imagine that the less alcohol is available, the less it can be consumed. Maybe time will tell what the reasons are for the drop in these numbers when a comprehensive study can be done. Until then, I'm sure there are studies around how countries have been able to reduce drunk driving and what the measures were which may help postulate the current factors in SA.  

Reason aside, it's great that there are less deaths since alcohol abuse is a big crisis in SA."
worldnews,fmn4ctm,t1_fmn2p9h,1586217941.0,"Sure. But there's a distinction made between car accidents due to other factors and car accidents due to drunk driving. And because South Africa has a huge issue with drunk driving, I would be surprised if it isn't noted at hospitals (for legal reasons) or in autopsies."
Coronavirus,fmn2xv1,t1_fmlonsv,1586217095.0,China is a huge donor for the UN. Even the Human Rights Council and OHCHR are aware of the current genocide of Uighur Muslims but cant do anything because of China's contributions. So I wouldn't be surprised if they're too afraid to offend China by saying they doubt their statistics.
worldnews,fmn1n7j,t1_fmm6rg5,1586216328.0,The drop in car accidents from drunk drivers would be due to the alcohol ban I imagine. Many health workers who work in trauma/ER wards can probably also testify if there is a drop in number of stabbings/shootings and if the patients who are brought consumed alcohol or if they know the accused consumed alcohol.
dragonage,fme60n1,t3_fufl8z,1585990817.0,"My Warden Amell elected to be Alistair's mistress as at that time she was just so afraid of losing him. They fell in love during the worst of times and so in her head she thinks they will be able to get through anything together - however it weighs heavy on her that she cannot marry Alistair nor give him an heir. Alistair is adamant not to marry someone else, nevermind having his own bastard  which frustrates Solona. Sometimes she thinks it would be easier if he could just find some noble and fulfill his obligation to his lineage - but she knows that would break her. She left without a word to find the cure for the calling and Alistair has been trying to hunt her down - one of the reasons he was in Kirkwall was because he had learnt she was there (to meet her bestie Leliana among murmurs of unrest in the city? My own hc though). Amell plans to return to Alistair again and hopes he would have found someone else (but to her dismay he would not have). I imagine after years of subjugation and chantry indoctrination she has severely internalized a sense of inferiority toward non-mages (leading her to think she cant be happy) despite actively advocating for mage equality. 
 
Tl;dr Once they reunite they're going to have a lot of resentment to sort through but I like to think if mages are seen as equal under Divine Leliana they are finally able to marry."

southafrica,flzy2hj,t3_fs7ybo,1585637414.0,It actually worries me because I believe we are about a week behind with statistics (ofcourse it takes labs days to get results) and what this may actually mean is not enough testing is happening to see the real numbers. Hopefully with the new screening/testing measures we can get a more accurate look at the numbers!
southafrica,flkpxm7,t3_fpar7k,1585245485.0,We may not walk our dogs but will we be permitted to walk to the shops? (Provided it is within the district) - my closest shop is about a 5 minute walk away.
UnsentLetters,fku5v2m,t1_fktzsam,1584542904.0,I live in South Africa and I know we have a problem with child sex rings but damn. Seeing this and hearing it directly from someone who was married to one of these disgusting people. I hope he gets sentenced soon and you have peace knowing he is paying for his crimes. Your son is so so so lucky to have you as his mother to keep him safe. Stay safe during these strange days and may you find the love and peace that your little family deserves.
TheMandalorianTV,fidiq6w,t3_f7jpai,1582367534.0,"As a law grad student I have many questions. What is the jurisdiction? Does Baby Yoda have any documentation? Who are their representatives? How do I become a lawyer for a Mandalorian? Who will be the presiding officer? What's in the best interest of the foundling? 

As a fan of Mandalorian culture and history I say the only solution is obviously a fight to death with the victor taking custody."

BPD,fi3c86e,t3_f63pk5,1582111343.0,"In the past I felt this way - it took a toxic relationships where I was his one and only (legit he didn't even want friends) to realise how much pressure I had on me and how my life became engulfed by him - only to cause resentment from my side! Funny how that works. I feel like that again sometimes - especially in friendships. Actually... most of the time. I want to be their only friend and only one in their life actually.

I hope in time you get the love you deserve and let it be beautiful and reassuring in all the ways you need it to be."
theouterworlds,fhjxjf4,t3_f3h3bg,1581658721.0,"I think I found it to be full of depth because I wonder how far indoctrination can go for people to disregard others lives ya know? Currently we are in an age where death and killing can be seen everyday through video games and films (not to sound like an angry old man) and this desensitizes a lot of us. It really struck me to think if fellow workers disregard human life - how can we expect ceo's and higher ups to have regard? The whole first part of the story really touched me where many of the workers sort of don't care for one another. It may sound terrible to us now (as it should!!) but I think there's plenty of depth when it comes to wondering how they got there and if in reality we may ever reach that stage where your worth lies in your productive value rather than human rights. 

The rest of the story really could've used more depth to explore that topic/theme though :( it felt as if a lot of effort went into Edgewater but then the other towns/planets fell sort of flat in comparison story wise. They're very beautiful though!"
