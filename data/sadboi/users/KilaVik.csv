EatingDisorders,ep41t54,t3_bts0ve,1559032323.0,"Yeah probably. Wanting to recover but that subconscious desire for control desperately tries to sneak in through every crack and It manifests in many ways. When I first started recovery my immediate reaction was to do keto. I never gave a shit about macros prior to this. Even in my worst phase of anorexia, the only thing that mattered were calories. Now I start eating 2000 calories a day and suddenly I have to restrict carbs ""because reasons and stuff"". It gave me something to control and obsess over while eating a healthy amount of calories.  Also did intermittent fasting ""because reasons"" lol it's amazing how the mind works."
socialanxiety,eohw2rl,t3_brzxzg,1558599128.0,One time I was using a self checkout at a supermarket and I accidently double scanned an item but I didn't want to disturb the attendant because she looked busy so I payed for 2 items.
socialskills,eohpw88,t3_bryz5x,1558588582.0,"Sometimes I just say incoherent BS to myself when I am impatient, nervous or have a lot on my mind. Kind of like how you fidget or pace to release tension but its with your voice. I call it vocal-fidgeting because that's essentially what it is. Just a meaningless action to release tension."
mentalhealth,eohpkr6,t3_brr6td,1558588290.0,"Yeah, relationships like this can be supportive but they also have the possibilty of turning very toxic if the two people enable each others self-destructive behaviors. This isn't an issue for me as I tend to gravitate to people who are emotionally independent like me. I am not the kind of person who finds relationships based primarily on serious emotional-stuff very fulfilling. Actually, I find it very off putting."
socialanxiety,eoadpvl,t3_br38b1,1558413910.0,"Same but I am in recovery from Anorexia and unfortunately when I am under a lot of stress from anxiety, it directly affects my digestive system. I feel sick, I get stomach cramps and diarrhea and I sometimes even vomit. This makes eating and maintaining my weight a pain. I'm not even trying to lose weight intentionally and I hate how haggard I look but some days I am so stressed and busy  and sick that I can barley find time to eat, If I can at all."
socialanxiety,eoad7zu,t3_bqih0j,1558413487.0,"If I am really self conscious about a product I am buying, I will walk an up to an hour to a supermarket I know has a self check out."
