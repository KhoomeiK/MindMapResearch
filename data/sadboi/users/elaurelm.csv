mentalhealth,firj4o0,t3_f9e4qz,1582665372.0,"In my experience, I had to find phrases/thoughts that I resonated with and made sense to me that I say in my own head to replace the other thoughts. CBT basically emphasizes that you have automatic thoughts which you can begin to replace with controlled thoughts. So for me, when I'm hearing my inner voice say stuff like I hate myself I hate myself I'm so stupid, I usually force myself to stop it in it's tracks and say stuff like I'm being too hard on myself. Everyone makes mistakes. I know I'm too hard on myself. I'm okay.

You just need to find what resonates with you, what you can truly believe when you say it to yourself in times of negative mental narration"
2meirl4meirl,f78lxyo,t1_f78d411,1573495124.0,"There's a lot of variables at play. It really depends on your hair's natural level of oil production, length, and texture. 
Shampoo is an oil stripper from the hair, so using shampoo actually can cause your body to increase oil production to compensate for the oil removed. Conditioner is supposed to counter those effects. You have to find a balance that works well for you. I have medium length, naturally oily hair. I use shampoo on my scalp and a little bit on the rest of my hair. I use a very small amount of conditioner on the ends of my hair to preserve softness and detangle it.

One option you have is to actually avoid using shampoo to get your body to regulate your hair itself. There's actually a fair amount of (albeit anecdotal) evidence saying that avoiding washing your hair often actually makes your hair better in the long run. For me, id love to try this out and see if it actually would make my hair less oily, but I'm too self-conscious to try and survive the time between washes with how oily my hair is after a day or 2. Good luck, do some research, and avoid sulfates in your hair products!"

NotHowGirlsWork,f3mqebp,t1_f3mkeux,1570991204.0,"Yeah, it's definitely a tricky situation, and I wish there was a more age neutral word to use for girls. I think the context of the conversation matters a lot, and I think coming from someone with XX chromosomes (the worst way to describe it yet haha) it's definitely not as alienating. Incel and mgtow guys definitely may use it in part because it's age neutral, but separating themselves from women/dehumanizing women is another part of their usage."
NotHowGirlsWork,f3m6xsl,t1_f3m60cb,1570983961.0,"Oh yeah, that makes sense! I think, realistically, there's a number of reasons they use female as a term, and I think both our ideas play into it!"
NotHowGirlsWork,f3m3yq4,t1_f3m3oda,1570982699.0,I also don't think they're worried about offending women lol. Incel type dudes/mgtow dudes tend to be pretty interested in offending and demeaning us
NotHowGirlsWork,f3m3oda,t1_f3lp47m,1570982577.0,"As a girl, I've always taken it as distancing the humanity in a way, making it sound like what they're saying is more objective/scientific. It's very alienating. Similar to when people talk about homosexuals as opposed to saying gay people - it's a term loaded with such clinical connotations."
