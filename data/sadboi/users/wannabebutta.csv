Being shat out into the woods and ending up plant food. Growing into the next tree that some asshole climbs up after punching a Grizzly cub in the face. I think that.
SuicideWatch,fpy2ege,t1_fpxyb4c,1588994524.0,"Wanting to go back to a younger age and make better choices is a part of the human experience. Anybody who doesn’t feel that is one of the impossibly lucky few or has limited capacity for introspection.

I’ve spent the last three decades with video games being just about my favorite thing to do. I still play them, probably too much by average standards. It’s not too late to try new things. I have a family. I have kids. I have a career. I’m fortunate to have these things in my life. But also, I made them happen somehow. Through all the decades of depression and thoughts of suicide (which are still very much a part of my life). I made them happen. You just have to be open to things that scare the hell out of you.

You can’t change a damn thing you’ve done. And that’s okay because nobody else can either. And that makes you very much like all the rest of us. But if you aren’t willing to push for things you want or things you love then they’ll only happen by chance. And if you decide to live that way, I fully support you! But know that you can make a difference in your life. And if you ever need help trying, feel free to reach out.

Take care. And know that if you keep going down the same road or decide to try new things, you’ve got support."

SuicideWatch,fpxci0h,t1_fpvrukg,1588979968.0,"This is probably the most important/significant aspect of therapy that I think people have a hard time getting around to.

If there is no trust, there is no therapy. Whether it’s trust in the therapist, or trust in the process, or trust in yourself.

Unfortunately, the people who would benefit the most from therapy struggle with trust (myself included) due to feeling harmed by others or situations or experiences.

The most critical step beyond seeking help is trusting a part of the process once you’re able to ask for support.

Therapy rarely works for anybody who guards themself from the actual process. However understandable those walls we put are, and as much as they may protect us from certain negative experiences, they also harm us when it comes to feeling healthier.

And sometimes the therapist just sucks. And sometimes the personalities just clash. Sometimes the modality is garbage.

There are a thousand reasons why any given experience with therapy might not work. But it’ll never work without trust."

SuicideWatch,fpmxxys,t3_ge7ywe,1588744628.0,"Your experiences and your ability to communicate them make you lovable. The trick is to recognize that about yourself.

I think for some of us, it’s hard to see what we bring to the table. We mind-read, misinterpret, catastrophize. We fill in the blanks for others and say the worst things possible about ourselves.

These thoughts, and inclinations toward self-deprecation happen on auto-pilot. Some culmination of our experiences/biology results in this line of thinking.

The effort it requires for someone like us to challenge those thoughts at every turn is exhausting. And fortunately we don’t have to challenge them all to persevere. We just have to challenge them enough.

Up to this point, you’ve challenged them enough. I have too. And up to now, our perseverance in the face of all our experiences makes us worth loving. And this statement is ignoring all the little nuances that make us important to the people in our lives.

The same goes to everybody else reading this. Whether you‘re fifteen or fifty. You are important to somebody. Even if it’s some random person on reddit who‘s been lurking for years that decided to make an account tonight just to reply to this thread."
