Baking,fin42c3,t1_fin1nox,1582555269.0,"No problem, the cake is super moist (thanks butter)

350g flour

6tsp baking powder

350g soft soft unsalted butter

350g  sugar

6 large eggs

1 tablespoon vanilla extract (you can use other extracts for different flavors)
 
About 40ml milk

Gel or powder food coloring (liquid doesn't get that bright) 

Steps

Cream your butter and sugar until combined, then add an egg at a time, flour, baking powder and vanilla extract. Add as much milk as you need if the consistency seems too thick. 
Divide into as much portions as you want and add food coloring to each one until you get a color you like. (I made 6 layers that were about 16 cm in diameter) 
Bake in a preheated oven (170 degrees Celsius) for about 20 minutes keeping a close eye on them"

It starts with a young mother who struggles raising her adolescent child who has issues with being aggressive, but then it slowly gets better, they bond with the neighbour (a lady that has lost a child) and start building a wonderful relationship.

You start rooting for them being happy, for their lives to go on like that, and then everything they built together is destroyed.
