You 100% need therapy. There‚Äôs so much abuse here, so much hurt, anger, betrayal, abandonment and trauma. Heavy trauma. You deserve to have a good, healthy life and moving forward getting support and help with how to control your anger will be key here. 

Anger is a VERY easy emotion to have and for me, it almost always is just the tip of the [anger iceberg ](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-anger-iceberg/) with so many emotions feeding it. Once you work through those you can feel calmer. 

I wish you so much love and strength. I just want to give you a big hug. They‚Äôve missed out on a wonderful son and that is their loss."
