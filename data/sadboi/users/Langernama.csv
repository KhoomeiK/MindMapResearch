>**Concern that new strategy, which also includes protecting primeval forests, ‚Äòlacks tools‚Äô**
>
>The European commission will launch a sweeping effort to tackle the global biodiversity crisis on Wednesday, including a call for 3bn trees to be planted in the EU by 2030 and a plan to better protect the continent‚Äôs last primeval forests.
>
>The draft policy document, [published online](https://www.arc2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Biodiversity-Strategy_draft_200423_ARC2020.pdf) by an environmental NGO, admits that to date in the EU, ‚Äúprotection has been incomplete, restoration has been small-scale, and the implementation and enforcement of legislation has been insufficient‚Äù.
>
>Scientists and environmental groups, commenting on the leaked draft of the strategy, say that while the new goals are welcome and impressive, there is a still distinct lack of tools with which to implement them.
>
>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good and ambitious document, but what is also obvious is the lack of strategy of how to implement it, and a lack of discussion of why previous documents of this type failed,‚Äù said Przemys≈Çaw Chylarecki of the Polish Academy of Sciences.
>
>The new strategy calls for nearly one-third of EU land and sea to become protected zones. Currently, 26% of land and 11% of seas are classed as protected areas, but the European commission acknowledges this has not been enough to tackle the degradation of the natural world and threat of extinction to some birds and animals. Environmentalists say even these previous targets for protection have not been met in practice.
>
>‚ÄúThe proposed strategy lacks game-changing ideas and instruments for reaching the targets. We already know today that existing frameworks are not delivering, so why should we wait,‚Äù said Robert Cyglicki, programme director of Greenpeace in central and eastern [Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news).
>
>He welcomed the new strategy but said it would be 2024 before it became clear if new binding measures would be adopted, and called for immediate discussions over funding and enforcement mechanisms.
>
>Some elements of the programme, such as protecting migratory bird populations, are hard to implement without a global approach, and the paper calls on the EU to intensify efforts to make biodiversity a central part of its diplomacy.
>
>It concludes that global efforts to tackle the biodiversity crisis under the auspices of the UN have been ‚Äúinsufficient to halt the loss of the world‚Äôs biodiversity‚Äù.
>
>It will also turn the spotlight on the EU‚Äôs ‚Ç¨60bn-a-year common agricultural policy, which has been [criticised for fuelling a steep decline in nature](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/05/europe-must-act-on-intensive-farming-to-save-wildlife-scientists-say), with a call for a quarter of the EU‚Äôs agricultural land to be organically farmed by 2030.
>
>Environmentalists warned the plan‚Äôs headline target to plant at least 3bn trees by 2030, ‚Äúin full respect of ecological principles‚Äù, should only be a small part of the solution.
>
>‚ÄúPlanting 3bn trees is a really spectacular and visual goal, but it [has been shown](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6491/580) that planting new trees is not a panacea and doesn‚Äôt always help,‚Äù said Chylarecki.
>
>More important will be the goal to map, monitor and ‚Äústrictly protect‚Äù the EU‚Äôs last remaining primeval forests, which have survived in almost every member state, but remain threatened by human activity, such as [illegal logging](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/violence-escalates-as-romania-cracks-down-on-illegal-timber-trade).
>
>These older forests provide a natural shield against climate change, but in many countries have been preyed on by logging companies, with national governments either ignoring the situation or lacking the resources to properly police logging.
>
>‚ÄúWe believe an integrated approach that also includes smart financial mechanisms and social aspects is the key aspect of a future European biodiversity governance framework,‚Äù said Romania‚Äôs environment minister, Costel Alexe, who has said he wants to better protect the large area of old-growth forests in the country.
>
>C√©sar Luena, a Spanish socialist MEP and vice-chair of the European parliament‚Äôs environment committee, agreed that the 2030 targets ‚Äúwill need to be covered by legislation to make them binding‚Äù on member states.
>
>‚ÄúIf the new strategy remains just a collection of ideas, nothing will ever happen,‚Äù he said in emailed comments. He said the strategy ‚Äúseems more ambitious than the previous one but there are still areas for improvement‚Äù.
>
>Luena said EU member states needed to comply with existing laws, noting that in the last week alone, the European commission launched legal action against 19 governments over failures on EU environmental law ‚Äì a tally of charges far from unusual in the commission‚Äôs monthly round up of infringement proceedings.
>
>Sweden and Latvia have been accused of not implementing parts of the EU‚Äôs birds and habitats directives, Malta is faulted for not conserving endangered bluefin tuna, while France, Cyprus and Lithuania are said to have neglected to write EU air pollution standards into national law.
>
>The EU should also offer funding benefits for those governments serious about hitting targets, said campaigners.
>
>‚ÄúAt the EU level we need some sort of financial stimulus that would make it attractive for countries to focus on biodiversity,‚Äù said Marta Grundland, a campaigner with Greenpeace Poland.
>
>‚ÄúRight now, I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs a EU priority or a national priority. After climate this is the second biggest threat we are facing, and it‚Äôs all connected. If we want to help with the climate crisis we should also tackle the biodiversity crisis.‚Äù"

>
>BUDAPEST (Reuters) - A Hungarian school unlawfully segregated minority Roma students for years, the country‚Äôs top court said in a final ruling on Tuesday, granting 100 million forints ($310,000) in compensation to the children‚Äôs families.
>
>Nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is at odds with the European Union for his perceived erosion of the rule of law, hinted in January that the state should disobey any court order to pay restitution to the Roma and provide training instead.
>
>The Kuria (Supreme Court) case involved an elementary school in Gyongyospata, a town that has been a flashpoint of ethnic tensions in the past.
>
>‚ÄúThe supreme legal forum upheld... (an earlier) ruling which mandated a 100 million forint damages payment,‚Äù the Kuria said in a statement. ‚ÄúStudents from the Roma ethnic minority were unlawfully segregated and given substandard education.‚Äù
>
>The ruling was a ‚Äúbad decision which upends social peace as it unilaterally and overhwelmingly punishes a whole town for the real or imagined grievances of a minority‚Äù, Laszlo Horvath, Orban‚Äôs special envoy on resolving Roma issues, told national news agency MTI in a video message.
>
>Horvath, a member of the ruling Fidesz party and the area‚Äôs representative in Parliament, said he would propose legal changes to prevent such court decisions.
>
>Analysts say Orban has been stepping up anti-Roma rhetoric and has had little to lose politically from ignoring the plight of a minority that has for centuries faced prejudice and discrimination in Hungary and elsewhere in eastern Europe.
>
>Roma in Hungary live in disproportionate poverty, suffer from prejudice in schools and workplaces and have been subject to intimidation and occasionally deadly violence by the far right, rights activists say.
>
>Orban used his first major press conference this year to decry the damages award to 60 Gyongyospata Roma and their families by a lower court.
>
>He said the Roma had created an unruly and threatening environment in the school and majority Hungarian parents had begun taking their kids to a school in a neighbouring town.
>
>‚ÄúThey feel like they are in a hostile environment in their own homeland...No way,‚Äù Orban told reporters, igniting protests where more than 2,000 Hungarians, including Roma families, warned Orban ‚Äúno one is above the law‚Äù and ‚Äúthe future cannot be built on hatred‚Äù.
>
>Last month, Roma leaders said the coronavirus pandemic posed a grave threat to the already precarious status of their community, with many Roma feeling abandoned by Orban‚Äôs government.
>
>Orban launched a major financial stimulus plan to soften the economic blow from the coronavirus, focusing on bolstering investment and employment but bypassing the very poor - often Roma who typically work in casual day jobs without security and have little access to standard medical care.

>Chinese diplomats have also approached German government officials to persuade them to make positive statements on how Beijing is handling the pandemic, a letter dated April 22 from the German interior ministry to a German parliamentarian Margarete Bause showed.
>
>The letter, reviewed by Reuters, said the diplomats had made individual contact with German officials to seek ‚Äúpositive public statements about the coronavirus management of the People‚Äôs Republic of China.‚Äù It said Germany had not complied.
>
>And senior Chinese foreign ministry officials on several occasions pressured EU diplomats to block publication of an EU report analysing alleged Chinese disinformation online about the virus, according to documents seen by Reuters and diplomatic sources. The Chinese foreign ministry said the report would be ‚Äúvery bad for cooperation,‚Äù according to the April 22 EU diplomatic cable.
>
>The internal version of the report, dated April 20 and reviewed by Reuters after parts were previewed by Politico, noted as a main finding that ‚ÄúChina has continued to run a global disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the outbreak of the pandemic and improve its international image.‚Äù
>
>In the public version, published on April 24 as a ‚Äúsnapshot overview,‚Äù criticism of China was given less prominence.
>
>Top EU diplomat Borrell, called before the European Parliament on April 30 to explain the discrepancy between the versions, said there had been no watering-down, the published document was directed at a different public and while diplomatic pressures always exist, ‚ÄúWe have not bowed to anyone.‚Äù
>
>Beijing has long played on tensions between the EU‚Äôs founding states and its newer, formerly Communist members, through a special contact group of mostly east European countries called the 17+1, in which China is the 1. China has promised billions of dollars to countries which otherwise rely on EU development funds or outside investment to build railways, roads, airports and power stations.
>
>China‚Äôs close relationships with such states make it harder for them to stand up to Beijing when Brussels wants them to, EU officials and diplomats say.
>
>Even before the pandemic in the first two months of 2020, one diplomat said, Slovenia and Slovakia had requested help from the European Commission in pushing back against China‚Äôs pressure to take its side on issues including human rights. He said the states had effectively sent the message: ‚ÄúHelp us: We don‚Äôt have the political clout to stand up to the Chinese.‚Äù
>
>Slovenia‚Äôs foreign ministry said it had not sought such help, but did not know if others had. In a statement to Reuters, it said ‚Äúvery intensive‚Äù talks had been going on for an accord to be agreed at the EU-China summit which ‚Äúwill balance out the relations between the EU and China.‚Äù Slovakia did not respond to a request for comment.
>
>##MASK DIPLOMACY
>
>When COVID-19 hit Italy and Spain, two large and influential member states, fellow EU members such as Germany initially came under fire for offering scant help. But China sent hundreds of thousands of testing kits and facemasks to them and other countries.
>
>Italy, in particular, has been grateful. A poll of 800 people in Italy, carried out by the SWG research institute between March 20 and April 12, showed more than 50% of Italians consider China a friendly country, while other polls have shown once-solid support for EU membership falling.
>
>China‚Äôs ‚Äòmask diplomacy‚Äô also spurred a dramatic change of tone from Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis. Before the pandemic, he had called for the removal of the Chinese ambassador after a threatening letter from the embassy over a Czech lawmaker‚Äôs planned visit to Taiwan.
>
>But as COVID-19 infections spread, Babis raced to the airport to personally greet a planeload of medical supplies from China, and publicly thanked the ambassador he had wanted withdrawn.
>
>Babis said there was no connection between those actions. ‚ÄúWhen I did not like the communication of the ambassador, I said so,‚Äù he said in a statement to Reuters. ‚ÄúThe same way, I did not have any problem to thank him publicly when he did his share.‚Äù
>
>Not all responses have been as simple. Dutch, Spanish and other European authorities have questioned the quality of equipment sent - the Netherlands recalled some masks that had been distributed to hospitals on the grounds that they were not surgical, the Dutch health ministry said.
>
>China rejected such complaints, saying for example that faulty test kits in Spain were provided by a company without a proper licence that had nothing to do with government shipments.
>
>##SUMMITRY
>
>In the EU headquarters in Brussels and in European capitals, discussions are underway about how to respond to China‚Äôs toughening line.
>
>Europe is intent on ensuring closer cooperation with Beijing on landmark issues like climate policy, especially after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. EU and Chinese representatives spoke on May 11 about opening up on trade. But there is little clarity on the diplomatic road.
>
>The EU-China summit may take place on June 3, according to a European Commission planning note, but by video conference, rather than in person in Beijing.
>
>The last time China policy was discussed by the EU‚Äôs 27 envoys in Brussels in March, Ireland‚Äôs envoy expressed concern that China‚Äôs ‚Äúhuge propaganda machine‚Äù may win the narrative on trade, cooperation and the summit, according to the minutes seen by Reuters.

>This year was meant to be an important one for Sino-EU ties. Until the virus emerged in Wuhan in December, the EU had started to make progress with Beijing after tense summits in 2016 and 2017 ended without any joint declarations. Last year, the European Commission dubbed China an economic competitor and ‚Äúsystemic rival.‚Äù
>
>Beijing in April 2019 acquiesced for the first time on key issues such as equal treatment of European companies in China, after months of negotiations, according to senior EU officials. That accord was to be followed this year by an EU-China summit in Beijing and a meeting between Chinese leader Xi and EU national leaders in Leipzig, Germany, in September.
>
>But now, besides practical obstacles to such meetings from social distancing, both sides are pushing back against each other.
>
>In China, the virus has compounded an already more pugnacious approach to international affairs - dubbed ‚ÄúWolf Warrior‚Äù diplomacy in both Western and Chinese media - after two popular Chinese movies in which the action hero outguns and outsmarts nefarious U.S. special agents.
>
>Spurred by Xi‚Äôs calls for the country to be more imposing, Chinese diplomats have pushed back against criticism of its handling of the outbreak, in every forum from social media to TV, newspaper op-eds, and diplomatic correspondence.
>
>A striking example was on April 12, when the Chinese embassy in Paris posted an unsigned article on its website that suggested care workers in Western nursing homes had abandoned their jobs, leaving residents to die. China‚Äôs ambassador in Paris, Lu Shaye, was summoned by the French foreign ministry and wrote a post saying ties between China and France remain strong, but did not withdraw the comments, which France rejected.
>
>Chinese foreign ministry officials told EU diplomats that the issue was one for France and China, not the wider EU, and that ‚Äúit was now at an end,‚Äù according to a diplomatic cable from the EU delegation in Beijing to Brussels from April 22.
>
>On April 26, China‚Äôs embassy in France posted another article on its website complaining of ‚ÄúChina bashing‚Äù and claiming that ‚Äúsome Westerners are beginning to distrust liberal democracy.‚Äù The article said that ‚Äúin the response to the epidemic, socialism with Chinese characteristics has demonstrated its ability to concentrate resources in the service of great achievements.‚Äù
>
>Janka Oertel, head of the Asia programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said China is transferring its domestic approach to controlling public perception to the diplomatic arena.
>
>‚ÄúChina is desperately trying to get its coronavirus story out there and as far as it‚Äôs concerned set the record straight,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs trying to do what it does domestically, which is create a narrative and protect its reputation.‚Äù"

>
>Seeking to mark an anniversary of the European Union‚Äôs relations with China on May 6, he and the EU‚Äôs 27 ambassadors co-wrote an opinion piece titled ‚ÄúEU-China ties vital amid global crisis,‚Äù for publication on embassy websites and in China Daily, an English-language newspaper controlled by the state.

He had, the EU executive said on May 7, unilaterally decided to accept it, with ‚Äúconsiderable reluctance.‚Äù
>
>Chapuis told a news conference the omission was ‚Äúregrettable;‚Äù his boss, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, subsequently spoke out against censorship by China‚Äôs state controlled media. Borrell also said that accepting the cut ‚Äúwas not the right decision to take,‚Äù though Chapuis kept his job.

>
>In a campaign of increasingly assertive and at times aggressive diplomacy, China has sought to pressure European countries that criticise its handling of the outbreak, Reuters found. At a time when Europe‚Äôs ties with the United States are already strained by President Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄòAmerica First‚Äô policy, the fallout from the coronavirus underscores how the EU is caught between two powers - needing both, but reluctant to side with either.
>
>On the one hand, officials in Brussels and European capitals argue they need to show China that the European Union ‚Äì the world‚Äôs largest trading bloc and a wealthy market of 450 million consumers ‚Äì won‚Äôt be pushed around.
>
>On the other, countries within Europe are rarely unanimous. States such as Germany have large trade relationships with China that they don‚Äôt want to jeopardise. German manufacturers, for example, depend on China, Germany‚Äôs biggest trading partner, to both supply components and to buy their cars.
>
>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have the structure or culture to reciprocate the assertiveness or use power plays like China,‚Äù one diplomat said. ‚ÄúThe aim of European diplomacy since the Second World War has been all about finding a compromise. China doesn‚Äôt necessarily look at things the same way at all.‚Äù

>_By Anastasia Moloney_
>
>BOGOTA, July 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A court in Ecuador has upheld a ruling that prevents the government from selling land in the Amazon rainforest to oil companies, a move activists called a historic win for the Waorani indigenous tribe living there.
>
>The government had appealed an earlier court ruling in April that the 2,000-strong tribe had not been properly consulted over plans to auction their ancestral lands to oil companies.
>
>The decision late on Thursday from Pastaza province in the eastern Amazon to uphold the ruling ends the years-long legal battle over the land, campaigners said.
>
>""This victory is for my ancestors. It's for our forest and future generations. And it's for the whole world,"" said Nemonte Nenquimo, president of the Waorani Pastaza Organization on Friday.
>
>Ecuador's energy ministry - a respondent in the case - was not immediately available to comment.
>
>The ministry said in April that the government had carried out a proper consultation process with the Waorani according to the ""law and international standards"".
>
>The ruling could set a precedent for other tribes opposed to drilling, campaigners said.
>
>Ecuador is pushing to open up more rainforest and develop its oil and gas reserves in the hope of improving its sluggish economy and cutting its high fiscal deficit and foreign debt.
>
>Tensions have simmered between indigenous communities and oil companies in Ecuador since Texaco - now Chevron - began operations in the Amazon in the 1960s.
>
>The constitution gives the government the right to develop energy projects and extract minerals on any land, regardless of who owns it, but requires that communities are first consulted and properly informed about any projects and their impact.
>
>This week's ruling protects half a million acres of land in the Amazon forest on which the Waorani have lived for centuries from being earmarked for oil drilling, campaigners said.
>
>It ""permanently voids the consultation process with the Waorani undertaken by the Ecuadorian government in 2012, indefinitely suspending the auctioning of their lands,"" said campaign group Amazon Frontlines, which supported the Waorani.
>
>The head of Amazon Frontlines Mitch Anderson said the win ""shows once again that the fate of the Amazon rainforest, and consequently our climate, hinges on whether or not indigenous people can continue to protect their rainforest territories and cultures"".
