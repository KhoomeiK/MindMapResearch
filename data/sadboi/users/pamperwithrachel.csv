worldnews,fg8m2mi,t3_exi4b4,1580623946.0,"This is another reason I won't sail Norwegian. Before this during Hurricane Florence last year they altered from a Bermuda cruise to a Canada New England cruise after many travelers would have arrived in town. Most didn't have the appropriate clothing for the trip. No other cruise line would have even considered doing this, they cancelled or changed to other parts of the Caribbean. Their ""free at sea"" is a scam when you compare it to similar offers from other cruise lines and has also led to poor service on board due to lack of gratuities (even though they charge the highest gratuity of all the cruise lines). 

They don't conform to industry standards on guest compensation for missed ports and changed itineraries and as we can see are once again waiting until the last minute to let guests know what is going to happen when other cruise lines and airlines have already heeded the do not travel warning from the State Department."

I have no want to divorce my husband, nor marry my boyfriend. We have different types of relationships.

This is primarily an option instead of surrogacy and sperm donors and yes, he is genetically fit and would be an excellent person for breeding purposes.

They've both been in my life a very long time, 1 for 12 years, the other for 16. In addition to romantic partners we are also close friends so I do have reason to believe both will be around for the foreseeable future. This is also why this becomes a question on involvement. I expect both of them to continue to be in my life, so if my boyfriend decides the biological father, I don't want to cut him out of that if he wants some type of involvement."

We've discuss the child rearing on either end but not in any kind of combinations. My relationship with each is separate from the other, we don't overlap in our lives.

I also know surrogacy or artificially insemination get expensive fast which is why I am thinking of this as a possible alternative."

Before I was diagnosed he dealt so well even with the rapid cycling. He's kind and supportive in so many ways, but this one issue he just won't let go of. If it was anything else we could work out a compromise like we have on everything else for the last 5 years. This is one of the things though that can't be compromised on. I don't want to have a child and end up being my mother or not being able to bond with them because I never wanted them. It's not fair to ask him to give that up as much as its not fair for him to ask it of me. It's one of the only things we can't come to terms with and kind of makes me want to call off the wedding.

polyamory,eu4i5rj,t1_eu43l1d,1563454630.0,"So interestingly enough, you helped me answer my question. I definitely am poly, but I'm very much questioning if you are. Even if I love another person, I would never stop loving my fiance. I love him all the time, nonstop. I love him as my partner, as the future father of my kids, and as my best friend. But I have so much love that I have enough to love him and another person, maybe even more than one, I don't know yet. You're looking at it as 2 half filled cups whereas to me it looks like one of those champagne fountains.
Outside of just the sexual aspect I would want to have some melding. Activities we all like, things we can do together. Not sure I would want us all to live together because that's a lot of people together most of the time but I don't want to lead 2 separate lives. I want one that maybe just doesn't look like everyone else's.
And the idea of saying someone isn't enough kind of sounds dumb to me. People are complex and have incredibly complex needs. The idea that one person can fulfill all of your needs, like all the same things as you, etc. Why can't you have different people that fulfill different aspects of your needs? I could have someone more adventurous, he could have one more interested in politics than me. These are things we don't necessarily fulfill for each other. I'm sure I have a ways to go in figuring out how to explain it to him but my idea about this is not so narrow."

buffy,esn6a7z,t1_esn56ti,1562123659.0,"You do have to take into consideration where Dawn would have been and how involved she was in past portions of the storyline we don't see. Likely Riley and Buffy's relationship developed when she was living away from home and with Dawn significantly out of the picture because of this. 
In no place like home, we see her moving back in, saying she's not on campus anyways, a clear difference from the previous time period. And while Dawn isn't always there, she is in the picture considerably more than she would have been while Buffy lived away. Her constant need to take care of her sister eats into the rest of the series. After Riley she never really dates again ( I don't count her trysts with Spike dating, more FB territorry) because after moving home to care for her family there is no longer room for anyone else in her life again. 
I also agree the memory spell affected both of them because you do see less affection between them occurring. Not none but it dies down substantially. I believe his decision that she doesn't love him was a direct effect of the changes in their memories. She's less able to give in a relationship because of her sister and this would have bled into previous seasons as well."
