This really sets off my possible-narcissist radar. My advice would be no contact. This person has potential to eat up time and emotional energy no matter what the response is."
AskReddit,fqimtde,t3_giz37i,1589398095.0,"Walla! (an exclamation said like wah-la meaning ""behold!"" or ""there it is!"") is NOT a goddamn word.

It is ""Voila"". A French word that the English language has adopted, while also dropping the accent on the a.

I will fight anyone who continues to use walla after being informed that's not what the word is."

I had a missed miscarriage at 13 weeks, where my unborn had died in utero 4 weeks prior and I didn't know. Had to be put under for a procedure and everything because my body didn't know to finish miscarrying.  It was absolutely traumatic but still not even in the ballpark of what Joy experienced."

He needs to get counseling of his own accord and he needs to be the one to make the effort and do it NOW and at the very least you need to distance yourself from him until after he's gotten that help.  In the best scenario you just leave him for good right now.

I just got out of an emotionally (and escalating to physical) abusive relationship with a ""dominant"" person.  Saying they'll get help ""with you"", in their mind justifies it as you are part of the problem, when in reality the problem is them.  I went to couples counseling with this person, they would fight with me and make me cry and threaten via text while I was driving to the appointment and then in front of the therapist they would cry about how they just wanted to hold me and help me and make me not hurt.  
Please get away from this person, and seek counseling on your own to undo any gaslighting or wear down of healthy boundaries you might have experienced.  It doesn't matter if they love you or you love them.  They are hurting you in a real way and will continue to."
