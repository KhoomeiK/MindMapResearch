When I started we were both in long-term relationships. We would chat at work a bunch, and got along great, I always looked forward to talking to him. Eventually, him and his girlfriend split, and a few months later I dumped my boyfriend. 

He was 12 years older than me, but we'd flirt whenever we ""ran into each other"" which happened quite a bit.. at this point we began talking outside of work and hit it off. We screwed around for a few months, and he treated me better than anyone I had ever dated. There was something there, and I wanted a relationship. He didn't, I think things were going too fast after both our relationships. The night we parted ways, before I left, we both cried as we hugged each other. 
Work was awful after that, having to see him everyday. I've never missed anyone like that. A month ago I took a leave of absence, and didn't properly say goodbye. Because I'd be coming back in two months anyhow. 

Today I found out he was fired, and I'll never be able to say goodbye. He was one of the best people I have ever met. I think I'll always miss him. He said we couldn't be together because of the age difference, and I respect that, I only hope he can overcome his struggles and become a better man, I want nothing but the best for him.
