adrenochrome,fqadnn2,t1_fqa7x6f,1589217293.0,"That’s an incredible realization to have. I never thought about it like that, how if we were designed to eat meat that ripping apart a gazelle would appear mouth watering to us. That reminds me of how the military has to go to great lengths to train a human to be a trained killer. Since it isn’t in human nature to kill each other, we have to go to great lengths to condition people to commit such an act. And even with all that training there is a significant percentage of those people will go on to suffer from PTSD, drug addiction and suicide. 

The biggest change that I’ve experienced in my life from being vegan is how compassionate I’ve become towards living beings of all kinds. Not only am I a kinder person towards animals, but also towards myself and towards others. One thing that isn’t discussed is how physically addictive eating meat is. It could also be argued that with all the drugs that are put into the animals we slaughter for food, that we are getting addicted to those drugs. I know that in zoos and places like sea world a lot of the animals are on heavy amounts of benzodiazepines like Valium or Xanax to keep them docile and complacent. Those are very physically and mentally addictive. 

There are a lot of arguments that people get into regarding drugs, vaccines, nutrition, among others that are coming from a position of ignorance. So many of our scientists are put in positions where they are being corrupted and the place they hold in society as being educated and knowing the science is being taken advantage to serve an agenda that is not pro-human. Why do people get into almost a religious fervor over hating on anti-vaxxers when they themselves do not even know the real state of things???

What those people are really saying is “Hey shut up and go back to sleep, you’re making me feel uncomfortable about the world that I live in and you are challenging my preconceived notions of what the world we live in is really about”.

So sad. We are just barely conscious enough to know that we don’t know all that much. But most people aren’t honest with themselves about this. They want to keep living under the assumption that they have a good grasp on things and understand the world that we live in and what our purpose here is. The honest truth is that nobody here knows wtf is going on, why we’re here, or what our purpose is. This is why there are so many cults and bizarre religions made up by man to try and explain what our purpose is."
adrenochrome,fqa3vg8,t1_fq9y9q8,1589212351.0,"We have to be good leaders in society and only hold up those that are worthy of attention for real empathy and real action rather than empty words and virtue signaling. Just today I was speaking with some people in my community and discussed the real health benefits of a plant based diet. It’s not something that I stand to make money from, and exposing others to a way of life that will bring them positive mental and physical health is something that benefits us all. The thing that this pandemic has exposed is that the health of people in our society directly impacts each of us and each other. It’s not just each of us out for ourselves. If my neighbor is sick, then I stand a chance of getting sick as well. So I want everyone to have access to healthcare and the first line of defense is a healthy diet. I know that talking about a vegan diet can get a lot of hate online, but it’s something that has brought me a lot of happiness and promoted positive mental health as much as it does for physical health.

It’s wonderful that there have been strikes at Amazon and Whole Foods (among others), they need to take this opportunity to get a living wage and healthcare. I think that the biggest reason this government doesn’t want everyone to be on Medicare is because they have been actively working against people’s health while they have not been directly responsible for taking care of them. I just watched “Vaxxed” last night and it was stunning how much autism has exploded due to vaccines. It’s not even open to argument. They said that by 2030, 50% of all women born and 80% of all men born will have autism. That alone will bring this country to it’s knees by forcing us to take care of all these people who are incapable of caring for themselves. It’s going to happen either way, unless we get on top of this right now. I would highly recommend you watch it, I found it for free on YouTube as amazon has censored it from their Prime streaming service. If you want a link I can post it or PM you."

The way that votes are manipulated through gerrymandering or other means is just so despicable. Already people who have been convicted of a felony are not allowed to vote, which makes no sense. We need everyone to take part in the political process if we want the public policy to be pro-human rather than pro-corporation. 

For example, even if you are the biggest racist that hates black people and don’t want them to have a voice, you are still better off to have them vote because the better that things get for everybody the better things get for you. Do you see what I’m saying?
