SuicideWatch,eqse3s2,t1_eqreron,1560282796.0,"I'm a class away from graduating and don't have room to add in another major. If I stayed additional semesters, I'd run out of scholarship money, unless I could manage to get more somehow.

Still, you're right that it's not too late for me to switch, even if it's post-graduation. It'll just complicate the situation for me, and I don't think I have the energy to deal with that at the moment. Even if I am logically aware that I'm not stuck in a hole I dug for myself, I feel like I am. It may just take some more time for me to convince my brain that it's true."
SuicideWatch,eqsdb38,t1_eqr4wxe,1560282280.0,"There are times that I think I'm depressed. During those episodes, I lose interest in things I once enjoyed and feel a general hopelessness. It's not that I feel like crying so much, just like not doing anything.

When I say chronically sad, I mean that I pretty frequently feel a potent misery that comes and goes on its own or as a reaction to (usually minor) stimuli. I think this is still depression, but a specific side of it that I'm trying to capture with my phrasing.

As a disclaimer, this isn't medical advice, just my personal interpretation of how I feel."
SuicideWatch,eqschjh,t1_eqquneu,1560281749.0,"I'm currently studying a ""hard"" science, and I've been thinking off and on that I want to make the transition to a different ""soft"" science. I only need one more class to get my BS in my current field, so I'll suck it up and take it. Still, I feel locked in and don't know how I could make the transition."

SuicideWatch,eqqt68s,t1_eqqsf6y,1560231573.0,"yeah, tacos are good too. bean and cheese is my fav.

i feel like i'm stuck in a career i don't want. others would say i've been ""successful,"" but i've wanted to blow my brains out for the last year.

i also can't seem to get into another relationship after my first one (which lasted almost three years and ended several months ago).

i've been chronically sad off-and-on since 5th grade, and i'm in college now, so i think it's just a general depression that my mind tries to justify however it can."
