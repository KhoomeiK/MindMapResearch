If you want to use wood, depending on your country, I'd strongly recommend you to use oak (as it's cheaper, even though briarwood is much more resistant) or some type of hardwood. You can make the wand on a lathe or if you don't have acess to one,  carve it like you did. But I'd recommend you to first use a not so sharp knife if you don't have carving knives. Scrap the bark away gently and take a look at the wood's moisture. That's the part I'd recommend you to take an entire limb. If it's too moist, leave it to rest VERTICALLY somewhere dry.

I act based on the old honour system. I never break my word. I never break my vows. I always need to see balance on things. I'm a firm believer in Lex Talionis. Also, I help when I can. But I never expect anything in return. To offer your hand to feel better about yourself is narcissism, and narcissism is just a mirror where you live for yourself. There's no honour in fighting only for your own gain. So, I help if I can. And I condemn when I thing an act is dishonourable. I live by thinking about not compensating yourself when you don't really need compensation and punishing when dishonour occurs. I've beaten more than one abusive husbands, I've fucked up more than one person who commited a transgression. I am judge, criminal and enforcer at the same time.

As for religion, I beelieve in Jesus, Muhammad, Ingmar Bergman, Yukio Mishima... I think men didn't kill God. And I don't believe in God as real, but a symbol is just as effective as the real deal. Jesus was just men. For me, he didn't turn water into wine. That is more likely that he didn't condemn, as God is Father and Jesus is Son. Cain was Brother with Abel, and in indo-myths, only one brother can survive. So. I thinf that Nietzsche was wrong. We killed the Son, who was forgiveness and love. Who was trying to change the Father, who's only Power and authority. The Father lives. Look at the world. The Son is dead. For me, they are all symbols. Not real things.

Forgotten_Realms,fleoyrr,t1_flemx9y,1585088608.0,"I think indeed that his first books were kind of fanfics. It's VERY common with novice writers. I remember Bergman in his autobiography Magic Lantern stating that his first play was a blatant copy of Shakepeare. I think Salvatore only starts his own style on the third book. First two are fanfics of Tolkien's work. Entreri was the Nazgûl, Drizzt is the guy with the swordplay who's stoic and doesn't speak much, Bruennor is the one who speaks much, Wulfgar starts nice but then becomes a character who's always the same, and Catti-brie needs the rest of the group to be a character with personality. Regis is more intriguing. But he's got a small object that somebody sent somebody who's merciless to retrieve for him. He's a troublemaker like Merry and Pippin and he is the comical counterbalance of Drizzt, who's always the silent one. Just like Aragorn during The Fellowship of the Ring. He's only really a character you interact with when he's singing about Gil-Galad and during Boromir's death. The difference is thar Salvatore tells us what's on Drizzit's head. Or he'd be as taciturn as Aragorn's debut. He doesn't even comment when Andúril is reforged. It's mentioned but he says nothing. I think Salvatore's favourite characters are Aragorn and Galadriel. Because it's one of the few scenes, even seeing by Drizzt's perspective that we kind of understand him. So much that is that between the parts of the book he writes journal entries on Drizzt's perspective so that we can understand who he really is. It's the mistake I've seen many players make with their characters. They lack a hard core and it's formed in game instead of the hard core of the psyche of the character being made beforehand and acquiring more flavour during the game. I always tell my Vampire players: ""Your character just passed through my scrutiny. Now he needs to live and have traumas and suffer and feel with the world""."

unpopularopinion,flebm6w,t3_fo9xdc,1585081248.0,"Agreed. Not a fan of the US, but the US are too violent. Nobody likes them much. The Chinese build things, shower a country with gifts, get the love of the population. Luanda's downtown and Angola's 
Freeways were chinese too. Soft power in this world is a better option."
Forgotten_Realms,fleb4mm,t3_foaxct,1585080988.0,"Let us agree. The first trilogy was a poor copy of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. There's Moria, there's Smaug, there's one big fucking tower made of indestructible material with a wizard doing war with people."
AskReddit,fleaqw5,t1_fle85qo,1585080783.0,"Thanks, I never do my thing at home. Hammer them up in the head while in the woods. More practical. Quicker. Cleaning up takes time and bloodhounds and the police always find something. That piece of shit Keyes got sloppy and caught because of this."

SuicideWatch,fldqk3z,t1_fldphyf,1585069770.0,"Or looking to die. Like I did. I just need somebody to share my experiments on suicide. It's not because I want them to die. But if people are going to do it, who am I to tell them to do it or not do it?"
SuicideWatch,fld6kvy,t3_fnzcbv,1585057822.0,I understand those people. I don't agree. It's everyone's right to die. But theya downvote thinkinf they are helping.q
SuicideWatch,flcflch,t1_flc7q4m,1585029041.0,And I'm daring you to see me prove that I'll really die if I say so if the treatment fails and I dont get what I want.
SuicideWatch,flc6s9f,t1_flc5oys,1585021396.0,"But let's do this. If the treatment I'll take fails, I'll livestream it for you, as you are daring me to do it. Deal?"
SuicideWatch,flc6k8b,t1_flc5oys,1585021227.0,"Negative. I was testing less painful ways. If you read my other posts, you'd see I was trying to stop the blood flow with electric cable. Didn't work. Then I tried to reach my carotid with a knife. Didn't work. Hand won't go. Now, I just need the hook to hang. Shit is the steelworks are closed in my city because of this damn pandemic. And TODAY, somebody offered me help with my problem that might actually be a solution. I'll wait for quarantine to end, buy the hook and see if I have results. Right now I'm having a little shining piece of hope. But I'm not giving much for it anyway. Hope hardly works. But I'll try this treatment. See if it works."

I apologize if I looked like a, how we say on our group, ""he who shits rules"". You are completely right. My bad, man."
Humanoidencounters,fl8li7s,t1_fl8k5ew,1584926466.0,"Yes. It's full of western misconceptions, believe me. Best source for them is talking directly to them. Anthropology taught me there's more to oral traditions than dusty books. Even because what they did 50 years ago is different. Just like we changed our way of living in the last 50 years. Fascinating, isn't it? Culture isn't a hard core. It's fluid. It changes, adapts."
Humanoidencounters,fl8i6y9,t1_fl83tly,1584924252.0,"As I said, they aren't my area of studies. If you're a Navajo or Hopi, I'd like to hear more on the subject, if you please."
wwiipics,fl8efpn,t1_fl8bfcx,1584921808.0,"Yeah. It was joining the SS in 1944 or not seeking revenge for the death of his wife in bombardments. It would be never being able to go back to his baby daughter. 

I'd have done the same if those were the reasons. We're all proud of what he did for Hungary."
Humanoidencounters,fl7qs23,t1_fl6i11r,1584907389.0,What's good or evil? Ans is the concept of good and evil the same in judeo-christian societies compared to Navajo and Hopi ones?
WhiteWolfRPG,fl5z7g4,t1_fl5yvrk,1584849654.0,"They aren't feral. They are inhuman. That is the concept. It's in the 2d edition book of the Sabbat. They live in rat-infested hovels, wear shirty clothing and look, well, inhuman. I prefer this putrid narrative. In mt my opinion it looks more like the Sect. Abandoning all that is human."
