HealthAnxiety,fp158rh,t1_fp0e759,1588224764.0,"The fact to you are so self-aware about your mental health and the handling of medication is an incredibly good thing. You are not going nuts, but you are in a high state of anxiety. It's always good to remind ourselves that anxiety and depression pass, even if they can make us miserable for a time. 

Try to find therapists online. Everyone's going into telehealth thanks to the pandemic, some are even working with insurance like with in-person visits. Either way, perhaps your PCP can help you out with medication, but make sure they follow through on monitoring how you react to them and how well they work on you."
HealthAnxiety,fp0bp2o,t3_gakkn5,1588206187.0,"I've had bad experiences with medication that have jump-started a Health Anxiety relapse just like this. The Zoloft should be out of your body by now, if not, then soon, and I assure you, it will not cause any kind of cardiac event or stroke. Coupled with the life-changing reality of this pandemic, it is beyond understandable that you are experiencing high levels of panic and anxiety with all associated symptoms included. I would advise you to find psychological and psychiatric help as soon as possible, but I know not everyone has the means, especially given the situation. If you can, please do. And if not, try to keep in touch with support groups and friends. 

I know you're gonna be scared about tonight, especially because you have an appointment tomorrow. Trust your body. You will make it. And after seeing the doctor, you will only get better. 

Solidarity, sister."
