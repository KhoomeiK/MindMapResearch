gtaonline,fqt83fz,t3_gktvub,1589632783.0,Sad face
TheLastAirbender,fqt823m,t1_fqt6k2r,1589632754.0,The match up is close enough in my mind to go either way so I have been convinced by comments with great analysis of the situation.  Seeing how azula loses in tha catacombs against Katara and again with comet enhanced firebending I doubt it is plot armor.  I disagree piandao would win against her.  Did you not see him fighting during the comet without any sort of bending and still lived??? I‚Äôm most convinced azula wins against Korra season 1 at this point so I guess you are right on some levels.
TheLastAirbender,fqrwibj,t3_gkccbo,1589593391.0,This is literally one of the greatest things to happen to me.  Avatar day is a good day!!!

TheLastAirbender,fqm6aid,t1_fqlvqq6,1589472231.0,What comics are you guys reading to make her that strong just curious.  The last one I read was the search for zuko mom and the most I saw from her was I believe lightning redirection.

TheLastAirbender,fqg2j9e,t1_fqfwoy3,1589336609.0,True true the evasiveness of aang is really enough alone and Korra was more of a stand your ground fighter but we do see her improve during pro bending fights getting faster.  I believe Korra would initially use firebending until she realize she can‚Äôt fight azula one on one with firebending and would utilize more waterbending attacks.  Azula does not fight well against powerful waterbenders as shown in the catacombs.  Azula in my opinion is red lotus material and just with firebending alone wins against most people.  It‚Äôs just the fact that Korra was shown to be a strong firebender and the fact that she has mastered 3 elements.  It sucks amon was Op because we didn‚Äôt get to see her fight against a regular powerful bender such as a zuko or a toph character but azula was so cunning and fast she would probably win.  Korra would most likely burn herself out trying to attack azula while azula dodge most attacks then azula probably would hit a few very powerful attacks knocking Korra out.
TheLastAirbender,fqg1tkt,t1_fqfrz7r,1589336177.0,I mean atleast season 1 she was level headed and not fighting demons.  She couldn‚Äôt even stand against kuvira that‚Äôs why I believe season one really captured her greatness.  She just was put up against amon and nearly no one in ATLA could win against that man.  But I like how you broke it down unlike a lot of other people who just wants azula to be as powerful as OZAI at 14 so thank you for your input üòÄ
TheLastAirbender,fqg1js0,t1_fqfnuda,1589336014.0,You sound Dumb case closed
TheLastAirbender,fqg19wi,t1_fqflum7,1589335850.0,"You can call them no names all you want but if you put azula against any of the white lotus members in ATLA she would lose so to give no value to a white lotus member is crazy.  I‚Äôm not low balling azula I know she was one of the most powerful characters shown but you seem to not understand how powerful a firebender Korra is.  She‚Äôs a master firebender.  You SAW azula get her ass kicked by Katara in multiple occasions so for you to think that Korra, a prodigy who could waterbend at 4, trained by Katara just lose like that is nuts.  Azula was juiced up because she fought against aang who did not know firebending at the time and refused to kill her or anyone else for that matter.  I didn‚Äôt create the thread to impose my views but to see if someone could logically answer this with real input and not fanboy analysis.  Azula COULD win against Korra but your trying to make it seem obvious like Korra wasn‚Äôt a prodigy bender who already mastered 3 elements including firebending unlike aang at that time.  The only thing helping azula is her intelligence and speed. Korra could match her power.  Even by the time of the prison break in ATLA azula was seemingly on equal grounds with zuko and if you think zuko at that point wins against Korra....your just a very unconvincing person."
AvatarVsBattles,fqapvp8,t1_fq9rehv,1589223225.0,The arena in Omashu.  My idea is the BUMI is the OZAI version of earthbending.  I‚Äôm thinking azula loses.  You remember when azula said to BUMI ‚Äúyou are a very powerful earth bender right‚Äù and he gleefully said ‚ÄúMhm‚Äù.  I believe both of them knew how that fight would end before it starts.  However azula is powerful enough to be considered firelord material if OZAI was not around so I believe she still should not be underestimated.
AvatarVsBattles,fqapi2v,t1_fq98d04,1589223040.0,The version of AZULA when we first meet her in season 2 after she is shown using lightning.  The version of king BUMI that aang spared against in the OMASHU fight ring.  Azula is in her right state of mind.
AvatarVsBattles,fq93cfk,t1_fq8y0xf,1589184088.0,The fight takes place in Omashu same place he fought aang.  From the comics she is still crazy and loses badly.
AvatarVsBattles,fq8wqv5,t1_fq8tgtc,1589177806.0,True but those firebenders during the comet hardly were engaging BUMI.  They simply shot fire attacks from a tank and at best we‚Äôre fodder benders before the comet.  Azula would be all over the place dodging attacks and using offensive measures. Her lightning would be able to break earth attacks and her fire ( though not as powerful as comet enhanced attacks) would be able to make BUMI unsteady.  BUMI I suppose wins but not for the reasons you explained
AvatarVsBattles,fq8nikp,t3_ghgill,1589170458.0,"From the show perspective, Azula seemed to fear KING BUMI and only Ozai.  This made sense since she she knew who she was capable of winning against and not.  BUMI was a stronger earthbender than she was a firebender (even if slightly).  Very few could of taken her down and BUMI was one of them."
TheLastAirbender,fq7rglk,t1_fp43y83,1589150703.0,True
TheLastAirbender,fq7reqj,t1_fp45k17,1589150672.0,I actually agree with this now.  I didn‚Äôt realize that if aang knew fire bending on the same level as korra when he fought Azula those match ups would of been very different.  Korra is a master firebender and would be able to use earth or water if need be.  Azula would be surprised with korras ability.  Azula was great but slightly over hyped because she fought against someone that was unwilling to kill her.
TheLastAirbender,fq7r1gh,t1_fpa3k3d,1589150460.0,Noooooo aang did not know firebending when fighting Azula Unlike korra who was a MASTER firebender trained by the white lotus.  Also aang never fought to kill UNLIKE korra.  Azula is a brilliant strategist which may give her the edge against an emotional fighter like korra. But likely Azula would be surprised by Korras aggressiveness.
TheLastAirbender,fq7qsbw,t1_fpjfn3b,1589150317.0,Your delusional
TheLastAirbender,fq7qit0,t1_fq46w5y,1589150166.0,The difference is korra fights to kill unlike aang.  Also aang never knew fire bending when fighting Azula.  Also at this point korra is stronger than aang as she had already mastered 3 elements.  Aang Only has mastered air bending and was in the process of mastering the rest.
TheLastAirbender,fp3kaem,t1_fp3jhdo,1588280792.0,I like this response perfectly said.
TheLastAirbender,fp37cwq,t1_fp36sut,1588274365.0,Azula had dai li agents guarding her against earthbenders.  Katara in the catacombs schooled azula one on one with octopus style waterbending.  Korra was trained by Katara.......you know and I know how this fights end.
TheLastAirbender,fp36ggt,t1_fp35tk1,1588273914.0,I see your speaking as a fan and not analyzing.  Korra waterbending alone could hold her off.
TheLastAirbender,fp35azm,t1_fp327nt,1588273337.0,All true I do want to say azula does not fight best against waterbenders and that should be noted.  In the catacombs she fought poorly against Katara in a one on one.  Also during the comet Katara with water bending was able to restrain her.  Korra trained under Katara and mastered waterbending first.  If the fight takes place in southern water tribe Korra I believe would have a better chance at winning.  Korra would realize rather quickly she can‚Äôt fight azula one on one with firebending even though fire bending is korra favorite.  If she uses water bending she may win.  If she fights azula in republic city azula likely wins because azula fights well against earth and fire bending.  Azulas hotter blue flames easily crushes earth defenses and korra would be outclassed in firebending and speed.  Lightning may end up being the difference maker.  But logically if this was to play out on tv from what we saw azula would win unless Korra had another bender to help her like mako.  Mako and Korra wins against azula.  Korra one on one azula loses.
TheLastAirbender,fp323ef,t1_fp1ivms,1588271773.0,Hahaha true this is not naruto where all the bad guys have a sad backstory and need redemption your right I guess
TheLastAirbender,fp31xn2,t1_fp1jm38,1588271696.0,When we first see azula she‚Äôs a 14 year old girl who for the first time goes out to fight in a war (she did good by the way). Korra fought against masters of the 3 elements and trained very hard as we saw.  Fighting was very easy for Korra she just was too emotional as a fighter unlike the master manipulator azula. Also korra would fight to kill.  Azula would be a perfect match up.  Yeah azula may be more experienced but your underestimated Korra
TheLastAirbender,fp31hl6,t1_fp1jz8c,1588271481.0,"I disagree.  KORRa WAS TRAINED BY THE WHITE LOTUS AND KATARA.  She was a prodigy by 4 and very powerful.  Imagine azula coming across a blood bender.  Azula with one element is equal to korras three elements, yes. But she would not pulverize her and win from outsmarting her not outclassing her."
TheLastAirbender,fp312tv,t1_fp1n4lt,1588271280.0,"This really just shows how she moves way slower and less evasive then azula.  Korra is arguably stronger but it‚Äôs hard for me to picture Korra landing a decisive blow.  Azula will you with her, trick her, KORRA WAS SHOWN TO BE KIND OF AN AIRHEAD WHO WOULD LET HER EMOTIONS PREVENT HER FROM WINNING.  We have also seen Korra tire and run out of energy during fighting.  Not the case with azula."
TheLastAirbender,fp30npx,t1_fp1pad4,1588271070.0,Azula is definitely above Korra even though Korra has shown great power and skill.  Just because Korra has multiple elements at her side doesn‚Äôt help if your fighting an elite skilled bender.  Unalaq only had one element but was so skilled he was able to take on multiple benders of various elements with MINIMAL water.  Azula is just like this in the fact she is so strong in her respected are she would be able to fight against avatars and give them a run for the money.
TheLastAirbender,fp30aas,t1_fp1nsyq,1588270887.0,"Azula is stronger firebender and her fire does far far more damage than Korra but Korra is not too far behind her in terms of skill of firebending.  I‚Äôve saw Korra charge up her fire attacks often, blazing opponents with charged attacks that would last over 5 seconds of fire stream charged a feat only zuko, azula, ozai, and sozin were seen doing.  I would say because her firebending at that time was stronger or atleast equal to zuko, korra earthbending and waterbending (SHE WAS TRAINED BY WHITE LOTUS MASTERS AND KATARA) she would win.  Azula would be able to evade most of the attacks and make korra angry and make korra use most of her energy rampaging then azula will go in for kill.  Tough battle but ultimately season 1 Korra wins."
TheLastAirbender,fp2zair,t1_fp1p763,1588270406.0,True.  She‚Äôs more aggressive but aangs evasiveness was on par with azula.  And evasiveness is the strongest feat in fighting because we see the likes of aang and azula evade almost every single attack of the enemy.  Korra is powerful season 1 but she‚Äôs more grounded and more likely to take hits head on.
TheLastAirbender,fp2yyta,t1_fp25fpd,1588270248.0,Exactly this.  Most versions of azula are very similar.  The mental break down is the only difference and the argument is that maybe her fight strategy is not as cunning but arguably she‚Äôs just as powerful maybe even more deadly because of her rage and we all know firebenders used that method of firebending back then.
TheLastAirbender,fp2yntz,t1_fp1zkv5,1588270099.0,Korra was shown to be a powerful firebender during practice in season one. She was able to shoot streams of fire that was charged and she was able to hold fire attack streams for over 5 seconds of just endless fire.  It‚Äôs possible she‚Äôs not to far below azula in terms of firebending and she could overwhelm azula with earth and water.  Now that I think of it Korra should win this battle because Korra will fight to kill UNLIKE aang.
TheLastAirbender,fp2y0ku,t1_fp201rr,1588269782.0,"Yes exactly.  Korra is actually very good just look at the people she was forced to fight against.  A extremely powerful blood bender who uses his mind to fight, an ozai version of water bending named unalaq who was also an avatar, zaheer and kuvira elite benders.  If aang matched up against these people during the last air bender he would win against only unalaq and zaheer and it still wouldn‚Äôt be easy for him.  Korra would but up a good fight against azula."
TheLastAirbender,fp2xbmh,t1_fp2dm06,1588269447.0, Because once she has total access to the avatar state by season 2 azula loses very easily.
TheLastAirbender,fp1icqn,t3_gas0ry,1588236529.0,korra with no avatar state and no air bending like how she was in season one. My guess is that Azula would be a more powerful bender than korra at that point and ultimately wins against korra.
TheLastAirbender,fp1hgff,t1_fozaxdw,1588235663.0,He already had his bending taken away and maybe zuko can teach him to be kind and iroh visit him on biweekly bases share tea with him and help him.  Without his bending he was no longer a threat.
TheLastAirbender,foz5wz7,t3_gaer57,1588185221.0,I would hope maybe he gets out sometime after changing his ways.
northkorea,foo8rr3,t3_g8gx3y,1587934711.0,Thank God.  He‚Äôs that character that even though he‚Äôs evil him not being in that seat of power will destabilize the whole world.  Please keep this man alive for the sake of long term progression with North Korea.
TheLastAirbender,fo03ynd,t1_fnywfgj,1587405667.0,You are wrong in everything you said.  You have to match them up individually.  You don‚Äôt understand matchups.
TheLastAirbender,fo03cww,t1_fnyw7bh,1587405364.0,"I don‚Äôt know about overrated when they were almost never bested in all matchups they participated on screen.  Idk about hype when Iroh did things other firebenders were never seen doing like redirecting natural and created lighting.  He also easily defeated armies of dai li agents when his main intention was to escape or hold off the enemy, never trying to outright kill them.  Also without the knowledge Iroh had ozai would of killed aang with lightning.  It‚Äôs only because Iroh taught zuko and zuko taught aang redirection that aang was able to save his own life.  Iroh can redirect firebending shown when he deflected firebending attacks against the rough rhinos captain.  Meaning during sozins comet he can deflect all sozins comet enhanced firebending.  He was extremely quick for his size and age and he‚Äôs not even in his prime so imagine him 20 years before the show.  He‚Äôs not overrated but I do wish we could of seen more fights from him like a backstory 3 episode series.  Obviously toph is not overrated most earthbenders you match her against she crushes."
TheLastAirbender,fo02i4m,t1_fnyhogh,1587404935.0,Yes she does seem to be a mutant firebender because of the stronger blue flames.  Even during sozins comet Iroh nor Ozai we‚Äôre capable of compressing fire to create blue flames.  Imagine if the fireball Iroh shot at the outer wall was a blue fireball or atleast the edges of the flames to make it look destructive.  She‚Äôs a prodigy but also a mutant in the way combustion man was .  Zuko is a mutant firebender also because in the comics he was seen using several different colors of fire (I wish the comics did not do that because even in the legend of Korra is fire was only orange.  Yes because she was a mutant prodigy firebender she would of surpassed both Ozai and Iroh.  Meaning Azula was best suited to defeat a prime toph because her flames would easily destroy tophs earth ending and even without fighting she evades like an air bender.  We saw what yakone did to prime toph but that‚Äôs another conversation.
TheLastAirbender,fnyf2pr,t1_fnyecy7,1587361205.0,I really like the way you analyzed it and yes he knew he would definitely overkill if he went full force.  Iroh and ozai are children of azulon from what we know an extremely powerful bender.  I believe like you stated he would be able to kill her at the time of ATLA but even by 2-3years in the comics she would be on par with a declining iroh by the time she was 16-17 and him older after the war.  It‚Äôs amazing she was white lotus tier at 12.  How I wish the show would of gave us a toph vs azula 1 on 1.  In other words iroh could of taken each individual of the gaang by the end of the war before aang reunlocked the avatar state.
TheLastAirbender,fnye0j6,t1_fny8ve2,1587360344.0,"You made a lot of valid points.  We do not get to see toph fight top skilled firebenders often mostly earthbenders and the times she came into contact with skilled ones it wasn‚Äôt the same.  Zuko barely did anything and burned tophs feet and she was helpless.  Lightning works great against earth, remember when azula was chasing toph and the gaang and she shot lightning at tophs earth wall and toph looked horrified.  The episode when they were traveling to ba sing se.  azula was shown to be extremely agile and to expose weaknesses fairly quickly.  Even during the day of black sun the earthbenders including toph could not touch her.  I completely disagree with your statement that aang was unbeatable during The comet.  Aang was not a fully realized avatar and would be the weaker bender of the two during the comet.  It makes the most sense that iroh would be the only one to stop him.  Even if his power levels are below ozai.  He is powerful and skilled able to deflect fire attacks etc.  during his fight with aang he wouldn‚Äôt perfectly make him hit his back against that rock triggering the avatar state thus it would be iroh heavy offensive attacks until aang tired enough for iroh to strike him.  It makes sense for iroh to be able to defeat aang at this point because even two years after the war he would of superseded irohs ability.  You may be right on katara not using blood bending against him.  The way I see iroh ending toph is after an exchange of words be the first person to attack, force her to be defensive and create earth shields of some nature and iroh shooting lightning through it when her guard is down.  But again I want to emphasize aang was not unapproachable.  Azula nearly killed him many times without comet access and none of aangs offensive moves would be enough to kill iroh."
TheLastAirbender,fny67uw,t1_fny4aly,1587354404.0,I feel that toph could beat him because of the particular matchup but you have to agree Azula and ozai would be able to take her.
anime,fnxv5sr,t1_fnxti2m,1587347010.0,Ok sir your right I‚Äôm wrong I‚Äôm sorry.  I‚Äôll be more mindful ü§™
TheLastAirbender,fnxuvsb,t3_g4juqj,1587346834.0,"I‚Äôve been going over battles iroh would win and lose.  
1.)Iroh vs Ozai during sozins comet, Ozai WINS
2.)Iroh vs aang during sozins comet, Iroh WINS
3.)Iroh vs master pakku northern water tribe full moon, master pakku WINS
4.)Iroh vs Bumi Omashu, Bumi WINS
5.)Iroh vs Azula sozins comet, Iroh WINS
6.)Iroh vs Katara in the earth kingdom Catacombs, Iroh WINS
7.)Iroh vs katara full moon, katara WINS via bloodbending 
I just can‚Äôt decide if he would win against toph.  Azula and ozai would win against her because they would spend a lot of time in the air thus making toph blind to their attacks.  They could also zap her with lightning and both would be able to realize if they burn toph feet it‚Äôs over.  Iroh is less likely to use lightning and he fights more on the ground and she would easily detect all his movements.  However Iroh is a quick offensive fighter and very dangerous any input would help thanks"

I‚Äôve been trying not to overly think, plan a written agenda each day so I can check things off.  I‚Äôve stopped listening to music because it is more of a distraction and certain music can profoundly impact your mood like love songs, sad songs, rap songs about money etc. our minds shouldn‚Äôt operate on these things all the time.  Trying to get more balanced sleeping patterns and sleeping enough hours.  Thinking of things from a weekly and day to day basis rather than 30 year perspective.  Mastering the day is so important to me because I waste so many days away.  I‚Äôve been lonely for a while so I‚Äôve been working on being my own best friend and my own counsel instead of reaching out.  I‚Äôve tried to be more out of body and act as my own assistant so that I‚Äôm like a sim from the sims game.  Like how we control the sims from above that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm trying to control myself.  Also trying to improve my health habits like drinking water eating fruits and vegetables.  Try numbing yourself out first so that your emotions are in line with reality.  It‚Äôs okay to randomly cry by yourself as a relief.  Tears may fall down without no real reaction but it still feels good to just let it out for the reasons you feel.  Then to gather oneself and carry on .  I‚Äôm going to try to start meditating soon.  I want to also start going to the beach and quiet hikes and do some worldly thinking.  If you can smile in the face of your misery and tell yourself I will be the conqueror of my own self doubt.  Even though this world is a mean sick place our own reflection is our great enemy.  Just knowing that each day is a quiet battle means I have a reason to fight even when I just don‚Äôt want to.  In the end we will all perish so if we want to die someday we don‚Äôt have to worry lol.  Just making the best of this life we are forced to be apart of and acknowledging that for some people sadness is apart of the living experience.  Some people are lucky to always be so happy and perfect and have everything.  People like me and you have to be soldiers and try to hold our heads high.  I hope someday you don‚Äôt just find temporary happiness but an everlasting peace within your own spirit.  My wish to be fully at peace with the mind.  Good luck my friend."

depression,fipn255,t3_f961g6,1582612440.0,It‚Äôs like we are living the same life.  I came here thinking the same thing about just wanting to die as a college student in computer science.  I keep telling myself to just see it through and if life gets too bad then I‚Äôll off myself. Just hang in there one day at a time
depression,fipmy2e,t3_f95y1i,1582612314.0,I understand your view and sadly many of us are like that.  I‚Äôm so toxic I stay away from people so they don‚Äôt have to be apart of it.

Boruto,fh758x3,t3_f169z6,1581315604.0,"First of all, I want to say this was an amazing episode and an amazing arc.  Benga is badass a real scary antagonist while also not being completely unstoppable.  I was happy when he noticed things about boruto.  The red head guy was obviously the suspect but I was still wondering to the end how it would play out.  The quiet guy who mitsuki bonded with was awesome and that punch was nice.  I like to see the setting so dark and boruto not so privileged like he is treated in the leaf. His is a prisoner and acts as such.  Also we all know mitsuki is Lorde orochimarus son and his intellect is second to none which makes everything so believable with his detective skills. We also know the leaf shinobi can use jutsu if it came down to it which helps me not get to worried about them.  I like how the figure head still controls Benga and side note, it‚Äôs awesome we never see his eyes like we don‚Äôt see shinos eyes super badass.  These shinobi are following through with their mission and I‚Äôm excited to see what happens next!"
depression,fh6ehw6,t3_f1imlw,1581297928.0,"Since you know you can end it all now you should find a way to live for anything you can possibly look forward too.  You should eat your favorite foods, travel places you want to go, sit on a beach if that‚Äôs therapeutic to you.  Yes your life probably means nothing, it‚Äôs probably boring but even the smallest thing in the days can make your life worth it.  You may look forward to a favorite tv show each week or maybe running into a certain someone from time to time can make you happy.  If you need a joint of weed from time to time, think about trying that.  If you don‚Äôt have anyone meaningful BE THAT MEANINGFUL PERSON TO YOURSELF.  Life is subjective, we can always change our thinking. I‚Äôm not saying pretend to be happy but even in the darkest moments you can save yourself with positive reenforcement.  If you don‚Äôt know what to do just start doing random stuff until meaning comes to you.  Take long walks and just talk to yourself.  Be the peace you seek.  If you want to die someday you don‚Äôt have to worry it will happen whether you like it or not, might as well find pleasure in your current existence no matter how small or big."
depression,fh69dhy,t1_fh67ntr,1581296389.0,"Exactly,  I‚Äôve accepted the fact that in this moment in time I‚Äôm the loser and it can‚Äôt be helped.  However, I‚Äôm taking long term steps like going to school, saving money and investing, and trying to become more healthier.  I‚Äôll have so much self love for myself.  At least I could be maybe be a rich loser hahaha.  But yeah that inner voice can actually be used for a lot of good things and not just the demons"
