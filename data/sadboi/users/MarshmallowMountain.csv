AskReddit,f7jfakv,t3_dw84zi,1573776389.0,"I was driving home from the next city over on a highway (about 45 minute drive) and less than a third of the way there it started snowing heavily and the ground was covered fairly quickly. I could see pretty far and I drove about 30-40 mph. There were trucks tailgating me but fuck them, I'm not dying. And it's a good thing I felt that way.

A truck that had been stopped at an intersection suddenly pulled out in front of me, and I hit my brakes, but it didn't do anything. I remember thinking, ""Oh god, oh no. I'm not slowing down. I'm not slowing down. I'm going to hit him!"" Everything seemed to slow down. My immediate reaction was to honk to let everyone know I couldn't stop and shit was about to go down, even though that was probably obvious.

 Then I looked to my left where the cones were at, blocking the left lane. I remember seeing them when I was originally going to the city. The road was finished, they just hadn't pulled the cones yet. It was safe there. I swerved into it, my tires slipping, managing to miss the truck ahead of me by mere inches. Now I was sideways, sliding at maybe 30 mph down the road and past the truck. Somehow I didn't leave the road and was going down it still (this confuses me the most when I think about it). I looked out my passenger side window and turned my wheel towards the direction I wanted to go. As my car righted itself, I turned my wheel with it, remembering a video I had just watched two days prior on YouTube on what to do when your car is slipping on ice. Once I was straightened, I just coasted in the lane, breathing heavily. As I slowed down, the truck that had pulled out in front of me went past. He stared straight ahead, didn't make eye contact at all. Eventually one of the other trucks that had been following me slowed down to let me in. I had never felt so terrified in my life. It still makes me a bit uncomfortable. I should have been driving more slowly, I think."
