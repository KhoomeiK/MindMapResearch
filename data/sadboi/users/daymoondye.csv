And the melody is not false too. And more than that, you can play guitar too. That's cool! Good luck and hope you gain more confidence!"
confidence,fj3e2a4,t3_fbby25,1582980282.0,"Wow, I can relate to this post (about singing, I mean). My voice is also soft and can't compete with others. I only sing in church and choir in university. I can say that I don't have a good basics. I love to sing too. And I know that singing can relieve stress, especially karaoke. I also upload several covers on youtube, but stopped last year. 

I'm sorry I told you about myself too much. But the thing is you are not alone :) If singing give you happiness, just do it without thinking what others feel. There is a hope that people recognize your ability. I will also check your channel! :) Good luck!"

Actually I have gone to psychiatrist in the past, maybe 3 years ago. He gave me advice and medication to stop overthinking. But then, my symptoms were not as bad as last year and this year.
I feel that what I told him was just the same as what I told normal people (as in my friends, family)."
depression_help,et5cwmr,t1_et5ckhp,1562470177.0,Okay. Then what should I do after that?

But I think I actually have the ability to gone through all those. So I hope you keep believing in yourself."
