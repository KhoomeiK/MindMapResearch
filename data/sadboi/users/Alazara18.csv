I hurts me more though when you feel like you fit in for a short time then something changes and you’re back being a part of the back ground. That no matter how hard you try to push forward or get “out of your comfort zone”, it doesn’t seem to matter."

To each their own for what they do in the bedroom as long as it isn’t hurting someone but if it’s not something you’re into than you shouldn’t do it for your other. Plus she should be a bit nicer about her approach, nobody likes to be called “butchy”

For her to look for someone at Pride, is just tasteless and lazy. There are places set up for couples to find someone to bang with no commitment (which is what it sounds like).

I’d also ask have you talked to her about how it makes you feel when she says things like that? Cause if you’re friendship matter then you need to be open and honest with her."
