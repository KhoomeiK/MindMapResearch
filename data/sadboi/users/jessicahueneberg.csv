AmItheAsshole,fnjx71n,t1_fnjw7wt,1587009136.0,"I wrote a whole paragraph about how doctors, nurses, and the hospital will pressure new moms to breastfeed. I ended up erasing it before posting because I was worried about people taking it the wrong way. It was crazy how much it was assumed every new mom wants and can breastfeed. 

One lady told me that once I start breastfeeding I would not ever want to stop- like I would be sad to stop at like 18 months. I shut her down real fast and told her I doubt I would ever have that problem. Now that I went through all the stress and pain of trying to breastfeed I don’t think I would ever feel like I want to breastfeed after the kiddo starts eating solids or talking or whatever."
AmItheAsshole,fnjw053,t1_fnjv2mc,1587008313.0,My kid didn’t latch and the pressure in the hospital was crazy because he was losing weight from not eating. So I had to supplement while trying to breast feed with a breast shield on- it took two people to feed my son and it was just not doable long term. Thanks to hormones I would break down crying daily because I felt I was a failure as a mother (I realize I am not logically but damn those hormones after giving birth meds you up!).

She was my soulmate and I cried extremely hard nightly a long time after she passed. I would hear noises that I would swear were her only to realize she could not have made them.

AmItheAsshole,flo5b8d,t1_flmramv,1585331884.0,I relate to this so much! I am pumping every three hours for maybe 10 milliliters each breast. I bought herbal supplements that I am waiting for to help produce milk but because of the Covid 19 I am not expecting them to arrive any time soon.
AmItheAsshole,flmlero,t1_flmjayy,1585287255.0,"Omg, I can relate to this so much! I can’t breast feed (flat nipples-who knew?!) so I am pumping but my supply is **maybe** four oz a day from both boobs. I feel constant guilt about not being able to produce enough to keep my new baby fed. 

On top of this I am sleep deprived and trying to learn how to be a mother as I go. I also am constantly trying to determine whether the reasons I am crying and anxious is because of baby blues or if I am dealing with postpartum depression. If this was not enough let’s add a Fucking pandemic on top of giving birth! Us new moms are stressing about keeping ourselves and our infants healthy despite having to go to the doctor for after birth check ups. 

Finally, OP is recovering from surgery!!! I had my c section the first week of March and had to deal with the surgery site pain, my boobs engorging, and the swelling in my legs that made walking extremely painful. 

I could not imagine having to deal with slighted insults from my mother while going through all this. I would have to go no contact if I was a OP for my own mental health. I really hope OP can find support from friends and family during this time."

Formula is also hit and miss. I unfortunately am not making enough breast milk so I have to add formula to my less than one month old’s diet. We try to buy as much as we can when we find it on the shelves because we don’t know if it will available the next shopping trip.

First, I would get a lock for my door. Just got to Walmart or Home Depot and switch out the knobs. Make sure to keep the original knob and change it back out for before your lease ends. 

Second, I would send a email to your roommate and let them know all of your devices have been removed from your internet router. Let them know if they do not restore access within x amount of days you will not contribute to that bill at all going forward and you will prorate this month only paying for the time you were able to use the WiFi/internet. I would screen shot any time/device that you are denied permission to and attach them to an email in which you cc yourself. Also check out your lease to see if access to internet is included in the contract. If so and your roommate is blocking access, loop in your landlord. Make sure to save all contacts with your roommate. 

Best of luck."
