GPs aren't able to fully diagnose the majority of mental disorders outside of anxiety and depression so your best option would be to ask for a referral to a psychiatrist/psychologist and speak about it with them instead as they are more likely to take into consideration what you're saying."

Yes, yes, YES. This is exactly how it is for me right now, almost as if everything is on his terms and his terms only. I'm just scared to let go fully because when he was gone I missed him every single day.

It will be painful for a while but you'll get there. Try and keep the negatives in mind, that helped me somewhat."

Let me tell you, it's been absolute fucking hell since he's been back, a lot of old feelings have resurfaced and I've fallen back into the big ol' attachment hole.

If you already know that your life will be better without them then go ahead, it will be difficult but also the best decision you could make."
