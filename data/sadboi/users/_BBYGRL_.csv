Here’s an article on the smell of rain
https://www.compoundchem.com/2014/05/14/thesmellofrain/

Also it isn’t JUST the water, it’s mostly what happens before it rains and the sounds it makes or smell it makes, things have to react to things to create chemicals"
otherkringe,foioaov,t1_foinhfy,1587791926.0,"Pretty sure it’s a bit more complex than that, rain releases chemicals which release chemicals in your brain and rain also just releases chemicals and your brain can also just release chemicals when it rains, but it has been proven to be calming.

And yes other POC shouldn’t silence you either, ESPECIALLY when they have nothing to do with hispanic communities. Even though they usually talk from more personal experience and/or if they are Korean are explaining their culture or defending it, there’s no excuse for silencing the people that can actually get hurt by this stuff. A debate is okay and often necessary, but some people have a more valid opinion than others."
KpopUnpopularOpinions,foij8ii,t1_foh58z3,1587788005.0,"Totally agreed, I love seeing our culture spread and be represented if it is in a respectful way, and anyone can weigh in on the matter, but the way non hispanic people think this issue lays in their hands and how they overpower POC in these issues normally, wether it’s to protect them or to say they’re being dramatic, is worse than almost anything some kpop group can come out with"
CPTSD,foh8p6z,t3_g79971,1587761892.0,"I have the exact same issue!

KpopUnpopularOpinions,fog76ft,t3_g7ahpa,1587748800.0,"I’m Hispanic and I get pretty hyped any time I see them use it, but sometimes it can be pretty questionable though. Even though I really like g-idle’s señorita and uh-oh I get the uproar about their music. As long as people learn about the culture and use it respectfully I have no issue with them using it, but this is a discussion the hispanic community should be having mostly. Non Hispanic people can have opinions, but when they straight up say that it is or is not cultural appropriation they are talking over the voices that actually matter in this issue. That is the worst part to me, not wether it is or isn’t cultural appropriation but how I almost only see non-hispanic people in the discussion and how they always over power the voices of Hispanic people wether they think it’s cultural appropriation or not. It’s a very intricate issue you see, most people have mixed thoughts on it so it’s pretty hard to put it in a black or white light anyways

Edit: personally I usually really like it and don’t consider the music cultural appropriation, can’t stand cringey use of Spanish words though but also I love it when they do that so idk. But the issue is deeper than just the music"

I had so much stomach aches that I couldn’t take my swimming lessons or go to school and I always thought I was just sick. Then again I was also physically sick quite often. It was horrible, I have mostly other physical issues right now and way less bad ones but they annoy me so much. Sometimes I won’t even be anxious in my head but I can feel my shoulders tensing and my breathing getting harder and harder or my heart beating so fast, for no goddamn reason. I once ate a really hot pepper whole just for fun (I’m quite good with hot food) but this one was so hot it made my body get some of the things I get when I get panic attacks, and then I got a full on panic attack for no goddamn reason.
