assassinscreed,fiywxrl,t3_fa4klb,1582848851.0,"I honestly dont know where they will go. Vikings sounds fun and I can feel a god of war inspired game, but mechanics but in the games look. I would love to see a world war situation maybe germany taking down the nazi regime. Personally I wanna see a more modern version of the game, seeing what crazy things they can come up with. Maybe the bolshevik revolution would be a good era to tackle. Civi war could be good as well and they could implement a choose a side mechanic where they have two separate stories depending on which side you want to be on."
assassinscreed,fiyw34y,t3_faa9p4,1582848279.0,"I personally love both and cant pick. They both meet in the middle. I’d say origins has a bigger open world and more to do and in black flag its a lot of open water but the ship battles are fun and good. Story wise I fell in love with black flag, the ending had me super sad and the song makes me nostalgic with how beautiful it is performed. Upgrading both games are super good, the boat upgrades made me feel stronger and the upgrades to bayek made me feel stronger as well."
assassinscreed,fiyvqw1,t3_faaybn,1582848055.0,When the Notre Dame burnt down they released the game for free as a reference for recreation and a tribute to it. It has a fun multiplayer feature that personally made the game super fun for me and my friends. I don’t remember much from the game but the experience I had was what made the game for me
assassinscreed,fiyveuq,t3_faj5a3,1582847837.0,Original reason they took the finger off was in Origins Bayek accidentally gets that finger chopped off by hid hidden blade and I guess to make them unique and stand out and easy to identify to a known assassin and I guess to show loyalty to the cause.
assassinscreed,fiyuz2t,t3_falbns,1582847547.0,I played it in 2019 as well as the other one who said they did and mine was on pc. There are a couple frustrating mechanics in the game. I like all the games even the ones people think are bad. Lock picking was the worst thing in the game by far. The game is good and is worth a play if you want too try it out.
assassinscreed,fiyus1a,t3_fabks5,1582847420.0,"For me the fun of the game was getting side tracked and being able to do what I want relatively when I wanted too. Kind of like Zelda BOTW, you can do whatever whenever you want besides story missions"

Then two seconds later its confirmed and we get a pretty badass vader showing how strong he actually is. And just the mere thought cal got away made me go “LOL NOPE”. Voice acting was almost on point for Vader. Im glad they just threw him in for a surprise, like damn. I wanted more planets to explore and side missions would be nice instead just explore and get these little collectables like some nice like stealth missions or nice like space fights. Don’t get me wrong i love exploring for the hell of it but having to jump from place to place and with one objective find the temple. Like I want more environment with fun areas like on Zeffo with the fallen ship just being able to be explored. And give me more imperial action, like invade a star destroyer. Or infiltrate the in progress death star and steal some information needed or rescue force sensitive kids or rebel parties."

So this morning I got zero sleep and decided to play my switch and it showed my switch icon in the bottom right as unconnected on the right but the left one was connected. I disconnected them and it worked fine, later it happened again and disconnecting didn’t fix it and it took awhile to pair. And has paired but the worse thing is I cant play games unless I use the controller and if I try to play games with it docked thinks im undocked when in reality it is docked in. 
It also doesnt make the click sound and disconnecting it earlier fixed it but now it wont fix it.
 Anyone got a fix for it???"

But there are people who generally care. Sometimes people don’t show it directly. Your parents dont sound the best but you are a teenager, tell them. Tell them you feel like a nothing to them and if they actually love you they’d care about you. If they don’t and shrug it off tell a trusted family member or hell call child protective services, if they are that bad. You are alive for an unknown purpose. We all are. It takes till the end of our lives to find out what we were here for. We all have impacts to make and dont cut yourself off from that. You’ll never live again, there is norespawn that we know of. Don’t bet you’ll just live a new life without knowing what happened. You’ll miss out on all the memories you could have made, and trust me.. as an 18 year old and im not some fucking wise guy im just saying the memories you make are so fucking precious cause only you can hold them.

You have values you want seen and she doesn’t meet them, but I’d say, just be friends that way she is somewhat satisfied in being close to you. Also just let her know you aren’t interested but aren’t quite sure yet"

 I figured this out for my anxiety, I had a huge senior project so obv anxiety was high. I told my parents “okay so I’ve seen im more productive in the morning so, im going to skip the day before my senior presentation to work on it and be relaxed as possible.” And personally it helped so fucking much!
