relationship_advice,fnpcgpr,t1_fnpbu02,1587143072.0,So I’ve already had a go at her. But she’s quite cold. She has apologised but not with any heart. Almost like when a my sister might have to say sorry to me so my parents don’t confiscate her phone.
relationship_advice,fnpbn6p,t1_fnpb6sk,1587142660.0,"Thing is, I’m not a person with a tonne of friends and I only keep a few close ones around. I’ve know her for my whole life and I can’t imagine cutting her off."
Drugs,flyv857,t1_fly22nl,1585609779.0,Woah 1.5g sounds absolutely nuts! Do you lose your appetite afterwards? My friend has lost tonnes of weight over the last few months (since she started taking mdma on a reg).
Drugs,flyuqro,t1_fly2gtr,1585609502.0,Thanks for the advice! I’m not bothered about looking cool I wanna do it for myself but if that means waiting another year or so for the best outcome I’m fine with that. + I’m not only any meds. My parents are pretty cool they said they’d do it with me the first time when they approve of my age. Would the setting: with my parents at home prolly or my friends at a rave/festival make all the difference?
depression,fci0quy,t3_eh8oqh,1577656383.0,Im half Indian half white and this is totally my (Indian) mum’s attitude. It rlly bugs me and she somehow thinks it’s ok to make this kind of point.
Anxietyhelp,fbw824p,t1_fbtvi7a,1577143056.0,Thanks for the advice! I guess I could be dehydrated. I’ll make an extra effort to drink more water. This has been going on almost everyday for 2 months. My panic attacks are happening a lot less but I keep getting rlly dizzy now.
Anxiety,fbsr0lu,t1_fbk7o68,1577059046.0,That’s nice to hear. Living is on its way up for me :) I’ve stopped isolating myself from my friends!
Anxiety,fb5bees,t3_ebagb9,1576524520.0,"Honestly your high is dependant on the strain. I was fine smoking strong strains but I’ve become very anxious recently and I’ve found that hash is way better if you are an anxious person. It zens you out and makes u feel sleepy and as it’s not got as much of a high THC so you’re less likely to freak out. Also if you do freak out the best thing to do is watch TV- preferably a comedy, it’s easier to turn your high around then. Communicating with your brothers at the time would have helped you. When I was way too high my fellow stoner friend was great at reassuring me and I managed to calm down. :)"
Anxiety,fb0ug7h,t1_fb0ok8p,1576429378.0,"I totally get you. If you’ve been asked to go hang out with the same people for New Year celebration then they obviously like you and you have nothing to worry about! It’s likely you aren’t the only one there thinking this now, birthday parties bring ppl who aren’t necessarily close/friends together which may feel awkward but don’t let yourself dwell on this."
Anxiety,fasrn4g,t1_fasqkjp,1576330567.0,I see. Maybe exercise? I was trying to stay afloat by running. If my anxiety got bad I would just go running. But I kinda gave up on that tbh especially cuz if it made me a bit dizzy my anxiety would get worse. Or colouring? My cousin has OCD and used tb depressed and she rlly loved colouring.
Anxiety,faskxrp,t1_fase8tj,1576328450.0,"Well I decided to start saying yes more. So today I’m meeting friends actually. I’m a bit of a try hard so in my free time Id usually do homework/revise or go for a run. And if I’m not in the mood for any of that, which I haven’t been recently I’ll just watch a lot of TV. Wbu?"
Anxiety,fascfly,t1_fas91hk,1576325971.0,Totally relate. I think the trick is to stop waiting or fixing the problem and just kinda act like it’s not there. I’ve isolated myself from most of my friends to make me feel better but it’s now part of the problem.
Anxiety,fas2pj3,t1_faryrbn,1576322820.0,Yes. I feel like I can’t be productive till I feel normal and yes like I need to be fixed before moving on. I spend everyday fighting anxiety that I can’t do other things.
Anxiety,farfcr4,t1_fapzcg5,1576315483.0,Samesies. I feel like I don’t know who I am anymore. My anxiety is due to a fairly traumatic event and I feel like it’s irreversibly changed me. And because of the nature of this event I’ve now realised many of my friends are quite shallow and not people I want to be around anymore. I’ve really become I different person and I want to feel like me again. I would rather be ignorant to my friends doing stupid things for popularity tbh.
Anxiety,fare1f8,t1_faq2bto,1576315078.0,Well I’ve been putting off seeing friends big time and I’ve missed out on loads of parties. Before my anxiety started I basically partied every weekend and then all of a sudden I stopped. I’ve also been putting off homework and other minor tasks like cleaning my room cuz I think I can do these things better when I feel better.
Anxiety,fapd525,t1_fap8sq3,1576285848.0,Yess. The only person harming u is u. So why shouldn’t u take control right
Anxiety,fap2h5w,t1_fap1lgb,1576278224.0,Exactly! I’m sort of having this revelation. I feel like my eyes have now been opened in a way. From now on I’m just going to act like I don’t have anxiety and CAN do anything and everything :))
introvert,fahu2v4,t3_e90ks5,1576093511.0,Omg I really relate to this. It used to make me feel so uncomfortable!!
Anxietyhelp,fahtsfz,t1_fahro4y,1576093340.0,"Fair enough, I see what u mean. Training masks look so spooky tho ngl"
Anxietyhelp,fahppmg,t1_fahhbtw,1576090871.0,Thanks for the advice!¡ But how would a training mask help?
Anxietyhelp,fa79138,t1_fa5zzkr,1575832570.0,"I don’t have much choice as the waiting lists are this long pretty much everywhere unless I go private. I’d love to go private but it’s my parents paying for it. I do have some prescribed vertigo tablets but after reading the list of potential side affects I freaked. I do cross country training twice a week usually but I haven’t felt well enough to go recently. Another thing is I’ve noticed my worst panic attacks have occurred when I’m alone and I tend to start pacing around my house. What should I try and do. Sitting down and watching TV isn’t usually a possibility at this point, I just feel like I need to do something. 

Also, when I freak out, objects or whatever keep growing large and then shrinking and then like spinning and it rlly spooks me. Can a panic attack rlly do that?"
braces,fa3ucri,t3_e7ixe6,1575797824.0,Everyone w braces should embrace them like this!
Anxietyhelp,fa3s8rj,t1_fa14sr6,1575797243.0,Thanks for the advice. And yes I talked to my doctor and I’m on a waiting list for therapy but looks like I’m gna b waiting 6+ months. I don’t know how to help myself in the mean time.
Anxietyhelp,f9zr727,t1_f9zp2q3,1575744599.0,Thank you so much for the reply! I’m so scared I don’t know what to expect w all this.
AskDocs,f9eg3u1,t1_f9e9r1e,1575243694.0,But could the anxiety really cause the mucus in my throat? I’m overall v confused
