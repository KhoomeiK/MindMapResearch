I spent time in therapy working on why I needed one BEST friend and why I couldn’t find happiness in enjoying different parts of different friendships for what they were. It was still disappointing.

Fast forward many years, traumas, and therapy sessions later and it turns out doing more to understand and support myself has created a life and cultivated friendships that make me feel fulfilled & valued. I have incredible, CLOSE friendships with several people that feel more like family than friends. I am even given a hard time for having so many “BEST” friends.

Socialism_101,f6vo64o,t1_f6sueb7,1573192915.0,"What if the grades were based on how our current system and capital gains work? 

What if all NEW students started out with a 0 and were able to gain points to their grade by working hard and completing assignments, each giving them a few points to their total grade. 

But any students who had parents attend the school got to start off with whatever their parents grades were when they graduated? Let's say they get -10 points for ""inheritance tax"" but they definitely don't start from 0. Already legacy students are at an advantage because they have so many fewer assignments to complete to gain a passing grade.

But let's not stop there - let's include capital gains: Good grades indicate that you are smart and study! So higher grades deserve more credit! For every 10 points to your overall grade you reach, you get an extra 2 points added per 10 points to congratulate you on being so studious! So, if you earn a grade of a 20, you automatically get a 24. A grade of 60 automatically earns you a 72. And a 90 would propel you to a 108! Wow, look at you! You're so smart you exceeded the top grade!

Some students are struggling to pass but my parents did well enough in school so I got to start off with a 70, which meant I automatically got an 84 after my first assignment. But I'm smart! I worked hard on that one assignment! I deserve credit for it! And now I have a 108.

Your parents didn't go to this school so you started out with a 0. You have been working diligently, studying every night, completing every assignment. But you've done 20 assignments and have only been able to earn a grade of a 24. You got some bonus points! But they're minimal. At this rate, you're never going to pass.

You petition the student council to change the system. “Work harder!” They tell you. “Stop blaming the kids who have A's for working hard! Just study more! Changing the system would only serve to deincentivize hard work!”"
