What all CPTSD has in common is the lack of sense of belonging to a community, a home, a sense that you can trust others to look after your interest and not feel like you have to fight or defend yourself every moment of your life. First, can you give yourself the love you want from others? Or have self-compassion, love you as you are, without needing to do anything else? I've been struggling with this issue all my life, I feel like I need somebody else in order to be loved. Still working on this issue. Self-acceptance is the first step to self-compassion.

Everyone is responsible for their own feeling if he tells you that you are responsible for his, he is manipulating you. I would look into codependency and talk to a therapist about it. Don't let guilt and shame repeat the cycle of pain of codependency, stay strong, set boundaries, tell him, no one can be responsible for your happiness other than yourself.
