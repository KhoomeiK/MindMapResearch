The key herr is you have to find clubs that suit your style and your music stile, its gonna be a lot harder to progress of the music is thrash to yout ears or the people are just too different, dont fit your style... for insance if you like rock music go to rock concerts or places with rock music, its gonna be a lot harder to relax somewhere where you just dont feel like you belong"
