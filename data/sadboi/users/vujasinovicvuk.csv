177013,eybkxgd,t1_eybj25b,1566986824.0,"Well, the story is about a girl named Saki that wants to make a change to her life and get friends. She changes her look, and changes her attitude. She meats a guy, who's name I have forgotten, and he leads her to his house. Since she never had friends before, she didn't know how to react, so he managed to get her to have sex with him. At the same time, the girls in the school trick her into doing prostitution. When she was with an older man, someone took a picture of the two of them entering a hotel. The word spread and the boys from the school blackmailed her into fucking her and stuff like that. Her dad said that she looked like her mother when she was younger. He raped her and after her mother found out, she didn't allow her to be at the house and ""banished"" her from it. She started living with the guy from the beginning, because they were boyfriend and girlfriend. He gave her tattoos and she dyed her hair. She started doing cocaine and became a prostitute. She once got pregnant and she aborted the baby. The boyfriend had some debts to pay to his drug dealer so she made him money. She then got addicted to heroin. Then, one time, she fucked the drug dealer, and instead of taking money to pay out the debt, she took heroin. Because of that, the boyfriend also ""banished"" her from his home, so she started living in the street. She then got rapped by some to homeless guys and got pregnant again. This time she didn't want to abort, so she kept the baby. She was still doing prostitution so she would get drugs. Then, she managed to get some more money, but she was seen by some people, who raped her and beat her. I think that those people are the people from school, but I'm not sure. She then took one last shot of heroine, and had a dream where she didn't ever meat the guy that was her boyfriend. She then died. 

There is also a version, also written by the same writer, where some character from JoJo's bizarre adventures, who's names I don't know, because I didn't watch the show, come and save her. She then starts a new life."
