If anything it kind of explains why the doctor fit in so poorly as a timelord."
doctorwho,fjacr19,t1_fj87wr2,1583170836.0,"I mean, she's still timelord adjacent. She just came before them, not after. Who knows how much of what the timelords are was taken from her in this gene splicing process. Probably a lot since their physiology is pretty much indistinguishable.

There is something up with the other person, maybe they are stressed or have an anger problem. Maybe they're just not good at dealing with their feelings and expressing themselves.

I'll still be on edge but I won't blame myself for everything and burst into tears, lol."

Peterborough,fhbkzo4,t1_fhbk4nj,1581444429.0,"It was a family friend. Bit of an akward situation. They gave me a lot of notice so I sucked it up. My rent went up nearly $100 (a lot on my income) but I'm happier where I am now anyway. At least until I run out of money, haha!

Anyway, they had a legal reason - they were moving back into the property. Which they did, but then resumed renting. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Peterborough,fhbjkpw,t1_fhbik8j,1581443593.0,"If you read the article, it's not about non-payment evictions. It's about the rise of evictions in general, but also about evictions of questionable legality and the emergence of ""renovictions"" (evicting tenants so you can increase rent).

I have had to move unwillingly twice in Peterborough, once because my landlords were selling and the new landlords were potentially moving in themselves, and the second time it was so the landlord could get a new tenant and raise rent more than the allowed amount.

Both times were technically legal, but also a big financial and emotional burden since my rent increased with each move and in one case the quality of the property decreased. Not to mention the cost/time of the move itself! Being a tenant takes so much power away. üôÅ"
