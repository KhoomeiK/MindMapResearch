Semis have a row of lights over their cab.  If you live in a hilly area, turn your brights off when you see that row of lights instead of waiting to see their headlights.  When they're cresting a hill you're shining your brights in their eyes for far longer before you see their headlights.

They do use *cleats* though.  Can't remember exactly which ones though I do know they're nearly impossible to find."
bicycling,fprljr5,t3_gf118s,1588857040.0,It's exactly what the description says: a generic frame with a single speed fixed/freewheel hub.  They're imported and sold under untold number of names.

Unless you're in Germany you don't want to search for touring bikes as touring bikes elsewhere generally have drop bars.

Search for a hybrid."
bikecommuting,fprj1x3,t3_gf5gbv,1588855389.0,"They come in useful if you're loading and unloading cargo from panniers, and not much else.  They add weight, can damage your frame, and are less stable than leaning your bike against something.

I thought you fixie guys cared about weight, looks and simplicity?  Kickstands are the antithesis of that.

I use a kickstand, so please don't think I'm some kickstand hater.  They're just a lot less useful than you think."

Well, apparently he doesn't understand this variety of pizza.  Knowing the NYC pizza scene doesn't make him a universal pizza expert. 

There are people that would consider OP's pizza underdone for the style.  This is what the regional variation of bar pizza looks like around here: https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/9b55k3/perfected_my_heggies_bake_game/

You and Mr NYC pizza guy may think it looks burnt but that's how it is intended to be served."

That's dried salt.  Either from the brine in the jar, or OP used brine in the airlock. Either way, mold doesn't form crystals."

minnesota,fpoc3uw,t1_fpoawek,1588781975.0,"Well it's a good thing licenses that expired during the shutdown are still valid, isn't it?

>>Gov. Walz signed a bill into law March 28 that provides an extension for Minnesotans whose driver's licenses or ID cards expire during the peacetime emergency. 

>>The law extends the expiration date for any valid driver's license, instruction permit, provisional license, operator's permit, limited license, and farm work license that would expire during the peacetime emergency​. The expiration dates for these licenses will be extended for two months after the month the peacetime emergency ends. 


As of right now any license that expired during the shutdown is valid until July 31."
