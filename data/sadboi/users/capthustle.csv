COVID19_support,fmkjvv2,t3_fvth0n,1586157475.0,"I was wondering this myself. I think herd immunity is 80% of the population infected. I also read that the longer this virus exists the less deadly it gets. The flip side is it gets more infectious so more people will get it but it’ll be way less deadly. Personally I’ve been staying inside and barely leaving with the hopes I can keep from getting this first few strains. I’ve gone out just a handful of times to get groceries and have been wiping everything down and washing my hands as well as not touching my face. I have a face mask now. We are seeing promise with anti virals on the way that will definitely give us a way to slow this down even more in the coming weeks. So in the end practicing good personal hygiene, staying home, length of virus existing, anti virals, and ultimately a vaccine, I do believe some of us won’t get this and if we do it will be minimal, and before we know it the anxiety will be no more than what we feel about the flu. We’re going to be ok."

I have an appointment with my therapist on Wednesday to try and talk through some ways to get this under control and my doctor was kind enough to put me on a new anxiety med. I'm so worked up I haven't slept more than 2-3 hours a night for the last 2-3 weeks, I am constantly worrying that any tickle in my throat is the start of it, and then my chest is always tight and I think that is an issue.
