He claims that men and women cannot work together because “it hasn’t been proven yet that they can” how’s that progressive? If anything he’s putting limitations on both genders.

And let’s not start about his narrow mindedness when it comes to the transgender community.

It’s also not wrong at all to have an open mind and get a perspective from a group you don’t believe in, they might change your mind. 

Yeah you can advise her to focus on her kids but if she’s gonna fall into a depression because of a lack of a love interest then that’s gonna affect the kids. She has the right to be concerned on finding a quality man because she can’t let just anyone in her life as she has kids. So far she’s acting a lot more mature than her ex husband, who fathered another child and is being a deadbeat about it. 

There are plenty of quality single fathers who could’ve had a similar story like hers, I don’t see why they should avoid her. 

There’s a fine line between calling out women’s entitled behaviour and bullshit and just straight up hating on them and I feel in this case it’s the latter.

In Iraq for example they have a minimum number of seats in the government reserved for women and usually they get so desperate they put unqualified, sometimes even uneducated women to fill them.
