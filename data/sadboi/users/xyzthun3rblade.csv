SuicideWatch,feafltq,t3_eo9o49,1578948130.0,"Alright listen, you’re 13 years old, you have a whole life ahead of you. I’m not gonna pretend like I have any idea what you’re going through, I’m also not going to give up on you. You have a life, you think no one cares about that life? Idk you, idk anything about you, but you’re a human being, and you’re worth more than you’re aware.

You think no one will miss you, but if u end it all, I promise on everything that I WILL miss you. You’re young, with pressures on you, you’re young, and feel misunderstood, you’re scared, and that’s ok, it’s ok to be scared, but it is NEVER ok to kill yourself.

You’re life doesn’t belong to you, it belongs to those who care about you, so I can tell you that every person who has seen this post so far has your life on their shoulders. Do not take it from us, we cherish it more than you know, and I’m not just saying this either, from the bottom of my heart, I mean this. You’re life, you’re whole life, isn’t something I want taken, isn’t something you want taken, you just want to be free of the pain, so live long enough to see it disappear, you don’t even know if it ends when you die. I know it doesn’t actually, because that pain will move in to me, and all others who see this, so please, don’t end it. 

Please."
