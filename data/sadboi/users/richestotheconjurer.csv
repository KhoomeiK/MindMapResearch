Onision,f7z9lzb,t1_f7n0fu5,1574107452.0,"being declared too insane to go to court is extremely hard and does not happen that often. part of it is proving that he didn't know his actions at the time were illegal/wrong. and since he was traveling to other states for sex, he obviously knew what he was doing was sketchy."

hamsters,ey9wt4t,t1_ey9po7p,1566954141.0,I was telling you that for future reference. And I'm not offended. I was just expressing that it's probably not a good thing to say when someone's pet dies.
hamsters,ey9petx,t1_ey99n2d,1566949106.0,"I think you had good intentions and I understand where you're coming from. Some people cope with pet loss by rescuing another one. Other people need time to grieve. They were sitting at the vet waiting for their hamster to be euthanized and you were already asking if they would get another one. I don't think it's a harmful question to ask, but there is a time and place, as well as proper phrasing."

My600lbLife,exj7m3y,t1_exj28sc,1566343754.0,"Yeah. I understand that prices vary by area/state, but I feel like I spend way more on unhealthy foods vs. produce. Even with prices being kinda high where I live right now, it's still cheaper to buy that instead of junk food. It only gets expensive when you keep wasting it and have to buy more. The ""it's cheaper to eat out every day"" argument has never made sense to me. People just don't know how to shop."
