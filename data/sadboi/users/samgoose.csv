I like the fact you are reading the Patranks.   But you need to read them without Mataagrah.

Patrank 231 - If you Study Parmod bhaavna, you would not have problem with what He is saying.  Rather than being stuck in Jain vs non-jain, He is taking what is best from everyone.  You DO NOT HAVE TO Be a ""Jain"" to be a TRUE Jain.  If you read all of Kabirs Pads / Narsih Mehta's pad, one thing Seems clear.  They had Atma Anubhuti.  And HE is clearly mentioning their Bhakti - despite being poor.  And that they are Nispruh (and what people praise is what God Gave Them).   

So I don't see any problem with praising someone if they have attained that Gun!  But if you are stuck in Mataagrah - than you will have problems - even if the praise is towards a Muni in a different Sampradaay.

Patrank 708 - Please Please Please Read EVERY Word of a jnani purush.  Else, arth nu unarth thai jashe.

He is pretty clear here.  ""ghanu karine"" - So He is not saying Guru Shishya relationship has not happened, but MOSTLY.    Until HE attains monkhood, He is not going to establish Jain religious order.  And again - ""vedokt Dharma prakashvo / sthaapvo hoy to mari dasha yathaayoga chhe.

So not saying Plant is an Animal.  Just that it's a LIVING being.  And what makes them living being is the consciousness.  Once the consciousness

As for robot, they are different because it's ""programmed"".  Whereas in living beings it is from consciousness as well as learning.  So robots don't have ""feelings"".  Where as living things do."

First thing you need to do is raise self-esteem and have some confidence in your self... Find good qualities in you.  Than let everything else take care of itself."
philosophy,fb2atxe,t1_fap0ts5,1576447819.0,"Again..as you said, Karma can give you a specific situation.  But due to ignorance or identifying your self with the body,  there is ""suffering"".  

But, you would not call Buddhas Karma as suffering.. There may be pain, but suffering is not there (after realization)."
philosophy,faowiuy,t1_faoqcjr,1576274196.0,"How you define suffering is always from a certain view point.  So from one point of view, there is only suffering in World.    
But from another point of view, suffering is just your thought.    


Here is one example. A father comes back to a village and sees his house burning.  This made him sad / suffer.  But than he heard the news that his son had sold the home.  Upon hearing this, he was happy.  As he was talking to his son, he realizes that the contract was not signed.  And again he is suffering.  

So ""suffering"" is usually due to attachment to things.  If you are detached, than there is no suffering."

AskReddit,f7flqoz,t1_f7d7oux,1573682127.0,"1. Any religion that frees you from the bondage of Karama - eg. leads towards self-realization.
2. Our goal is self realization... A non-religious person can be more religious than a religious person and vice versa... As per Jainism there are three ways you can do Karama - Speech, action, or by MIND - as a ""religious "" you could be doing one thing and your thoughts are towards doing something else.  where as an atheist might be doing a good deed because he WANTS to - his mind, action, and speech are in the same direction.
3. My followers are those who are leading towards self-realization of the soul.  
4. K A R M A
5. I am represented by self-realized people.. 
6. As per Jainism cosmology, there are 15 planets with human life.
7. In Past, Present, and Future, the Top-Most meaning of life is self-realization... But how you get to that changes based on Time, Place, and Type of People.  I would leave it to a self-realized person to determine what changes need to be made."
