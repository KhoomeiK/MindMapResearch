SASSWitches,fpru470,t3_gf3z8q,1588862072.0,"this is why i have a problem with spells in general especially ones that are supposed to bring about a desired outcome like wealth or improvement in relationships. instead you should work on improving yourself and your situation instead of relying on a spell to magically save you. if you need money, i dont believe a spell will work, you have to put in the work to make your situation better. if you need help in a relationship, you need to do deep introspection on what you may or may not be contributing to a relationship and communicate with your partner. although i am open to the fact that spirits may exist, however, i have never come across one. and if something spooky happens like the lights flicker or i hear a weird noise, i always try to rule out what it could be instead of going straight to ghosts."
