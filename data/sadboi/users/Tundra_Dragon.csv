My guess is the laser read mechanism might be getting off track... When I was fixing my player, it did exactly as you described, but only at either the beginning or end of a side... Like end of side A would get choppy if it went to the full 60 minutes, and beginning of side B would be a chugging skipping mess until about the 4 minute mark. 

There should be some adjustment screws to move the laser carriage track left or right. Try a little turn clockwise, and see if it helps or hurts. If it hurts, turn it back to center, then give it a little turn counter clockwise. Should be adjustments for the innermost and outermost connection points. 

Good luck

These were two of the same model, both with distinct but different issues.  Found them both on eBay for 40 each after shipping... So, high end player for 80 bucks and a couple hours. 

PS, the auto flip mechanism in the CLD-D_02 and older are absolutely horrible. There are so many moving parts, it's no wonder both were screwed out of the box... Newer players have a much simpler, and reliable flip mechanism. Looks cool as frig, but holy shit did it suck getting everything aligned."

The baseplate had taken a severe hit, and bent it to the point that when the disc clamped, it forced it into the steel tray and door lift mechanism. After some good ol' percussive maintenance, I ran into a much worse problem. As the disc hit speed, it would fail to read, forget a disc was in there and unclamp, sending that pound of spinning plastic hurling around inside. 

Second player came, and I think it was stored outside in the dirt for a while. It could not read side A, and had issues flipping to side B, so I found some adjustment screws, loosened them, and pushed the tilt arm around until I got good picture. From there, I adjusted the tracking until it matched what I figured was about the angle I moved the tilt arm by, and dialed it in from there. 

So, now I have a CLDV840, which seems to be based on a CLD-D702 to set under my CLD-D504... 

Why? Because 2 disc movies piss me off, and I'm not paying $800 for a LD-W1. Next step: install a line that  triggers off of the end of disc command from the 504, and tells the 840 to fire up. I was hoping they used different remote signaling, but they use about 90% same. If I get a stock remote, then theoretically, I should be able to have one off, and the other on... Hit power at the end of disc 1, which shuts off one, and turns on the other, then hit play.

One of my idiot friends dropped it (fortunately on thick carpet) while I was rearranging the home theater equipment stack, and that was the apparent result. The upper carriage is completely separate from the lower one, and the lower carriage is bolted to the spindle motor, so adjusting the upper shouldn't mess with the lower.

Rapid cycling is sort of how it sounds.  I've had it as fast as a day or two between swings.  Thankfully, I've not had that happen in a long time. Normal cycle goes over a few months or so, even up to a year or more.  

Remember, it's not some crazy mind thing, it's a chemical imbalance in the brain, and a little nudge may be all it takes to fix it.  Most bipolar meds sort of saw the most extreme points off of the emotional curve... If a depressive swing of crying and asking to die is a -10, and happy beyond joy, with extreme agitation/anxiety/angry outbursts/etc is a +10, then most meds will sort of cut that back to a more normal baseline of +4/-4, with emotional peaks going up to about +6/-6.

You could also talk with HR if you're worried about anything from your supervisor, but they can't legally discriminate against you. 

More importantly, you got your promotions because of the work you did, and you were bipolar when you did it. Your supervisor knowing this shouldn't change anything. You

I have a friend who has tartive diskinesia, and found a med that has all but reversed it.  I can ask about it if you like, but usually dropping the med will relieve the symptoms.
