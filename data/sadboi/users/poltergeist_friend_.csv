But it‚Äôs worth it IMO. Worth it to be the real me, not being pulled around by my manic impulses or drowning in depressive thoughts. 


I try to counteract the impact the medication might be having with positive behaviors - drink a ton of water, try to eat healthy meals with lots of fruits and veggies, exercise as often as I can. 


I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôve contemplated suicide so many times. Like really, honestly wanted to go there.  Med intervention for me has halted this a lot, so I also factor in that if meds help me not off myself, even if they make me somewhat less healthy than I would be otherwise, I‚Äôm still gaining life. Combine that with the positive behaviors, maybe a decently long and healthy life. 


You‚Äôre not the only one who feels this way and thinks about going off the meds. I did it last year. I felt fine for a long time, but eventually I will always get manic again. So meds it is. Cheers to our livers and kidneys and thyroids and brains, long may they function!"

As for the other events, and feeling alone, you aren‚Äôt alone (ironically enough). Sometimes with bipolar we feel alone in a crowded room. I‚Äôm feeling really down and alone right now too. 

My suggestion as a friend would be to make sure you are taking care of what you can with the other events - control the controllables in your life for the most part - then go for your channel. I am really bad about following through on things and having my own hobbies, so I‚Äôm inspired by your creativity here. Just make sure you are taking care of yourself (sleeping, eating healthily, etc) and feeding into your larger goals. When I get overwhelmed with emotion I use an anti-anxiety med, not sure about you but it can help from feeling overwhelmed if you ever feel that way. Best of luck and you can pm me if you want to chat."

Finished my stay in a mental hospital and stabilized, was on abilify & klonopin for several months doing fine, missed a psych appt due to rescheduling and they never followed back up.

Cue me stopping meds & light klonopin withdrawals (do not recommend). I was ok for about 9 months until summer came again...... and I was like ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I sleep?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy do I feel so ridiculously happy?‚Äù And I realized whatever was happening before was happening again. That‚Äôs when it really set in for me, yep, I‚Äôm bipolar, and going off meds can be dangerous. I didn‚Äôt do anything tooooo bad before getting back on the meds this time but looking back I‚Äôm still like wtf was I thinking on some of those decisions.

All I‚Äôm saying is that sometimes the meds make us feel good enough to think we can go off. Personally, i feel like its playing with fire. I thought that if I knew I was manic I‚Äôd be able to control it, but it‚Äôs stronger than my rational mind without medication.

I wish you peace and hope you find something that works well for you. Be honest with your doctors, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs helped the most for me. Know you are loved and worth help and worth the fight."
