depression,f32rueq,t1_f32fzg2,1570623980.0,I used to do this (I remember a period where I only ate blueberry pop tarts) It worked pretty well until I had to account for acquiring the food. Grocery stores and food shopping stress me out quite a bit. It definitely works if you can get over the initial hurdle of getting the foods.
depression,f32rd9n,t1_f32gmoq,1570623528.0,"To be honest, I’m trying to figure that out as well. A lot of the time I feel like I’m not actually depressed but just lazy. Like my depression isn’t real and I just need to suck it up. But then every bone in my body aches and I physically cannot muster up enough energy to do anything and somehow dying from starvation makes more sense than accomplishing the task at hand because it’s what I deserve for putting myself in this place. I know the line is somewhere between “I don’t want to” and “I’d rather die” and I have no idea how to determine the difference."
ptsd,f2ncvc0,t3_ddrx9g,1570314500.0,Yes. I would typically dress in menswear that’s too big (I’m a petite female).  I hardly wear makeup and my hair is never “done”.  I didn’t realize it was a coping method until my therapist pointed it out.
Anxiety,f2fh1w7,t3_dd05pe,1570217656.0,I’m in this weird place of wanting to sleep to not deal with real life but also being petrified that I’m going to stop breathing if I fall asleep so I can’t sleep.
