TeenAmIUgly,fornqsp,t3_g8sobz,1588015347.0,"It’s truly a beauty in the eyes of the beholder thing, some people will say rude things be jerks and not try to see the beauty in one. That’s usually always been my specialty. I’ve never failed to point out someone’s facial structure qualities to point out the beauty on a simply vanity stand point. So I’ll do the same with you. From the flow of your hair it seems as though it compliments your jawline and cheeks very well, from the angle it seems as though your cheeks are naturally plump, although the expression does alter their appearance. Your bottom lip is full and matches the upper lip having an average furrow which doesn’t lead you to having a cleft lip. This averageness though comes together well with the other pieces, placing it with your bottom lip it completes the two for what I imagine to be a more full and vibrant experience, if taken care of properly you’ve been complimented on your lips. Although a cleft chin is visible it fits your character and overall presence in the picture and I’d assume any other kind of viewing. Your nose is wide, but not large, the bridge shows that you do not have a rather “out there” nose and it’s more close to your face leaving the wideness of your nose to be something adorable when scrunching up when laughing or smiling. The slight bags under your eyes adds to a look I don’t think you were going for, either the filter or makeup is an attempt at hiding them, but that is perfectly ok. That’s the perfect ratio for you. While wide almond eyes aren’t usually my favorite, they suit you well accompanied by your brown eyes leading for an intense gaze into someone, whether you know how to do so is on your own accord. The gap between your eyebrows is neither too large or small which is good Bc it keeps you from looking like a racist drawing of an old Chinese man or like your eyebrows are in a fight trying to get away from each other. The curve of your hairline shows that your forehead may stick out a small bit being slightly prominent, but that’s just fine due to your hair hanging down over most of your forehead. All in all, you are not ugly, I’d say atleast your average and at most beautiful. Also saw the comment about being straightforward, it’s about finding the right person to match your personality whether it be someone on the opposite spectrum or on the same boat."
LGBTeens,fopvfex,t1_fopr3a2,1587973438.0,"I’ve been seeking professional help for a year now, my family nor my school cares at all. Truly my end has been my happiest thought. I don’t think about my immediate future much, I think about my five year plan all the time. Even then I go further with my plans and how to achieve them. I don’t want to bother my ex with my current life, it gets worse everytime I wake up. She has the potential to be happy. Why would I want to start to slow that down for her in anyway."

LGBTeens,fomtv36,t1_fomt7rj,1587903643.0,"I’ve tried that and in the immediate process it feels like I was simply used for my body. I broke that off and rebounded to the girl I’m dating currently, even this relationship feels like a lie though. I can’t see anyone without seeing her, I felt comfortable with her, no one else gets me to that level of comfort and I hate it. I ruined my only chance at happiness and now I’m going to be miserable til I either off myself or die of natural causes. Self harm was way before her, plus she helped me quit it for the time we were together."

I thought I was a shit enough person to fully venture and I can say I haven’t eaten all day, it will continue to stay that because of how fucking bewildered I am by the possibility that someone I can love in the future would be into that. Save yourself, save your loved ones, save the world and burn this thing with a fucking flamethrower before a mound of puke collectively piles up and singlehandedly floods the streets of New York as though this was the flood god was telling Noah about and some scat version of him has built an ark of shit and will float past our bodies only hoping for the suffering to end in our watered eyes."

This place just feels so unfamiliar to me it’s ridiculous, this isn’t where I live at all. I have no real friends that’s really want to be around me. Nobody truly cares for me, I haven’t been checked on ever and it just feels more and more that I’m sinking in to my own soul diving deeper towards an abyss of my dreams and everything. I just want to go to the woods by Hancock, NY and off myself. That’s the only place that’s ever felt like home to me. I never felt more comfortable anywhere else in my entire life.

Truth is though those crazies may just end up having kids some day, the weirdos that used to talk about all the crazy shit they did back in high school may just have those kids I’m talking about. The fact that this is a well known possibility and no one cares is kinda worrying. Those kids may learn to blend into society and find ways to gain power and cause havoc on the world that we apparently love. This has been happening for generations now and it still goes unchecked as though it’s nothing to worry about like a downfall of our society is not a possibility from breeding the insane."
