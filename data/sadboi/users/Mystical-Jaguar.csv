childfree,fpog4vc,t3_gek1qq,1588783924.0,"Two of my ex-partners practically raised their younger siblings because their parents put that responsibility on them, and guess what? Neither partner wanted kids. They felt like they’d already raised kids before and were over it.

A friend from a large family said the same thing.

Your friend is choosing to have the kid, the kid isn’t choosing to have her has a parent.

If someone has a kid just to throw them responsibilities and expectations that they’re not ready for and didn’t ask for, they’re selfish and shouldn’t be having a child."

Wellthatsucks,fmb7in4,t1_fmb3ay9,1585920331.0,Great idea! One day your kid will come home from school with an assignment to ask you about where you were and what you did during this pandemic. The letter would be a beautiful thing to share.

My guess is that doom and gloom gets better ratings. That, and so many people aren't taking this seriously so recovery stories would just add to that number. 

\*sigh\* I'm unplugging for a while too. I get texts from my local government and that's about all I can handle."

Childfree people are not disposable, and people with children are not superior. We shouldn't have to pick up breeders' slack at the expense of our own health and safety or that of our family members. 

Yes, childfree people have and take care of \*gasp\* family members too. These members just aren't children."
AskReddit,fi46rfl,t3_f6a9gt,1582135099.0,"A Fitbit, Garmin, or Apple watch to track my stats when I ran track and cross country. All I had were print outs and handwritten race results. Plus, I was bad at paying attention to my split times during longer races. It would've been cool to have the Apple watch ""tap"" my wrist after each mile during training, record split times, or log routes via GPS.

I always wonder how much better I might've been if I could've played with the data and ran with more clear goals in mind."
AskReddit,fgsnvia,t3_ezoc51,1581088832.0,"Have one and it's great! I've been told that he waits by the front door just before I come home from work. When I walk in and bend down to take off my shoes, he purrs like crazy and jumps up to headbutt my face. He often follows me around and sleeps next to or on me at night.

He even humored me and learned few tricks. He can sit, ring a bell, catch treats in his mouth, shake, etc. on command and with hand signals. Aside from the food, he seems to enjoy the attention. He doesn't really scratch, bite, or hiss - just a chill kitty that loves people.

Not sure what I'll do when it's his time."
