cigars,fr15gmc,t3_gm2ay4,1589813617.0,"AVO XO was an amazingly smooth, mellow smoke that I enjoyed a lot.  Arturo Fuente makes some of my favorite cigars, don't think you can go wrong with any of them.  I also really like the My Father La Antiguedad.  If you want a sugar tip the Deadwood Crazy Alice is a fun little smoke.  There is a section in this sub that explains the best cigars for beginners, I'd check that out and if you are going to a brick and mortar then I'd ask the employee what they recommend, but it'll probably be something on that list I mentioned.

Happy early birthday and welcome to the hobby!"
cigars,fr11qv4,t3_gm2722,1589811548.0,"Got this robusto from Smoke Signals in Tombstone, AZ recommended by the employee behind the counter.  I've never had a Cameroon before this so idk what they're supposed to be like, but I'm honestly not sure if I like it.  It's got a musty, lightly spicy taste to it and I'm hoping it changes a bit by the final third.  Overall not my favorite smoke but for $4.50 it was decent enough and I would smoke another if someone bought it for me.  Wouldn't go out of my way to buy another though."
cigars,fqyukg2,t1_fqytyow,1589754801.0,Because I want something large enough to replace my 100ct wooden humidor.  I can't tell if the humi has an issue sealing or if it's an issue with heat/arid weather of the Sonoran desert but my wooden one cannot hd rh to save it's life.  I'd take all the foam out and put some cedar inside.
cigars,fqyityg,t3_fd2778,1589749279.0,"How'd you like the apache?  I want to replace my wooden one, it won't hold rh and figured this thing would work wonders as a replacement."

cigars,fqydh1f,t1_fqyd381,1589746816.0,"I have a wooden humidor but it's such a pain to keep rh where I live in SE AZ.  I think my humi might not seal correctly, because I've tried all sorts of ways to season/maintain and it always drops."

I asked in here a few weeks or so ago if anyone has tried out their signature line of cigars named after famous faces in Tombstone's history.  I asked the guy working there, who is probably one of the nicest cigar shop employees I've ever met, about their line of cigars.  The owner of the shop blended these cigars himself and has them made by the same factory that handles Ghurka, so these things aren't the gimmicks I thought they might be.  The employee also recommended a no label Cameroon so I got that as well.  Can't wait to try them all out!"

If you haven't already, place some clear silicone around the edges of the glass to prevent air coming in or moisture leaking out.  Otherwise, your humidor looks great and I'm jealous yours is stocked!"

Traeger,fpdox24,t1_fpdicyd,1588531289.0,"Like I said, from what I've read that was the conclusion I came to.  I always wrap with foil because that's what I have available and my last brisket was the best I've ever made, including the bark.  If you wrap the meat tightly with foil it does not steam, but that's the key term ""tightly""."
Traeger,fpdhdwi,t1_fpdfl0m,1588527024.0,"It's really preference.  Some people prefer to wrap with foil, some with peach paper, some don't like to wrap at all.  The wraps serve the same purpose and from what I've gathered they both produce about the same end product."

I went in on it with my father in law who owns a small domestic and game processing shop so I can't imagine it's anything terrible.  I did a reverse sear on some ribeyes, cooked to 120 and seared with grapeseed oil then basted in salted butter and garlic.  There wasn't much intramuscular fat in the steak and I think that's what got me disappointed.  I got some briskets that I'm going to try to smoke this weekend, hopefully those are a bit better."
