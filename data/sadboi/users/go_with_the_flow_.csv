CapitalismVSocialism,ey3hz3f,t1_ey3cdmv,1566764861.0,"Humans have a drive to create and learn regardless of what system is in place.

Capitalism is not responsible for the drive in humans. Humans want to solve problems. Capitalism is just the most efficient system CURRENTLY. I think now we are seeing it has more flaws than previously understood. 

Only certain people benefit from this system. Millions are fucked over. But who cares as long as I get my cut, right?"
