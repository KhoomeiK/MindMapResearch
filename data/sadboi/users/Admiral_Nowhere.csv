AskReddit,fioyfts,t3_f8pr0l,1582593921.0,"My wife had come down with a cold and the doctor gave her an antibiotic. She took it at dinner per the directions and we settled in to watch a movie. As the movie went on, I noticed that she wasn't talking or asking me what they said (the TV had a crappy speaker). I looked down at her and asked: ""You OK?""

She tried to say something, but it was like her tongue couldn't twist right to make the words. She mumbled something and I just knew in the pit of my stomach something was wrong.

""Get dressed. We're going to the hospital."" I pulled her to her feet and pushed her into the bedroom. She got dressed, but it was taking her longer and she couldn't seem to do a lot of simple things like get snaps to close. I was getting out of my shorts when I watched her fumble with the zipper. ""Fuck this, let's go."" I'm still in shorts and a hole riddled t-shirt, she's in her nightgown and jeans.

I walk her quickly down the steps, and she's leaning on me more and more. We've been married about five years at that point, and I'm thinking that she's having a stroke. I'm panicking inside, but I try to keep my wits together so I don't start blubbering about losing my wife.

I gently put her in the car and buckle her in. I hop in the other side and jam the car in reverse. I leave hte apartment complex and head to the nearest hospital. The slowest I go through the mostly residential area is 55. Thank God this was late night because I blow through several red lights when the intersection is clear.

I pull up to the first set of doors I find. The nurse there looks surprised at me (then) a three hundred and fifty pound man power walking a woman who's maybe 100 lbs. soaking wet in clothes towards her desk, leaving a running car behind.

I don't remember what I did to get her checked in, but they took her back quickly and I went to park the car. Wheezing like a train engine, I ran back to the little room where she was sitting. I was fully expecting to see a trauma team hovering over her like in those hospital dramas.

Instead, I see a friendly doctor hand her a paper cup and some water. She tips back a pill and drinks the water. 

""I'm her husband. What happened?""

""She had an allergic reaction to the antibiotics. It was good that you got her here, or she wouldn't have been able to breathe. Next time she has these symptoms, just give her a benadryl and watch her closely.""

That was the closest I've ever come to having her die in front of me, and I am not too keen on repeating that."

I'm Evan and I hate my jobs.

I work at a call center, so you can imagine what I have to go through in the course of the day -- the crying, yelling and cursing. That's before I get to work, after that it's all downhill from there. At least the people I work with are good company. That makes my second job much worse.

My other job is worse. I get hired out to sabotage companies like the one I'm at now with my new friends by bad luck. I walk in, lay the whammy down on something and leave. The pay's good, but all the money in the world doesn't help me sleep well at all. My less than sympathetic co-workers and boss don't help matters.

How do I keep my sanity and a roof over my head?
