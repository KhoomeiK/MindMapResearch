It‚Äôs tough but I‚Äôm trying to remember that Jesus is more important then my friendship with him. As hard as that is to say for me right now, deep down I know it‚Äôs true.

schizoaffective,fopgnx6,t1_fopf4zu,1587961007.0,"I would definitely say after almost 5 years of ups and downs and med adjustments that it DOES get better. Maybe it‚Äôll never be normal, maybe it will. But for me I had to find a new sense of normal. I‚Äôm so sorry that your struggling.. just know you aren‚Äôt alone. 

I also would say, if you can keep a job and avoid being on disability - do it. I was forced onto disability by my parents and have struggled to hold down a job ever since. Even if it means you have to go part time so you don‚Äôt get overloaded or anxious. Of course you always know yourself best so do what you think is right. But it‚Äôs extremely hard to get off disability once you‚Äôre on it for mental illness. I‚Äôve struggled to get off it and it‚Äôs a painful process. You basically have to prove that you‚Äôre able bodied which is hard to do having this diagnosis. I wish I could work. Having a job and a steady income is a blessing. I only receive $700 a month and if I try to work, they lower that amount. So if I lose that job it takes two extra months for them to put my benefits back to normal. There are so many other things that are really hard to deal with. Like finding housing, affording groceries etc. I actually have to move to another state because where I live now is too much to afford. Sorry for the rant haha. 

I hope things get better for you and that you can overcome these fears and bond with your baby more. God bless you üòä"
schizoaffective,fopetpu,t1_fopeoyw,1587959683.0,"I‚Äôm so, so sorry to hear that. Do you feel you‚Äôre in a better place now?"
schizoaffective,fopa42p,t3_g8monp,1587956488.0,"Hey I can pretty much understand some of what your talking about. Female here (22) was diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder 4 1/2 years ago - 2 months after I turned 18. It has been extremely hard to deal with knowing that a lot of people don‚Äôt understand my illness let alone would they know how to deal with it if I ever got really sick again or had another psychotic episode. The only person who truly understood was my mom. Even though she‚Äôs never had a mental illness diagnosis, she had to help me through it. Sometimes I do feel like it‚Äôs better to be single and just live my life that way. But other times I do get lonely and feel like I wish I could talk to some of my friends about it more. I‚Äôve learned and am still learning, who to talk to and who I shouldn‚Äôt talk about my illness with. Most people will not get it or understand, sadly. 

Another thing, about being on disability. I totally get your embarrassment about that. All of my friends have jobs and work and I‚Äôve struggled to hold down a job since I had this happen. I‚Äôve been in and out of jobs my whole adult life because of it. Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be on it forever. Just focus on getting better and getting healthy. You could get off disability. It is hard but not impossible. I have a couple job opportunities myself I‚Äôve been looking at. Just go for what you know you can do. And what you know your strengths are, etc. Don‚Äôt stress! If a job gives you too much anxiety, paranoia etc. then try something else that‚Äôs less fast paced. Lately I‚Äôve found that I might be better working from home, and that retail and customer service is wayy too overwhelming for me. You can get through this. Just take your time and know that as you continue on you‚Äôll find what works for you and what doesn‚Äôt.

Also, you‚Äôll find someone who accepts you for you. It just takes time for that person to get to know you fully. Things will get better. :)"

Christianity,fo6txcv,t3_g4524y,1587566660.0,"I‚Äôm sorry that this happened to you. Nowhere in the Bible does it condone going against government laws at all, UNLESS it‚Äôs harming people and goes against our better judgment to follow the laws enacted by our leaders. Part of Romans, Chapter 13, (book of the Bible) talks about respecting our government and respecting the laws. There are also many other places where it talks about listening to and obeying authorities, especially for the better good and the good of others. The Bible also talks about using wisdom in the book of Proverbs. God wants us to be wise and use our better judgment even more during times like these. What your dad did was clearly putting himself and others at risk. But blaming others for your dads decision isn‚Äôt the best way to go about handling it all. Again I‚Äôm really sorry that this happened to you. Yes God is in control, but we also have our own free will. And sometimes IN our own free will we make decisions that may not be the best without thinking it through. This seems to be like what your dad. Another thing, it actually isn‚Äôt biblical that God will heal us every time. If I jump off a cliff ‚Äútrusting‚Äù that God will save me or that I won‚Äôt break every bone in my body or even that I will die because He‚Äôs in control. That is not trust, that is using the Bible and twisting it‚Äôs words to fit what I think is the right thing, and to try to justify what I‚Äôm doing. That‚Äôs not trust, that‚Äôs testing God. In Matthew chapter 4 verse 7 it says not to put God to the test. Jesus himself said this to Satan (the tempter, and deceiver of the world)

I also want to add, just a short while ago. I thought about giving up my faith and walking out on God. I thought about it. You aren‚Äôt alone in your feelings. And God sees your hurt and your pain. I want to say that honestly, there is no other way for me personally but to know that He is real and that He loves me. What your dad is doing is wrong but no one, not even Christians, are perfect. We all sin. We all mess up. Anyone who says something else to you is probably misled. I would definitely say check out some scriptures for yourself, if you‚Äôre interested. Maybe seeing what it‚Äôs all about will help clarify things for you about God. See for yourself if those things are true. People can really twist everything to suit their own agendas. That‚Äôs why we have to look at context (and historical background as well)

I really hope the best for you and your father. And I hope this helps you. :)"

For anyone to demean you and try to say that what you‚Äôve experienced isn‚Äôt real, is in my opinion, completely wrong. But at the same time I believe that there can be multiple solutions to healing and overcoming mental illness, etc., besides someone prescribing a drug to you.

Christianity,fnoupb5,t1_fnosr03,1587133953.0,Yes! I‚Äôve definitely heard of them and watched some of their videos! They are super informative.
Antipsychiatry,fnotqs2,t3_g3251w,1587133424.0,"Whoa! Hearing this story makes me scared.. I‚Äôm not exactly anti-anything because people have to find what works for them and also risperdal is what got me out of my psychosis. But it also made me gain 60 pounds in a little over a year without changing anything. And I got to a point where risperdal wasn‚Äôt enough. 

I‚Äôm currently on lithium, vraylar, lexapro, and trazodone. After my doctor tried putting me on latuda, abilify, and countless others on and off within a 5 year period.

How did you manage to get off the prescriptions safely? How hard was it to get off of them? Do you find yourself healthier mentally now then before? Etc.

I‚Äôve been on meds since I was about 9 or 10. I was baker acted supposedly the first time when I was 5 years old. I remember being in the psychiatric hospitals as early as 11 years old."

As far as reading the whole Bible I‚Äôm thinking about starting with a chapter a day of a book in the New Testament, if I can even manage that. It‚Äôs better then nothing. And I will check out Steven Bancarz testimony. God bless you, too! Thank you for your kind words."
