teenagers,fr4y7no,t3_gmhu6t,1589899116.0,Why do you do this
StarWarsBattlefront,fr2n0du,t1_fr2k6vn,1589840169.0,Chewie’s default barely kills infantry. The rug needs two or three shots to kill a heavy. Once furious bowcaster is on cool down he is basically dead unless he can stun them with some allies around. I agree fett is the best dark side blaster but I said that they were still up there not that they were the best. I’d say Leia is possibly the best now that she was buffed but Han is definitely a close second at the very least
StarWarsBattlefront,fr2h5vi,t1_fr2deoq,1589837204.0,"No no he’s got a point, clearly solving a problem by creating another worse problem is perfect for the game and should not be complained about, what are you talking about?"
StarWarsBattlefront,fr1tjxq,t1_fr1rk9y,1589825704.0,Grievous might be better if you have high sensitivity though. That new claw rush is devastating
StarWarsBattlefront,fr1tet5,t1_fr0zxsj,1589825635.0,Well in terms of blaster heroes they definitely are but lightsaber heroes mostly outclass blasters so technically kind of correct

StarWarsBattlefront,fqybbih,t1_fqvjroa,1589745820.0,I like the BB units and they weren’t a bad choice to make since they had time and resource constraints but the fact that we get them over Ashoka or Ventress who are iconic heroes of the battlefield is a little disappointing. It would have been awesome to get them and the BB units but it kind of sucks having droids that weren’t even made for combat put in over other characters who were

StarWarsBattlefront,fqqzd3g,t3_gkdhlo,1589574724.0,I’d say I prefer the E-11D for its rate of fire (because half the time I can’t aim) but EL-16HFE is definitely the better weapon if you can aim. It used to be the only gun I’d use because everything else didn’t come close or work well for my play style.

StarWarsBattlefront,fqdv7bn,t1_fqdjng9,1589297172.0,"Very true I despise that turret. Getting hit once with that thing can mean instant death if enemies focus on you even for a short time. Once it slows you down it never misses and you’re abilities are disabled so you can hardly fight back or defend yourself unless an ally kills the y-wing, which rarely happens fast enough with all that health and the heal, or the enemy doesn’t see you, which only happens in starfighter assault 30% of the time. Y-wing is probably the best fighter besides the a-wing"

StarWarsBattlefront,fq76mlu,t3_gh6e1o,1589142464.0,I’d say 270 is the most but having it split between both swings would be better. You could have 80 from the first swing and 190 from the downward slash

StarWarsBattlefront,fq75z1a,t1_fq6r8ka,1589142227.0,He is probably the most dangerous to leave alone besides maybe Leia and chewie with furious bowcaster. Han can quickly kill anyone who isn’t vader in a few headshots so leaving him alone over some saber hero is a death sentence. This applies to all blaster heroes but Han I feel is slightly worse than most
