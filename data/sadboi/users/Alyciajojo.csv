IAmA,flz4081,t3_frv7op,1585615020.0,I hopped around on different meds for a few years and finally found genesight testing. Why is this not the first thing that gets done? Especially with people who have such a hard time find a med that works for them?

Foodforthought,fl2ygiv,t1_fl0r9vu,1584763298.0,A way to get around this is to click on it and go into airplane mode. It has enough time to load the webpage but not enough for it to load the the subscription thing. Hope it help someone in the future.

PoliticalHumor,exca7hs,t1_exc2bu9,1566146238.0,Okay real mature dude idc whatever you can still vote for him 😂😂
PoliticalHumor,exby55n,t1_exbxjil,1566140128.0,I read the article and there’s no real reason voting for him would even help the stock market it simply sounds like he’s trying anything to convince people to vote for him. If anything voting for him would hurt the economy and stock market and 401k. Like I said he is simply just trying to convince people to vote for him. Him saying whether you love or hate me you have to vote for me kinda makes it seem like we have no choice just saying. But to each their own I guess.

depression,eppoc5a,t1_eogdzuz,1559386778.0,"I also have bipolar type 2 like u/gooeyoutcome and that's kinda how mine are. I might get hypo manic a few days every month or every few months depending. I used to think it was just how normal people feel like all the time, but I realized that I would be a little extra anxious than normal. I'd sweat more, think/ talk a little faster, and be more shaky/ jumpy not like major huge differences but enough. But like idk I'm not a doctor or going into that profession and only have the knowledge that I have as a patient so... just saying. Anyways I'm on the same meds as I was when i was diagnosed with depression but there are mood stabilizers you can take with like your antidepressant. Idk if you're on anything or what and I'm not saying you should be at all but yea just adding my 2 bits an just rambling now so yea."
