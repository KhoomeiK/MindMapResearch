A situation worked out for me to rescue a cat from an extended family member, and it's been one of the best changes for me. Things have been difficult in my life for quite a while and having him around has been a huge help with dealing with things. He's super loving and vocal, but of course every kittie is going to be unique, so there are no promises it'll be the same. For me though, he's been a lifesaver."
