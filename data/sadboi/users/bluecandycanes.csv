bipolar,fnymur4,t3_g4j3hg,1587368170.0,"I do the same thing. I dont think there is a way to stop it. I dont know if this will be helpful to you, but this is how i think about it:
If i want to form a relationship with someone in any way, i need to be my authentic self. Oversharing is a personality trait. Its who i am. It doesnt hurt anyone, its just another trait that i worry people might not like about me. But its better to just own it and let people deal with it or not because trying to force myself to shut up when i'm hypo is just trying to be something i'm not.

Idk if that helps at all. Basically, theres nothing wrong with you, oversharing is part of bipolar and bipolar is part of you."
