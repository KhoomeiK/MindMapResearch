In your case, all honesty, tell her that her being your sister to you still means the world. Some people don’t know just how much relationships can affect your whole family life. And to have your family around whether your partner is there or not will help in the long run. Hopefully it’s all in good intention for her to keep a good sisterly relationship with you. Every family is different and so long as things are communicated there can be decently smooth sailing whichever way life goes.

Even if he’s said it’s her fault, doesn’t mean it is. He may have some underlying issues he needs to resolve for himself. Blame can’t be thrown around."
