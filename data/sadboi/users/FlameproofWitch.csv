My sex pertains to my biology, my chromosomes, my physical make up. Just because I like working with my hands, fixing things, because I prefer a beer over a daiquiri, even if I had some notion that my brain was male, that doesn't make me any less likely to be sexually assaulted than a woman who loves needlepoint. It doesn't make me physically as strong as a man either. Nor does it make me less likely to be passed over for promotion than the cookie baking, bootie knitting, make up wearing woman next to me. 

I don't care what trans people's brains look like, or anyone else's brains for that matter. For the record, recent research shows no difference between male and female brains that can't be attributed to brain plasticity. However, how you think, how you feel, what you're good at, or bad at, does not define your sex. The whole premise of that is damaging to both men and women and the idea of male and female brains has been used to repress women for centuries. 

If a male has a brain with a structure more commonly seen in females, then that doesn't make him a woman. It doesn't change his physical reality or his biology."

Your parents are the ones who wanted another child, not you, and frankly there is very little age difference between you. If they want another child, a troubled child at that, the responsibility lies with them, not with another of their children. I'm also confused by the room arrangement. You have to share with Jess or your brother. Jess gets her own room, or to share with you. Why doesn't Jess have to share with your brother? Or maybe they won't get to adopt her if she was going to need to share with a 9 year old boy.

It's like they want to take on this girl, but they won't be the ones ultimately most affected by it and they have no intention of minimising the impact of their decision on those who will be most impacted. They aren't the ones sharing a room with someone who screams in the night. They aren't the ones trying to mitigate her meltdowns in shops. Yeah, you're definitely NTA."

I'm not sure your boyfriend appreciates quite how racist and awful his parents are being, at least I hope he doesn't, but you and he need to have a serious conversation about how bad things are with his parents. You should not be expected to deal with this. He needs to be 100% backing you. He might be a non-confrontational type who just goes along with anything to stop there being an argument. He probably is at least a bit racist himself, you've seen who raised him. I expect on some level, some of that has been absorbed. I don't have to tell you that being an interracial couple will bring challenges. If you have kids with this man, that adds another level. You need someone with a backbone who will stand up for you and any potential kids. If his parents keep this shit up, he has to be willing to cut them out of his life. 

It's a really hard time to be dealing with all of this, with the quarantine etc. I think you need to try to figure out someone you can stay with if you need to.

GenderCritical,fpagkz0,t3_gc6iye,1588447734.0,"Male or female is not an emotion, or state of mind. It'sjust biology. I think you're gradually realising this. 

Men used to be even more open than they are now with their inappropriate behaviour towards women. Someone grabbing your ass or chest in a club was basically expected. If you called them on it, they really had no idea that their behaviour was wrong. Sexual harassment at work was not taken seriously. Upon finding out that I was a lesbian, the amount of times that I heard from a man ""I'm a lesbian"" with him thinking he was the funniest thing alive and I should absolutely sleep with him. 
Things haven't really changed. Men are still claiming to be lesbians, they've just taken it up a notch. Men are still going in to women's spaces, often with really bad intentions. Now they're legally allowed to be there. There have been so many incidents, but the media are barely mentioning it, it doesn't suit the agenda. Women, as always, are the ones paying the price. In case you hadn't yet realised with you being so young, nobody really cares about women. If it was men being endangered, men's sports and scholarship opportunities being crushed, if people were trying to force men in to sleeping with people they weren't attracted to...it would be a completely different state of affairs. The difference with older women, particularly lesbians, and younger women, is that we've seen a lot of this stuff before. We see things going backwards when they had been getting better.

You can exclude anyone that you want to from your dating pool, for ANY reason whatsoever. Nobody has a right to your sexual attentions. To suggest otherwise is rapey AF. 

Trying to tell butch women that they are actually trans is BS too. Recent research shows no differences between male and female brains that can't be attributed to brain plasticity (your brain changes and grows differently according to what you do with it).

Nor do I own that kind of underwear that squishes your stomach in etc. It looks like a torture device. Primarily, I like to be comfortable.

I bound my chest for a fancy dress event once (I was dressing as a boy for a murder mystery party) and it was just really restrictive. I couldn't wait to remove the binding. I don't think that we should be encouraging young girls to do that at all. While they may not love their chest, I think encouraging them to accept it is definitely the way forward. If it grows so much that it is causing major back problems etc. then maybe surgery might be a consideration. I knew a woman who was a US size 4 and had a 32G chest. She was considering surgery. Not to stop men staring, but for her physical wellbeing. However, for most women and girls, some decent, supportive bras are sufficient. 

I'm all about girls learning to accept themselves rather than being taught to hide. Besides, if you hide your chest, men just find something else to perv on. I remember a man in a truck slowing down to stare at the legs and ass of my daughter who had just turned 11. She was wearing shorts because it was around 30C out. I lost my shit and started yelling like a crazy person and he drove off. However, I'm not about to demand or suggest that my child bind her chest and make herself uncomfortable to avoid the stares of men, then sit sweltering in the summer heat, covered from head to toe, again to prevent men staring, as opposed to playing hopscotch on the pavement like she was. She wasn't the one with the problem. 

The men need to fuck off. Young girls need to be left the fuck alone to play and enjoy their childhood and women need to be left the fuck alone to enjoy their lives. It all reeks of rape culture and apologising for women just inhabiting their bodies while excusing men for any and all perversions."

People that have gone through having and raising kids themselves do know stuff about it, and sometimes that stuff can be helpful. I had a discussion with a close friend about baby carriers and categorically told her not to use one she had. My reasoning was simply that the weight distribution would have put considerable strain on her back, I knew this because I did exactly the same thing with my kid and gave myself back problems for close to two years after I had stopped using it. I bought her one that puts the weight around your hips, as a gift. I didn't want her to go through what I did, I would prefer that she learned from my mistakes. I in turn had plenty of helpful advice from people who had kids before me. I did have plenty of not so helpful advice too, so I get where you're coming from with that. 

It's worth remembering that you may well want help from a lot of these people as your child grows. Maybe babysitting, maybe something else.

The simple reason is that it doesn't avoid conflict, it just delays it, and when you finally need to deal with the issue, it's usually worse than if you had nipped it in the bud in the beginning.

I think that this might be a slippery slope here. You are making yourself uncomfortable and compromising on an event that you had been looking forward to, in order to facilitate a lie. Basically to stop family members being upset with you. You let this slide and make your whole event uncomfortable and not what you had wanted, then what? A few years down the line, your kid says ""mommy, why does auntie ...... look and talk like a man?"" What do you say? This kind of thing is likely to happen in public too, because kids are like that.

I never felt that my parents had my back when I was a kid, I felt like they (particularly my mother) would believe everyone else over me.

My uncle started abusing me when I was around the same age as your son, I didn't tell my parents because I felt sure that they would never believe me anyway. I cannot stress enough how important it is for your son to know that he can come to you and you're not going to take everyone else's word over his. 

I don't know how much understanding your son will have around the word 'retard' either. The way an adult would react to hearing someone use that term for a kid with Downs is probably quite different to how a 10 year old would. It's worth having a discussion about the word with him. However, A's mother spreading rumours that your son called her son a retard, with zero evidence whatsoever, save for the hearsay of a child who is, in your own words, a troublemaker, is not in any way acceptable.

What sets me apart from a man, is my body structure, muscle mass, my biology as a whole. Whether I am fertile or not does not dissuade men from trying to put their hands on me, unbidden. It does not change how an employer sees me. It does not change how I would fare in a race or an MMA fight against an average man.

My brain IS my equal playing field. My sex is only relevant to the way I think insofar as it informs the way I am perceived and treated in the world, and subsequently informs my life experience.

He showed up again and everyone was upset. By standing outside, your dog was likely already warning him that he was watching and taking care of his pack, unfortunately nobody noticed that the dog was worried about his pack before the warning bite.

I had an almost incident once, when I was getting a TV service fitted. The engineer showed up, I said 'hi', I let him in and showed him where I wanted the installation. My dog was padding about the house calmly, just watching what was going on. The engineer told me that he had to get something from his van, so he left briefly and came back a couple of minutes later. When he returned, he didn't knock, he just opened the front door. My previously calm dog turned in to a ball of snarling rage and hurtled down the hallway towards him. He ran out of the door and slammed it behind him. I told the dog that it was OK. She calmed down. I opened the door to the engineer, checked he was alright and told him that the dog would be absolutely fine with him in the house AS LONG AS SHE SAW ME LET HIM IN. He carried out the installation and the dog left him to it. It never entered my head that he wouldn't knock again, but tbh I'm often better at predicting animal behaviour than that of humans. It's something that perhaps I should have thought about, but for me, knocking again just seemed such an obvious thing to do.

Sometimes it's interpreting human behaviour that is the issue. Understand that your dog will react to a threat to his pack. That's normal, doggy behaviour. What you need to pinpoint is when a person's behaviour is likely to be seen as a threat. Then you can step in and let your dog know that everything is ok (unless of course it isn't). People who don't have dogs can be completely clueless when it comes to dog behaviour. From what you say, I don't believe that your dog is a threat to your family, he just saw everyone getting upset and opted to deal with the cause of the upset. I know that you'll be more alert and vigilant with your dog and strangers from here on out. You're definitely not the asshole for keeping your dog.

It's not like being straight or being gay where you just want to go be straight or go be gay with another consenting adult (or adults) who feel the same way. Nobody is harmed by that. Engaging in what they want to do, is rape, and will traumatise a child forever.  What I would hate to see is people being put off seeking help for their attraction to children though. That doesn't benefit anyone.

There was a guy at my old place of work who was found with child porn (not at work, at home). He had been married for many years and his wife had no idea. He lost his job immediately (something about bringing down the name of the business). I don't know what kind of sentence he ultimately ended up with. As far as I know, he never actually touched a child. He and his wife had no kids. Child porn of course creates a market for the abuse of children though. He said that he was actually happy to have been caught and to have it out in the open. He had been struggling with it for a very long time."
GenderCritical,exazjb5,t1_exac7ot,1566119405.0,"Me too! The superpower sense of smell thing. It's seldom a good thing. There are usually a lot more bad smells than good smells floating around, plus someone really should ban the use of aerosolized deodorant in locker rooms.

I'm vegetarian because meat smells like death, particularly red meat. When someone is dying, they smell different from normal too. 
I can tell who has been in my home recently from the smell, or who something belongs to. I sniff almost everything that I come in to contact with, every time that I get something new, I'm compelled to give it a sniff. I know what you mean about being able to tell male from female by the smell of urine (and their smell generally) the smell is pretty strong. I've also told family members to drink more water because they are dehydrated, after going in to the bathroom after them. 

Biggest issue that I'm having right now though is a guy that I work with. He's a really nice man. Friendly, helpful and funny. He would be an absolute joy to work with, were it not for the smell. I think he is in the process of losing a massive amount of weight, like he's been really, morbidly obese. He's still big, but he looks a bit melted now (sorry, I'm not sure how else best to describe it), like there is lots of loose skin. It's a sickly smell that gets stronger throughout the day. I remember hearing somewhere that people who are that big can get problems with some sort of fungus under the folds of fat/skin. I don't think it's something that he can help, which really sucks, especially when he is such a nice guy and losing all that weight must have taken a lot of work. Sometimes I wish that my sense of smell wasn't quite so keen."
GenderCritical,ewr2p9j,t1_ewqvvqz,1565691761.0,"Women are being doxxed, physically attacked and threatened when they dare to try to go against the trans cult. I had never seen a pride parade in my life where people were yelling and screaming at lesbians to get out. That happened this year. 

There are a lot of lesbians who are not OK with this. We are often the first ones to be attacked by TIMs. We don't want to date them, that one itself is enough to be screamed at and threatened. Our very sexuality is deemed transphobic.

Many gay bars etc. are now actively hostile to lesbians. Lesbian only nights (that do not include TIMs) cause tantrums, threats and demands that the venue be boycotted. Many of us have children and families, just like straight women do. Every time we speak out publicly, we know that this carries a risk to our families and children as well as ourselves, and yet, we still have people speaking out, but the issues with assembly etc that face all gender critical women, face us too.

Major organisations that are supposed to speak for the whole community, like Stonewall, have essentially kicked out all the lesbians and replaced them with TIMs who say they are lesbians. Understand that we are the first to be attacked, silenced and ousted from our own communities. Gay men will start to get a bit more hassle eventually, but given the choice between attacking a bunch of women, or a bunch of men (let's also factor in the volume of gay men who are extremely well muscled) guess who these TIMs choose? If you think the LGB community as a whole is willfully being silent and endorsing this behavior, you need to look a little more closely. When this does all come crashing down, the gay 'community' will all be dragged down with it. 

I've had to fight for a lot of the rights I have now. Things like a pension being passed to a significant other in the event of my death. Them being my next of kin. To have the same tax breaks as a straight couple do. To be able to get married. I've been threatened with violence, had my kid threatened, had the car trashed, had a man follow my partner up a dark alleyway. Things *were* getting better. When the trans cult fuck everything up, most straight people's lives will largely return to normal. People like me will bear the brunt of public opinion lumping everyone in with this cult. 

Sorry for the rant. I know there was no malice intended, you're on the outside, looking in, but please understand that many of us, likely most of us, are not complicit. They piggybacked on rights we fought so hard for, spread themselves like a disease within organisations we set up, and are systematically fucking us over. People like you, thinking we were all part of it, is what is going to wreck many aspects of my life, long after the trans cult dies and people try to pretend it never happened."
AmItheAsshole,ewr0vni,t3_cpcy8h,1565689164.0,"YTA. 3 months salary isn't actually an arbitrary number picked from thin air either. I think it may have been something perpetuated by a diamond company, but for a long time, the message given was that you should spend 3 months salary on an engagement ring. I see no indication in your post that this woman was endorsing that, the question was not ""how much do you think your fiance should spend on an engagement ring for you?"" The question was about how much a typical engagement ring costs. 

Given the message perpetuated by many jewellers and the influence marketing has on people's lives, her response wasn't an outlandish one. What you *actually* spend on a ring is down to you and your financial situation, but publicly mocking a woman for stating what various marketing avenues have told people for years, definitely makes you the asshole."
GenderCritical,ewosyky,t3_cpdhf6,1565625962.0,"I'm really glad you came to this realisation. The world is tough on women and I know it can be really hard when the world seems to see you as a sex object. 

I don't see all that many butch looking lesbians these days, but historically what almost every one that I've met has had in common is that they've been very gentle, sensitive people. Maybe the way that they look makes people think that they should be tough. It's a massive misconception. 

I think your fiancee should worry less about whether she is 'butch' etc and figure out what clothes etc she thinks look good, how she likes to wear her hair, and not worry about whether that is typically associated with men or women. I think it would be good for her to not feel that she needs to behave in a certain way either. She doesn't need to fit in to any box or embrace any label. She's a woman on account of being an adult, female human. That's it. Whether she wears suits or dresses, whether she's bolshy and to the point, or kinda shy and worried about upsetting people. That stuff is all incidental. I don't think either of you need more boxes to be squished in to. 

I am what you would probably term an older lesbian. I'm encroaching on 40. When I was young, and new to the scene, there was essentially a lesbian uniform. Blue denim, checked shirts, short hair. I didn't fit the bill. Long hair, figure hugging clothes...sometimes I wear make up. It can be quite isolating when you're looking for somewhere to belong. I think the worst thing that you can do though, is change yourself to try to fit in with other people. People would try to call me a 'femme' and it would piss me off (I'm not butch or femme, a tweenie or anything else. I'm a woman and a lesbian. It doesn't need to be any more complicated than that). These labels often have other connotations (like who is more dominant in bed or who does the DIY). You then have a whole set of expectations tied in to these identities, when in all likelihood, you won't fit snugly in to any of them. 

Some people find these terms an accurate descriptor of themselves, but I think you have both had enough pressure to fit in as it is. I miss the late eighties and early nineties when gender non conforming behaviour was largely a non issue, with the likes of Annie Lennox, David Bowie... I don't recall anyone disparaging Ms Lennox for cropping her hair and donning a suit, or there being an issue with Bowie with his Spandex and make up etc. either."
AmItheAsshole,ewl7rhz,t3_cohy7u,1565509977.0,"YTA. You effectively blamed them for looking so similar. I expect that they really like you if they choose to spend all of this time with you. Maybe they thought that you really liked them too, but in reality, you don't even know who's who. 

Try to imagine what it might feel like to have someone you see as kind of a parental figure (maybe you had a favourite teacher) someone that you worked hard to impress, not even know what your name is. To not be able to tell you apart from the other kids. Doesn't exactly make you feel special, does it?

I've yet to encounter a pair of ' identical' twins that I couldn't tell apart. Identical is a bit of a misnomer tbh. I've known ones who were really similar, and it took some effort to distinguish them in the beginning. You will get there though. 

I think you should apologise to them. Explain that you are finding it hard, but you like spending time with them and you want to get to know them as individuals. They might clue you in to things that are different that perhaps you didn't notice. You could even ask their mother."
AmItheAsshole,ewl62hw,t3_cohkx7,1565507612.0,"I don't know about where you are, OP, but in some places, your kids having a different surname from you can cause problems in an airport at passport control for one. I can completely understand wanting your kids to have the same name as you. I can also appreciate that your fiancee may not want to lose her name. 

Like some people have said, hyphenation is a thing. If you really object to hyphenating (I know some surname combinations just sound like a law firm) then here's an alternate thought, why don't you take her name? That way you, your wife and your kids will still all share the same surname. 

On the other hand, if you can't stand the thought of giving up your name, but you expect your fiancee to do just that, that does kinda make you TA."
AmItheAsshole,ewl35lf,t3_coifk8,1565503868.0,"You're NTA at all. There are so many people who will knowingly have kids with serious, life altering issues, and act like it doesn't matter because they will love that kid regardless. I know a woman with 3 severely disabled siblings. She, on the other hand, is healthy. She loves her siblings, her parents love all of them, but those kids have massively impaired life quality, and after the first one, the parents knew that was a distinct possibility for the others.

I can't understand how some people think it is somehow virtuous to have a kid without concerning themselves with what they might pass on. The whole ""I'm not testing for that because I'll love them anyway"" thing. That child will be a person in their own right. You loving them doesn't make them well. If they are in chronic pain, they will still be in pain. If they have masses of mobility problems, those will still exist. Many of these kids will see their peers doing things that they could never hope to do. That must be incredibly hard on them. 

Those people who are berating you for the genetic testing etc. are only thinking about how they feel about their children. I'm sure they care about those kids a lot. They are probably the centre of their world. What I don't believe they are actually thinking about is their child's quality of life when they advocate blindly having another. Thinking about your potential child's health, categorically does not make you an asshole."

GenderCritical,ew67iy3,t1_evxd4z3,1565156878.0,"So many times when I was younger and straight men found out that I was a lesbian, I would get the ""but I'm a lesbian, hehehe"". Far too many men thought they had the right to touch me just because I was within touching distance too. As the world started being a better place to be gay in, and to be a woman in, this diminished. My partner and I started enjoying a freedom that we didn't have before. Now I see young lesbians facing the whole ""but I'm a lesbian"" thing, and it's even more aggressive than it used to be. Things were actually getting better.

Now I avoid gay bars etc. because I don't feel welcome and I don't want to deal with the trans cult. I also fear a massive backlash from the general populus against lesbians, gay men and bisexuals because we are getting lumped in with the trans cult and people are peaking all over the place. I feel really sorry for young lesbians trying to navigate this minefield that we had hoped that you never would need to."
