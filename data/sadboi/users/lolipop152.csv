AskReddit,ficngwq,t3_f7jj9m,1582352769.0,Bloody Mary. I know she wonâ€™t appear but you canâ€™t pay me to stand in a dark room and call her out three times.
r4rSeattle,ffsw41t,t3_euwmov,1580194843.0,Thank you everyone. I will reply as soon as I can. Got a bit overwhelmed. ðŸ˜˜

AskReddit,fehcnio,t1_fefzcyd,1579113820.0,This needs more upvotes. Itâ€™s like the best feeling. When I come home I immediately take off my bra. Lol sometimes itâ€™s literally in the front hall.
AskMen,fbit3g7,t1_fbhvxk2,1576912997.0,"Women are way harsher judges of themselves and other women than men.  Yea obviously some guys prefer certain features, but they generally arenâ€™t as critical as girls. I promise you there are are so many men that love a smaller chest and some that even prefer that."
AskReddit,fb9w7nk,t1_fb8na9h,1576652352.0,"I prefer back and forth and thatâ€™s what gets me off, but I feel like dudes generally like up and down."
BPD,fab54h3,t3_e8chmg,1575917882.0,"Yup. As I was reading it, I was like did I write this. It feels so real when Iâ€™m motivated. Like I really think I will just change. Itâ€™s a pretty constant cycle."
pussypassdenied,f8iq7qk,t3_e0rczx,1574591439.0,"That was horrifying to read. I canâ€™t believe so many people said that heâ€™s the asshole. They had an agreement 50/50. I donâ€™t know where people get this entitlement. Even if Iâ€™m dating someone I appreciate everytime they pay for dinner, etc. Seriously disgusting behavior by that woman and every person who supported her."
Mirrorsforsale,f4zddmo,t1_f4ynsrv,1571904368.0,It made me laugh
ChoosingBeggars,f49ditd,t3_djql4c,1571462988.0,"Omg I feel so dumb, for some reason when I read CVS my brain processed it as QVC. And Iâ€™m sitting here trying to figure out what kind snacks sheâ€™s buying off the QVC channel. Sadly I only realized my mistake when I continued reading comments and remembered that  CVS is a drug store."
pics,f40ad0y,t1_f3xvci9,1571290903.0,Lol I thought it was a chick too if it helps.
tinderstories,f3td4oo,t3_dhtxh4,1571128569.0,That was hilarious. Iâ€™ve had that happen once where he wasnâ€™t inside of me and yet he kept going. I kept telling him but somehow he was just not able to get it in so I let it go and just let him continue doing whatever the fuck he was doing. I was convinced he was a virgin because I didnâ€™t think anyone who had sex before could confuse being outside of a vagina to being in a vagina. Now your story makes me wonder.
AskReddit,f3olsmi,t1_f3n0z2q,1571021373.0,Iâ€™m sorry but that made me laugh so hard. Iâ€™m 34 and Iâ€™ve been asked if Iâ€™m a grandmother at least 3 times. And people always ask if Iâ€™m friends mom and they are like my age. Iâ€™ve given up. I just say Iâ€™m a hot grandma now. Also I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with these people I donâ€™t have a single wrinkle.
BPD,f1t0g7w,t3_daiqz5,1569736837.0,Seriously there have been so many posts I just really relate to. This one is right on the mark. I am only attracted to emotionally distant men who will leave me
BPD,f1npuvn,t1_f1neu7z,1569623094.0,Thanks! Itâ€™s been kinda a rough week. So it feels nice to get that reassurance.
BPD,f1ncqlb,t3_da049k,1569614217.0,I really connected to this. I feel like this a lot. And itâ€™s reassuring to know others feel the same way.
AskMen,ez8jott,t1_ez7fqvc,1567745646.0,"Seems like a lot of us are into that. I love seeing a guy with a belt in his hand, gets me all hot and bothered."
AskMen,eyzrrlt,t3_czk47e,1567623669.0,"I think asking is cute. Usually I think guys pick up stuff from body language but honestly if you arenâ€™t sure, ask. I usually tell them after they have asked once or twice, they donâ€™t have to keep asking. That I would let them know if I wanted them to stop or if I felt uncomfortable."
unpopularopinion,eyvhmw5,t1_eyvhaad,1567494822.0,"Lol no actually that analogy made sense. I just grew up thinking all men liked big breasts. And then I ended up dating a guy who didnâ€™t like my large chest. He liked small A cup sized breasts. Basically what I have learned, no matter your body type or what a particular feature looks like, there will be people who like it."
unpopularopinion,eyv9nv2,t3_cyov0s,1567485288.0,"I hate this too. I had a guy recently ask me if his penis was small and he wanted me to shame him. Even though I knew that was what he wanted, I still didnâ€™t want to say it. Itâ€™s a shitty thing to say."
unpopularopinion,eyv97y1,t1_eyuv7ml,1567484831.0,Is it because they are generally more perky? Or even if they were not perky and had more sag you would still like the smaller ones?  Honestly curious.
bridezillas,euw0v87,t3_chiqk7,1564068186.0,"I have been a bridesmaid in 6 weddings, 2 of them MOH. And I have never dealt with a bridezilla. I did have to buy my own dress in all cases but honestly I think that has become standard. However the most expensive dress was 200 and all bridesmaids could afford it. Reading these horror stories have made me realize how lucky I am to have normal friends. My only bad experience was in my sisters wedding due to one of the bridesmaids. She just kept being difficult. And god bless my sisters calm soul she put up with it. And I would get so mad. Most of it was just petty stuff just to act out. She was upset because my sister ended up picking out her dress and buying it just with me and my cousin. My sister was so excited to find her dress and she basically made her feel shitty criticizing the dress. She spent that evening about to cry instead of being happy. I still donâ€™t quite forgive that girl for what she did."
GoodDudes,etflzjw,t1_etfebm8,1562772656.0,"Itâ€™s super common. Iâ€™ve even asked people in the beginning, like letâ€™s be adults about it. Nope."
GoodDudes,etfe6mc,t3_cberjr,1562767571.0,Seriously why canâ€™t everyone act like this
Tinder,esshj2g,t3_c8ydvv,1562251936.0,"I do the same, when guys ask anal? I say your ass or mine? Always makes me giggle"
EntitledBitch,es0x7v6,t1_es0ty17,1561484806.0,Basically it says I donâ€™t give a shit about anyone else. I drive how I want.
smalldickproblems,erq7y03,t1_erptxps,1561137235.0,Iâ€™m a woman with really high dht and testosterone levels. So that would affect any male childâ€™s penis size?
smalldickproblems,erq6rsj,t1_eroklqf,1561136483.0,Some guys definitely do like being emasculated or being made a chuck but thatâ€™s nothing that should be forced on them. Thatâ€™s seriously fucked up
AskReddit,eqfcjnp,t1_eqf7ko3,1560018606.0,I did it once. Idk I really liked it. I also like giving them when he watches sports. I think I like seeing how distracted I can get him lol
gonewild,eq4yq0x,t1_eq4wzt6,1559789096.0,Good ðŸ˜‰

sex,epp8u98,t3_bvcrbb,1559368874.0,"Yes Iâ€™m Totally like this. Iâ€™ve only been with one man who somehow left me so satisfied that I have to tell him no more. Usually Iâ€™m the one asking and initiating. When you find that person you really match up with sexually, itâ€™s amazing."
sex,epp8qpp,t3_bvhn3y,1559368746.0,Iâ€™ve always included oral but not fondling.
sex,epp8p89,t3_bvamk6,1559368693.0,Interesting. Iâ€™ve never heard of this kink but sounds super hot
BPD,epp8je7,t3_bve3c8,1559368483.0,I know exactly how you feel. Sometimes I just want to disappear and start over somewhere. But loneliness is a scary thing.
specializedtools,eocgpok,t1_eob8x1z,1558457975.0,Iâ€™m 33 and Iâ€™ve never been stung. But Iâ€™m terrified of bees.
