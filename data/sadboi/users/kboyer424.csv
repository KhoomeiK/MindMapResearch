Maybe next month if I can dig myself out of the hole after rent and other expenses. Til then I’ll donate to Bernie Sanders and go to planned rallies when I can afford it."

There are different modules to complete and I can’t imagine my life without it. Some modules may help you more than others. I like the group setting and discussion because I like hearing how other members use the skills they’ve learned, what they find useful, and how they tried even if they think they didn’t. The best part for me is being able to look at the skills set I’ve learned and know what is effective for me based on my emotional state at a specific time. I definitely would give it a try if you can and good luck!! :)"

bipolar2,exqs5k5,t3_cu1jpp,1566506628.0,"I work full time but have a position with flexibility and stability. It is a challenging job but it’s analytical and gives me a break in a way from my emotions. The Monday- Friday routine and office setting helps me a lot. I also have the choice to work from home on days I don’t feel like being at the office or seeing people. 

I previously worked part time at a stressful, busy, restaurant, and I couldn’t handle the high pressure environment so I barely worked. Not having rent $ on time or gas $ each week was so stressful. I worked at a gas station before that for a while and would cry on the regular in the cooler. 

The key for me is making sure I take my meds, go to all of my appointments, and trying to get at least 7 hours of sleep on a work night. Limiting my alcohol intake is key. I overall like my coworkers and work for a small company. I also have an immense fear of losing my independence that drives me as I got divorced in my 20s, had $20 to my name and lived 2000 miles away from my family and friends. I was completely dependent on him and I never wanted to feel that way again.  

Good luck <3"
