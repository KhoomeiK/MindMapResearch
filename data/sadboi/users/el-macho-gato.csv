AskMenOver30,f756nck,t1_f74hb0b,1573412312.0,But don't let my story dictate your chances of trying to get your boyfriend back. It might not be too late for you try to talk to him and see if you guys can work things out. But please be patient and let him come to you when you feel he's ready to talk. I really dont know enough about your situation to know how long you should wait but please dont make the same mistakes as me and make a scene and look desperate. If he was the one who broke up with you maybe there was a reason for it and it's for the best you arent together. But if you think he's just confused please just give him the benefit of the doubt for now and give him the time and space to come to you first and make a decision.
AskMenOver30,f754vo9,t1_f74hb0b,1573411813.0,At the end i think ive come to the realization that we weren't meant to be. We just werent on the same page about what we wanted in life. She wanted to move to the city and I wanted to stay behind in my hometown. She did not like animals and I did. She had four kids and they were her priority as any mother would. But she had very little time for us and at the end I was missing having children of my own and growing a family of my own with the dogs and cats I have. She didnt want to stay behind she had no family where I grew up and she wanted to start over in a big city away from all the drama. I could not blame her on her decisi√≥n. I tried and tried even got on both knees to take me back but it was one too many times we had broken up and she wasnt in love with me anymore. That hurt more than anything else when she told me that.
AskMenOver30,f752byy,t1_f74hb0b,1573411086.0,"I am 34 and she was 42 i did not care about the age difference but I did care about having my own children one day. The love for her should have been enough but at the end my stubbornness and immaturity prevailed. I have alot to work on myslef and right now ive opened my heart to my family, faith and my pets at home that I love dearly. We had too many differences that just didnt work out for the two of us at the end."
AskMenOver30,f751klu,t1_f74hb0b,1573410900.0,"I will be honest with you I haven't met anyone after the breakup. I've had opportunities to hookup with people but I've made the decision to wait. I need to be alone and work on myself first before I can love someone again. We were together for 4 years and it has been 6 months since she left. She went through alot with our breakups, yes you heard that right ""breakups"", as in more than once. Our relationship was toxic no thanks to me especially with being unsure about us being together in the first place. I was not in love with her at the beginning yet she was and I did not appreciate her enough until it was  too late."

science,f746xln,t3_du9wln,1573398904.0,My dogs and cats rescued me through some hard times this year and I am grateful for having them in my life. I love them.
AskMenOver30,f741ms9,t1_f71ualb,1573397123.0,I was very immature at the time and didn't know what i wanted. She had four kids from a previous marriage and i had none of my own.  She was not able to have children anymore due to having her tubes tied and i had doubts of staying with her due to this. And before you knew it she moved away and never looked back but I was still very much in love with her. I take responsibility and have matured since then and wish I could turn back time and tell her that I am sorry. I regret the decision I made because I still have feelings for her even after all these months. But I think the best decision was to just let her go and live a happy life and start over without me unfortunately. I havent wasted my time since and have become a better man because of these life lessons. I will never take my SO for granted ever again.
