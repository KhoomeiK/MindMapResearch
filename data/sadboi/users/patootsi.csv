When glued together well, the sound is consistent and that allows the listener to groove with the music more. One tip I can add is- when compressing for consistency, let‚Äôs say with the drums, keep the settings for attack and release times fairly similar on the different drum tracks. Send them all to a drum bus and add a little more slight compression there for that glue.

mixingmastering,fjpp82v,t3_fdo7cf,1583557118.0,"Some thoughts on your mixes :)

01- WhatsYoName:

I think the leveling is a little off. The vocals a bit too loud in relation to the rest. I think the kick could have more oomph.

--- 

02 - On My Own: 

Better low end here. Also warmer vocals, nice.

---

03 - Friday Night:
Same feedback here on the vocals. they're a little far forward so the rest of the instruments don't seem to share the same energy as the vocals.

---

04 - Holiday:
Backup vocals could come up a bit.. I think the levels are similar to the others where the vocals are just a tad too far forward.
I'd also add some volume automation on the loop to follow the flow of the song a bit more. I really enjoy the feeling that the loop gives.

---

05 - Naomi Outro:
Fun song.. I think it's quite dry though.. reverb wise - I feel like a little reverb could give it a more urban vibe? Maybe that's too subjective? It ends quite abruptly.

---

06. Naomi Freestyle:
Levels here are better! I like the dark, mysterious feeling of the melody looping!


---
In general the melodies and productions are pleasant. I really enjoyed listening to this as I was winding down at the end of the week. Good vibe."
mixingmastering,fjpmk39,t3_fe9dto,1583554890.0,"Some of my thoughts on the mix - there's very little happening in the low end, and some dark reverb could be nice. the fluttery effect right in the start is so nice. Also, I don't know if it's just me or if it's leaning right a bit.

Other than that I think it definitely reminds me of God Of War and I enjoyed listening to it!

depression,er6kacg,t3_c0ozq7,1560549724.0,"Hey.. sorry you're feeling this way. These are all very normal symptoms of someone struggling with depression. I don't know if that's any consolation to you, but know that you're not alone in this!

&#x200B;

When we're depressed, motivation is incredibly hard to find. One thing I've learned from some workshops I've gone to for handling my mental health, is that a change in behavior and spark some motivation. What this means is sometimes you just gotta do it. You know you're not motivated but you have to find a way to tell yourself that you have to do this... you have to do this FOR YOU.. you're worth it! 

&#x200B;

So one example would be changing your sleeping habits.. go to bed at a decent hour and wake up at a decent hour. Don't feel like getting up? Get up anyway.. just get up and make up something to do... whether it's getting a cup of coffee somewhere or taking your sweet time and making a breakfast.. ANYTHING.. even just to go for a walk around the block. This change in behavior will start to trigger motivation. Things might not happen overnight, but just be patient with yourself and remind yourself that you've been having a hard time, but THAT IS OK, and now you're making steps towards a less depressed day to day life. 

&#x200B;

I find that making deals with myself helps too. For example when it comes to laundry and changing bed sheets.. I tell myself that I can only smoke weed or binge watch tv or whatever AFTER I've done the chores. I make up my own little reward system. You gotta be your own best friend. How would you motivate a friend if they were down and indifferent to everything? That's how you can help yourself. 

&#x200B;

I know life sucks right now, but it doesn't always have to be this way. and YOU have the power to change that. I truly believe that."
mentalhealth,eonqbp8,t3_bsji4g,1558718913.0,"I'm sorry you're feeling this way..I think this is a common feeling.. and my theory is that it's mainly due to your depression making you believe that there's something wrong with you.. So you feeling like when you're sharing personal flaws instead of how you would feel if you were sharing that you had a cold.. Depression is a disease, just a different kind.

&#x200B;

 If a friend of yours told you that they were suffering from something, be it physical or mental or emotional pain, would you find them ridiculous and shy away? Most probably you'd feel some empathy for them and hope you can help somehow? The way your ex reacted was terrible and I think certain types of people just react that way but I've met a lot of people who are encouraging and supportive and help me get in the right direction instead of continuing to make me feel like something is wrong with me. I hope that by sharing and being more vulnerable, you will make more meaningful connections. You'll be able to weed out the people who don't empathize and care.

&#x200B;

When one is depressed it's very important to be able to talk about. This gives the depression ""less power"". It's like if you have a conflict with someone, small or large, and you wait for a long time to talk to them about it.. that conflict just keeps growing inside you and it takes over your brain space and it becomes a lot bigger than necessary. Once you talk to them about it (given they are respective and don't really make you more angry), the conflict becomes much smaller and it takes up less space. This is the same with depression. Whatever you resist, persists.

&#x200B;

I think there are organic ways to bring it up.. for example if someone invites you to something and you're feeling particularly low that day.. you could be honest then about having a rough day and dealing with depression but you appreciate the invite and hope to join another time. Sometimes people won't ask how you're doing.. you can't expect them to. It doesn't mean they don't care.. they're just caught up with their own shit. So when telling people, don't expect anything. You could practice with someone you feel you trust.. just say ""hey, can I share something with you that I find hard to talk to people about, but I know that it's healthy for me to?"" One person at a time :) You can do this!"
depression,eok8omb,t3_bs8vhp,1558649058.0,"How about just taking a walk around the block? Or walking to the closest store to get a cup of coffee or a small snack? Don't worry about the purpose so much -- just go outside. If you can do it when the sun is out, that will be the best, but if not, just go out anyway. :) 

&#x200B;

You could also try to make a deal with yourself? What is something you enjoy? What about telling yourself that you can only do that thing you enjoy once you've been out for a walk for at LEAST 10 minutes? I make deals with myself sometimes when I can't find the motivation to do something I know is good for me.. and I know that you KNOW that going outside is good for you :) Be good to yourself.. treat yourself like your own best friend."
