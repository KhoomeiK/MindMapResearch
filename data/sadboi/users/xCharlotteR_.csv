Helemaal geen rare post, veel mensen vinden de moed niet om de stap te zetten om uit de eenzaamheid te geraken. Ik zag alvast feel fijne voorstellen hieronder in de comments.

Verder wil ik nog meegeven dat vriendschappen moeilijk te forceren zijn. Het heeft ongeveer 10 ontmoetingen tussen mensen nodig om op een iets of wat comfortabel conversatie niveau te komen, dus geef zeker niet op na de eerste (beetje vervelende) ontmoetingen met nieuwe mensen.

Als het een troost mag zijn, ook op je latere job leer je veel mensen kennen, moest je nu op school bv. niet meteen aansluiting vinden. Ik zou zeker een leuke hobby zoeken voor erbuiten, en zelfs met bv. gamen of Lego kan je heel wat fijne mensen (eerst online maar later) in het echt leren kennen.

Probeer tevens ook Twitter. De Vlaamse community is klein en het is een goede manier om mensen te leren kennen. :)

Ik wens je alvast alle succes toe!"

The problem is that the firm keeps insisting that how they placed the drain gutter for the walk-in shower was done properly, while my dad keeps insisting that this can not be the case. I have seen it, and it looks very messy and not at all like advertised. The firm insists that there ""should be room under the tiles so that the moisture that gets under tiles (through the ""voegen""), can escape through this open space and runs to the gutter because of the water resistent plastic that is under the tile)

Anyway. The room that is open under the tile is about 10mm and how it was finished at the gutter looks like shit. They offered to finish it with silicones (the sides of the gutter), but that still doesn't fix the open space below the tiles (that my dad insists is bullshit).

Yeah, we're a bit past the point of proper behaviour, unfortunately.

A big issue is that my dad just ""doesn't agree"" with how something is done and the contractor (thanks for the word), can't provide an explanation that satisfies my dad. This is both on *how* something is done, regardless of the insufficient quality of the finished work.

Van wat ik kan opmaken uit je post, lijkt me de kans groot dat je als kind jezelf kan laten emanciperen van je ouders. 

Verder lijkt me de wettekst nogal nietszeggend. Ja, ze dienen in te staan voor je onderhoud en studies, maar je kan het geld niet van hun rekening naar de jouwe overschrijven, hé.

Heb mezelf tijdens mijn studies laten ondersteunen door Studiebegeleiding. Komt er op neer dat je (na lang wachten) een €2500 op je rekening krijgt om te voorzien in je inschrijvingsgeld & boeken. Verder werkte ik ieder weekend en op vrije dagen in de week zodat ik alleen kon wonen.

Onderschat de impact op je studies hiervan niet, ik heb deze dan ook niet succesvol kunnen afronden.

Maar - met goede planning, een flexibele job en misschien iets meer discipline dan ik had, zou het in orde moeten komen. Contacteer je toekomstige school voor informatie rond sociale huisvesting, emancipatie van studenten en ga eventueel langs bij een wetswinkel voor advies omtrent de betalingsplichten van je ouders.  


Veel succes :)"
