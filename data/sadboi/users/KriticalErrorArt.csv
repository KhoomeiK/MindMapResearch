I really hope it does something for you 🤞"
BPD,fi1n061,t3_f5xcwy,1582060898.0,"Honestly not sure if this will help because I’m still waiting to get a series of evaluations to see if I do or don’t have BPD (been hovering about this sub for a few days because it’s strangely comforting scrolling down and just feeling like other people get it and understand how I’ve always felt) but I DO have Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Depression diagnosed, and I also medicate those with weed - 

I recently moved from England to Scotland and had trouble getting hold of anyone, but I found some CBD hash in a vape/head shop and like... honestly I don’t know if it was because it had been a week or so without a smoke, but it REALLY sorted me out emotionally.

No high effect or anything, not drowsy or hungry, but just.... my chest didn’t feel as heavy, and it made the emptiness a tiny bit easier to cope with.

Honestly it’s pretty cheap too, so I’d recommend at least trying it ❤️"
BPD,fhqn5ph,t3_f44p2l,1581806989.0,"It used to be video games or food probably - or art of some kind, I used to be a freelance furry artist and I could just focus on that a lot of the time and my days would go okay.

However I’ve since had to stop freelancing during a huge bout of severe depression? And ever since I’ve just... lost it.
With everything.
There’s so much stuff I want to do, but every time I try, I’m bored out of my mind and end up stopping After ten minutes :’)
Games? Bored.
Try another? Bored (rinse repeat till I run out)
Draw? Bored
Sculpt? Bored
Read? Bored
Watch a movie? End up zoning out 

Just leaves me hella frustrated.

Only thing that helps these days is physical contact, sucking my thumb (yeah, I know 😬), or weed 🤷‍♀️ 
Oh, or the new puppy - that only works when he’s behaving though, if he’s naughty it makes me feel worse and like I’m a horrendous dog mum.

Weed at least leaves me able to actually watch tv or YouTube or something"

I just moved to Scotland over the new year into my own flat and I still haven’t found a job yet :’) 👌"

End it.  
My ex was exactly the same. I didn't want to believe it was over but it REALLY was, and in the end he broke up with me in a fucking VILE way honestly, and I still hold resentment towards him for it a year on.  
If I could go back in time, and not waste years of my life miserable, and end it with him a full year and half sooner than it actually happened? I would. Without a doubt.  


The one positive thing I took from it, is at least I know what I \*need\* in a relationship now, and to value myself and see that I have some ensemble of worth :')   


For the sake of your sanity, please, break it off."
