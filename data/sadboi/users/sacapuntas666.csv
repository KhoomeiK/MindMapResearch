Some people don't respond to texts at all!
 Another point to consider, if something was that important people wouldn't text you, they'd call. if they do  have an expectation of an immediate response to a text based form of communication, I say ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ should've called .
Writing stuff just seems so final and it stresses me out! Most of the time, I keep my phone on do not disturb for text messages and check them when I feel good enough to throughout the day."

High school is a blip. Friends you make in High school are usually temporary if you have them. Being a teenager is truly the worst thing in my opinion, things will get so much better after school whether your grades go well or not. I s2g the worst time in my life was school. You're trapped with other people who are there because they have to be, there are only so many people to make friends with, and grades and schoolwork is so pressuring. Once you've gotten through high school things will be so much better. 

Also, the workforce isn't that bad. I have employed a person with a bachelor's degree and I own a bar, if your grades slip I promise it isn't the worst thing in the world."
