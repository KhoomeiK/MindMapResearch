AskDID,fq9axpg,t1_fq7yu49,1589191968.0,"Thanks, I’ll have a look"
AskDID,fq772da,t1_fq75h96,1589142622.0,"I know. Another thing that my favourite therapist once said which really resonated with me is that I’m still very young and it might simply be too early (I’m twenty). She also said that I have too many mild symptoms of stuff to be really able to tell, so there’s also the possibility that all of those things will just disappear in the future."
AskDID,fq76i59,t1_fq6l5t9,1589142419.0,"Thanks for answering! Yes, I’m in therapy, but it’s never really worked out that well for me because I struggle a lot with feeling invalid. When it comes to the trauma, I’ve had difficult times but they weren’t that bad or physically threatening, which is one of the main reasons I believe I’m making this up for attention. 
As for dissociation, I’m only just now learning about it and I feel like those weird feelings of detachment from the world and myself and things like talking and not knowing what I said might be a mild version of it, but I’m really scared to mention it to anyone, because a friend of mine really does suffer from dissociation that severe that she has to go to the hospital frequently and I just feel ridiculous when I compare myself to her. 
Either way, thank you for answering, and I wish you the best for your future!"
AskDID,fq74vyk,t1_fq6ij7p,1589141828.0,"Thanks, I kind of already did it but I think I will try this again. I’ve been going to therapists for years now and I’ve just found one who I felt really listened to me instead of just deciding who I am. Unfortunately she moved away. Anyways, my current therapist said something about psychosis when I talked about the thought voices, but it was more of a comment than a suggestion. I’ll keep looking and try my best not to influence myself."
AskDID,fq74bve,t1_fq69i61,1589141620.0,"Thank you so much for replying! Right now I’m very certain that it’s hypochondria or something similar, since this has happened before with other disorders. The only reason why there’s a shred of doubt is the fact that all of my symptoms are always the same, I just interpret them differently every few months. I keep thinking “maybe one day I’ll get it right?” But deep inside I also know this is bs because the way I am I can’t self diagnose and I never will. I’m supportive of self diagnosis and I think it’s valid, but I think there’s people who can’t objectively do this and I’m one of them. Either way, I will keep talking to therapists, maybe one day I can let go of all of this ..."
AskDID,fq72yef,t1_fq6061b,1589141109.0,"Thanks! I already talked about the thought voices to my current therapist and she kind of shrugged it off with “could be a psychotic symptom” and then never mentioned it again, which is why I feel pretty insecure about it now (maybe I’m making this bigger than it is). But we both agreed that I should get a new therapist and I think I’m going to try it again and communicate that it’s important to me. (It’s just hard because I don’t see anything I do or feel as relevant or important.)
But I agree, I should stop obsessing about diagnoses and just focus on getting better. I think it’s this way because I want some kind of validation because people have always ignored me, but I need to be working on myself."
AskDID,fq729fc,t1_fq6v2lb,1589140852.0,"Thank you so much for this answer! I’m going to do it this way, as I wanted to change therapist anyway (we both agreed that we don’t work well together). I’m scared to make suggestions anyway because the two times I’ve done that (with two different therapists), they just laughed at me. I talked to my current therapist about it, and she didn’t seem to really care since she made one comment about it and then moved on and never came back to it, but she did say it might be a psychotic symptom. So I’m exploring that as well. But I thoroughly believe that’s not it. Again, thanks for your response!"
