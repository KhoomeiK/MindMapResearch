or say..?"
mentalhealth,fcrihkl,t3_eil0ve,1577902255.0,Whoever feels normal pls comment
mentalhealth,fcq9l8c,t3_eihe59,1577881618.0,"You’re going through something pretty serious as it affects me aswell and I feel like it hurts your soul. I try to change with therapy because human contact is an impossible task. Failing to have a conversation in almost a year brought depression and social anxiety so severly that requires medication. 

And I’m only 20 so this means I’m starting adult life friendless. 

When you recover, please send your blessings to a struggling pal right here🙋🏼‍♂️

Best of luck man"

NoFap,falzlaj,t1_falhcjm,1576193190.0,I mean its funny
mentalhealth,faklkxw,t1_fakl2lg,1576169160.0,"Thats great news. It’s gonna help, but make sure you do the right kind of therapy, otherwise you’ll be frustrated. I tried psychoanalysis and i was just going in circles. Dialectical Gognitive therapy (or something like that) is the one i chose"
mentalhealth,fakkwio,t3_e9oog7,1576168841.0,"I would recommend therapy.. but it’s tricky because when you overthink stuff so much you get bored of talking it out..I know that happened to me at least.. but try making it a two way conversation so he/she can wake you up to reality. I’m currently struggling with anhedonia, depression and isolation myself, but therapy started to work. Not from beginning obviously. Its been almost 6 months from my first ever consultation but i feel like its getting better."
NoFap,faa3e8l,t3_e7xpzf,1575901108.0,Im into nofap also. But can we stop and think of 21st century  problems? Men thinking they should stop having sex with themselves? Where is human kind going
GetStudying,f9sltg8,t3_e6q390,1575594850.0,Thought of it but im too self conscious. Is there an app on phone or smth?
NoFap,f9meehk,t1_f9ma114,1575454637.0,Hang in there day 3 for me
NoFap,f9jcbpt,t1_f9j3vc1,1575366892.0,Exactly!! Going on nofap for better sex? Its like going out of your shell to be a fuckboy. Still as shameful
mentalhealth,f9jbuqf,t3_e4v4op,1575366143.0,I do sometimes because I think as their son I was supposed to be their greatest joy but instead they’re so much better without me. I’m lucky to have compassionate parents and they try their best
mentalhealth,f9i28pv,t3_e4z4oa,1575326550.0,I did just set up a meeting with a psychotherapist to figure it out. Every sentence of your post described me accurately. I’m hopeful now reading your story thanks

mentalhealth,f9gio48,t3_e4z4oa,1575299951.0,"It’s funny I’m 20 years old now and I’m experiencing this hard mode for 11 months now. I haven’t gone out in a week or so because I’m so ashamed I honestly wish I wouldn’t have to interract with anyone. Problem is, it affects you long term -I almost lost all my friends (not that many to begin with)- and my parents say they feel like they don’t know me anymore. I have to go to lectures this week though so I have to suck that up. How did you go through it all? Aka help 😂"
mentalhealth,f9ggzqg,t3_e4v4op,1575299172.0,"My parents still try to talk to me but I usually dont know what to say other than ok/yes/no/i dont know. I can feel their life being sucked out of them when they talk to me. In this case, maybe it’s better to just not talk that much"
