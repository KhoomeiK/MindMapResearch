auditing,f5xy80a,t1_f5xxtwt,1572548023.0,"Currently north of Houston Tx, moving to the Dallas area from May-September, and then making a more permanent move to the Austin area in September. I’m honestly open to industry.  I’d be happy with just about industry because I love the audit work itself. If I get to audit I’ll be happy regardless of industry."
depression,f3a8iiq,t1_f3a89m0,1570764497.0,"I was taking them together. I had a lot of side effects and the doctor didn’t know which one it was so he stopped the Effexor and it got a lot better. I stopped having such horrible dry mouth, sweating, low sex drive, and other things like that. Honestly stopping it changed nothing except side effects. It wasn’t doing anything for my anxiety depression or ADHD. Now I take extended release wellbutrin and Adderall and it’s a great combo for me"
depression,f3a7xpl,t3_dg94ky,1570764055.0,I take Wellbutrin and love it Effexor did nothing for me but cause problems
depression,f2ywnqn,t1_f2yvplm,1570500216.0,It’s just shitty that I’m expected to get along with them. I’ve tried to spend time with her even though I live three hours away. I’m the only one who’s made an effort to reach out and connect. I’m expected to be nice and spend time with them and do stuff for them but they won’t even take the time to know basic things about me. It’s not about the card it’s about the fact that they don’t care to know me and only include me in certain things because they think they’re obligated.
depression,ez60k8f,t3_d01jay,1567707656.0,I prefer to deal with everything by myself. Every time I’ve opened up it either makes the situation worse or they just say “I’m sorry” and change the subject. It’s not worth it to say anything. I’ve also stopped answering the question “why didn’t you tell me?” Because you don’t care and you say things that don’t help.
adderall,ez1wgtp,t3_czpmpt,1567651122.0,If I take my meds I eat like a normal person and stay within a good calorie range. I don’t feel like I eat a whole lot more when I don’t take it but I definitely consume more calories. Basically I eat stuff that’s really bad for me and I always get a stomach ache from it. Also idk if this happens to anyone else but some days I have no appetite. I know I need to eat so I’ll make myself eat something but every time I force myself to eat when I’m not hungry my stomach will hurt pretty bad.
depression,ey778xe,t3_cvunq3,1566873774.0,"We’re sick. People don’t see it so they don’t ask. If they did ask they’d be uncomfortable with the answer. We isolate ourselves because it feeds the pain. We hate doing that because we all know that it’s making us feel worse but our minds tell us to do it anyway. Isolation is our only cry for help. For someone to talk to. For someone to care. It’s the curse of our broken brains and even when the medication helps and things look up, we still aren’t free. It’s always there no matter how happy we think we are and it eats us alive when we’re down."
adderall,exldryl,t3_ctgt22,1566411058.0,My boyfriend takes 40mg Vyvanse everyday and at first he’s ok but then he gets REALLY irritable. Every little thing will make him mad. I would say annoyed but it goes beyond annoyance. He actually gets pissed about stuff. My dog can come up to him when he doesn’t want her to and he’ll get pissed off about it when it’s an annoyance at the most. I personally don’t enjoy being around him when he takes vyvanse for that particular reason. He’s usually at work when he’s like that so it’s not bad but I definitely notice a mood change.
depression,ewza0ax,t3_cqqe91,1565893125.0,That’s amazing! I completely understand how excited you are. I’m finally going back to school too. Depression is an asshole but you killed it. I hope you have a great school experience now!
adderall,ewtd4ua,t3_cpz6wn,1565742493.0,You can have vitamin C just don’t have any within a couple hours of your dose. My pharmacist said it’s off limits the hour before and the hour after my dose but anything other than that is fair game.
depression,ewtclaa,t3_cpvwhh,1565742134.0,Yes. The worst part is that no body believes you when you’re high functioning. They think that it’s not that bad cuz you’re still doing this and that. I think high functioning people suffer more. We suffer alone because people brush us off. We’re just over dramatic and no one believes us from the get go because they can’t see that the person on the surface ISNT happy or normal. They can’t see past the image we display. Not only is it lonely but it’s exhausting as hell. You spend all that energy making it look like you’re ok and then have to go home and hate yourself alone until you’re able to fall asleep. Sleep is my only safe haven.
adderall,ew5cjcb,t3_cmvcgj,1565132965.0,Now that you mention it I notice that I sweat like crazy for no reason and even when I use antiperspirant and deodorant sometimes I catch a whiff of myself and realize how rank I smell
adderall,ew5c834,t3_cmu6kp,1565132749.0,I love my psychiatrist. We’ve always been a team and had a good doctor patient relationship. He doesn’t drug test me. There are times where I’ll forget to take my meds but I’ll forget both not just my Adderall. I’ve never given or sold Adderall and because of the level of trust and honesty I’ve had with my doctor he believes that I don’t abuse my meds. I never have the need to ask for my meds early. Idk maybe my doctor is just lax.
adderall,ew4lswt,t3_cmdkp6,1565113347.0,I got approval from my dean hopefully I’ll get an email saying I’m admitted soon 🤞🏻
adderall,ew2zh14,t1_ew2zejd,1565059824.0,I’ve been working on my study skills for sure
adderall,ew259uj,t1_ew2580k,1565038558.0,Thank you that means so much to me
depression,etnm5jy,t3_ccjql1,1562991697.0,I take 450mg Wellbutrin XR everyday I used to take 150 but it wasn’t extended release and I would feel exactly as you’re describing. Since it only lasted for a few hours it didn’t help me much. Most of the time I just got side effects and no benefit. I told my doctor about it and he suggested going up on the dose and trying extended release so I wouldn’t “come down” every day. I went up to 300mg XR and that was loads better. I actually felt normal. Lately though I’ve been down and feeling shitty so my doctor gave me an extra 150mg XR to help. It’s slow but I think it’s helping a little more every day. You might want to talk to your prescriber about what’s going on and find a good solution together.
adderall,ethiy55,t1_etgw51n,1562816860.0,I feel like smoothies would be a good idea cuz they’re so versatile but meal prep doesn’t sound like an option for me. I only say that because if I end up not wanting what I prepped I won’t eat. It’s more than likely that I won’t want that food when the time comes and id hate to waste food like that. With the smoothies I can keep everything frozen and just use what I want when I want it. The only issue with that is I normally want to eat while I’m at work. For whatever reason that’s the golden time so I need things that’ll keep. I prefer smoothies fresh because they get kinda weird after a little bit.
adderall,essadx0,t3_c8z3u7,1562248196.0,Hope your doctor doesn’t test you to make sure you’re taking the medication. My doctor requires bloodwork to verify that I’m not abusing or selling my medication. They can tell how much is in your system and when it doesn’t line up that’ll be an issue.
adderall,esllaz5,t1_esjzegp,1562087628.0,I take my meds first thing when I wake up and just wait for the right time to present itself. I keep stuff like juice and cliff bars and meal replacement cookies with me just in case. My meds make me thirsty so I really only drink water. After I stopped drinking milk I became lactose intolerant so I can’t do most protein/meal replacement shakes.
adderall,esjrwja,t3_c7naor,1562040292.0,I think you need to talk to your doctor and let them know what’s going on. They can help find a solution. Your body can’t handle that much in such a short time. I don’t want you to hurt yourself or cause permanent damage to your organs. I know this is gonna sound dumb but they make containers for junk food that lock for a certain amount of time. They can’t be opened unless you break the container. You could keep your medicine in one of those to keep you from absentmindedly reaching for the medicine throughout the day. You’ll just have to be strong enough to only grab what you’re supposed to take and not more. If that’s hard you could have someone you trust give you the exact amount you need and then lock it back up in the container. It’s not a perfect solution but it might help. But please talk to your doctor no matter what you do.
adderall,esjq6c9,t3_c7a5vd,1562039033.0,"I’ve always been a little obsessive about spelling errors but when I take Adderall I notice it more. If I misspell a word I have to erase the whole word and start over. I’ve done this for years but it’s amplified on Adderall. I also think I’m hyper aware of sensations, sounds, and smells. I can’t handle pain (I have a lot of tattoos) like I used to because I can’t distract myself. I fixate on the sensation. I have to wear a watch at work and I had to throw away my analog watch and buy a digital watch because I couldn’t stand the ticking. No matter where the watch was all I heard was ticking. Even if it was on my nightstand. Repetitive sounds like that drive me up the wall now. I can’t stop thinking about it and obsess over it so it’s all I can focus on and it’s all I hear. As for the smells idk if I’m smelling things that aren’t there or if I’ve just become more aware of smells. Who knows."
adderall,esjllmb,t3_c82n7p,1562035888.0,I’ll get a feeling in my stomach that’s super confusing. I can’t tell if my stomach hurts or if I’m just hungry. I’ll go look for food but if nothing interests me I walk away. I don’t force myself to eat cuz I don’t wanna have a stomach ache. I have noticed that smells are very off putting to me on Adderall. I can’t stand the smell of Ranch dressing it makes me nauseous.
adderall,esjgtad,t3_c81gk9,1562032839.0,Call your prescriber and tell them the situation they can send an electronic one time prescription to the pharmacy where you are
