AskMen,fnl8xn8,t1_fnl6kyx,1587049240.0,"These little tricks can really make math easier.

Now the really fun part is not just knowing this trick but knowing why this trick works. How can you be sure that there is not a number, which is not divisible by 3 but its checksum is. How can you know this trick is true for all integers, no matter how big they are? We can't check all numbers because they are infinite. And we can't rely that it will work because it works for every number we checked. Maybe this rule is not true for all numbers.
That is the point we have to give an actual proof to show our rule is working not just for small numbers but for all numbers no matter how big they may are.

The beauty about math is, we are able to give proof for statements and if the proof is logical correct, There is no doubt about the statement being true or not."

Pretty easy way to check but do you know why this works? Could you come up with a similar rule for 11 or 7?
