On thing that worked well for one family i worked for- id read to him and then hed 'help me'  start preheating the oven,  and at tye same time grab his sippy cup. Take him to the crib, a few minutes of back rubbing, and then the oven would beep, "" oh lemme go put tge food in ill be back"" kids older ( 1.5-2),and can understand, so no crying and sometimes would fall asleep, if not here i come right back after putting food in ( so they can trust),, more back rubs, oh gotta go turn the oven off, and again hopefully they trust you will return so dont cry.

BPD,faanvut,t1_fa9fg67,1575911260.0,"Have i read about co dependency? I guess not. Ive read about interdependence and cultural norms in places....

I guess the issue is the word excessive.
In western culture its pretty expected that a 2 year pld would onow how to use a fork and feed themselves. If you teach a class of 2s you would expect most western children to have the independent skills to do this at 2.5....
But not all cultures value independence the same. 
Ive noticed that particularly in familys where there is generational housing ( the kids live with mom dad grandparents and even some aunts or something.
Those kids often dont know how at 2.5 but this is NOT considered bad. The act of feeding a child is consided a form of showing love in some cultures. Its that cultues norm that kids dont self feed till older ( i dont claim to know a ton of even more then a hanful of things about this culture as ut is not my own but tshes are my understandings) 

A teacher who doesnt know that that is culturally appropriate for them might think they are babying him, lazy, or ""exsessive"" But in reality its just a diffrent set of values. Judging without knowing cultural implications can be very harmful. 
Same situation but for say walking into the school ive legit heard teachers say "" they can walk! Why are rhey caring them""..... cause they love them and dont think independence is important the way the teacher obviously does. 

Now, to your other questions -,every emtional need... no. Lots of them, hes my husband,  but not all. Do i get upset when he cant help me? Yes. His own stuff going on? Idk what stuff does he have that more important than helping with his own kid? I dont really understand this one maybe? 

Im extremely lucky because i am basically on the cusp of recovery / no longer having bpd. I wouldnt say i dont have it anymore yet because if i was to go though even a smallish trama i think most of my recovery would be undone pretty quickly. But thanks to having a stable relationship i no longer suffer regularly.

Not know what to do with myself : i dont think i ever had this issue even when deeply affected by bpd. I do have things i enjoy, plus loads of things that need done to do. 
 But is he most is my support? Uh probably most, but not all. Id certainly be lost without him, but hes my HUSBAND and father of my child. Not a guy ive been dating 3 weeks.......... 
So ofcourse hes my main support? 
I dont think anyone whos married, bpd or not would say otherwise? 

Do i watch my phone all day for his texts? And not living life.  When my bpd was worse yes. But since we have neen married?  Now Only if we were fighting,  ( aprox 2 days a month) will this be the case for me. It is hard on rhose days for me to get stuff done, but like the kids fed and in a clean dipaer and needs are met, but i probably am not focusing in playing while upset from a fight.

Obsessed with taking care if them so that you neglet your own needs? No...... 
For my kid sure, but not my husband. 

Does he encourage me to be dependent? I mean as a preschool teacher i legit couldnt support myself financially so if encouraging me to follow my passion of teaching means hes doing that then.... sure. But no he encourages me to do things alone that i dont like doing/ cause me anxiety."
BPD,fa9b2ws,t1_fa91qrl,1575867445.0,"Right im really not getting this. My grandparents depend on each other.

Did she not once depend on him?  If not he would need to be in a home.....all because he cant cook and isnt going to learn in his 80s? 

I depend on my husband .... and he depends on me
My child depends on me... one day ill probably depend on him. 
Codependency is apart of healthy life.

You really want to let your supply regulate, which takes about 6 weeks. 

If breastfeeding is going well and you wont be apart for awile I would pump as little as possible-- yes a small stash is good but you should slowly build it so your body doesn't think its feed twins. Clogs are very painful and I had several early on because I created a oversupply by pumping to much.

Edit: I see hes having some trouble. In that case I would only try to pump slightly more then what he ate at the last bottle feed. 
Example: 
Breastfeed, offer 2oz top up bottle, pump 2,-3 oz
Breastfeed, offer 1 oz top up, pump 1-2 oz. 

It took us about 6 weeks to nurse without the shield.  Then by 8 weeks I didnt have to top off anymore :)!"
