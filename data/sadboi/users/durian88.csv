depression,ey7qnbm,t1_ey7dtt5,1566895739.0,">Hey, was just looking through the archives of r/depression looking for book recs too. Here are a few that I've gotten a lot out of:  
>  
>Awareness by Anthony De Mello- about shifting perspective on a variety of issues in an individual's life. It's composed of really short chapters so I read one before bed everynight and if I didn't feel like reading anything else I'd pick it up for a few mins. I got a lot out of it and think about some of his advice/ wisdom all the time.  
>  
>How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie- obvious one if your struggling with socially anxiety or lack fulfilling relationships. IMO it's extremely well known for a good reason- lots of good advice and extremely easy to read.  
>  
>The Noonday Demon by Andrew Solomon- just started reading this the other day and Solomon is a master at describing depression. The book isn't necessarily self-help but more about understanding depression in medical, cultural, and societal terms. I've gotten a lot out of it so far for the same reason that I come to r/depression- to feel less alone in how I feel.  
>  
>How to Stop Worrying and Start Living by Dale Carnegie- I have not read this yet but see it mentioned all the time as a good go-to anxiety book. Hope to read at some point since I'm a fan of Dale Carnegie.  
>  
>Hope that helps- reading has

depression,ewuh5th,t1_ewrujsb,1565780919.0,"I feel like I am in your shoes. I am sensitive and so any behavior that doesn’t match to my ideal I take personally, despite me doing the same and being a hypocrite. Then I become a depressed sloth and don’t want to be happy again. I just cant wrap my head around why this happens but I am definitely suffering from depression. 

I moved back in with mom too after college and it’s been 5 years of me falling deeper and deeper into depression. You’re right, health is more valuable than wealth. But I am also lost career wise and don’t want to bring this confusion/depression to another city while being completely alone."
depression,ewugyhs,t1_ews74gh,1565780689.0,"Thank you for sharing.

I can’t say I believe everything you say. Especially the part about my friends being abusive. The few friends I have left in my life are also there for me during my most depressed state. But because I’m highly sensitive I take any lacking quality or unintentionally dismissive behavior of theirs as personally disrespecting me. My friend runs late for our hangout and I get upset, but I run late on her all the time too. 

I can agree that I need a larger change than just baby steps. But why is that? Is there a science to why this is? I am unemployed at the moment and I know I use that to stay in my comfort zone. But I don’t want to continue to be lost in my career while living in another city away from family and friends. I am studying part time for a career change but my resume isn’t outstanding. I can work on projects to increase my hiring potential but I have depression and lack the motivation. I’ve been unemployed about half a year now after quitting my contract job early because they were treating us like second class employees despite being a major tech company. Lately I’ve just been sleeping a lot and feeling guilty about spending money."

AskReddit,ewufx9t,t1_ewr3lue,1565779484.0,"I heard about this too, and I think this applies to self-abuse as well. When someone is in a abusive relationship or abusive with themselves (self harm due to depression, etc), someone doesn’t want to hear their friends say they’re not there for them if this continues. I hate that motivational quote going about online saying “If my friends don’t take my advice and keep doing what they’re doing, our friendship is over!” Like hello! This isn’t about you. It’s about your friend who needs someone to give them a safe space to talk and eventually run away to. If friends are so impatient that they take your mess ups too personally and doesnt understand that you didn’t know how or we’re scared to take control, they’re not your friend to begin with. People in abusive situations should not be further isolated. They need help and they need to know people are there for them."

Are there any specific features you’re looking for?
changemyview,ewr0y5x,t3_cpoflz,1565689263.0,"I think makeup serves the purpose of accentuating someone’s features as a work of art. It helps someone stand out in a crowd, like dying your hair or wearing clothes that flatter you. Makeup helps to bring out someone’s eyes, sharpens their cheekbones, etc. Features that someone wants to show off. And in OP’s case I don’t think it’s wrong to hide acne. Acne is temporary so why feel the need to be aware of it constantly?

People who act like women are strategizing to deceive men with makeup need to get off their high horse. So what if she wants to wear makeup to make herself feel good? Women don’t expect people to believe they have 2 inch eyelashes or blue eyelids. It’s just a work of art. If people were really concerned about unrealistic beauty standards they should consider the fact that most male up companies are actually owned by men. They’re the ones perpetuating this unrealistic beauty standard."

I still thought it was going well but moving too fast so I asked for space for about a week, during which he didn’t text me. I told myself he was respecting my space as he was a very emotionally intelligent guy. But deep down I knew something was up. I went out with him one final time, during which he seemed tired but we made out in the end anyway. After that he doesn’t respond to my texts and dumps me via text a few days later, saying he needed to work on himself.

Wouldn't you want to be with someone you think has the best personality of all the people you've dated? Isn't that what we're striving for? If you're not, I don't see why you haven't split up and moved on."
dating,ewo109z,t3_cp7q8p,1565600381.0,"It sounds like you're putting too much pressure on one person to validate you. I can see that in the title itself. Why not validate yourself? You say that tall women or women who are 8 or a 9 wouldn't consider you as a date. Why not? Who's telling you you can't ask these women out? If these women weren't around would you call yourself a 8 or a 9? Maybe you can ask your gay friends why they find you attractive and find that it's because you can feel comfortable around them, knowing you don't pressure yourself to find a date with them.

It also sounds like you're overgeneralizing the same group of people based on their appearance, the same ones who you feel are generalizing about you based on your appearance. Not all women who are an 8 or 9 see only appearances. Not all women wear makeup and hide their physical ""flaws"". Understand that there are many types of women and they're not all superficial like you say. Get yourself out of this unhealthy self-fulfilling mindset of low self-confidence and thinking your environment is working against you.

My advice is to start empowering yourself and finding your personality and confidence again. Don't put this at the hands of a person who has every right to leave you for whatever reason you may or may not find valid. It's up to ourselves to give ourselves confidence and validation. After that, find a way to showcase your personality and interests in places not so heavily reliant on appearances. We can all agree that online dating is shallow. So go to hobby groups or events that you enjoy where you'll be surrounded by people you enjoy and will enjoy being around you.

Everyone has things to work on to deem themselves ""date-able."" But it all comes down to self-confidence and being your own person. See this as a blessing for you to see yourself as more than just how tall you are. There are people shorter than you with great personalities and confidence and there are people taller than you with terrible personalities. There are so-called physically unattractive people and attractive people by Euro-centric standards but attraction is all relative. In the end, everyone faces the very real possibility of getting dumped when they show their true selves. In the end, no one wants to be around someone who complains a lot (I learned the hard way) and no one should feel the burden of constantly validating their partner due to their low self-confidence. Be good to yourself man. You deserve it. All the superficial stuff can wait."

I assume I’m not feminine or loud or impressionable enough to make anyone do a double take. At the same time I’m too shy to just talk to a cute person on the street, so I guess it goes both ways. Maybe that’s why I find more confidence in online dating as an introvert, but only if there are profiles displayed. I’d rather know a little bit about someone before being asked or asking them out. Otherwise I’m just coming up with lame ice breakers and trying to focus on their appearance to stay interested, which doesn’t work out for me.

As someone who also got into their first relationship at 26, trust me when I say it’s not worth it. It’s not worth the crying, flinching, and loss of self worth over someone who was nice months and months ago. Every relationship has a honeymoon period. I’m sure if there wasn’t, you wouldn’t have been in a relationship. But not all relationships last and you can learn from each experience.

I relate to your experience because for that one week, I was coming up with self-belittling explanations for how our dates could be so great and how he could be so affectionate until a sudden change of heart. Good on you for sending him a final text in my opinion. We shouldn’t normalize this behavior as excusable. Some of my friends just say some guys have a different standard level of affection for anyone they even sorta like, while other friends told me I shouldn’t expect a clear explanation so I should just move on. But I asked and even though I came to realize the split was more about him than me, I now need the time to recover from that week’s worth of self-torture. 

I can’t imagine how getting completely ghosted by someone you really like would feel. It’s completely disrespectful to do to another human being. Maybe people do it to feel a sense of control over the situation or over someone else’s emotions.

Sorry if this just seems like rambling, but I really do sympathize with your spiraling of why he left. Someone out there will treat you better, whether it be another potential someone or yourself."

logodesign,evzjng1,t3_clx9al,1564959333.0,B or C because it looks most balanced and doesn’t look like “naven.” I don’t think viewers will realize it’s suppose to be an “h” because the design only repeats at the end of the logo
depression,evzijc6,t3_clzejo,1564958509.0,"Same as OP. I’ve spent plenty of time “trying to find myself” by solo traveling or eating at restaurants alone. I can’t compare that to anything because I hardly travel with friends or go out to eat with them because there’s always a voice telling me they don’t want to be around me or that I’ll feel lonely again once they leave. But I’m both tired of being alone and tired of feeling anxious around other people. The only interaction I find appealing is at surface level and fleeting, with people who are paid to be nice to customers."
aww,evzi5ye,t1_evz9jeu,1564958236.0,I’m a dog mom and I’m cringing
sex,evzh7ig,t1_evzgavm,1564957551.0,Maybe this is a bigger question about the thread in general. I was curious if there’s a difference between consensual forced orgasm and nonconsentual sex. To me consensual forced orgasm is more an oxymoron that I’m not sure can really exist.

sex,evzd7rq,t1_evyqhu0,1564954732.0,"If I read this right, you’re saying there’s no such thing as consensual forced orgasm, correct?"
sex,evzckg7,t3_cm0cg7,1564954288.0,I share same concerns with OP. I recently started having sex and want to explore more. How many times or after how many partners should someone get tested?
dating_advice,evzal2r,t3_clzmss,1564952937.0,"This definitely should be taken with a grain of salt as it varies with every person but my friend says “for every month you’re together, you need one week to get over them.” Maybe that’s somewhat the time period you need to know if you’re moving too quick or are hung up for too long on someone and need support. Maybe this equation doesn’t apply here cuz it sounds like you’re over your ex.

With that, I started dating someone a month after breaking it off with someone I saw for 10 months. I told myself my ex was mean and so I felt empowered, invincible, and willing to be vulnerable again afterwards. I lucked out with the first guy I met with from online dating and we saw each other for an amazing two weeks. During the middle of it I asked for space because with the recent break up and hearing about my friend possibly moving, I felt like my foundation was falling apart and needed to work on myself and my anxiety. I hadn’t completely fixed those things but after about 5 days of no contact we met for our 4th date, after which he dumped me via text. I was completely devastated. I realized I never could’ve loved my ex but I could’ve loved the recent guy. According to the “equation” I should’ve been over him by 2 days after breaking up. But I realized the unhealthy obsession that came after was also due to constantly seeking validation from feeling neglected like when my dad left me as a kid. This then led to me reaching out to find a therapist again. 

I guess TLDR is to be completely sure you’re not carrying a weight on your shoulders, whether it be from your past or your previous relationships before you jump into the next one. Take time to work on yourself and you might come across someone naturally."
