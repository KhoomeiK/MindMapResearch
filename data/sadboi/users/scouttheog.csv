As for academic stuff, your teachers are required to accommodate you so don't let them pull any bs.

EatingDisorders,f6hcs9x,t1_f6dndck,1572843291.0,"I think you'd benefit from Tabatha Farrar on YouTube. She has mentioned SO many times that you don't need to count calories to make sure you eat enough. If you think you didn't eat enough today, eat more. That's it, you don't need an app to tell you that. Easier said than done of course but I think it's true that counting is more on he disordered side than the helpful side."
ChronicPain,f66bjzd,t3_dqhky5,1572709341.0,"The article was pretty long so here's my take:


I think what the article is trying to get at is gabapentin was made for a certain category of pain but we are using it for other stuff because of rumors that it does other things, basically. It has a relatively high chance of working if it's for seizures or pain, but with other stuff we are legit guessing, because we never did trials for things like anxiety.


I'd like to add that I was offered a gabapentin prescription four times by different doctors, and at the local behavioral health unit if you walk up to a nurse and say you're anxious it's the first medication they offer. That's how easy it is to get. So imo the reason we are seeing med abuse and bad side effects pop up so much is because of the sheer amount of people being prescribed gabapentin right now"
EatingDisorders,f5qxbgj,t3_donjt6,1572384618.0,I would say you definitely have disordered behavior but it's not BED. The losing weight by heavy restriction is what makes me think it's not. 50 lbs in 3 months is a LOT. That's like double what most people would consider the max amount you're supposed to lose in 3 months. (2 lbs a week is the max)
EatingDisorders,f5bwj37,t3_dnbmlm,1572126720.0,"This is not BED. You try to compensate by starving, and you restrict a lot. The binges are most likely caused by the restriction the rest of the time. You're starving, so when you eat you over-eat, then feel bad because you're not restricting, so you try again, over and over. Also, recovery often means binging a lot because your body has been suppressed for a while. It wants extra just in case you go back into starving mode. That's not BED either. That's your body trying to make up for all the lost calories from before. Most people recovering from anorexia or other restricting disorders find out that after they binge for a while, their body calms down because it realizes you're not going to starve any more, and you end up at normal amounts of food again.


Basically, it's normal to binge after a long time restricting because the starving is so forced and unnatural for your body"
EatingDisorders,f5bu10x,t3_dnbm2j,1572125896.0,"Okay easier said than done but: don't worry about your size, it doesn't matter. Your body will decide when it's done. It may keep more fat that you want, but your body doesn't care what you want. It will settle wherever is best for you specifically. Sometimes people's bodies end up conventionally attractive, sometimes it's not. You don't get to choose. Just keep doing the recovery thing and see where it takes you.

EatingDisorders,f55xov6,t3_dmva69,1572015392.0,"I think it would help if your mother also went to therapy. Seems like she has a pretty skewed view and maybe some disordered behavior herself. You said you threw up at the table and she considered it a nice family meal. You were hospitalized and she still thinks it's okay to comment on your appearance and food. These are not normal or acceptable behaviors when your kid has an eating disorder. Even if she thinks it's helpful, i.e ""if I tell her shes too thin she will want to gain"" it is damaging and you would both benefit from her going to therapy and learning what is helpful and good."
ChronicPain,f4yoj9h,t3_dlzdvy,1571881378.0,"Maybe you need to better communicate what your pain is like, or the struggle, etc. If you are working, doing chores, and taking care of a child it may seem like you're okay because you can do so many things.

ChronicPain,f4yn6c0,t3_dm3pb4,1571880437.0,"I think this is a very common side effect, a lot of people I know have mentioned it.

EatingDisorders,f4wzzyj,t3_dls2lg,1571861251.0,"I agree with the other comments that a meal plan can be helpful in the beginning, but over time you shouldn't need it. It can become your new safe thing: It's okay to eat, but ONLY if it's at the approved time, or the approved amount, etc. At that point it's holding you back. So watch out for that as you progress. The food obsession will go away naturally as your body is no longer in calorie deficit, so if you focus on your own nutrition for a while (very difficult, I know) it will become easier and easier to ignore your boyfriends food habits"
