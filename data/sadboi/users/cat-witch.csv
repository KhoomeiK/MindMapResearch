How do I go about raising this security issue to HR? Will they expect me to have already raised the issue to my regional manager before coming to them? I certainly can raise it to him first, but I know he’s gonna make excuses for it and not do anything substantial to consider my point so I kind of feel silly wasting the time to even try."
AskHR,fjbuwuy,t1_fjbtwxh,1583201962.0,"Well, kind of. It’s not that the workload is too much, it’s that we can’t control how much time we take with a client, and appointment times aren’t given to the clients, so its first come first serve, meaning that if all of our employees are already with clients, then the rest of the clients have to wait in the waiting room until a client leaves so an employee can become available to take them. 
So we need more people scheduled for each shift because the problem is that we need more employees present to help the clients that come in. 

It isn’t a normal workload issue because it isn’t something that can be taken on by the same staff members later in the day after we close, it’s an in-the-moment staff shortage problem."

either way, i was trying to help you understand how the days actually work because i know the doctors don’t explain it to new patients so i thought you were just confused since you gave no context. I didnt mean to offend you."
OhioMarijuana,fg0spp4,t1_fg0slpy,1580414268.0,"yeah, i tried explaining how the days work and you responded “in ohio you only get 4 90 days” which to me sounded like you were talking about the 90 day cycles on your account."
OhioMarijuana,fg0sjf5,t1_fg0sexo,1580414169.0,you’re not understanding what i’m saying. every year you go back to the doctor and they give you ur new 90 day fills. but that’s not even what we’re talking about anyways so i don’t understand why you’re even talking about how many fills you get?
OhioMarijuana,fg0sboh,t1_fg0rze7,1580414050.0,"since you edited ur response after i already responded, what do u mean “you only get 4 90 days??” for the year sure, but every year you go back and get more from your doctor. But even in your second year you still have to wait for last years purchases to grow 90 days old and fall off your history, giving you those days back. Ask a dispensary worker."
OhioMarijuana,fg0rwfo,t1_fg0ri4o,1580413815.0,"Ohio’s “90 day allotment” is a rolling period. It’s extremely hard to explain, but what i said above is true, I know it because i’ve had my card for multiple “90 day fill cycles” now, so i’ve had to slowly learn the rules by talking to dispensary workers."
OhioMarijuana,fg0qd1x,t3_ew9zy1,1580412964.0,"everyone’s 90 day period is different, & also you don’t just get a new full 90 days everytime you go into a new period. you still have to wait for your old purchases to be 90 days old so they’ll fall off your history and you’ll get that allotment back."

witchcraft,fg0pl2r,t3_ew2w2l,1580412530.0,"as a fellow weed witch, this is too fucking funny"
OhioMarijuana,ffsbmg0,t3_euw1zg,1580177852.0,"hahaha fucking idiots. these buildings are so secure you need a key card to get through every door, and only areas without product are allowed to have windows, so of course they werent gonna be able to get anything lolll the article says they only made it as far as the lobby!!!

also, these dispos are required to have like 50 cameras on the outside of the building so that every angle is visible, so the suspects are gonna get caught quick as hell. even if they wore face masks they’ll still get a license plate or something to identify them bc they are HD cameras, not the shitty ones that retail stores use. hopefully now ppl will realize how dumb it is to attempt something like this bc ur gonna get charged for it and ur not even gonna be able to get ur hands on any product to show for it."
OhioMarijuana,ffsanis,t1_ffsagrh,1580177204.0,"yep sounds about right! they always immediately do the new ones but for the renewals they fuck you over for some reason. its like they only care ab getting ppl in there and not retaining their already existing client base. I’m glad you had a good experience though, hopefully they get it all figured out before u have to worry about your renewal!"
OhioMarijuana,ffmg1i7,t3_eu6s9i,1580054192.0,Ohio Marijuana Card is the most expensive doctor office in ohio and somehow they’re the shittiest too. I can’t tell u how many patients i’ve heard ab going to their renewal and having to wait up to a week for them to upload the recommendation because they over schedule so they have way too many patients to take care of but for some reason they’re still accepting new patients. It’s honestly a shit show. I would find somewhere cheaper to go like ohio green team. they only charge $100
