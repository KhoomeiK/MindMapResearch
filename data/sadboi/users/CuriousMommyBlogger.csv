AskReddit,foyhdxf,t3_ga4gjx,1588172557.0,"Wow I have never shared this story with anyone but my boyfriend. I was around 7 or 8 when my mom, sister, and I would go for walks each summer evening before bedtime. One time at the corner a man on a bicycle stopped completely and was just staring me dead in the eye. I kid you not this man looked exactly like Mr Bean aka Rowan Atkinson. I asked both my mom and sister if they could see him and they both said no. I said how could you not? He‚Äôs staring right at us!? I was crying my eyes out as he just kept staring and no one noticed. 

Till this day I cannot watch anything with Rowan in it and my mom and sis still dont know what I was talking about. Who the fuck was this man?"
