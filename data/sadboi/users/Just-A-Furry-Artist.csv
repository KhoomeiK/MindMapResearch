I mean-

It’s a horror game. It’s *supposed* to be dark."
depression_help,fkli3o1,t3_fj7ezc,1584306765.0,"I’m so sorry, but I want you to know that your not alone. I recently cut up my arm about three weeks ago, and that was my first time as well. I understand that the pain feels good at the moment, but once (and if) it scars you’ll realize that it wasn’t worth it. It can be hard to resist the temptation to do it again, but don’t give in. 

Have you ever heard of the butterfly challenge? If not, let me explain. It’s a coping method for really any type of self-harm. Your supposed to draw a butterfly on your wrist, and have it represent someone you love in your life, and if you cut yourself/bruise yourself/hurt yourself in anyway, the butterfly on your wrist “dies.” It may sound somewhat stupid, I’m not really sure, but it helped me a lot, so maybe you could give it a shot.

Remember that it’s not just your body your hurting; it’s *you* your hurting. Sometimes when cutting or harming yourself in anyway, it’s easy to forget that. I also encourage you to tell your parents if you haven’t already. It can be hard to do that, but you’ll feel a million times better after. If you don’t tell them you’ll continue to feel guilty, and you’ll feel like your hiding it from them, which you are. They won’t  be mad at you for it, and if they are then that’s just BS, since they have literally no reason to be mad at you because of that.

I hope those helps, and if you ever need to talk I’m always open <3"

depression,fi29vcl,t1_fi23jl5,1582074844.0,"I’ve been offered support so many different times, and every single time it did nothing except make me feel worse, knowing that no matter what people do, I’ll always be sad. I go to therapy but it doesn’t help much. So now people offering support to me makes me feel awful because it’s just another reminder that they can’t help me to feel fully better.

As for the other thing, knowing that I’ll never really be able to heal myself and fully make myself feel better makes me feel terrible. I want to be happy, but I can’t without the help a therapist, and it really makes me begin to wonder why so many other people can be happy without having tips and tricks to make them feel better. It’s unfair. I’ve been feeling suicidal again lately and I can’t tell my parents. I don’t know how to tell them."

Believe me, it WILL get better. You WILL make it through this. Please don’t take your life away. It’ll affect so many people. All in negative ways. They’ll miss you so much, they’ll sob, they’ll scream, they’ll shout, they’ll blame it on themselves, they might even do it as well because the pain of you being gone will hurt so badly. I was suicidal too, I wanted to try killing myself so many times, but I always told myself, “I can’t; I have so much to live for. My friends, family, my pets, etc.” You need to stay strong. You need to keep hope. Please don’t kill yourself. I don’t even know you but I can’t bear the fact that you might do this, I want to help. Talk to me, if it’ll help you. You are loved by at least one person. You are needed. You do have a meaning. You do have an impact. You have so much to live for. Please don’t go. I believe that you can make it through this, and I believe that you can get better. You just have to stay positive, hold onto hope, and stay strong. <3Do you want to talk about it? I’m willing to help. It’s okay to not be okay. You are loved by me and every other person who hasn’t even met you yet. You are amazing. Please don’t kill yourself, please, please, please. I'll keep you in my prayers. Your art and your dolls are outstanding. Please stay. The world needs more people like you; talented, loving, kind, caring, compassionate, and overall amazing. Outstanding. Beautiful. Humorous. Artistic. The list goes on and on and on. There’s not enough good words to describe you. It’s bringing me to tears that you will do this. You are needed by so many people. I can’t express this enough. You will regret it so much when you attempt it, you will realize that it was a bad decision. Please don’t go. I don’t know how to put this in your head to get you to understand. Don’t go. Don’t go. Don't go. The world needs you. God put you on Earth for a reason. Is there anything we can do to change your mind? I’m not sure if you’ll even see this; but please. Don’t go. Stay here. Talk to someone about it. You *WILL* get better if you stay.

depression,fdf4t89,t3_ekwbox,1578353319.0,"I can relate; 2 years ago when I first started struggling I felt so empty, alone, worthless, pathetic, etc and I didn’t see the point in even trying to get better. My mom and I would get in fights, it ended up with me screaming about how much I should just kill myself, (she almost sent me to a mental hospital) but eventually, instead of fighting she told me that this won’t last forever, and I can do certain things to make me better. I put my mind to it, and I did different things to help me get better. Some simple ones I suggest starting out with is just writing good traits about yourself everyday on a post-it-note, and hanging it up on your wall. That way when your feeling especially down, just take a look at it. You may not want to get better, but believe me, if you start doing simple things to help you over time you will begin to heal. It will be worth it in the end, and you'll be so much happier, even if you feel no desire to be happy. <3 If you ever have to talk I’m open."
