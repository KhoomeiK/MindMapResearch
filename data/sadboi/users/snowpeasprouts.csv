ptsd,ewv56la,t3_cqb6o4,1565798897.0,"Yep, have chronic pain in my chest, back and stomach since I was quite young, and only recently found out it was psychosomatic and tied to my ptsd. I can’t even lay on my stomach without feeling like im going to throw up."
SkincareAddiction,ew8gp00,t3_cn8r97,1565209320.0,"My sister had A TON of milia under her eyes and she tried everything- exfoliating, topical retinoids, chemical peels- they would always come back. The only thing that got rid of it was de-roofing from a dermatologist. However, even that option isn’t a guarantee, they told her it might come back, but so far (about 5 months now) she hasn’t seen them come back."
