Dreams,etxu6c4,t1_etme4rc,1563307438.0,"Thank you for your response!

I have really been stressed about the long distance. We lived together for seven months and now it’s going to be a month until we see each other. And I struggle with my mental health.

I don’t believe he would cheat on me. But sometimes I do feel like the distance is making us fall out of love. It’s a month, I know, but it’s been really tough. We don’t get to talk as much. I do think my subconscious sees it as a form of betrayal because sometimes it feels harder on me than him."
