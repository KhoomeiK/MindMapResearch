Sudan,fpb89gp,t1_fpb79g1,1588464225.0,"And I have another point, this is a really messed up reality that we're living in. Where we joke about our pain when we're in the presence of people, but we become serious when we're posting it on Social media for the hope that someone will care. Which isn't the right or efficient way of dealing with our mental health issues.

The only way to properly deal with it is to recognise that if you want help, you have to help yourself by recognising the good people in your life and how you'll have to be straight, and honest to them. Not waving your arms around to be seen by anybody, posting on your Twitter feed trying to fish for attention. That doesn't work. And if you don't have good people in your life, don't stop there, seek them out. It's a long hard process, but it's necessary and better than receiving no response on your ""outcry"" post."
Sudan,fpb79g1,t1_fpb03lv,1588463604.0,"Yeah I've seen some weird things on Twitter too and came to the conclusion that it's not right place for any person for that matter.

I apologize in advance as this will be semi-long.

So there's this strange phenomenon that occurs, where there's like the Sudani Sudanese people who grew up here and the diaspora Sudanese people who grew up outside of Sudan. And I've noticed a lot that there's a higher occurrence of understanding within the diaspora group, it's not complete cuz there are still close minded people here and there, but yeah.

I remember seeing two accounts of people posting about their mental illness and sufferings.

The first; it was this guy who posted a picture of an arm that was slit multiple times and had chill powder covering it. As soon as I saw it, I felt alarmed and immediately DM the person and asked if he's okay. Turns out, it wasn't his picture. But a picture of someone else who he took from and posted it for no good reason. It was triggering for me. And he couldn't care less.

The second; there was a 15 year old girl who started posting tweets about not wanting to exist or feeling overwhelmed. Which gained no attention because as you know in Twitter it's all about popularity and who's following who. None of her followers seemed to be genuine friends of hers. So she went and asked on curious cat to someone who was popular in Sudanese twitter among diaspora Sudanese. She confessed about being sad and not wanting to live any more anonymously. So the popular girl responded with ""your life matters"" and more comforting words, which then got posted on her Twitter feed. And then the followers of the popular girl saw that, and most of them responded with more comforting words and nonesense (in my opinion) like ""we care about you. We love you."" And stuff like that. In the end, the 15 year old girl DMed her and they talked it out.

Point is, it doesn't really matter where you are or what religion you follow, whether it be Muslims in Suadi or Christains in America. You will always find the messed up people on social media that do not care for sensitive topics and handle such matters responsibly. I gave up with Social Media a long time ago for that matter, it pretty much enhances the fear of trusting and seeking comfort in people. Even when there's real good people out there."

On Day 5 of the Family Initiative:

• @barana_hanabneiho team visited families in BA7RI (AL3EZBA)  , they were able to reach 19 families (total members:175), the team educated the families about COVID-19 and how to protect themselves by advising them to follow the safety protocols that were demonstrated and explained. 

These families were also provided with financial aid, to reduce their need for leaving their houses, in turn decreasing the risk of outbreak.

Thank you for your contributions and may god bless you.

Your continuous support pushes the initiative forward.

Standing Committee on Public Health (SCOPH) and Standing Committee on Human Rights and Peace (SCORP). 
Hopefully, with their contributions we'll be able to achieve more and help a wider range of families in many different aspects. 

The division of work within the initiative will be as follows:

FAH:  Administration, fundraising and coordination. 
BHO: Delivering the financial support to the families / Fundraising.
SCOPH: Health education inside and outside Khartoum. 
SCORP: Addressing disease stigma and raising awareness about the situation of people in need.

>Most people around me aren't actually passionate about what they study. Most care about dating, looks, being popular and so on.

It took me a long time to catch that but when I did it really bothers me. Because sometimes it's true and sometimes it's not. The people who are in my batch give the impression that they care about trivial things but somehow get by on studies when they need to.

>if I don't have something in common with somebody or find out they do drugs or they try to drag me to do stupid shit, I cut them off cold turkey

I do it too. And even though it seems like I'm picky, it has actually been really good for me and my relationship with my friends. So it's not necessarily a bad thing but sometimes it's not a helpful in case of conveniences. I made sure to be friends with people who reflect my characteristics when I realised that I'd rather have few good friends who drives me to achieve the person I would like to be, than get lost in try to be something else for others.

>I'm over here talking to nobody and decided to just stop having one sided friendships where I'm trying really hard and the other person doesn't give a shit.

Same. This social distancing hasn't been doing me any good. I've lost it a couple times over this issue and was driven to want to own a cat. Completely given up on trying to depend on humans for intimacy, so I decided it was a great idea to just get a cat. Except I can't because they don't allow animals in the dorm.

Anyways, point is... if you want something real and sustainable, you'd have to find the right people and that takes a whole lot of time and effort but becomes worth it in the end. Don't settle for less. And I can be your friend if you'd like. I'm 20F."

You can either talk more about it to your therapist, or talk to someone who you know will listen. Or you can talk to yourself about it. Open a page, and write down down everything about it, everything that bothers, what you think it means, what do you fear, what do you hope for yourself, what do you know for sure... etc. I keep a journal because I know that I always have to talk about everything that happens to me but most times don't have the people for it.

[Alright, I'll quickly explain Darfur before I get into it] The genocide of Darfur is one of Sudan's greatest tradgies, considering it was an induced act of violence set out by the old regime of Omar Albashir (the exiled president of 2018-19 revolution) as a means to oppress by racism and the arabization of Sudan at that time. Wow that's a lot to digest. As of now, unfortunately Darfur is still outkasted but attempts to improve is still undergoing. That being said... The rest of Sudan isn't so bad. The revolution that we just had brought out the beauty and humility of our people. We don't believe in prospering alone, we look after one another as a village. Most of the country sustains themselves by private businesses and hustling through every situation with whatever we are given in our hands.

So I grew up outside of Sudan, in Qatar where everyone lived almost equally. There was no issue of homelessness because you're allowed into Qatar for a reason. Right. So I wasn't exposed to first-hand poverty and beggars until I came to Sudan during the holidays.
Staright away as a little kind, my big heart would immediately want better for them and so I would want to start a charity, raise money, give them homes and everything to do with standard care. It's in my natural to figure out ways to help them. But as a kid my parents would try to dissuade me from doing so because of reasons I couldn't comprehend. And it troubled me to my very core but I didn't know how else to deal with it.
With the revolution that happened, I took the chance and leap of faith to run with it, without my parents permission. And in hearing people talk about experiences and their history, it put the pieces together as to why Sudan is the way it is.
And now that we're on the other side, I don't see how I can fall back into my old ways of sitting out all the chances and opportunities that I want to make to make life a little better for people.

And I was halfway, HALFWAY through the hell of my studies. The most recent finals I had, I failed it all and still kinda got away with it but now what's the point.
I was just as present as everyone in Khartoum but I left Sudan before the massacre and now I feel that guilt. And I have no one here who gets me, not even my parents bother trying. They want me to look for other alternatives, to finish off my studies even if it meant studying from the beginning.
Not the right time. Not in the right mind for any of this.
I don't know anymore.
I get it how it feels. You can talk to me anytime."
Sudan,eqze1vl,t1_eqykvzj,1560398457.0,Thank youuu 🙂
Sudan,eqr5k7l,t3_by4bj0,1560249309.0,"I'm drowning in emotions and have no support. I miss the friends that are still in Sudan, we haven't talked for a week now because it's hard to keep in contact."
Sudan,eq6f9q8,t1_eq6etan,1559828076.0,"Thank yooouuu, much appreciated 🙏🏾. Get together at first, and from there you can discuss ideas and plans. So far we are trying to see if we can raise awareness about Sudan's situation and raise money to send it to Nazim Sadig in Sudan."
Sudan,eq6ezyt,t1_eq6edel,1559827927.0,"I guess they have no political or want no political connections with Sudan, aside from a few of Qatari banks in Sudan. That's all that I know of. Qatar did stop Qatar Airways flights from flying back and forth to Sudan months ago."
Sudan,eq6enha,t1_eq6ebgq,1559827751.0,"Not that I'm aware of, and to be honest the Sudanese Community is kind of divided because there are Kezans among us and running the major associations."
Sudan,eq6cppy,t1_eq6cjov,1559826712.0,I honestly don't know. They haven't taken any public action towards or against the revolution.
