What issues or diseases they have are irrelevant if you don't like the person underneath. I don't like someone or get along with them automatically if they also have schizophrenia. I've known a few irl that imet through groups and some of them I couldn't stand at all. Some were pretty dope people. I don't think it would make much of a difference, as long as the person you're in a relationship with is understanding and willing to walk down your road with you, despite it being rocky.

That being said it might make things initially a bit easier seeing as the person who also has schizophrenia wouldn't bear that social stigma that a lot of people have towards it and odds are wouldn't need to be explained the nitty gritty of what's going on.

Sometimes it's too quiet to exercise. Sometimes I really just want to disappear and not wake up, not do anything until I'm gone.

Example of how not to think lmao I'm sorry, that's just kinda what popped in my head when I read it... Shits wild man. It's tough and not very many people understand it, or what we go through. But that's exactly right. No one cares that much about your average Joe. Neither if us have done anything to garner that kind of attention from secret groups or gangs or people. Nothings going to happen because it's just your brain overthinking things. No one's after you. With 50+ other people it could have been anyone of them he was calling out to, or even just himself. As you probably know we'll, people are weird. Could have just been a crazy dude. Or it could have just never happened in the first place.

My job exists just so I can have a plce to work, and everyone there is just there for me. But that doesn't make sense. This is a corporation. There's a ton of these stores.
