Dang, in your 30s you don't make out at the park or such places lol
""grown up"" people have their own apartment and whether you got invited or they invite you but I never go lol I know what it REALLY means ""let's watch Netflix"" 😂😂😂 so you either have money to pay the dinner and drinks and finish the date with a kiss and a ""sexy"" hug lol

Plus as I said... Guys that I've found potentially acceptable are just out of a relationship and want Fun! 
I don't really want fun, I want something effin meaningful!
The others are handsome but full of their selves and totally idiots.
And there are  the sad guys whose has no social skills/ very insecure that is really difficult to date to. Not because of them as a person, they're only hard to date since they're having self steem issues.

If some of you guys have something like that, you better sort that out instead to try to get the wrong woman for you so it ends on divorce.

And your dad, he dismissed his chance whenever you guys were little children?... No no no... You were a BABY!
And now you wished he left you guys with your mom alone?, she alone to fight for you guys ALONE as a single mom?

Is not on us children, to blame or judge our parents decisions, that's their lives and they live it as they were given their chances.
Your mom perhaps didn't wanted to leave her homeland, and your dad  sticked with you guys as  that is his responsability as a father.
Why would you take his chance to see you guys grow up and bond with you?  I guess if he choose otherwise and he had found someone else over there and ditched you guys you'd be hating on him now.

And about you coming to Germany, its your chance, take it, study, have a career and be someone of yourself, that's your life and decision to make, but as the comment above, is a developed country yes, but after the immigrant wave 5 years ago, isn't the same, there's a lot of judgment and racisim against Africans, and the chances of getting a great job aren't that high (only if you're high skilled) but sadly, you will be treated with some type of racisim,. If you think that you can put up with that, go ahead and experience, because that's what life is about.

I think you should reconsider those negatives feelings you have for someone who gave you life.
Bad feelings are a heavy weight on someone and they will drawn you.
