I trapped 19 of them over the course of about 2 years and finally have some peace. The way I did it- (and look into whether or not this is possible for you- any reader not just OP, )is to google free spay/neuter in your zip code (me/ I‚Äôm in Arizona USA) and determine whether or not there is a spay neuter clinic that will do yours for free. I always leave a donation when I bring a cat in. I‚Äôve never brought in a domestic, only feral, but If I had your problem I can‚Äôt say that I wouldnt trap the cat and have him fixed. A second option is to look into predator pee. You can purchase predatory animal urine online, spray your perimeter with it, and that should deter the neighbor cat from crossing the boundary, as well as keep your kitties within the boundary."
