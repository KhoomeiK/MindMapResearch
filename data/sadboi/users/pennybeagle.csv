I still have bouts of mild hypomania and depression, but the episodes are nowhere as bad as they used to be, and I don’t think there’s a single drug or drug combo out there that is going to completely make us “normal”.

If you have a psychiatrist/therapist, or are willing to find one, they can definitely help you have a conversation with your parents about why you need to be on meds for bipolar. I hope you and your parents can find an agreeable solution that will keep you stable and healthy!"

bipolar,foivrs6,t3_g7p3ti,1587798659.0,"Honey, no. Get off the vyvanse. It is far more unpredictable than adderall. It might just be me, but I find the combo of lamictal and adderall to be pretty smooth, and vyvanse MADE 👏🏼ME 👏🏼FUCKING 👏🏼CRAZY. Perhaps switching to adderall is something to check into if you haven’t already been prescribed it in the past. No offense, but I am too tired to read that whole spiel (honestly it’s nothing personal, I’ve had two seizures this week and really only came on here to ask a question about lamictal and diabetic seizures until I saw your post).

But yeah.  I’ve written enough of my own shit while hypomanic/manic to know that the frantic outpouring of text is a sign that something isnt quite right. This is not in your head. Imposter syndrome is quite common for those of us living with invisible mental/physical illnesses which have symptoms that cannot be measured by anyone other than ourselves and clinicians (and still, only to a certain extent).

Also, only a seriously irresponsible doctor would diagnose you with bipolar as a 15 year old if you did not show or report consistent and obvious symptoms that he/she were able to observe. The drugs for this disorder are very serious, and can drastically alter/interfere with your brain chemistry and function during one of the most crucial periods of human growth and development.

Please dm me if you need someone to talk to or want to provide a little bit of a tl;dr to see how I can help."

He’s a radiology resident and I want to make sure he’s doing okay during all this. I really hope he is.

EatingDisorders,fjezpxq,t3_fd3sdj,1583281254.0,"Yes and no. I feel recovered in the sense that I recognize that my eating disorder caused more harm than good to my body. I don’t think much anymore about restricting insulin (diabulimia) in order to lose weight when I eat something I know isn’t good for me or have been gaining weight, and I certainly don’t act on those thoughts if I do.

I do not feel I’m recovered because I still tie my worth to my weight to a certain extent.

Relapse does not mean you failed as long as you want to continue to try to get better.

Your eating disorder will be your past, and you will probably regret it. But you can’t change the past. All you can do is do better moving forward into the future and try to help someone in the situation you were once in.

I hope you find a way to heal and am sorry to hear you’re struggling so much."

I don’t like projecting and while I recognize I am doing that to a degree, but based on years of interviews with conflicting reports of Maura’s behavioral tendencies when you compare her symptoms to diagnostic criteria, it’s not implausible. Granted, I did not know her, but prior to my diagnosis I did and experienced many of the same things as Maura, so I wouldn’t rule it out entirely.
