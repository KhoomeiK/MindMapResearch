I think it’s starting to become clear that it’s been here a lot longer than it’s been diagnosed.

My son tested positive for antibodies. I know that doesn’t guarantee that that event was COVID-19- but he wasn’t in an environment where he could have been exposed between that and the quarantine because of how long he was initially sick.

His diagnosis was a “viral infection of the respiratory tract of an unknown type.” Or something like that. He had a 104 fever, which is why we went to the ER. It lowered and lasted several days. He had low oxygen,  and then a dry cough that lasted weeks. He needed a nebulizer for his medication. His doctor was dumbfounded at how the infection seemed to, “scar” his lungs, and how it took him so long to fully recover. 

They tested him for everything in the books. All were negative. 

I just don’t see what else it could have been."

AskReddit,fr0ax7v,t3_gln8tu,1589789284.0,"I was in the ER with my infant son on New Year’s Eve. We didn’t have any *confirmed* cases in my state. We were on our way to the train station to a city that ended up being the epicenter of it for our area.

On the way out the door, I realize my son is burning up. He’s been fussy for days. Low fever. A cough and some other symptoms. 

A bunch of people at our church had been sick with this weird sorta cold. Both my husband and I had it- one of our friends had it worse and said she couldn’t smell anything. It was weird. I had a sore throat that developed into a dry cough. My husband took a single day off work. And now our son-

It wasn’t bad before, but he felt warmer all of a sudden. So I took his temp.

*104 degrees-* he was five months old.

We threw the bags in the car and headed to the ER. On our way there, my son’s crying grew silent because he was fighting so hard to breathe. He hacked and coughed and cried for me to hold him.

We waited to be admitted for an hour. A little boy with a dry cough refused to wear a mask, and I held my still son against my chest, making a mental note of how far the germs could travel as the boy played on the oddly shaped furniture. The mother was on the phone with whoever stayed behind with the other kids- she was arguing that it couldn’t just be the asthma, his inhaler wasn’t helping when he got into a coughing fit, not the way it usually did.

My son would usually giggle and clap for other excited children. He slumped on my lap, sweating. He was in nothing but a diaper, with a thin blanket around his shoulders. His blanket was soaked.

When we finally went back, I held my baby down while tubes and needles were jabbed into every end of his tiny body. I wiped tears from his eyes as he screamed in pain, clawing at my face and shirt so that I’d save him, his voice hoarse and cracked as we tried test after test. 

I rocked him as the oxygen monitor dipped and raised. As the doctor stretched his head. 

“The tests are all negative- it’s not anything I’d expect. Definitely a viral infection of the respiratory tract, but I’m not sure what.”

We were sent home with the orders to return if we saw symptoms that hadn’t even stopped since we’d left the ER. I realized that the doctors weren’t concerned because they didn’t know what it was- it was on my shoulders now to protect my baby.

It took 3 days to get the fever to stay away. I slept every night sitting up, holding him, so he could breathe. I canceled his six month appointment and vaccinations. I told his doctor I didn’t want to spread whatever it was.

It took over a week for my son to recover. He wasn’t himself for a long time. And even now, his doctor is watching him to see if his lungs will fully recover. Because so far, they haven’t. It’s like they’re scarred.

This virus has been around a lot longer than I think most of us realize. My city has the second most cases in my state. The hospital I took my son to now houses children with the virus. 

Please, people, stay home if you can. If I could take back all the trauma that my son endured, I’d do it in a heartbeat. By staying home, I’m helping prevent it for *your* loved ones. Please help me.

Stay home, stay safe."

We dislike them because of the stigma that surrounds them that they’re a “cure” for deafness.

The hearing they create is a very fake, underwater sounding robotic noise. Can’t even compare to real hearing. And the success rate for them helping someone establish the ability to speak is so low that it’s hard to be approved for them.

It’s pretty common for Hearing parents to have a deaf child and install cochlear implants, declare the child cured, and never make an attempt to involve them in the Deaf culture or learn sign language. This strips away all the beautiful parts of being Deaf that we’ve worked very hard to establish. 

For centuries the Hearing treated the Deaf terribly. It was only a few generations ago that that abuse began to stop. Even today we’re subjected to cruelty and stupidity from our hearing counterparts. That’s why the Deaf cling to their identity so strongly. We have proved our capability, and it has cost a lot to do so.

When you have cochlear implants, you can’t hear, but you’re not deaf, either. It’s a weird in-between that doesn’t really “fix” anything. Especially because I’m our eyes, being deaf isn’t a problem. We’ve adapted to the world and have a way to do everything anyone else can do- we just can’t hear. 

All around, it feels like another attempt from the Hearing community to erase us, and the value we bring to the world. Granted, cochlear implants can be successful and are appreciated by many of their users who’d otherwise never have any kind of hearing, no matter how fake. And that’s important to keep in mind for myself and the other Deaf. We can’t let past mistreatments overshadow real success stories, no matter how few and far between they are.

So if it works for someone, I’m not going to be the one to crap on it. But I will remind people why they’re not a cure-all for every deaf person. 

Healing in the Deaf community is happening. And it’s happening because of the growing Kindness and understanding from the Hearing. If the Deaf can open their hearts to the Hearing, inclusiveness and community will continue to grow. I can’t wait to see the day, because I feel like it’s very near."

madlads,fqjbcqp,t1_fqj1l1b,1589407577.0,"Hi, Deaf person here to help explain this.

We don’t get, like, *angry* about cochlear implants. We get angry about how they’re used.

The Hearing community sees cochlear implants as a “cure” for deafness, but us Deaf see them as part of the problem.

For one thing, cochlear implants don’t fix deafness. They create a fake, robotic, underwater sounding, somewhat horrific sound. It’s nowhere near hearing.

For another, they’re only truly effective if they’re installed at a young age or on someone who is very newly deaf. Otherwise, you’re out of luck as far as learning speech goes. You’ll hear- but you won’t understand. The sound will go in, but it won’t mean anything to your brain. So it’ll just be a source of frustration and exhaustion.

The Deaf community doesn’t appreciate “cures” because we don’t see our difference as a disability. It’s just a difference between us and others. We can do anything anyone else can- except hear.

And for years and years we’ve had to fight to prove this. We’re only a few generations past a time where Deaf children were forced to sit on their hands in Hearing schools and lipread. When Deaf children were slapped on the wrist for signing and were ridiculed for not understanding the abusive words that were screamed in their faces.

And you’re right- most of us *don’t* care to hear. I think I would love to, but I’m happy with what I’ve got. I know there’s a lot I miss out on, and my life is harder in a few areas, but I’m externally grateful to have the life I do, and I’m used to it, frankly. Why shake things up now?

From a Deaf to a Hearing person- thank you for advocating for us and further thank you for learning our language. It’ll be people like you that help bridge the gap between our communities. Hopefully soon we’ll get along exactly the way God intended us to- not as separate peoples, but together."

Reality check time. You are not better than other people. And those who are more delayed by their disabilities are not less. I’m disappointed that as an Aspie yourself, you would speak down on those with similar struggles to you. You’re absolutely better than that.

I work with autistic children often and let me tell you- I’m glad as hell that people do this sort of thing. I’m glad that people are willing to bend the ‘rules’ and create businesses designed to hire minorities specifically. How is this not a real job? Do these people not do a necessary task at a business? Do they not fulfill a need? Are they not worthy of a job simply because they may not capable of harder work than this? 

And let’s be real here- this isn’t a workforce that depends on the most educated man in the world. You’re saying this dude should hire more qualified people? How can you be more qualified? They show up, they do their thing, they smile and enjoy themselves and are good to their customers. That’s as qualified as can be by my book.

Look- I’m sorry you have had your struggles. But if your success relies on the failure of those around you, you’re never going to find happiness in your work. You can be proud of yourself and shine *at the same time* as others around you do the same. You can have your cake and eat it, too, without shitting in other people’s.

When you talk about people this way, you don’t sound the way you think you do. You come across as arrogant and spiteful, which I doubt is how you want to sound. And I know how hard it can be to get by in this world with a disability- I’m Deaf. But at the same time, we can’t build ourselves up by throwing others down. Supporting those around us who need extra help doesn’t make us less- it makes us compassionate and kind. It makes up empathetic and loving.
