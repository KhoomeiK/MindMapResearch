PCOS,ewh2fsg,t3_co5buv,1565396176.0,"My PCOS is weird. 

I have facial hair, no periods at all but some symptoms every month and i dont ovulate either. I had other minor symptoms but nothing crazy or concerning.

I developed hypothyroidism when i was 15 after my parents separated and gained 170lbs in 3 months and delt with it until 2 years ago now. (27 now) I started loosing weight and my endocrinologist said its rare but thyroid conditions CAN reverse themselves. Mine might have been situational. I took thyroid meds for YEARS. Ever since my thyroid reversed im off medication and now that im loosing weight more easily im getting my period almost every month but i still suffer with my anxiety, depression and facial hair. If anything since my hormones are starting to level the only bad part is my facial hair getting thicker but takes longer for it to grow in.

Edited to add* i was dumb and only focused on my thyroid. I might be in for it later but i didnt get periods for close to 12 years without having to induce them with meds. Im taking care of myself now but ive never had issues with insulin resistance or anything. Which is why i said my pcos is weird."
unpopularopinion,etpnqsv,t3_ccpl69,1563060202.0,Totally agree.
DavidDobrik,esiyo20,t1_esh2n29,1562022739.0,They do know better. David has asked CONSTANTLY A MILLION TIMES to NEVER come to his house. He says hes more than happy to mess around/take pics/ say hi when hes out but not in his house it pisses him off. Kids think they are different than others and they can do it because they are somehow ‚Äúbetter‚Äù or ‚Äúmore chill‚Äù. Its not the case. Your home is your home and if you dont feel like you have any privacy it causes paranoia and anxiety. Its disgusting

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,eocqx2q,t1_eo9k82q,1558462479.0,"While i agree with that, unless you‚Äôve been in that situation you can never grasp how hard and deep this goes.
After reading this i see jenelles situation a lot differently. I have more empathy for her than i did before. (I‚Äôve never liked her and i still dont). 

I understand why shes stuck in this cycle of abuse with david. She has self confidence issues, abandonment issues and huge daddy/men issues. Now to know that before the cameras started this is how she was treated, not like we all didnt know babs was abusing in someway, but this hits a deeper level than i thought. Jenelle needs serious help.

This shit is ingrained in her and it seems like shes in denial about it."
