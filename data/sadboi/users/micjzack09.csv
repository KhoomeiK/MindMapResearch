The perfect response would be ""ok, lol"" and then promptly crossing out the c-word and replacing it with ""all political movements,"" just like what others did with Black Live Matter.  You know within yourself that that piece of paper is nonsense and you're the object of chuckle if you get outraged. We have far more important fights to fight."
ContraPoints,fejfn86,t1_fehpqgt,1579171913.0,"It's actually easier when you don't go to the extremes of an idea. Enumerate all of the things worth fighting for, find friends who support the broad idea and allow people to change. Once you nitpick every little thing, you're on a highway to extremism. Privileged youth in semi- to full- safe spaces often fall victim to extremism because they do not have the skills to temper their ideas."
ContraPoints,fcwtktb,t3_ej4nvi,1578037061.0,"Tbh, I was distraught about what the calling out culture has become. It's like taking an idea and perverting it to the highest heavens because you don't know how nuance works. And the community has really been subjected to fascist trolling but because of the lack of nuance, the woke crowd was just swept away and here we are."

I would go on an abyss vacation every now and then because of this. Recently, I've been thinking only about the things I need to do immediately. I do not know what day it is or how long it's been. I would just set reminders a week in advance in case I need to do something big. The skies have never been clearer. The clouds are still there but they don't bother me that much."
