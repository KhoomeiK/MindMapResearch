We started talking after our last class one day and it turned out we had a lot in common. He even tried to use a dungeons and dragons pick up line on me at one point. We finally started hanging out, but he kept telling me he wasn't interested in anything serious. He had plans to transfer out of state for his bachelor's degree. Eventually, we just agreed to casually date until he left. Turns out, he didn't transfer, instead he decided to join the army reserves.

Everyone seems to instantly grab onto mistakes he has made and blown them out of proportion. The man was by no means a saint, but it seems like people want to destroy him for doing stuff that's pretty commonplace for celebrities today. 

He hit his wife Cynthia Lennon. This is an unfortunate fact of his life. Abuse is abuse and it is horrific that it should happen to anyone by anyone. But no one talks about the steps he took in his life to end these behaviors (the guy went to therapy in order to get better). Yet because it's John Lennon, even though he did his best to grow as a person, he is instantly the worst human being on the planet and a hypocrite. Nobody bats an eye though when Kanye does some dumb shit, or Chris Brown beats and assaults MULTIPLE women.

He had a strained relationship with his son Julian, but not an abusive one. He was forced to keep both his marriage and child a secret because of their manager Brian Epstein. Later in life, when John was living in the United States their relationship got better. He and his son ended up getting very close until his assassination.

John was a man who had a troubled childhood. He was abandoned by his own father, and his mother gave up custody of him as a toddler to his aunt. His mom was then killed when he was 18. He was forced onto the world stage when fresh out of highschool. He was a dumb immature kid who did dumb immature things. He recognized his mistakes that he made while young and did what he thought could make it right. This is why he always preached peace and love.

The song isn't about communism or anything like that. He blatantly said so. It's just about putting your own bullshit aside for the betterment of humanity. See past your own religion/nationality/whatever else to be a better person to those around you. It's a message that whatever you believe, we are all just people. There is really nothing different about any one of us. We are all humans. It's okay to dislike a song, but to just use it as an excuse to shit on a guy who was trying to make the world a brighter place in his eyes and spread a message of peace makes me want to imagine a world where people aren't such dicks. 

In conclusion: 
Shitting on John Lennon doesn't make you cool
Shitting on the work of a man trying to make the world a better place REALLY doesn't make you cool."

explainlikeimfive,flcr3z6,t1_flcp9ma,1585042843.0,"Well, we really don't know a lot about depression. It can have so many different causes, symptoms, and other factors that play into it. Someone who got a depressive disorder after a traumatic event wouldn't necessarily be treated the same as a person who got it from genetics. 

Hypothyroidism is caused by an underactive thyroid and causes depressive symptoms, but can only be treated by treating someone with the hormones that aren't getting produced by the thyroid. 

Someone who experienced a traumatic event might go to therapy to help work through their pain, and maybe find some peace with it.

A person who was simply born with it can have millions of chemicals playing into it, and finding out exactly what combination is causing it can be nearly impossible. This is why you can't just take a dopamine booster or SSRI and expect it to be cured. They can boost mood and help symptoms, but they aren't getting rid of the underlying issue. 

Once these issues set in for long enough, the brain eventually starts to shrink. This mostly happens in the amygdala (emotional center), the hippocampus (memory center), and frontal lobe (personality center). The shrinking is permanent and can cause life long problems."
explainlikeimfive,flcqr6h,t3_fnz9hq,1585042389.0,"Hi, I am a person who has major depressive disorder (I have very intense depressive episodes), persistent depressive disorder (I  have had depressive episodes nearly constantly and have had them for about 2 years), season affective disorder (winter boosts my episodes, making them more intense), and panic disorder (I have intense anxiety episodes that usually end in a panic attack). This is my experience with it and how it effects me, but everyone is different. Mine comes from genetics and was passed down to me by my mother, and a traumatic experience (I would rather not talk about it). 

Sometimes the answer to your question is my brain is simply too focused on making me feel like shit. It's hard for me to remember to take a shower when I'm trying to convince myself why suicide is not a good idea. 

There are a lot of physical differences between someone with a normal functioning brain and a depressed one too. There are millions of chemicals that control what is going on at any given moment in the brain, so pinpointing the exact causes of any given mental illness is incredibly difficult. Psychiatrists have found that dopamine, serotonin, and cortisol most likely play a decent sized role in how depression effects the brain.

 The main parts of the brain you want to look at are the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the frontal lobe. The amygdala controls emotions, and tends to be overactive when shown negative stimuli, and underactive with positive ones in depressed brains. The hippocampus controls memory, and will actually shrink with people who have depression. The frontal lobe controls personality and even attention and some emotional responses. This shrinks too. This is what causes the problems you are wondering about. Once this shrinking has occured, there isn't a way to reverse it. 

Sometimes depression isn't even caused by the brain. Some people with hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid) experience symptoms identical with depression. Other underlying health issues can cause minor depressive disorders as well, so that makes it even harder to find the source of someone's depression.

Depressive disorders don't have a cure, only ways of relieving symptoms. For instance, I take escitalopram, an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). This doesn't cure my depression, but is a mood booster, making the symptoms a bit easier to handle. And these symptoms persist even outside of episodes. I lose things and misplace things constantly, I often feel very fatigued, and I have trouble focusing a lot of the time. 

I will have these illnesses for the rest of my life. I am lucky to have a very strong support group to help me through the tough times. All I want to do is spread awareness for a real illness that people often ignore."

My exroommate said this to me when I refused to lose my virginity to him. Then not long after our mutual friend also called me a selfish bitch for not doing it. They are both out of my lives now, thank God. (And I ended up losing my virginity to my *actual* best friend at the time)"

AskReddit,fl6h5j5,t3_fmk1ie,1584868653.0,"My mother has a surprising amount of these stories. 

She was a teacher at my elementary school. She started getting really sick towards the end of the year. She was having constant migraines and was throwing up about every 15 minutes for days. Eventually when she went to the doctor, they gave her a medication that was supposed to stop the migraines. Turns out she was allergic to it and went into shock. 

The next few months, all I remember (I was maybe 6 years old) was her constantly going in and out of the hospital, trying all of these different medications, and never getting any better. At one point, she couldn't even throw up. She couldn't use the bathroom, or even cry. Her body had just completely run out of fluids. My dad drove her to the nearest hospital (about 40 minutes away since we lived in the middle of nowhere). She was rushed to be given fluids. The doctors said she was maybe an hour or two from dying of dehydration. 

After her being in the hospital for a month, we finally figured out what was wrong. She has a severe mold allergy, and since the elementary was so old and usually flooded around the spring time, they had a huge outbreak. The whole building was shut down and cleaned. Luckily, they were already in the process of building a new school. The district payed for the medical bills since it was technically their fault for not cleaning the building properly. Even today, if my mom is around any types of mold she gets migraines.

Another time, back before I was even born, my mom was working as a volunteer firefighter. 

During a training exercise, they lit a barn on fire, had to put on full gear, then put the fire out. This was in the middle of Kansas in the middle of a record heat wave. It was about 105 degrees F outside, and they had to stand around in 50 lbs worth of gear from head to toe. For some reason, they were having trouble getting the fire started, so they had to stand in full gear for HOURS in direct sun. 

My mom said after about 3 hours, her vision suddenly went white and she collapsed. She ended up having a heat stroke. Instead of following protocol, one dumbass in the department tried to pour ice water over her. In turn, this sent her body into shock. Luckily, they had paramedics on standby who pushed him away and were able to actually help her. She said her first instinct was to try to punch the shit out of the guy once she came to.

Their crew also had a few assholes who liked to try and hog any spotlight they could. Their crew chief was known to make wrong calls and try to play ""town hero"". 

There was a house fire a few blocks from the station. All they knew on scene was that a little boy was trapped inside on the second floor. Instead of sending my mom and the other firefighter through the front door, where the fire was at its weakest, he wanted to make a spectacle out of it since the press were there (it was a tiny ass town, so it was just one guy from the local newspaper) and sent them through the side entrance. 

My mom tells me she only remembers hearing a loud crack and pushing the other man out of the way before the entire doorway collapsed on her. Because of her adrenaline, she kept going to try to save the little boy. They had gotten there too late though, and they couldn't bring him back. Today she has back pain and a screwed up knee from it. She didn't go to a hospital to get it fixed because she was busy grieving over the boy. He was only 4 years old, and the fire started when his father left a candle burning while he shot up heroin.

My mother is a god damn hero and far more badass than I could ever hope to be."
