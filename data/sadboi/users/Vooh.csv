AskReddit,fhrddm3,t3_f4gsxv,1581823429.0,"My buddy was messing with his roommate and decided to fill his roommates pretty good sized closet with balloons to the point where there wasnâ€™t an inch of room.  So of course I decided Iâ€™d be a good idea to sprint full speed and jump head first into the balloons.  There was a picture frame there to break my fall.  Probably needed stitches but I was a broke college kid so we crazy glued my wound together. 

Then there was that time when I came home from the gym and was making a protein smoothie.  I decided itâ€™d be a good idea to put some of a weed edible into my smoothie (like quite a lot 50mg or so).  So I drank my smoothie didnâ€™t feel anything yet so I went upstairs to take a shower.  Soon as I get into the shower the edible hits HARD... pretty shortly after I lose my balance and fall straight out of the shower and hit my face on the toilet. When I got to the ER they didnâ€™t believe I didnâ€™t have any head trauma because I was so high I could hardly function at all.  The good news was I was so stoned I didnâ€™t hardly feel anything not even the stitches getting put in.   

Iâ€™m really damn clumsy.   There was also a time I was at a bar really drunk and decided to sit next to an open fire pit.   Little bit later my buddy is screaming at me because I was on fire... luckily I just had minor burns nothing to serious."

I was able to talk him out of doing it.  He then proceeded to go back to her and put us on the side again.   Made me fall into a state of depression because I felt worthless.  Finally recently my dad got a divorce but I still couldnâ€™t shake the feeling.    I then got cheated on by my gf of 4 years a month and a half ago and it amplified the feeling.  I hit rock bottom literally but I found help and everyday has been a new day and things are starting to look up.    It still lingers and it might forever, but Iâ€™m learning to love myself again and reconnect with people I pushed away the last year."

I got cheated on by my gf.  I hit rock bottom.  I had to get help.   I started to see a therapist and get the appropriate help I needed.   About a month later I met this guy who turns out to be a major connect in an industry I always wanted to dive into.  We hit it off immediately and now two months later Iâ€™m as happy as Iâ€™ve ever been and working a job Iâ€™ve always wanted.   I know from experience life can kick your ass, but just keep pushing forward because thereâ€™s a light at the end of the tunnel even when I thought there never was."

Also after this week has a favorable schedule closing up the season.    Making the trade gives you 3 solid WR's especially with Shepherd being out potentially throughout the rest of the season.     I'd value them Sutton > Gallup > Kirk > Parker

As of September 1st we were finally able to move into a place together.  Iâ€™m thinking about trying to get her into the game.  She doesnâ€™t play video games but she has enjoyed playing Xbox with me quite a bit.   Weâ€™re the type of people who like to just hangout at home smoke and lounge.  Iâ€™m hoping it will be a good fit for her.  Wish me luck.
CompetitiveTFT,etk8k08,t3_cbtb96,1562891671.0,"Build comps based on the cards you get.  Never go into each game trying to force a specific comp if it isn't there.  Know what items build into what and what items can effectively shut down specific comps.   Try other items and see how the sync with one another.  Keep in mind this is an opportunity to learn and try different comps.  

&#x200B;

Try different items a lot of items are a lot more effective than people know.  

  
Use Spatula to help piece together comps.  Also try Hurricane (Spatula & MR Cloak)  

&#x200B;

Also in the early game don't always just throw units out there because your trying to build comps.  Use strong early game champions to win early matches then focus on piecing the comp together later on.  For example Khazix, Pyke, Kassadin are good champions early.   Also I like to upgrade early so I can get 4 units during the first match especially if I'm lacking items this way I can try to synergize a couple champions to build a winning comp early without strong items.    Don't be afraid to lose early though sometimes you just have to take early losses which is okay because it will give you more priority in the first carousel. 

&#x200B;

Also don't spam reroll over and over again especially early in the game.  

&#x200B;

Also try morello its op especially with aoe mages"
