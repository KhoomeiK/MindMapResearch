It does make sense. Thinking about taking away that ""burden"" feels productive and useful. It is a powerful feeling to feel like you are doing some thing to help other people (ie take away the ""burden"")"

I too have kids to think about. I tell myself that they will be okay eventually - everyone gets over things after enough time passes, no? 

It's great that you have a loving family.

good luck"
