Anxietyhelp,fghjfpr,t3_eycr2o,1580786180.0,"I wish i could say it gets easier with time but that wouldn't be true, at least not for me. I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for 30 years now. Ive had very happy times and very shitty times but guess what im still here fighting on. I see no reason to quit now. This is a mysterious disease we have, it tells us were less than others but i think maybe we have the upper hand. Only when you truly know how sad you can be can you know how happy you can be. All i can say is hang in there because this too shall pass"

Petioles,etbi6ns,t3_bx7uuc,1562647686.0,"I'm 53 years old. Smoked like a nut in my teens and early 20s then the hell started. Weed induced anxiety and depression. Got my legal weed card in pa and thought I would try it again.  Saw a nurse practitioner at the dispensary and really thought I'd be ok but soon as I took a hit, fucking anxiety again. Been going thru sum shit so I'm gonna take a break again."
