Documentaries,fdcso9z,t1_fdawb5v,1578283204.0,"Nice post. How do you define sane? For me it is more a question of keeping someone alive while you find the right treatment. That's the idea of hospitals.  The problem is that most of the time it's hard to say if it's terminal or not. But yeah, people not knowing shit about what it's like or that pretend to know that if you only did that or that it would be better are condensing so of hitches. (not to say that no one has good advice that can help). I think it's dangerous how much validity you give it. We saw how people in cult settings were willing to die just to follow their leader. The attitude towards these things as society really has an influence on the individual."
Documentaries,fdcino3,t1_fd9odpb,1578275849.0,Thanks for the kind words. I didn't say they should or shouldn't. I'm pro choice. I gave my example to show that it's possible and therefore should be considered in the debate when considering when to assist someone in dying.
Documentaries,fdchrex,t1_fd9lqya,1578275208.0,"I approve of his decision. Wholly.
I didn't say he should have continued to suffer because one day he may get better. I'm saying that it's a possibility and therefore makes it very hard to help someone kill themselves. 

I fully agree that in cases where a number of treatments didn't help, there is place for assisted dying."
Documentaries,fdcgo0e,t1_fd9ubo8,1578274437.0,"I'm sorry I didn't explain myself very well.
The problem with assisted suicide is that you approve to someone that their life won't get better and can't get better, because if it can I think it would make sense to endure it.

I do support euthanasia, people who suffer a lot and aren't willing to endure it shouldn't be forced to.

I don't judge anyone that decide to end their life but due to countless amount of people that got better even after many years of suffering, I am very polarized by the idea of helping someone kill themselves.

I don't claim Adam should have tried harder or anything like that. But I do believe his family approach and his commitment to die contributed and he wanted to prove a point to everyone.
That's the psychological element of suffering. People who suffer a lot have different ways of dealing with it and I do believe some ways can lead to better outcomes than others. Just because it's a possibility doesn't mean that in some cases they have to keep suffering to try and get there"
Documentaries,fdcfdqa,t1_fdbfcmm,1578273538.0,Exactly my point of view. Thank you for sharing and I'm glad you don't suffer as much as you used to.

Documentaries,fdbtupb,t1_fd9i8at,1578262023.0,"I did mention that I eas diagnosed with anxiety, depression, OCD, and somatic form disorder (I think also known as Fibromyalgia)..
It is extremely hard to accept some of these conditions, no doubt. And for some people much more so than others. I also can't say that I was him obviously because I don't really know what he was going through. But I was him in the way that for years I was suffering, and the suicidal thoughts didn't stop. Considering I had tried over 30 treatments and 22 electric shock treatments. I may have been able to get assisted suicide but ""luck"" wanted it and I remained alive,and continued to try long enough to be at a point where life is somewhat worth living.

That's why it's very tricky. Sometimes even when the condition itself doesn't get better, you learn how to manage around it better, DBT and Acceptance commitment therapy are some that deal with that.

So if you know that someone might get better and thier wish to die will go away do you fight to keep them alive?

Idk. I do think at some point they should get the means to do it. My exprience was that it wasn't easy to kill kyself. Save them the burden of living in worse condition after.
Where would be the line that says there is no hope?"
Documentaries,fd94wm1,t3_ek9djp,1578228460.0,"Ok I have to reply to this. I was Adam. I spent years of my life wanting to die. I planned how I was going to do it many times and attempted 3 over doses and two hangings. I spent two and and half years total in hospital in 7 different times for suicidal ideation. I took every medication out here and some every treatment out there except some non conventional ones. I was diagnosed by a doctor with somatic disorder (pain causes by the brain), depression, OCD, anxiety and social anxiety. I was a succeful highly driven kid before it all happened.I had been on a medication before that helped but had side effects and after being close to shooting myself in the head I admitted myself to the hospital and they added that medication again. The suicide thoughts reduced a lot, I still suffer a lot, I have a lot of cognitive problems, fatigue, depression and anxiety come and go. But with therapy and working out a lot and support, it's been better. I can live with this.
I tell you this because I although I believe Adam was suffering a lot, when he set up his mind that killing himself was the only way out and his parents supported that, it may have become his only way out. I totally get him and wish he had the right to die with more dignity, but with mental illness it is very very tricky to say when there is no chance things will get better. If the doctors and my family had given up on me I wouldn't have been here after all the attempts and suffering to share that life can get better. I don't judge him or anyone that end their lives suffering from mental illness but it is almost impossible for someone to make the call on that."
