This paranoia of being hurt made me such a reclusive person that it was awful for my social development, throughout high school I essentially spoke to no one, I just made a few close acquaintances, but never really hung out after school, it always felt like people just took pity of my reclusive nature. Only in the past 3 years I‚Äôve really been trying to get out of my shell, fight my insecurities, and trust people around me.

All the boxes on the left column in the information provided is the sum of the two columns on the right.

Therefore  making it a subtraction problem. 1=3-x. The answer is 2, but there are two ‚Äú2‚Äù answers. As said before, the right two columns dictate which numbers and function is being used.
