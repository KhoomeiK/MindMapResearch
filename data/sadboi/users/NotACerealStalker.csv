Granted it kind of loses the magic in my mind if you do it often. It's kind of like a birthday or new years thing for me.

mountandblade,fmh0iiw,t1_fmh0b70,1586062953.0,No clue dude. Sorry I can't be of any help. A random guess is that a mercenary is already working for them and maybe you can't have two working for one kingdom? It happened to me when I first tried to me a mercenary and I just decided to be a vassal instead. I'd honestly discourage being a mercenary right now as it's the exact same as vassalage currently.
mountandblade,fmgyrt1,t3_fv7vkp,1586061535.0,Just means they don't want you. Maybe they already have other mercenaries?

mountandblade,fmgh15g,t1_fm5l57v,1586048873.0,There is. Try executing someone haha. I've been releasing many many people and I haven't gotten honour but I have become merciful and generous.
mountandblade,fmge53t,t3_fv4i02,1586047005.0,That's kind of shitty. I'm not really raiding villages now since it's not as great. Caravans all the way now.
mountandblade,fmge0qv,t3_fv4jq3,1586046930.0,Some lords get pissed when you let them go. It's happened to me but I was on an execution spree so everyone was -100. It doesn't seem they should dislike you that much for releasing them.
Bannerlord,fmcuqtt,t1_fmcouou,1585953231.0,Yeah jesus christ. The no delay for winning the battle instead of waiting 10 seconds after everyone is dead like warband. I've probably saved countless minutes.
Bannerlord,fmcuk2i,t1_fmcnyz5,1585953128.0,I can get where you're coming from but it's kind of expected they'd be super similar. There's already a bunch of new things though with sieges and everything so I'm not disappointed. What do you think could have done different?
Bannerlord,fmcttlz,t1_fmc0k5n,1585952716.0,Start a new save or perhaps you have to end your contract first? I never had that problem but I also didn't take a contract.
Bannerlord,fmctpfu,t1_fmc3m45,1585952649.0,Yeah this isn't the problem.
