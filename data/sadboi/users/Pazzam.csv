TrueOffMyChest,fm79nea,t1_fm78b4j,1585818442.0,"Not all therapists are good a√±d this one sounds like dog shit.

Ive been with my partner now for 16 years and you could say we live in a 'heteronormative' lifestyle.. but really we are just who we are. He's a huge computer nerd who loves gaming and I'm into art, bush craft, gardening and more creative interests. We're not fashionable, we don't go out to clubs or cruise and we're not sex obsessed.

There are others out there like us and like you, there are being overshadowed by those who want to be the stereotype - and the reason why so many gay men live like a stereotype is because they spent so long obsessing over being gay that other aspects of their personalities haven't developed.. they are gay and that's their whole identity and purpose in life.

That's not enough for me and it sounds like it's not enough for you either. I think if you want to find guys like us, you can't go looking in gay clubs or on grinder. You need to join other groups and clubs that aren't about being gay, but instead let you pursue your interests. You'll make friends along the way and hopefully you'll meet someone like you.

I think you sound sweet and thoughtful, my kind of guy! But you also sound like you could be anxious and / or depressed.

I think you should try to find another therapist and definitely pursue your ""non gay"" interests.

All the best x"

The force is the water hitting and covering them.

Definitely battery.

todayilearned,ff8mdqj,t3_es5vd7,1579685707.0,"I often read Americans on Reddit defending their health care system with things like 'capitalism makes things cheaper and better!' but your healthcare is so prohibitively expensive that some people actually can't afford to go to hospital or get treatments when they need it, which I would imagine will lead to worse outcomes for more people.

Therefore your capitalist based heath care system is more expensive and doesn't deliver very good results.. compared with say the NHS

todayilearned,feg71dv,t3_eouba3,1579080015.0,"My family is having to deal with my narcissistic dad at the moment. After 42 years of abuse, my mum has finally left him with the ultimatum of 'get help or its over'.

The difficulty is that you cant force him into therapy as it won't work on someone who's there unwillingly.. and he really doesn't believe he's done anything wrong. He smashed things up, he spits at my mum, he's stopped her having a relationship with their children and grandchildren.. all of which he thinks is normal. 

I really don't know how this is going to pan out. He has a whole host of medical issues and has never had to take care of himself before. It's been two weeks since she left him and apparently he's been buying new clothes rather than wash anything because he doesn't know how to.. and despite all of the abuse over my childhood, I feel bad imagining him all alone in the house with no clue as to how he got there..

But, me and my siblings have our mum to ourselves and have spent more time with her over these last two weeks than we ever have and it's been great."
