1 can salmon(or leftover cooked salmon)
1/2 cup flour&1/2 cup cornmeal (or, use breadcrumbs/panko like this recipe. crushed saltines will work too)
1 or 2 eggs
1/2 onion finely diced
salt/pepper/old bay to season to taste


1)flake the fish apart. if using canned, gotta pick out the bones first
2)place all the ingredients into a bowl and mix well. 
3)form into patties
4) in a  skillet (we always used cast iron, but necessary) put oil to half way up the sides. we always used bacon grease or crisco, but any other oil works. heat to medium/medium high
5) cook in batches until both sides are golden brown
6)drain on paper towels

now, i never used mustard/mayo in mine, but, many do. so you can add a tbs or so of each to taste."
