However, I do think it’s been proven that eating a reasonable amount of calories (CICO) is the tried and true method for weight loss. Linking one article that compiles some sources on that: https://www.vox.com/2018/1/3/16845438/exercise-weight-loss-myth-burn-calories."

relationship_advice,fq3tet7,t3_ggqypw,1589070036.0,"Personally I would see this as a huge red flag— him giving you an ultimatum, that is. Here are a few things you should consider.
1. Do you WANT to move in with him? Just put the situation with your dad aside for a second and consider it, independent of all other factors: do you want to live with your boyfriend? Or are you using your controlling dad as an excuse not to? It’s totally OK if you don’t feel ready: what’s not okay is the lack of effective communication happening between you two regarding the matter. 

2. I don’t think it’s ever a good idea to move in with someone starting off on such a bad note. The whole experience, IMO, would be tainted because of it and because of the fact that you would essentially be moving in as a result of a serious argument. Not great. Plus, this has shown you how your boyfriend handles serious conflicts, and I personally would not want to live with someone who wasn’t more understanding of this situation."

Obviously there is a need for each person in a relationship to have their own hobbies, friends, and space.

So I’m a cap sun/aries moon/libra rising. Most of the time I identify more with air signs, and get along great with all three in social settings.

However, I do also tend to unconsciously seek out earth sign company. A lot of my really close, years-long friends are either Taurus or Virgo. Those relationships are always very easy, and I find time spent with those signs as less stressful/energizing and more relaxing than, say, air signs. I don’t know of any other female Capricorns, but I’ve hooked up with a few Capricorn men and they’re alright for the most part.

When I’m in a party mood, I can definitely appreciate fire signs— they get me hyped! But I don’t have a lot of those in my life as super close friends or anything.

I’m not the best artist but my drawings can be cutesy and I do have a couple of comic ideas so I think I’ll start with that. And I will definitely check out that offsite community! Thank you again!"

astrology,ffekdvp,t3_et5svr,1579851684.0,"as an aquarius mars AND venus, i'd also really like to know what's wrong with us

jokes aside, i feel like sex isn't really that important to me in a relationship. i honestly really like novelty, and once the honeymoon period is over i'm always okay with long stretches of no sex. i've been in two serious relationships, and this was an issue in both of them. and the more my partners addressed it, the more annoyed i became with them...and the less i wanted to have sex.

that's not to say that you shouldn't be communicating about stuff like that-- that's just relationships 101. maybe ask them what they're into, spice things up, idk. but in my experience, mismatched libidos can create a lot of resentment between couples."

astrologyreadings,ffd2e69,t3_esy4zm,1579812066.0,"Ohhhh boy 🙋🏻‍♀️ Capricorn sun, Aries moon here. I feel you on the earth/fire struggle. Throw my air rising into the mix and it’s a whole ass mess. Needless to say I haven’t reached a balance yet, and I’m definitely all ears. 

What has your experience with an earth sun/fire moon been? With my big three all being in different elements, I feel like I’m being pulled in three different directions at any given time.

With my sun and moon, the conflict is even more pronounced. My Cap sun is mature, responsible and unemotional. My Aries moon is childish, flaky and temperamental. It’s like I’m always having to parent myself 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️"
bipolar,ffd1usv,t3_esy60b,1579811762.0,"I share very selectively. I tell different snippets of information to different people. As a result no one has the full picture of what I’m going through, and that’s the way I like it. I would hate for other people to see me struggle."
