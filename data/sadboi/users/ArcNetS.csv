firstworldproblems,fou7wi4,t1_fou5qd1,1588078445.0,"Okay, so I get that that's how it can be interpreted, but in my mind it's a far stretch. I thought we can all agree that 6 days a week, sometimes 7, is quite a lot of work,  doesn't matter if you do it constantly or for some months, it's exhausting and it's not healthy.

""other people now have an opportunity to very temporarily enjoy a lifestyle that you will soon return to is absolutely not a first world problem"" - that's what I meant by assumption. That's not true. It's not like we switched sides. It's not that I will return to an chill laid-back lifestyle when this blows over and the other people will return to 40+ jobs and we will switch places. Only because I work ""only"" 3 days a week doesn't mean I get to chill a lot or that the other 4 days are a fun time. I have other responsibilities and also a life. I don't get to chill a lot, even with ""only"" 3 days of work. It's just that my life isn't dominated by work, but it's a part of it, among others. 
So I would LOVE it if I could just have some free time like others do right now. I also think I would deserve a 24/7 break from my 3 day week as others have them from their 40+ hours week. 

And to be honest, what really bugs me is that - and that's why I mentioned it in my headline - people complaining about boredom. That's an almost completely foreign concept to me. I don't have boredom, there's ALWAYS some thing to do and I would love to have that boredem they have right now to do all the projects I want to do. 

So, no, I didn't have a chill life before. There's this collective break the whole world seems to take and as thankful as I am for not losing my jobs, for having money and earning more and not being affected by the pandemic much, I would still love to relax for a bit, be part of this collective moment of pause, just maybe 2 or 3 days in a row. That'd be nice."
firstworldproblems,fou3fa4,t1_fou1qsz,1588075088.0,"1. The reason I replied to you is not that you disagreed - I mean that’s okay - it’s that you made an assumption about me which would be: If she worked a 3 day week before, she had so much time to chill, so it’s okay that she works more for a certain period of time, cause other people do that all the time because they have to, so she should be able to manage that as well. That’s where you lose me. Hardship and happiness of different people are not something that can be measured and compared to each other. It’s the same logic as not finishing my 20$ meal cause I didn’t like it  cause my neighbour who is a single mom and her kid are almost starving cause they have no money. 

2. But that’s where you’re also getting it, isn’t it? Others HAVE to work cause it’s a necessity for them, cause that’s how they and their families get by, but I’m the spoiled brat who doesn’t care about them and has an easy life working an easy job. 

3. No,my first world problem is that I have no time because I only sleep, eat and work all the time while others have these vast stretches of boredom at home I would love to have right now, cause I have millions of things I would need and want to do."

I didn’t complain that people who work a lot are lazy now. They deserve their time off. But just because some people have it so much harder than me doesn’t mean a situation can’t be hard, exhausting and mentally challenging for me as well. It’s not a competition. I won’t apologise for earning good money and living comfortably with a 3 day week. And I won’t apologise for having a hard time working so much just because there are people out there who have to slave away working 40+ their whole lives.

I like junk food from time to time. There's nothing wrong about it when your diet is alright the rest of the time.

And yes, we do need exercise. Not to look like models, but our bodies really need activity. 

I'm not okay with not keeping up with the news. Yes, it's awful and stresses me out often, but being ignorant isn't an option for me.

I love spending hours on videogames. I don't think that's wrong or bad. You just have to invest time in working on close relationships. If so many people long for them, it is possible to find people to connect with."

I always feel like journalists should at least have basic programming skills as we work with websites and social media so much. I really want to get into it as well, but I'm always postponing it and getting discouraged. I enjoy the work as a journalist and I don't know how to not lose the journalism thing and at the same time get into programming, cause I don't think I can do only one thing."
TooAfraidToAsk,f1n3zeb,t1_f1n1rol,1569608451.0,"Thanks or your insightful and long response. I understand what you're saying and get your point.
But I feel like the point you made is also a part of Greta and her activism. She is young and has learned that humans harmed the planet and we should do someting about it. So she, as a young human, turns to people in charge who are older, more experienced and demands to make those changes. I think she is well aware that changes mean it won't be pretty for her, her friends, her family, for the leaders and all of us. It will be hard and maybe even awful. 

But there's no other way, there has be done something, time is running up. It's not her task to come up with solutions (which were proposed by scientists anyway) or actually make the change, she's just asking on behalf of a lot a young and old people that someone who knows how to go about such a thing does it. I think that's fair and I think that's where her age is important as well. 

I don't think we're giving her words more weight, but as with most issues there is often one single person who speaks for a huge group of people and I think it's fine she's doing that for her generation. I wish there was someone like that in my generation. Maybe there was, but they didn't come through or they gave up or they weren't loud enough.

She doesn't have more authority on the subject. She stands for a whole generation of kids and teenagers who grew up in a world which might fall apart. They are scared of the future and for our planet. Instead of going to school, having fun, discovering music or whatever kids do, they always have this one thing in the back of their heads: what's the world going to look like when I'm old and have kids of my own? I think this is just sad. And I get that you demand changed and action aggressively from those who can do it - no matter how hard execution might be."

I also see that the American media is problematic, but even as a Non-American I know that there is plenty of right and left media and anything in between. But again: if the „agenda“ you’re talking about is that they want better air, less waste and CO2, less plastic etc, I’m fine with it.

So, you have to be old to make valid points on issues? Life experience doesn't equal to knowledge, understanding and wisdom in every human. There are dumb old and young people, there are smart young and old people. 

Also, what I always wondered about is how when I was a teenager (and I'm part of a generation that stands for nothing and didn't do anything but spend time on MySpace) people complained how every one is just into music or computers and ""those young people don't care about real issues and politics"", and now we have an outspoken generation who wants to take part in a global important discussion and everyone is like: Oh, go back to school and your smartphones, you dumb idiots, you know nothing. Well, they want to know obviously. Include them!"

I dug into this conspiracy theory cause I also thought: well, what if there's truth in it? I couldn't find anything which proves that there's money involved. So, here are my thoughts on the money thing:

If she's from a rich family, so why does she need even more money? Just greed? Well, you can make much more money in different fields, without being controversial and hated. Her parents are in the show business, why not get into singing or acting or writing some meaningless books or TV shows? That'll bring you money and fame and peace of mind, probably, if you're wired that way.

If she gets paid to push someones agenda - who is profiting from this? Some ""green lobby"" who wants to take over the world? The strongest economic forces with all the money in it are those harming our planet, she's definitely outspoken against those. Why go through all the hustle and the hate, if it's just about fame and money? And if some green lobby gains traction and companies with green/eco technology gain power - is that a bad thing? So our air becomes more breathable, our oceans contain less plastic, there are (maybe) less nature disasters. I don't see anything bad about this, but I see bad things about coal and cars running on gas. BUT: neither Greta nor I want to take those away from people, she just wants you to know that those thing cause negative consequences and maybe we need companies in this areas to react. 

Then there's the fame part. So her parents would push her with all their money for fame? As I said, wouldn't it be easier to gain fame with less controversial and ""easier"" stuff? Why would they want their daughter to be hated and attacked so much? All those grown up men wanting to rape her, kill her? It just doesn't make any sense to me. They have money (they are not that rich as some seem to think, they are not Leanardo DiCaprio famous) and connections - wouldn't every parent use those advantages to supoort their child? I would have loved to be vocal and passionate about something like climate protection like she is - but my parents barely had money, I wasn't so fortunate to pursue this kind of thing, I had to stick to ""normal people stuff"". So she does it, for people like me and people much less fortunate than you and me. Also: people seem to be okay with rich actors/musicians/Hollywood personalities being passionate about environmental issues - so where's the difference to a seemingly rich young girl?

Also, let's say it's the worst case: her parents pushed her (though I still do not think she's a ""puppet"" of some kind), there's profit and money, but in the end what she's advocating for is a good thing. It's a fact backed by science. We fucked up the world - maybe we're too insignificant to make it okay again, but why not do something about it anyway? Why not force companies and world leaders to act? We've been talking about this for decades and there hasn't been a change. All this started way before Greta was born. She grew up and saw what the world is like and she is pissed, disappointed and frustrated - I get her. I don't say she'll be the environmental savior, but she draws attention to a topic a lot of people are concerned about - and talks to the people in charge about it. I'm happy someone does that. 

To pick up your last point: if there's a radical statement like ""we should all be shamed, blabla"" I don't think every single human on earth should take that personally and feel offended. Of course, politicians and leaders and CEOs should feel targeted by this, but if you don't say something radical or controversial, no one will listen to you. So time is running out and there's no other way to react, cause like I mentioned in this thread before - asking people/leaders/CEOs to change and care more nicely won't do anything."
