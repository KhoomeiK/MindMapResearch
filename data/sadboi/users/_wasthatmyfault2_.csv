raisedbynarcissists,fn39vac,t1_fn364xa,1586616243.0,"Got it. She is probably projecting her bad traits onto you. But the bigger point here is that her behavior is highly toxic. Highly.

What she's doing is perpetuating a **smear campaign** against you. Smear campaigns are tactics that go hand-in-hand with the goldenchild/scapegoat dynamic. Maybe you know this, already? If not, you're in the right place here.

A smear campaign against her own daughter. Think about that. Do you think there is even a small chance that she has now, or will ever have, your best interests at heart? No. She's actively trying to destroy you.

I have been in a very similar situation, so I can speak to what has worked for me and what hasn't worked for me.

What hasn't worked for me is negativity of any kind directed to the parent or one of their flying monkeys. That shit will get used as more ammo against you so fast, digging you into a larger hole. So, I highly discourage this for your sake. Negativity as in anger, or sarcasm, anything they would consider 'weird or creepy', whatever it may be.

Going further, literally *speaking at all* to her or her flying monkeys has the high potential of being misinterpreted and/or manipulated against you, as more proof that you are a predator, creepy, sociopathic, all of that. They'll start talk-talk-talking about it, all of them. You could run into something like this when you genuinely express the need to have a heart to heart with your mom to fix the situation. ""Well thats not the you that I know, and again you're being sociopathic, trying to get something from me, you creep! You're scary!"".

It all sadly leads to going full no contact with her and her flying monkeys. You can't engage with this behavior at all. It's insane.

He should forget about his ex, not spend a single minute thinking about that anymore. Thats wasted energy. I think you said as much.

When OP says that she changed into a different person from the one that she was in the beginning: this wasn't his doing. This is normal behavior for her. It has nothing to do with him, codependency, whatever traits he has. We should be honest about this.

OP: definitely work on yourself, so you don't find yourself in another situation like this (it will have other benefits for you as well.) As far as your ex goes, don't try to make any sense of any of that. It wasn't your fault. It's not half your fault, nothing even close.

If you were to try to keep on good terms with her until this day comes, there is risk involved. There are no guarantees, and there could be surprises. The chance of something risky happening multiplies exponentially the longer you have to wait. 

The risks. After she passes, you are surprised to find that she didn't will the house to you like you thought. She willed it to your cousins, her best friend, gave it to charity, gave it to the church. Or, what if the home value takes a huge dip, and you would have been better off saving years for your own home instead. Or, what if she goes bat shit crazy and disowns you before she passes? It's not uncommon for narcs later in life. There are many more risks I'm sure, these are just the ones I've thought of while typing this out on mobile.

Here's the thing. When 2 people split, and they speak to mutual friends about it, the only (and best) answer is 'Im sad about where things ended up, I wish them the best'. A person that tries to turn convince others about how bad you are is a toxic individual. That's what toxic people do. Healthy people won't be convinced and will have a mind of their own. Any of your mutual friends that can't be open minded or think for themselves and decide to not speak with you any longer, they are not emotionally mature. So they can go do their own thing. Don't be hurt by them."
BPDlovedones,fm5t2s3,t3_ft8sbc,1585779399.0,Ok
BPDlovedones,flyrdiq,t3_frw3l4,1585607592.0,Congrats!!! Love hearing uplifting stories like this. Keep going.
BPD,flyds95,t1_flyd9ts,1585600269.0,You clarified nothing for me. You didn't respond to anything I said.
BPD,flyd2y3,t1_flycwyb,1585599898.0,"You responded to the wrong person, but I'm sure OP will see your response anyway :)"
BPD,flycfu8,t1_flx6aah,1585599554.0,"Hi! What OP described above are manipulative, abusive traits done by a toxic individual. She was caught having an emotional affair (at the least). He voices his concern about the situation and she responds angrily, threatening him with a smear campaign. Additionally, embedded within her threats are a lot of mean words, calling him a POS etcetera. That's probably projection, but only OP can confirm that.

So, cheating. Verbal abuse. Threats. Manipulation. A smear campaign. And, probably projection. 

I'm sure OP appreciates the video of 'what normally happens during breakups'. This video may be helpful for normal relationships. 

However, OP is not in a normal relationship. He is in a relationship with a toxic individual. She clearly exhibits many of the typical abusive traits of someone that has no comprehension or concern in addressing her BPD. (These types of people are the ones that give BPD it's negative image). She needs to work on herself clearly and come to terms with the pain that she causes others in her selfish pursuit of her own 'happy'."
raisedbynarcissists,flvp70t,t3_frgl4q,1585528856.0,"Calling them out on their bullshit will do nothing good for you. They'll never see it your way. You know that. They have no comprehension of your feelings. Also, narcs are known for smear campaigns and revenge. You don't want a smear campaign. Yes, your parents would do this to you. They may try to ruin you, ruin your career, take out credit in your name, make the rest of the family and everyone else hate you or be scared of you (cause they're innocent victims you know!).

I read somewhere awhile ago that you should write a simple letter and make sure that they absolutely receive it. Certified post it whatever, one that gets a signature. That's what I did."
raisedbynarcissists,flvofb3,t1_flvnwbg,1585528355.0,Best thing I ever did. Good luck! You're.going to be so much happier!
raisedbynarcissists,flvnnoi,t3_frfiqi,1585527866.0,"Leave them behind at your earliest convenience. If you cant leave yet, make a plan.

Thinking further about your mom, and your brother, is a waste of time. You can't figure out insanity, and that's what this is. Insanity. Leave and don't look back. You won't miss them."
BPDlovedones,flvn3c6,t3_frfolg,1585527496.0,"The happy, the normal, that's all an act. Underneath the mask is something that is so fucked up. And you saw underneath. Let him try to figure it out and fix himself, on his own. That's the best thing you can do for him."

BPDlovedones,flqoi43,t1_flqkoiu,1585401914.0,"Wow. That is insane. Really nice job though keeping track, then confronting her with facts when needed."
BPDlovedones,flpn7sx,t1_flpi4nf,1585363607.0,"Damn. That is also stuff that we all need to be aware of, not just location tracking. 

In our place, I had the desktop, she had the laptop. She would encourage me to use her laptop, which was a nice gesture, it seemed. I had my own account on it, but she was the admin. All of my passwords were saved by Chrome of course by default, so she had all of that until I realized that probably the point of her pushing me to use her laptop was so that she would gain access to all of my email, see my calendar events, see my location history, etc. All via Chrome and my Google login."
BPDlovedones,flpmpoa,t1_flpiu72,1585363244.0,"Oh, that sounds traumatic. 

My ex was saying creepy stuff about where I was, too."
BPDlovedones,flpln0t,t1_flpj1n6,1585362468.0,"I think my ex thought that everybody cheats, also."
BPDlovedones,flp6shz,t1_flp5zwq,1585352834.0,"At that point, her m.o. was all about trying to gain the upper hand, you know that she had an agenda all along and it had nothing to do with me. Like ""I always do what I want, you were just my pawn all along you sucker. You dumped me but actually you're the loser and got played"" type shit. A few very illustrious examples that I won't share here, I don't have the time to think about that b.s. anymore.

The big picture is she doesn't have control of herself, tried to change, couldn't, then played like she had a big plan all along. Yeah right."
BPDlovedones,flp5pgo,t1_flp2gew,1585352199.0,"Yeah, thats super messed up. I was accused of cheating also, of course she was the only one doing that."
BPDlovedones,flp5ezm,t1_flp3y5b,1585352025.0,"Yes, I did already, and I installed an alarm system."
BPDlovedones,flp55i4,t3_fq5kss,1585351872.0,"I left. In addition to the lying, the cheating, me being her psychologist and life coach with literally nothing in return, she started splitting on me hard. Told me to GTFO. Second time this happened, I told myself one more time. It happened again, so I made my plan to GTFO like she had asked. I couldn't just leave, I had to plan out what was next for me, so months of acting. I finally left and she was devastated. Honestly I was devastated, too. It sucked. After a few weeks of trying to get me back she decided she had to gain some control back and be ruthlessly evil. That was horrible.

Her condition owns her. I have pity for her. After things calmed down, we spoke on the phone. I think a very feeble attempt to hoover me at that point, but I didn't go for it. I'm better without her. It's all so fucked. It's still hard, but I'm keeping busy. I miss her. I miss her? Do I really? Did I ever really know her. It's impossible to know. I was conned to make her feel better about herself. It's all so tragic."
BPDlovedones,flp3gd3,t1_flp1fk7,1585350889.0,"LOL, some other dude can have that, for real. 

I broke up with her, and wondered if she was somehow tracking me afterwards, like she had her ex-husband. She had ways into my home, quite a lot of ASPD traits, owned multiple guns, and had no empathy for anyone."
BPDlovedones,flosgvy,t1_floqcno,1585344557.0,That's good. I find it creepy af.
BPDlovedones,floal5d,t3_fq26ir,1585334653.0,"Hard NC is your only option. The only one. Your sanity won't be fucked with anymore. I know it sounds impossible, but in short order you'll thank yourself. There was nothing magical ever there with her. It was all an act. Show her that you could give a fuck about her anymore. Don't speak with her again."
BPDlovedones,floa4gq,t1_flm2s3r,1585334410.0,"Same. Sounds like a bit of projecting there, too. I was the hot and cold one (hmm), I was a liar (uh-huh prove it), I would encourage/push her along towards what she wanted to accomplish, that rarely worked out well."
BPDlovedones,flo9lco,t1_flm2rt2,1585334130.0,"""I know you better than you know yourself"". 

I thought this so, so often."
raisedbynarcissists,flk48i5,t3_fp6mes,1585233589.0,"You're still young. Don't dwell on what could have been. You have time to do a lot of great things for yourself, things you'd wished you'd been taught or shown or given before. And I guarantee that you will fight for things more than someone that was just given them no questions asked. 

I relate for sure to your feelings. Why did my parents never ever encourage me to pursue the things that I was naturally talented at? Why didn't they encourage me about literally anything? Why didn't they ever ask me why I was sad or upset? Now I don't know how to process my own emotions or help others through theirs. Why was I literally their enemy at times? Why was my sibling their favorite? He was encouraged, he was given things he needed. I could go on forever."
BPDlovedones,flk0n4j,t3_fp7jv4,1585231349.0,"If she cared about your concern, your feelings, and her relationship with you, her response should be the opposite of ""your point is invalid"". Doesn't matter if she was like that before. 

Seems like she could give a fuck about all of that. Which narrows down your range of options with her big time."
BPD,fljbqo6,t3_fp6m7r,1585205889.0,"You've already done most everything you can do, and you've been smart and reasonable. Seems like he needs to work on himself if he cares enough to keep you around. 

You can set a boundary in regards to his honesty issue. Give him another chance. Otherwise I think he needs some time to work on himself."
BPD,flivxow,t3_fp027b,1585192041.0,"Things are probably  hard for everybody, despite what it usually looks like to you, or on social media, anywhere. Looks like to me you know what you can work on. That's half the battle. Don't worry."
