BPD,for1urg,t3_g9367y,1588004732.0,"BPD or no BPD, the majority of the time you will not get a feeling of closure when relationships end. Closure is something you give yourself. Another persons actions or lack of action is not gonna give you that. Understanding a situation more will not give you that. Wallowing in pity will not give you that. 

She clearly wasnt ready for a relationship and/or just didnt want a relationship with you. No further explanation or acknowledgement or apology is needed. 

Looking for 'closure' is just an excuse to keep clinging on. You need to look at yourself and why you are doing that to yourself. This is nothing to do with your ex. 

Move on, and stop choosing to torture yourself with looking her up on social media or wherever you're watching her on now. Accept what's happened and move on. It doesnt matter how she feels or what she's done to you. 

It is a choice to focus on what is causing you misery. You are out of what sounded like a pretty dismal relationship. Be grateful, and focus on what you want more of in your life because that is what expands. If you want to stay miserable by continuing to focus on this relationship then that's also fine, but nothing will change for you by doing this to yourself. At best, you will get another toxic relationship with someone who doesnt value you. Why do you want that for yourself? 

Also, first relationships are significant and the endings can be devastating - I know that. But a few years on, I barely ever think about my first ex now, except feeling mild embarrassment knowing what I put up with. 

You can get past this but no one else has any effect on that, it's entirely your choice. Try showing yourself love instead of pining after whatever bs she added to your life, and look at what you need to work on in yourself to be able to be in healthy relationships. 

Sending hugs, break ups are rough whatever happens, but they are an important part of how we grow as people. Look at the lessons this relationship has taught you, and what you will or wont put up with in future. BPD or no BPD, you can do better than your ex if you put the work into yourself xx

leaves,fiy4dm1,t3_fagpdv,1582832276.0,"I'm not really commenting on the title question, but just a couple parts.. That he has gone to counselling is great but counselling/therapy is an ongoing, longer term thing - by the second session you and the therapist are just getting to know each other. He needs to make a commitment to himself to continue with a counselor, even if it's just to moderate his usage or explore the underlying issues. 

If he is depressed then it is extremely difficult to put in the effort to do anything, let alone fix a whole marriage. That's an extremely daunting sounding task. If his focus can move to helping himself with his issues instead of weed/the relationship, there's a decent chance that that could then actually help the relationship/excessive weed. If he is going through a serious depression, then there's a good chance he simply doesn't have the strength to put in the effort you want him to show, and he needs to focus on healing himself first. 

Weed can be used as a coping mechanism which then just exacerbates the issues, but theres been certain points in my life where the only other coping mechanisms I could think of were much worse than weed. Even though I knew it was bad for me I couldn't see any other options and I genuinely didn't know how to cope without it, so I just continued despite all the negative effects i could see in my life. I just couldnt see how to get back to life without it. The issue was in myself though, and it takes time to work through things. 

Reframing why hes getting counselling so it's not quitting weed or saving your marriage might help make it seem less daunting to him.

The only other thing I could suggest you do is just completely remove yourself from the situations where his behaviour is causing you difficulties, and to not act as his stand in therapist. Just say you're not a trained professional or it affects your mental health so you're not dealing with x/y/z anymore. Walk out if you need to. 

You already know that shouldering the entire weight of a relationship isn't sustainable, so take it off yourself and let him do some heavy lifting as well. Detach and focus on yourself, it might make him want to follow suit. 

Also - 

>1. What if he doesn't want to go to therapy? That'll mean he doesn't love me enough to try to be better for us. (I already know he doesn't love himself, so that's out of the question.)

If that happens, just please know that it isn't about him loving you. He might love you deeply, but if he cant show himself enough care to get help that means hes gonna possibly end up missing out on someone who sounds quite smart and loyal and considerate. That's his loss. There'll be someone else for you who can show you the love and consideration that you need whereas he'll be stuck in the same place.

>2. What if he goes to therapy and it turns out that I'm the one causing his illnesses and he leaves? / Irrationality again.

Then you go work that out in therapy so you can try to avoid the same behaviour in future. That means the relationship wouldnt be a loss as well as you would have learnt and gained knowledge that allows you to keep on progressing and doing better in life/relationships.

If you write out situations that have happened or happen often step by step, you can then write it out again with what you would do different in an ideal world, and then slowly work towards actually doing that. Theres worksheets specifically looking at relationships as well that might help.

You could also show him this post so he knows how you feel about it, and maybe ask him to sometimes (gently!) call you out on it when you're doing those things that you dont wanna do, or if he knows you're at a party for example, he could engage less with you (eg.

If shes just gonna keep pushing you until you crack or if shes toxic outside of things like this then I wouldn't suggest just accepting it. But if there is a relationship underneath all this that's worth saving, then maybe seeing what happens if you accept/ignore these things for a while, accept that theres gonna be things that get under your skin, and that you wont be able to change her. Maybe find some kind of in the moment coping mechanism or distraction technique (look up dbt skills workbooks in the sub - theres worksheets available free). 

Dont indulge her need for attention and she might get bored/look at her own behaviour and when shes not getting reactions from you anymore. Maybe she'll grow up, and maybe she'll follow your lead and start acting a lot more pleasant so the relationship can improve.

If/when she asks why you're distancing yourself, explain that you have no desire or need to continue to subject yourself to ""jokes"", manipulation, having money/her issues used against you, or being used for whatever benefit she gets from treating you this way. 

She needs to work on herself and her behaviour before you can have the loving mother-child relationship that I'm assuming you both want. Hopefully that would give her the kick up the ass to sort herself the f out.

Go to college. Get those applications in and start planning your move once you get accepted. That's an awesome adventure to have ahead of you :) keep that ambition going :) 

If he doesnt want to have a reasonable discussion then fuck it. He can either get over it or work with you to find a way to make it work - it's not up to you to get him on board, you dont need to make him have a convo about it. 

As long as he knows your plans and sees the progress you're making with those then he'll be aware, that's enough for him to act. If he doesnt then he doesnt, f him.. do you know how many amazing guys exist in the world who would give you love and care and affection? Know and believe that's what you're worth and it will come in time. 

The relationship might not have always been this way but you're not living in the past. Do you want your future to stay the same as the present with him as he is currently? Would you want to be in this relationship in 30 years time when you could have gone to college and opened yourself up to totally new experiences and people? 

(ETA - if he sees you're serious, and sees you knowing your worth, there's a good chance he will too. Not necessarily saying break up here at all, that's tough after a long time but just look at how you're valuing yourself compared to how you value him)"
Entrepreneur,fekeybn,t1_fei9ze9,1579198633.0,"Maybe ignore what I said on the 5 meals thing actually :) if others are doing it then there must be value in it, plus I could totally see people buying 5 of the same for a dinner party (that would be super useful..) or something along those lines. 

Flyers/printing I've had the best luck looking locally so I can spend time in the shop discussing options and deciding what's best. I did a design degree tho so I'm probs a bit geeky with choosing paper and those kinda things :D probs not the cheapest options though so maybe have a search of the sub to see if theres any uk recommendations.

Def a lot to wrap your head around but yeah, just start as basic as you can and then build up. Sometimes it takes doing the thing to see how it would work best :)"
Entrepreneur,fei6aib,t3_ep9n0k,1579131230.0,"Yes, go for it. It's a good idea. 

As you say start small, if you're feeling a little overwhelmed or the website is taking too long, maybe use that time to just start off word of mouth for a few weeks. Create a basic website on squarespace or wherever with good photos, descriptions of the meals, and an explanation of the pricing (that confused me slightly - maybe just charge the higher fee for whatever combo they want? Or tier it? I'm not sure how many would want the same meal 5x a week unless I totally misread that..). Ask friends to let others know and put flyers in vegan cafes.

Use that time to get your processes in place, get used to the new routine and then after a few weeks or a couple months once your website is designed, start with online orders and open it up on a larger scale. 

You sound like you know what you're doing already, or at least that you're at the stage where you are going to learn by just going for it now. 

If you pm me once you've got a website I'll ask my brother down in Bristol to share it around :) have fun!"
BPD,feglmzr,t3_eozqa5,1579096568.0,"Not overreacting at all, just stop, say you cant do it and see how he responds to that going forwards. 

If people see a way to take advantage then they often will just because they can, and they get used to that quite quickly.

Different situation but those lines really reminded me of when I started smoking cigarettes again. I cut that person out of my life pretty soon after, once I stopped beating myself up for restarting. 

That was my fault/choice 100% but some people do (subconsciously or not..) try to bring others down and it's just easier/nicer to not associate with those kinds of people, whoever they are and however subtle what they're doing is. 

How serious are you about her, and is she worth the risk that you wont stay clean? Separate topic but the  way you speak about her compared to your ex is very different. 

Maybe just see how she acts and what she says to you going forwards if you want a less drastic suggestion but you dont seem particularly confident (or excited) about the situation or the girl.


ETA - you wont ever find a relationship that felt as good as the one you were in if you're spending your time with someone just to not be alone. You were with someone good for you before, you can be with someone good for you again. 

You have to know that your ex didnt make you a better person. You did that, so you can do it again. You dont lose yourself once a person leaves your life, you just feel and tell yourself you have so your life begins to reflect that. It's up to you to change that.

BPD,fd5ixv6,t1_fd4yrqk,1578178092.0,"Ah sorry I read it wrong. I think you're right to respect her distance but I think you need to shift the focus to yourself. You've talked a lot about her but not much about caring for yourself or being kind to yourself. It's a big loss, you dont need to beat yourself up on top of that. 

I saw somewhere the other day that limbo is a permanent state of loss and you kinda seem like you're keeping yourself kinda in limbo right now. You have to take yourself out of the limbo somehow so you can grieve the loss and move on. 

If you're nervous about hurting her if shes been through rough times, maybe send a short message saying you feel like shes distancing herself and you want to respect that, but that youd be there for her if she ever wanted to talk, or if anything was the matter. Dont expect a response. 

It might sound bad but I know i distanced/cut myself off from most of the people I was around most when I was going through bad times. Not always deliberately but.. I guess they felt associated with those times. 

Those people do still matter to me, they are still important parts of my life and I think about them, sometimes miss them, but theyre past life now - the idea of being back with them makes me feel back in old times again and it's hard to be around them cos I dont wanna be a dick to them, I dont hate them.. it's just difficult for me to connect or open up to them at all. 

Missing someone just straight up sucks and there isn't really an answer apart from time and distractions. I would search the sub for dbt workbooks though. There are useful techniques in those that might help you. 

You matter enough for you to focus on you right now, detach from her if shes detaching from you, even if you're the older one and shes gone through some shit, youre going through some shit dude. That energy you gave to her, to look after her - give it to yourself. You need that love too. You deserve to look after yourself and make yourself the most important person, cos that's what you are, really. 

You might have fucked up but we all do, all the time, and it doesnt mean it's a mistake that shes not really in your life right now. And bpd or no bpd, if the communication and connection ain't there, then theres no relationship there anymore. Youre directing energy at a black hole but you dont need stay being sucked into it.

BPD,fd4o14l,t1_fd4dc0c,1578169344.0,"Seconding this one, I think it's worth taking the gamble and starting a conversation with her OP. 

A lot of assumptions being made, and yknow.. maybe the ship has already sailed but have a think about reaching out to her and opening up a bit about what's been happening on your end. 

If she does want distance then that's cool, but at least youd get closure and clarification on what was happening between you both. If that wasnt what she wanted then yknow.. you can see what you guys wanna do about it."
BPD,fd3zvct,t3_ejz0ct,1578163085.0,"You don't need to love the new guy if you ain't into it (dont need the old guy either but that a bit deeper..). 

Take your time with the new guy and if you're not feeling it then that's fine, you dont need to like him just cos hes there, or cos hes nice. If you end up liking him then that's fine too. 

It can take a lot of time to adjust and to start to accept the idea you can be loved and that you deserve to be loved when you're used to guys who arent nice. The shit situation is more comfortable and familiar but that doesnt mean it's where you need to keep yourself. 

You're enough without either of them though. 

Try calming or soothing yourself a bit, distract yourself for a little while and then come back to it, and write out the pros and cons for staying in either situation and leaving either situation. Maybe keep coming back and adding things for a while. You dont need to make any decisions on anything right now. Give yourself some space from it if you can."

BPD,fbh94n9,t3_edcvi2,1576868157.0,"You're not worthless, or unloveable. I dont know you but I love you. 

I feel the same ways too a lot but it's not true, really. I just reinforce that belief by repeating it or avoiding situations where I'm scared I'll be rejected in some way, like not getting out and trying to meet new/better people. 

If I dont go to something I think I might enjoy it's because I dont feel I'm worthy enough, but if I go in with the hope that I like whoever I'm meeting or the people in a group I want to try, it shifts the perspective, it detracts from hoping they like you. You're hoping you like them, cos that matters too (or matters more even..).

In reality, and not just my own head, if I try to push past those fears and put myself out there even just the tiniest bit, it's very different to what I'm fearing. We are likeable and loveable people. We dont need to believe that but just.. open up to it, even the tiniest amount. It's a struggle but I'm trying to learn that/act on that, slowly but yknow.. 

It sounds childish but I genuinely hope you block him everywhere and delete his number before he unblocks you. You can do a lot better and he will be playing a huge role in why you feel unable to get out of this misery you're in right now. Losing anyone, even toxic people, is painful but I promise you that any intense pain will subside. You would at some point suddenly realise you're feeling better alone than you did with him in your life. 

He might be generous and kind to others but from what I'm reading, hes a gross fucking asshole and no part of him deserves the energy and emotion you're dedicating to him right now. That ""bye loser"" should not have been a joke, you should have been completely serious with that and I hope he stays out of your life for good. I know how painful that would be but he doesnt deserve your love and you deserve so much fucking more than a brat who acts like he does. He knows how to play with your emotions and fuck with you to keep you stuck. I feel like hes controlling you with this shit. 

Also, I dont want to make it sound trivial, I know this is a super painful situation, but I've got stretch marks all over my body, loose skin from my weight yo-yoing so crazily so I sag all over, big jiggly belly, zits, varicose veins in my 20s.. it ain't cute. But if a guy likes me, he's still gonna wanna fuck me, I haven't had any experience tell me otherwise once it gets to that stage so please dont feel you have to hold on to that fear (I know it's hard to let it go completely or not be nervous but everyone you'll ever be with has their major insecurities, even if that thing is barely noticeable to you).

Any guy who saw you naked and ran away would be a pretty whatever kinda dude. Anyone worth keeping wouldnt give a shit about some stretch marks and spots or scars. At the same time, just because someone will sleep with you or not be turned off by certain things, it doesnt mean they're worth keeping around either. 

And just personally, eyebrow scars are sexy af. Even really wierd looking ones.. I dunno what it is but I'm guessing theres gonna be other people who feel the same way I do about it. I really hope you can feel that way too one day.

If you check the etsy subreddits and search for free shipping, you'll see that it hasn't been worth it for a lot of sellers. Etsy said items with free shipping would rank higher in searches but it doesnt seem that this is actually the case a lot of the time so definitley a good chance the free shipping isn't worth it. Itd be up to you if you decide to go for it or not. 

Ignoring all that though, its generally a decent idea to build some of the shipping costs into the product price so you can offer cheaper shipping, as high shipping fees can put some customers off and candles are heavier items (doesnt matter if the total cost would still be the same)."

Dont put yourself back at square one. Or him either - he sounds like he needs to build a life up, find friends, a stable job. Whenever I'm trying to let go of someone I feel I still love, the only way I can frame it for myself, is letting them go so they can be happier/be more. Having someone like you who gives him what he needs short term keeps him stuck. 

Its upsetting but it's worth it, eventually. 

You also deserve a lot more. I know how tough it is to say something like that to someone and how fucking shitty it feels, how fucking bleak. I'm still struggling at times, months later but its lessened, and I know that it was for the best for me that he left. That was genuinely the best possible thing that could have happened for me to start getting better and seeing a way out my own shit, let alone just the ending of that relationship. Ive understood a lot about myself from trying to understand the relationship. 

I still feel fucking horrendous sometimes, I have a lot of ups and downs tbh but overall, things are getting better pretty steadily. 

I know if you had the awareness and strength to call him on his shit and take yourself out the situation, then you're strong and aware enough of yourself to get out the other end of this. It might suck like hell for a while but you will.  

Maybe start trying to pay attention what you need to feel better or taken care of, or what your inner child needs (imagine you as a little kid, do you need to give yourself a hug? A movie? Your favourite meal?). Give little you the love and care they need if you feel you cant give it to yourself.

ETA - please dont wait for him to call you back to talk about it. I know that might be an impossible ask but I know how many days and nights (months) I wasted completely fucking devastated waiting for a text, a call, anything.

Go to therapy/a dbt group if you're not already. Find a place to go/something to do without him that you like to do (find another one if you get bored in a few weeks..). Breaking up will feel a little less scary if you've got some support and places to go, a bit of a routine. 

I did this in the past in a super dependent relationship, breaking up wasnt the aim of it but whenever I think about that time and all the good shit that started happening, the breakup happened as a consequence of me starting to do/feel good and it was great for me - a bit of drama before the end but.. I think he didnt like that I didnt need him anymore, and that was clear enough to me as well that it just took a pretty small fight for it all to be done with. Theres still getting over the break up and getting used to being alone, but it didnt take long for me see that I was better off without him even if i did still have moments. 

I'm sure theres healthier ways to do it than I did btw! Minus the drama would have been nice but **shrug** Second paragraph really isn't advice just.. build yourself back up so you can feel stronger in yourself.

BPD,f8lg5nr,t3_e12gy9,1574621932.0,"There was a post on here a day or two ago by a woman who had just got pregnant, it was a really nice post to read, she was in a good place. Maybe worth searching for it if you can (I think I commented congrats maybe?) 

I totally get your fears, I have them too at times, but I think it depends on how much work you put into yourself, and learning to be a good parent to yourself as well maybe. 

Not saying it wouldnt be a struggle for some (maybe most of us? Idk..) but I dont think you need to give up on having a family unless you're giving up on yourself (and dont do that :D please)"
BPD,f8fw5q1,t1_f86vz0o,1574550249.0,"You havent ruined it for yourself, he did something to you that you didnt want, that wasnt your fault. I understand if reporting it feels too much but please look into speaking to a therapist or counsellor about  it, take care of yourself right now - imagine how you would look after a younger version of you and apply that to yourself. Sending you love and hugs, and I'm really sorry this happened to you xx"
BPD,f8fpu7e,t3_dztnsc,1574547732.0,"Congratulations! That's awesome :) I'm really happy you're in a good place as well, super nice to read this :)"
BPD,f8figa0,t3_e0kptx,1574544173.0,"Yeah, feeling kinda similar :) I'm trying to be more consistent with things I know I enjoy and are good for me. Its been kinda hit n miss so far (this last week was kinda rough) but still in a better place than I have been. Going to a new place for meditation tomorrow to see how I like it. Hopefully I can make it a more regular thing again because I do miss it.

Its super dorky but I've been making candles as well and I'm obsessed but not.. so completely obsessed that ive spontaneously combusted within a few days :D it's the first thing I've been consistent with for longer that that in god knows how long tbh, and I think its helped me having something I enjoy, it's chilled out, and it doesnt rely on other people or going out when I havent been up to it. Having an endless supply of candles is a plus as well :D 

What kind of IT are you into?"
