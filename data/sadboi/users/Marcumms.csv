electricdaisycarnival,eotj7th,t3_bsmr6k,1558842151.0,"I stayed in the town right over, Henderson. Stayed at the Green Valley resort. It was like $120 a night but it was so nice. The whole plaza had everything we needed so we didn’t need to drive much. 

I noticed significantly less traffic leaving from that hotel. I usually can’t wait to leave Vegas because I hate the strip. But this year I didn’t wanna leave. 

40-50 minute drive to the speedway if you time it right."

Once you become more experienced you can almost feel a difficult trip is on the horizon. But I mean, what’re you gonna do? Stop taking the drug because you’re scared? 

It’s kind of taught me to embrace being uncomfortable. Because you feel so much better once you get through it. 

But 400 ug for your first time? Idk who you were around but I wouldn’t have let you do that. Those are break your brain levels for a first timer. I would’ve had some Xanax or klonopin on hand just in case you started to spiral."

electricdaisycarnival,eoo7ohy,t3_bshzao,1558731534.0,"Make vitamins a daily routine. You don’t eat while you’re rolling, so you should’ve been getting a lemonade every hour or so each night at EDC. 

Melatonin and zzzquil to knock you out once you’re heading to bed to make sure you get sleep. Vitamins again. Gatorade! Not just water. You can hurt yourself by draining your electrolytes and only drinking water. 

No 5-htp during the event. Start taking it 2 days after your last roll. Don’t roll more than 2 days in a row and set a limit for how much you’ll allow yourself to take. Don’t drop before 10 pm. 

Force yourself to eat if you have to. You’ve gotten through the hard part. The rest is just EDC withdrawals I think, not a mdma comedown."

Just be careful."
electricdaisycarnival,eoo6drc,t3_bslrbw,1558730537.0,"My fiancé drank the last because she was starting to show symptoms of serotonin syndrome (I begged her to not roll at all, or at least only one day, but she did 2 in a row).

She said the night she drank was the most fun she’d ever had at EDC. But she did have a hangover that lasted 2 days. 

I prefer to trip and then go sober. But I also realized this year how easy it is to slip into a difficult trip. So it’s all about what works for you. I’d say it’s worth a shot, especially if you only plan on rolling at festivals."
electricdaisycarnival,eojvilf,t1_eojurn8,1558643471.0,"I’d say it because of who I was with. Their energy was always so negative or we just didn’t mesh.

electricdaisycarnival,eojp7nn,t3_bs6f18,1558640945.0,"For the past 3-4 years it’s been more like “Fuck, we’re at EDC again.”

I’ve gone 5 years in a row. We did things a bit different this year. We stayed in Henderson (the town over from Vegas) which meant I didn’t have to deal with the strip. 

I only went with my fiancé and didn’t have to deal with any of the negative energy I normally would have. We just had a blast, especially on day 3. I had my “WOW, I’m at EDC” moment at Circuit Grounds during Cash Cash. 

I normally don’t leave Kinetic Field, but this year I wore comfy shoes instead of vans or converse so I was more than ok to just walk around. For 4 years I mainly stayed at Kinetic, but this year I realized how wrong I’ve been. 

I thought this year would be my last. But all it showed me is that I still have a lot more to do and experience. Here’s to 2020!!!"

I won’t give you what you want. I won’t call you a monster, because you’re not. You’re definitely sick, but I can’t help you with that. Just, please... never own a pet again. Even in kill shelters they show them more mercy than you did.

I write, shoot, and edit extremely low budget movies. So I get the feeling of being stuck. Being too scared to start because it won’t be perfect as first. It’s ok if things aren’t perfect at the start. Looking on IG for inspiration is hard because IG was made so you could edit your life to look perfect. 

I’d suggest to just sit down without a plan and start something. Even if it’s something new every day. Just make it a habit to work every day. 

As for exercise, you don’t need a gym. You could do yoga right in your room. Do that for a while and once you’re comfortable that you want to move on, go get that membership and keep it short. Or ask to speak to someone else. 

You don’t suck. You can’t suck if you don’t try. Then once you start, it might not be the best, but that’s normal. You can only get better if you try."

You’re so young, and I’m not saying your experiences haven’t been tragic, but you’d be surprised what moving on in spite of them can do. Use it at fuel instead of a crutch. 

But you have to start today. Baby steps. Do anything. Take a shower. Clean your room. Write a to do list. Reach out to anyone. Just don’t give up."

BPD,eoeb7dt,t1_eobhbhc,1558492274.0,"You call it black and white thinking, my fiancé coined the term (not officially, but it made so much more sense that now I use it) “The Spiral.”

I get into these moods where when one thing goes wrong I start offering ultimatums in other parts of my life. Let me tell you something, whether you’re spiritual or not, doing is the demon in the ear of every person in the world that’s trying to get you to sabotage yourself.

Are you the type of person that like to be right? When things are too good, I go out of my way to ruin it. My doc called it the self fulfilling prophecy. I thought it sounded cool, so now I pay more attention to when I might be trying to start a spiral. 

Thank you for your kind words. I’m just wishing I could help more and give you a hug to tell you you’re gonna be more than fun you’re gonna kill it. Just don’t stop trying. Figure more and more of yourself out, slowly. Learn something from each failure because it is not fatal. You’ll love, and whatever doesn’t kill you makes you blah blah.

Maybe one day if we keep in touch I can tell you the whole story, but I think this is good for now. But you’ve gotta remember, this is your trip towards inner peace. My path might be different from yours, but as long as it give you inner hope then I did my job. 

You’re worth love and you deserve to be patience and gentle with yourself. Try that for a bit and you might see some changes sooner depending on how hard you follow your plan and if you’re actually embracing the change, because it will be scary at first. 

Go gettim, Tiger."
depression,eoe9etz,t3_brffm6,1558491114.0,"I’m sorry, but I’m going to have to disagree. It’s not that they don’t take it seriously. Most people just don’t understand it. As weird of a concept as it is for some on this subreddit to understand waking up and not feeling the overwhelming sense of dread (for others it might be immediate feelings of wanting to commit suicide or the numbness that comes with nihilism) we’re all just a bunch of people trying to find other open minded people that’ll really take the time to sit down and listen. And more importantly, this is life or death. So it needs to be taken seriously. 

In my case, when I would teeter between joking about killing myself just so I could cope/maybe get a laugh, and then the actual serious threats against my life... the first people to respond were the ones that listened to the joke initially but always kept it in the back of their mind. That way they could be ready just in case if things got serious. They’ve saved my life on a few occasions. 

You can’t expect every stranger to spring into action unless they truly are nice people with good intentions. And you can’t expect self absorbed “friends” to spring into action, because they might see you as someone who could bring down their mood and slow down their progress. Which, depending on their age, I don’t blame them. I’m in my 20’s and lost a lot of friends a few years ago because they saw me as toxic. 

My BPD, PTSD from my accident, my anxiety, and my depression are seen as nothing but baggage to someone that refuses to let “toxicity” slow them down. 

My advice is to take the time to try and find some genuinely patient and understanding people. That was had for me since I have BPD and want to be friends with everyone, but it is worth it. 

I still struggle with making friends, but I know the few I have are in for the long run. And my fiancé (going on 9 years soon) is the only real support I need right now. I would really love a group of friends, but it happens in stages. 

I’d recommend your first step be to stop chasing approval from others, but also don’t only make friends if you’re looking for someone to vent to. They’ll pick up on that and no one wants to be a punching bag. 

Just keep pushing, and if you need to talk then I’ll be here. Just. Keep. Going.  Looking back, a lot of this might have been me rambling, but I hope it’s somewhat coherent. 

I think I’m going to try and be more involved in this subreddit. I’m just sure what most people want from their posts. Either groups of people saying they’re doing the same thing, or maybe some actual help. I’m just here to tell you there can be a way out. Maybe not our entirely, but you could maybe get to a point where you’re back holding the reigns. 

I want to bring back some hope to the hopeless. I might get downvoted for not just joining in and disagreeing, but I’m here to tell you there can be way out it but you’ve gotta work hard. Get used
To being uncomfortable. That’s the only way, bud. Good luck. HMU if you want to talk more, I’ll be on here more often. 

This place could use some hope. Whether it goes in one ear and out the other or if it sticks and starts you in a new path. You can be back in control if you really want it. Feel better,
man. Goodnight"
BPD,eobbfw1,t3_br7yhy,1558439008.0,"I don’t think I ever got any better at handling breakups. I just kept pushing and found someone who is extremely patient. 

If I can recommend anything it’s find someone that shares that virtue. I’ve been with my now fiancé for almost 9 years. I was a fucking dickhead for the first 2 years. Spontaneous mood swings, jealousy, you name it. I thought for a good while that she was “too perfect.” I even wanted to leave her for that reason. I was used to dating people that yelled back when I started a fight. But she just wasn’t having it. She learned pretty quickly the difference between when I was genuinely angry or when I was just trying to be difficult on purpose. Then some therapy and 1 on 1’s with her helped me realize why I started all those random fights... I just wanted her attention. 

It didn’t get better overnight. You just chip away at it a bit at a time. I’m still a dickhead to people and can’t build a lasting friendship to save my life. So, don’t think being with someone will fix your ability to develop relationships altogether. 

There’s someone out there that will give you plenty of attention and you won’t have to go through your usual means of getting it. So, how did I get to this place? I just kept trying. That’s really the best answer that I can think of. I hope this helps."
