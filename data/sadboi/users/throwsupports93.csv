sex,fmr6s5w,t3_fwwjmv,1586315211.0,"Personally I dislike the ""specific acts must be reciprocated because one partner does them"" mentality. If you enjoy giving that's great. Enjoy away. If you enjoy receiving, that's great, your partner should do their best to do so for you. However, if they don't enjoy giving, as long as they are finding ways to compromise, I don't expect my partner to do it, especially if it's not a need for me. As in not the only way I can get off. 

Which for me it isn't. I'm like you, I enjoy giving bj's but not always recieving oral myself. So I'm fine if my boyfriend doesn't. He has though and probably would still if I asked, I stopped asking for it because I didn't want it that much after a while. So idk about if I was with an unwilling partner. If they at least willing to try with me once and if afterwards they expressed a dislike, I wouldn't care. At least they tried. But I wouldn't expect it to be reciprocated just because I give, as I do it for my enjoyment as much as his. More so than his actually.  Lol"

And that doesn't mean they can't have sex of course. They just don't have the need/desire to basically. Or sometime only under certain circumstances.

But like I said, we both try to understand each other. He does his best to make me feel good, and I do my best npt to make him feel pressured."
sex,fhtbeax,t3_f4pbld,1581872825.0,"Sorry it's long! I really want to share this! Visiting my boyfriend for valentine's. I booked a room for the night as a surprise since we both live with family and so whenever we visit each other, we're long distance, we don't really have a place totally to ourselves. 

Well, my boyfriend has some hangups around sexually things, on top of being somewhat asexual. So we've struggled with that as time has passed in our relationship. We are each others first everything so initially he didn't realize he wasn't into it. And has become less so over time. At first it was just all new and exciting.

Well anyway, when I told him the night before about the room he had a bad reaction. He felt pressured that us staying in a room for valentine's meant we'd have to do more than he is ready for. Of course that's not true, but that's how it made him feel and it was super awkward. I even told him we didn't have to go if he really didn't want to. But then he reassured me that we still should. 

Long story I know, but the background was needed. We went to the hotel on valentine's and had a nice relaxing time just watching shows and went out to eat and just enjoying time alone. It was great.

The next morning I was laying on him, despite having all the room in the world on that bed, lol. Well I sat up and he pokes my boob. He goes, well it's just sitting out there. I had a bra on and had slept in a hoodie that was partially unzipped. I told him I wasn't complaining. After a moment he starts massaging my boob. Lol. Well not to go into every detail, he starts to play with them like I enjoy them being. Even managed to get my bra off...I normally don't even wear one.

I start kissing him, take off his shirt and just kiss all over and massage him. Then I go down on him. It's been a while between not seeing him much and him just not really being into anything. I've barely got going when he says he's close to finishing. I look up and kind of pout, he normal last longer and I wasn't even sure I was doing that much. But sure enough. He apologized so I just was like it's fine. I was a little flattered actually. Lol.

He cleaned off and came back to get me off. So he is using his finger and it feels great. Maybe it's just been awhile since we have, but it feels amazing. So I'm totally into it and moaning and stuff and he's poking around down there and just goes, ""squishy"". I found that funny and start to giggle but at the same time I must have been orgasming a little cause I can't even fully laugh as I'm also moaning. So he starts laughing at that which made the whole thing funnier. I just bust out laughing now. He apologizes for ruining the mood, but I told him it was okay and as the laughter died we kept going. 

Well he is hitting just the right spot and I guess cause we are actually alone for once and don't have to worry about family walking in, I just completely let go and I utter an ""oh f***"". I never curse, so he's never heard me say that so he just laughs, saying he's never heard me say that before.

Well I finish, thinking I started laughing again because of his surprise at me cursing. I'm always kind of tired afterwards so between that and all the laughing, I was wiped. So he just held me a long while until we were ready to get up...

I don't expect things like this to happen much, but I'm glad this did. I'm glad he initiated it. It felt like how it used to when it was all new and exciting. I miss that."
sex,fhd1tfv,t3_f28tw5,1581475496.0,"Genuinely hating? Not sure. Disliking but still willing to is a different story. My boyfriend and I were new to any kind of romantic, intimate relationship. So everything was a first time for us. And long story short, found out along the way he's asexual (and possibly has some past issues that need to be worked through). A lot of what we started out enjoying together, he enjoyed giving me pleasure, he came to realize he himself didn't enjoy. So when he started opening up about that it made me really uncomfortable to be intimate with him, because he said those things made him uncomfortable. But he still would say he would do them and was sorry he didn't want to as well. He wanted to want to, just didn't. So it's been hard because then I'd start not allowing him to do things for me because I knew he didn't like them on his own. But then it was like, I wasn't allowing him to do stuff for me that he knew I liked and wanted and it's been a hard time. I don't want him to feel like I'm rejecting his efforts. I do appreciate them. But I feel uncomfortable knowing he doesn't want them on his own."

virgin,fcxkcuy,t3_ejc64n,1578065050.0,"Misery loves company. Those people are connecting with people like them. People just as ignorant to the toxicity they both have. Feeding off each other.

Nothing worth being envious about there.

Now as for people more like the majority here, it really just depends. Again, misery loves company. So not everyone will have to improve themselves (lose weight, work on their mental health, etc) in order to find someone. They might just find someone as content with their flaws as they are. That's key there, those people are likely content with themselves, flaws and all. Or even if they aren't they don't really care to improve, and just ignore it or blame everything else. 

Then there's peopke like us, we are aware of our flaws and aren't content with them. We want to change. That can manifest in different ways. Either you are a person who wants to self improve that is down on yourself till you reach that point you think is worthy of others. In which case you might kind of push others away, maybe unintentionally by how you carry yourself. Or you accept you have flaws and are working on them and are honest about that. Not letting the fact you haven't fixed everything about yourself stop you. But be open that you are working on it. 

People who aren't miserable aren't going to want to be with someone who is. And as you can see, the majority of ways I listed are people being miserable. Either in ignorance or not or even if they are working on flaws they are hiding that and striving for perfection and that is bringing them down."

sex,fabffah,t1_fab8t66,1575922403.0,"That I totally understand. I think partners should definitely be open to trying things for their partner, and if they really don't like something be open to finding other ways to meet their needs. Not liking something doesn't mean you get to be selfish. You can try other things."
sex,faben5j,t1_fab8ywt,1575922060.0,"That makes complete sense. I'm not saying people shouldn't try to accommodate their partner's needs. But at the same time I think that goes both ways and if there's something they just aren't down for that's okay too. But definitely they should want to try to find ways to make it better, even if it's finding an alternative."
DirtyConfession,fab2ph2,t1_fab1ohs,1575916924.0,Thanks!
sex,fab0mq0,t1_faazl06,1575916127.0,The skewed perspective is probably true.
sex,faazprs,t1_faayhog,1575915765.0,"Hmm. I guess ever case is different but yeah, often there's a bigger issue than what the OPs initially bring up. Like poor communication."
sex,faazkp1,t1_faaxr11,1575915707.0,"Yeah, I guess you will see more complaining than anything else online. Not that they shouldn't ask of course, but in this context we are also missing the full picture. So for me it always just seems like they aren't respecting their partners limits."
DirtyConfession,faa1j5q,t1_fa9mozf,1575899567.0,Cool. May give that a try 😆
DirtyConfession,fa9fs47,t1_fa9fepz,1575872001.0,Definitely hoping so. 😊
sex,fa8g43y,t1_fa6fiui,1575845812.0,"If someone was about to physically force me to preform a sex act I didn't want to, I'd push them. Maybe just a reflex but yes, you are getting pushed away/off."
sex,fa8fuyw,t3_e7vkb7,1575845660.0,"Slow down there. Okay so it's been only 3 months and he seems really new to this from how you are describing things. Or just dense. He can't read minds, be direct when asking for things, unlike your licking comment.

On first read what really stood out is him pushing you. Bigger issue than not going down on you! But after reading the comment on the circumstances of that, it sounded almost like you were physically forcing him to do oral on you. Which is not okay!

I don't know if that was the case but just wanted to point out the bigger issues of getting physically abusive, both of you. Again...3 months in.

Now, looking at your question, it's up to you, if you absolutely need oral to be fulfilled, and he isn't into it, then obviously this isn't going to work. But I, as a female, really don't get this mindset of a guy has to give a girl oral, because she does it for him or wants it. You can certainly have it be a dealbreaker, but he should be allowed to say no to things. You say the first time he initiated himself when you first got together, but none afterwards. Sounds like that might have been his first time and he learned he isn't into it.

I'm not saying either way what you need to do, but respect for partners goes both ways. He shouldn't be selfish and ignore your needs. But you also shouldn't be pestering, or physically forcing him to do things he doesn't want to. If that's something you need and he can't meet it then there's your answer."
Rapekink,fa7p37p,t3_e7fcbc,1575836840.0,"I was just about to make a similar post. I've never been assulted or anything remotely close but I have the kink. Pretty sure mine stems from being rather sex positive in a conservative environment. I felt like I wasn't supposed to want sex, but I did, so in my brain if I was being forced into it then it really wasn't me desiring it, but I could enjoy it. 

It was a bigger interest back when I was single, and kind of faded when I was finally in a sexual relationship. But my relationship hasn't gotten to full on sex so it kind of resurfaced again in the desiring sex when I couldn't have it.

Also just turned on by the general idea of being dominated, but in a caring way. Basically having that kind of deep connection that I can completely put my care in the hands of someone else. So into CNC and free use too."
virgin,f9usdax,t3_e6v55s,1575656845.0,"You are basically creating a self fulfilling prophecy by not stepping out there. You say women are attracted and interested in you but then it fades. It fades because you are holding yourself back from opening up and connecting with them so it makes it feel like you're the one not interested. So of course they lose interest. And that just supports your inner fear of not being good enough/rejection. Which makes you want to open up less and doubt their interest. Rinse and repeat.

Up to you to break the cycle."
