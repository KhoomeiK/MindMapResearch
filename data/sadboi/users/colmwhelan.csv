the term itself seems to imply a element of desire to control/harm another, and/or understanding of wrongness, and/or ability to control the behaviour on the part of the perpetrator.  Am I correct in assuming this?

If I am correct about the above, when does hurtful\\harmful behaviour fail to qualify as abuse?

Furthermore, there appears to be a strong element of moral judgement of the perpetrator inherent in the word.  Agree or disagree?

We don't morally judge people with paranoid schizophrenia who harm others (which happens but not too commonly) to the extent that we do people with personality disorders.  Both are mental illnesses, both most likely developed due to developmental trauma \\ ACEs but we judge the behaviour of one person with one diagnosis significantly less harshly than the other.  Why is this?  Is it justified?  


Finallly, given the above, is abuse a term that needs to be changed to something less pejorative?"

The case for medication in psychiatric illness is a VERY mixed bag, and depending on the illness, the case of medication in many cases falls well below the level that one would require for something like a heart drug or an antibiotic.  The causes of psychiatric illnesses are not well understood, AT ALL!  The neurotransmitter deficiency model was only ever a hypothesis and has never been proven - only poorly correlated.  The method of action of most psychiatric drugs is equally poorly understood and thus, taking psych drugs is a lottery at best."
