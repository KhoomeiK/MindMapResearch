I never got a call, and I tried calling and no one returned my call, so I ended up getting new insurance, only have to pay 73 a month. 2 weeks after I got my new insurance, I get a letter in the mail saying my Medicaid actually got renewed May 1st, so now I have regular and Medicaid and I’m not sure what I want to do now, and I wish someone would have called to tell me that it got renewed.

The Target employee standing outside the sign that says “You Must wear a mask to enter the building”, told him he needs a mask on, which the guy without a mask says “I have a medical condition” and gave him a dirty look and walked in.

I’m under the assumption if you have a medical condition and you don’t wear a mask, should you even walk into a store, let alone be out in public if you won’t wear a mask?

I have asthma and wearing a mask definitely constricts my breathing, but I still sure as shit wear a mask and carry my inhaler with me if I have to be out in public.

Saw the first orthopedic and got a regular mri and it “looked” okay, and she diagnosed it as a contusion, which was weird because I injured myself over lifting a trailer door that was jammed, no blunt force trauma to my shoulder. She kept me at work and had me do physical therapy at the same time. That actually made it worse.

In March, I ended up tearing my trapezius moving a cereal box while zoning my aisles, and my job didn’t want to report that injury, just like they didn’t want me to report the first time my shoulder Snapped.

I ended up getting a lawyer, and got a new orthopedic. He ordered an mri with contrast, and that mri showed my shoulder is actually coming out of my socket, this was after they had me do the pt and work. My new orthopedic took me completely off work, and I’ve been off ever since"

This happened 2 days after my birthday too, so 2020 had been horrible lol, and then you add on covid and it’s just been a nightmare ever since.
