singapore,fr3bgje,t1_fr399fb,1589853827.0,"Maybe not. They most likely will tell you to break up. I tend to see that in such subs. 

But relationship is relationship, is there any reason you need local context? Is it a local issue? Eg bto, cultural, language etc?

I guess most important is healthy communication. Hard to give solid advice because you didn't say what's the problem, and probably you don't want to in a public sphere as well.

What I mean by healthy communication is view yourselves as a team to solve this issue, instead of wanting to win/convince other party. 

Dont use words like ""you always"", ""you never"". Don't accuse them. Use ""i"" statement. Eg "" I feel hurt when you do that"" instead of ""why you do that? Purposely want to hurt me??"" 

My personal tip is be aware of logical fallacies and manipulation tactic such as ""if you really love me you will..."" or eg slippery slopes like ""if you do this, then this, then that, then *something very unlikely to happen*"" 

If you want a listening ear, feel free to PM."

But not ask for cash. Like maybe tell him what food/products you like. Macdonalnds? Steak? Chinese food? Or if you don't want food, make up? Books?

Asking for cash and being continually rude even after he apologized is like materialistic.

 i also am rather interested in childhood education and worked in education, so i can totally discuss parenting in the 'teaching your kids' segment, not the how to feed your kids segment. i read alot of women forums/reddits etc and that also helps. i'm not doing it just to have a topic with them, i'm just genuinely interested. (in reading about it, not interested in putting it into practise though)"

JUSTNOMIL,fqjvnzj,t1_fqjv1px,1589415872.0,"same. everything about housework, my MIL had milsplained to me. because on the very first time she met me, she already made an assumption im a spoiled princess at home whose mum does everything for me. My mum is disabled.i cooked my first meal when i was 10, and i lived alone for two years. just because she babies her entire family she thinks every mother does that. and anyone younger than her is automatically a spoiled kid that cant take care of themselves.

other things she milsplain beside how to hang clothes is how to wash a stupid cup, and how to change bedsheets, and of course her biggest milsplain topic is cooking. she does cook well, but come on you aint gordon ramsay and even he doesnt do that."
