I'm also genuinely wondering: What reasons would you put towards yourself possibly being a narcissist, if you were? Sorry if this feels personal, I'm just trying to help.

Without it though she still wasn't too bad. Just sorta annoying, but nobody's perfect. I recall a very distinct time though where she had empathy for me, genuinely cried once.

NPD,ev1jzv4,t3_chwbhs,1564159965.0,"Well my guess is it'd be human nature working at its finest.

People don't seem to like others who are different to them. People with empathy can't understand people without it, it causes discomfort. we're social creatures we like to be around others who are similar to us. Hence why people would assume you're bad.

The next reason for this i probably because there's a bad rep with NPD. I mean if you have a look around at what some people with the disorder or similar disorders have done it'd be hard to blame them for being worried. Doesn't make their behavior excused though. That's why I lurk these forums. I have so much respect for those who actually put effort into change. 

Lastly: Words, disorders, labels and rumors don't define if you're bad. Your actions do, so try your best to make your actions count.
Hope everyone here continues well with therapy. If it gives any of you some hope. There's been signs of potential (affective) empathy in NPD and the simple logic anyone can change. As the universe doesn't work that way, unfortunately nothing is permanent.

My 2cents."

On the other hand, actually fixing the problem will be a lot harder. I've heard mindfulness meditation can do wonders for people. Hopefully it does in that case, just don't stop telling yourself to be empathetic. Think of ways you can help others whenever possible. If someone's got you upset think about good things that you like about them to balance it out.
