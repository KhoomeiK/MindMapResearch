depression,f29jcbk,t3_dck8hr,1570099146.0,"I feel the same way. I think i must have spent most of my life just daydreaming. In my case, i  daydream about history of a fictional world i made up in my head, i would thought up battles, wars, kings, political relationships, races, timeline, etc. I also would imagine making a video game, animation or movies out of it and think of how the audience(made up of classmates from my high school days) would react to it. 
When i snap back to reality, it make me die inside knowing how shit my actual life actually is and how i did absolutely nothing with any of my ideas and dreams."
