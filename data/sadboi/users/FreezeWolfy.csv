There has actually been a lot of effort from sweatshop workers to attempt to improve working conditions.

I think DID vs BPD can get confusing because BPD can cause issues with identity and dissociation. For me personally, I dissociate a LOT, even sometimes in therapy, however I do not feel this is a split in identity. I do change my name and ideal self often but not in the way DID works, as far as I can tell. I also have PTSD which has developed my dissociative symptoms.
