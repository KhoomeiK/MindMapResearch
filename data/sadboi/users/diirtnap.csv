Of course. 

Is that what I said? No. It's not.

I said that if people are pro VACCINE after watching this video, they're objectively delusional and irrational.

If I show video evidence of a robbery, and people see it and still deny it happened, they are irrational.

>that if I can’t convince them on one matter, that the person is just delusiona

I am simply talking about this particular video, not my ability to convince. This video isn't my work. It's the cdcs work. 

>They have a different perspective on the issue. 

A factually incorrect one, as evidenced by the video."
AntiVaxxers,fhrdkmz,t1_fhqv6vm,1581823565.0,">What about rushing the drug without taking the time to test it?

That's the thing, rushing a drug, should be synonymous with, ""this drug could be dangerous"" to any thinking vaccine scientist.

If they are knowingly rushing the drug, then they should obviously be aware of the potentiality of the risks of that drug being too big, and so are avoiding testing."
DebateVaccines,fhrdd36,t1_fhr905n,1581823419.0,">And please, find me 3 clinical studies that are conducted by scientists that prove vaccines cause autism. And like I said, autism is rarely that bad.

Burden of proof is on you, we are not mandating a lack of vaccines, you're pro mandatory vaccines.
Prove to us they don't. Like with a double blind placebo study, or an unvaxxed Vs vaxxed study of data. They don't exist, and that's concerning, to a very high level."
DebateVaccines,fhrd89v,t1_fhr905n,1581823326.0,">You can't sue the manufacturers because they do not cause autism

If they were safe, they would not worry about lawsuit's.. why does pharma not have liability legally? It's weird and curious isn't it..?

>Only 20% of flu vaccines have mercury

I think it's closer to 50%.

>and it's only 25 mcg. Of it. It would take nearly 400 of those vaccines at least, (1600 in healthy kids or adults) 

Only 24 MCG? It's by far enough to be a problem. It's also injected, injection is massively different to ingestion. Also, age is a factor to play in it's danger.

>you will most likely never die from vaccines if you are not immunocompromised.

And a fair bunch of people are IMMUNOCOMPROMISED, in fact, vaccines cause IMMUNOCOMPROMISATION (sorry caps, typing on phone and it's autocorrected) so you're causing the very problem you want to solve. 

The main thing however, is that mercury isn't the only risk factor in autism. Aluminium, injected live viruses, and DNA fragments are other factors. 

Autism can be caused by brain damage caused by aluminium, mercury and heavy metals in general.

Autism can be caused by gastrointestinal illnesses, caused by vaccine strain measles viruses, like Crohn's disease and leaky gut.
The Gut brain link is huge, your diet massively effects your brain, and it's therefore no surprise that a serious gastrointestinal illness poses great threat to your minds functionality.

Autism can be caused by autoimmunity caused by vaccines, as the body sees itself as a threat, it attacks it's self, and the brain often is the main target. 

Autism can also be caused by psychological abuse, making a child who was neurotypical, become neurologically altered to autistic behaviour.

Also, vaccines can cause future DNA problems, as they contain DNA fragments, RNA fragments, and fetal matter, that actually can alter your own DNA, through a process I can't remember but Dr Theresa deisher, a stem cell researcher has a lot of information about it, if you want to see proper science, as it's 3AM for me and I'm not a stem cell expert."

If I don't do any pre marketing testing on a drug, the only reasoning is because I didn't want people to find something out that I knew. There's no other reason to not do the pre marketing studies."
