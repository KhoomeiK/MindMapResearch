Idk, I feel like we are too vulnerable in certain  areas. Maybe for Paula it was relationships so despite being an experienced counsellor. She was very insecure ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
suits,fgote69,t3_ezmuug,1580985702.0,"Although shouldn't we bear in mind that whether  professionals or not, they are still human. And often we don't make the most ideal choice bcoz well .. Not an ideal world. Ik this is just a show but this just makes me think about things I've done and how they seemed unnecessary or silly but hey, am only human and I think, we tend to think just coz someone has the knowledge on psychology that makes them not be human or make mistakes but it kinda still does.
Also when it comes to relationships and love, I feel rationality often goes out the window.. Coz like it doesn't make sense sometimes but you still are there with the person."

mentalhealth,fep1hcy,t1_fep167t,1579310025.0,"I get your point. I truly do and I have friends who were going through stuff but upon talking felt much better about it.  But.. I feel that it depends on the person, there are people who do like 'the sane thing', let's say, and reach out to people and talk and then there are others who just.. For whatever reason believe in remaining closed up or being a burden to people."
mentalhealth,fep0ygu,t1_fep0qio,1579309697.0,Yeah i get your point. But the thing is.. Isn't it just you who can truly process your emotions? Isn't it just like idk wanting attention or something to likd tell other people that you're sad or anxious or mad or any other emotion.
mentalhealth,feban04,t1_fe9ikzn,1578956965.0,"I weirdly enough do. I like the bit about having the mindset because I feel like that can set the tone for soo many things. Whether you're feeling depressed, manic etc.
However I do wonder the struggle of like trying to feel happy when you're depressed. Like do you think it can just be altered by mindset"

mentalhealth,fe8zwf6,t1_fe8xm95,1578932746.0,But doesn't that make it ironic? Like INSTINCTIVELY you'll try/want to live yet there ‡§à‡§∏‡§æ part of you that wants to die. Like why does this exist if its our instinct to live?
