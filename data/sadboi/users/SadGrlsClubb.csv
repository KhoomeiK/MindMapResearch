ptsd,fds1mqo,t1_fdr24lh,1578692994.0,"I think seeking professional help to navigate those swells would be beneficial. I swear, the lashing out is word for word my experiences in the past lol. 

Best of luck to you and it takes strength to reach out about such subjects. Stay strong ‚ô•Ô∏è"
ptsd,fdpqgcr,t3_emjwx6,1578636624.0,"I think seeking out individual therapy can significantly help with sorting out those feelings, with the hopes of them presenting themselves as anxieties and distrust in your relationship. 

Also, voicing those insecurities with your SO could help significantly, as communication is a major key in any relationship. But if it‚Äôs a conversation that devolves  into an argument every time the subject is broached, see if your SO would be willing to join you in a therapy session to have a third party assist with effectively communicating. 

I am by no means qualified to advise on much, but as a fellow ptsd sufferer, those approaches have helped prevent what would later turn into an unnecessary argument/blow up. I have been cheated on previously and it heightened those insecurities immensely, 

Best of luck."
Drugs,fdnhvs5,t3_embk2s,1578586144.0,"Google can always provide a quick answer, but as someone who has been on probation.. avoid any bumps along the way and just don‚Äôt drink. Find a different escape from drugs and alcohol, if at the very least.. for the remainder of your probation.

The consequences of those actions just aren‚Äôt worth it & if the people you surround yourself with aren‚Äôt the greatest influence, cut back those ties."
ptsd,fdnfjhg,t3_emapgp,1578584726.0,"You‚Äôre absolutely worth existing, although I am fully aware of the effort it takes to continue to wake up, get up, and face the reality we face. However, you‚Äôre not alone in these feelings and although you may feel like the sea constantly changing from calm to ill, your seas will calm. 

I am always here if you need to reach out. I still face the fight, flight, or flee response with nightmares on top of it, so I can absolutely relate. 

Stay strong.

ptsd,fdmigyb,t3_em5m0x,1578551086.0,"Are you in any form of therapy, be it medication or talk? Also, are you forced to see your abuser through something like work? Or is it family? ..I am familiar with having to see one of my abusers, who is a relative, on a couple occasions a year. 

I wish I knew the words to help with the anguish, but know that you are not alone in your fears, and there are avenues to help lessen the reactions to different traumas. My method of coping was to avoid all association, but that meant losing a lot of my family.. who didn‚Äôt believe me anyways. 

Feel free to PM me if you want to talk more & know there is strength in your vulnerability regarding such topics. Stay strong xo"

lonely,fc9ajfz,t3_egrtxr,1577549678.0,"Coming from a fellow lonely creep, everyone suffers feelings of intimidation when starting anew. Being fresh out of a relationship sucks for everyone, but going to school and working is no easy feat. Feeling stagnant in your routine can definitely bring up feelings of restlessness, but focusing on and achieving your goal will be worth it. If you‚Äôre close enough to your friends, perhaps bounce these feelings off of them and see what they say. If not, reddit is always here lol. 

& If you find you‚Äôre unhappy with your direction, it‚Äôs never to late to change it. 

Best of luck in all you do."
lonely,fc99rqn,t3_egry3e,1577549339.0,"Sorry to hear you‚Äôre feeling isolated.. never too late to make a call or send a text to rekindle an old friendship. I‚Äôd also recommend looking into a meetup group for something of your interest. Get yourself to go once, if you hate it.. you‚Äôre back to where you started. My guess is you‚Äôll find that you enjoy it and new friendships can begin to bloom. 

Sending love!"
lonely,fc992cd,t1_fc959dw,1577548986.0,"May I ask when you began your medicine regimen? SSRI‚Äôs can take time for your body to adjust to, and occasionally (at least in my experience) intensify & worsen some of those feelings. I think it‚Äôs extremely important you locate licensed therapist to work through some of the feelings you‚Äôre experiencing.. life can be extremely lonely, I promise I can understand that. I‚Äôd worry less about the relationship and focus more on yourself for the time being. 

As hard as it is, keep going. Love can be lost, school can always be put on hold. You‚Äôre feelings are valid and if you need help locating any resources in your area I‚Äôd be happy to help."
