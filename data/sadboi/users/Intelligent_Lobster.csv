I imagine a bunch of people are going to tell you to just communicate. It can be really hard to talk to someone that isn't interested in communicating with you. I am terrified to talk with my one pal about anything meaningful, because the second I get a little deep she shuts down. She'll say she's not as intelligent as me, which isn't true, she just doesn't go out of her way to educate herself in the slightest. I would suggest explaining exactly how you feel. If it has to be over text, and not in person, that's okay. Don't feel bad about that. But if your friend doesn't respect what you're trying to communicate, I would suggest you move on. Sometimes, people aren't willing to learn and grow. Sometimes, it's not worth holding on to people like that"
