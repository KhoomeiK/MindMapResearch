AskFeminists,fn3iyy9,t1_fn1svx5,1586621689.0,how is biden going to help those less fortunate exactly?
AskFeminists,fn1oyyf,t1_fn0s0tj,1586566768.0,"biden is only slightly better than trump.

in 2002, he was the chair of the senate committee on foreign relations. he swayed dems to support bush’s goal to invade iraq. he selected witnesses to testify in senate hearings that just straight up lied about how iraq handled al-quaida activity and lied about the capabilities of missiles they possessed. 

1 million iraqi people were killed.

biden cosponsored the Kosovo resolution, which led to 500 dead yugoslavian citizens. 
if you think biden is going to quell foreign relations, you’re wrong. 

biden threatened to pull $1 billion from the Ukrainian govt if they did not fire prosecutor general viktor shokin. shokin was investigating burisma holdings, a natural gas company that hunter biden was a board member of. 
if you believe biden cares about the environment, you’re wrong. 

biden plans to revamp obamacare, despite the law itself being too complex for even blue states to act on—rather than work towards single payer health, biden believes capping premiums and lowering deductibles would be the most sensible. this is incorrect.
because the ACA is tricky to navigate, that exponentially increases the cost to a) enact it b) the work healthcare providers’ billing departments must do. also—low-income people pay for the second cheapest silver plan available to them—biden plans to move them to a gold plan, but does not intend on changing how which plan they will get is determined. people pay needlessly more for healthcare, people still pay higher deductibles than necessary. as well—the trump administration has lowered the average services that insurers must cover from 70% to 66%. this does not necessarily save poor people money. 
if you believe biden cares about people having access to healthcare, you’re wrong."

what happens to women’s confidence when theyre no longer in high demand for porn bc the industry sees them as “used up”? acting has a hierarchal structure; most women who go into the field will not become very popular, thus not allowing them a career beyond maybe a year in sex work, IF THEYRE LUCKY. you can’t tell me that the validation they receive will last for as long as they’d enjoy. 

it’s also honestly a class issue—women who are very poor, very desperate are much more likely to be taken advantage of than bourgeois white girls who put a link to their only fans in their twitter bios. it leads me to believe that maybe only relatively well-off women who could rely on mom and dad for financial support are the only ones that could ever conceive it as uplifting or whatever."
