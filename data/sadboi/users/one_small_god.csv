depression,fov1vmg,t3_g9ndgw,1588094035.0,"Friendly reminder that stress, and depression and anxiety have effects on your memory and the way you experience time also. My first, first, first advice is see a therapist when you're able to. And don't think that you're weird or unusual because that's happening to you. This is a side effect of a sickness that you have (depression), like any other sicknesses.

Edit to add: after I recovered from my first major depressive episode, I didn't have a *personality* anymore. Like, what kind of person was I? What kind of things did I like? Nothing. I had to find out/build out those things again. I vividly remember telling this to a friend and him telling me ""you're a decent person, and a smart person, if this is happening to you it's happening to a lot of other people too, you're not the first."" This had strangely comforted me, like knowing that this wasn't a weird thing I was doing to myself or that I was failing at that was my fault, you know? Same applies to you.

Let me preface this by saying I don't have any siblings and have always wished I had. But since she's doing this, why are you not doing it back? It's easy to say ""your hair is shit"" ""your makeup is caked as hell"" or ""as pretty as you look it doesn't change that you're dumb/soulless"" like the kinds of things she says. Because I'm guessing you've tried the other route of trying to be friends with her, purposefully ask her opinion on things, etc? 

I wonder why she's doing it. Does she genuinely not like you? Is there a visible dynamic in your family / wider family where one of you is loved more? 

I did suggest dishing it out to her in return, but in the end I hope things turn out well between you guys. Maybe if you dish it out, either she becomes frustrated and you have a talk, or she doesn't care and you let off some steam so that you can stop caring too.

Saved it to watch later, don't know how long I'll stick by it since it seems a bit darker/more serious than I usually like but at least it'll scratch the itch."

Anxiety,fo0un3e,t1_fo0mn01,1587420075.0,SAME. Damn.
Anxiety,fo0um0o,t3_g4y8e7,1587420059.0,"Same boat. Remember that stress, anxiety, depression can really fuck up your memory or active comprehension speed. I remember being in the masters programme, and being very anxious, I didn't understand a subject in a course, and I really remember that moment that the professor was explaining again, but I still didn't understood - that moment just etched into my brain, that first time I wasn't able to understand something that others were able to. Dropped out of the masters in the end.

I found my peace of mind when I stopped identifying as ""the smart girl"" - so when you can't remember or instantly understand something, or don't perform upto the expectation of others, you don't feel like you're losing an integral part of yourself. ""Smart"" isn't one of the 3 adjectives that I'd use to define myself anymore, though I can still understand things fairly easily and love logic puzzles, that's not something I'm proud of or actively pursue anymore. As a result, I'm much more relaxed.

Edit: don't know if you're going to read this but I had often been told when I was little that ""I was so smart I didn't even had to study anything to be good at it"". Which ended up resulting in me feeling like my success in any area wouldn't be worth anything if I had to study for it - cue me feeling like I had to be good at courses without doing any work, and being miserable when didn't happened. Beware if you're bogged down by a similar feeling!"

It just accured to me that when C was taking care of/helping the other students, esp those in her house, she was doing it in a way someone takes care of their children, or younger siblings - not in the way you take care of your friends."

HPfanfiction,fo08hhs,t1_fo0523c,1587407923.0,"I can't make the SPOILERS work either so any future readers beware please!

I guess I was kinda hoping for a more utopically happy ending, or was sad how C was so disassociated from being H in the end, and how the rest of the trio would be devastated for a loss that wasn't actually a loss (or maybe a half-loss, with the dissociation). I see the ""a relationship requires honesty"" point of view, but really felt like Nott wasn't more deserving of the truth than the others, if that makes sense? It was also weird to see C caring so much about the pureblood part of the society, but after spending so much time with them maybe that was inevitable. 

As for an alternate ending: I was actually rooting for a merge of memories/personalities on both sides, like having a clone of yourself, in two different bodies and conspiring together.

Agree with the sequel on the plot aspect. I also wish we could've seen more of the developing relationships between the characters as well!"
HPfanfiction,fo045kr,t1_fo02lpm,1587405760.0,"I think I've seen this one mentioned here before, will check it out! This is the second time I've seen ""In the bleak midwinter"" used as a title since watching the show Peaky Blinders - though that might just be me noticing the phrase more now. The words bring me chills everytime I hear them. (The other one is a new sci-fi webcomic series on webtoons, so a very different concept, haha) 

Coming back to Hermione - I DID read the sequel, and was sad that there wasn't more of it. Were you disappointed with the resolution of the body-problem, or how things turned out with the trio?

I admit I'm a bit skittish about a Hermione going back to Marauder-era, sounds a bit like it would be mostly wish-fulfullment to get together with a marauder - that might just be prejudice on my part though."
