MakeupAddiction,fk2u8l1,t1_fk2n1fm,1583809299.0,"Waterproof: Lancôme Monsieur Big—this stuff is legit. I got drunk, cried, swam in a fountain, cried again in said fountain, and then went back to the bar. Was I soaking wet? Yes. But my mascara. was. FLAWLESS.

Non-waterproof: Glossier Lash Slick or Clinique Fit mascara. Both formulas are non-irritating, don’t smudge, and have pretty great staying power. Hope this helps!"
