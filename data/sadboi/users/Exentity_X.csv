cedarrapids,fqj3ry0,t1_fqj2tva,1589404648.0,"I understand that. But at the same time, if we did our job of social distancing, we shouldn’t have to worry too much. Some places even go as far as gloves, which could even make it worse. If you wear a mask and gloves, you’re probably going to be itching your face or something and boom the gloves are contaminated. Sure, they can be helpful for very, very short term, but for a full store trip even, not exactly. Then again, everyone is entitled to their own opinion."

If you don't believe me, look up a video on it, they're readily available. If you'd like the guy's name, I'd happily give it. But then again, it is everyone's option to choose, and I'm not gonna make anyone do anything. It's up to the stores and the managers :).

Another thing, I'm not saying that this applies to everyone, but it applies to the people that are completely healthy.

And also, masks do not have zero purpose, they actually DO prevent people who are infected from infecting others, but does not protect others from getting infected themselves.

The masks are only really effective if someone that has symptoms is going out on their own will instead of staying in quarantine.
