BPD,fp1ezf9,t3_gaoaxf,1588233288.0,"Agreed. Most of us have trauma of some form. If we dont apologise and try and change when we're hurtful then we're just doing unto others what we desperately dont want done to us. Nobody gets a free pass to hurt people no matter how hurt they are inside. 
I'm frequently mean to people I love because of my disorder. So we sat down together and worked out ways of diffusing situations that blow up quickly. I try to be more open about my triggers and Express my upset instead of converting it to anger. And it's not always perfect! I fuck up and they fuck up. But we apologise to each other because without admitting I'm doing something wrong I'll do it over and over again.
Committing hurtful behaviours then blaming other people from your past is an easy cycle to get into, I reckon we've all done it many times, but its abusive to yourself and those you love to stay in it, and you Can remedy it with hard work."
