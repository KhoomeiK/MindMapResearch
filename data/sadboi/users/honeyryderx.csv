If we do it or push it then we will only harm ourselves.  I literally can‚Äôt do anything unless God allows it.  I‚Äôve tried opening my own doors, and they will no open no matter how hard I tried.  He even forced me to start my own company (something I really didn‚Äôt want to do), but He brought me a perfect first client too.  So I know He‚Äôs working in me, I have no idea what‚Äôs next I just surrender and try to flow (trust) with Spirit.  None of which are easy things to do, as I‚Äôm sure you know.

SpiritualAwakening,etchz6f,t3_cb1asf,1562685202.0,"I understand completely.  All I can do is share my experience, I believe in God and as I would interview with companies I never got the job, the doors were always closed.  Then God opened up a door - he brought me a client which forced me to start my own company.  So now I work 20 hours a week, from home, when I want.  My advice is to interview but if there are signs that tell you not to take the job then don‚Äôt.  It means God has something better planned for you."
SpiritualAwakening,espdf9k,t3_c8q828,1562182652.0,"Yes I‚Äôve been there, just starting to come out the other side (I think, I hope).  I found strength in learning the truth about this world, God (an actual being not just an obscure energy), and myself.  My advice is to have compassion with yourself.  Hindsight is 20/20, so of course you can see your mistakes, but you can‚Äôt change them, you made the choices you made at the time with the knowledge you had at the time to make them.  Just know you have grown, so now you have the ability to see where you‚Äôve gone wrong.  No regrets, can‚Äôt change the past, focus on the present.  Trust God that He‚Äôll work everything out for your good (this is where developing a relationship with God comes in, you can‚Äôt trust what you don‚Äôt know).  You don‚Äôt need anything, no crystals, no reiki, no tarot, no psychics, just surrender and flow.  Dark night of the soul is a good thing to look up but it isn‚Äôt very encouraging.  It‚Äôs a process that takes patience and time.  Everyone‚Äôs journey is different.  Know you aren‚Äôt alone and God loves you very much."

Getting to know and understand God has helped me tremendously.  He is making us a new creation, pruning the things from our fast that no longer serve us.

I agree the current system of this world sucks, I believe it is changing as we evolve and come to truth."

antiwork,epcvkiz,t1_epcq1t3,1559158956.0,"I think there is an achievable happy medium that works for everyone.  But we don‚Äôt have the leadership to organize it and execute it.  I love to work when it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm interested in and enjoy.  In our modern day you have to select a niche and then you are pretty much stuck to that niche for the rest of your life unless you are willing to start over at the bottom.  It‚Äôs messed up.  For example my knowledge and experience could be applied to many different things but I‚Äôm stuck in an industry that I no longer enjoy, it‚Äôs not challenging.  So I have to either go back to school (which costs tons of money just to get the ‚Äúdegree‚Äù to get me an interview), or start at the ground floor making close to minimum wage (I‚Äôd have to sell my house, car, etc.), or maybe get lucky and come across someone who could get me into the new industry.  We are so limited, which to me is enslavement.  

Plus if technology keeps making us more efficient why do we still work 40 hour work week, on average?  I‚Äôm well aware that 40 nowadays is the minimum.  Seriously, why aren‚Äôt humans cashing in on the technology by working less hours???  Our health in every aspect possible is on the line, especially in USA.  We are declining physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually.  All of which could be improved if we didn‚Äôt have to all work so much.  It makes more sense to have one person in a household working rather than all adults.  There‚Äôs no time."

I think God was trying to get a message to me and He knew I would listen to her.  He works thru whomever He wants.  He doesn‚Äôt limit Himself to our man made labels and titles.  I am not religious (and at the time I had recently learned the dark side of the ‚Äúchurch‚Äù so I was afraid of it) therefore it‚Äôs not like He could have worked through a Pastor/Priest.  Not saying He doesn‚Äôt or couldn‚Äôt, but it wouldn‚Äôt have had a positive impact on me."
