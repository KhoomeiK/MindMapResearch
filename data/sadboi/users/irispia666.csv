EngagementRings,fczrg6j,t1_fczr4ff,1578107355.0,"I wasn’t being rude, just giving you an honest rational educated answer, you just didn’t like my answer so decided to be the rude one and give me attitude! That’s your problem not mine.  Grow up miss paranoia"
EngagementRings,fczqueq,t1_fczqr8v,1578107040.0,Lol you’re delusional and paranoid
EngagementRings,fczqomh,t1_fczqeil,1578106944.0,Real diamonds are grown in the earth not man made! So therefore you have a cubic zirconia! Enjoy! Lol
EngagementRings,fczq9x1,t1_fczq6qa,1578106722.0,"Sis, a lab grown diamond is a cubic zirconia sorry to burst your bubble"
EngagementRings,fczq7ac,t3_ej4mif,1578106683.0,If you’re going to spend 8 grand on a diamond you might as well get a quality real diamond . Why spend that much on a cubic zirconia it makes no sense.
EngagementRings,fczpxyl,t1_fczpvoc,1578106542.0,But That’s what it is I meant no offense!
EngagementRings,fczplo2,t3_ej0w57,1578106348.0,Looks like something I wore in the early nineties if that’s what you’re going for it’s great
EngagementRings,fczpiaj,t3_eisgf6,1578106297.0,Wow what a beautiful cubic zirconia!
EngagementRings,fczofv6,t3_ejlqx5,1578105680.0,Go for a third opinion or just leave it alone.  I’m sure a reputable diamond dealer would sell you a quality piece of jewelry and your fiancé wouldn’t buy you junk.  To question it seems very rude to your fiancé in all honesty.  Have a level of trust in both the store and your fiancé.  Let the man be a man and stop fretting it’s not beneficial to anyone.
EngagementRings,fczo8kd,t3_ejpdjo,1578105559.0,Get an eternity band
EngagementRings,fcznryi,t3_eizmo6,1578105273.0,"Lol he probably is just wondering your gold preference, (gold) (white gold ) and your taste level to buy you a piece of jewelry , If he really wanted to know what style of ring you liked he would have asked you! don’t get ahead of yourself and get set up for disappointment when he buys you a necklace"
EngagementRings,fcyqlo0,t3_eiq48f,1578085061.0,Lan grown diamond? Ha what a way to celebrate eternal love
EngagementRings,fcyqi0l,t3_ejaaqz,1578085005.0,Not many options for you considering the flatness of the opal.   Seems plausible to not wear one at all.
EngagementRings,fcyq9st,t3_eiww3d,1578084875.0,The box is silly over the top and non ornamental.  Couldn’t imagine giving this masculine big wooden box to a woman.  Lol
EngagementRings,fcypp0e,t3_ej7t0b,1578084557.0,Say nothing I’m sure they will notice on their own.  No need to show off a piece of jewelry it’s highly visible why can’t women understand this
EngagementRings,fcypflj,t3_ejg238,1578084415.0,I personally never take mine off.
EngagementRings,fcypckq,t3_ejiuud,1578084369.0,Looks like an omnivorous
EngagementRings,fcyp8dp,t3_ejix7c,1578084304.0,Pretty
EngagementRings,fcxydmx,t3_ejg9b0,1578072173.0,It’s unattractive. The dainty nature of the setting combined with the specs of diamonds make for a very uninteresting and non sparkly piece of jewelry.  It also looks ultra masculine.  Please don’t propose with this ring.
EngagementRings,fcrepxm,t3_eiifux,1577900834.0,Lol at the positioning of the fingers
EngagementRings,fcp2xem,t3_edhmnp,1577848837.0,Is that a yellow diamond?

EngagementRings,fcofwfz,t3_ehwcuc,1577831258.0,I disagree with the posters and your sister here.  I think the ring and setting is beautiful.
EngagementRings,fcghlsl,t3_egsrly,1577640131.0,Okay but why is there no sparkle
EngagementRings,fcfyjtn,t3_egzxzq,1577634861.0,Is that a yellow diamond?
EngagementRings,fcatm5p,t3_edfxeg,1577576365.0,Get her a three quarter carat.  The size you picked is too small especially if her ring finger is bigger than a 4.5
EngagementRings,fcapq5w,t1_fcapo70,1577574116.0,Just telling the truth! My ring sparkles like crazy!!
