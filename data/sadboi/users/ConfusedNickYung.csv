I understand that women's clothing industry is very unforgiving, they make pants without pockets so you have to buy their purses (which looks really pretty, mind you, but not everyone needs them). I think you should have a conversation with your parents to see if you guys could come up with a plan together to see if you can purchase your clothes elsewhere. Any parent will want their kids to look less sexualized."

There were classmates of mine that would go to another continent on their family private jets for a day or two over the weekends and come back in time for school again. Others would own a 6-digit dollar wristwatch. Whenever we went on certain school trips that involved shopping in malls, some would buy a new suitcase just so they could carry their other newly purchased stuff in it, while i would save up money to buy a pair of shoes or a backpack. I'm not pinching pennies but whenever i make any purchases that are bigger than the regular fast food and snacks, i tend to do all research i can about them and take time to think it over before pulling the trigger."
