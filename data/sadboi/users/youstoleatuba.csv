Also if you don't want to spend too much I've never used one but the A series phones seem pretty alright."

It's a decent phone. I got the e because it's smaller and it's pretty much same size which is nice. No LED doesn't bother me because the screen can turn a colour or the edge of it so it's fine.

nrl,fl600qr,t3_fmsrs8,1584850301.0,Ok I have an important question about the use of cameras in the NRL. When it comes to put downs where the player goes into touch and it's very close if they went into touch first or if they got the ball down or not. Well the cameras use I assume 25/30fps cameras as it's very choppy when the ball is put down. We are basing our decisions on the few frames we get from the camera. If we had even 60fps cameras for the try line we would have twice the amount of frames to be able to more properly see how close a put down was. There was a denied try last year where the ball was put down at the same time as hand into touch. But there was a big jump in motion from the previous frame to the simultaneously grounding frame. If you had another few frames in there we could have seen more. What do you guys think?

nrl,fkgbqdg,t3_fhxm9t,1584155117.0,"My thoughts on the game not that many are too interested.
I thought we were lacking. We can't blame the loss on the refs or anyone else. We missed crucial tackles. We bungled great opportunities with errors or players, namely Hampton for one but there were others, being out a of position. We lacked trust in each other. We had players rush in when they should have held their line. Val wasn't a superstar but did well enough for to first game  back. Kicking was off though. Marsters was pretty good in attack. Defense could work on. Our big guys jason good as always. McLean not doing as much as I'd hoped for but game one so let him work on it. Not sure why wright was dropped from.the bench. Suppose a big guy like Jensen is better against a big forward pack like  the Broncos but wright was missed. A lot to work on. Showed some signs at the end there on the come back but we don't want to have to crawl our way back every game. Was good to see Granville run a bit and keen to see how him and Robson go. Let's go boys!"
nrl,fkgb3ln,t3_fiahrh,1584154623.0,You COULD argue that well it wasn't that bad. Or every other player does it. But the fact this bloke is constantly vetting suspended shows you it's more a problem with him rather than simply wrong place wrong time.
nrl,fkgax6x,t3_fiaspp,1584154486.0,Look from what I've read we could be locked out for only a few weeks because the scientists and people need some buffer time to work on stuff before it becomes widespread. But could go either way.

nrl,fk3b90z,t1_fk3b14t,1583825123.0,"Look I would have loved Opacic to get starting crack at centre. But they are saying O'Neill has been looking really good, of course they would say that I know, but I'm hoping he's firing. He actually was going pretty well last year before he got injured, I thought anyway. As for hampton, yea, that shocked me. Although what are our other options? Tualagi? Who is very inexperienced, would love to see him play more but a big game like this greeny is looking for experience. Hamiso obviously wasn't gonna get the spot. Could have put O'Neill on the wing and opacic back in the team. A few other options. It could definitely be better but it's not the worst of the worst options. Hampton is a really good utility, my only concerns will be defending on the wing. He played on the wing a few times last season and had some good plays, let's just hope he shows up for us. And also he obviously doesn't have the natural diving skills that other wingers have, like feldty, he's no slouch but we can't be expecting spectacular finishes. But I'll be happy if he surprises me."
