Dating? I’ve been married for 15 years, and can tell you that the only way to find the right someone is to put yourself out there. Hard, I know. I’ve been lucky. I’ve also found that telling people that I’m a bipolar basket case has been met with kindness and interest. 

Just upfront with all your shit. Good and bad. Just lay it out. You’ll find someone that wants YOU and maybe you’ll put more people at ease with understanding who you are. People are uncomfortable with things they don’t understand and can’t anticipate. “Oh, so you’re bipolar...that makes sense”.
