BPD,fqj65so,t3_giltnk,1589405575.0,"Thank you for this. I began to recognize my behavior as abusive only two years ago (Iâ€™m 31) and even though itâ€™s tough, it does help to try to get better for your loved ones not to suffer. It feels like a good reason, to me, to learn how to handle myself better. Itâ€™s still incredibly hard when something difficult is going on, but at least I am aware."
BPDmemes,fp3ikgy,t3_gawgqo,1588279924.0,"Mindfulness is great but sometimes we just canâ€™t. This shall pass, too... till then, indulge yourself."

But you do. Thatâ€™s why you keep it secret. 
As someone said, itâ€™s not new that relationships donâ€™t work out due to having different fetishes... but I think if you open up about your world to her, and offer her to be your Goddess, she might try, and who knows!
Just do not lie again to her or any other woman, ever."
relationship_advice,foy5ysj,t1_fnve5n1,1588166081.0,This is so right. Ask her to be your FinDomme and show her your devotion!
BPDmemes,fouuuxm,t1_fouuk20,1588090783.0,"Did you try guided meditation? I get super anxious when I have to meditate or breathe all by myself with no sounds, but guided works better for some reason.
Mindfulness is a different thing, is more about to paying attention to what you are doing only, there are great videos about it on YouTube."
BPDmemes,fouoxhj,t1_fopx8ze,1588087961.0,"Mindfulness helps, meditation, anything that helps you learn to be present and not lost in your own thoughts. But you have to learn how to live using that in your daily life"
BPDmemes,fooiwnd,t1_fogwke3,1587939858.0,Stay more present I guess
