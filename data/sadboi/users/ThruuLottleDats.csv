I often said it helped me aswell but in hindsight, it ensured my depression and the results of it was the small list I named in previous comment.

My first psychologist told me that if I wanted therapy to work, I had to quit smoking. 

Ah yeah, theres always that. I hope you have enough to atleast get going a bit, a lot of people with mental issues never seek help which only makes it worse, not only for them but also for immediate family and friends."
mentalhealth,fqwnld5,t1_fqwn2r2,1589711119.0,"Weed can also cause an awful lot of mood swings. 
I smoked a fuckton back in the day and it cost me my college, my friends and a girlfriend, simply because I was unable to express what I was going through. That inability for me caused a lot anger and frustration that burst out at the most random moments. Havent smoked in 7 years and my mood is much more stable now then it was then.

GP's should be available everywhere. Simply google it in your living area. They are mandatory where I live because insurance wants them to refer you to hospital and such otherwise they wont pay for it. 

If possible, get into contact with that therapist and see if you can set something up."
mentalhealth,fqwmjwj,t1_fqwlzuz,1589710017.0,"You answer the tests based on a set of questions you have to answer based on last week and/or last month. So they do take into considersion the immediate past. 

Keep in mind that all those tests are snapshots of your current situation, not past or future. In therapy, if you get a good one that actually does it instead of pushing pills, you can dig deeper into the past which makes it easier to find the roots for certain behaviours. Like being told as a kid to shut up everytime you expressed sadness will lead to problems with emotional expression in adolescence, as an example.

Psychologists are still unsure about the whole ""running in the family""-nature vs the whole ""I grew up exposed to""-nurture debate in regards to mental illness in families. Both are defining factors but they are still squabbling about how much.

In the end, the tests are generalized and the in-depthness comes with therapy. Do go for that instead of pills...pills will only hide the problems + you can get dependant/addicted to them."
mentalhealth,fqwln5p,t1_fqwkxks,1589709019.0,"Personal observations can be clouded by negative experiences. Hence the objective view from someone that doesnt know you is so important for that diagnosis. 

A GP is a general practitioner. Basically your personal doctor before medical specialists get into play. 

It takes balls to make a decision to stand by it and I've had moments where I was like, if I'd get a girl pregnant, I'd honour her wishes and do my best to support her. 

If you're into movies and could do with some perspective, Knocked Up is one about an upcoming, unplanned kid. Its obviously a movie so its all dramatized and such but it can help with that bit."
mentalhealth,fqwksxe,t1_fqwkdby,1589708109.0,"Having that professional diagnose will do more for you in that regard than knowing. The professional will get you the help you need. GP's can do a lot already and reading the no-insurance I'd say American...cuz general healthcare is bad appearantly. 

Dont be a norm, be an outlier."
mentalhealth,fqwkmab,t1_fqwk359,1589707909.0,"I'm not criticizing anyone. Without the OBJECTIVE view from a professional and a very intensive test (I had to take 5 seperate tests for my diagnosis of schizotypical personality, since then changed, avoidance personality, still somewhat here, and severe depression, less severe now) you cant say for certain if you're depressed and what to do with it.

 Mood changes are present in a large variety of mental issues and for the better part of my severe depression-period I did not experience any emotions at all. My affect was flat and expressing or even recognising them was non-existant. 

So, again, get a professional to do a test so that you have an objective view. Go through your GP if that makes things easier. 

Oh and...

If I'm here to criticize you I'd say the following; you're 20 and you're getting a kid? Are you mental? You cant even properly take care of yourself, how on earth will you take care of the kid?"
