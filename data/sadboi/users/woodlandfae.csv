As a few random tips, keep a clean water brush aside to help blend things out without adding more colour to a painting.

Use 2 cups of water to clean brushes while painting, clean in the first then second, so the second cup keeps fresher for longer :)

You’re only 24, there’s time to work out what you’d like to do get, but future you will thank you for any sort of ambition you use now! I took way too long to get off my arse to look for a career, I’m 26.

Reach a balance maybe?

Then there’s Papio Press who do simple drawings and patterns. Jessica Roux is someone who makes their ‘naive’ drawings look great. Another of my favourites.

Watch some videos on skillshare for free with the trial period! There’s lots of things you can do/create without having a huge skill level. It will still take practice, but it’s possible!!!!! And within reach!! 

Also don’t be afraid to ‘copy’ other artists as practice (if you post always give credit though obviously) Vincent Van Gogh and other ‘greats’ did this too :)"

It’s strange isn’t it? How fundamentally different we can be, how something insignificant to us can mean the world to them and vice versa...I guess they see all those kind of ‘small talk’ and ‘small interactions’ as a way of showing you care, kind of like ‘relationship maintenance’ :’))

I didn’t accept my sisters invite to some drinks one night and I could really tell it bothered her, I made the effort to arrange another time though...and even though to me it was mostly just small talk and some drinks...it meant a lot to her. She felt connected to me and it made her happy. Soooo...even though I find it draining sometimes, and I see her in other family outings and I know already I love her and get enough from family bonding etc, I know that ‘one on one time’ makes her feel like I really appreciate her. 

Sometimes people just want to feel loved. I think my flaw is that I can be a little tooooo self serving sometimes.....like I’m thoughtful yeah, but I can be distant, and I need to remember that can unsettle those close to me. So making the effort to just remember to send a message or something can really help :)"
infp,fkyl6fd,t3_fl9az0,1584650929.0,"Oh my gosh YES all my problems are with ESFJs!!!!!!
My sister and several bosses/supervisors at work..

As to why...well..from my experience the ESFJs I’ve known expect a lot more ‘presence’ 
We’re very daydreamy as a type and like to be in our own heads and often I think ESFJs find it a bit weird and plain antisocial...they take it as being snobbish and quite rude, they often see us as being very ‘un-peopley’ when they’re aaaaaaaall about the people! and about what’s happening NOW.

We really just rub each other up the wrong way...we see them as fake, they see us as selfish, we see them as small minded, they see us as unpractical 

For example my sister will be like “why do you always have to question everything!!?!??” And I’ll be like “why do you always just do/think what’s popular cause it’s popular!!?!?!!”

Opposites."
