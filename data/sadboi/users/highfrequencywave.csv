So say they agree to reasonable deductions, should I still attempt to claim back the full amount on the grounds that I could take them to court over the lack of deposit protection?"
narcissisticparents,f1neou1,t1_f1na7jg,1569615511.0,"It‚Äôs crazy how similar all our stories are, the one difference in mine is that my parents are still together but they really really shouldn‚Äôt be. They hardly spend time with each other and sleep in different rooms.

I tried confronting my parents with a written letter last year and explained everything. I put everything in there and poured my heart out. It didn‚Äôt blow up but instead it literally changed nothing. Just complete denial on their part. In some ways that just hurt more.

Ask yourself what you hope to achieve by confronting. It helped me because there was nothing more for me to do, so I finally let go of trying to improve my relationship with them, as difficult as that realisation was. Hope it goes okay"

veganfitness,ey67rnt,t1_ey66hw6,1566849338.0,"The reason your muscle growth will be slow with any type of weight training, is because you‚Äôre still physically growing, you‚Äôre only 16. 
You will still see muscle growth though, and also improvements in all areas of fitness (strength, endurance, power, agility, flexibility, stamina etc); some more quickly than others however, like flexibility takes ages to improve but endurance develops quickly.

Honestly though the biggest advice I‚Äôd tell my 16 year old self is just do the sports you find fun and the results will come, you‚Äôre only going to stick with it long term if you enjoy it"
