Not every drug is a good fit for every person though. It depends on the chemicals your body needs and doesn't need. For example I can't take SSRIs without extreme insomnia and muscle tightness, which I think is caused by too much serotonin. I need dopamine drugs like Wellbutrin and Abilify.

They make educated guesses at the hospital and send you out very quickly without seeing if the medications have good or bad side effects. That's my primary criticism of the psych hospital system in America. Maybe holding people a couple of weeks to see the effects of medications might be a better solution. 3-5 days is not enough.
