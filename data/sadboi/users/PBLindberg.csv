Second of all: Of course she can't say such a thing. I'm not sure which kind of mental issue you're dealing with, but I think it can hurt to hear someone saying that to you. Especially when she should be the one to help you. It saddens me to see how people handle mental health. If somebody is broken, the last thing he needs it to be shattered even more.

  
Report her and the guy who yelled at you.

All the strenth and blessings upon you, my friend. You can and you will get through this. Trust me."

Sometimes for creative reasons.

Sometimes for other reasons.

It's unfortunate that you have this kind of thoughts. I think I know how you feel.

First of all: You should not be ashamed of those thoughts. Instead, if you just possibly can, try to figure out the ""root"" of those thoughts.

Second of all: Don't try to actively ignore those thoughts or fight against them, because they will just grow in strength if you do that. I know this is hard in the beginning, but try to ignore them and focus on something else. Breathing, for example.

Hopefully, this helps. Even a little bit.

Be well, my friend!"
