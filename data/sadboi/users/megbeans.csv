Staying with her does guarantee you won‚Äôt have any biological kids. 

Are you not already a dad to her kids? I know not biologically but in all other ways? You need to think about how important it is for you to have a biological baby vs raising a child as if they were your own.

That‚Äôs perfect, is 11am the time of his morning meal and insulin dose? 

Every 30 mins is more than what‚Äôs needed but if you‚Äôre happy doing that then there‚Äôs no reason not to. Make sure to give the final curve to your vet to analyse! 

Okay so, the solution to the 4 cats and stealing food issue would probably be a microchip feeder or microchip cat flap into a box which contains the food. This way Baby can only eat his food when you give it to him (he wouldn‚Äôt need a feeder because you can just watch to ensure he eats) and the other cats who eat ad-lib can have their own feeders ie hyperthyroid cat has his own feeder/box so he can go in and out when he wants to graze, and the other 2 can share a feeder/box as they have no dietary requirements. Or you can just have the feeder/box programmed to allow all other 3 cats in except Baby. 

Controlled diabetes does not stay at a steady level. Think about it in simple terms, food = glucose rises. Insulin = glucose drops. So when Baby eats, the glucose rises, then when the insulin kicks in it starts dropping, until it reaches a low peak (we call this the nadir). It then begins to wear off and the blood glucose rises (all the time Baby is digesting food so getting a steady rate of glucose added by the gut). Then you feed and give insulin again and the curve starts again. 

[Scroll down to see the ‚Äúideal‚Äù glucose curve chart](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/vetchick.com/2016/11/monitoringdiabetes/amp/) 

It‚Äôs unlikely that hyPERglycaemia caused the seizures, especially if blood glucose was normal on arrival at the vet, although it is still entirely possible. Don‚Äôt look at the seizure in a too ‚Äúdisease focused‚Äù way, it could be completely unrelated to the diabetes.

There are some apps you can get which help you track and monitor your cats diabetes - clinical signs as well as blood glucose. This helps to give your vet and yourself a good understanding. The general rule nowadays is to base the insulin dose on clinical signs rather than lab results (although both must be taken into account). Search pet diabetes in the App Store and see what comes up. 

The [caninsulin website](http://www.caninsulin.co.uk/cats.aspx) is also a very informative resource although it‚Äôs only supposed to be for animals receiving that specific treatment, so if your cat isn‚Äôt receiving that brand, take any information about medication with a pinch of salt.

‚Ä¢it would probably be beneficial to do some light physiotherapy on the affected leg - petrissage and effleurage but I would avoid passive range of movement due to back pain. Monitor for pain and if for any reason the PT causes it stop and don‚Äôt try again. 

‚Ä¢It won‚Äôt cause any harm to occasionally check IOP of the remaining eye, especially if it previously was high. I‚Äôd probably do it once a year unless it is on the higher end of the reference range (then I would do it more frequently). I‚Äôm pretty sure ear infections don‚Äôt affect IOP as it‚Äôs more related to increased production and decreased drainage of aqueous humour. The only way it may affect it would be if the inflammation caused by the otitis caused the AH to not drain as it normally would.

AskVet,fn1idb2,t3_fya141,1586562644.0,"Diabetes can be difficult to understand and manage but once you get on top of things it‚Äôs so worth it. 

Firstly, I‚Äôm so glad you got the freestyle libre it will make it much easier to manage. 

Secondly (answer to your question), there is no such thing as normal. Different patients react to insulin in very different ways which is why it is so important that we monitor them. I don‚Äôt know if the freestyle libre automatically does this but if not, record the blood glucose throughout the day (every 1-2 hours) for 1 day. This is called a glucose curve, and helps the vet to decide on the correct dose of insulin as well as learn how your individual cat‚Äôs body responds to the insulin. 

Thirdly, just some advice on managing diabetes in cats, because you said you are new to this. Sorry if you already knew some of these

‚Ä¢ Try to keep the food identical. It should be 2 meals a day 12 hours apart, at the same time as, or 30 minutes before the insulin. Ideally a low carb diet, if dry food - weigh it so the amount is identical every time. No treats. There are specific diabetes diets for cats but these are expensive so it depends on your budget. 

‚Ä¢ Seems a silly one but make sure the insulin is kept in the fridge (if it‚Äôs supposed to be. Most insulin preparations are inactivated if not kept in the fridge)

‚Ä¢Try and keep exercise the same too, this is easier in dogs than cats but mainly either avoid playing lots or play the same amount every day 

‚Ä¢ Make sure you are confident on how to inject, if insulin is administered wrongly or only half the dose is administered this can have a massive effect. Similarly, if you feel your cat didn‚Äôt receive the whole dose, do not guess how much they missed, contact your vet and ask them what to do. The freestyle libre reading will help them to decide. 

‚Ä¢Keep yourself safe from the needles! Never re-cap a needle, just use it once and then dispose of it in a sharps bin. 

‚Ä¢Cats can have increased sugar levels from being stressed, you may notice an abnormality on the readings which could be as a result of this. 

‚Ä¢Know the signs of diabetic complications
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar): Depression, drinking more, continuous hunger
Hypoglycaemia (not enough sugar): seizures, apparent blindness, lack of coordination, loss of appetite, lethargy, unusual behaviour
Diabetic Ketoacidosis (big complication): Vomiting, loss of appetite, collapse, diarrhoea, breath which smells of pear drops, slow deep breathing.

The drugs we use for general Anaesthesia in cats and dogs are the same as the ones used in humans and have the exact same effect - so the cats fall asleep and then wake up somewhere else super confused. 

Also when we do surgeries we always give pain relief before it starts anyway - this is because it is easier to prevent pain in this way than it is to give it once the painful stimulus has started. Also, it gives the drug time to take full effect before they are awake enough to feel the pain. 

The only drug used that can cause paralysis but they‚Äôre still awake is something called an NMBA (Neuromuscular Blocking Agent). These block the pathways from the brain to the muscles meaning the patient is awake but cannot move. 

These are not generally used in animal practice, and if they are, they are used alongside a strong sedative and pain relief so the animal never suffers. 

Throughout the anaesthetic the animals are
Monitored for reflexes, and vitals are taken every 5 minutes. This not only tells us how asleep they are, but also alerts us to whether or not they are feeling pain, we then adjust medications accordingly."

Carole Baskins ‚Äúrescue‚Äù is no better but housing a bunch of obese tigers in an unenriched cage together and feeding them leftovers of out of date food collections, breeding the big cats and then immediately stealing their cubs to make them like humans does not equal happy animals. 


Animals have 5 basic needs:

‚Ä¢A suitable diet: NOPE this need is not met. Yes they feed with cows but also out of date food from a collection. Not exactly the nutritional balance they need. 

‚Ä¢A suitable environment: NOPE - huge enclosures yes, but enrichment. They‚Äôre bland and empty. They don‚Äôt have high places to climb 

‚Ä¢Prevention of pain and suffering: Pain- this need is met. Suffering - depends if you consider the emotional suffering the mother tiger goes through, or the distress they would feel when they hear him blowing things up. 

‚Ä¢Housed with/or without companions: Technically met although in the wild tigers wouldn‚Äôt be in such large groups so close together especially with such competition for food when they started running out of money 

‚Ä¢Expression of normal behaviour: NOPE. None of what those animals get to do is normal behaviour. Mothers can‚Äôt look after their cubs, they don‚Äôt hunt or even simulate hunting. They get posed next to people who want to look good."

I still stick by the fact your DLA is supposed to be spent on maintaining you/your disability which can include transport to doctor/hospital, extra support in the home, modifications to make life easier for you.
