My mom’s big sexy treat was to catch me touching myself when I thought I was alone, in the middle of the night or whatever. She’d squirm, and just *glow* with sexual mischief while recounting her little peep sesh to me in the morning, dragging her words out with this throaty, moaning tone. 

In my NDad’s emotional dumping sessions, he heavily implied to my sister and me that my mom did not have sex with him, and the idiot never seemed to put 2 and 2 together that she was more turned on by little girls than him. He threw us to the dogs and never once intervened in my mom’s “*Mommie Dearest* meets sexual abuse” style of mothering because he was so busy feeling sorry for himself as the true victim."

I also had a boyfriend be the one to tell me about tampons at age 22, as my mom hadn’t allowed me to use them and it no longer even occurred to me that I *could*.

I dreaded telling my mom I had started my period at 13 because I knew she’d make a meal of my feelings. I kept as calm and stoic as possible, but she still picked up the phone immediately and recounted it to one of my aunts, laughing and mimicking me as if I had cried and freaked out hysterically when I hadn’t at all."

Meditation sessions from YouTube for toxic shame and inner child healing type stuff is helping, too.

Her decision to work for Elena so she can hover and spy on Pearl as if she’s being a disloyal daughter just for making friends with the Richardson kids was particularly disgusting to me. 

One of my closest friends had her life broken by a nomadic mother almost exactly like Mia- always on the run, telling her daughter that no one is truly looking out for her, no one is her true friend, and treating her like an intimate partner in lieu of age-appropriate relationships.

He’d blow the fuck up at the thought of us listening to music that might have “cussing” in it, and controlled every micro-aspect of our lives, but would play innocent/helpless when it came to my Mom’s Joan Crawford antics and sexual obsession with us. BPD/Narc parenting is such fucking soul rape."

None of us saw the connection, because the sexual abuse from my mom was just sort of woven into everyday life. 

Lascivious and harassing comments about our developing bodies, mini assaults on me where she’s pin me and suck my earlobes while moaning and grinding on me, and a very sexually possessive anger and watchfulness over my sister and I to the extent of not allowing us to see a gyno or use tampons.

Matt Weiner is brilliant, but it seems like he ceded to younger writers after that perfect first season. 

The Sopranos feels profound in a super *earned* way. Winter and Chase and their team wrote from such a gut level."
CPTSD,f9z8i1w,t1_f9z1hd7,1575739473.0,"The real twist is that my Dad hates it when I’m good at something he’s not good at. It’s like my job was supposed to be “less than”-  if I couldn’t validate him by being exactly the same. His self-esteem completely unravels when I appear to be succeeding at something, and he will tear it down while appearing to act “supportive”.

Pulling me up with one hand and punching me with the other is how I would describe his parenting. 

My therapist thinks he is just a codependent and wants to be a “rescuer” , but he genuinely puffs up with excitement when I fail or am depressed because it justifies his low opinion of me so he doesn’t have to feel guilty about being a father who secretly hates and competes with his child."

My Dad is white, married to my Hispanic mom, and he thinks this absolves him of racial sensitivity, and it’s like he only recently realized that I am part Hispanic, it’s weird, it’s like my mom’s lineage wasn’t quite legitimate to him. He was also an extreme narcissistic control freak who hates that I differ from him. 

If he could delete, extinguish, and erase everything that makes me *me*, and create a walking zombie of himself, he would cry tears of joy. He wouldn’t even miss me."
raisedbynarcissists,f9u398d,t3_e6suk4,1575643574.0,"Thank you for this, OP. The intense news cycle and political climate has just been another way for my NDad to continue his covert campaign that it is not OK for me to be different  from him in any way, and to also try to bait me into circular, illogical arguments.

It’s nice to hear him gear up for a targeted monologue out of nowhere: “Hey, les_incompetents, DIDJA HEAR ABOUT _______. ???!! HOW ARE THEY GONNA FUND THAT??? THESE ______S DON’T UNDERSTAND HOW THINGS WORK, BLAH BLAH”

....and then knock the wind out of his sails by saying “I must have missed that”, and change the subject.

On a positive note, I think the current political situation has brought the topic of narcissism into full, glaring view on a mass scale for the first time, spawning so many informative articles and such that have helped me and hopefully others finally put a name to the long-form emotional abuse they’ve experienced, so, we’ve got that going for us, which is nice 💁🏻‍♀️"

We’re just offshoots of him, and he hates himself, therefore we *deserve* the decades-long smear campaigns, the criticism, control, emotional abandonment, and scapegoating. Our reactive depression and anger only make us bigger pieces of shit to him, and the cycle continues. He will never be “caught” because he’s been honing his act all his life."

She didn’t teach my sister and I to be women, or take care of ourselves because she wanted us to stay helpless. Womanhood was like a special secret club we weren’t good enough to be initiated into. 

Learning to use tampons at age 22, and teaching myself to put my hair in a bun at age 37 have been among my victories of femininity!"

He would also randomly accuse me of lying when I was telling the truth, like it was this hilarious game. 

Both parents would read my journals (until I created a set of hieroglyphics to write in!), and invade my body or belongings any time they felt bored or needy, so yeah, I get a feeling of danger from certain kinds of vulnerability and true, real intimacy seems impossible and gross."

I also had no boundaries, because this was never modeled or allowed. 

I’m still learning to adjust to situations and conversations that seem “dry”. NDad would constantly dump all this forced emotional intimacy on me, followed by lovebombing, or making examples of everyone by shit-talking them to death and telling me their private business told to him in confidence. 

I feel ruined for normal life sometimes because I’m bored with everyone and everything because my bar for N-drama was raised impossibly high."

It’s classic cover-my-ass “damage control” to make herself seem calm, loving, and reasonable- like she’s waiting out a storm (you, the “challenge”—for being a person instead of a puppet).

He can’t do anything “off-script”, so his “questions” (aka criticisms with a question mark at the end that he doesn’t give a shit about the actual answer to) and random prompts are always the same. 

He knows I’ll snap at him and hurt his ego if he criticizes me openly now that I’m an adult, so he’ll do it by proxy- he’ll lay into a public figure or friend he thinks is showing certain undesirable traits or political views he thinks I share, and use them as a piñata, hoping I’ll feel the sting."
