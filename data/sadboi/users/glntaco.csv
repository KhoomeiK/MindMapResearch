I know I need therapy to talk to someone but my brain has tucked that horror deep into some corner of my mind itâ€™s terrifying to think of sharing with someone. I wish I could understand why the only way for me to get better includes the pain of talking through what happened to me. And the pain and guilt of telling a loved one what I went through. I feel guilty at the thought of someone being worried about me. The thought of my parents or friends knowing how many demons I fight and the thought of them scared of something happening to me. I just wish I never knew the darkness that surrounds me."
