Ok here is another idea. What just for week you tried out “silly reasons to live” see what feels good, what feels cheesy what feels boring and what’s bad? 
I’m going to be on the road for a while but get back to me about how you feel about the idea :)"

SuicideWatch,fbzvckh,t3_ef6qpu,1577263560.0,"become an asshole and distant yourself from people. Or you could have a “freak” accident so that people don’t feel guilty about your suicide. 

I’ve actually done the the opposite so I don’t kill my self haha... make sure to keep myself close to my family and have a loved one and caring friends. but I get you I’ve done one on one therapy before and I never really felt like it worked. Group therapy was a bit better, it gave me perspective on how others feel and different perspectives about others. I might look into it again. 

However in the meantime, I’m doing more self-help book reading. it’s been helping a little, but I’m still trying to figure out how to have a healthy balance. I just don’t want to have the urge to kill myself anymore.  

I’m sorry life has become so unbearable. I hope you can find other means to relive your stress beyond suicide."

animationcareer,fbx12nq,t3_eenjtk,1577165343.0,"I sorta stumbled upon it. I always have had an appreciation for animation growing up. Watched every Pixar movie, all the Disney movies I could get my hands on, cartoons on Disney , nicktoons and Cartoon Network. After I had found myself “too cool for kid animation” I got myself hooked on anime. but I never really thought it be possible to work in that industry, felt a bit removed and I never thought about it to begin with. Plus growing up many of my family members were “starving artists” and I thought going into art meant you would have no money.

However, In high school I really got into fine art and graphic design. I took an art class every single semester and I decided to also take graphic design classes my Junior year. I really enjoyed having a large amount of different mediums to create illustrations with, and honestly had fun creating art both digitally and traditionally. When I graduated in high school I actually got a graphic design scholarship awarded to me. So then I thought, maybe I can give graphic design a try. 

long story short I did a graphic design internship and I wasn’t too into it. It was interesting but I felt like I was wanting to do something else. Felt like I wanted something more. 
So then I went to a community college for associates in art, ya know the basic gen eds. And after I graduated I was like, hun what do I do now?
I realized while I was in college that I really really hated to write academic papers. I was always doodling and wish I had taken fine art classes. so I thought ok, I’ll give graphic design a chance again. I look for schools in my area that had the program and while I was researching I had stumbled upon a different more interesting program.... 
it was an animation degree, and I watch the program example art and thought to myself “I could do better”. I went to the school for a tour and the classes they had were all super interesting and way up my alley. So I was like man I’m gonna be in school for another 4 years but while I’m at it I’m going become a great animator.

I actually just finished my first semester at my college and created an simple animation. I’ll be taking animation I next... I’m so excited and nervous.  But yeah that’s my story, wish me luck"

bipolar,fb6yyc5,t3_ebou1n,1576565829.0,"I’ve been very fortunate in that my disorder doesn’t effect my academics to the point that I have failed/dropped out of classes. I have learned a strong work ethic when I was in community college and my parents have been very supportive in my education. However I have transferred colleges 2 times due to stress. 

A couple things I have done to pass classes:

-Do all my homework

-check teachers ratings online to see how what you need to do to pass the class

-show up to all of classes. Even if I sleep in, I get up and get my ass to class (I’ve had friends fail classes because they never showed up for them)

-make friends who are in your the class. It’s good to have a person you can notes from if u miss a class

-I never sign up for more then 15 credits. Honestly I recommend 12 if you can. You might have to college longer but then you can devote more time to studying and relaxing( and dealing with yourself lol)

-do the readings!!! you will be way more engaged in the class

-speak up in class and ask questions when you can 

That’s all I can think of, if you have any more questions let me know!"

Also I think some Tra’s also really push gender stereotypes on people. To the point that people will become non-binary(and then you just set yourself to be oppressed 24/7).  Like it’s alright to decide what gender you want to be... you should at least decide which one you want to identify with more. I like being a women so I chose to be one(I stayed cis). My cousin didn’t like being a man and felt like a women so she chose to transition.

But I had a friend who was a women and decided to be non-binary. They were constantly complaining about themselves and seemed really confused about who they were as a person. They always had drama and seemed like they were a person who wanted to be oppressed. Always making themselves the victim.

I felt like they wanted to be a man, as they presented themselves as one and dressed as one, but then they would just wear a dress and be a “women” one day. It was very confusing to me. I just couldn’t understand why they couldn’t just be a Tomboy or like a man who liked to dressed in drag..."

Anyways, For me, it feels like your time perception sense is removed from your being. 
Unless I actively look at a clock I have no idea how much time has past. Everything just feels enteral and so slow. Sometimes it feels like I’m in hell and satan is touturing me by placing me in a sensory hellish scape.

Another thing is it feels like you have headphones placed on you that distort your sense of hearing too. For example words become chopped up, people talk extremely slow. Then paranoia ensues . everyone is whispering about you or you don’t exist, no one cares about you. 

honestly I’m not even sure if i qualify for dr/dp, bpd or bipolar....I just know I’m mentally fucked in the head and that drugs don’t work on me (anti-depression medicine made me manic), my moods are extremely inappropriate and out of my control at times. 🙃"

Epstein,f6eoae8,t1_f6ell66,1572806257.0,Yeah that’s the frustrating part is how do we revolution our nation without putting our own stability on the line. That’s the biggest question and I’m not sure how to answer it.
Epstein,f6ekkdk,t1_f6ejef7,1572805115.0,"Trauma is never 100% avoidable. Pedophiles make the active choice to go after young children and then repeat the cycle of trauma. yes we should make it easier to help thoses with trauma, but we should not excuse them from their choices. Everyone has a free will. People who use their free will to harm others in such a traumatic way should be locked up and punished."
