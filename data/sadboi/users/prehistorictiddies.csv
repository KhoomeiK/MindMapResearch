ClinicalPsychology,f7y746i,t3_dxvo5p,1574088265.0,"anyone can experience psychosis (brief psychotic disorder) but it will usually remit on its own and was prob caused by intense stress. schizophrenia needs to have symptoms present for at least 6 months otherwise it stays schizophreniform (1-5 months of symptoms). however by definition, schizophrenia involves psychosis (it‚Äôs a psychotic disorder) so you could never have schizophrenia without experiencing psychosis.

anyway, for schizophrenia to develop it‚Äôs not so much of a presence of one gene, like either you have X or you don‚Äôt have X. it‚Äôs much more of having a lot of certain genes, A, B, C, X, and so on, and which of them are turned on. so basically, you not only need to have a specific combination of genes, but those genes need to be turned on in a certain way, AND your environment has to interact with those turned on genes in a certain way. that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs pretty rare.

BPD,f7geb4n,t1_f7fzu9r,1573701490.0,"honestly feeling the absolute worst i‚Äôve ever felt. like just feeling so ashamed of my behavior. i‚Äôve actually learned in grad school that the feeling of shame is the experience of feeling out of control, which now makes total sense. the better handle i have on my life, the better i feel.

for me personally, i‚Äôve just accepted and then enacted certain changes like for example i need a very structural life. i have to sleep at a certain time, eat a certain way, take my meds, have time with friends, etc. i really like structure. of course life is chaotic and that can‚Äôt always work out but i really try to. also, i rarely will drink. even tho drinking was never a real issue for me it was way more stimulant drugs, drinking will totally dysregulate me the days following.

also, this is like very specific to me but having professional training in the psychological field helps me A LOT, education in my opinion is a way to end suffering. so my advice for anyone is to always read read read and become familiar with how you feel and what your experience is.

AND MOST IMPORTANT NEVER GIVE UP NEVER EVER EVER. help exists even when it‚Äôs truly hard to find and have access to. our brains are capable of change, neuroplasticity is REAL."

AskReddit,f5tdt2n,t3_dp56ya,1572456375.0,"it was a college professor of mine, he taught abnormal psychology. i was already a psychology major, but he really just changed my view of the field and truly inspired me.

he was a great and passionate professor the entire  year, but on the last day of class he gave an amazing speech. mind you this was at a huge university with a lecture hall of like 300 students. 

he said, ‚Äúif you leave this class forgetting everything we‚Äôve learned and studied, i don‚Äôt care. as long as you remember these three things:
1. mental illness is not a myth
2. everyone can, and some point will be, ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù 
3. as sigmund freud said, remember that everyone can love, and everyone can work.

everyone clapped and cheered, some even cried (me)"
