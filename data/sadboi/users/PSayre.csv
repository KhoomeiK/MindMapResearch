raisedbyborderlines,f7jb0zt,t3_dwbkdd,1573773941.0,"Wow, this is really spot on, my mother behaves exactly like this. It’s like she doesn’t see the difference between her and other people; she desires something about the tragic quality of a situation or the status of victimhood, and thus it now belongs to her. Anything bad that happens is about her and how she feels, any tragic story is automatically hers to share simply because she’s had some emotion about it.  I can’t count how many times during my childhood she’d haul out some private event from my life and just casually share it with whoever was listening.  Your comment about not being able to articulate why it’s so gross is really familiar as well. I knew I hated it when she’d  harp on someone else’s sad story, and it felt rude and unsafe when she did it to me, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on why. 

I’m still in contact with her parents (my grandparents) who don’t really grasp the quality of my non-relationship with my mother. Since we’ve been NC, she’s joined some deeply PD “writers group” and had a short story included in their annual self-published chapbook, which my grandparents wanted me to read because they’re sweet old people. 

Not only did the story center heavily on a personal tragedy, it also implied that the (heavily autobiographical) main character had a direct and personal connection with the events of 9/11. In fact, this tragedy was SO great that this narrator dissolved into a heap of pure waify cataclysm. In the final paragraphs, she turned around the reasoning i gave her for NC and turned it into part of this waif-wank of short fiction: “I cut off my eldest daughter for her own safety.”
 
Frankly, if i ever lost track of the reasons why she’s not welcome in my life, I would just have to recall that one sentence in that ridiculous story and it would be all the reason in the world."
occult,f5qw7ig,t3_dou3hq,1572384027.0,"The middle two symbols look alchemical: the cuplike one is similar to the alchemical symbol for white arsenic, or possibly antimony. Crosses, in alchemy, usually represent physicality, usually described as “the cross of matter”.

Additionally, “the emerald tablet” is an important alchemical document also associated with a mercury-type historical figure (hermes trismegistus)

Try looking at instructions for tying a tichel (traditional jewish women’s head covering) for some visual prompts if you need more help.

There are cheap, simple ways to really blend your wig with your scalp and hairline and make it look extremely realistic that you can learn just by spending a bit of time watching these tutorials.

4.) Synthetic hair is cheaper but will not last more than a few wears. Human hair is an excellent investment. I still have my first human hair wig, a short bob with bangs, that i bought over 2 years ago. I found it on dresslily for under $50. I’ve gone through loads of synthetic wigs in the meantime.

OCPoetry,f1g3t95,t3_d9buzh,1569459303.0,"I really like the concept of this, and the wordplay between write and writhe, especially in the second stanza with ""I writ(he) about you"". That's an excellent image.

&#x200B;

I think you need some more concrete imagery in this poem, as it falls flat in a few places. Phrases like ""at wits end"" and ""truths no one's ever cared to hear"" are, frankly, very boring. As a reader, my eyes just glide over them and they really don't inspire any thought or feeling in me.  I'd like to see at least one strong image per line.

&#x200B;

I also want to point out your end words. The rhythm of the stanza is important, yes, but the last word in each line should really burn bright for your reader and guide them to the next one. You have some nice ones, ""universe"" ""sky"" ""volumes"" but even these could be made stronger. The rest are really falling flat for me. 

&#x200B;

Lastly, your overall metaphor could be tightened up a lot. You're doing something great with this connection between writing and physical connection/intimacy. But what are ""invisible shackles"" doing in this poem that is so much about writing, sex, and the night sky? Why is the subject leaving a ""wake""  in the last line when there has been no water imagery to speak of  in the piece?  


&#x200B;

Poems about poetry are really hard, because poetry is a large and not-concrete-at-all idea. You've definitely started the work of making it more so--   I think you have an extremely solid idea here. Really lean into your imagery and don't rest on common turns of phrase.  This is nice, but I'm positive it could be a lot better-- keep going with this idea."

axolotl,et80yvr,t3_cadenb,1562543486.0,"If you didn’t cycle your tank before putting your axie in it, ammonia can very quickly become dangerous— a matter of hours.


If this is the case, you should get a test kit right away—tonight—and start testing at least once every day. Read up on the nitrogen cycle and understand what you need to be looking for in the testing.


I made this mistake with my axolotl and it is possible to cycle the tank with your axie in it but it is a lot of babysitting the tank like a mother hen for several weeks.  What i did:



20% water changes twice a day as long as ammonia was above .25 ppm. You need SOME ammonia to start the cycle but it needs to stay very low.
Get some plants for the aquarium. They help control ammonia and nitrite levels. Moss balls  and hornwort are easy to grow in low light which axies need. 


Be extremely fastidious about cleaning poop and uneaten food out of the tank immediately. Pick up the decor and make sure nothing is underneath it or stuck to it. Rotting food and feces is where ammonia comes from. Watch also for dead plant bits and remove them carefully as well.


Mopani wood as decor will leach tannins into your water and turn it brown, but it will also lower the pH of your water which helps ammonia remain in a slightly less toxic form. 


I was able to cycle a 10gal with a baby axie in it by doing this for about 6 weeks. I don’t recommend it—it’s a huge pain in the ass—but you gotta cycle the tank somehow and now the animal is in there. 



Your other option is removing the axie and putting him in a plastic tub while you cycle the tank separately. Look up “fishless tank cycling” for info. You must change the water in the tub 100% every single day.  You also have to have an air stone or something to oxygenate the water. 

Good luck and start reading up and testing right away!"
