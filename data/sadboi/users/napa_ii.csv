SuicideWatch,fe03zef,t1_fcqr6nb,1578802502.0,"I’ve never attempted but I’ve been depressed for as long as I can remember. My life isn’t even that bad, i even have a decent family (not perfect but ok). It’s comforting to know there’s other people out there who feel the same as I do. I’ve just never felt right. I’ve thought about killing myself but don’t have the courage to do something like that (maybe my pain isn’t bad enough yet?).....pretty typical thought amongst us I guess"
