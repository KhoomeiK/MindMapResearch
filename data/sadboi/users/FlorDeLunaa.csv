clearly she lacks alot of self confidence... i hate to chuck things off to crazy but shes CLEARLY there... 

lets face it, lots of times girls dont behave as they should and support one another as sisters and equals... so we make friends with men who are happy to be in our company, hold conversation and often avoid sharing judgement like the plague. dont let anyone judge you for not wanting a plethora of female friends i say... if you're lucky you'll find a female friend down the line that isn't jelous of your personality and instead celebrates you and your wins ... keep on keepin on natural beauty. screw that crazy girl and the friends that enable her psychotic behavior."

but anyways... a little psychology since what you want is to be a more interesting/exciting person to other people... 

other people  mostly just want to talk about themselves... they may seem like they are interested   in one another, in differences and in what each others hobbies are... but really we are all simply looking for similarities, you see people are much more narcissistic than they let on to be .. often more than they themselves even realize! 

i suspect you are plenty interesting, cozy to watch things and get lost on reddit with! even if you yourself aren't too certain today on what y o u find most interesting about yourself.. its there! 

so for now, if you simply would like to feel more like better company at work in the opinion of your coworkers...

 as i know how much it can and in the long run sting to feel like ""the boring one"" ... i used to be the ""sad one"" then i started listening in instead of quietly self loathing or verbalizing my turmoil 

 even when no one was talking to me... i would listen, look and learn all i could about someone elses interest- then use them to strike conversation or simply compliment them.. agree with them in a way that was ""close to home"" so to speak... people R e a l l y like themselves... so remind them of themselves and you become memorable in SUCH a pleasant way .. for all kinds of people!  i hope this helps <3"
