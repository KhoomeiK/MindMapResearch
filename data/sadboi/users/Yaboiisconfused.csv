OkCupid,f9vvg7a,t1_f9vv0mw,1575680831.0,"I didn't know that they were that similar. I mean, I figured they were both a little identical mechanical wise, but not down almost being the same thing. But I guess since Tinder is mainly used for hookups, and Okcupid is more about finding a relationship, I'll just stay on there. Thanks for your input"
OkCupid,f9vlznb,t1_f9vlokr,1575673748.0,"Lol yeah I can't lie, my profile is kind of boring. But that advice does sound pretty useful. I guess I'll go update mine. Thanks for the advice"
OkCupid,f9vk4ld,t1_f9vjf30,1575672431.0,"So basically, I've been approaching online dating wrong?"
dating_advice,f8xnv1b,t1_f8xn9np,1574925674.0,"Lol I did. And if you want, don't be afraid to PM me as well. I wouldn't mind it"
dating_advice,f8xmt9i,t1_f8xmkhl,1574924398.0,It's fine lol. I'm happy you got some help out of the thread. Have a good night :)
dating_advice,f8xltkl,t1_f8xlmfu,1574923241.0,"Lol I have no idea. Whenever someone says or seema like they need help, I do my best to help them as well. And since it was something I'm familiar with, I figured I should give a little help lol"
dating_advice,f8xkgrb,t1_f8xixh1,1574921819.0,"Ik, I've been rejected a lot (and I'm not talking about people who I've grown feelings for, I'm talking about from people in general) but another piece of advice I'll give you, is music. Play a peaceful, or upbeat song in your head when you feel anxious. Something that'll make you calm of happy. Don't think of a song that has a lot of feeling attached to it (like a memory that could make you feel upset or anxious etc.) Or anything loud and aggressive. It'll help you out a lot. I've been dealing with anxiety for years"
dating_advice,f8xhzom,t1_f8xh147,1574919387.0,"I'll admit, when I am out by myself I do feel uncomfortable at first, till I get used to the area, or who I'm around. I grew up as a socially awkward kid, and never did feel like I fit in. I think the best thing to do, is to think of something comforting. Like scenery that makes you feel happy works for me or think you're in your own movie if that makes sense"
dating_advice,f8xhs68,t1_f8xgaax,1574919193.0,"Alright, thank you so much for you help :)"
dating_advice,f8xfycf,t1_f8xem9y,1574917582.0,"Okay, I can keep that in mind. I gotta get out there and learn to communicate with people and build relationships for the future anyways, so I might as well start now"

dating_advice,f8xc8qo,t1_f8xb88r,1574914341.0,"That's kind of the same problem I'm in. I completely forgot how to meet people and anxiety issues as well, and that's the biggest part I'm having issues facing"
dating_advice,f8xaput,t1_f8x8ilo,1574913039.0,"I might have to try that. I don't have many friends and that's kind of what I'm also looking for, and my ability to even get out is pretty low"

relationship_advice,f5rak76,t3_douy1q,1572391029.0,"Bro that's straight up FUCKED. I sounds really rational to leave her. Not just because she cheated on you, but because she FUCKED HER COUSIN! There's no way of working that out. If your parnter doesn't like you going though their phone, there's something wrong (not that you should go though people's privacy, but if they already don't like it before you do it, something is up) and you moved just to ve with her, and she cheated on you. Do yourself a favor, and move on. You deserve a hell of a lot better than that mess"
