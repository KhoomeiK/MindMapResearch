emotionalabuse,fqob5wf,t3_gjz0ru,1589511369.0,"I think this is an admirable and very courageous idea, but to be honest I am concerned about your safety, especially if you are currently in an area where lockdown/ stay-at-home orders are still in effect for coronavirus. If there‚Äôs even a possibility that things could turn physical/ you could be kicked out of your house I personally am leaning towards advising you not to risk it at the moment, just for your own safety. Once you are living elsewhere/ in a safe environment away from her I think it could be a safer time. But of course, you know your situation best, and ultimately the choice is yours. 

Unfortunately, in my experiences of abuse, I‚Äôve found that it is very difficult for abusers to change/ realize that they have been abusive. It may take years of therapy or something for her to truly realize the harm she has done, and I worry that showing her articles may just be extra emotional labor/ effort on your part but may not get through to her- through no fault of yours, of course.  

If you are planning to confront her, do you have a concrete back-up plan for a new, safe place to live, or a support system/ friends/ anyone who can help you out in case your mom responds badly?"

At some point I grew to realize that almost every relationship (friends, family) I have is somewhat abusive or I have to lie or hide who I truly am in it to some extent or another. The more I cut out the toxic people, the fewer people I am left with, so in terms of social support, I genuinely have no one. Thankfully I‚Äôm in therapy at least via video call for the slightest sliver of sanity it provides me lmao. 

It‚Äôs so hard to keep going when the suffering feels so endless. I guess one thing that helps is knowing that if anything, there are a lot of possibilities out there. In the future I can leave my parents‚Äô stupid house for good, get my own apartment... it‚Äôs nice to visualize about imagined comforting scenarios that I hope will happen in the future. Maybe I can finally meet some good and healthy people. Or sometimes I look to the past and try to grab the smallest thing I think is worthwhile even if it‚Äôs not much. Maybe it‚Äôs my cousins‚Äô smiling faces. Maybe it‚Äôs the bunny I got to pet one time in my life. Maybe it‚Äôs the sandwich I got to eat today. 

The easiest thing for me to do in a crisis is just take it one small step at a time. ‚ÄúI am going to drink this glass of water. I then am going to walk upstairs. I then am going to lie down and try to sleep.‚Äù Having a small, immediate goal in front of me can make it feel easier when I break down and just want to do nothing. 

If it helps just know that this community is overall a nice community full of many supportive people, who can hopefully also support you even if just to the slightest extent.

In terms of the immediate future, I‚Äôm planning to go and stay with my aunt for at least a couple of days. She and my uncle have NO idea about the abuse and seem like nice/ good enough people, but i unfortunately live in a culture where child abuse is basically forgiven or even enabled and people are told to just respect their elders because ‚Äúparents always know best‚Äù and stuff. Also my brother despite being literally the most abusive piece of shit I know has always been portrayed to them in a sympathetic light by my parents. I can‚Äôt bear the thought of disclosing anything to them just to have them not believe me.

CPTSD,fo5zfkw,t3_g5v49q,1587540867.0,"I‚Äôm actually writing a literature review on 
PTSD and sleep disturbances for my neuro class! Some of the explanations you brainstormed were actually mentioned in my research. 

One of my sources suggested that sleep is an ‚Äúinherently contradictory experience to vigilance‚Äù because we make ourselves vulnerable by sleeping, whereas hyper-vigilance would prompt us to try and be on our guard as much as possible. 

Another source pointed out how with people with, for example, insomnia usually desire sleep but are unable to sleep. Whereas PTSD patients are often afraid or avoidant of sleep. In a particular study, fear of sleep in PTSD patients was associated with more frequent nightmares, reduced total sleep time, and more disruptive sleep behaviors. 

I imagine this could quickly result in a vicious cycle where fear of sleeping due to nightmares/ hypervigilance could lead to poor quality of sleep and increased nightmares, leading the fear/ avoidance of sleep to increase more, etc.
