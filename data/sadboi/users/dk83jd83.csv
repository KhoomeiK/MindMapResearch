1. Learn to love yourself. This is important because once your brain is programmed to see yourself in a negative light, it doesn't really matter how attractive or unattractive you are—you will always manage to find flaws in yourself and hate yourself and feel miserable. In fact, many people with body image problems are not as ugly as they think they are; the fundamental problem is that their brains see a distorted image of their own body. Reprogramming one's brain and learning to love oneself again is no easy feat, and it often requires professional help, but it is definitely worth it. 

2. Work on improving yourself. For example, lose weight, exercise, etc."

Yes, many people worry that taking antidepressants will make them ""less like themselves"". But SSRIs do not make people behave abnormally; in fact, patients who get better on SSRIs usually say that they feel *more* normal or more like themselves. Try to be patient: It isn't unusual to experience only brief intermittent periods of improvement at first. With time, good days turn into good weeks, good weeks into good months, and so on until you reach a sufficiently stable state of well-being.

In my opinion, the most important thing is to find the right SSRI and the right dose for you. If you find one that works, you're likely to continue to feel well for as long as you take it. In fact, many patients say that the longer they take the SSRI, the better they feel.

The SSRI doses needed to treat mental illness vary for different people. Just because you have a low body weight doesn't mean that a low dose will be enough. The truth is that there is no way to predict ahead of time which dose will be best for you. The only way to know is to try them. So if you're taking a lower dose and it's not working well, it makes sense to take a higher dose and see if that works better.

When increasing your dose, keep this in mind: the higher the dose, the more likely you are to experience side effects. This can obviously limit how high you can go. By all means try to reach the recommended maximum of 200 mg, but if you begin to experience side effects that you can't tolerate, use instead the highest dose that you *can* tolerate. Also, SSRIs can interact adversely when taken in conjunction with other drugs—if this is the case, make sure to check with your doctor."
SuicideWatch,euedf12,t1_eudassz,1563741589.0,"I totally agree on that one. But the fact that SSRIs take so long to take effect is actually a good thing. If they provided instant relief they would be highly addictive—like opioids. Because SSRIs do not cause addiction, one can take them for many years, or even for life, without any problems. SSRIs are nothing to be afraid of; they tend to be very safe. Initially there can be some side effects, but they usually disappear on their own with the passage of time.

Another important consideration is that you need to be taking a high enough dose for the medication to work. If you're seeing little or no improvement, it may be because your dose is too low. So don’t give up before trying a high enough dose for a long enough time. If possible, try reaching the maximum recommended dose (which is typically 200 mg per day for Zoloft) for at least 3 weeks; if you don't improve after that, you may safely conclude that the SSRI is ineffective and switch to another one."

SuicideWatch,eubdhvx,t3_cfm1uf,1563645517.0,"What is a bad person? To me, a bad person is someone who hurts people. Conversely, a good person is someone who doesn't hurt people, or, even better, someone who repairs the damage done by others.

You believe you're a bad person? I tell you, I tell you that those who insult and bully you because of your appearance, are ten thousand times more evil. *They* are the cardinal cause of your illness. And evil things are made to be avoided. So if there are any bullies in your life right now, get as far away from them as you can.

Why do you think you're a bad person? In what way are you hurting others? You may argue that since there are people who dislike you, your mere existence hurts them, and this makes you a bad person. But this is easily solved by just getting away from them. Get away from those who dislike you, draw close to those who do like you. And if you think that *everyone* dislikes you, that's certainly false. Just as it is impossible to be liked by everyone, it is also impossible to be disliked by everyone.

So there, you're a good person to me. And you're a good person, at the very least, to the vast majority of people. Do you want to be even better? Work on yourself. Work on repairing the damage others have done to you. Don't be mistaken, you're the victim here, not the criminal. The reason why you are in this situation is largely because of what has been done to you, not because of any choice you've made. Very few people have suffered as much as you have. Fixing all the damage will likely take many, many years, but eventually it will all be gone. There will come a time when you won't even remember that you used to hurt so much.
