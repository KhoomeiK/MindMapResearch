bipolar2,fdgvcko,t1_fdgdr75,1578409245.0,"I thought I was the only one whose family denied the diagnosis! One of my closest friends told me that her sister and father are bipolar and I am no way as bad as them so there's no way I could be. I thought but you don't know what goes on in here!
Her family doesn't really believe in therapy so there's that.  Since then we just never discuss it. She was also not a fan of some of my other life choices but that's neither here nor there, she is supportive regardless of her opinions so it's all good."
