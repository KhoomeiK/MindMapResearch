Anxiety,fn4qass,t1_fn4ikrq,1586646671.0,"this is awesome, thanks!"
Anxiety,fn4fa25,t3_fz7ua9,1586640191.0,"my husband is currently dealing with this, it's an anxiety/ panic issue I think. not life threatening but feels terrible"
Anxiety,fn4en0c,t3_fzgkwo,1586639813.0,"in the meantime, what always helps me when I'm having panic attack is laying down in a cold dark room. Sounds fun huh? try it for an hour or so"
Anxiety,fn4ei5r,t3_fzgkwo,1586639735.0,you are worth medical care. Call a psychiatrist on your insurance and make an appointment asap!
Anxiety,fn4836i,t3_fytu3g,1586635976.0,my husband just recently started exhibiting this symptom and we thought he might have covid so we got him tested and it was negative. I'm convinced that it's due to an underlying panic issue that's causing it due to a recent job change and the isolation of being stuck home for so long. He thinks im minimizing his issues but in fact I can emphasize with it quite a bit as I suffer from panic as well. He doesn't want to believe it could be anxiety related and just went to have a chest xray. I guess we will see when the results come back if there's anything medical causing this but as of now I'm convinced it's the panic
Anxiety,fn47i28,t3_fz9agf,1586635630.0,"my anxiety has always manifested physically and I just actually wrote a new post about anxiety and exercise. But to your question, I've had physical issues with anxiety since I was at least 13 maybe younger but I don't remember. I would get a rapid heart beat thinking I was going to have a heart attack and die. I learned I have a panic disorder so that caused a lot of physical symptoms including getting very hot and sweaty, getting dizzy and feeling like I was going to faint and generally feeling like I was going to drop dead any minute. The only thing that makes me feel better (in an acute panic attack) is laying down in a cool dark room with little noise and the feeling of cool air blowing on me. I have to take benzos daily to control my anxiety and thank God for those pills because I don't think I would be a contributing member of society without them. MY anxiety isn't like others with anxious thoughts, it's literally a physical manifestation and that's almost all of it. So that's my wall of text, hope you know you're not alone out there"

personalfinance,fion8b9,t3_f8zdy1,1582586545.0,CT state law does not require the employer to pay out any pending vacation time upon dismissal from the company so if you left you would forfeit that vacation time.

personalfinance,filq3b1,t1_filpyrs,1582507593.0,that sucks they should give you a little leeway if you're otherwise always on time. Maybe if i call as PP suggested they'd waive. but seems like a lot of work when I can use the emergency fund and avoid any penalties and just pay myself back
personalfinance,filprja,t1_filpptf,1582507367.0,also true. you're probably right and this is probably the best plan of action

I wouldn't recommend consistently contracting but this sounds like a good opportunity for you to make some money before you return home.
