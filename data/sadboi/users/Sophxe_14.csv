BPD,fm0oi68,t3_fs3zye,1585662903.0,I have actually! He already knew I’d been diagnosed and was going to therapy so I send him stuff that I would relate to in order for him to understand me better. The only downside is he now knows how much power he has over me and he’s also a lil fucked up so he never thinks into it too deeply.

He’s decided he doesn’t want to be with me or anyone for that matter. He said he ‘loved me’ but not that he was in love with me just that he respected me and cared for me in that way. This conversation has really fucked me over. I’ve self harmed, I’ve dissociated and thought about suicide. He said he felt like he was on egg shells incase he did something that tipped me over the edge. I get all of what he’s said and it’s unhealthy and not going to work but I just can’t seem to get over it. I haven’t for months."

BPD,fjmmza2,t3_fe8cjl,1583475646.0,"I 100% get this. I was speaking to my Doctor the other day about my medication (for depression) and he asked how I felt. I found it so difficult to answer. So, I said the same as you really. That the tablets have allowed me to do simple tasks like clean my room, have more energy etc but the Borderline will always override that. So, although you may see me looking all chirpy here, I might not be in two hours. In two hours I may be looking at people jumping in front of trains, drinking bleach or I might be overdosing. 

It’s a super difficult question to answer which they either take as ‘you’re going to harm yourself’ or ‘you’re not that bad, you don’t need help’."
BPD,fjh40ua,t1_fjgzv79,1583340811.0,"You’ve literally just said how I feel. People will be like “break ups at hard”. Which, they are. Or they’ll say “Yeah, being ignored is hard, I know how you feel”. Which they do, to a certain extent. But it’s legit the difference between overdosing or not for us. Jumping in front of a train if they don’t reply to us for a few hours. I’ll go at least a month without talking to him and then I’ll legit crave him, like an addiction and I need that fix."
BPD,fjg60b9,t3_fd1j54,1583313118.0,"I think this is a great idea! I struggle with feeling unwanted or like, unappreciated. So, if someone was to do that small gesture for me, I’d probably cry. I’d say go for it, although, I’m not sure what type of girl she is, but she seems sweet."
BPD,fjg2we9,t1_fjg2g5i,1583309072.0,"Thank you so much💖 

I have said that to him before, that I’d like him to just completely block me on everything, and he does for a while but then unblocks me as he gets worried I’ll get super down and I’ll do something to harm myself."
BPDsupport,fjd2fp7,t1_fjatq51,1583243989.0,"I think that’s the thing, I feel he doesn’t even want to see me when he’s back. It’s like he is ‘doing me a favour’. But, I want to be friends with him or at least try and see where it goes from there. I shouldn’t have laughed at the end bit, but I did😅"
BPDsupport,fja4z9j,t1_fja3mg5,1583166495.0,"Sorry! Apologies, that’s my fault. I probably didn’t explain very well. 

Technically, we were never together because we knew he was heading to Canada but we were going to make it work and we were both on the same page of not getting with anyone else as it was only four months he was going for. We said our goodbyes, still spoke everyday and it was fine. But, I’d always questioned his love towards me. I felt he cared for me, but didn’t love me. I think he thought he did. So, a lot happened, with me self harming, just doing silly things that upset him because he couldn’t help me and it became too much to deal with and so he ended things properly. 

We still continued to chat as ‘friends’ although it wasn’t very friendly based, especially on my side of things. I then found out he’s fucked some girl but he ‘didn’t feel it was appropriate’ to say anything. But, again, we weren’t together so I was like forget it but it upset me a lot and we cut contact for a few weeks. 

But no, he’s not talking about getting back together etc. He just says he loves me, but it’s not going to work out. Which sucks. I know I need to move on but I’m finding it incredibly hard. Especially because he wasn’t like this when he was home and I feel he’s the only one that can help me. He’s the person I turn to when my mental health is poor. I think he also pity’s me a lot and that’s why he continues to speak to me and try help me. 

Sorry that was super long and not needed lol. Just thought I’d give context."
BPD,fj9rwlp,t1_fj9rev4,1583158049.0,"That’s okay! I’ve not actually been officially diagnosed as I’ve never seen a psychiatrist. However, nurses, GP’s, my therapist and a psychologist think I have. I’m not sure where you’re based (country wise) but you should definitely look into it more!"
BPD,fj9qb4s,t3_fcbglz,1583156837.0,"Hiii! So, in my experience my main sort of ‘symptoms’ are the following...

-Suicide ideation/self harm. 
-Impulsive as fuck, which can cause problems with money, sex, suicide attempts etc.
-I never realised it was a ‘fear of abandonment’ but, I’ve recently realised I’ll do anything and everything to make the people I love stay around me. Which can then result in unstable relationships (which is another symptom). 

But, everyone has different symptoms. Someone may relate to 5 of the symptoms and another can relate to 9 of them. But, if you look on the ‘Mind’ website, it’ll give you a clearer view:)"
BPDsupport,fj9c3sy,t1_fj9b6b6,1583141555.0,"Hiya! I just wanted to say thank you for the comment. It was super thought provoking. I think the main thing is when he left we were together, but things changed once he got out there and he’s back in April. So, I now have all these questions and would love to see him and would love to continue things but realistically, you’re right. It’s not going to be beneficial knowing these things, it’ll only hurt me and put me into a bad state of mind."

I assure you, I do not need your validation to jump in-front of a train. 

You’re not listening to what I’m saying either. You’re one of those people who will argue that the sky is pink until the day they die.

I posted on another BPD forum with context etc. Didn’t realise I had to write context for you.

Why you felt the need to attack me for that I don’t know. Maybe if you approached it in a better way, rather saying you ‘hate’ when people say the things I say, try educate. 

You’re looking at my post slightly black and white, which is funny because that’s a symptom of Borderline, maybe YOU should get some help."

I have the alcohol, I’d booked the hotel, I had the sertraline. The only thing I didn’t have it the Ketamine. But, in the time I couldn’t get the ketamine, my mind has now changed. But, I know I always have those things for a ‘just incase’ moment. 

I can see why it’s confusing though. It’s confusing for me. It legit becomes an obsession rather than wanting to do it. SOMETIMES."
BPDsupport,f7impd5,t3_dwegxc,1573762094.0,"Yes!!! OMG, I’m so glad you said that. It does become like an obsession doesn’t it. At some points it doesn’t even become about the pain, but more about the obsession of doing it."
BPD,f7ictdm,t3_dwdije,1573757315.0,"Yes! It’s almost like a phase. Which then reduces the seriousness of it. But you’re absolute right. I guess it’s knowing you’re able to do it. I think because it coincides with not feeling like you have anything to lose it becomes that much more easier. It’s an extremely odd feeling though because it’s like, if I wanted to do it, I just would? I always store my medication for a ‘just incase moment’. Knowing that all I need is a trigger and then I can do it. You know? 

Thank you! I’m wishing all the growth, healing and positivity Xx"
