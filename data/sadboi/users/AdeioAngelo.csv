Also testicular torsion is an emergency and it's possible that it can sort of untwist itself but not likely and so he would be pretty fucked by now if it was that. Other possibility is that it's a non sti related infection..but those are rare. All of the diagnosis fit his symptoms but all are also lacking some so it's hard. I'm still very scared though at the fact that his ex cheated and I could have something.

JuiceWRLD,facj052,t3_e8izfe,1575940486.0,"He had over 2500g on him (around 3700) and since it was over 2500g it is automatically considered trafficking. So it is not just possession which is 3-7 years, it is also trafficking which is 4-15 years. I don't know if sentences in Illinois are stacked but that's a lot of years, up to 22. There were guns found which could have been counted as use of firearm during offence, and since they were illegally in possession of the guns (in an airport) this likely would have happened. That can add another 15 years. Not to mention the unknown amount of codeine and pills that were on board. Worst case scenario he was looking at 40+ years. Best case scenario they would have been able to prove that the guns and drugs weren't his/all his and minimized the sentence but this would require him snitching on his friends and I'm willing to put money on him not doing that.

He also probably did not know all of this and/or possibly swallowed the pills in attempt to get rid of them as the sentencing for weed would be less than for harder drugs."

This would be a normal amount for an addict. If he wanted to die he would have taken more or just shot himself. Not taken the amount of pills he always does. The only other option I see being plausible is that he wanted to take them so that the police couldn't charge him with possession of them and he thought his body would be able to handle them."
