depression,ewtz7hc,t3_cpvwhh,1565758383.0,Felt this way many times.
thesims,ewtz4z6,t3_cpx8at,1565758316.0,OMG yes!
depression,ewno1aa,t1_ewn0xei,1565584161.0,This has largely been my experience as well.
depression,ewi1u8k,t1_ewhz4my,1565434482.0,"In my experience it’s the initial shock that drains people. Sometimes a friend will completely catch you off guard with it, but most of my friends are suicidal and depressed and the maintenance part of our friendship I find easy. Because I know what I’m up against, and I’ve been battling it a long time myself.

I’m glad you reached out in a time of need and I’m grateful that friend was so supportive. That’s a rare and beautiful friend you have. I understand taking short breaks, but don’t let a person like that out of your life. They can be the difference between casually considering suicide and going through with it."
depression,ewi15de,t3_co91bi,1565433470.0,"Every damn day. I actually believed I was alone in this, but clearly I was wrong. Kinda refreshing to know others may be walking around with the same interior monologue as me."
depression,ewbu6ri,t1_ew7dt9d,1565272393.0,I think I too prefer the latter because whatever I’m going through no one can help me with. It is nice though when people show that kind of compassion. Makes it a little easier to believe in the kindness of strangers.
depression,ew75sp3,t1_ew5t3gd,1565186614.0,"As someone who has broken down in public places, I promise you they don’t ask. It takes a ridiculously brave person to approach someone in tears, and most people have enough of their own shit to deal with. They aren’t going to help a sobbing mess if they don’t have to."
thesims,evvdr1t,t3_clhbgc,1564832815.0,You might also try repairing your game.
depression,evvckkm,t3_ckuptz,1564831272.0,"I get it. I realized this about myself recently as well with people I work with who were just mirroring the parts of me I hated. It’s why I felt compelled to comment because it can be incredibly isolating to think that way, and while I do agree with you, I think it’s also important to recognize that there’s usually more to the picture than we’re seeing through one emotional lens.
I have these weird moments of clarity sometimes when I’m not depressed and don’t hate myself where I look back at things I wrote when I felt that way, and I’m always surprised and a little appalled and confused that I could ever think that way, but in the thick of it, nothing else could look or feel more true.
I’m not trying to say you shouldn’t feel the way you do or think the way you do. We all got lives to lead and can and should live them how we want. It’s just that I used to think the darkness was all encompassing, that it was all I was, and as I’ve gotten along in years I’m starting to see some brighter spots that I never could have imagined before. 
I still choose to stay away from most people. I don’t like socializing because I’m awkward as hell, but I’m becoming more forgiving of myself of that as I get older. Just something to think about is all. 
You do you. It’s all probably a wash in the end anyway. Also, just for insight, I only commented because I could relate and was feeling particularly shitty about myself, and I’d always heard that if you try to do something nice for someone else it can help. I think at the very least it works like all other distractions do; takes you out of the moment and forces your brain to think down other avenues."
depression,evs0i4n,t1_evrzw3n,1564724828.0,"I often feel the same about people watching me. The longer I’ve dealt with depression the more paranoid I feel it’s made me. I don’t like that reality, but it is what it is, and like my depression I’m determined to deal with it on my own. The world has no preference for anything. Find little things that bring you joy. Love them despite what people may say to the contrary. It’s the things you love, not the ones who love you, that define who you are. And it’s perfectly okay to feel miserable at times. That’s the natural ebb and flow of life. Hang in there. I’m glad you exist."
depression,evs06n0,t1_evrys80,1564724478.0,By our very nature humans are creatures of comfort. Even a home place that is fraught with suffering is comfort; familiar. We crave the familiarity of home when away for any length of time.
depression,evrzt3v,t1_evrg3yr,1564724076.0,"I feel this way a lot lately. That voice is both right and wrong. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with being authentically yourself. Even if that is too much for some people. Fuck them, they don’t matter. Someone, somewhere will recognize you for being worth their time, and that’s where authenticity comes in. I know that isn’t easy. It’s terrifying trying to be okay with yourself in the face of other’s opposition, but you don’t deserve to hate yourself like this. You are lovely and worthwhile, especially when you don’t feel that way about yourself. Sometimes we just need help seeing that from others. You’ll preserve more dignity and earn your own self-respect the more you fight to live authentically."
depression,evrzcr2,t3_ckwgss,1564723597.0,"This has been my entire life, and honestly, I think that’s just how life is. Idk why we have this expectation of being ‘happy’ all the time, but it’s unrealistic. Life ebbs and flows. I would love to feel the highs every second of every day, but that’s impossible. If it weren’t for the lows, how could we define the highs? The secret I’ve found is managing expectations and rolling with the punches. I’m working on being gentler with my self-talk when I’m depressed, and recognizing when things are going well and just trying to be satisfied with that. It’s not easy by any stretch of the imagination. It does make the lows easier to bear, however, because I’m learning to recognize that feeling won’t last forever, and eventually I’ll basically be manic and working without sleeping."
