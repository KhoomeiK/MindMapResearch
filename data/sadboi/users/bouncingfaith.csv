Manipulation,faqgi9k,t1_f9whifa,1576302722.0,"Thanks for the answer. Busy week.. i prefer staying anonymous but i can say eastern europe.

Yeah the biggest issue for me the last one right now. Not language etc. I feel like someone said encrypted curse to me in conversations. Whenever i canmisunderstand i do it. And this became reality for me. I seem to not be able to seperate if s/he cursed at me or didn't. 

The pattern is usually very stupid so i want to believe i misunderstood. 

And actually it shouldntbe important but i feel scared to give an answer back! I feel cowardly(maybe we'll get in a fight etc. and im not used to fight). This makes me angry all the time

Note: sometimes not answering is good too, because when you misunderstand or be touchy about someone's sayings who you just met and tell them wtf etc. you'll be antisocial,weird or rude person in their perspective

Edit: they told me i should wait until the end of december for results btw"

Manipulation,f9rj7ma,t1_f9rgk5s,1575577089.0,"Ahh the first paragraph would helped a lot. Interview was 12 hours ago :D 

It went okay ish. It's IT internship in an fmcg company(big4)

This was final interview, they'll let me know until the end of this month. 

I sometimes struggled to speak while speaking in english because of the fucking word ""compartmentalize""**, i don't know why i wanted to use it... (english is my second language as u can see)

But i would love to have the confidence to express myself to others. I'm very low on confidence these days. Socializing is a nightmare.

Sry for long comment but i keep imagining situations where a person who i get negative vibes says bad stuff or even curse in front of others or one to one and i dont know what to do in those situations. I always tell myself i had to fight and win while i was younger. 




TL:DR; Im 28, have 4 years of experience and im an engineer but in my country finding a job is near impossible thats why im trying to get at least internship in a reputable company. I became socially akward and dont want to speak to people because they can mock me or humiliate or even curse me and i feel like i cant do jack shit about it.


Damn this was vent... thx"
