rickandmorty,fq8cc0h,t1_fq8btcu,1589162988.0,"Yeah ""overarching plot"" maybe isn't the words I would use to describe what they're doing, but I like the references to previous episodes and continuation of stories. Evil morty and the mystery behind him is really interesting and while he doesn't need to be in every episode, I'd like if theyd continue on it. Seinfeld I feel like is a good comparison to what I like. They often have mini sub plots going on throughout seasons, sometimes crossing through other seasons, and while each episode you could watch on your own, you get a lot more out of the show if you watch the episodes in order. Some episodes of rick and morty, you really dont need to see previous episodes and you could watch some of it out of order and get the episode. Some episodes although insist you know what happened in the season to understand what's going on and those are the episodes that I enjoy the most."

Currently at my work majority of the tests are already written (we have about 100% coverage) so we don't often write a test from scratch, mostly just editing them to fit the code we changed. But our philosophy is you break it, you fix it. To keep the 100% coverage, if it doesn't pass our pipeline, you need to fix the tests without ruining the integrity of the test, i.e. make sure the test makes sense and is actually testing correctly. We also have many required reviewers that take a lot of time going through the code before its even merged so that helps as well. Possibly this will change once we start making bigger edits to the codebase but for now it's worked quite well for us.
