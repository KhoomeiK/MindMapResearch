Since I believe I have ishtars blessing, i don’t believe I’m doing anything wrong or harmful by starting a relationship, Idk I’m still confused as ever but It will unfold in time.

For me this eerie, uncomfortable feeling is present almost everywhere around the world but it’s especially present near and in my childhood home, where a lot of my dreams take place. there’s a lot of odd spots in my house like my moms room and my room, it just always has a bad feeling.  the garden in order to leave the house I have to exit the garden door, because the way the houses are where I’m from (a Muslim country), there’s a wall around the whole house so you can use the garden in privacy. In my dreams I always have to make a run for it in order to get out of the garden, something would be hunting me or someone dangerous is in the house and I’m trying to escape, swiftly and quietly so they don’t catch me. it was always so scary for me trying to leave the house many nightmares resulted, but now I’ve learned how to fly so I can easily fly up and threw the trees. Lately I have been lucid flying so much in my dreams I’m really loving it. Thanks for replying, I think you helped me conceptualize what I this feeling is.
