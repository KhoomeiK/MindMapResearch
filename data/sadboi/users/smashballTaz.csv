You're making the world a better place already."
mentalhealth,fqw3smh,t1_fqw33e1,1589692040.0,"Yeah it's only took me 20 years. Better late than never. What helped me massively was I met up with an old work friend of mine from 8 years ago, and asked her if she had any tips for getting out of retail and into the sector she's working in (nursing).

I expected maybe a couple of links to some websites or the name of a good college, but instead she spent two hours with me and went into loads of detail what my options were, and what path to nursing she recommends in hindsight. And what area she thought I'd be a natural in. 

I ended up with 6 pages of notes. I'm still a little shocked actually. And when I said how anxious I was about doing the coursework, she said she'd always make herself available to help me with it, if I wanted her to.

I'm still in shock a and overwhelmed a bit. But now I feel like I have no excuse to at least try it out. I keep thinking about how, if I wasn't lucky enough to have that Saturday off of work, that all this might never have happened."

mentalhealth,fqw0zp5,t1_fqu0mwp,1589689905.0,"I totally feel your pain. I can't shake the feeling of worthlessness and guilt that comes with the feeling of not having progressed in any sort of career in the past 20 years.

I've ended up back at my mum's house, and I'm working in a shop, again. Although I love the staff and the job, and even some of the customers, this lockdown has made me realise that, actually, I DO have life goals that I want to, and CAN achieve.

And I'm gonna give it a go. I've applied to do to college in September. At 37 years old. Terrified of how my boss will react, but fuck him. He's a dick anyway.

I'm still having days where I freak out and panic and want to change my mind to stay in the safe routine of my supermarket job and seeing my work friends. And I sometimes think people will mock me in college and what if I'm terrible at it and I drop out. But I'm trying to ignore those thoughts as hard as possible."

Other than the unrequited feelings your have for her, is there another reason you keep in touch? And same goes for the former best friend too, any shared friends might be a good idea to leave behind if that's possible too. 

You may never fully get over your first love. And that's OK. Many people don't. It does sound like you fell for her way too deeply way too soon, and that sometimes can't be helped. 

You CAN move on though, eventually. And make sure that your aren't thinking of bettering yourself as a step towards winning her back one day. That is unhealthy and unrealistic."

TheLeftovers,fq3qn1j,t3_ggpec2,1589069100.0,"No, they never filmed it. It was such a well told story that we've all imagined it so vividly some of us can picture it in our heads.

I remember hearing Lindelof stating that he considered shooting some of the Nora on the other side scenes, but then decided against it. As that way it would be more ambiguous and the whole point was to put the viewer in the thought process of was Nora telling the truth or not?"

But I don't feel as though any of my friends would be willing, or that helpful, to listen to my rants or feelings much.

I think I convince myself that they are all busy with their own lives, families and problems so I rarely even try to call anyone. And in the past a few times that I have tried, it's not always gone well. Or they've been in a bad place themselves so we're unable to help. So that's put me off asking nowadays.

Stay strong, you can get through this! Xxx"
TheLeftovers,fpqsana,t1_fpqa4b2,1588830774.0,"A couple of weeks ago I was raving about it to a friend of Facebook, we were chatting about shows and films that make us emotional.

I was telling them how beautiful and sad and funny and dark and thoughtful the series was, and that even thinking about the show's music makes me cry sometimes, in a good cathartic way.

And it turns out she already knew about the show and was a fan! She's the first person in my social circle who knew and liked the show who found out about it independently. It really didn't get much attention over here on the UK it seems to me."

TheLeftovers,foa8z18,t1_foa6lat,1587642322.0,It was definitely in the script I bet. It shows the last minute panic where Nora thought she was about to die and had a change of heart. In my opinion.
TheLeftovers,foa8tye,t1_foa685c,1587642237.0,"They were never in Purgatory. There is a scene in the church where the representation of Jack's dad specifically says THIS ISN'T PURGATORY.

There's a really good long interview where Lindelof goes into depth about that with a reporter who had the same questions.

I would definitely watch this if you are a Lindelof show watcher, or even in general if you are interested into a look of how a show is written :

TheLeftovers,foa1oqu,t1_foa10oq,1587637502.0,Isn't that just a case of them mistaking him for a Guilty Remnant recruit? Because he's all in white and smoking. I missed that as well until someone else mentioned it :D

TheLeftovers,fo9reyn,t3_g6eh71,1587628525.0,"With regards to people still debating on hope much of the supernatural stuff 'actually happened', I think that's the point. There's plenty of 'evidence' that supernatural things have happened in real life, and yet mostly we dismiss them as coincidences or as things which have a scientific explanation that perhaps wasn't clear at the time.

A really good interwiew with Lindelof that I can't remember the source of right now, is that with 2% of the world getting Departed, they allowed 2% of supernatural things in the show. And with all of them there is a possible explanation. IE Wayne was always a fraud, Kevin's never really did due, etc. 

Years later and I can't stop thinking about this amazing show. Everything about it is perfect! To me

TheLeftovers,fnv5ub9,t1_fntcjyk,1587281274.0,"Even if that is the acting and scene direction advice that Lindelof gave to Theroux in order to get the reaction he'd wanted, it doesn't mean that that's exactly what the character of Kevin Garvey was thinking at the time.

We're not meant to know exactly what his wish was, otherwise it would have been explicitly stated in the show. A lot of the shows enjoyment, for me anyways, comes from all the different interpretations different people take from it. It's literally art in that sense.

Love it. I started a rewatch with my friend, we finished Season 1 recently just before the lockdown. Can't wait to carry on. Its so amazing seeing someone's initial reaction to each episode live, and then discussing the themes and what the show is about after each ep. Halfway through season 1 I think he realised that the show is not about why or how the Departure happened at all. Fantastic stuff."

Watching a Close Encounter of the Third Kind was amazing. And seeing Serenity on the big screen in a room full of fans for its 10 year anniversary was ace too.
