AskWomen,fplug8i,t3_ge1tsm,1588719690.0,"Manyyy years ago there was this one guy I really, intensely liked and the feeling was mutual. He was a year older and ended up moving away for college while I stayed behind. I think we both knew what we felt and wanted but seeing as we were young and he moved away nothing really happened. Saw him about a year ago after not having seen each other in at least 10 years. He tried/attempted to tell me something but was so completely wasted that I couldn‚Äôt understand him. He hasn‚Äôt lived in the city since he left for college, but I never told him anything."

I‚Äôve definitely been looking more into but figured someone would have better info than just reviews on the websites. this really helps considering I wasn‚Äôt sure if it should be a daily thing for weeks, or I could/should switch it up with other stuff. I currently don‚Äôt have anything for it but do use bio-oil and/or coconut oil. I‚Äôm so happy you‚Äôre getting good results! Thank you again üòä"
