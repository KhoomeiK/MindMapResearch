AmItheAsshole,fq1fokj,t3_gg4lpf,1589045235.0,"Hi, I’m [22F] only a little older than your girlfriend and I suffer infertility.  I’ve had miscarriages and they are painful.  I can empathize with your mom’s experiences.

THAT BEING SAID, please put your foot down.  Your mother is mutating into something from r/JustNoMIL and it will become a point of contention in your relationships with both your partner and mother.  Your mom needs to take a giant step back.  She’s trying to make your child her own.  Baby stealing is frowned upon.

Plus, your girlfriend is 8 months pregnant, for gracious sakes.  The last thing she needs to be dealing with is a pushy mother-in-law with no respect for boundaries that’s trying to steal her child.  And you better make it clear that if your girlfriend doesn’t want your mother at labor and delivery, then what your girlfriend says is LAW.  If your mother stresses her in labor and you allow it, shame on you both.  Start polishing your spine, my friend!"

Needafriend,fiskskh,t1_fis3bqb,1582686772.0,"I’ve studied a fairly broad variety of topics in history ranging from pre-ancient civilization to as recent as the Cold War.

Mythology in relation to history is more of a hobby interest of mine.

That’s a really complex question actually!  Mythology can be viewed as a niche field in and of itself, but it’s quite a bit messier than that.  Mythos fits into a bunch of categories, including, but not limited to: history (general, social, cultural), anthropology (general, social, cultural), philosophy, theology, and probably a few others that I’m forgetting at the moment."

AMA,fiqzw9g,t1_fiqyy2r,1582654598.0,"1) Yes, I have feeling!  In fact, I was incredibly excited right after surgery (and still very high) that my nipples survived the procedure.

2) I don’t know for sure, I believe they calculate percentages after surgery is completed so they can properly bill insurance.  It might be in the documentation, I’ll have to check!

3) Yep, that was definitely a problem that I had.  I couldn’t exercise because it would cause intense pain and my back would spasm from straining.  Fun fact, I couldn’t really drown because my breasts would act as flotation devices.  It was entertaining at first, but kinda awkward when you can’t go swimming at all because your chest bobs ahead of you like a couple of buoys under a tarp."
AMA,fiqxdzy,t1_fiqh4jk,1582653348.0,"1) That is a fantastic question that I actually do not know the answer to — perhaps med reddit can help!

2) Gland tissue is also removed in addition to fat.

3) My surgery was done with Wise pattern incision — that is, it looks like an anchor.  The incision goes completely around the areola/nipple, straight down to the fold of the breast against the ribcage, then curving along that fold of the breast.  Right now, 2 months post-op, they are very visible!  They’re a shade of dark purple, but should fade with time, so I’m told by my surgeon.  Either way, the scars don’t bother me, so it’s fine if they don’t fade much.

4) Among other reasons, primarily medical, yes.  The size was incredibly inconvenient.  Trying to find clothes that fit was a pain in the arse, bras were astronomically expensive, and I felt so uncomfortable in my body because I’m actually a fairly small woman.  I was swallowed by the size of my breasts.  People who knew me before are now shocked when they see me because they “didn’t realize how tiny I was”.  More than anything though, I had a lot of medical problems that were either caused or exacerbated by my extremely large chest."

My motivation was primarily medical necessity from chronic pain, spinal curvature, and muscle atrophy.  Secondary was simply feeling like a normal woman and not the wet dream of an anime weeb (I love anime, but it’s not fun to be just Boobies Girl).

• Pros- my husband liked them, could literally smother someone.
• Cons- horrible back pain, spinal curvature, clothes don’t fit, bras are ugly and very expensive and hard to find, my body is small (5’3”, ~150 lbs) and my boobs essentially swallowed me.

Small boobs:
• Pros- my husband also likes them and thinks they’re cute, drastically reduced back pain, spine is beginning to straighten and posture is improving, clothes fit, bras are cute and fairly inexpensive and can be found in most department stores, I am proportional and my figure is actually evident now.

AMA,fiqck1l,t1_fiqbnc4,1582641162.0,"I’m actually a little jealous that you got to spend the night!  They sent me home only an hour and a half after surgery and, holy jeebus, I was looped out BAD.  I cried because I wanted to take a nap, was generally Very Sad and wanted a hug and my emotions were everywhere, and I kept complimenting all of the nurses and telling them they were beautiful.  Told a nurse that he was a god because he brought me chapstick and water for my horribly dry mouth — that got a lot of laughs from the nurses in recovery room.  I even told my surgeon that I was so proud of him, I loved him, and to be safe as I was being wheeled out to the car to go home.  Love for you and you and you, everybody is getting some love, lmao.  My husband kept trying so hard not to laugh at me.

And YES, I can hardly wait to get new bras!!! I’m so excited — I was a HH cup before and trying to find pretty lingerie was practically impossible.  I can actually find cute things now!  There’s a lot of novelty involved with picking out bras to try on these days, haha.  My only bras so far have been sports and sleep/yoga bras, but they’re super comfy so I have no real complaints.
