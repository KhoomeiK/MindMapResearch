Embrace every part of yourself, nurture your body, take care of it, rest, love, dance, run, take pictures of yourself and show yourself off. Stop yourself from thinking negative thoughts. You are special, rare and beautiful, embrace it!"

needadvice,f0kv5n3,t3_d53uv5,1568688956.0,I listen to a lot of podcasts and Ted Talks when I'm home alone! I have a small apartment but I love having my own place compared to coming home to roommates. I can decorate it and keep it super cozy and personal. Think about how lucky you are to have your own place and embrace it!
