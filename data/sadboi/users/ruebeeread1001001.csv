My shrink gave this analogy: you have a perfectly beautiful and delicious cake...but there is a single cockroach in the middle, now the whole cake is ruined. Doesn't work the other way around if your cake is covered in cockroaches with one lovely piece in the middle!"

Anxiety,fo7kvc9,t3_g5lc4j,1587580059.0,"Like many other commenters I have to say THANK YOU for posting this right now. It really helps to see so many people who have similar experiences as a reminder that these are symptoms of a disorder and nothing more. 

Lately I've been saying ""past"" or ""future"" when an intrusive thought comes into my awareness. The brevity of the statements have been helpful because I can easily get overly wordy and consequently lose some of the power of confronting the thought."

pregnant,fmrmr0j,t3_fwye3g,1586328093.0,"Meee! I've been wrestling with this issue. I'm sure having OCD doesn't help üòÖ

That being said, my doctor told me to keep taking my normal 150mg dose so I'm doing my best to trust her judgement. The alternative for me (stopping) I really do think would eff up my homeostasis at this point and create some physiological manifestations that might not be so good for baby. Plus everything I have read pretty much says the same thing and suggests that sertraline is pretty much the best one to be on during pregnancy.
