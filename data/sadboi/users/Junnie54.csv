And well, I blocked him, we aren't speaking to this day (2 years) and he manipulated her. She has no friends now, because he became her only priority. And well, I thought we were great friends, but my trust was broken when my friends told me she was talking stuff about me."

mentalhealth,f6n411k,t3_ds3xqa,1572984388.0,"I think it's in your best interest to tell them. I know it can be really hard to open up to someone, but this is serious issue and it shouldn't be taken lightly. I would also advise you to tell them you are really trying hard (point out the medication and therapy) and tell them you are actively trying to get better.
As a person, who is struggling with mental health for the past two months, i admire your choice to go back to university. I have massive problems with doing my assignments and homework, so i really admire you. You are doing amazing, keep up the good work!"

Asking somebody for help is a great idea and even if you don't have the best relationship with your parents, i think it would be a good idea to try and talk to them. It could also strenghten your relationship. Please, give it a try."
