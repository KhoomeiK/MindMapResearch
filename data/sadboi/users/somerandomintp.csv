 It may contains some spoilers, but I try too keep them as minimal as possible!

The book is about an alien in the body of a math professor. Therefore he looks like a usual human being and, because of his job, is well known, but he doesn't know how to behave like one. As far as I remember it's written from the aliens/professors point of view and pointing out the weirdness of the human race (imo it's really funny - I laughed my ass off).
The alien slowly learns how to adapt human behaviour and suddenly feels somewhat of an ""emotional connection"" towards his ""family"" (wife, son and dog) and generally starts to enjoy the human way of life, even though it's actually inefficient, led by emotions and overall pointless.

Ok, that was a really short summary, but I didn't want to spoil too much. It's a book worth to read, in my opinion :)

I think it might be an absurd book, because it points out the absurdity of life, but also shows that you can embrace your way of life without a coherent meaning behind it.

I agree with that. Usually people just stick with what they're used to (at least if they're at least kinda comfortable with it) and therefore don't change that radically. 

I actually think that everybody uses all functions, just in a different way and intensity (the use of certain functions basically ""creates"" the type, if that makes sense). Therefore you can learn/practice how to use certain functions and theoretically change your type. I still think it's a rare phenomenon, but obviously it exists so you should accept when people do (even though it's kinda sad when external circumstances force people to change drastically...)."

That's interesting. How much do you think a type can change? 

Because, I agree with you that  personality can change over time, but I'm not quite sure whether the type itself actually changes. I don't think it's impossible, but personally I think it's rather unlikely. 

I think you're just becoming more mature over time. You develop all your functions bit by bit and that changes you as a person, but not necessarily your type. 

I don't know... maybe I missed something, so feel free to explain why you think types can change and how much they change (for example: I'd say it's rather unlikely that a dominant T type becomes a dominant F type, isn't it?).

Fist of all I think it's primarily about maturity. Of course some types tend to get along better than others, but I think if everyone is mature enough to spot and accept the differences between types and acts accordingly even an (just an example) INTP and ESFJ could genuinely get along. It's not about the type, it's about maturity.

But now to your question:

I/E: I notice, that I tend to get along with introverts slightly better, because they are usually better at accepting my need for alone time. But a lot of people I get along with very well are extroverts. I'm slightly more overwhelmed when I'm hanging with them and definitely need a break after, but when I'm fully recharged I always have a good with them!

N/S: I think we're all on the same page about this one. There are a few xSxx I get along very well (one in particular), but when I'm really not getting along with someone it's mostly S types. I don't really understand them and vice versa. In case you're both very mature and patient, you may complete eachother quite well, but it's gonna be difficult for sure. I think this discrepancy is the greatest and most challenging one!

T/F: It really depends. I think F and T types have the potential to get along very well and kinda balance eachother out, but it can also be a difficult relationship. As a thinker I'm often overwhelmed when someone is overly emotional. I tend to devalue emotions (I don't say that this is a good thing) and I'm therefore often seen as cold and unemotional especially by feelers. But when you find a way to communicate it can be a really good relationship. Personally I, for whatever reason, have quite ""a lot"" (for my conditions) ENFP friends and I get along with them very well, because we found a way to communicate. And to be honest they often help me to stay in touch with my own emotions.

P/J: Most of the people I know are xxxJ I got used to them and their behaviour pretty early on. My parents, my best friend - all INxJ's. Most of the time I don't notice any problems, except they are sometimes a little annoyed that I'm so indecisive. Personally I enjoy having a J type around, because they help me getting my shit together.

All in all: there are noticable discrepancies, but imo it's about maturity, not about the type!"

Every person is unique so I wouldn't say there's a black or white answer. I think it really depends on how well developed both persons are. It could be a great relationship, because they would know exactly how the partner approaches life, but from personal experience (I'm an INTP and one of my close friends is the only INTP I know personally) I'd say it also could be an absolute catastrophe. My INTP friend and I get along very well, but when I imagine being in a relationship with them - oh, boy! I think we'd both kinda loose the approach towards reality and just slowly sink into absolute chaos. We'd probably be happy, but definitely not people contributing to society in any form xD

Personally I think (from personal experience, my ex-partner, now best friend is an INTJ) INTP-INTJ Relationships/Friendships are pure perfection.
