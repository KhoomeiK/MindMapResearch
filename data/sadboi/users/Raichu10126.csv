Also really do some jump roping. It’s a great way to lose weight. Try to get a mediation app or YouTube video to help with breathing. That will help too!

mentalhealth,fp86sdq,t1_fp7bdnl,1588384971.0,Hmmm it sounds like when your inside and overthinking it just sucks the life out of you. Have you thought about add live plants to your home making it more lively? This will bring some outdoors inside and add some color to your home. It’s a small suggestion but it could help. Also the oxygen released from the plant could give you some needed energy.

gayyoungold,foex2ns,t1_foev5pt,1587717821.0,Sounds like a major crush. I think the mystery of him combined with this masculine exterior and features makes it more fascinating fro you. You have never seen such a handsome man so you think about him. Who is he? What does he like? etc.? This mystery is both romantic and arousing. I get it. You mixing love with intrigue.
gayyoungold,foe7g4e,t1_fo9tkjc,1587697560.0,Really think about what it is that makes you attracted to him aside from beauty. Maybe it’s his ethnicity and age. It’s different and hard to come by. Maybe it’s his rugged exterior compiled with working in a highly masculine job makes you more horny and attracted to him.

Now I realized due to my inexperience and sexual frustration, it was just an infatuation."
