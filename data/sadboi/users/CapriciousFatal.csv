solar,fqo7inm,t1_fqnpaoo,1589509166.0,"Ahh I see. It‚Äôs actually for an unusual reason. I have seasonal affective disorder. I live in Canada and get depressed every winter (am unable to work and barely able to study). This is due to lack of sunlight not temperature or anything. So I decided to look at areas to move to in the US. 

I looked at some historical weather data for LA, Dallas and a few other places. The data I found from various sources (Weather Underground, The Weather Channel etc.) but was highly inconsistent.

So I decided to go really technical and I landed upon Solar Irradiation data from NREL and tabulated the DNI data. 

So coming to my point, I need to know if I can expect areas with higher DNI to be more sunny!"
