My guess(!!!!) is that over the years, he stopped caring for his wife for whatever reason, and you being her child, he shoved his resentment over to you since you probably have a few similar characteristics. He blamed his dissatisfaction on her, and thinks that everyone would be upset with his situation aswell. I guess thats what he means by ""the real you"".

But the truth is surely far from that, he sounds like a person that finds a million mistakes in others before finding a single one in himself, and isnt interested in looking for one either. A lot of projection and a lack of empathy and general interest in others."

2. No. After getting in debt and being totally broke, I got a deal with a fellow poker playing friend, where he ""stakes"" me. He buys me in to every game I want (within reason), we split the profits 50-50, but what I lose, he pays 100% of. A long-lasting deal where its the total profit we share. This is not my first such agreement. The other people I've had to do this deal with, after reckless spending on other things (and gambling on sportsbetting and slots), has left me broke. Those people have earnt pretty good money on me so I have the references, kind of. So for me theres absolutely no risk of losing my own money, I can just earn, but what I earn (from playing, not working) I ""only"" get 50% of. I plan on keep doing this even if I save up a lot and have the ability to risk my own money after a while.
3. I cannot be certain ofcourse, but I'm pretty sure the answer is no. I have gambling issues related to sportsbetting and slots when manic, but poker has always been a steady income. I don't view it as gambling as such, I can manage that. Excluding myself from every possible bookmaker has been done and now sportsbetting is really hard to do logistically.
