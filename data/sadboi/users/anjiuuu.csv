mentalhealth,foj4ebi,t1_fo4f2c2,1587807920.0,"I think there's nothing particularly to worry about, I think u have a very imaginative mind...I definitely think it's not healthy after a certain point..I mean there are some goals and decisions that suit you and will help you grow..and some that aren't..but corruntly..it's harmless :) how old are you? I think if ur still a teenager ..it's pretty common to fantasize about imaginary goals..but it looks so cool. It's fine even if ur older..I'm 22 and I do this a lot haha.
You only need to rethink about this habit of its interfering with something in ur life..so whether this is unhealthy or not,, is pretty subjective and kinda up to you! Y'know what I mean?"
mentalhealth,foj414y,t1_foj2pj3,1587807507.0,"I think the answer lies in her getting her mind off of all the questions and confusion in her mind for the time being. I presume job prospects are bleak for everyone until COVID situation becomes better ..she needs to do something to get her mind off of the turmoil and confusion in her mind. 
U mentioned that she doesn't take constructive criticism in the best way, I think she gets confused when ppl discuss her prospects..she badly wants to make a decision she is confident of and strongly believes will turn out right, and stick to it..and I'm sure she is smart enough to do that. As an and when she makes a decision ..whether it be to leave her country and work while living with you or something else..she will realise slowly what needs to be done and may help in bringing her confidence back.
I'm going through something similar to what she is, and I'm just trying to answer ur question to what I know best from talking about my problems to my parents and loved ones, and I have come to the realisation that the uncertainty of the future is causing a lot of emotional turmoil..I'm itching to do something , take some action that will clear my way ahead ...calm the doubts and questions of 'what if'..after a point it becomes emotionally exhausting
She also needs to make peace with the fact that there's no perfect decision! She may know it..but takes time to actually say -'Ill be alright doing so and so!'
She is going to have to compromise on one thing or the other when she makes a particular decision...easy to say ..but it must be very difficult for her to actually accept it! 
Someone needs to explain its no point crying and moping about it..as u already know
I hope this helps u understand her situation better...there is no 'one' solution because there is inherently no 'problem' ..it's her mind which is in a bit of a conflict.."
mentalhealth,foiuo30,t3_g7lo2d,1587797595.0,"Hi, firstly I want to appreciate u for being so caring towards ur girlfriend. There aren't many ppl as nice as you. I feel you could do one of these things-
Reach out to a friend or family member of hers who she is close with..ask them if they could also keep an eye on her or talk to her depending on what she is comfortable with.
Her behaviour seems to point to the fact that she hasn't quite picked up how to 'adult'...in that way she is a lot like me..so what I do is make it a point to keep myself busy with things other than games/my phone. 
Her behavior will take time to change..whatever she is going through will affect her less when she is out and about and working at a job or whatever. 
Is she particularly shy? Does she suffer fr social anxiety? Does she tell you she is terrified or scared of working/job prospects? Is that making her irritable or frustrated? 
Take care. You both will get through this."
mentalhealth,foh1quc,t3_g7adld,1587759532.0,"I feel you, I'm going through this right now and feeling very irritated, scared, haven't had the motivation to bathe too. Firstly, does the sheer amount of work overwhelm you? Start with tasks or assignments that are smaller. Do u have a friend who can help u with the work over video call or something? 
Personally my entire 4 years of uni has been one long hellish period of procrastination and regret...I knew I had potential but I couldnt complete much of my work entirely and whatever I did complete wasn't to my satisfaction.
Another tip: don't think about completing ur work perfectly...try dividing ur work into segments: eg. Into topics/chapters for assignments..write down what u need to read/learn for each assignment..that will give u motivation.
Hope this helps, really. 
Be hard on yourself, ull thank urself. I mean, no breaks until you've atleast sorted ur work into segments, etc. So, if u take a break after that, ull feel motivated to come back coz ull be feeling like u have accomplished atleast a part of it.

Good luck"
