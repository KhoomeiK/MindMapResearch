ptsd,feir7vs,t1_fegn92r,1579145176.0,"This definitely sounds like a toxic work environment. It's also not about him handling the customer better but rather him not going through the same things you did. You are capable and amazing at what you do. We just struggle because of our disabilities. Staying in a job like this might make it more difficult to recover and I do hope you can find something better. A place where your coworkers have your back and treat you like a part of the team.

We are also our hardest critics and I am still working on being nicer to myself and give myself credit for the little achievements. If you like music I sometimes listen to Christina Perri - Little Victories. That song always motivates me when I don't believe I do enough. You are always welcome!"
ptsd,feflb6u,t1_fefk9b9,1579058755.0,"You are welcome!

One of the toughest things I went through is talking about it at first and it can be very triggering at first and the nightmares were pretty bad. Therapy can be tough but with time you will be given the tools to tackle them so you will still have the symptoms from time to time but they will become manageable and less noticeable. Sometimes when they are and big stressors arise they can come back with a vengeance so it is crucial that you give yourself patience and understanding. 

Sometimes if the place you work at is not working out for you the best thing to do is switch to a better job. It's your second home so it is important. I'm in a similar spot as you and performance can be affected by PTSD. I've even considered going on disability but that is a struggle in itself. Don't be afraid to also talk, with your therapist, about financial situations and what ideas you can come up with. I currently work in customer service and dealing with those customers are impossible at times. I'd do something else however unfortunately I only have years of experience in that field and nothing else. I hope you find something that works for you!"
ptsd,fefcvuh,t3_eov7wm,1579053585.0,"Nightmares are very common with PTSD I was prescribed Prazosin to eliminate that problem so that could be something to talk with your psychiatrist to see if it is right for you and is a constant problem. Overall symptoms can come and go. I've had months where I didn't suffer from flashbacks, nightmares, night terrors, and the hyper vigilance. I go to therapy once a week and see a psychiatrist every other month. They help immensely. Grounding techniques help with panic attacks. Give yourself time and patience. Know that PTSD does not have a cure however you can reach a place where you can manage the symptoms. Also it is recognized as a disability so if accommodations need to be put in place you can speak with HR to set that up if need be. Also know you are not alone and we are here to help you along the way! *hugs*"
