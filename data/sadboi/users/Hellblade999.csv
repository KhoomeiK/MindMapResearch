Obviously you might respond that you're just accepting reality and thus hating yourself is a byproduct, but I really asked myself where this hit to the self-esteem came from when I told myself I hadn't a chance to begin with. It was **hope** that was driving this feeling. A sign that I should hold out longer.

FinalFantasy,fqng4q5,t3_gjsok5,1589494246.0,"My version stretches it to 20, although you could probably condense it.

Chapter 1: The Kalm flashback. It will serve as a tutorial, and set up the plot of the game nicely with the allure surrounding Sephiroth.

Chapter 2: They might potentially stretch out the second half of the flashback to a second chapter. Tonally, the two parts of the flashback in the original are different to one another, so it doesn't seem totally off for it to be two chapters.

Chapter 3: Exploring the Midgar Area / Grasslands Area world map equivalent, and the Chocobo Farm / Midgar Zolom (renamed Midgardsormr) segment. The marshes themselves could be an entire dungeon, padded out a further chapter.

Chapter 4: Mythril Mines (probably renamed Mithril Mines) will be an entire chapter ending with the Turks. We might have an Ark Dragon or Turks boss fight.

Chapter 5: Fort Condor. It was optional in the original game until Disc 2, but there's no way they won't force us to go there at this stage. If they choose to include a minigame similar to the one in the original, they might have it accessible at Save Points when another mission comes up like with Blitzball in FFX.

Chapter 6: Potential Yuffie encounter? Our equipment gets stolen, and we spend a portion of the game finding Yuffie and recruiting her. This might be swapped with Ch. 5 in terms of order, though.

Chapter 7: The Lower Half of Junon, including Bottomswell, saving Priscilla, and getting to the top of the tower.

Chapter 8: All of the events including the Rufus parade. Upper Junon has a lot of potential in the Remake, so there's a chance they might stretch it out even further (which I'm not too fussed about, because it's a pretty big area storywise and area-wise).

Chapter 9: The Cargo Ship segment.

Chapter 10: Costa del Sol, the Corel segment, leading up to the Gold Saucer.

Chapter 11: Corel Prison. I can't see them deviating from the source material much here. Perhaps they'll start 11 at the Gold Saucer where we recruit Cait Sith?

Chapter 12: Gongaga. We will learn more about its history, and I can totally see a Heavy Tank boss fight. The Aerith/Zack connection is a big reveal.

Chapter 13: Cosmo Canyon and Cave of the Gi. Can't wait to see Bugenhagen on his floating green orb! (I always used to think he was shaped like a Russian doll until recently when my mind was blown).

Chapter 14: Nibelheim and the Shinra Mansion. We will recruit Vincent at this stage, and there will be more story focus regarding the town's burning down.

Chapter 15: Mt Nibel.

Chapter 16: Rocket Town, and recruiting Cid. (However, how will they work in recruiting Cid this late in the game? Perhaps they might end it earlier. Shinra Mansion is a good area to end Part 2 with a Sephiroth encounter, IMO, and ending Part 3 at Meteor's summoning is pretty good, too. Then you can have a mandatory Wutai quest shortly into Part 3.)

Chapter 17: Finding the Keystone.

Chapter 18: Temple of the Ancients. This would actually make an amazing final area, but it doesn't make much sense to end the game here instead of...later on.

Chapter 19: Bone Village, Sleeping Forest, Coral Valley.

Chapter 20: City of the Ancients being the final area. You know what happens here.

&#x200B;

They honestly have a lot of ways to go about this. I think the likely candidates for ending Part 2 are at the Mansion or at City of the Ancients. The former would make the game four parts IMO.

If the ending is at the Mansion, padding out the Marshes for a full chapter, Junon a little more, making the Gold Saucer its own chapter, and splitting up Cosmo / Gi Cave could push it to 18."

ForeverAlone,fqmxtsu,t1_fqkz5c4,1589485331.0,"There’s some good pieces of advice in here but I’d love to play devil’s advocate. 

Exercising and keeping fit are excellent activities, but you don’t need to do them “every day” as you put it. A large chunk of people are overweight yet still find relationships, and a lot of people have average bodies but find partners all of the time. Again I’m not encouraging OP to not do these things, but you don’t need to be a fitness freak. Maybe that’s not what you meant, but at face value what I’m taking is that you need to be more fit than the average person.  

The confidence and charisma thing makes sense. You need to be at least decently well socially adjusted, and the bar isn’t as high as people say it is. If you think a class will help then that’s fine, but again it’s not a requirement. Most people don’t need these classes to find partners. Really as long as you can approach people without a lot of trouble or hold a conversation decently well, you’re good to go and it’s mostly about meeting the right person. 

Which you cover in the next point:

Meeting someone by putting yourself out there is the hardest part, indeed, but otherwise I agree with you 100% here. I’d recommend joining clubs if you want to meet people. There’s no guarantee as you say, though. You might live in a shitty area or have interests that aren’t gender or age appropriate.

It sucks there’s no guarantees. I did watch a video about someone talking to an “incel”, and the person talks about the things he tried already (which included advice that you mentioned) and how they didn’t work. There’s probably another issue going on if trying these things didn’t bet you success, because if they were the problem you’d find that out by trying said pieces of advice."

* I never heard from anyone that someone had a crush on me

I really feel like something went wrong shortly after I left university. After being thrust into the real world and realising how little it cares for me, my mental state just deteriorated. I couldn't get a graduate job and ended up settling for working in a supermarket because I didn't expect any better. Then that job got really, really stressful so I quit without another lined up. I wasn't the only person who did that, mind you, because the entire place went to shit. Then I spent six months unemployed, leeching off of the money I saved up at that place only for me to find a job that was lower paying and for less hours. It was better at first, admittedly, but now it has begun to wear on me. Then the pandemic happened so I'm stuck career wise for a while, but everyone is in the same boat so I can't really complain there.

My pervasive dating failures, inability to gain traction with my career, perceived and actual shortcomings with the gym and my appearance etc. are what created the person I am today. Failing really demotivates you, particularly when you see everyone around you succeed and live their lives. I just want a bare minimum existence now, not the one that I always dreamed of, because it's the safest route to not end up feeling incredibly depressed. 

The thing is, other people have highlighted strengths in me. People have tried to help me with women, give me advice etc. They can't understand where I'm going wrong. I just feel like I've been extremely unlucky with my social circles and life situation, and it has made me spiral and feel like everything is pointless.

As I said I've tried this. Take the gym for example. I've been at it for years. I've bulked and cut four times. I've tried powerlifting, bodybuilding, callisthenics, weighted callisthenics, high volume training, low volume training, training for strength, doing 100 pull-ups a day, eating anywhere from 2000-4500 calories a day in periods, and my body barely changes. I literally have friends who never exercise and eat packets of doughnuts each day who look better than me. Like I'm not trying to say that I look god awful, but I certainly should look better for the effort I put in.

People say you just need to ""try trying"" or try harder but I honestly don't know what else I can try. I see people who lift half of what I do in the gym who are like 4x my size. I just accepted it's never going to happen for me and I should just go to the gym to be healthy. Like at least I'm fit and conditioned: I could do nearly 30 pull-ups in a row at my best, do 100 pull-ups in 10-15 minutes, 500 push-ups in half an hour, and I have a low resting heart rate and a testosterone level in the 800s. For some reason this hasn't translated to me looking remotely athletic, and even see any smidgeon of abdominal definition I have to weigh in the 160s at six feet tall. Trust me when I say that I've tried everything and adjusted my lifestyle accordingly but nothing has paid off. Then you get some guy on YouTube trying the one-punch man workout and getting ripped in 30 days. Like fuck, when I tried something like that I just ended up even more skinny fat.

I know very few people like me who respond as poorly as I do. Don't get me wrong I'm fucking proud that I've stuck at the fitness thing consistently and that I'm as strong as I am, but I wish I had something physical to show for it.

But back to the self-improvement thing: yeah, I hear you.

I'm not going to purposefully become a slob and pretend it makes me happier. Because it doesn't.

It is. But the problem is people think that if you accept yourself, you're settling or ""coping"" somehow. That you could be so much more if you improve yourself.

So much more for what though? Yourself? Why continue stressing about these things if they make you unhappy?

If you never accept yourself, you're never going to be happy. You have to be happy with who you are regardless of your life predicament. Saying shit like ""oh things will be good when I get this new job, new body, women, etc."" is going to make you forever miserable.

You're probably used to being at this body fat and your clothes fitting a certain way, and once that changes it feels like you're losing all of your gains and that you're tiny...In addition to this, clothes are generally not built for athletic people, and they often favor people with bigger waists and smaller shoulders, which only adds to your perception of feeling small in your clothes.

This is so freaking relatable, and absolutely on the money.

I have shirts that I wear at work every day that have weird proportions. They're tight in the shoulders, chest, and back, but flare out at the sleeves and hang a lot around the waist. Regular fits have enormous arm sockets, so much that I swear you'd need like 19 inch arms to fill them out. In addition to this, people have asked why I keep tucking in my shirts at work. It's because they're so damn droopy in the waist and they sometimes make me feel small.

Unless you're actually losing muscle mass (significant size and strength loss), the difference isn't as big as you think, OP. I saw a photo of myself when I was lean compared to when I was bulked and sure I was smaller, but I didn't look nearly as skinny as I thought I would."

Compare it to grief. You don't tell a person who is trying to get over loss that whatever they do is ""cope"" because they're deep down miserable about that loss. No shit they're miserable. But there are ways to deal with that grief to make the wounds hurt less without denying the reality, which is a perfectly healthy healing process. There's a clear difference between lying to yourself and working on your mind.

Honestly, life got better when I started expecting less out of it. When I stopped chasing success, money, and focusing on dating, it took the pressure off of me and I started to get in touch with what I loved more. It's been the best mindset I've found in years, and my mental health is much improved.

I was the first of my friends to think about it for sure and I always had strong crushes on girls from quite a young age. Romance consumed a huge part of my mind and entering puberty, I realised that I have a pretty high sex drive and am a sexually motivated person.

This post did strike a chord though because after a while, I stopped thinking about relationships and sex as a big deal. When you've been without them for a long period of time--like entering your 20s and beyond without them--your brain kind of adapts to going without them and you go through periods where they don't cross your mind all that much. So this apathy becomes ""normal"", and only is it when you hear about the lives of others do you realise how different from the norm you are. And when you do hear about the lives of others, you wonder what happened for you to not be able to measure up so to speak. It feels like you're part of a different world.

You know, there's part of me that thinks if I was successful in the realm of dating, I'd be one of those guys who has a lot of sex. Maybe not with a multitude of people like serial one-night stands, but I'd be one of those people who wouldn't really have a problem finding a date and would've had a fair share of girlfriends and sex as a result."

AskReddit,fojgceg,t3_g7id84,1587820116.0,"Psychological horror easily. With gore, what you see is what you get. A guy getting disembowelled is a guy getting disembowelled. With psychological horror the terror comes from fear of the unknown and what you create in your head, which adds a layer of depth to it. That thing stalking you and not knowing what it is capable of until you see it can be filled in by your imagination, and this ""what if"" factor can bleed over into real life and make you feel paranoid. I also think that psychological terror is more relatable than gruesome violence in real life and therefore more effective, meaning there's more food-for-thought with psychological horror (and thus ensuing paranoia). This process can be quite analytic and introspective, and I love it when films make me think in this way.

Gore is fine as horror when it sits in the context of the narrative and not there just to shock or traumatise for the sake of it. The original *Saw* had gore, sure, but it sat in the context of well-thought out psychological horror (Jigsaw's modus operandi) unlike its sequels that simply wanted to show blood and guts. Body horror is also a good example of gore used appropriately, such as the degradation of Goldblum's character in *The Fly*, the threat in *The Thing*, and the chest-bursting sequences in the *Alien* series. Gore can also be good horror to portray the brutal reality of a threat, such as in a zombie attack, but excessive dwelling on it like in the *Saw* sequels, *I Spit On Your Grave* remake, and *Hostel Part II* only serves to shock/disturb and doesn't do a whole lot for me. It has its audience, sure, but it doesn't personally do it for me."

ForeverAlone,fnwp1t5,t1_fnwkfom,1587322629.0,"I get you.

Like I know life isn't fair and all, but this is a joke. I'd have thought self-improvement just meant going out of your way a bit to be a better person, and fixing minor things that you had no idea were hampering your chances. Like zigging instead of zagging, or trying something slightly different. To me it has felt like a long-term project warranting several angles of introspection and assault, and yet I still feel like I'm not even close to achieving what is expected of me.

It doesn't even feel like a minor handicap, like everyone starting with a bit more money than you at the beginning of Monopoly. It literally feels like every property costs ten times as much compared to everyone else with regards to getting one house on it, and yet you still get impoverished revenue if someone else lands on the square you own.

The deeper I dive into the self-improvement conundrum, the more absurd it gets. That's why I can't believe in it anymore. Of course I still think that mild levels of self-improvement are fine, like eating a bit better and exercising more, or trying some new clothes and reading a few self-help books, but undergoing some Sisyphus-caliber task just harms you mentally and makes you feel like you're never good enough. Less really is more here: it's the dark side of self-improvement no one ever mentions.

If self-improvement hasn't worked for you? It's something else, no doubt. If it was SI you'd have dating success. Don't let anyone shame you otherwise. You should be proud of what you've achieved if you've gone out of your way to better yourself."

Having maxed out materia ruins that experience and I can't see equipment and abilities carrying over from the previous game for that reason. Having Curaga and Firaga from the outset doesn't seem congruent with the Final Fantasy experience, particularly if we see the addition of materias like ""Earth"" and have to nonsensically level up Quake when you already have Lv. 3 spells of every other element.

Brainwave though regarding this (endgame spoilers, beware):>! when Aerith alludes to the party entering Destiny's Crossroads and the fact they may end up ""changing"" when coming out, it might be a reference to their skills and abilities being reset. It's kind of like when Sora loses it all in Castle Oblivion or after the Mark of Mastery exam.!<

IMO they should include a lot of the materia from the previous part, resetted, and have you develop it at the same rate alongside the new materia you get. Reusing and relevelling the same materia does not come across as boring at all: Dark Souls re-used the same spells across games and no one complained. 

Personally I don't think the Level Cap being set at 50 in the first part is indicative that it'll carry over. It's curious, sure, but I just think the developers chose to lower the level cap because it thematically makes sense to not have your characters be that overlevelled for only a fraction of the story.

XIII's battle system was great fun and 7R took one of the best aspects of it--the Stagger system--and used it appropriately.
