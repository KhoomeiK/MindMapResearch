But then the glow and all lights I saw started shutting off like someone was flipping the power breaker switches. And I could feel the darkness approaching from behind me, and then i felt a dark presence making its way to me I just had the feeling I was about to die, the darkness increased speed and then it hit me engulfing my body in an instance and I no longer felt anything, no thoughts, I couldn't see anything, not even darkness, I had no thoughts and cannot remember what the feeling was, I stayed in that state of non existence or an uncertain amount of time( irl I was in hospital at the time) when the peak started to fade I regained ""consciousness"" being transferred into an ambulance.
