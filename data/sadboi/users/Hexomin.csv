science,fehm5a2,t3_ep3gm3,1579119345.0,"The paper seems to be suggesting that there is a causal link.

> The findings of our study suggest that if a woman is not having sex, and there is no chance of pregnancy, then the body ‘chooses’ not to invest in ovulation, as it would be pointless.

~~I don’t see how the data support this conclusion. They didn’t exclude causation in the other direction, which seems more plausible to me. Low oestrogen during menopause can cause, for example, vaginal dryness and thinning, making sex painful and thus causing people to have less sex.~~

I stand corrected on this point. 

> This study has attempted to control for this factor through adjusting for both oestradiol levels and the woman's self-perceived overall health, with the association between sexual frequency and ANM still persisting following this adjustment. This suggests that—even when controlling for the complicated relationship between health, hormonal fluctuations and desire for sex—the menopause may be somewhat facultative in response to sexual behaviour, rather than being solely the result of a physiological constraint (e.g. degrading oocyte quality).

I do wonder though if testing oestradiol levels only on 5 occasions over 3 years is adequate to capture the variation over time and adequately control for it."

askgaybros,feeym2b,t3_eorl46,1579044078.0,"The biggest danger is from low blood pressure. Poppers cause blood vessels to dilate temporarily, dropping your blood pressure. On their own, this isn’t too harmful (unless you have preexsiting cardiovascular disease), but if combined with other vasodilators, this can cause a life-threatening drop in blood pressure and even cardiac arrest. This means absolutely don’t mix them with blood pressure medication or erectile dysfunction medication.

There’s also a risk of [methaemoglobinaemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methemoglobinemia). This occurs when the iron in haemoglobin gets oxidised, making red blood cells unable to transport oxygen. It’s fairly uncommon, unless you have a genetic predisposition to it, but there are case reports of it occurring with poppers use. It can be life-threatening in severe cases.

Legal equality doesn’t mean all discrimination disappears. Most LGBT people experience discrimination at some point.

Is it possible to not experience it. Sure. I’m gay and don’t really think I’ve ever experienced homophobia. Same sex marriage was legalised where I live when I was 5. I knew my family and friends wouldn’t care when I came out. I’ve never felt ashamed to hold my boyfriend’s hand in public. The closest thing I’ve experienced to homophobia is mildly awkward and ignorant questions from straight people.

However, I realise that I’m about as privileged as can be in the LGBT community, and that my experience isn’t typical. I wouldn’t tell another LGBT person that they haven’t been discriminated against just because I haven’t."
