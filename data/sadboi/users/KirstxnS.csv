That sounds about the same style I follow; I can‚Äôt strictly say I‚Äôm a satanist yet as I need to learn more but I find TST fits more of my personal values and I appreciate what they do as a sort of political group.

I do agree that all art is ‚Äòart‚Äô and that I have no right to decide what can or can‚Äôt be considered art, the title/point is really just me not being able to articulate what I really meant at the time.
