GraveyardKeeper,fgo9sz2,t1_fc562h5,1580963386.0,Oh! That makes sense! I think I did things out of order because she was so useless for so long... I'm talking 2-3 in game months. Thanks much!
GraveyardKeeper,fgo9qib,t1_fc584zb,1580963333.0,Thank you!

Autistic,f9ffgek,t3_e4to2s,1575269567.0,"I have that and it's so frustrating. Generally I have a default action like video games or writing that I do until I forget that I couldn't figure out what I wanted. It works as a sort of 'reset' button.

As for not feeling things like temp, hunger or thirst, this can happen to normal people and, while certainly not the most healthy thing in the world, generally you can still sense a secondary symptom (IE I haven't eaten in way too long and now I have a stomach ache) and use it as a context clue."

medical,f8c94pj,t1_f84jwre,1574455316.0,I was thinking that if the force was strong enough to get ANY of  the stomach contents out while bypassing the possibility of it going into the the lungs then it'd be something to do while you waited for an ambulance.

Tell me about the debt though? Again I only have my own experience to go off but for most situations you can get that stuff wiped off your record. I suppose it'd help to know where you are?"
SwagBucks,f6ahspw,t1_f5weblv,1572757081.0,"You should receive and email and a pending credits statement under the activity tab. if not, check how long the disclaimer says it'll take to say pending (different from credited) and then email the peoples. Warning though, if you didn't download it from the right source (and sometimes if you did) you won't get credited b/c they can't verify it."
abuse,f5vtt0t,t1_f55pdnm,1572499860.0,"If you just agree with her? (as for the guilt trips, I had one of my parents do that, fun stuff. Finally one time I said, 'you know that's not true but I can't keep repeating it.' After that I just shrugged.)"

depression,f54ixvy,t1_f547b1r,1571984211.0,"I'm currently on a cocktail of meds, the side effect of one of the mood stabilizers is I can't cry. I can't stop taking it or I cry every day. Sometimes I skip and go on AO3 which is where I go to drown in tears."
abuse,f54isne,t3_dmjlmr,1571984095.0,"So, have you heard of gaslighting? Basically it's where they do a thing then say they didn't. Or don't do a thing and say they did. Or drive you to tears and claim they didn't notice you were upset because you didn't show it (despite you clearly remembering crying). As an autistic person it's one of the things I hate most in the world (my view on reality is challenged by people enough thank you very much!) If you can get out, get out. If you can't keep contact to a minimum and as I like to call it 'play dead'. Someone once said, ""Teen boys are easier to raise because if they want to disobey, they'll at least pretend to let you have the last word, teen girls will just keep arguing."" I think your approach needs to veer towards the former, heavily, because you can't win with your mom."
abuse,f54ij59,t1_f53u3pv,1571983834.0,"okay, so apparently in most states there's a law that says you can get out of any lease if there's abuse involved. If you go through a hotline and tell them about the debt they should be able to help"
Autistic,eqkv5eu,t1_eqkss6t,1560131796.0,"so, I'm autistic, I've only seen this post, and I seek no quarrel, but I would look to see a picture of a real law degree not just some stock photo. #dontkillme"
abuse,eqata58,t1_eolkufr,1559939492.0,any luck on that?
abuse,eoiphoa,t1_eohrduq,1558624645.0,You're extra lucky then but I wouldn't trust her not to gaslight you in a conversation.
abuse,eohq1tr,t3_brxcd5,1558588724.0,"She's awful, you're safe, if you can cut ties and move on you win. If you need therapy, that's probably an option. and if you need to do more, you can, but it doesn't sound like you want to press charges or confront her at this time. Honestly, you got out. It sucks that her concepts aren't quite so easy to let go of, but you're away from her, so she can't win."
abuse,eohpqgy,t3_brz4vw,1558588437.0,It sounds like your Grandma's sister has the right idea. Any chance you could ask her for advice? Heck maybe even a place to stay depending on your age?
abuse,eohplsi,t3_brye1d,1558588317.0,"if that's how you vent, people need to respect that given the painful difficulty of the topic. Heck, I've handed people a letter/doc/email, and said, 'I couldn't figure out how to say it without acting like I was talking to them, so that's what I did.' one thing I do if I can is mentally (or verbally, if appropriate) start off a rant/explanation with 's/he had the audacity to/you won't believe what s/he did/you need to know a thing about him/her.'"

Autistic,eoh3a7x,t1_eogexx9,1558571873.0,that's clever. do you live on your own/choose your own meals?
Autistic,eoh38wd,t1_eog3eqd,1558571848.0,is there an adult reason it isn't up to you? and do you get the nutrients you need?
