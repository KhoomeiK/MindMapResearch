Idk something like that maybe. I'm not a expert or anything, but that's what I would do. Good luck and hope it goes alright."

My friends are starting to have beliefs that I have some kind of emotional disorder. I wouldn't say their wrong, but definitely not 100%.

If you are really going to, do it so there is no survival. Not even trying to tell you to do, just if you really are, do it so its guaranteed. I've cut myself, suffocated myself with a plastic bag, even drank toxic liquids. I now have breathing problems, like I've smoked I cough all the time. I hope u feel better man. It gets worse. If u live, don't try again ever. There is someone out there who does care. I saw the comment about the guitar. Sounds like a great idea!

depression,f71tgze,t1_f71sfyg,1573347808.0,Lost her pretty much. Guess it was only for her she was hanging out with me. Tried again and prob noticeably still here. Wish I would have died to be honest. School is stressing me the fuck out and I'm not being able to handle myself emotionally. The icing on the cake is I couldn't even see my therapist. Wished I would have died that night.
SuicideWatch,f6u8fwp,t1_f6t874f,1573159466.0,"My friends aren't 'real friend's imo. They are more just friends to ehance the pain. I'm failing school and my love life is down the drain. Being young is just like saying I have alot to live for. No I don't. I know I'm selfish, and Tbh usually I'm not. I just really don't ever want to do anything ever again. Showing I'm weak isn't doing anything with my life. I got nothing to live for. Parents friends? They couldn't care. I'm just another kid who happens to want to die but the thing is I am going to die. Become nothing so no one has to see or feel the pain.."

depression,f6nei0u,t1_f6ndiru,1572989851.0,Believe me you aren't far. Being far isnt even talking to anyone lol. You shouldnt feel bad and I'm proud u decided to even get on this. If someone else sees my other posts and they say why the fuck is he talking? Its because no one deserves pain except me. Tbh I think you should talk to others and talk to ur gf. Sounds obvious but fuck its helped me from trying again. Hell talk to anyone ur alright with. If you took the time to even read this ur helping urself. Good luck bro!
