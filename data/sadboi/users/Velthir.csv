You'll pretty much always get a larger salary increase through a new position than you would at the same company through raises and it means hopefully getting to work on things you're currently interested in.

The caveat here I guess is that it depends on your local job market too. Frequent job switches are common where I've lived (London, Amsterdam) but this may not be the case if you live somewhere with a smaller market.

Personally I worked 4.5 years as a permanent employee and now I'm a contractor and switch jobs fairly frequently (shortest contract has been 4 months, longest is 15 so far). Might consider going perm again at some point but I'm more interested in being paid a lot of money to do interesting technical things, so a management career isn't an attraction to me."

I'd guess the best option would be something like Ambien (zolpidem) or (es)zopiclone which work through completely different mechanisms. 

Doxepin or amitriptyline might be an option since they might cause additional sedation through more alpha-1 antagonism than olanzapine and maybe the extra H1 antagonism would help, but I don't know.

BipolarReddit,fa8jn1r,t3_e7yiew,1575847782.0,"It is mostly just trial and error. Eventually if you've tried enough meds you can kind of make educated guesses as to what you probably won't tolerate / won't find beneficial.


For example: I've tried a few antipsychotics and found I'm super prone to akathisia and also I don't build any tolerance to sedation. Also I'm pretty sure I've had them make me more depressed. Most of the AAPs that aren't sedating tend to be not great in regards to akathisia, so I'm not really willing to try more until I have no other choice.


Similarly I've found anything that increases serotonin causes me a lot of physical issues that don't really improve (RLS, jaw clenching, random painful leg cramps at night) and it doesn't give much mood boost and often worsens my cycling / causes awful mixed states, so I avoid SSRIs/SNRIs/non-selective MAOIs/some tricyclics.

Ruling those out reduces me to a handful of 'normal' options (lithium, antiepileptic mood stabilisers, Wellbutrin, some tricyclics) and a few off-label options.


Ended up on lamotrigine + carbamazepine + oral selegiline at a low dose. Also taking nortriptyline for pain, which I think has a small benefit for mood for me too and doesn't make me less stable. It took years to figure all this out, but it was worth it. Even now it's not quite perfect and I can still end up with mixed states if there are enough external stressors for too long, but I hold down a highly paid tech job where I still manage to outperform most 'normal' people.

My experience with Tegretol is good though, it does a good job of keeping me stable in combo with the Lamictal and has fairly minimal side effects for me. It does require blood tests once or twice a year though.

I also don't know how much it would cost given that you're uninsured or where to check since I don't live in the US. It's an old medication so I'd assume it would be cheap, but from what I've seen/heard drug prices in the US don't make much sense."
