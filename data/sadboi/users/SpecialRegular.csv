Marriage,fag04u6,t3_e8v2ou,1576036359.0,"Who says that a ‚Äúhappy ending‚Äù involves finding someone new? 

I know loneliness can be such a killer, but you have your kids in your life, casual dating isn‚Äôt too bad (and believe me, post-breakup glow up is a thing), I‚Äôm not sure about your social scene but there are apps for meeting new girl friends such as Bumble BFF. 

After I broke up with my emotionally abusive boyfriend I just wanted him back more than anything just to fill the emptiness in my life but only after time as passed that I can see clearly how miserable I was ... honestly being in a relationship so filled with uncertainty and resentment really makes YOU into a bad person yourself! You‚Äôll never know the best version of yourself that you could be outside of this relationship unless you end it. I‚Äôm guessing he is around his 40s too and as hard as it might be to hear this: 40+ is way too late for a man to so fundamentally change himself that he goes from who you‚Äôre describing to being a stable and loving husband. 

If you‚Äôre thinking about the kids, well.. do you really think it‚Äôs heathy to grow up in such a tense environment where their dad tells their mom how much he didn‚Äôt miss her etc?

For the other stuff, I would suggest getting some writing down and making some notes: even if they're shitty and not comprehensive, just the fact that you're ""doing"" something and you can actually ""see"" your work's product, should put you in the zone and alleviate some of the anxiety that's making you reluctant to start ..
