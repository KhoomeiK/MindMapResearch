There are times when new people come in and sometimes are a little intimidated of our group. Most are very nice but there have been a few who tried to cause problems and told lies and it's my job to get them the fuck out. Sometimes it sucks having to be they person and I think it's caused me not to trust anyone. I'm trying to seek therapy for it now but I don't let anyone take advantage of our friend group. They're all super nice people who just forgive the most horrible people over and over and I don't let them get walked all over.
