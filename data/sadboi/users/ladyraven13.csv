It's not like he's sticking his dick in an actual person. I agree that if they become addicted then it's a problem but until then don't worry about. 


Men pick up on insecurity and it drives them away. You're only going to achieve exactly the opposite of what you want by being insecure about this which is to drive him away. If you're so insecure that you can't handle him looking at porn then what's going to happen when he wants to talk to an actual female friend? Are you going to feel that way just because of him talking to someone with an actual vagina? 

Sure talk to him but work to get to the bottom of why you feel this way. Don't let it get in the way of your relationship. I'm not meaning to be harsh or cruel or anything it's just that I've learned a lot about relationships now that I've reached my 30s. Good luck with everything."

relationship_advice,fhrknjj,t1_fhrfoi7,1581828960.0,Sorry but I disagree. A mental illness isn't an excuse for abuse and a lot of times the promises to get help are just to get their victim to return or to keep them from leaving in the first place.

relationship_advice,fhrk6qv,t1_fhrgh3h,1581828562.0,Abuse is abuse no matter the gender of the aggressor. You're being sexist.
relationship_advice,fhrjv07,t3_f4i4g5,1581828286.0,"You didn't overreact whatsoever. What he did is still abuse even though it isn't physical. This kind of abuse usually leads to physical and accompanies the physical once that starts. I don't care what he says, DO NOT GO BACK! I'm telling you from experience that that it does get worse the longer you stay and gets worse when you go back.

You said you're pregnant. Domestic violence can start or escalate during pregnancy. Your risk of injury and even death is greater during pregnancy. He may also deliberately harm the baby by punching you in the stomach, sitting on you, etc. He may also strangle you if he hasn't done so already. 

It sounds stupid but he may be jealous of the baby and afraid that he will be replaced as your main focus. This is the behavior of a controlling partner. They can't handle not having you all to themselves. They will attempt to isolate you from your friends and family by convincing you that they don't care about you like your abuser does. This can escalate to them controlling your access to money, transportation, a phone and even basic self care supplies. Eventually they will prevent you from getting or keeping a job. No money means no escape.

Please also be aware that the most dangerous time for a victim is right after they leave their abuser. Your risk of death goes up greatly. I don't care if he promises to meet you in a public place, DO NOT GO! I can't stress this enough. Countless victims have been murdered by their former partners in public and in broad daylight. 

He will say he wants to talk things through and work on the relationship but this could be a cover for his desire to harm or even kill you. The way an abuser sees it, their victim is a possession to do what they want with and when their victim leaves, in their mind the victim had no right to leave. They basically think how dare you escape me, don't you know I own you?

Please stay gone, your life and safety as well as your baby's is not worth that POS. If you're in the U.S. call the national domestic violence hotline number at 1 800 799 SAFE. They can help you with safety planning. If you must go get your important documents, call a police escort. Don't meet him alone. Better yet, find out if you can get certified copies of them. Your local domestic violence shelter or outreach center will usually assist with the cost. 

Good luck with everything and consider yourself lucky to have gotten out this early though I would venture to guess that this isn't the first time he's done this sort of thing. Did it happen before you got married or did he change after? Sometimes they wait until after you're married to show their true colors because then they figure you're trapped. They couldn't be more wrong. In fact in your case you may even be able to get the marriage anulled since it's so early into it. I think it's much faster than a divorce.

 Either way, remember that you don't deserve to be treated like that and please don't put up with it. Hugs to you and congrats on your little one! 💜

Ediy: One more thing, that stunt he pulled with the hyperventilating and saying he was going to black out is a form of manipulation and a diversion tactic designed to take the focus off of his behavior and to get you to feel sorry for him. Don't fall for it."

She can support her fiance by saying something like ""I know that this must be hard for you but I don't know all the details so I can't comment on it."" 

OP if you read this, please stay out of it. I know you mean well but your involvement may actually be making things worse because BM probably already isn't thrilled about your existence especially if your fiance initiated the divorce. Also, most BMs aren't exactly jumping for joy at the prospect of another woman playing mommy with their kid. I know that's not your intent but a lot of women think that when their man has a kid that equals ready made family. I understand that you have your fiance's daughter's best interest at heart but the fact is that she isn't your SD until you're married. 

BM may be purposely making things difficult simply because she's bitter about their relationship ending. This happens a lot with difficult BMs. I'm not criticizing you whatsoever but I'm just making you aware of the likely reality of the situation.

relationship_advice,fhabggp,t3_f1y4jw,1581403356.0,"I'm sorry for the loss of your best friend especially in such a horrible manner. I know you think you miss your ex but you don't. You miss the good times you had with her. Make sure she faces the consequences of her actions or she may go on to do it to someone else.

What she did is a form of abuse. She killed your dog in a fit of rage. I'd venture to guess that this isn't the first time she has shown that sort of behavior. I'd be willing to bet that she has abused you in other ways as well. It doesn't have to be physical to be abuse. 

Keep her away from you and seek therapy. It's ok. You're not weak or a pussy for seeking help. Just because you're a man doesn't mean you weren't abused and it's also ok to defend yourself. Hugs."
Infidelity,fhaa8nu,t1_fhaa1q2,1581402068.0,"I'm not going to entertain your drama other than to say this. I'm sorry that happened to you but it's not ok for you to take your bitterness and anger out on other people. Please get therapy because you clearly need it like yesterday. Also, don't waste your time replying to this because at this point you're blocked.

 And btw, I didn't attack you, you attacked me first and then got mad because I pointed out where you were wrong so you proceeded to attack me again. You need to grow a thicker skin, your low self esteem is showing. In fact, I think I would venture to say you have a bit of narcissism."
abusiverelationships,fhaa1ek,t3_f229ch,1581401865.0,"This may fall under isolation but I had one particular ex who after our car broke down, he refused to get it fixed and we lived a mile from public transportation. When I asked him to look at another car he also refused to do that. 

So it was either walk 2 miles every time I needed to go somewhere, spend $10 getting back and forth between home and the bus stop or paying out the ass for a rideshare. This because he had us waaaaay tf out almost an hour from downtown so it costed at least $30 to get anywhere in a rideshare. 

So that would constantly leave me broke or close to it and he knew it. Either that or I would be so greatly inconvenienced by having to walk that far that a lot of times I wouldn't go out, thus he had me at home where he could keep me isolated right where he wanted me. I finally wised up and got sick of him and left but it wasn't easy."
abusiverelationships,fha9fap,t1_fha4yjd,1581401248.0,"He was quick to discredit her because of the very thing that happened, she reached out to warn you and he didn't want that."
Infidelity,fha92o8,t1_fha8scs,1581400909.0,"Well then it's your fault it was taken out of context. Maybe be a little clearer with your wording. Oh and while you're at it learn the difference between your and you're. Learning how to spell and learning to recognize when your context is incorrect helps a lot too, just sayin."
abusiverelationships,fha8v0m,t3_f22m4d,1581400707.0,"DO NOT drop anything! He did this to himself. If he wasn't an abuser then none of this would've happened. Don't feel bad for potentially ruining his life as you put it. His actions brought this about.

If his family threatens you or in any other way tries to make your life miserable once the court date comes about or he has been served, make sure you document all of it and block all of them. If they reach out to you on his behalf, commonly referred to as flying monkeys, make sure you let your local law enforcement agency know as this would probably be considered a violation of the restraining order. Good luck with everything."
Infidelity,fha89ap,t1_fha6xgz,1581400150.0,If you're attached to the child. Why wouldn't he be? He's been under the impression that the child is his and has raised him up to this point. What a shortsighted thing to say.
Assistance,fha7wvi,t1_fha3fxm,1581399841.0,Sad but true
relationship_advice,fha7vcx,t1_fha7jjf,1581399804.0,Well to ask someone why they stay is victim blaming
Assistance,fha0v5z,t1_fha0ave,1581394251.0,True. It's sad that there's lowlife scum out there who prey on decent people.
CasualConversation,fha0i0l,t1_fh9ynrv,1581393991.0,Right because kids lack object constancy or the ability to know that something or someone exists even though they can't see it
