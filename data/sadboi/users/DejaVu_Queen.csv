Anxiety,ezg74c6,t3_d0x2nj,1567892609.0,"When I am going through a stressed period in life I always experience morning anxiety when I am waking up. I hate it. It makes me not wanting to wake up. Anxiety wakes me up early in the morning even on my free days, on the days I am able to sleep longer, but I can't because of anxiety. Other than that, I am having night terrors, I start screaming at night and I wake up with a sore throat."

GYM,exxqny6,t1_exxqgnr,1566640953.0,"Thank you very much! Btw, I forgot to write that she did a private lesson with me for free, so that's why I feel bad about quitting the workout program even though I don't like it. I am so unsure about her motifs, I don't know does she just wants to help me or she wants the money for the workout program. She even offered to make me a program with those exercises she showed me on the private lesson."
GYM,exxogmj,t1_exxjocq,1566639803.0,Do you think I should approach her to tell her that or I should just stop going to the workout program and go to the machine and tell her that when she approaches me? I am sure she will approach me to ask me why I wasn't at the workout program. She is very intimidating and I am scared of approaching her first..
actuallesbians,exp22ml,t3_ct81dv,1566484940.0,"From my experience, majority of people who have a mindset like your friend don't ever change their minds. Even after I told them I'm a lesbian, they told me that they think homosexuality is wrong, but we can still hang out. Of course I can't hang out with someone who doesn't fully accept me as who I am, so I didn't hang out with them."
actuallesbians,exp0yme,t3_ctcm78,1566484528.0,"I would prefer that a person I'm dating doesn't smoke weed nor cigaretts. It's a dealbreaker for me because I don't like the smell of cigaretts, it makes me feel nauseous. And I would prefer they don't smoke weed because I want them to be fully present in the moment and not be influenced with THC effects. I also prefer they don't drink alcohol, I could tolerate it if they drink alcohol rarely, but if I can imagine an ideal partner they wouldn't be drinking alcohol at all."
actuallesbians,exozsn7,t3_ctbxt0,1566484077.0,"I am feeling alone, but not because of my clothing, even though I am tomboyish. I feel alone because I am not able to find people who share my values and opinions. Somehow, all the people that have crossed my life were closeminded, homofobic Christians. I have never through all of my life encountered with an openminded person with values and opinions similar to mine. My college is starting in October and I am planning to include myself in a LGBTQ+ group, also I am planning to start volunteering at the pride and pride month. Hopefully I am going to find people with similar values and opinions as mine and make friends."
AskReddit,eu688z6,t1_eu5z75j,1563494362.0,"I've spent years all over different hospitals through my education and work, met thousands of nurses and I have very bad experiences with them. I left the health field because of all of the toxic nurses I had to deal with. For example, one nurse who was the head nurse of a psychiatric department which is specialized for personality disorders, stigmatized the patients with personality disorders saying that they are just a burden for their families and that they don't deserve any help. A lot of nurses who were my teachers knew that there are nurses who beat the patients and they completely ignored that behaviour by saying that it's just how the system works and that they don't want any problems. And those same nurses who ignored these kinda stuff invite nurse students to watch movies about unethical behaviour and teach that those kinda behaviours always have to be reported, but yet they just ignore it. I am not saying that all the nurses are like this. I know that there are good ones too. I've just met a lot of bad ones."
depression,eu66ypp,t3_ceylsg,1563493535.0,"It is so nice of you for taking time and trying to figure out how to help your friend. Most people avoid people who suffer from depression. People with depression may share the same diagnosis, but every person is an unique individual, so ask her what does she need, ask her how can you help her."
depression,eu61pz3,t3_cexztm,1563490230.0,"If you are longer than 6 weeks on the antidepressant and you don't feel any change you should tell it to your psychiatrist. Not every antidepressant works on everyone, maybe your psychiatrist changes the medication which would have better effect on your depression."
actuallesbians,ettnjr4,t3_cdeeo7,1563189185.0,"I am a loner too. I had one friend from highschool, but we are no longer in contact. I realised we were never actually on the same page and I found out that he is transphobic. I am not trans, but I really care about trans people because they are a part of our community and it is even harder for trans people then for us, lesbians. I kinda regret being in that friendship. I thought he was totally different. I found out who he really is too late. He was the first person I let my walls down and share my secrets with. Sometimes it takes time to really know a person. We were friends for almost 5 years. Thinking about that friendship now, I realised that he just wanted to hang out with me when he didn't had anyone else and he never wanted to do any activities. He always fliped my words out and basicly treated me like shit. But the worst part is that I was so blind. I was so happy that someone accepts me as a lesbian, that I didn't even see all of the toxic stuff he was doing to me. I just hope that he won't out me and tell my secrets to our acquaintnaces. I don't think I am going to find people who share my values, but I just decided that I will be just working on myself and try to enjoy life alone. People constantly call me to go out with them, but they are all pretty homophobic and conservative, so I would rather be alone than be with people like that."

depression,etr8q0b,t3_cd0hjp,1563115160.0,"The worst is stigma because people are not able to see any symptoms, they can't enter our mind and see what's going on in there and on the outside everything looks fine. I even know some nurses and doctors who don't believe in functional depression, they only consider it as depression if the person is not functional which sucks."
