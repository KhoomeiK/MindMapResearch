AskReddit,fpjb9s5,t1_fpig1ke,1588662379.0,"I used to get the belt when I was a kid. 

But I guess it was more of a disciplinary thing than anything. It had an incredible psychological impact. 

Somewhere around the age of 8 or 9 I realised that they're not actually beating me. I mean it didn't even hurt.

Once they realized that it's not working they just stopped doing it instead of trying to hit harder.

Thinking of it now, if I ever have my own kids I'm not going to use the belt or any other physical punishment. It's just not that effective as some people think it is. 

If anything, it made me a better liar, cause when I was a kid  I was more concerned not to get caught and be punished than not doing whatever got me punished in the first place."
