books,fqt2fyz,t1_fqt0qup,1589627687.0,"I understand. However there clearly is a discussion of socialism/communism in the book especially in the context of Levin and his brother Nikolai. I'm quoting from the 3rd part, chapter XXXII here (pavear and volokhonsky translation, penguin classics edition) :


>""On the third day, Nikolai provoked his brother to tell him his plans again and began not only to condemn them, but deliberately to confuse them with **communism**.
'You've just taken other people's thought and distorted it, and you want to apply it where it' s inapplicable. '
' But I'm telling you, the two have nothing in common. They deny the justice of property, capital, inheritance, while I, without denying this main stimulus (Levin was disgusted with himself for using such words, but ever since he had become involved in his work, he had inadvertently begun to use non-Russian words more and more often), only want to regulate labour. '
' That's the point, that you've taken other people's thought, lopped off everything that gives it force, and want to insist that it's something new, ' said Nikolai, angrily twitching his necktie.
' But my thought has nothing in common... '
' There, ' said Nikolai Levin, with a malicious gleam in his eyes and an ironic smile, there at least there's a geometrical charm, so to speak - of clarity, of certainty. Maybe it's a utopia. But let's suppose its possible to make a tabula rasa of the whole past: there's no property, no family, and so labour gets set up. While you have nothing.... '
' Why do you confuse them? I've never been a **communist**. '
' But I have been, and I find that it's premature but reasonable, and that it has a future, like Christianity in the first centuries.
(...)
Levin suddenly became aroused at these words because in the depths of his soul he was afraid it was true - true that he wanted to balance between **communism** and the established forms and that this was hardly possible.""

Am not defending OP, if anything, this whole sections reminds me why I adore Tolstoy and his art, so removed from ideological discourse and so sincere and at heart as it always is. If this indeed is the section that spooked him off, that only tells me that great literature probably isn't his particular cup of tea.

Marquez's one hundred years of solitude has quite short sentences, time and again reading almost like a newspaper piece, whereas love in the time of cholera or autumn of the Patriarch (at the extreme end) are the opposite. of course, the former recounts the story of a large family in many generations, while the latter two are much shorter in span and specific in their subjects. so the language used reflects that."

 I would advice you to worry no longer as HIS end is near and the mindbendingly clever ways of exhibiting HIS injustice will soon find their last respite in the arms of some truly heroic human individual who will spare us of our misery and bear our cross. And yet, I can't really. Because it'd be false. Because the indignation we are made to suffer will never end. Because it is HE who has made everything, HE (or really, we should call him as he is and say IT) who sadistically punishes us for nothing. We poor lambs, we sinless, wretched, lacrimous lambs, at the hands, the merciless, bloody hands of a spiteful butcher! And no good shepherd to take us away neither! Waiting day in and day out for the massacre. For the day when we will be put on the tables of our butchers as main meal of a cold and clear spring evening, complete with appetisers and servings and Portuguese wine of finest quality and mockful laughter and gluttonous glim in the eye of our enders. And how so often one of us finds him or her dear self on that distasteful table, being pricked and stabbed by forks and table knives oozing with evil and darkness, and how powerless the rest of us are in sight of that ugly business, how compliant, how meek we become at the view of our own broken spirits, and that of our brothers and sisters...


There is no escape. No end in sight. No resolution. No way to revenge the past. No way to change the future. No way to live the present. Trapped inbetween moments, inbetween regret, indignation, hatred, anxiety, deprivity, helplessness of our spirit, weakness of our limbs, everything coming over us, crumbling, oppressing, crushing us beneath the peaceful gaze of heaven. No sister. There is no help. Nothing you've been through was just. Nothing is just. And there is no retribution. There is no peace.

music helps tho, that's how I coped for years (as well as imagining me lying on the ground dying with a kitchen knive in my abdomen and the ensuing silence and the singing of the birds and the whisper of the wind hitting my foggy window and the peace and the peace and the peace of mind and respite now and forever and forever  amen) .

Anxiety,fj9ws4s,t3_fc980v,1583161430.0,"this is a thing with anxiety. your body creates the symptoms to match the thing you fear. so if you start fearing that you're going schizo (I've had the same for a short period), you do actually start hearing sounds in (in my case this was what I fixated upon, so that's the symptom my mind recreated) flowing water or you start to hear your mom call your name in a song you're listening to or you start seeing hallucinations etc. What helped me was talking to a friend who actually had schizophrenia and she verified that I had nothing of the sort, after which I was appeased and all the hallucination symptoms simply went away.

but that's not even the only example. If you start anxiously fearing that you're getting diabetes, you start to feel dizzy (for example) after eating sugary products, even when that isn't necessarily a real symptom of diabetes (but you think it is, hence). If you start fearing that a mole in your body is actually skin cancer, then your body fills the missing parts and you start to feel weak, get tingly sensations, muscle aches etc, even when those aren't necessarily skin cancer symptoms. 

So basically, (health) anxiety can reproduce most of the physical symptoms you fear you have."

I don't know though, I don't think the name is adequate enough, It doesn't feel like what I think something called ""hyper focus"" should feel. it's more like sudden, usually inexplicable burst of interest in a thing or subject (or even person, usually famous or a historical figure maybe) which lasts for varying periods of time and wanes just as quickly and inexplicably as it fired up. my longest ones last for a few months at most, and shortest are a few hours to few days."

nowadays, I have very few people I'm comfortable with, and I'm continously interrupting them because I feel like I just have to get that thought out of me, whereas everyone else I know thinks I'm the most gentle, respectful and quiet youth ever. which in turn reinforces social anxiety because I'm sure that if they get to know how I behave normally, they will reject me (which was happened many times before)"

socialanxiety,fcmnnjn,t1_fcm7thh,1577783178.0,"Thing is, I can't convince myself I have anxiety. It feels like I'm just being extremely avoidant, I don't have too much problem in open space for example, I can interact with people enough to survive, but I can't talk to people I don't know for more than a few ninutes, my mouth gets dry quickly and I get stressed and sweaty and my voice shaky. I know these are probably clear signs, but they just don't feel enough of an impediment. On the other hand it's virtually impossible for me to enter closed, claustrophobic spaces (anywhere from campus to a small book shop). In the case of small shop, I just feel very uncomfortable, start blushing and sweating, but otherwise I'm fine, so again, kinda manageable although it's certainly not nice and makes me avoid these situations. And on campus, I feel like every single person is looking at me and judging me, so if I don't look at anyone, I can quickly pass through or by them and get to class. Once I sit down, if I don't move very much and don't talk to anyone and the teacher doesn't talk to me, I'll be mildly OK, although still very stressed.

I know I should consult some professional, but I just can't because I feel like I have so many problems that it can't be real or that they aren't serious enough. I live with my mother who's very supporting normally, but she's also physically sick and very very panicky, so I can never talk to her about my health because it crushes her and makes her even sicker. Plus, mental health is not really a thing where I live, and I don't have any friends (literally) whom I could talk to or get support. There was one girl who liked me, but I had to reject her because I was sure she'd judge me for being unmaly or something, and thst was my only interaction with a peer for the last four years since I graduated from high school.

As for serious therapy, I feel that even the therapist would make fun of me or judge me because I have a comfortable life and pretty much anything I need financially and yet here I'm bragging while there are so, so many people living in absolute hell and they would never be able to afford therapy and have to live on heroin or whatever.

socialanxiety,f9seccy,t3_e6no5f,1575590763.0,"This is what I can say: as far as I know, I have always had social anxiety but for one single period in my life when I made the most progress. That was when back in middle school our class was chosen by a local actor to prepare a play. So we were all forced to take part in it, and that experience, working with the actor, being on stage, plus having fun, was the best thing in my life even though I wasn't any good at it. That's when I first started speaking to strangers on my own without much problem. The positive effects of that experience lasted for some  three to four years afterwards, and then I had a major recession with high school and now I'm in college and it's been going downhill ever since high school basically with occasional ups.

There is a local theater now right next to my house and I know the people who run it, and they are actually giving lessons as well and God knows how much I want to be there but at this point it's simply impossible for me... I hope you can manage it."

infp,f75yetj,t1_f74wzej,1573420468.0,"She is mentally resisting it. I was the same. Plus, she's probably ridden with guilt not only because she herself thinks she's stupid for not being able to succeed on a subject most of her peers have no problem in, but also because she probably thinks you see her as stupid as well (it's not really your fault). It might be impossible to teach her the subject under pressure, as it was with me. All throughout middle and high school I always failed history, and after graduating, I caught up with it in less than a year (out of sheer personal interest) so that I could enroll in university for a history major (for which you need to pass a history exam). That's one extreme example. There are other ways to release that pressure. She might not be comfortable studying with someone she doesn't fully trust, since she's naturally introverted. She probably dreads being judged, so studying with a teacher might feel terrible. 


I don't know how you can motivate her, honestly. I don't think it's possible to motivate us for something we simply aren't interested in. The best advice I have (since I was virtually the same myself) is to try and make her feel as little threatened as possible, or make her study with someone she trusts, maybe a friend or a parent (for me, I studied best with a parent because I knew they would never judge me)..."
