A drop of light oil or silicone spray in the works  before gluing will help things too.  Reducing friction is the name of  the game.

But here's the thing. As it turns out, when we die we don't lose it all after all! I know it seems logical that if you can't remember before you were born, it would seem you didn't exist. I came to that same conclusion myself roughly 60 years ago.

Experience and research in the interim, however, have changed my mind.

1. Many things have happened that I don't remember. But I know they happened. So my memory is not an infallible indicator.
2. Some people actually DO remember before they were born.
3. Some people die, then come back. And they say that not only do we continue to exist, but we are *more* conscious than we were when here.
4. Edgar Cayce says we are eternal.
5. Most people in the world believe in reincarnation. There's still room for you to join the majority view if you want to.

Here, fwiw, is [an AW lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgjurEgqNNE) on the subjects of annihilation and reincarnation. He's logical in his way, but I confess I don't find the lecture as convincing or satisfying as points 1 through 5, for what *they're* worth.

Edit to add: Edgar Cayce said that meditation helps one to prepare for death. And I did meditate pretty much daily there for about 45 years. So if he's right (and why not?) maybe I'm ready. He also said that when we die and go home (ready or not!), it is all very very familiar. Which it would be, after a zillion years or so.

Edit again to add: So the question may arise: Why would one forget in the first place? Why drink from the River Lethe, participate in Maya? In order, they say, to focus, to concentrate on some joys, some challenges, some lessons in this life. Usually the few people who remember past lives are abnormally fey, doleful, and have trouble digging in and living this life. With the exception of realized masters, of course."

taiwan,fj2dig3,t3_faw5df,1582940886.0,"I had a similar experience in Taipei. Left my wallet in a taxi. I called the lost articles hotline and left my number. A few days later when I'd about given up, I got a call from the driver and he said that he'd drop my wallet off next time he was in the neighborhood. 

Couple days later, another call; we set up to meet at a certain intersection in a few minutes. Sure enough, here comes the cab. He hands over the wallet; I throw a red envelope into his cab and run away. Hahaha! Get home and check the wallet. Everything is still there, cash included. Faith in humanity: RESTORED."

Thanks for sharing!"

They give access to much-enlarged photos of every component, plus comments made by those who have gone before. Sometimes there are dozens of comments for one step. If you read them all, it will slow you down, but you'll be less likely to blunder, because you learn from our blunders."
NevilleGoddard,fj27rrk,t1_fj0x5c9,1582936686.0,";\^)   Still thinking of more. ""Fantastic!"" ""Super!"" ""Wonderful!"" ""Hot diggity dog!"" ""Totally copacetic!"" (Well, that last one is sort of made up—don't think I've ever said it. But maybe I'll start.)"
NevilleGoddard,fj0sccu,t3_fan7ee,1582906744.0,"Very good point. 

As it happens, I ***am*** a grandpa, (not only that, but I learned English from people who were born in the 1800s—really—Grandma born 1889, Grandpa 1891) and ""Isn't it wonderful!"" is reasonably natural for me. 

But maybe I can do better. ""Awesome!"" ""How good is that!"" ""Praise the Lord!"" ""What a blessing!"" ""Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles!"" ""Holy mackerel!"" That last one does sound dated, but I did exclaim it within the past month."

(I used to write user manuals and can't kick the habit.) Made a goof or two and had to re-do. E.G.: Installed the LCD display upside down. But no irreversible errors.
