povertyfinance,epekxjx,t1_epejo3w,1559183928.0,"My bills are roughly 700 a month, my spending is roughly 400-500 on top of that including gas, groceries, and stuff like cigarettes, a couple nights/month out with friends. I make anywhere from 1300-1500 a month working in a kitchen, but I‚Äôll be working as a server soon so the income will be better but maybe not reliable EVERY week.  I‚Äôve been using the leftover difference to pay a little more off my car or credit card when I can."
