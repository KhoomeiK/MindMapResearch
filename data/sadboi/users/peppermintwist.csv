I'm curious if Survivor AU was as popular as American Survivor how much attention he'd be getting honestly.

But he is sick so. Lol 

Shonee

Honestly, the twists of this game have saved her otherwise she'd be gone. I love her, but it's kind of ridiculous at this point.

Ugh. But she made a good move teaming up with David.
