Anxiety,fmq9a4o,t3_fq45pu,1586295284.0,"I am with you.

I got bronchitis in January, followed by a sinus infection, and it's taken a long time to fully recover. I was using a steroid inhaler which helped but also gave me heart palpitations and involves a little withdrawal as I wean off of it. Meanwhile, I too get anxiety about health things AND I believe I have GERD too. I have gone to the hospital a couple of times in the past with what turned out to be a panic attack, one of those times I was advised I might have been feeling acid reflux.

So lately I get a lot of little flutters, sometimes my chest feels tight, sometimes my airways feel constricted. I know from visiting the doctor an embarrassing number of times and from doing an X-ray that my breathing is okay, but every time I feel something amiss I spiral back into a loop of anxiety. Anxiety releases stress hormones which makes you tense up and can make you feel like you aren't breathing properly. Actually, anxiety can make you feel a crazy number of different things. A lot of people end up in the ER with their first anxiety attack because it's hard to believe you could feel such terrible things from a stress response.

It can be hard to break out of the loop, especially with something like GERD that can be hard to pinpoint. Sometimes it helps to talk myself down from a moment of stress. I have to remind myself that I am healthy, my body is stronger than I think it is, acknowledge whatever symptom I'm having, and assure myself that I would be able to recognize if I was truly experiencing a dangerous condition.

A strange-sounding tip I got which has helped sometimes is to visualize my anxiety as a little imaginary friend of some kind, which is tasked with alerting me to danger or risk but is sometimes absent-minded and triggers my stress response too frequently. I tell him that I got the message but to go have a rest. I find different coping strategies work in some moments and don't work in others, but you can't get discouraged if sometimes you aren't able to conquer your anxiety right away the way you'd like to.

Anxiety can occur frequently, including on a daily basis for a period of time. It might be triggered by a specific underlying symptom. For example, your GERD might cause a slight shortness of breath and your anxiety runs away with its stress response. Do your best to recognize this connection. Don't be mad at yourself or fight with the anxiety, but acknowledge it and try to let it settle down.

I didn't mean to make such a long response but I hope that helps. The bottom line is tons of people go through this same experience. I think it's a combination of our natural survival instinct, mixed with an overload of information about health, plus in our society (specifically right now with social isolation) we spend a lot of time independently and it's easier to feel stuck in our own heads with our concerns. If you have anyone you feel comfortable talking to about it, maybe you can do a video chat sometimes when you feel bad anxiety - just having someone there with you might make you feel like you're okay.

EDIT: Also wanted to add one more note of encouragement... Anxiety doesn't have to be forever. I started getting anxiety episodes a few years ago but they come and go, some of them are just momentary and some of them can last for a while, but inbetween I can go a long time without these feelings. Don't be afraid to mention it to a doctor. You might feel better, or if needed they might look at prescribing something to help."
explainlikeimfive,fl8vla9,t3_fn65cs,1584933433.0,"Not a full explanation here but it's important to know that human memory isn't like a computer where it's ""stored"" in one spot to be retrieved later, it's more of a chain reaction between different parts of your brain - both for forming the memory and for drawing it up.

So when a memory is ""repressed"" it's probably because a person has avoided thinking about it and withdrawn from that context so the signals their brain receives in a regular day don't trigger that chain reaction to recreate that memory."
depression,fkpo6r6,t3_fjthj0,1584414887.0,"In January I was really trying to change myself and be more social. Then I got really sick and had to spend a lot of time at home. And then this all started happening, looks like I'll be at home for the foreseeable future...

Just know a lot of people's struggle with depression and isolation is about to get a whole lot more difficult now. None of us are alone in that, even though it feels so lonely."
vancouver,fkoxce0,t3_fjlr1h,1584397083.0,"It's important people who don't need to commute right now don't do it. For all the people who will have to continue working to keep our necessary shops and services going, it will be much better for them if they can have some space and don't have to worry as much about catching something on the bus or train."
AskDocs,fkl1fln,t1_fkjorjj,1584296418.0,"Last time I saw her was March 6, mainly to get a sleep aid. She tested my temperature on every visit and found no sign of fever, and I haven't felt a fever.

Antibiotics were only for 10 days (Feb 3-13).

I have some coughing throughout the day and spitting out mucus, generally clear or sometimes whitish. I have been about the same for the past few weeks."
insomnia,fkjm1n7,t3_finyhe,1584250283.0,"You're not alone... I've been sick since January and in the past few weeks I can't stay asleep, which makes it hard to recover. Doctor gave me a gentle sleep aid called Zopiclone which definitely knocks me out but increasingly it doesn't keep me asleep. She said she would give me a mild antidepressant if the problems persist, hope to try that on Monday.

Have you been to a doctor? Sleep aids aren't ideal but if you are in a constant cycle of not sleeping and then feeling worse and then not sleeping BECAUSE you feel worse, you should reach out for some help.

Some people swear by natural sleep aids which you can easily buy at the pharmacy, if you want to try - including melatonin, valerian root, and some herbal mixtures designed for sleep and rest. I personally haven't had luck with them but medications don't work well on me in general (possibly liver function problem?). For some people they are very effective so it's worth giving one a try.

In any case you definitely aren't alone. A lot of people are going through the exact same thing."
findareddit,fkjkvra,t3_fipze4,1584249142.0,"I found a reddit for that but there was only one old post... I think it's just too early in the bell curve to say any ""good news"".

The good news where I live is that people are very understanding of the measures being taken to reduce socializing, and I've seen a lot of people on Facebook offering help to people who need it right now. The same happened through WeChat in China. I doubted that we as a society could get on board with the new normal so fast, but people are."
COVID19_support,fkj4nwr,t3_fins9d,1584236115.0,"The problem is that we are getting loaded with data piece by piece. The scientific history of researching ANYTHING involves divergent findings, including those at one extreme or the other, and then leveling it out over many years.

So we can't expect to suddenly know everything about Covid19. This unknown factor is scary, but every day that passes is another day wiser and we are seeing unprecedented collaboration. We should let projections and research inform us of the risks, but we also can't dwell on that which isn't confirmed or which hasn't already happened."
COVID19,fipcr5j,t1_fimxlm4,1582603387.0,"That's what I've been thinking too.. At this point it's spread so much in Wuhan, it's now suspicious how little we know about it outside of that area. It makes me think we are hyper-aware of cases in Wuhan, but cases arising around the world are sailing by undetected."
worldnews,fimfk6j,t1_fimd55c,1582528263.0,"Eerily, the CDC itself says: ""Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and transportation industry may also be affected. Health care providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed."" (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html)

Not to mention that healthcare workers on the front lines will start to be exhausted or fall ill, and lord knows most places already stretch their doctors and nurses too thin. Worse case scenario appears to be that COVID19 outpaces all efforts to contain or combat it, and it becomes an enormous waiting game for healthier people to wait it out while those most affected are left to die.

But I've heard a few comments from virologists that the virus seems capable of changing quickly and that it should actually become less deadly over time because it would survive better by not harming its hosts. So I'd like to think the severity of the virus will go down even as it spreads further? The only absolute truth is that no one can confidently say what will happen in a week or a month from now."
depression,fimciqe,t3_f8egtz,1582525015.0,"It's really hard but to some extent you have to make yourself preoccupied before people gravitate towards you. Not saying you ignore people or don't make time for them, but they have to see sometimes that you just came back from something, or that you're busy Thursday night, or that you have a hobby you didn't mention yet.

It's a tough cycle because it's hard to be motivated to do stuff when what you really want is for people to like you, but the moment you get sucked into your own things people suddenly get more curious about you. It's also a good way to genuinely disengage from the pursuit of approval sometimes. Again, it's an annoying paradox where in order to get the approval you want and deserve you have to stop seeking it for a moment..."

worldnews,fimbqxu,t3_f89fvt,1582524245.0,"It's deeply concerning, but people also don't all grasp that rises in case numbers are rises in confirmed or diagnosed cases. We never know how many cases *actually* exist. So even if we get the pandemic under control in the end (I hope), there's going to be a roller coaster of numbers and outbreaks for the next while.

The critical thing is whether each country actually takes their task of tracking down contacts and isolating cases seriously. It's going to be whack-a-mole for a while even in the best scenario. Of course I'm also mentally preparing for the worst scenario."
AskReddit,fimbfhr,t3_f8eaf4,1582523937.0,"Honestly, I feel like ""fake it 'til you make it"" is so true. I had to accept that no one starts of really knowing what they're doing, and in fact a lot of people who are in good roles are still just making it up as they go along.

If you accept that you aren't inherently less qualified to do something than the next person, it helps a lot. Doesn't mean you don't find your limitations or face defeat sometimes, but don't count yourself out."

Guess we'll see.. thanks for sharing your experience."

Instead I kind of domesticated myself. But you're right, I have a long term relationship under my belt while a lot of people I know around my age haven't even had one real relationship yet. Guess I need to look on the bright side no matter how much the pessimistic side lingers over me."
