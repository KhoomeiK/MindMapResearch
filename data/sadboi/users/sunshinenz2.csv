Makeup,evq72yq,t1_evq6n5g,1564687700.0,"Well, while doing your makeup it’s not super necessary to clean them til the last bristle. 
But every week or every 2 to 3 days you should clean them with soap and warm water. I like using a microfiber glove and soap to rub the brushes on my hand."

Makeup,evq4n0s,t3_ckp9hi,1564686287.0,"LISTEN, I’m 19 yr/o and I started w makeup when I was like 13 or 14, but you should consider something: WE ARE YOUNG!! You do not need a lot to look fresh and gorgeous. Forget about the foundation!!! Our skin is at its finest rn, believe me, the skin you have now well never be the same. If you’re concerned bout redness or smth like that, a soft skin tint or a concelear should work perfectly for you. 
Máscara, a brow gel and gloss should do the perfect combo for the rest of your look.

You can experiment with blushes, highlighters and eyeshadows, but always try to go for the colors that make you feel the most comfortable.

I would recommend you: -Skin tint by glossier -Mascara by glossier -Brow pencil by Anastassia -A blush by NARS (those work perfectly for me) and any gloss you’re comfortable with


You can dm me if you want to!! As young ladies, we should help our selves 
Xoxo"
Makeup,evq3om1,t3_cks88y,1564685737.0,"Brushes are important, yes. But as long as you have something to blend, another thing to apply, you are all covered, just remember to clean the residues of the last color off of your brush when using another one. 
My go-to favorite eyeshadow for an event-Party-ish is the soft glam by Anastassia. 
Considering the colors you mention (gold, red and blue) I’ll go for a brown-bronze-gold look. 

Good luck!!"

There’s no such a thing as “cultural appropriation” that you should worry about, some of us are even grateful and happy about other countries people wondering and wanting to know more about our culture! ♥️

Also, I’m from Mexico City, if y’all want some tourist advices or even a hand with getting to know where the real culture at, just let me know ✨

Hope you’re having a gr8 stay"
