Let me explain everything here people.
Yes I'm 18 and I'm in medical school, I kind of brought it up here because she cut me off financially in possibly the most expensive class. Ever. I just feel like it's pretty weird to post that here .. so I just faked my age to 20. Technically most my friends here are 20. I don't live in the USA and here you start medical school right after you got graduated from high school (which is most people are 19 by the time they got graduated and I got into sch 2 years younger :) so I graduated high school at 17 ) . I live in Indonesia and if you dont trust me you can do your own research.
my father faked my birth license and any other shit so I could start school earlier than other kids."

But my dad made a fake birth certificate, family card (idk how they call it there in the US), and also here in my place we started medical school right after we got graduated from high school (after passing tests ofc) if that made sense to you.. feel free to ask and I will try my best to explain üòÇüòÇüòÇ"

Medical school started directly after you finished high school here (after you passed the test of course) and for the how can i get into medical school in such early agw, I would say my father took care of it.

You can be 50 but if you have more than 20 years to live? It's more than enough.

Does she really think she doesn‚Äôt need to work hard bcs her parents already did? this is hilarious, does she know what will happen if her mommy and daddy die? inherited all those money but always spent them on fancy clothings,  never work from the bottom and don‚Äôt understand the value of money and how hard it is to earn it? and as the icing on the cake she has that arrogant attitude not wanting to do the ‚Äúlowly‚Äù jobs. I really think even rich kids need to start working from the bottom, it will teach a lot about money value, and give more experiences. You can never be rich and independent without starting from the bottom bcs u won‚Äôt understand the system u are working in completely if you directly work from the top. Imagine being a CEO directly without ever working as an ordinary staff. lol. Well maybe exception if you work as.. an influencer? Working isn‚Äôt as easy as education in uni when u can study and get top scores. Duh. Cut her off financially and tell her to work her ass off.

Subjectively, I think it‚Äôs too realistic. It‚Äôs too realistic and it gets.. kinda boring. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm watching a biography, because that‚Äôs the kind the world we live in, ironic. I watch movies because I wanna go to somewhere else I‚Äôve never known, exploring a new world. why would I watch a movie that accurately represents the world and society today?"

SkincareAddiction,ezjp14j,t3_d19lib,1567947970.0,"I understand so well about how u feel :( I tried many things and they broke me out and rn I have one of the worst BO i‚Äôve ever had and literally almost everyone gave me unwanted comments and opinions about my acnes lol.. maybe start from the beginning? only wash your face with water and then after at least 2 weeks if u break out, then slowly addinh up to cleanser and wait for more weeks, slowly so you can find out the culprit. I found foam cleansers are bad for acne prone and sensitive skin, based on my research (I haven‚Äôt tried it yet) you can try more gentle cleansers such as Matcha hydrating cleanser by Krave Beauty. If you don‚Äôt do any skincare and you still breakout, it‚Äôs probably something else, maybe ur foods? I found out going vegan helps some people stop getting BO (not me tho lol) or maybe it‚Äôs ur hormone? try going to a derm .. We are in this tgt :("

I know it feels really bad when people are staring and make some nasty comments but really, if it breaks u out badly i‚Äôd recommend not to wear it on daily basis. I understand how you feel but at the end of the day you have to embrace your acnes, it‚Äôs part of making them better. I‚Äôve seen your videos oho and trust me my acnes are farrr worse and people keep staring at me when i was in a skincare shop and one of the staffs even asked me if this is my usual breakout or what and the lightning so bright i see my pores there and even my fam told me the same shit about my acnes like 1000x times a day reminding me how bad they are but i shut them up by saying THEYRE NOT GOING TO HEAL OVER NIGHT so what acnes are normal people get it sometimes duh. Yah i still feel bad about my skin but part of having my good skin back is by start accepting my skin how it is, and slowly trying to fix it back.."

Work is tough and I‚Äôm sure his parents understand that well, so they want OP to have more promising job and have a better living. But they act like assholes because they don‚Äôt know how to convince OP. Some parents are just not good with the delivery, but not all of them are evils. Sometimes they know better.
