AmItheAsshole,fcva8t6,t1_fcv71bp,1577997889.0,"Wowowowo calm down.
Let me explain everything here people.
Yes I'm 18 and I'm in medical school, I kind of brought it up here because she cut me off financially in possibly the most expensive class. Ever. I just feel like it's pretty weird to post that here .. so I just faked my age to 20. Technically most my friends here are 20. I don't live in the USA and here you start medical school right after you got graduated from high school (which is most people are 19 by the time they got graduated and I got into sch 2 years younger :) so I graduated high school at 17 ) . I live in Indonesia and if you dont trust me you can do your own research.
my father faked my birth license and any other shit so I could start school earlier than other kids."

But my dad made a fake birth certificate, family card (idk how they call it there in the US), and also here in my place we started medical school right after we got graduated from high school (after passing tests ofc) if that made sense to you.. feel free to ask and I will try my best to explain 😂😂😂"

Medical school started directly after you finished high school here (after you passed the test of course) and for the how can i get into medical school in such early agw, I would say my father took care of it.

You can be 50 but if you have more than 20 years to live? It's more than enough.

These days i only use it as a concealer bcs it works better than any concealer i've ever tried and prefer medium coverage foundation on daily basis.
If you're interested, Juvia's palace I am magic foundation is also bomb."

AmItheAsshole,f7dz9yw,t3_dvhdc3,1573638069.0,"NTA, I’m only 18 and , my parents are good financially but I’m still going to say ur daughter is an asshole. Does she really think she doesn’t need to work hard bcs her parents already did? this is hilarious, does she know what will happen if her mommy and daddy die? inherited all those money but always spent them on fancy clothings,  never work from the bottom and don’t understand the value of money and how hard it is to earn it? and as the icing on the cake she has that arrogant attitude not wanting to do the “lowly” jobs. I really think even rich kids need to start working from the bottom, it will teach a lot about money value, and give more experiences. You can never be rich and independent without starting from the bottom bcs u won’t understand the system u are working in completely if you directly work from the top. Imagine being a CEO directly without ever working as an ordinary staff. lol. Well maybe exception if you work as.. an influencer? Working isn’t as easy as education in uni when u can study and get top scores. Duh. Cut her off financially and tell her to work her ass off. Maybe she will curse u now but she will be thankful in the future 🤷🏻‍♀️"
MakeupEducation,f4qvpm1,t3_dlcxyf,1571758909.0,I used to have this problem until I found Shiseido Synchro Skin Lasting Liquid Foundation. Holy. Freaking. Grail.

BatmanArkham,f32fjbp,t1_f30wcpu,1570606664.0,"Objectively, it’s really good. I’m used to DC movies with plot holes, but Joker doesn’t rush. It goes slowly, super dark, and the character depth is impressive. 
Subjectively, I think it’s too realistic. It’s too realistic and it gets.. kinda boring. It’s like I’m watching a biography, because that’s the kind the world we live in, ironic. I watch movies because I wanna go to somewhere else I’ve never known, exploring a new world. why would I watch a movie that accurately represents the world and society today?"

SkincareAddiction,ezk5azr,t1_ezjpshf,1567955133.0,I’ve read somewhere that you shouldn’t really use AHA and BHA together.. or at least on daily basis. It can irritate your already sensitive skin..
SkincareAddiction,ezjp14j,t3_d19lib,1567947970.0,"I understand so well about how u feel :( I tried many things and they broke me out and rn I have one of the worst BO i’ve ever had and literally almost everyone gave me unwanted comments and opinions about my acnes lol.. maybe start from the beginning? only wash your face with water and then after at least 2 weeks if u break out, then slowly addinh up to cleanser and wait for more weeks, slowly so you can find out the culprit. I found foam cleansers are bad for acne prone and sensitive skin, based on my research (I haven’t tried it yet) you can try more gentle cleansers such as Matcha hydrating cleanser by Krave Beauty. If you don’t do any skincare and you still breakout, it’s probably something else, maybe ur foods? I found out going vegan helps some people stop getting BO (not me tho lol) or maybe it’s ur hormone? try going to a derm .. We are in this tgt :("

mobilelegends,expcdjr,t1_exo72cl,1566488714.0,"Top global angela here, but I really think angela is extremely underrated. She’s an awesome roamer and ganker and extremely helps esp in early to mid game. She can help the tank roam and contribute in team war and she is mobile (thanks to her ulti). Idk but where I’m in no one is using lesley rn since there’s an item that currently limits max 900 dmg per hit which makes lesley such a useless mm in this meta. I think squishy is  all about positioning ur hero in war. Almost all mage and supports are squishy. I think she’s not situational she’s definitely a flexible hero and easy, just imho.

SkincareAddiction,ewu4ebf,t3_cpu9m2,1565763938.0,"Idk if it’s working on you but when i broke out badly last time and hide it with surgical mask it broke me out EVEN WORSE, it’s so damn bad i’d rather wear makeup and my skin would break out less than wearing a surgical mask. I know it feels really bad when people are staring and make some nasty comments but really, if it breaks u out badly i’d recommend not to wear it on daily basis. I understand how you feel but at the end of the day you have to embrace your acnes, it’s part of making them better. I’ve seen your videos oho and trust me my acnes are farrr worse and people keep staring at me when i was in a skincare shop and one of the staffs even asked me if this is my usual breakout or what and the lightning so bright i see my pores there and even my fam told me the same shit about my acnes like 1000x times a day reminding me how bad they are but i shut them up by saying THEYRE NOT GOING TO HEAL OVER NIGHT so what acnes are normal people get it sometimes duh. Yah i still feel bad about my skin but part of having my good skin back is by start accepting my skin how it is, and slowly trying to fix it back.."
AmItheAsshole,etp85wz,t1_eto4v4t,1563048334.0,"OP’s parents sure act like assholes but we don’t really know what’s their true intention. I like art too and I love drawing, but it’s pretty hard to gain money from drawing...The parents might want OP to be in a more promising career for his/her future. Work is tough and I’m sure his parents understand that well, so they want OP to have more promising job and have a better living. But they act like assholes because they don’t know how to convince OP. Some parents are just not good with the delivery, but not all of them are evils. Sometimes they know better. Or maybe they are just pure manipulative controlling parents? never know."
