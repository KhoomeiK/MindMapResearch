Anxiety,fp69orb,t3_fj2y1a,1588348576.0,"Wanted to share that there is an antibody test available for self-booking at Quest, with high sensitivity and specificity:

https://questdirect.questdiagnostics.com/products/covid-19-immune-response/b580e541-78a5-48a6-b17b-7bad949dcb57

There is a price tag to it, but that nay not be applicable if your doctor prescribes it to you! Nonetheless, I just wanted to point out that we’ve come a long way since the beginning of this, where testing of any sort was limited to only people who had been to Wuhan. We are *this* close to getting a handle on it!"
Anxiety,fp173gq,t1_fp0k4qt,1588226269.0,It’s such an interesting thought to think that someone might end up walking around with Tom Hanks’ plasma inside them - and they might not even end up knowing it!

Anxiety,fnlaain,t1_fnl9q18,1587049963.0,"That’s exactly how I was trying to word my reply, you’re right! It might not be that they didn’t get it, it might just mean that the other family members were asymptomatic or *very mildly* symptomatic. Asymptomatic doesn’t mean you didn’t get it! And you’re right in that the fact is we can’t know until there’s more testing and, equally as important, more antibody testing.

As of right now, it’s looking like more and more studies support the iceberg theory - that there are far, far more cases than officially recorded - and that we might be off by a factor of more than 3 to 5. Which would be great! Someone could argue that deaths are being underreported, but I would think that cases are way, way more likely to be underreported than deaths, so even accounting for that I think IFR might be way lower than we think."
Anxiety,fnl51un,t3_fj2y1a,1587047128.0,Just wanted to point out that there’s a growing body of evidence pointing to the possibility that IFR is a lot lower than originally assumed. Of course we all know that it’s more widespread than we can see - especially given the (although improving) testing situation - but it’s nice to see that there are studies that are really driving those mortality rates down!
Anxiety,fmfwjvt,t1_fmf7czt,1586036339.0,“Two weeks later!” As r/coronavirus likes to say :P (but likely less in actuality).
Anxiety,fma0b56,t1_fma069i,1585880695.0,"Yep! If the virus is going to grow exponentially, and the vast majority of people are going to recover, then you’re going to see a massive, *massive* amount of recoveries as well. Just something to keep in mind when doomers get to you."
Coronavirus,fm9z938,t1_fm90ktr,1585879975.0,"That's probably not what it is. For official recovery, you have to be mostly symptom free for at least a few days and then test negative twice, each test 24 hours apart. Tests are being allocated towards sick people right now; they're not focusing on recoveries. Moreover, there are a lot of people who will test positive, then go home and recover, and no one will think to check back in on them. Those cases won't be counted in the tally until well after the worst of it is over."
Anxiety,fm9wqui,t3_fnz5n3,1585878308.0,"Just wanted to quickly point out that over 212,000 people in the world have recovered completely - gotten past their symptoms, tested negative twice with 24 hours between tests, the whole nine yards. There are more out there that have recovered, but just haven't been tested for it yet because testing is prioritised for sick people, and this isn’t including people who recover without ever knowing they’ve had it. Over the past three days, 1k people in the US have recovered (officially) per day.

Very few media outlets will report the recoveries because it won't get clicks, but you can see the numbers for yourselves."
Anxiety,fm9w4oe,t1_fm9vbx1,1585877909.0,"You have to understand that the Spanish Flu was going on in the middle of a *world war*. People with mild symptoms stayed where they were, while people with more severe symptoms were sent home in packed transport, allowing more aggressive mutations to spread. More commonly, the opposite happens - weaker strains spread more than others. Also, if we do have a second wave, we'll be infinitely more prepared for it than we are now. Beyond that, the Spanish Flu was over a hundred years ago. Medicine has come a long, long, *long* way since then. This is not the Spanish Flu."
Anxiety,flpmtk6,t3_fnz5n3,1585363320.0,"The FDA just approved a [test](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-abbott/abbott-wins-u-s-approval-for-test-that-can-detect-coronavirus-in-minutes-idUSKBN21F014) that [takes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2020/03/27/us-approves-abbott-labs-five-minute-rapid-coronavirus-test/#759e2ea46086) only [15 minutes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-greenlights-first-covid-19-pointofcare-test-from-abbott-234449283.html) to [confirm whether you have it or not](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/abbott-launches-5-minute-covid-19-test-for-use-almost-anywhere) - this is Really Good News! Plus, it uses systems that are *already* widely distributed, and they're planning on producing it at pretty large numbers."
Anxiety,fkheb2q,t3_eupik4,1584196697.0,"Another small bit of good news - mild cases have increased by yet another point as testing continues, and we’re now at 92% mild. Remember, it’s only a few countries that are harder hit that are throwing off this number - it’s realistically to be more like South Korea’s number, at a whopping 99%. 

Also, nearly 74,000 people have recovered according to https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ ! This is amazing! While I don’t have any source for this, I think it takes a quicker time for symptoms to worsen than it does for people to recover fully and test negative twice, so the data there is also likely to improve as we give more and more people some time to test negative. Just some food for thought!"
Anxiety,fkeusut,t1_fkeul2a,1584121127.0,"Yes, that’s what I’m also saying! For people who test positive, they will have to test and confirm recovery, which will eventually show up in the data. For people who remain untested and recover though, we can’t possibly know. Thank you though - I fully agree with you!"
Anxiety,fketoul,t1_fketlbo,1584120462.0,"They will have to confirm recoveries for people who test positive as far as I’m aware - although I can’t speak for people who are untested. If there’s any source saying otherwise though, please let me know!"
Anxiety,fkethk0,t3_eupik4,1584120341.0,"Hey! I just wanted to point out that we will, within a couple of weeks if not days, see the US recovery numbers pick up (for all of you US peeps)! Bear in mind that testing is only just starting to ramp up, and there’s going to be a little lag in seeing this happen, which makes us really anxious. Also, all these school closures and work from home directives WILL make a difference, and you’re going to see that show up in the numbers as well. It’s hard because of that lag, but remember to count the good numbers as well instead of only looking at the bad."
