pics,fgxbhyk,t1_fgw8nn2,1581171042.0,"This is almost exactly my point. 300 years ago this was new. Hyper realism hadn't been tackled in an almost mathematical sense. YouTube is littered with proportion techniques, shading tutorials, ways for your brain to conquer hyper realism. And with the availability of educational resources hyper realism is no longer valued or seen as unobtainable. By no means am I saying this artist is unskilled; she has phenomenal control of craftsmanship in technique. But to address the question of why is this not considered better than the ""masters,"" the reasoning is that hyper realism is no longer ""special,"" in a sense. And while I would put forth the argument that it hasn't been special for quite some time (i.e. van gogh, picasso, pollock, even Warhol) it certainly has been watered down quite heavily with the availability of education. 

I dont have this ability of technique, but I also cant build an engine. This doesnt make building an engine special, nor does it belittle the skill required, but you and I could both agree that it's not a mastery of human expression to build an engine, rather a feat of laborious study.

Should art be subject to trending? 

It has, is, and always will be. Art is the manifestation of expression. For it to be popularly received, it has to resonate. Resonation is a product of shared experience. Some experiences are timeless like love, death, hunger. Some experiences are fully in the now, like social and geopolitical events. Based on the nature of the human condition at the time, art will be seen as either more or less accurate of a representation. Guernica is one of my favorite paintings ever. The comments on animal nature, war, mans turmoils. Would this have been nearly as powerful or understood if not for the rising events a decade before leading into world war two? 

Hyper realism is and always will be appreciated from a skill and technique level, but from a purely binary standpoint, its ability to express and address the human condition are limited only to a hyper realist composition. This style has certainly made strides in widening its expressive boundaries (i.e chuck close), but to address the question of comparison to the masters, I think lacks a fundamental misunderstanding of the statement of art. To me, it's like the same as saying ""picasso had no skill, he just painted square faces that were messed up"" or ""pollock just threw paint on canvas, my kid could do that."" Art provokes."
pics,fguwtgi,t1_fguty8q,1581131207.0,"To be frank, it's nothing new. Art has never, or rather is very rarely, about technical ability, and significantly more about understanding and representation. Being able to make something realistic is hard maybe from a skill perspective, but it takes very little mental ingenuity or heart. But to make an idea that represents a statement on a human condition - this takes a deep understanding of mankind and an ability to probe through it, digest, and force out something new. It's a risk, it has to be sat on, it has to be thought about. It has to provoke. And photo realistic technique rarely provokes because... well... we've seen it."

- reverse the sample and use it intermittently
- micro chop the sample for granular control
- use heavy delay/echo so that just a small section of the sample can be used (i.e. a 1/16 sample that fades out over 1/4 beat)
- drop the sample and use solid drum arrangement to carry the beat in certain sections

Automation is just the idea that any mixing/processing effect can be manually controlled by a human being in regards to dry/wet and gain staging. For example, I think that at the end of Hesitate when you do the little soulful scat bit, the background chord progression should have been manually automated to lower in volume and the scat should have been ridden up on the fader to allow your vocal to be a little bit more powerful and come through clean; or perhaps go a different route and leave the volume of the scat but automate the volume of the chords to go down and fade out at the exact same time the scat stops; or maybe auto hi pass the chords to give your vocal more shine over a muddy chord progression. This not only strengthens the perception of your arrangement and song structure, but also allows for presence and a natural soulful element it FEELS like you were trying to go for. The recording on that particular part is really powerful to me, and if I were to mixdown the song, I would want the listener to feel all the power of that part of the track. You can hear this in [Sunday Candy] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1h9bcrC6Q8) by Chance, at the 2:15 mark where it starts the final chorus and outro. There is two repetitions of the chorus followed by the bridge with the female vocal. There is a piano in both the chorus and its volume is automated in the bridge. The piano AND female vocal both are brought up and given heavier reverb in the bridge to bring them to the front of the mix and give them presence. The female vocal is faded back down after the bridge when the drums drop and chance comes back in to even out there presence and allow room for instrumentation in the frequency spectrum. Automation is just the listening to the track and setting the fader to have proper gain at different energy levels in the track."
makinghiphop,f89jv9g,t1_f88b382,1574374340.0,"I kinda disagree. Feels muddy to me, and the placement of the vocals feels like they were going for a clear sharp upfront no-bs vocal line, but it feels kinda lost in the mud. The bass tones really need some cleaning up imo. I also think the vocals are really fighting for pocket, like they dont really blend and sit in the mix very well sometimes. Hesitate is a really good pocket for vocals where as GMFU feels like the vocals just sit on top. They dont live in the same stereo space as the rest of the beat. I also feel like the doubling and ad-libs arent very well tackled. They feel like they were used to add thickness and variety, but the harmonics are so similar sometimes that it doesnt feel like it translates. Lastly, the one thing that really seperates pros from the hobbyists is automation, which could have HUGELY improved some of the cuts here. Mainly the more singy ones, like Watch The Waves, Hesitate, and the GMFU hooks. Some of the energy of the tracks would broadcast better if vocals were automated with the arrangement. Still better than a lot of stuff on this sub, and by no means trash, but theres still some definite area for improvement imo (in regards to mixing).

makinghiphop,f85qjx0,t1_f85i4zl,1574280878.0,"Yeah, both sides should be listening. At the end of the day the artist is the one that MOST has to live with the image the art creates, but both sides should push each other to achieve the desired results of both parties. The keyword here is *listen*, and not follow. If someone comes sincere with genuine criticism, the opposite party should step back and assess the merit of it. If they ultimately decide they disagree, then the one who bears the weight put on the success of the art should be the one with the ultimate decision, whether the opposite party disagrees or not. Both sides have the option to pull out when they feel they're vision ismt compromising the way they feel it should."

makinghiphop,f84khub,t3_dysnim,1574252495.0,You got to find a way your voice works for you. Johnny Cash talked his whole songs. You can build rap hooks like Kendrick does. You can make instrumental hooks with just a few spoken words for effects. Scratch hooks. Find a way that your voice sounds good and abuse the living fuck out of it. Nas can't sing. Jay can't sing. They just find good rap hooks and fill in the gaps with effects/singers/samples/etc.

makinghiphop,f7fyzbw,t3_dvzecx,1573690244.0,"Yeah this is generally how I do it. I have them go into a ""genre"" pack AND an instrument pack, which could or could not be divided into more subdivisions (pads vs leads or analog vs digital, etc.). I also use artist specific packs when Im looking for a very specific sound or to explore an artists ways anymore. This isnt the most efficient use of hard drive space, but it lets me have the most efficiency when trying to explore a distinct sound/style/idea I have without losing what Im going for. So Ill have the same kick in my Boi1da folder, my kick folder, and my trap folder. Ill have the same snare in my Dilla folder, my snare folder, and my boombap folder. Instruments I normally just put in a broad folder though, just because I think labeling something as a ""edm synth"" might narrow my mind when looking for sounds to manipulate. This is just my take. I use a renamer tool to keep my wav names clean and manageable, and I always ""collect all and save"" at the end of my ableton sessions to ensure the project files has all of its files for recreating the song. I have tried many organizational methods over the years, and I find this to be the best for my workflow. Thusly, I always breakdown sample packs that I download and put them in their respective divisions."

makinghiphop,f6veof1,t1_f6ul4gd,1573184084.0,"I personally love it for effects processing, havent munched used it for pitch correction, although you say that's not what you're after. The artist edition looks like it has a few quality things as well. Tbh I dont think it's a HUGE difference, but the melodic pattern tuning was what really appealed to me in particular. I will say, it didnt feel like it was a magic button out of the box. It still took a lot of learning and effort to be able to reliably get the sound and effect chain I'm looking for each individual time I pull it up. And even now I still dont feel super confident after using it for three-ish months. I get sounds I like, but not always the ones I envisioned. There's lots of tutorials, guides, and walkthroughs out there. I would suggest watching some review videos and see how people use the different technologies before making a choice. My recommendation IS EFX, but that's because it fit the role I wanted it to. Bless up though, it's all one love."

makinghiphop,f6scxzk,t1_f6sc098,1573131950.0,"Ohhhh lmao. Im currently using EFX because it has a wider range of processing effects and more granular approaches to effects chains. Looking at the different options, if ""effect"" is your main concern, Im not sure why you would even consider the others. Between the multi-effects processing and melody patterns, EFX is hand over fist better for processing then the other versions."

makinghiphop,f5ioclx,t3_dnwun6,1572216544.0,"After listening to your beats I find three or four BIG reasons your beats sound ""thin"" or ""empty"".

1. Lack of low end -> either its missing completely (only a kick) or there isnt enough distortion or midrange in the bass
2. Lack of pads/instrumentation. Chord progressions in the background, going off or on every 4 to 8 bars will really add some lushness
3. Panning isnt automated or isnt wide enough to begin with. Put the snare a little on the left, the clap a little on the right, hi hats doubled and panned a little to each side with some different eq processing to allow some dimension.
4. Drums need more swing. While some groove, your drums in general could use a little swing.
5. Bonus: Rises and falls for transitions in and out of your chorus/bridge. Give some of your time to study arrangement. Your beats will immediately feel fuller and more done. Chimes are a big memphis transition sound. Electronic rises are big for the trap scene. Brass and string rises for that old school flavor.

Study the greats, then study who they studied, and youll get there.  Personally, Kanye is a favorite for creating super lush full arrangements. Dre is also, imo, overlooked in this matter. Dre can really make a production sound full with only a handful of elements. No ID isnt preached as much as Dilla on this sub, but goddamn can that man create a full ass track."

makinghiphop,f5bt6rb,t1_f59bp2q,1572125602.0,"This \^. I personally also add other arrangements or ideas for the project at the end of the beat, but when I print the whole thing to mp3 I exclude those parts. Then, if I collab with someone that needs a little push or has ideas that need the beat to follow with, I can add those parts in at my discretion. Its kinda double edged for the producers though. You want to make lush arrangements to challenge yourself and show off, but you dont want to push people away from your beats because theyre to complex."
