Now she's working on/ through those things she's a mess because she hadn't ever started trying to work through them before. She's effectively in the teenage rebellion mindset but over ten years later, as she's trying to assert her autonomy as an adult but the controlling/ dominating force in her life won't let her. Also the emotional regulation issues that come with the territory of controlling and manipulative parents. I don't mind the crying as long as she stills works on her self growth, hoping that once she realises she can control her life herself she starts focusing that emotion somewhere else! If she stays like this I think we (the audience) won't deal with it because it's hard to have sympathy even if we have empathy for the situation!"

Asking for an assessment means a waiting list, but you could ask of your GP/ practice if they would be able to do a referral based on a phonecall or something, then you can get a head start on the waiting? You might need something to back you up, so have answers ready as to why you think it's BPD and how badly it is affecting you.

In the meantime self refer to your local talking therapies, include info about how distressed you are, highlight all the symptoms, don't know if mentioning BPD/ EUPD is the best idea here, I don't know if that would affect how they treat you - hopefully someone else can weigh in! Also speak to the crisis team - they are the closest you can get to the mental health team without a referral and they can push through assessments if needed. You should be able to call the crisis team 24/7, and then you can explain everything to them. 

I spent ages trying to get acknowledgement for how I was feeling from my GP - took literal years before I understood they could have just been referring me to the mental health team instead of telling me it's normal to want to die because some people just think like that. Sorry if the above sounds obvious or patronising, just wanted to get across that your GP is just a stepping stone to the right people for a diagnosis, and the NHS don't really like giving them out anyway, because once you have it they have to treat you for it under NICE guidelines."

It's awful that she is treating you like she is, I don't think anyone can tell you when she will stop because the only person who could know is the perpetrator. I would say you've done the right thing by trying to block them, the usual advice in things like this is don't engage and wait for them to get bored or find someone else, but I know that can feel as though you have no power in the situation.

I really hope it stops sooner rather than later, it sounds nasty and no one deserves it. It might be worse keeping records just in case it escalates. Stay safe if you can, and remember that it's not your fault this is happening to you!

BPD,fkk3hmc,t1_fkk1wfq,1584271966.0,"Oh god, I haven't seen anyone in the NHS since I got my diagnosis (I went private for my ADHD diagnosis, and got the EUPD at the same time) but based on how they treated me before (for the symptoms, but without naming the disorder, thanks guys) I don't foresee it being helpful! I guess that's just dooming it before it begins... I still think it's shitty how you've been treated, I can't see why a GP would even say that to you. So unhelpful.

Strangers are easier in a way though aren't they? You can say anything and they won't look at you different, or bring stuff up later, and on specific subs there's already a shared understanding. I think I've only met one person irl who has had a PD, and that was OC and only came up randomly - maybe there's loads of connections that have been missed where the other person would have understood.

I keep telling myself that just because my twenties haven't been what I thought, doesn't mean I can't change (still got 18 months left of them though!) - plus, now it's a good measure of whether someone is going to be a good friend, if they baulk at my lack of experience in interpersonal stuff, then it's probably not a good fit for either of us! In a lot of ways, I think I'm more ""what you see is what you get"" because I haven't been able to hide it. Maybe I'm still holding out for a fairytale, or falling back into hoping for infatuation - I almost miss falling in love with someone in the street, or in a coffee shop.

Sometimes I think that the PD makes us all have to start over, but maybe everyone else does as well - it's just another thing that we feel more acutely and struggle with that bit more?

Jewellery smithing sounds amazing though - also sounds really expensive, just for the materials alone! I work for a uni atm and it was really uncertain before with the relationship between being a student and also a customer (because of the cost), let alone now with all the closures.

At most maybe they could help you see a pattern in past behaviours, but no way can they tell you what you are capable of. Honestly, if someone said that to me, I wouldn't entertain the idea of love either. That was cruel, and unethical thing to say to you, basically confirming one of the worst fears anyone could have, let alone someone with BPD (what with all the crap out there on the internet about us, plus all our worst fears from never having had validation). I don't know how you go about unlearning that piece of (wrong, complete generalisations are always wrong!) information, but I think you should try if you feel able to? Sorry, I'm absolutely raging on your account here, that's such a shitty thing for a professional to say.

I sometimes wonder if I let people in, romantic feelings would come afterwards - I have had infatuation issues in the past, but also love - and I can tell the difference. Love takes trust for me, so that's why it's just off the table, locked in a box and the key thrown overboard. 

The only way I have successfully made a friend (out of work/ uni) was going to an art class. I signed up for ten weeks in my city, and was brave on the first day when someone spoke to me and we were amazing friends for a few years (drifted apart for completely natural reasons, she was a good egg).

BPD,fkjzetu,t1_fkiundb,1584266799.0,"It's not that - bipolar has chemical imbalances and changes in brain chemistry that can be affected by taking more chemicals (medication). Bpd is more behavioural - so medication can only be used to treat symptoms rather than the cause. So we can take anxiety meds, if we also meet the diagnostic criteria for anxiety. Same for psychosis etc.

Whilst a lot of doctors seem to see BPD as untreatable, I'm sure Big Pharma would be cashing in if they could!"

You're not weird, that just isn't the way that your brain/ mind is getting you to behave. My fear of abandonment comes through in a fear of getting close to anyone, so I avoid people and making connections, maybe this is similar for you? If you want to change it, and start forming new relationships then you might need to talk to a therapist about how you can do it safely, if there is a reason why you changed since 2015.

Or angry at the situation. Or just blank, empty. It's not always opposite emotions either, it could be anything from the whole spectrum. Because of the changeability I find that I'm not in a continuous mood for more than a day or so, but it could be a week of feeling really low, interspersed with high episodes or something else. When my bpd isn't so bad, I'm much more level, I can bring myself back to more of an equilibrium more easily.

Tbh - I don't think I can cope with just me and the world, at least not until I've got some other form of support in place,maybe therapy or something.

Wandering along , never getting below the surface with anything because that means connections and connection means hurt. Being present means feeling things for real.

I'm so scared everyone will see that I'm not a real person, I'm just a facade, a mask over an open wound. I've found that a lot of people are more than happy to just see you as a reflection - they'll just impose what they want on you and then carry on.

I've found that being like this is less harmful than other coping methods (addiction, ED etc) but long term I think we might be doing the wrong thing. There's not a lot of room for personal growth when we hardly let ourselves be people. I'm sorry I don't have any actual coping skills to offer"

Outside of that I think it makes more sense to just discuss/ identify the behaviour rather than frame it as a symptom of a disorder, because the toxicity of the action is there regardless of whether the criteria for diagnosis is met! If we only identify manipulation with having a PD or emotional instability etc, then it lets people off the hook if they don't have the other parts, when really they should be held accountable for their own behaviour. I really appreciate your comments that some of us really do try - I've seen another comment on this sub about Gigi having BPD and the commenter is active in subs that tend to categorise us as all unsaveable monsters to be avoided - so whereas your comment was thought out, theirs was just attributing any negative behaviours with someone on TV having a disorder that we can only speculate about.

It sounds as if you are being a bit unfair to him - you don't have any proof that he was stringing you along, or that his intentions weren't good at the time he was making plans. He was clear about a new boundary when he felt he had to, and needing to look after himself is a very valid, and positive thing.

It doesn't even make sense, if anything he proved that he is more than happy to let you suffer to make a point that he thinks is important, with no consideration for how you feel. Punishment like that doesn't have a place in healthy relationships, it's up to him to stay/go and for you to come with whichever and decide what you want to put up with from him in terms of support. But berating you for not cleaning the exact way he wanted it done, then using one of your worst fears (I'm guessing, as this is the BPD subreddit) against you is bullying. 

Sounds like he was angry/ upset/ annoyed and took everything out on you while also wanting to make himself look ""good"" for ""not really leaving"". Even with not returning your affection like normal, sounds like he was planning it to me. I'm so sorry he was such a dick to you, I hope it's not always like that!"

For years no one has taken it seriously with me, saying it was just social anxiety - then bam - now I'm diagnosed with agorophobia and it's even harder to access help.

Everyone I go outside I think people are staring at me, talking about me or thinking awful things. I just wish I could be invisible, which seems more realistic than getting better."

BPD,ffbx8io,t1_ffaixxj,1579785721.0,Same! I feel lucky to be in the UK where it's standard to diagnose EUPD and there are two subtypes - I find it hugely validating because I don't have an internal arguement with myself about whether or not I meet xyz because I have an automatic narrower criteria than BPD where the different presentations can sort of overshadow each other.

BPD,ff2sozg,t3_er6e2x,1579522490.0,"It sounds like talking to the right person about it couldn't be really helpful as a way to combat your illnesses attempts to invalidate you (another sneaky way it likes to come into play!!!). Having a good recommendation for someone like this is a pretty good step, my worry is always that someone will agree with me that my ""trauma"" isn't valid enough (this has happened more with GPs, MH nurses, never with a psychiatrist or psychotherapist).
My understanding is that it's the emotional invalidation as a child, along with a likely genetic component but also innate personality - say for example an underlying NDD (ADHD, ASD) - even traits of these can make you more prone to feeling the negative effects whereas someone else might not be as affecting because it causes you the pain.

I know that when I found out about BPD and did get a diagnosis it was like a missing puzzle piece. 

You are also very right about now having a route to getting better. Personally I had tried several meds for depression and CBT, all to no avail, but knowing that I can now work towards something tailored to this diagnosis is helpful because it removes the "" this is me forever and nothing will ever change"" mentality.

A professional diagnosis can sometimes be helpful to accessing government funded treatment (obviously depending where in the world you are) but many people here will relate to you strongly in that it isn't always an option available due to personal circumstances."

How about letting him know you are a bit worried it was awkward, and that you really don't want it to be, but that you had a really nice time and ask him how he feels about it?

Then based on his response (he feels good about it/ bad about it) you know whether to suggest something similar moving forward"
BPD,fezpke6,t3_eqxy7v,1579460057.0,"I had an assessment with a psychologistwhich was negative but they said I clearly has MH issues and the way they present made me the sort of person they should be seeing.

My current psychiatrist however said I clearly have autistic traits, which is common with those who have either ADHD (fairly high comorbidity with BPD) or dyslexia. 

I do see a lot of overlap with how I process the world and ASD, but not so much with ongoing special interests and things like that, it's a tough one! 

Definitely worth getting it looked into if you can!

That sounds really awful for you though, especially having a tangible bad experience rather than just an idea.

Self-care (although I hate the phrase now) for me is cleaning my teeth so I don't have to go spend ££ at the dentist again, or washing my clothes so I don't live in the same pair of grotty trackie bottoms for weeks.

BPD,fe7bmgu,t3_enwdh4,1578912496.0,"This!!! Yes, definitely. For years this was why I didn't bring up having a PD to my Drs (that and no one ever believed that my trauma was 'enough', ugh) - I have stretches of time where I feel numb, I have little to no empathy for any other human (always my animals though). Like someone else said though it's a defence mechanism. When everything is too much and I get beyond my tolerance window I withdraw and go inwards and shut off anything connection to the real world, and that involves messy people and messy emotions, but then I feel even less of a person. Other N traits like feeling manipulative and capable of controlling situations to my advantage come into my mind, but I don't know if I actually do them or possess the capability to be as cold hearted as I feel I am in that moment if that makes sense? 

I think the transient nature of it is in line with BPD, if we notice a change we highlight it to ourselves and start working it into our 'identity', again that's how it is for me. I don't want to invalidate you!
