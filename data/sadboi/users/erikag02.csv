GTAOutfitters,fqvch8v,t3_gl56ec,1589674352.0,"Hopefully if you're looking for new casual female outfits, this may create some ideas for an outfit. Or you can just make one of the ones I made. Some of these are also realistic, like something someone would probably wear in real life. 

Link for the first glitched outfit (the top comes with the outfit I picked, so that's why I don't know the name): https://youtu.be/S80A63pHjSM

Link to the glitched Deadline shoes: https://youtu.be/TppF_-JkubU

I hope they work. I tried looking for more recent and updated versions of these glitches. The Deadline shoe glitch I did required the black shorts, or if they were changed, the shoes would disappear. This was for female characters, though. The video I gave may be different. 

And the no bra glitch is easy. Just go to any clothing store, go to the counter, select ""Business Pants,"" get ""The Liberty,"" and then back out and go select any jacket or whatever you want to wear.

Apologies for forgetting an outfit. If you try it, it's still a stylist outfit. Just see what you think. (The ""Black Casuals"" are glasses, and ""Black Fashion"" is a watch.)"

Even if I'm lucky enough to get in a heist, the game starts to bug out. I usually find myself spawning in the host's arcade at the start of the heist, or the heist just doesn't load at all after players ready up.

Rarely do I get to join a heist, even with other good players, that runs smoothly.

But you can do it with friends or people you find on r/heistteams if that'll make it easier."
