It is easier to quit everything at once.  I never could until now. It is surprisingly not that hard.  Stone sober is kind of enraging me at the state of the world.  The worst was the 2nd full day off all nicotine.  Since then... physically the withdrawals are not bad.

You don't ""need"" any outside help to quit.  You will need support after you are sober to not go back to using.  But to quit... you just need to take the pain for a few days.  I just did it.  You can too.  Once your head is clearer... you will understand what help you need.  

I was you .... hundreds of times.  I am not talking down to you.  You really just need to tale the pain, find God or some deep reason to take the pain for a few days.

I am from Ottawa.  My brother has an 8th grade education and made $20 million with a ""legal"" Facebook scam company.  He bought the former Iraqi embassy in Ottawa on
The Rideau River.  Spent over a million on renos, charged it to his company.  Got $500k-1.5 million in credit card points buying Facebook ads.  He has cheated on 2 million in taxes.

He broke into 200 plus houses to support his PCP habit.  Sold drugs to make as a career for 15 years.  Until he found ""legal"" Facebook scams.    He got me thrown in a psych ward for warning his partners side of the family he was a pyschopath.  Said I was going to kidnap his kids.

At the Civic Hospital psych ward.. i met pure evil.  The doctors and staff, and a night nurse that is for certain a serial killer or will be.  They were really worried about me smoking weed?!?  

I talked down the 2 patients that were awake.  So the staff could tie them to a bed.  

I had sold my house.  To drive to the maritimes to buy a cheap house.  I was in abject poverty owning a flooded condo townhouse in Kanata, with no car or washing machine or carpets for years.

So buy a used car.  Drive East.  My armouring and back muscles are so shot from stress.  I could not drive any further than miramichi.  It took days of camping each time I drove 150 km.  And I can't have any debt, mortgage, or landlord.  I needed to buy.  So I end up in Miramichi.  

Here a Nazi was running for the PPC (he got the highest percentage of the vote in canada for the PPC besides the lesser Bernier.  He was recruiting on kijii for campaign volunteers with the email address BahamasIce@ gmail.com.  A genocidal email address.  

I emailed him.  Ron Nowlan, said I was Miramichi Antifa.  And I will make sure no one in Miramichi ever forgets he went Nazi.  He came to my house, stalked me, took photos of me, my car, my dog.  The Miramichi police came to my house twice.  The second time with 2 cop cars 4 cops and an ambulance.  He RCMP also hassled me. I literally broke not a law, and they all broke endless laws.  The cops here are Nazi's.  

After I went to church.  A lifelong atheist.  The old women in the United Church chased me out telling me to get a job.  No lie.  They were freaking because I left my bike outside the church without lockimg it first.  The cops literally are terrorizing the town on radio and in the paper.  With hourly updates.  And they literallly make 12-14 arrests a week?  So there is no real crime I guess, but they act like it is Bolivia, because addicts steal lawnmowers.  

The old people here.... are totally dead inside for the most part.  This might as well be rural Alabama.  

I found a real church that actually is solely focused on fighting meth.  Not bullshit.  And they are full of love not fear?  Hmmm funny how that works.

I am a mess.  I think I going to get a job as a breakfast cook at an i dependent hotel with a restaurant down the street.  I am a week sober off weed, beer and cigarettes and all nicotine.  

I was losing it wanting to go anarchist and make an anti-cop website and find the homeless, attach the names and faces of the cops who abused them.  Or literally make a tent city in my yard and have all the homeless here, and make a fucking mess, on
Purpose.  

But I think I will heal instead.  Get healthy this winter, in every way.  And come spring... I will have plans to take in 1 or 2 people, let them use my tools to work, recover.  Mow lawns or do simple construction.  Maybe get a relationship with Shelters in Moncton.  Take back sober recovering addicts from Miramichi, maybe I will get them a job at this hotel?

And I will start using my brain to fight the power.  In the most useful I can think of.  Proactively, not in some rage-empathy trauma.

Being sober and realizing my entire country is shit.  

Oh yeah.  I finally went to the foodbank in January.  I was getting $80 a month for being poor.  The government stopped that.  Because I owed them $270 because they got my taxes wrong.  I called the Revenue Canada snitch line on my brother a year ago.  They hung up on me.  I was too emotional.  

I hate capitalism so much.  Ads make me sick.  Notice every charity... is sponsored by evil.  Banks, Bell, Rogers.  

The government could not help me... when I went for my back pain.  I can't get a doctor, at clinics in Ontario walk in clinics have grossly i competent doctors.  But I have 10 cops, and 4 psychiatrists, an ambulance... more than that.  

Evil hates ""good"" so much.  That they will not help me, but they will spend $10's of thousands to oppress me, make the PTSD worse and truly try to make me commit suicide, on purpose.

Fuck Canada.  I made 0 dollars this year.  I gave away over $5000 to people with less than me.  Because I sold my house.  And it is unbearable to me that people are homeless and starving.  But Apparently it is totally fine to 75-80% of Canadians.  

I hate Canada.  I walked out of voting last month.  Thinking this is the last act I do as a Canadian.  But fuck that.  I should be the fucking Prime Minister.  No one has a freaking clue.

But every thing close to me, doctors, hospitals, 12 steps, rest of the family, the police.  All are literally evil from my experience.  

Futility is not what I want to spread.  But I am not going to lie.  I just read the paper here.  25% of children in my province in Canada are in Poverty.  One family in a province of less than a million people... has 10 billion dollars, owns 10% of all the land for lumber, the refinery, and the Newspapers, and gas stations.

And one Irving killed his dad and got away with it!!! All over the media.  Homeless tent bulldozed at the start of winter with no shelters.  

What justice is there?  Because I really think we meed to take their $10 billion, one way or another.  They own the media, the courts, the politicians.  They get away with killing their parents.  While people are starving and freezing, in Canada, where there is absurd wealth enough to make everyone have a decent life.  Not be hungry or cold, that is such a low bar too.

Because I Knew Jesus, and the Truth, yet I rejected Him.  Thinking (a mistake!) that having good motivations, mean anything at all, if I am not fully embracing becoming like Christ myself.  A hypocrite, lives in purgatory.  With heaven visible... behind a wall of glass.  You can see it, but you are on fire, in hell.  Knowing the possibility of heaven.  

I had to give up all my addictions, all my excuses, all my rage and past.  And I only have had a taste, a glimpse of the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth, so far.  But I am no longer in hell or purgatory.  I stopped trying to make my own path.  And listened to Jesus.  

I am so far from perfection or being like Jesus, but I am with Him, I have tasted his fruit, I have the rest of my life to keep becoming more spotless and selfless.

I look like a wounded animal to others.  Even if I feel joy, or sadness.  I am terrifying.  

In grade school.  Grade 2-4 or 5. I walked around looking at the ground.  I found dimes and quarters and took them to the office at school.  In case someone lost them and needed them.  I got them back after a week or something.

I never could talk to a girl until I was 16.  I was really good looking.  I did not want to have sex then.  I mean I did, but I did not even know them.  They just wanted ""me"" physically.

And I am a man, I was a ""boy"" until I was 25 or something.

Now my muscles are all screwed up from armouring.  I now have yoga mats and a whole bunch of things to heal myself.  I went to physio.  She would not help me.  Was terrified of me.  I was in so much pain, Literally 8,or 9 out of 10.  Every moment of everyday.  The police after me, because I called out a literally Nazi running for office.  

I am a ""man"", so I can never be the victim.  Never get empathy, from anyone.  Plus I am smarter than virtually everyone I meet.  Truly, I am.  I can't help it.  I was born premature, an addict in the womb, my mom wanted me dead before I was born.  Reality, I can finally face.  I went down to 4 pounds 11 ounces.  Spent 2 weeks in the hospital and got measles.  I should be 3 or 4 inches taller.

But somehow I was handsome and healthy and 5'6"".  With 138 IQ.  To get abused by the sociopaths in my gifted classes all through school.

Everyone is jealous of me.  Like the NIN song.  Jealous of my ""Empire of Dirt"".  I am smarter than almost anyone, shunned, so I read up on every subject, so I am also knowledgeable.  And I somehow went ""full good"" in empathy and decency, which literally is like the bible says.  You are punished for being kind and decent and generous.

I am far from perfect.  Alcohol became how I survived.  But not to ""abuse"" others.  Just to numb the pain.

Now... people see some savage animal, with body language that scares everyone.  In fight or flight or freeze or fawn all the time.  And I can't even ""fawn"" anymore.  My natural defence.  Because I am too damaged.  Not talking to anyone for months or years at a time.

And I get to ""feel"" everyone's pain.  Especially average people, that are afraid, don't know themselves, repress all their thoughts and feelings and emotions.  Most people are in as much pain as me, and won't face it, and free themselves.  I more than ready to free myself, face everything.  I am doing that.  But literally not a single human on Earth will accept me.  So I remain a wounded animal.  I could start healing hundreds of people, if anyone, anywhere would just love me and accept me a tiny bit.  But literally not a person will.  

But I persist. I found a church last Sunday.  It was ""real"" somehow.  Dedicated to help the people dying of Meth addiction in
This new city I fled to this summer to escape my abusive family.  I go again today.  This morning.  I feel this is going to save me and heal me.  These people.  I think they are going to accept me.

Who is ""tougher""?  Who is ""meek""?  And who is an indomitable force of nature?

Or who has more power?  16 year autistic girl from Sweden, who just decided the world is destroying itself, I am not going to go to school, to protest.  No real money or power.  Or Trump.  Literally evil.  Satan.

Because I realize... I have ALL the power.  And these rich, evil bastards, (like not just the elite, millions of people), have nothing.  But shame, and some ""bubble"" of their own narcissism.

I have got metaphorically punched in the face, by everyone meant to protect me... for 44 years, parents, teachers, doctors, AA sponsors, religious people, neighbours.  

Also there were many good people, that saved my life, dozens of times  they pop in for a moment, and save me and my soul, from the evil all around me.  More of them, than the persistent evil.  

Now I can't be hurt anymore, or betrayed.  I am essentially Jesus.  So are so many of us.  We need to find our strength.  Because they are living in a bubble, you pop it, they are nothing.  They have minions, but their minions live in the same bubble.  Weak. Fragile.

It isn't violence that we need.  We need to CALL OUT all evil.  Not politely either.  You see a person acting terrible to a weak person.  You call them out in public.  You say what they are doing.  The bigot in the grocery line, the assholes saying crap about the poor.

They only know shame, and the project it on the poor and helpless.  We don't deserve shame.  We can have real pride, in just surviving and being alive.  The narcs DEMAND a cult and to be worshipped.  Whether it is the President, the CEO, or some drunk father with nothing but his family to abuse.   

The shame is ALL theirs.  They make us think we are ""mentally ill"", but they are.  They act like the poor are the ""greedy"" selfish people on Welfare, but the rich are.  My taxes go to billionaires, and to kill poor people in other countries, not to some single mother trying to keep her kids from starving or freezing a few blocks away from me.

They want us to feel defeated.  But don't let them.  Please.  Fight.  With your spirit.  Think how pathetic and weak they are.  Living in lies, needing a cult.  Helpless babies without their slaves.  

Who is stronger?  Tougher? Has more balls even if they have ovaries?  It is pretty clear that the ""meek"" are a whole lot more powerful than the ""wicked"".  

We need to ""feel"" our power.  You need to.  You feel defeated.  Well I will fight for you, and encourage everyone like you, like I once was for most of my life to do the same.  Turn on the TV... look at our ""rulers"".  What pathetic jokes they are.  Think about that bad ass woman that you wrote about.  She is not weak.  She is all powerful.  

The day is coming soon, it is here.  Power and evil have gone too far, and free speech is still real.  All they have is lies.  We have the truth.  We have the real power.

Please ""feel"" it.  Don't let them defeat you mentally, it is their game.  Their only game is psychological abuse.  Because they are crazy and delusional, and we are sane and rational.  

Believe the world will soon change.  I do.  I need to.  I have hope, because I make hope.  Like a factory.

I would say... most older Americans are religious.  But not evangelical.  They aren't ""hate Christians"" but Jimmy Carter type Christians.  So a ""Trump"" is unappealing.  But they did vote Reagan. And W. instead of Democrat in large enough numbers to swing elections.  Also Obama.  

There is 2 kinds of Christians in America.  Among seniors or older folks anyway.  Racist, hate based evangelical brain washed Christians and small c Conservative Catholics and non-evangelicals.  That vote on ""values"".  (Real values not just abortion)"

religion,f8ge4ll,t3_e0lyma,1574558188.0,"Somehow I recently began to follow Jesus.  I think the ""Earth"" is essentially ""God"".  Old Testament God anyway.  

I literally had visions in August in trauma.  

I feel like ""the holy spirit"" is ""Jesus"".  Which is the Earth and all humans who have ever existed.  I think ""Jesus"" is inside every human.  It is our conscience, which is what gives us consciousness.  

Adam and Eve.  The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil.  

I think humans are ""divine"" in some way.  Part of ""God"" which beyond time, and the universe we can see.  

I think our purpose is to ALL follow Jesus.  Meaning empathy, love thy neighbour, stop sinning, stop hating.  

I think that if humans can stop being savage war mongers, that we will travel to other stars or dimensions. ""God"" the ""creator"" of the Big Bang and everything else, needs humans to exist and become ""like Gods"", for some purpose, but we are far away.  

The material world is real.  And heaven and hell exist on Earth.  If you act like Jesus, you get salvation.  Pure joy and love.  Giving yourself to everyone.  Sharing.  Greed makes you like ... well Donald Trump.  Satan.  He is living in hell.  24/7 of hate, resentment, bitterness, fear, conspiracy.  

I think he Earth/Jesus whatever... is recruiting for new prophets.  Like Greta, and others.  We are sadly at a pretty dire state of affairs, politically, economically and environmentally.  Worldwide.  

Reality is biblical.  Revelations actually happened in 70 AD.  But 30 million evangelicals and many controlling the US military... may try to make it happen, to fulfil their death cult wish.  

I think I came to Jesus and talk to him, and he communicates back, because I so fear the nut bag hate Christians causing WW3, and billions dead.  

I was an atheist all my life and not at all religious.  Now... not sure on religion, the bible has much wisdom, and Jesus... well he is my saviour.  My salvation.  Had given purpose and peace and ended my fear and endless PTSD and trauma.  

The meek will inherit the Earth.  The Earth wills it.  Look at Greta.  How do you explain her power and following?  At 16... from no where?  

Humans are a hive mind.  All of us are in cults of some sort.  It is biblical.  Look at fascism grow.  The internet was a big change, social
Media the last 5 years has shown just how much of a hive mind humans are.  

I don't care that no other Christians think this.  I follow Jesus, and read the bible.  I don't care about the cult of ""Christianity"".  I care about fixing my city, the meth problem, violent cops, crooked leaders, and no respect for the planet.  

I found a beautiful congregation though.  Really trying to fix the community.  After going to other churches and realizing the entire congregation was worshipping money or the military or king and country.

Also I hate capitalism.  You can worship God (or the Earth) or money. Not both."
CPTSD,f8fhm6l,t1_f8fetgy,1574543706.0,"We had slides.  For a slide shows instead of photos.

It was 1980.  We were at Santa's Village Amusement Park in the USA.  It was free to get in if you were under 5 years old.  My dad lied and said I was 4 years old.  I had recently turned 5.  

I said to my dad and the entrance attendant.  ""I am Five! Proud and confused about my dad.  We have money to pay $3 to get in.""

So for many years after.  We would have a slide show, for members of extended family.  And my dad would always bring up the incident, to make of me, and belittle me.  Every time, I was like.  You are cheap, a thief, a liar and you completely disrespected me.

While he kept thinking I should be ashamed of talking back to him?  Or being ""honest"".  

Every time as I grew older it felt more absurd.

I realized from 4 years old... I was parenting my parents to act properly.  Like decent people.  It is why my dad hates me.  I have 138 IQ.  Tested in school and a mental hospital (thanks dad).  My family thinks I am retarded. So stupid I can't look after myself.  That I need to be in a halfway house for people that can't look after themselves.  I got into the Harvard or Yale or Princeton of Canada.  

My dad taught that charity was selfish, just to look good.  That religion was stupid.  I believed that, maybe I still do, but Jesus... is basically me.  I have done crappy stuff.. but I act like Jesus.  They act like Satan.  

My dad was so proud of my mom's dad for giving out ""tin ears"".  My dad was too chicken to beat the shit out of his kids.  Truly.  He is the biggest coward to ever live.  I wish he punched me in the face daily.  Then at least my childhood might have made sense."

It is a force of nature.  Biblical really.  Good versus evil.  

Now it is ""information war"".  Who has the ""dirt"" on the super rich and powerful?  Putin was tops at the KGB, HW Bush ran the CIA, before he ran the GOP after Nixon... for essentially ""5 terms"".  Jeb threw Florida to W even. Reagan was an Alzheimer's husk.  

It is pedophilia.  Putin has tons of the GOP politicians on video.  Trump runs luxury hotels.  Epstein was ""made"" by the Attorney General Barr's father.  Edrogan got Trump give him Syria, and genocide the Kurds, because he has tape of the Saudi's, dismembering a Washington post journalist in the Saudi embassy in Turkey, approved by Trump's Son i  Law.

None of this is a conspiracy.  All public knowledge, reported in mass media.  

Evil is absurd, and exposed now.  My narc family... acts like that.  All narc's act like that.  

Narcissism is literally ""evil"".  

To me ""good"" is everyone that is not ""evil"".  Some ignore the world, some fight evil like Greta or people that volunteer to help food banks or the homeless.  

But ""evil"" is real, they blackmail each other.  They are all like Trump.  Every one of them.  He is just ruining it for all of them, because he has no mask.  He is ""honestly"" fully dishonest.  He does not even attempt to hide it.

Christianity,f8ew30k,t1_f8ek8dy,1574534589.0,"It just happened again today.  I am not supposed to leave my house apparently.

Today was a good day.  I thought I should go to an AA meeting.  Literally every meeting list for my city.  Won't come up.  I called.  I got through to another city.  Gave me a number.  No answer.  I looked at this meeting list before, weeks ago.  Not just one site.  All of them.

I go on kijiji and say I will pick up scrap lumber down the street.  I go with a ""new"" wheel barrow.  I burned the receipt 2 days ago.  Starting my wood stove.  The axel is broken when I get there.  250 metres away.  On a busy highway with no sidewalks or shoulders.  

It takes 3 trips.  One carrying the basically destroyed $100 wheel barrow.  I had a dolly.  

It should not have happened.  

I have a shelf with a Mug that said ""Paddle Your Own Canoe.  It was on the floor of my living room.  I noticed for a week. Could not remember putting it on the floor.  I noticed it several times.  That was last thursday or Friday.  I had an art piece above the shelf with two canoe paddles on it.  It fell in front of my eyes.  Nails in the the wall still.  I was not thumping, no wind or any reason why it would fall.  

It took me awhile, moments to connect it.  I had just gone in my kitchen.  I bought a chalk board in a frame at an antique store in July.  It says, ""Stuck in Antique Store.  (Heart).  Send Help.  (Smaller heart).  The guy in the antique store was the first person I met in this city.  Driving through... to the ocean.  To buy a house in some small city in Canada, not this one.  No ocean.  But I cof not keep driving.  My back was too injured from stress.  I could not sit in my car for 30 minutes without screaming.

I never erased the message the antique store guy had on the chalk board.  I put up a picture of the Butterfly beside it, for some reason.

Think of the double meanings of those things.  Right before I go in my living room, the paddles fall off the wall.  I had just come to Jesus.  I got on my knees.  Prayed to the cross on my wall.  A new thing.  Life long atheist.  

Radio is on CBC, Randy Bachman is doing a music show.  All the songs, relate directly to my prayers.

Listen to Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to Love"".  The video is models.  I grew up in that MTV era.  The lyrics are about Jesus.  100%.  

Then I realize on Sunday.  6 days ago. A church just outside of town is ""magnet"" to me.  I called out a ""Nazi"" running for office.  Evil.  Cops come at me.  More PTSD.  The guy lives beside the church.  I go to a new Trauma Centre.  Some young pyschologist came home to save the city where her brother suicided 10 years ago.  Meth is destroying the town. Along with the police.  Evil teams up.  

So she talks about Ray, the preacher at this Church.  I try to go.  I was living at a camp ground outside of town for almost 2 weeks.  

I kept going to the gas station on the Highway, a few hundred metres from
The church.  

I stole my real estate agents phone by accident, the day I closed on my house, he is now my next door neighbour.  I could mot drive back to his office.  They got the phone at that gas station.  I bought smokes there.   Got Subs there.  Left one I bought on a table there.  

The Church is by an a broken airport, beside horrifically bad old barracks housing where the meth addicts live.

I had never been in a ""real"" church.  Somehow... everyone there is not ""fake"".  The love, everything is real.  

And this doctor and his wife... talk about a plane crash in Alaska.  They were drawn there too.  The minister.  Had a vision to come to nowhere... from Toronto.   

I could not leave this town.  Now I am not supposed to leave my house?  I get taught humility every time I leave.  Maybe I am not supposed to be posting this. But am I not supposed to spread the ""Good News?"".  I have got pretty ""spotless"" this week.  Off cigarettes and nicotine replacement, alcohol, weed, porn, masterbation.  

I still am acting arrogant in some ways.  The way I am ""cursed"" is not being ""cursed"", it is like a gift.  I think Jesus is saying, calm down and heal.  Stop trying to cure your loneliness.  Just be alone, and don't be lonely.  

 I think it will pass.  Today was one of the best days in ... well a long time.  My escapade getting scrap wood.  Made it better.  I did not get mad.  I just took several trips.  Thinking... ok... you need more humility.  And it isn't just driving.  You are not supposed to leave your house.

Now I don't know if I should ask for a ride to church?  Maybe I need to wait another week?  Or I will be saying all this stuff there.  

I don't know.  I do know... something much bigger than me is directing me, with love, to do something.  Some path that is Jesus, not my choice, but I choose to follow that path.  Give up my will and power and let whatever is supposed to happen to me, happen."

I think ""we"", ""us"", people like us... are going to save the world.  Because we know suffering and pain, and deep empathy.  And look how ""weak"" the powers that be are?  

I have not been homeless, but treated like it.  Who is tougher? Some Senator on HGH with plastic surgery and 25 million dollars?  Or some person picking up beer cans to eat?  

Because I am pretty sure... reality is reversed.  I am finding my ""power"" in words.  In Greta, in my own understanding of Jesus.  

I thought we needed to burn this world down.  Rage against the Machine like.  But no.  We can love and hug it better.  

Narcs love anger and revenge.  They hate love and empathy.  They hate being pitied.  Yet I pity them, and am jealous of a homeless person with no masters, no boss.  

The meek will inherit the Earth.  By triple down on love, and calling out evil.  Daring it to come at us all.  

Greed is weak.  Like an addict.  I was an addict.  Now I am not.  All those in power, are weak.  Addicts to money and power.  But it is all fleeting.  Love is never fleeting.  It is a force of nature.  It grows exponentially like cancer.  Like greed does. 

Now... everyone is unhappy, most of all, those with a lot of stuff.  They crave love and meaning.  You can't but it.  You can't virtual it on Instagram.  

I don't know exactly why.  But today, I feel so empowered.  So ""full"" of Jesus and ""good"" and that my words will find a way to change things.  And the words of millions of others like you.

Because it is ""science"", yet it is irrelevant to any one person, or masses of people.  

We barely understand genes or DNA or the human brain.  

In 50 years psych meds will be looked at in this era like we look at lobotomies done in the 1950's.  

The human brain is more complicated than all of physics and chemistry, and it needs us to master both physics and chemistry to even understand it.

Yes the scientific method works.  If you stick a knife the frontal lobe... you can make people, stupid and happy and harmless.  Zombies.

You can also torture someone into PTSD.  

I mean I was in rehab in 2001.  How many ""lies"" did I hear about depression, addiction and the human brain?  Wait it is plastic and changes from outside sources?  

Wait love and connection to others cures most all human misery and mental illness and addiction?  Wow... humans knew this for thousands of years.  

Fact is we are all monkeys, who think we are Gods.  We need to study the brain, and realize that the top neurologists, psychologists and brain surgeons know essentially nothing.  

We know lithium in a water source... balances out a people, we know insulin can save someone with a broken pancreas.  But most meds.. are random discoveries, we randomly test on people, and brain scans mean crap really.  

Humans are at the stage with the brain and mental illness of digging out a log for a canoe, or wrapping vines around logs to make a raft.  But ""humans"" seem to think we are at the stage of rocket travel.  And we are going to invent Data and get warp abilities soon like in Star Trek.  Think we are at virtual reality.  When we are not even at reality.  

Love is all we have for mental illness really.  And Love is the best.  But we think ""science"" or ""technology"" or ""development"" is the answer.  All it does is make us commodities, not human.  An ""experiment"".  Turning humans into Frankenstein.  

Ironically the first real sci-fi novel, and written by a woman.  It kinda sums up the human psychology industry in 2019.  Like Orwell did our 2019 Politics.

Want to end the crap in the USA?  Don't protest Washington or impeach.  Walk millions strong into the desert, to free the 70k children in camps.  With water, food, music and tents.  No guns.  Watch all the insanity end in a week.  

ICE or Border Patrol might murder some of us.  Martyr's like Jesus.  

Revolution can't come with violence, not against those with endless military power.  Religious or not.  We all act like Jesus.  Guns and bombs, not even propaganda can stop that.  

Look at Greta.  How does she have this power and platform?  She  ever breaks her values.  Thus she has full integrity and authenticity.  

Hypocrites can't really lead any revolution.  This being a revolution against power and violence, it can't be a guerillia war.  We ALL stand against evil.  They can kill hundreds or thousands of us.... millions?  I think they crumble in the face of power.

Narcs are wimps, chicken.  We are brave.  We already suffered endlessly.  They can't even deal with their delusional narc balloon being popped.

CPTSD,f8drxod,t3_e0bhk5,1574507230.0,"I realize now... half of people with anxiety, depression, even bipolar 2 and OCD and some schizo affective diagnosis.... really just have CPTSD from horrifically abusive families... that even the victims and the medical experts can't see as horrifically abusive families.  ""Good enough"" families... that were really just good enough not to rape or beat their children.  They just did it emotionally and pyschologically.

The real mental illness is Narcissism.  It is common. 10-15% of people have it.  They cause directly the majority of ""mental illness"".  

You can see it in politics.  Of the most powerful 200 politicians in Canada and the USA.... I think
Maybe 10 of them are not evil narcissists, cruelly destroying all around them.  And many are ""progressives"".  Doctors and psychiatrists are second to politicians in prevalence of malignant narcissism.  Nearly half, not 90%.  Teachers of elementary students, therapists also high.  20-25% are evil.

And of course Capitalism itself... CEO's, bosses, wall street.  They are all pretty much evil narcs.

All of us are the victims.  Even the average person, not as destroyed as we are, but most everyone has some form of CPTSD at this point.  It literally is how they keep the revolution from happening.  We are all too shattered and confused and doubt reality itself, so evil gets to control everything.

The DSM is evil.  Written by arrogant detached narc pysch docs for the arrogant, narc pharmaceutical and health industry.

We think that human psychology is a ""science"" like chemistry or physics.  It is not.  It is politics, religion, power and money.  Not ""science"".  Not ""brain chemicals"".  It is all chasing symptoms, making up ""words"" to describe some collection of symptoms.  And to attach ""drugs"" that were just randomly created.  To find a way to market them for anything.

Psychology is all abuse.  Human suffering comes from abuse, and is treated abusively, by abusers, to justify the abuse."

I would not listen when told in many ways, to stop driving.  Rip my own door handle off.  But the emergency brake on (never do, automatic) and get stuck backing out of my driveway blocking traffic.  Endless other ways.

Yeah.  I think He made this guy hit my car.  Gently, harmlessly.... but totally by the intention of Jesus.  

I have no doubt.  If it was a one off, or a double coincidence.   But it is endless messages, and this time... it wasn't ""me"" at all.  It was a parked car, and some other guy.  A guy that needed to be driving a strange car, and do it... at that exact moment.  5 seconds earlier or later.  I never notice, or I stop him from backing into it.  

The only part of this ""I"" controlled... was watching it, and my reaction to it.  The ""incident"" wasn't ""me"" it was outside of me.  Jesus.  God.  Giving me tangible proof, so I don't drive.

You want the divine, yet reject it in arrogance.  Again, I have been doing it myself, what you are doing, in absurd ways.

I think you are somewhere like I am.  You need to listen.  Not to me.  To the holy spirit in yourself.  Because you want to listen, and reject it at the same time.  I have been doing it for months.  It is not fun.  I need to just stop fighting it.  Maybe you do too?"

They agree with the genocidal racist, apparently I am in the most bigoted riding Canada.  

It is endless.  I defend people being bullied, so the people being bullied shun me too.  But I can't not stand up for those being abused.  

But I do it to myself.  I could act more ""normal"" but I refuse to hide how I really feel.  Happy ir sad or angry or in pain.  I was made by abuse to shove all my emotions for decades.  I would rather be shunned by all than by fake or false.  

It feels like too much now.  And I did sin.  I do.  I can be angry, think violent thoughts at evil people.  I wouldn't act on it.  But I can think it.  Even after forgiving, I take it back.  My rage at injustice and murder and hate is too much sometimes.  And I was anti-Christian for many years.  I blaspheed after I knew Jesus somehow?  I doubted right up to the moment I stopped.

The whole time I was driving I was worried about driving. It could have been self fulfilling if i did it.  But someone else did, and it only seemed to be about sending me the message.

I guess the entire point of me posting this thread is whether other people have experienced miracles.  A lot of them. Connected.

Shunned by every human being on Earth.  Stone sober for days.  I was drinking and using like 1-2 grams of pot a day.  Not 24/7.  Mostly to deal with this pain.  My legs are different sizes now.  I literally can not get any help.  I tried hospitals, doctors, chiro and physio and talk therapy and churches.  Literally... they will not help.  

I am supposed to be in this pain, for some reason.  Now I can't drive.  Jesus wills it.  He made me stop in this hellish meth infested town of seniors.  Maybe the worst small city in Canada.  I could not keep driving.  Could not sit in my car for 30 minutes without screaming.  

I have to stay here.  I think to heal the town?!?  I don't know.  I was an atheist.  I don't know.  

I can't take this pain.  And now... I can't suicide either.  It wasn't my plan or anything.  But I almost can't take it anymore.  But now I believe in hell, I am in it.  I got sober.  Even off cigarettes and porn and masterbation.  ."

""I"" innately know what is right and wrong.  Often I don't know exactly why or how.  It is beyond words.  It just ""is"".  

Now I have a better relationship with myself.. by having an internal relationship With Jesus.  But it doesn't ""feel"" like I am talking to myself.  

Jesus is not just with ""me"" he is everywhere with everyone.  I am not talking to ""my personal Jesus"", it is just Jesus.  And it is on a level beyond words.  So I can misinterpret.  But I feel the ""disconnection"", if I stop listening and start thinking.

I don't even want to argue.  I started writing and thinking other things.  But this is about Your comment, not Pope Pius comment.

And how Jesus was always there with me.  And I couldn't accept it for almost my entire life.  Now I see it.

The noble quote is so clear.  Our ""consciousness"", that we got when Adam and Eve ate from Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden... gave us this gift and curse.  My dog doesn't know ""right and wrong"".  I do.  A gift from God.  The ability to sin.  Jesus was another gift from God.  He shows us how to stop sinning.  By owning the sin, feeling how it feels to betray your own conscience.  So you can give him the sin, but more importantly, do it less and less and eventually not do that sin at all.  

Now I feel it when I waste time on crap, watch baseball or do things of no value or meaning.  I realize it is a sin to waste my time.  Like stealing from myself and the world.  

When I was drinking and in trauma and selfishness, I couldn't deal with those kinds of sins.  I will never be perfect... but I have the ""nudge"" inside.  Jesus or the holy spirit.  Do you really want to watch a dystopian movie?  Get mad about politics in another country?  I keep calling myself out.  And changing.  Slower than I want to.  But I just can't take my conscience being not right anymore.  I am in fear of Jesus.  In a good way. And really trying to change, feels like a success, even with many failures.

You are ""adult"" enough in some of your thinking, but also not at all.  You deserve 10 more chances. Don't use them.  You don't know who you actually are, and no one else does either.  Don't label yourself or let anyone label you.  It is hard to get rid of a label that you choose for yourself.

 I know I was not supposed to use it again this winter.  But I did.  For a really good purpose.  Almost home I got Milk and Cream at the grocery store and watched as I saw I guy i  a car dealership rental car... parallel park... and back into the front of my car.

Thing is.  I got a bite to eat.  Before the hospital.  I read your post, and responded.

And I think it really helped you.  It helped me.  In so much pain I was screaming for the first 15 minutes I got home.  Took an advil and a naproxen and a coffee.  In a hot bath now.

God works in mysterious ways. And obvious ones.  We have each others back.  You, me, a zillion other addicts or people in trauma.  We understand each other. And I am totally clean.  I didn't want to use.  

In a week I won't feel this awful.  In a month I might feel good.  

You don't need speed.  You will stop thinkimg about it eventually.  I only did crack a few times.  Thought about it for 2 years.  Now never.  Ritalin I thought about for a year or 2.  Doing it a handful of times at 17-19 years old, 25 years ago.  It was the same as crack.  

You are going to be ok.  It is just mental.  Remember the agony after, the not sleeping and feeling rotten for days after.  Brain chemicals are burned up.  It will pass.  

Today was horrible.  Except I got hope back.  Was around 18 people in a group, and I think I helped you on Reddit too.  So the agony today, and the lesson not to drive was presented without injury or consequence.  

I hope you are ""feeling"".  Just whatever.  Sad, rage, joy.  Anything.  This brutal day was better than being high or numb or drunk or a slave to cigarettes.  My breathing is fine.  The stress sucks.. but I do not feel like I will stroke out or have a heart attack.  Just muscle pain.  Tomorrow I am going to stretch and do yoga.

Of course you also stole ALL of my emotions and happiness, tried to drive me to suicide.  Through me in a pysc ward when I sold my house to leave the city.

Let's do the math dad and mom.  You taught me nothing.  I taught you how to hide how evil you were, by correcting you and getting screamed at.  But enough times and you changed.  No bigoted talk.

My parents taught me the golden rule and greatest lesson.  Be nothing like you.  Nothing. Be like Peter Parker or Jesus or Mr Rogers, or the Keaton parents on Family Ties, or the littlest Hobo, or our family dog that got between everyone fighting to stop it.

You taught me alright.  And gave me great morals and a personality that was so distorted by abuse I could barely share my goodness with the world.

Build a new network.  One narc betrays me, ruins the whole network.  Years more in isolation.

It feels like, to me, I should trust those that have seen the worst.  They might be moody or triggered.  They might disappear because they are in trauma.  But they never truly betray me.

CPTSD,f7odq59,t1_f7o09ii,1573925746.0,"I do fully

I sin against humanity is to tell someone to call a suicide help line.  They should exist.  No human should recommend anyone call one. Because you are ""talking"" or writing to them, or in person with them.

Literally.. someone else's ""job"".  If you have no idea what to do.  Stay with them while they talk to someone trained.  Write down the possible resources they give.

Suicide help line commercials should be ""We Should not have to exist.  But we do.  We are a last resort like suicide, not how to get rid of annoying people in trauma, from bugging you"".  

""Taxes"" make sharing with others feel horrible like a burden.  ""homeless are stealing their money"".  When ""sharing"" makes you HAPPY and human.  The poorer you are, the more you share, your friends or people around you are poor.  You score a bottle, and you pass it around.

I know a person that relapses into drugs to be around people on the street.  Thinking she is an addict.  Not realizing why.  Because people have your back.  Sharing a smoke means more than a billionaire donating 10 million somewhere.  Because share out of empathy not for social approval.  And that culture police's itself.  If you are greedy or steal from your friends... you have to find a new group of friends.

Jesus was right.  About everything.  And ""Capitalism"" knows it.  They systematically take away any way people can really connect, making it ""government"" the one responsible.  So no one experiences the joy of truly sharing.

Friend depressed?  Go get help.
Litter in your town?  Call the government.  Don't pick it up yourself, or get a few others to help you.  

No.  And you feel you don't want to be a ""sucker"", a bleeding heart.  Not conform and obey absurd social rules about taking responsibility for your own life, yet the lie is ""everyone look out for themselves"", yet no human can.  Those that say that aren't living alone, need to cook, clean, deal with every emergency.  Oh you can pay someone to shovel your driveway?  Wait you have a car?  Oh so you don't walk to the grocery store with a backpack in the winter or bike. You are fat and I am strong.  Because many are very lazy, nor often those in abject poverty.  Or they would have already died."

They don't.  They are like you.  Manipulated by Satan to reject the teachings of Jesus.  So clearly in the Sermon on the Mount.

You are directly judging me.  And I am not judging you or Kanye.  I am stating both of you are not following the teachings of Jesus.

You have been misled about Jesus."
Christianity,f7nuxi9,t1_f7nrguh,1573915676.0,"I can easily see who follows Jesus and who does not.  

It has little to do with them ever mentioning Jesus or going to church.  

Kanye is not following Jesus.  Jesus is inside him and everyone. Kanye is not listening to the Christ inside of him.  But to only himself.  To serve Kanye, not the prisoners. Not Jesus.

Why do we know he did this? Why are people talking about him?  No one is talking about the people that bring sandwiches to the homeless before they go to work all day just to not be homeless.

No.  This was PR.  To steal Christ to make money.  It is disgusting.  And it makes Christianity look hypocritical and drives thousands away from Christ.  This ""news"" story.

Also we ALL deserve Jesus Love.  Only those that follow Jesus receive that which is so loving given by Jesus.  

You think I should not push you back towards the narrow path toward Jesus and allow you to promote the worship of billionaires in the name of Christ?

I think Jesus wants me to.  Part of my purpose he directly showed me.  My path."

Words have meanings. Christians are supposed to use moral suasion and words to push fellow Christians back on to the narrow path.

Am I damning her?  Or trying to correct her behaviour and the ideas being spread in this thread?

Do you understand what Jesus wants you to do?  If a neighbour hits his wife.  What do you do?  Beat him?  No.  You are not God.  Gossip about him?  No.  

You take that man.  And you talk truth to him.  Correct him.  And if he does it again.  You invite his family into your house, and leave him alone to find Jesus in his loss and pain.  So he learns and comes back to Christ.  Because he has turned his back on God."

Facebook is addictive, like opiates, or materialism.

The problem is Facebook is like Meth, opiates and nicotine combined. And everyone is affected.  Even those not using Facebook.

Facebook needs to be deleted from the entire world.  By the courts of every country.  They already enabled a genocide.  They are actively trying to cause fascism in the USA which may lead to civil war soon.  Ktills millions.

CPTSD,f7nli9r,t3_dx37q6,1573909475.0,"I was the opposite.  I was not allowed to develop any skills.  I lived with ""enough food"" .

I just was not taught how to live.  Wash myself, shave.  Was never kissed or touched.  Was not taught to cook or bake or use tools.  Used as a slave, but only at the most menial tasks.  Yelled at constantly if I has an idea thought or opinion or emotion.

Yet I was the ""parent"" of the entire family.  The only one with any morality or that cared about any of my brother or mom or dad.  The go between to get the others to get the others to do what they wanted.

I finally adulted at 25-30ish.  And my family destroyed my life and drove me to poverty and insanity.

Now at 44 I am in a new city. With no friends.  I can not figure out how to turn on my furnaces or wood stove.  I can't deal with things I could and can do.  Instruction books.  Now it is constantly being in the moment.  In fear of death.

  Every time I ask for help.  I am hurt more.  Physio, Chiro, being refused by a therapist for being too sick for them to help me.  They did not want to ""hurt me"", by talking with me.  Tortured and terrorized by the police and doctors and nurses, betrayed by help lines who send the police and ambulance because you are honest with them about how you are feeling.

Now I know.  People are not inherently bad.  But even non-horrifically abusive families are not healthy, capitalism destroys everyone, religion puts you away from god more than towards it the vast majority of the time.  

2% of people are born ""bad"", 20% are ""bad"" by puberty, 30% by 20 years old.  By 60 years old?  Over half of people are ""bad"".

And 90% act bad much of the time.  Even if it is not in their souls to do it.  Which is what keeps pushing them more cruel as they age.

This is a spiritual decline.  I ""know"" how to look after myself in every way.  ""Knowing"" and being able to do it, are different things.  I am cast out and alone, for literally being too nice, too kind, too much.  Caring.  Being honest.  Being authentic.  I was not allowed to do that.. ever.  

I got so neglected and abused... eventually I went ""Full Good"", Jesus like generosity, but not perfection.

People hate people like me.  It makes them feel bad.  My dad said this to me 100 times.  ""People that do charity are trying to make them selves look better"".  I guess it is true for some.  But if you literally love thy neighbour as thy self.  Trained to do it in abuse.  Put others first.

Now I can't put myself first.  But I put myself... equal... with all. My recovery was to give myself the ability to matter at all.  To matter.  I finally do.  And yet I can't be more important than others.  

I have failed in society because I won't put myself first.  Nor second.  I am just equal.  I care about myself a lot.  And everyone else.

If you are like this.  You end up alone. Forced to look after just yourself.  I love and need people.  No one wants love.  It makes then realize... they don't have any inside them.  Living in this culture has taken all the love away from them."

Go to endless homeless in LA with your ""laser damaged skin"".  Live with them.  Not for an hour.  A week.  

Seriously.  You will find Jesus, truly in your heart.  You will to love all your neighbour's... and realize those with nothing have more of Jesus spirit in them, than producer friends and cool hip producer people.

Those people ruin it for others like you.  For a huge number of people. Christians are evil.  

So if someone says I am a Christian, it makes many assume that means they are a bigot, in a cult or a hypocrite or literally cruel.

The problem is Christianity.  It acts like and is a business.  You can't worship god and money.  You can't worship god and yourself. You can't worship god and think only your congregation or sect has it correct.

People assume poorly of those talking about being Christians, because it is a rational thing for them to do from their life experience. 

I am with Christ.  I am just explaining why you are treated this way.


You should not talk often about being Christian.

I believe this is all over Jesus teachings.  You ACT like a Christian.  Then people will be drawn to you.  Why are you so happy and generous and free they ask?  Then you explain about being a Christian, give them the Good News. 

Not before.  Most churches think you should spread the word and not act the part.  Hypocrisy.  Why is being a hypocrite so prominent in Jesus teachings?  Why does he call out religious leaders so often? 

It is because of all I stated.  It made me believe I was an atheist for decades.  And even now.  I have no church to go to, because none follow Jesus in my town.  They follow King and country and money and feeling superior. Not Jesus, not the bible."
