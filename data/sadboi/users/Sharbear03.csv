Anxiety,fdbr8f2,t3_ej29di,1578260689.0,"I'm 32 I feel exactly like you do. I'm always exhausted by the end of my work week and I feel like all I do on off days is catch up on rest. I never get to devote time to my hobbies or interests. My plan to help counter act this is to take as many breaks as I can. I always try to get out of the office for my lunch break. Make sure I do two walks outside for 15 minutes. Midway between when I get to work and lunch then later in the day  midway between lunch and clock out time. I'm decorating my office to better fit my personality. Something loud and fun. I struggle with depression and anxiety too. My therapist suggested adding little changes to my routine to brighten my day more. Take the long way from my office to the bathroom. Walk to a restaurant on my lunch break instead of drive. Bring more nature into my office to help battle anxiety. Unfortunately, american society expects up to do the 40+ work week until we die or are lucky enough to retire. It's just not practical to do and still maintain a strong mental health or have any life outside of work. I hope you find your balance."

Marriage,f02re1c,t3_d2xd6p,1568336571.0,"My ex fiance (we were engaged for 4 years together for 6) is married in a successful marriage on their 7th year. Our families are extremely close. Not only do our kids (from our current relationships) sleep over at each other's house but we also do. Holidays are shared events and we never miss a birthday. His wife and I consider each other sisters. It would be a lie to say it wasn't awkward at first. You just have to remind yourself there is a reason he's no longer with you. The happy photos don't tell the whole story. Your marriage and wedding will belong to you. Even if somethings may appear similar, his love for you is unique."
Marriage,f02q9d5,t3_d33s4p,1568335900.0,"Chore charts, check lists, and giving ourselves small rewards. (Gold stars or anything silly to feel accomplished.) Dirty dishes are completed immediately after use. We wash our own dishes and whomever did not cook is on dish duty for the pots and pans that were cooked in. If things never pile up they're not as overwhelming."
Marriage,f02pw87,t3_d3b30e,1568335689.0,"Advice I received from my brother who is in his 6th year of marriage and has five kids. ""Babies destroy marriages"" 
Having a newborn or young child is exhausting. There's so many changes your wife is going through and she doesn't have control of most of them. Add that to sleep deprivation and things can get destructive pretty quickly. Have someone babysit and set down with your wife for a serious conversation to make sure you're on the same page. Be patient and kind. You owe it to each other and your child to put your best effort into your marriage.  As long as both parties are willing to put effort in I think it's worth it to try. However, If your conversation concludes in your wife isn't prepared or willing to try then it's better for your child that you leave so you can provide him/her the loving household they need. A broken home is always better than a toxic one."
