PUBGConsole,fqhe7ab,t1_fqhdj3b,1589375084.0,"Honestly, once I got over it not being hard-core I've not looked back. Stopped playing about 2 weeks before 7.1 as I every fucking game crashed. I tried to have a solo the other day. Truly shocking, I can't believe I ever got used to the terrible graphics, clunky movement and now to top it all off bots. Warzone has its flaw but it plays like a modern game should- I also love the lack of emphasis on loot (no point spending an entire game looting, the focus is game play). I can't believe PUBG has the nerve to charge money. The concept of the game is amazing. But so poorly executed. 

As sad as it is I will probably never play pubg again. It's a shame cause it split up the group we played with. But atleast I learnt to never buy from theae developers again.

They said its for new players but it's more likely that the player base is shrinking so much they have no choice (again I could be wrong).

However, this was my main game for a year. I personally have no desire to spend the time on this already broken game when my KD and wins are artificially boosted. For me its one less reason to play. It adds no satisfaction knowing I killed a bot."

The only thing that kept me was at the time there was only apex and fortnite. I like apex but my friends didnt want to play. We all gave warzone a try and now we cant got back to pubg. It's nice to play a game that doesn't feel like it was made in paint. I have always said pubg is a fantastic concept, a better concept than any royal which i think is why it did well despite its flaws. But ultimately the game was so purely executed everyone has had one foot out of the door. I just hope someone can make a decent hard-core battle royal as the market is open. I will miss the memories and I will feel sad for what the game could have been. But like you said, this is deserved, they had such a good idea and fucked it up. I think even if they made another game at this point they've sealed their fate with their reputation. I would never blind buy a bluehole game again."
