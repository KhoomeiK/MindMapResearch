Depending on what study you look up the #7 highest cause of divorce... is money or finances.  No money isn't everything and yes we can live on very meager means.  But guess what finances can cause a huge stressors in relationships.  So yes while you are both financially stable and yes that 10.99, 14.99, 5.99 whatever a month might not seem like much.  When you calculate out cost it actually adds up.  

One thing I notice is that you mention *""We have the lowest household income in the family.""* OP you are saying it isn't about the money but this seems like a bit of a Freudian slip.  You and SO are lower on the totem pole ""financially"" yet are expected to let everyone else piggyback on you.  Why?  Worse they are doing it behind YOU one of the financiers backs.  When it comes to relationships and money all this shit should be on the table.  If you or SO think anyone should have access to something you both are paying for then it is a decision that should be discussed by both of you.

At one year low balling, no tax's, no perks it's around $690 a year for all services listed.  And that is the pretty basic(not student, not multiple screens, etc just off the wall basic shit).

So really dig in and ask and think on why that is OP.  I want you to look at when your DH was single, he was living in that apartment and was scrounging for whatever he could get.  Ask why MIL wasn't there for him then.  Where was she when he was climbing back out of the pit.  And the biggest question, why would she be HAPPIER with her son miserable, sexless or possibly catching a disease(I mean his Ex was sleeping around) then being in a committed, health relationship.

But you aren't being ""nice"" honestly you are being used as a doormat.  They expect you to be treated like shit and just take it because well MIL does and it isn't directed at SO or FIL. (mind you if it was I wonder then how they would react?) And even if it was or is direct at FIL it sounds like he HAS gone NC and no one tells him to ""be the better person"".  No they figure if they force you to not rock the boat she won't ""take the grandkids"" or ""there son"" the reality is this is going to come to a head.  Be it on your wedding day or before.  Because honestly what happens if she does show up in a white dress.  Will you be the ""better person"" then.  Will your so call her out then?  If not what happens when you and SO have kids, she starts to be a asshole about your parenting, or bad mouths you to your own child will you have to be the better person then?  The reality is when does it stop?  When do you get to put OP first and say enough is enough.  When will your SO actually stand in solidarity with you and put YOU first?

I don't think SO is ready for marriage if he can't simple say ""stop excluding my future wife""  or ""NO I won't go to X event because you have excluded my SO AGAIN"" or even when she was ignoring you in your own home what didn't SO speak up then?  Really what he is doing when he is nice to there face then talking shit behind there back is playing on the fence.  He is playing in the middle of the argument because he wants to please both sides.  And you have let him play there.  Your SO isn't putting you first he is just trying to not rock the boat so that he keeps all sides of this JUST happy enough he doesn't have to deal with anything.

OP that says it right there .  He knows it is NOT a term of endearment he knows she is being rude.  And he wont tolerate it but has decided regardless of your feelings you must.  NOPE no apology you are NTA in opinion. You asked politely, you've asked pointedly, it is no longer a term of ""endearment"" when someone asks you to stop.  Its pure asshole for her to have continued doing it."
