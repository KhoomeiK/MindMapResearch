At the one extreme society decided death was the best treatment, at the other end society decided that the illness didn't exist.

I agree with others that you should not feel less entitled to mental health illness due to your biological or chosen gender. As a counterpoint, I have run into the ""oh, this isn't real, are you on your period"" perspective from many people. These norms make it hard to admit or share any mental illness concerns with literally anyone.

Response to allergens is a factor of both the B cells and the microenvironment in which they are activated.

The thing that is interesting here is the trafficking of IgE antibodies throughout the gut. Immunologically we talk about the gut environment as ""outside of self"" - it is primarily a bacterial habitat.
