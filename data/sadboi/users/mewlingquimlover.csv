My ex wife ( whith whom I still speak amicably ) lost her best friend of probably 30+ years a few months ago from cancer. The only thing I learned is that empathy is toxic. The people around you who are too sad about their own selfish asses can be ignored. Sympathy is ok. But often too shallow. ""Whatever I can do for you let me know"" is often bullshit but maybe you have better support than we did. 
You be you. And your life can move on. But it's still cool to be sad. Good wishes"
