Even worse, when I duo with friends it is incredibly common for people to say things like ""Stop bringing your shit gamer girlfriend into our high elo games"". I'm not even a fucking woman. The sexism is real."

Shifts in life don't magically happen overnight. But day by day tend to those dogs, go outside, do anything that makes you feel even the slightest tinge of happiness. You got this.

P.S. Minecraft is awesome and a totally legit reason to want to live. I'm pretty sure there are many people who spend the majority of their life in minecraft anyways."
