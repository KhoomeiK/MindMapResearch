I wish them the best and hope they seek treatment or find help, but it sounds like you are much better off. I know I am slow to trust and open up due to past issues and I was especially bad unmedicated but this sounds much more severe. a good partner won't point out differences and attempt to twist them as faults in such ways as you've stated. this sounds like your ex was very defensive for whatever reason, wether they realized it or not.

could have been manic behavior."
