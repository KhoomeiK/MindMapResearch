I fought for years and refused to accept that I could be bi polar. I looked down on it and just thought ""that can't happen to me"". I hit the deepest low I've had last year I was in a 4 month depression and I had no will to go on and was barely functioning at work and my relationship was suffering. I took the steps to go to a psychiatrist and I started meds 6 months ago. It was about 2-3 months of cycling meds into my system and dealing with the side affects. I was avidly against medication because I viewed them as a deficiency in my character and self worth. I had to shift out of the negative mindset and give it a chance. 6 months later the meds have not changed me I am just balanced better. Less mood swings, less mania, less depression. It just cut the rollercoaster swings into a more steady ride. I cannot imagine life off meds at this point. I am less volatile and consistent. Its not the absolute answer this is an ongoing battle I'll deal with the rest of my life and it frustrates me to no end at times, but it's my reality and yours as well. Keep positive as best you can and I wish you the best on this journey of bi polar curveballs."
