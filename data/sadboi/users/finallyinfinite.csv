You could see their relationship falling apart; they could only connect intimately through anger, they were fighting more, and it became clear that neither of them was going to be what the other needed them to be.  They aren't compatible as a couple.  They have different love languages (example: Mr PB gives Diane these giant surprises, which Diane constantly expresses she hates).  

Their relationship weakened during the campaign.  After, things seemed like they could get better, but Diane was already so emotionally drained from trying to hold out in this relationship that has become toxic to both of them.  The Belle Room was just the straw that broke the camel's back, reminding her of all the ways they just didn't work together, and she was tired of trying to hang on and make it work.  Their marriage had run its course, and in order to be happy, they needed to split and live their own lives."
