unpopularopinion,forubdj,t3_g95ynu,1588018642.0,"Honestly with the current narrative, that isn't an unpopular opinion. If it was, that would mean that non binary people would be a lot more accepted than they are. It's not that hard to see that non binary people are often discriminated against or at the very least, not recognized. An opinion that's actually unpopular is that it's not really anyone else's business whether someone is non binary/trans/whatever."
