He was a one-time rehearsal pianist for Barbra Streisand, and the Kimball piano I have that dates to roughly 1906 was a gift from him when I got married in 2002.)

I'm again looking for a sponsor, but in lieu of one I elect never to fly far from a meeting whether it is online or in person. I recommend you hit as many meetings as you can and odds are greater than not you'll find one without looking.

I can't register Republican in good faith ever anymore, Democrat is getting harder if the party is going to put the candidate they want regardless of the vote. And, the most recent Libertarian of note decided to publicly embarrass an entire movement based on shrinking the waste from government, lowering taxes to a level for the sustainability of the military and providing services that 50 individual state government plans would make a mess of. 

The disingenuous nature of the two party system is that someone can make a run on popularity alone and win and call themselves anything they care to. It's when it counts that the valor of the party is molded. Allowing Donald Trump, a fairweather guy who likes being popular out of ego. He knew that with all the shit he's said over the years that the DNC would totally crap themselves. We were at a unique time in history, where people recognized the fact that they felt the system was broken and the government threatened white superiority. By dog whistling at all his followers, he has been able to get responses from highly improbable conspiracy theories, racist language and behavior, been able to almost normalize corruption in front of the people and to play the victim when people resist policies and hate and the side effects of running a campaign of stochastic terror where you can say someone ought to receive consequences and then it happens because people are so blind to what America is, was, and should be when they dress up in their Republican costume.

As an (actually independent) acting Libertarian, I believe that at the end of the day that no matter how many pennies you collected from the country that those pennies are used to seek to serve the rule of law, prevent inter-branch collusion, and encourage Americans to be the best they can be, not hiding from chemtrails in their basement obsessing over the ""deep state"" because of QAnon theories. 

I think far too many are putting party over country and pettiness over discussion and calls for censorship that endanger free expression. In an effort to polarize the people, the latest campaign takes the cake in this arena. I have seen people on both sides either encouraging or tacitly condoning behavior that does not belong in the White House or the Congress.

People need to know that the Soylent Green is people, and they need to take their fucking rights and use them to work toward a government that acknowledges that both parties want success and how to compromise and not elect a dangerous man with Stephen Miller in his ear and drafting his immigration policy.  It was never intended to be a border security update, it became a culture war where the GOP had the upper hand and has made immigration a toxic issue and constantly fighting based on sound bites and bullshit.

Granted, there are things that the DNC has done that I don't agree with and they really need to define themselves better to be the party of people who understand and accept that people are different and they are bad or good on their own merits, not 100% due to the whims of a politico.

There is a path forward. Party lines will buffer any real chances at reform. But, if people can put their ego aside we would realize how much we are alike and not try and play one against the other.

I realize this is a pipe dream, but without all the hubristic BS we are two main and a couple of offshoot political parties that are all about making America as good as possible. The definition of an American and the amount one makes is being highly skewed by a group that uses difference and fear of different to convince its followers that a member of the other party is trying to destroy life as you know it through blatantly false ads those who support trump WANT to believe. Because, at this point, the facts are gaining on them and they are afraid to admit what might happen because of retaliation and the need to belong. 

I remember when I was younger, there were two parties and both wanted to make America good and had different ideas but could coexist. It wasn't perfect, but it wasn't banal and wrong 24/7/365.

AskReddit,f67vqvm,t1_f66jke4,1572723299.0,"My follow up is long and meant to be informative. The summary of what is below is that the DEA is causing more illegal drug use that cannot then be tracked, and that the crackdown has led to the most popular form of ""heroin"" being about 2% raw heroin and the rest typically baby laxatives and fentanyl. 

I have become a very outspoken activist for compassionate care and fighting the drop of pain as a vital sign and punishing people who have been treated without diversion of drugs or misuse for years and even decades by forcing them to take a dose not strong enough to allow them to function.

I really don't think that people not directly affected realize how many people's lives were destroyed by the DEA's zeal to make progress in the opioid epidemic by taking medication away from the only people who will obey the law. Everywhere the DEA went, suicide and the physical and financial toll of the result of entire practices losing their prescribing privileges followed. Consequently, the demand for narcotics on the black market went up and sadly it is risking more lives as counterfeit pills are often nothing more than fentanyl or carfentanyl (50 and 100x stronger than morphine respectively) mixed with a binder, and the stuff is so potent that dosing in America is typically transdermal or through the gums and swallowed as a ""lollipop"" which allows for a slow release of the drug as simply handling the drug carelessly can result in toxicity if it gets in open wounds or damp skin, or if you inhale enough stirred up powder depending on how much fentanyl there is. Baby laxatives typically used to cut it do not, obviously, kill you and there are a lot of stories about officers who ""had to be given Narcan [naloxone, a nasal spray or injection that prevents the ų-opioid receptor in the brain from binding with drugs, used to reverse overdose]"" when in reality the number of cases that involved actual harm to K9 dog or handler are extremely rare but the number of cases where they gave them Narcan as a publicity stunt [doesn't hurt you if you aren't overdosing, so no harm in dosing officers for the sake of furthering public hysteria and misinformation] but while there are risks associated with it, the real lottery is the lack of care taken when cutting the drug and the use of carfentanyl [read: large animal tranquilizer/anaesthetic] which when mistaken for its half as potent sibling results in widespread overdose. The people selling you drugs do not (usually) operate in laboratory conditions to create an evenly distributed level of drug and therefore they can wind up selling someone a weak batch and killing someone else. It's used because it is so strong dosing is in micrograms therapeutically and therefore you can get a hell of a lot more of it in the country without detection.

Tl;DR: Drugs need to be decriminalized and addiction addressed as a public health problem. The current Spanish Inquisition of intimidation and forced abandonment of care without a system to treat addiction without stigmatizing those who have become dependent or addicted does more harm than good."
AskReddit,f66brp8,t1_f657duh,1572709369.0,"Yeah. People are paying attention to the *illegal* opioid crisis and they are blind to the opioid crisis that started in the wake of the 2016 CDC guidelines designed to set best practices and NOT LAWS which the DEA then used to raid people who did not largely comply, including the foremost pain physician, Forrest Tennant, MD who refused to comply because as he wrote for the American Academy of Pain Medicine it constituted malpractice and abandonment of care in violation of the Hippocratic Oath.

The DEA served search warrants on his California clinic and home, suspended his prescription privileges, and sent people in both chronic and *terminal cancer* pain into free-fall. Most of the particularly bad cases wound up in the ER either due to severe withdrawal (including people who could not get their morphine pumps refilled) or intentional overdose. Everywhere the DEA arrested or suspended a doctor for having an overdose death or not complying fast enough, patients died, and over half to two-thirds of new users of heroin and pills that are illegally sourced are people cut off from pain mgmt. 

Fortunately, the availability of over-the-counter Naloxone has decreased deaths. But, the myopic and singular focus of the task force created to fight the opioid crisis has allowed methamphetamine use to skyrocket and continues to force patients into a choice of crippling pain and withdrawal, illicit drugs, or suicide as pain medicine retreats and the ""clarification"" earlier this year about the fact that the CDC ""never meant for this to happen"" comes too late for many, and has not reversed a policy machine that has a chilling effect on manufacturing, distribution, and prescribing. 

Pain medication was overprescribed. People were lax in controls. All drugs of abuse will likely end up on the black market because a legal prescription for 60mg Oxycontin ER tamper resistant is over $1200. There's huge profit potential in drugs. There needed to be controls, but the one size fits all approach to it is BS. It's killing more people and creating more illicit drug use and ruining lives.
