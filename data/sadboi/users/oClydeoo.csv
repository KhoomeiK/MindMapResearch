if you by any chance unlock hela out of a premium or mega orb, invest hard in her shes an amazing standalone character, same goes for vision and minnerva.

A.I.M is another great option, they can do raids, villain campagin, nexus campaign, DD1 and DD2, and the main benefit they let you beat vilain campagin so you can farm hela.

work on agardians as soon you possibly can, they will beat mystic campagin for you and does great in war.

in my case on my alt account the arena shard is dominated by asgardians with a mix of captain marvel becuse everyone in there got hela and CM for free, so arena meta depends very much on what was given to the playerbase at the time"

make sure you check where in the arena you got placed, if you're in the high 1000's i'd honestly recomend starting over account tryinh to land in the early 100's or within 1000, if you do that you can compete for tons of more arena credit and power cores(the most valueable resource)

a good early arena team could look something like rhino/the thing/(whatever good pull you get out of premium or megas)/mordo/scarlet. Or go with thr defenders for simplicity but don't give them to much love as u'll wanna switch to any other team as soon as possible wether it be (asgardians, guardians, sinister six, AIM, etc)

If you instead want to work on a good raid team but will do only okay to decent in arena, guardians is a great go to but rocket can take a while to farm so i'd get on it as soon as possible."
