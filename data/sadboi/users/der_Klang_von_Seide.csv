I‚Äôm going look into every study you‚Äôve sent me (holy shit, thank you! You‚Äôre speaking my language) tomorrow before seeing my PCP. 

Sildenafil being successfully tested for neuropathy is awesome. And id imagine really helpful as well if the genital/sexual aspect of Cauda Equina advances for me. So far it‚Äôs begun in my inner thighs and urinary/bowel mainly, not genital yet. But I‚Äôm trying to hustle and heal this as efficiently as I can now that I know. It seems so specific to sciatica, which I‚Äôve lived with for ten years now. 

I‚Äôm very curious as to what the NCTV vs punch biopsy will show for me. Over a year ago my psychiatrist had wanted me to see a neurologist because of my pain/weakness and tremors but my PCP said it wasn‚Äôt necessary.

My rheumatologist dismissed the joint, limb and back pain, diagnosed me with osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia after poking me in the forearm and neglecting to test me for the genetic diseases I requested because I was ‚Äútoo young‚Äù. I can pop every joint on my body, and it doesn‚Äôt sound good. Ankylosing Spondylitis runs in our family so I tried to be thorough. 

I suppose what‚Äôs hard has been being told I am ‚Äúperfectly healthy‚Äù despite being politely persistent about the level of pain, fatigue and confusion I‚Äôm in. I‚Äôve been able to ignore the pain more over the years because of the increasing numbness and maladaptive coping mechanisms of caring for other‚Äôs needs to ignore my own. 

The first person to take it seriously was my PT. I feels good to be studied and listened to for the first time in a year, but now I‚Äôm confused as shit in terms of injury vs genetic disease vs. fibromyalgia vs. neuropathy etc etc. 

I‚Äôd guess this is a fairly common reason some of us have joined r/peptides anyway.

Nerve pain was coursing from the back of my neck, down my arm, down the left side of my body. I had a hard time holding my tea. 

I suck at Salsa dancing but half avoided it because I couldn‚Äôt step outside of the pain. I tried really hard. The live band hurt. The lights hurt. The multiple conversations hurt. And there wasn‚Äôt even flourescent lighting or bad music! It was all completely lovely and relaxed socially! The crowd wasn‚Äôt even that big! 

My partner asked me if I was ready to go (early) because he could see me trying to hide how miserable I was and because he felt spent socially. We came home to cuddle then read and do homework in quiet. 

I was genuinely upset when we got home. I didn‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúI want my life back‚Äù but I did say, ‚ÄúI miss doing the stuff I love‚Äù. I hated how I couldn‚Äôt truly enjoy that friends wedding. It meant a lot to me. 

I feel you. Side bar, I wish the chronic pain didn‚Äôt come with light and sound sensitivity (for me). It feels egregious and just an absurd addition to the pain. It‚Äôs bullshit. 

It‚Äôs so isolating keeping pain like that to yourself. And it sucks even more when something like Costco feels like it wins.  Or leaving the wedding. Or putting away the dishes.

We split all domestic duties evenly anyway, but I so appreciate when he asks me, ‚ÄúMay I do X task and you do Y task?‚Äù X task usually requires me getting up and down off the floor a lot (really really hard for me) or lifting awkward/kinda heavy things but Y task is pretty gentle and he knows it won‚Äôt hurt me too much. Both are time consuming, but he always opts for the harder one depending on my pain level. *I like that I don‚Äôt have to ask for help, he just takes initiative.* I like that he doesn‚Äôt enable me to do *nothing* when I‚Äôm having a flare, because pretty often we both know that me getting up and wiggling my body around at least a little will distract me from the pain at least for a little while and lift me out of the pain-depression ever so slightly. 

Also‚Äî when my pain is that full throttle, widespread nerve + joint + muscular, can‚Äôt think clearly, can‚Äôt comprehend how this is my regular existence at 29 yrs‚Äî we‚Äôll be purposefully silly. 

I started being intentionally loud and goofy and dead pan yelling existential nonsense this past year during my flare ups because I felt like I was LOSING MY MIND from the pain and I didn‚Äôt want to keep being an asshole and shutting down to him. So I just start yelling (in a silly way) and making crazy noises until he comes into bed and acts like a dork with me. 

Sometimes Im saying the silly things through tears but being silly DOES help me. And when I don‚Äôt know if I can be silly he‚Äôll start the game and if I‚Äôm just too fatigued he‚Äôll climb into wherever with me and hold me and have soft convo time. Or he‚Äôll take the extra naps with me. Or he‚Äôll give me space. He just rocks. 

He lets me be and he knows the pain *isn‚Äôt* about him. It just *is*, and life is kinder when we both just accept it and make the best of it. 

Also he wakes me up at 5am to take my meds then puts me back to sleep. So when I actually wake up at 7am I feel pretty good and functional instead of confused, deliriously fatigued and in pain. He brings me coffee. 

When I‚Äôm unknowingly moaning in pain in my sleep I usually reach for the worst area (my knees generally) and he puts my NSAID gel on them. 

He gives me space to be angry when I need to just feel angry about my body. He knows I‚Äôll try the guided meditation later. 

He tells me he loves me and that I‚Äôm a badass every damn day."

socialwork,fj2wlbg,t3_fb39ii,1582956599.0,"I‚Äôm a CPSS so I don‚Äôt have the degree you do, but I can tell you that the Motivational Interviewing, Wellness Action Recovery Plan (WRAP), and Mindful Self-Compassion certifications are all really useful for building self reliance & self advocacy in your clients. 

MI will help ease and empower them to make their decisions themselves. With soft questions that masquerade as your guidance, but *not* your advice. 

WRAP is a series of knowledge or triggers to direct actions they can take when they want to use. To have a documented plan their parents or friends know about is def a tool they can learn. 

Look for youth respite centers, CPSS in your area who are on the younger side, check for drug diversion programs and see if they have any for youth. 

A gentle reminder that although this may be debated, AA & NA have a success rate of 5-10%. Rehab alone isn‚Äôt too great either. Medicated-Assisted Treatment saves lives and gives people the option to find a middle ground during their recovery. Maybe they‚Äôll always need MAT, maybe not. 

The biggest thing is to give these kids a quality of life that makes sense to them right now. So you might have to meet them in the middle. There‚Äôs only so much they‚Äôre in control of compared to an adult. Take your *time* before making suggestions. They‚Äôre stubborn as hell, they‚Äôre teens. They shut down soooo quick. But they also open up faster than adults. As long as you‚Äôre genuine. 

If none of all the many many things in your toolbox work, I really would recommend reaching out to a CPSS that‚Äôs qualified and relevant to their lived experience. I say this because I am one but also because it really does work. It‚Äôs so empowering for kids to see someone on their level not just live, but thrive through it.

AskReddit,fimxzgy,t3_f8eaf4,1582550592.0,"Honestly? For me, drugs. Serious habit changes. Setting small, actionable goals. 

I say the drug bit jokingly but also seriously. I‚Äôd been going years with diagnosed but unmedicated inattentive-ADHD. I‚Äôd been dealing with chronic pain and fatigue and was trying to mitigate it all on my own. I wasn‚Äôt in therapy. I was working a physically and emotionally exhausting job that left me with almost nothing to give back to myself at the end of the day. I couldn‚Äôt think clearly about anything, let alone myself or my own goals. I left this job and pursued a career in mental health and haven‚Äôt looked back. 

So, I‚Äôm a big believer in therapy and a clinical assessment of your needs first. If therapy or medication can help, you deserve that! 

BUT meds and someone to talk to aren‚Äôt enough. You need actionable goals. When I went back on medications I decided to start doing A LOT of different things to change my habits, and to get the most out of my medications by learning better organization and adaptive coping mechanisms on my own. This is what worked for me:

***Write everything down, all the time. It‚Äôs weird at first if you don‚Äôt write but it‚Äôs really enjoyable once you get into the habit.***

1. Buy a GOOD planner. And a journal. Go to the office supple store and look through a bunch of em, see which one is right for YOU. Write everything in it, and mirror everything digitally and also put it in your phone. Look at it every day, morning and night. 

2. Post-It ‚Äúextra sticky‚Äù notes. Don‚Äôt buy the cheap ones. These will stick to damn near everything. Break them up and keep them around the house with a pen RIGHT next to it. This may result in hundreds of sticky notes in your home but deal with it. It‚Äôs better than losing the thought entirely. Every week, collect your notes and dump them all in the journal/planner. 

3. Keep a small notebook or journal in your pocket/bag. Let this be where you ‚Äúdump‚Äù all the random thoughts. Just so there‚Äôs always something on your body to capture a thought or need. 

4. Buy fun pens. Markers. Highlighters. Whatever. Different colors can stimulate your brain to separate the crazy amount of notes you now have. Get pastel highlighters if you have visual sensory issues (this is what I do, as well as pastel legal pads). 


5. Buy a wristwatch if you don‚Äôt have one. If your hands are wet in sinks etc all day at work, buy a pocket watch or wear it on your bicep. Look at this instead of your phone. Just look at your phone less in general. 

6. **This is the ‚Äúfun‚Äù one** ‚Äî ***Now, brainwash yourself by utilizing the power of the internet***. 

6a.) Change your Facebook/reddit/whatever feed to the things that actionably serve you. Want to learn someone new, or more about shit you don‚Äôt understand but need to? **Join that group.** Budgeting, organization, habit building, minimalism, positive-reinforcement communities (that applaud the small forward movements, not shame you into not getting enough shit done), affordable grocery shopping + cooking/meal prep (do you have an ALDI near you?), all things finance, understanding the bullshit that is your private health insurance(if you‚Äôre in America), time management, workouts, meditation, whatever. Now! **unfollow all the stuff that makes your mind feel slushy, depressed & crappy.** Keep the funny and wholesome stuff that makes you laugh, smile.

6b.) Search for and build YouTube playlists on organizational stuff. I found searching for ‚ÄúADHD organization‚Äù worked best for me. Just search and collect whatever methods work best for you. Search in your podcast app and start saving those too! Even if you can‚Äôt give your full attention to something just let it play in the background, you‚Äôre absorbing way more than you think. Similarly, turn off the TV or an infinite Netflix stream, gaming, whatever. Do these things in intentional times. Use apps to time and signal to you if you‚Äôre infinitely scrolling. Put down your phone more, pick it up less. Keep it on vibrate and set alerts only to the people and things you need to be attentive to. 

7.) If you drink, start to wonder what your life would be like if you drank less. If drinking is so embedded into your work or social groups and you don‚Äôt really even think about it cause it‚Äôs the default activity, go out with them 1-2 times less per week. Fill this time with aforementioned YouTube videos/podcasts. Improve your diet a little. Get a water bottle. Go for a walk or do something little and approachable that you love/used to love. Listen to that album on headphones you‚Äôve been meaning to. Move your body. 

If you can manage to take out a lot of the clutter, little by little, you can give yourself time to dream again. Sit in absolute quiet every day for a lil while. Keep the journal and pen near you. See what comes up. Seriously, give yourself time to dream. If you can start to remember or discover the things that really (**really really**) make you happy you can start the process of getting in touch with them again through small, actionable goals. 

Ask for help if you need it. Ask a friend to help you declutter your room if it‚Äôs too overwhelming to do on your own. Go to the friends who do indeed have their shit together and ask them how they do it. If you need help finding a therapist, ask the friend that‚Äôs in therapy. Ask reddit, ask us again, just keep asking!! Be kind to yourself. And patient. 

If all this fails go listen to a bunch of Jocko Willink and kick your ass with him lol. That‚Äôs worked for me too. 

Good luck to you!! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

I do manage to stretch everyday for at least 30 minutes. 

I‚Äôve read that I should start with 15 minutes of very light strength activity. Stop, rest. Check in with body. See if I can identify where the pain is the worst. If I can do 15 minutes more, awesome. If I can do 5, that‚Äôs great too.

However. The ‚ÄúOpioid Crisis‚Äù is about so much more than simply the number of deaths. A more appropriate term which I would like us to use as we move forward as a society is ‚ÄúThe Overdose Epidemic‚Äù. 

Yes, in many of those deaths the cause was poly-substance use, and that is largely underreported in media, for sketchy and/or ‚Äúmanufactured‚Äù reasoning. I am **not** for the war on drugs. But manufacturing consent on a concept given to the public does not need to be all or nothing. A true uptick in poly-substance overdoses that include an opioid still mean that the opioid has been added to the mix of substances at a higher rate. What would be **better** than the media focusing on ‚Äúthe opioid crisis‚Äù would obviously be **harm reduction** and education on **safe use of substances** for all people. 

Bullshit government policies that restricted access to painkillers created this problem in terms of overdoses related to heroin/fentanyl. Heroin filled a space that the removal of the flood of prescribed opioids left. Of course prescription overdose deaths have gone down the past few years. Because they‚Äôve been pulled back. That doesn‚Äôt mean people aren‚Äôt dying at an inflated rate because the actual prescription factor has been removed. This matters. 

I‚Äôm not sure how this isn‚Äôt considered a ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù. All citizens dealing with chronic pain management, addiction or BOTH need help and respect‚Äîand are deserving of it. Harm reduction **must** be expanded. Anti-drug policies will continue to wreck the lives of families and individuals through arrest, incarceration and death. 

In my opinion, it is still absolutely negligent to say to OP *just take them as prescribed and you‚Äôll be fine because I was*. That persons lived experience and relationships is not the same as OP‚Äôs. It‚Äôs worth it to protect someone (especially a young person) from blanket statements such as that. 

It‚Äôs not all or nothing. Education & community without intervention from predatory government policies is what will help people mindfully use any substance. 

I say this as someone in the field of recovery, care, health and addiction. I am not anti-opioid. At all. I‚Äôm 29 and I live with widespread chronic pain. I am deserving to know all my pain management options just as OP and everyone else is. All people with chronic pain deserve safe and *consistent* opioids without living in the fear of having them taken away by the government."

You, as a stranger, do not know OP‚Äôs family history with addiction or their support network. You don‚Äôt know how much meaning and connection they are receiving in their life. 

*Your* experience with opioid pain management is not appropriate for giving OP direct advice to ‚Äútake the meds as prescribed or less and you‚Äôll be fine‚Äù. That would be ideal, yes, however that‚Äôs not a reality for a large amount of people. This has been proven *with* the current opioid crisis. And you should be EVEN MORE educated on both OP‚Äôs pain management future and your own with the limitations pulling back on the security of prescribed opioid pain management for those of us who GENUINELY need it. 

Should an opioid be the *first* line of treatment for someone who is 20 years old? Personally, I don‚Äôt think so. I find it equally as negligent for a doctor to dismiss a young patients pain and tell them to just ‚Äútake a Tylenol‚Äù. This has been said to me. It‚Äôs fucked up. However, there is a real flip side to the opioid crisis you say is manufactured‚Äîyou, OP, and many other people may experience a sudden discontinuation of their prescription which leaves them in hell, and more hell trying to find a Dr. who will help them again. This affects all of us. 

To OP‚Äî take your time, even though you feel like you don‚Äôt have any time left to lose until you feel relief. You are welcome to PM me if you‚Äôd like to talk about both opioid and non-opioid pain management. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you ONE option is best because it was best *for them*. You have more options than you think and if you‚Äôd like resources on these I would be more than happy to share them with you."
minimalism,fiejlti,t3_f7jj4e,1582379575.0,"As for planners, I spent about 40 hours (not kidding) searching online and in stores for the ideal one. Most of the sexy simplistic ones online I loved were out of my price range. I finally found this one on Amazon and it is indeed perfect (for me). 

A5 size, weekly/monthly, and has TWO bookmarks. One for your week and another for the back where there are like 80+ lined pages. This helps with all the detailed notes I need without making me forget about the whole week (when I have a day/month planner, seeing each whole day on its own page screws with my time blindness or whatever). 

There‚Äôs no extra crazy lines, graphics or weird fonts. It‚Äôs super simplistic and has that silky heavy paper that‚Äôs cream colored (like a moleskine) which is so much better for my eyes/stimuli issues. And it‚Äôs cheap AF!

*I have inattentive-ADHD so I‚Äôm always searching for which methods are best for organization, missing deadlines, recording good ideas before they‚Äôre lost forever etc. Also Post-It brand ‚Äúsuper sticky‚Äù notes are GREAT.

illnessfakers,fib58xs,t1_fiauko2,1582314882.0,"Oh babe. I‚Äôm so sorry. I had to look that up, that sounds absolutely miserable and debilitating. Do you have the pain/tingling/numbness neuro kind? And do you take meds for it? You don‚Äôt need to answer that if you don‚Äôt want to obv. 

May I ask how much your payment from for PT was? I know I‚Äôm going to be told to start PT but my insurance isn‚Äôt going to cover much of it. What id like to do is get some therabands and learn at home and eventually (hopefully) join my partners gym and do very very gentle machine weightlifting. I get that‚Äôs probably not advised in PT land but I‚Äôd rather try that than more medical debt. 

I see what you‚Äôre saying. Completely. Because there is no horse for some people. OR the support system to help being without the horse slightly tolerable.

Today I got up and made my own coffee, cleaned the rabbits cages, swept, showered myself, dressed myself, etc. I did all the those things without aid as I‚Äôm SURE she can do *every morning*. Like yeah, I have to move slowly and hold onto things every time I get up and down, I‚Äôve got one lidocaine patch crazily taped to the back of my neck, two capsaicin patches on, tiger balm on most muscle groups and topical NSAID on all my joints, have taken CBD, 900mg gabapentin(so far) , ibuprofen/Tylenol split dose, and got hardcore compression pants on. 

Not once have I considered blogging about it or sharing photos of these things to IG because yes, I‚Äôm in a lot of pain, but at the most this is inconvenient and scary. And private. And it‚Äôs fine. I have my mobility. A LOT of people do not. And I‚Äôd rather give them our energy and care. 

So yeah, I get it now. And I‚Äôm sorry. 

I just joined this sub but I know now what y‚Äôall mean by OTT. 

Fuck that shit. Like yes it‚Äôd be great if more people were educated on invisible illnesses etc, but to this degree is negligent, narcissistic and makes education on disability as a whole far worse."
illnessfakers,fi99y0a,t1_fi98kz0,1582259337.0,"Take your pick: move, incite, impel, persuade, motivate. Substitute one of those if ‚Äúinspire‚Äù reads too flowery for you. I did not mean it as such. 

No, she will not be paying for your PT as much as she won‚Äôt be paying for mine. 

I‚Äôm not calling her ‚Äúinspirational‚Äù in this post. I said a suggestion that one calling for taking action that encourages self reliance is not all bad. 

I can‚Äôt afford PT but I still get on the floor every day and stretch. Every day, even when stretching feels impossible to me. Only because I trained myself like a stupid dog to at least do the bare minimum that‚Äôs good for me. It helps. And it sounds like you probably know the mind numbing, crushing depression that comes along with whatever you‚Äôre dealing with. 

It‚Äôs super fucking hard to see through the fog and shell of a person you once were, from chronic pain etc, to even develop those healthy coping skills if you hadn‚Äôt learned how to pre-pain/whatever. 

I don‚Äôt hate the post. I‚Äôm not crazy about it either."
SuicideWatch,fi948j4,t3_f6vgg2,1582255188.0,"I am so sorry for this. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I had two attempts as well. They left my insides malfunctioning more than they already were, 82 very noticeable scars and staple marks on public facing parts of my body and about $30k of medical debt on my credit. 

Now, I‚Äôm 29 and most of the debt has dropped off. I‚Äôm building my credit back. My latest endoscopy/colonoscopy came back looking pretty good. The scars people can‚Äôt ignore have ended up using me as a vessel to signal to them that: They are seen, they are worthy and they belong here too. 

Staying alive after 13 years of serious self harm and suicide attempts has opened up my life and opportunities for deep connection. That connection actually gets to be my job now, and it honestly makes how much it‚Äôs sucked worth it. 

I know everyone won‚Äôt have this experience but I believe more can if they are supported during the time that you are going through now.

Seek out the sources available to you locally for connection.

illnessfakers,fi65rdv,t3_f6jami,1582179956.0,"Y‚Äôall. Whether she‚Äôs faking it or not anyone with an autoimmune disease, chronic pain, disability or whatever who still has any amount of their mobility SHOULD be going to PT and making incremental changes like this. Cause this is the shit that actually DOES keep you well when your body is malfunctioning. 

Even if she‚Äôs faking it this still just ISN‚ÄôT a bad message to people with pain/fatigue etc. It‚Äôs not even a bad message to the other people faking it lol. Like damn let them be inspired to take any action whatsoever towards self reliance. 

I guess even if the self-reliance message gets screwy through their MBI storylines. Better than the alternative, or am I wrong here?"
AskReddit,fhy6hbz,t1_fhv7x4r,1581969590.0,"I once had such intense lower stomach pain during sex that I had to jump up to vomit immediately. I have IBS anyway, and we‚Äôd been drinking some, so I didn‚Äôt think much of it and we went to bed even though I was in agonizing pain. 

I couldn‚Äôt stand up straight the next morning and needed help getting up the stairs to my apartment. I took Tylenol, ibuprofen, CBD and a bunch of kratom and went to work a couple hours late. I waited 2 whole days before going to the ER because I desperately didn‚Äôt want any more medical/hospital debt. That combo of painkillers wasn‚Äôt cutting it and my stomach had distended to the visual of maybe 6 months pregnancy? So I went. Dr. seemed very kind and offered me IV morphine but I declined because I really wanted to go without such an intense opiate. 

Caved, took the IV, fell asleep, woke up an hour later. Was pushed behind other patients because they thought i was faking it, waited 16 hours for an ultrasound. Was not allowed another dose of any painkiller, even OTC. 

I had a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst that ruptured and bled to the size of a grapefruit, yay! The nurses were horrified I was made to wait that long. 

Second most painful experience after slipping a disc. If your stomach is extremely distended and you‚Äôre in a shit ton of pain, don‚Äôt wait it out!! Ya got organs and ovaries and shit in there."
ADHD,fhxpojf,t1_fhxpkd5,1581959632.0,Thank you! :)
ADHD,fhway7a,t3_f4vat8,1581910902.0,"I‚Äôm so happy for you. A kind of similar thing happened to me. I left the industry I was comfortable, competent but miserable in and began to pursue the one I‚Äôm passionate about. 

Hopefully I‚Äôll be getting my PSS certification in two weeks. :)

Proper medication brought out the best parts of me. It allowed me to step back and look at my life. I could see my dreams as tangible, what I actually wanted, and how I could pursue them because I had the neurological organization met. Now I‚Äôm excited to get to give back to others in the way that matters to me (much like you do!). 

Congratulations on your diagnosis. I wish you well!"
