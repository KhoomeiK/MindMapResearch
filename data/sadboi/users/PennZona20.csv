FFVIIRemake,fpecbwh,t3_gct6mb,1588544694.0,"Lol idgaf bro I’m just saying what i noticed about her.   She is a tad annoying but i think the thing to maybe re-evaluate is how “fake” she is as a dedicated VA.   I think she pulled off brining Aeriths character to life pretty well and if you’d have told me that prior to seeing the game I’d have said how the fuck did she get that job.  

But kudos to her for doing the character justice imo.  

I personally think the fact that people watch gamers stream and some of them make big $$$ is absurd , but then again girls make bank on shit like OnlyFans so maybe I’m just old and prefer old fashioned hookers and strippers if ur gonna pay for it idk.  And also recently I’ve watched a few maximillian dood videos breaking down story and i understand he’s basically the same thing The Brianna girl is and his opinions and theories are actually pretty informative to listen to so maybe they do deserve to be paid ......"
FFVIIRemake,fpdd7mz,t1_fpd9tkc,1588524685.0,"I think it’s just her voice sounds like the fake popular valley girls that went to ur high school.  But if u can get past that she’s actually pretty legit.  

What’s crazy is if you told me she’d be the voice of Aerith before the game was released I’d roll my eyes and assume the worst, but she definitely did the character justice , especially during her introduction across the rooftops she’s amazing bringing sassy , flirty aerith to life.  Not sure if this is her first VA stint but if so she has a bright future at it."
Whatcouldgowrong,fo3ry5j,t1_fo2mndw,1587491960.0,If they are smart enough to know not to kill us for fear of being mass hunted that is truly mind-blowing and amazing imo.
Whatcouldgowrong,fo2fne1,t1_fo234md,1587460585.0,This has always tripped me out too.  Like you figure there’d be at least a few cases of orcas just thrashing a human (outside of sea-world) since they seem to kill shit for the hell of it.
Whatcouldgowrong,fo2fk7y,t1_fo1xr3o,1587460489.0,"The crazy part is if orcas are such assholes why don’t they ever attack humans in the wild.  You see videos of them all the time peacefully swimming by wake-boarders or paddle boarders or even kids swimming in a channel.  

I’d be scared shitless if a pod swam by me just because if they ever decided to fuck w me before eating me it’d be a painful death not a swift one.  

Only explanation to me is we taste like shit to them and they only fuck w animals that are on the menu???"

I think a more realistic goal is great sales on par w Zero Dawn and GoW (2 of the top 10 games ever made) and the critical acclaim that came w those games.  That will be enough for the executives to see a great ROI and keep pouring the necessary resources into parts 2-?? And other projects like this."

Mendelson is a good actor but half the time he’s just staring at furniture and nothing ever happens.  The show is off the rails at this point and the train is still only going 2 mph.  

I was super pumped after the first episode but at this point i think it sucks."
FFVIIRemake,fjbdfx5,t1_fja63ee,1583190913.0,Agree on all that.  They really need to look at how God of War does that.  U can smash everything in that game and it’s as smooth as if u kept running past it.
