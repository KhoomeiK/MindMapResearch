I‚Äôm not sure what your going for with the vocals but i couldn‚Äôt really understand them. If that‚Äôs what your trying to do, it sounds to totally fine.

IndieMusicFeedback,fpobyc6,t3_gelr3t,1588781901.0,This is pretty cool. Not my style but definitely a good experimental track. The intro especially sounds really creepy. I could definitely hear this is a horror movie haha. As for the distortion it could be that you recorded at a higher gain level than you thought. I don‚Äôt think soundcloud does that. I would go back into your recording software and look and see if it‚Äôs clipping anywhere.
IndieMusicFeedback,fpobf5u,t3_gem6p7,1588781641.0,"I actually really really like this! Your vocal tone reminds me of Chris Cornell a little bit with your notes settling a little deeper! I definitely think this could be mixed a little better. The guitar in certain areas could be a little louder I think, but this is great! Sounds really professional."
