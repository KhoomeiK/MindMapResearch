cscareerquestions,fqzjuc2,t3_glrfr8,1589768908.0,"Recent computer science grad. My current experience has been being the only female in a lot of my classes or being one of 2-5 other females in a class of 25+ men.

Thankfully I haven't noticed anything gender based issues. I have had a teacher comment while at his office hours that I should ask for help earlier in projects especially since my male counterparts are not afraid of asking questions. I did not see it as a bad thing just his idea of helpful of advice."
occult,fqzc1uy,t3_glhokn,1589764222.0,This. I want this. Take my money.
learnprogramming,fq9niiq,t1_fq8obk2,1589202972.0,"No problem. If Cybersecurity is something you are interested in having that foundational knowledge is definitely a plus. While it sucks to recommend a certification to get a job, it isnt necessary but it will definitely give you an edge over the competition. I graduated last week with a concentration in cybersecurity for some perspective while there i worked as a cyber security analyst for 2 years."
learnprogramming,fq6y9uo,t3_ggu1mw,1589139393.0,I would take a networking class and a  intro to cyber security principles. These are things you can learn on your own though. Its a plus if you can get your security+ certification since a lot of government security jobs require it and it looks good on a resume. They offer student discounts for it.
cscareerquestions,fp2ng0s,t1_fowoqi9,1588264743.0,That is reassuring. There isn't a lot of talk on government jobs so i was a bit nervous about accepting the position.
cscareerquestions,fp2n62i,t1_fowxgz9,1588264612.0,Thanks!
cscareerquestions,fowuaby,t3_g9y1ap,1588127293.0,i think you should consider the longevity of which ever job you choose since they are start ups. Pay wise it seems they kind of level each other up.

BPD,fot3pl7,t3_g9e10y,1588043951.0,"It would be a good idea to research a little about BPD. But it is a good idea to assume she has it and treat her as such. But if you insist, a book called ""I hate you, don't leave"" may be beneficial.

witchcraft,fot1hot,t3_g9ensr,1588042556.0,"Hi! Secular witch here. I think checking out chaos magick would be a good resource for you. It involves the ideology that your belief is the source of your magick anything else be it tools, herbs, candles, etc just aid in the craft. So believing in dieties, fae, etc isn't necessary unless you want. I am discrediting or invalidating any who does believe in those things. I'm just throwing out a different view point. I would also recommend Carl Jung."

witchcraft,fmiuvjl,t3_fvivvo,1586117396.0,"This link is to a video where someone goes over 100 types of witches based on the elements. Most people are not gonna be 1 type of witch they are gonna be a mix of a few types from this list and that is okay. This mainly breaks witches down into the types of magick that can be performed. But here you go:
