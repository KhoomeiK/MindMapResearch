helicopterparents,fmyq259,t1_fmyitod,1586492459.0,"Yep. At the end of the day, it’s all about control. I lost a lot of friends and relationships never worked out because I’d be interrogated about who I wanted to hang out with. It got to the point where my Dad would block numbers on my phone if they were out of area or if I texted the number late or too much. It was a really dark time in my life.

However, I’m beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel. Since getting a job, attending school (returning next semester), and getting a car, I have obtained a bit more freedom and have put more distance between myself and my parents. They still have some control over me, but I’ve been pushing boundaries. As they say, it’s easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission.

I’m hoping to move out this fall (if all this damn quarantine shit ends soon and I can return back to work and pay bills) and I’ll truly be free. I promise it gets better. I can’t change the past but I’m going to keep moving forward until I get what I’ve always wanted most: freedom, friendships, and a place of my own where I feel safe and in control of my own life. We’ll all get there. Keep your head up."

helicopterparents,fmxzhc1,t3_fxuz7h,1586474960.0,"Hey, I feel the same way. I spent basically everyday in high school as if I was in quarantine. Wasn’t allowed to hang out with friends, stay out, or spend the night with friends. I resent my parents for robbing me of those years I should have spent developing into a young adult. 

As a 23 year old, it’s starting to bite back. I’m socially underdeveloped compared to others my age, im learning from mistakes I should have made as a teenager, I get panic attacks when I’m out by myself (currently on antidepressants as a result). Plus I lack self confidence and suffer from imposter syndrome since I was never allowed to take risks and my parents felt they needed to hold my hand constantly.

My helicopter parents “trying to keep me safe” has done more harm than good. And I’m paying the consequences for it now."

And what’s ridiculous is that in one of those instances the parents were livid at ME and the establishment. Then after my manager comped their meal, the parents proceeded to continue letting their goblins run circles around the restaurant again! 

Can’t control your kids, don’t bring them to restaurants. For my sake and that of the other diners. Your kids’ safety is at risk when you can’t control them in high traffic areas."
