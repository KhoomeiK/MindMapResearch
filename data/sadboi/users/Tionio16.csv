Anxiety,flj20y5,t3_fp4v7t,1585196588.0,"I too work in an essential job.  Or at least one that qualifies.  I don‚Äôt have to work with the public, but there are 85ish people in the building I work at.  I wasn‚Äôt so scared for myself, but I live with two people over 65 and I have been terrified of catching it and giving it to them.  I talked with my boss and they suggested FMLA since I have had a history of anxiety.  I went to my doctor and was able to get off for the next two weeks with FMLA.  Don‚Äôt know if that will work for you, but I would still suggest that you be open with your boss.  They may tell you they are fine with you staying home, you‚Äôll never know if you don‚Äôt ask."
