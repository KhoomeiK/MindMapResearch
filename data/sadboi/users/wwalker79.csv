And I want to die every day. None of that makes me happy. Thought it would pull me out of depression because I set all of those goals and saw them through. Nope.

I messed up on Monday and had an authentic stroke of my own doing on accident, and the few moments before I thought I’d die alone in my apartment were very nice."

The moving lips from the picture box tell me everything is fine, tho. And I trust them. I trust them because I no longer care about the lies I’ve grown fat upon. Apathy consumes me. The last joy I possess is the pull of my tattered curtain, with which I shall pull of my own volition as the apathy runs down my neck."

You signed a paper saying you know about the rules. They get ya on the grey areas tho."

greentext,era18lw,t1_er9vkyr,1560633968.0,"I’m not a deadbeat! Two degrees, speak German fluently, excellent job and income, own my home and a Lexus, and a classically trained pianist. I would trade every bit of it for someone to love. Have a case of the big gay and it’s extremely frowned upon where I live. Trying to convince myself to move somewhere and find the love of my life, but I can’t see starting over somewhere at 40 is a good move. Patiently waiting and looking around the area for someone, but 5 years of that is getting frustrating!"
CatSlaps,er9w87k,t3_c0zakb,1560631148.0,"Part of it is allogrooming, and another part is anxiety. Take a look around your house. Is there anything that would stress you out of you had an extremely good sense of smell or hearing? Are y’all loud people in general? Cats get stressed out easily, especially if you are stressed out of just a loud rambunctious person."
greentext,er9ve2c,t1_er9sr2n,1560630671.0,"I find happiness where I can. Always kind to others in my orbit and very nice to strangers. I practice happiness and have for a long time. After I escaped from the kidnapping thing, I turned in to a bad junkie. Stopped all that mess, got a couple of degrees way later in life, and am a vice-president of a large bank now. All the money, all the material possessions, and all the success should do it right? I don’t know what the fuck happened to me, but it’s almost as if I don’t want to be happy. That’s the only thing I can think of. I’m strung out on pills (for years now) and do meth on the weekends sometimes. Fucking hate myself. What kind of piece of shit can’t be happy with all of this? Self-centered, narcissistic, asshole douche who is doing the “poor me my life has been so rough give me pity” bullshit."

That severely damaged me and as soon as I got away, I vowed to myself that I would never bring another person into this world. I haven’t had a relationship of any kind since 2006 and as hard as I try it just hasn’t happened. Boo-fucking-hoo. Whatever. My fault I couldn’t move on from it and can recognize that I’m weak. I have no one in my life at all except random Reddit strangers and that’s enough for me. People have it way worse than I do and my life isn’t special or unique or deserves anything more than the next person. I try and channel everything in me to be a kind person to everyone - it’s what I have left to give."

AutoDetailing,eqt975c,t1_eqszww1,1560305688.0,"Gotcha. Worked as a salesperson at Acura for 6 years. Here’s what I got. New off the truck: Lots of haze on interior glass; some windshields will be be coated in bugs from the semi ride. Make sure to report any scratch to someone - even small ones. Be careful with interior shine products on displays and the plastic that covers the speedometer. Be nice and neat when removing window stickers and put them in the glove box - people like to keep them. When delivering a car to a customer, make sure all the door/trunk jambs and gas fill area are completely dry (dry the underside of the door too). Tire shine - you end up with an unshined spot if you don’t roll the car back some and do the spot that was touching the ground. There’s a giant difference between a good detail and a great detail - even on new cars!"
