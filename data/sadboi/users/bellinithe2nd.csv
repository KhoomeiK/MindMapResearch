PCOS,fmikobh,t3_fvie8z,1586111489.0,Laser hair removal has been a godsend. Obviously not something you can do rn but for the long term it’s great. You can get good deals on Groupon so it can be pretty affordable. One thing that’s helped with arm hair and other body hair is just bleaching it with some boxed (sally Hansen) or w/e at the drugstore. Otherwise I wouldn’t be able to keep up that shit

askwomenadvice,fklcsqn,t3_fj6lh4,1584303523.0,For whatever reason it’s extremely hard to get these types of people to change. I think the best course of action might be to implement a weekly chore chart if they’re amenable. Although you’ll prob still end up cleaning up after them if it’s evenly distributed.

I don’t think going up one cup size will make a difference in how they feel. I’d recommend just going to a consultation and feeling the different shapes of implants they have so you can get an idea of how it would feel in your hand

I guess if depends on how formal you’re wanting it to be/ how much you’re willing to pay for that one formal occasion.

My question to you all is how to gracefully go about letting my program know? I’m set with my internship to start in late August and I feel really bad pulling out after committing to work there next year. Does anyone have experience with quitting before even starting the program? Or at any point?"
