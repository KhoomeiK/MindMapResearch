mentalillness,fpxaa1k,t1_fpxa3nu,1588978707.0,Thank you I will definitely try it.
mentalillness,fpx5c3w,t1_fpx4v4u,1588975953.0,Yes I’ll let you know when I get some feedback.
mentalillness,fpx4d0t,t1_fpx45p8,1588975423.0,"No problem thanks for talking with me tho. I was thinking it might have something to do with ADHD. I’ve been asked to get evaluated and I talked with my doctor online, but I haven’t gotten any results back."
mentalillness,fpx3rr4,t1_fpx2qf1,1588975108.0,"But the odd thing is right now, I’m just staring at my work. I’m not even trying to escape my homework by watching a show or playing a game on my phone like usual. I’m just staring at it."
mentalillness,fpx383h,t1_fpx2qf1,1588974820.0,"No, I’m not interested in any of my homework. If something requires a certain level of thinking I just give up, I know I can do it. I think my brain is wired to feel good right now. Nothing else matters except how you feel right now. Doesn’t matter what will happen down the road, as long as you are not stressed keep doing what you’re doing. Kind of explains why I can never schoolwork at home. At school I’m always paying attention and I get my work done there. Once I get home nothing will get done."
mentalillness,fpx1yvj,t1_fpx1q8w,1588974140.0,"My dad took away my Xbox since I’m doing bad in school. Before that I would just play games, nothing else. Now I’m just staring at some homework. Can’t really focus on it."
mentalillness,fpx0m08,t1_fpx03ks,1588973409.0,"I don’t think goals are going to work for me. Last summer if I did well in the last semester she would take me to my favorite artists’ concert. I really wanted to go. But guess what, nothing changed. If that can’t motivate me then I have no idea what will. Must be a rock in my head."
mentalillness,fpwwpzb,t1_fpwsm5t,1588971363.0,"I have that exact same feeling, when I’m playing games and I invite my friend into a voice chat and they don’t join, I start questioning the relationship we have “do they not like me?” Or I will start to get mad at them and say mean shit. And they do eventually join. I know they will join sometime, I just can’t stop the negative thoughts."
