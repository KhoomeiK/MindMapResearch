depression,fr0qovz,t3_glypwy,1589804259.0,"Damn... It's like i stared back at my own life. I'm sorry you're going through this right now, i know it's not very helpful. I'm in the same rut, 24 trying to get my GED, maybe college afterwards. Just got a minor job in advertising for a friend's business, but i wind up watching shows on Amazon all day. I know they're going to ask about progress soon, scares the hell out of me. 

I know it sounds pretty generic but try a year, maybe just a course and see what happens. Some people can find inspiration in the strangest places, if not then at least you find something semi productive to do. 

Again I'm sorry you're going through this, i hope you'll get through it soon and have some good things happen. Hang in there, taking the first step can be the hardest part. Take care okay? :)"
unpopularopinion,foh4zo3,t3_g72qyf,1587760603.0,"Thank you! I've had this opinion on ""influencers"" since i first heard the term, and i would say they are not that helpful when it comes to society, to put it lightly.   
I would say to some extent that influencers are almost like a cult following at this point, give someone a platform and they will use it to the best of their ability, and their followers will do everything in their power to try to prove said influencers are doing something besides making useless videos."
mentalillness,fnd1wz8,t3_g0zb93,1586855488.0,"Wow.. It's like you read my life almost. Anyway i know the exact feeling. Applied for a dozen jobs, accepted to work with a friend's family, scheduled an appointment with the DMV for my licence, even had enough motivation to work on my GED finally. 

Sadly the lockdown/quarantines hit right as things were in motion. Now i'm stuck at home trying to figure out what to do for every day, sleep schedule is more backwards than a highly flexible yoga instructor, which doesn't really help with the mental. 

Uh...sorry for the bad joke, it's one of the only things keeping me even slightly entertained these days. Things could definitely be a lot worse right now, but it's a bit frustrating is all. Hope you're all doing well."

Forward to the end of the night, the 19 got a bit drunk while i was away to get something at the store.

Illnesses, viruses, hell even natural disasters don't discriminate and will destroy anything it comes in contact with. I wish people understood that more instead of criticizing people with mental illness. 

I'm white, so i won't pretend that i know what it might be like for you. One thing i can say (sorry for it being generic), is that you can help to change how people see mental illness, especially as a person of color, as a human being even if you want to look past race. 

Sadly i can't really provide an answer as to how you can accomplish this, but keep going until you find a way to get through to people. Stay safe and i hope all goes well for you."

This next one might sound strange but being on Reddit helps sometimes, knowing that we aren't alone in life and that other people are going through similar issues. 

Besides that i enjoy the more simple things in life like watching a new (to me) movie or tv series, and reading occasionally. I'm currently watching a show called Mr Robot and reading a book called The House of the Scorpion, both of which i would recommend."

Secondly i wouldn't say you're wrong for trying to talk anybody out of suicide, whether it's once or multiple times. It's just unfortunate that you were involved in this imaginary relationship thing.
