changemyview,fqtln98,t3_gkq9oo,1589641403.0,"We as people do need protein, but a huge problem with the meat industry that I haven‚Äôt seen others address is the amount of land and water required, and the amount of greenhouse gasses produced. 

Only 2.5% of water on Earth is freshwater, and only about 1% of that is actually accessible to us(source: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/freshwater/freshwater-crisis/). A single burger requires over 600 gallons, or 2000 liters(source: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-gallons-of-water-to-make-a-burger-20140124-story.html%3f_amp=true). So hundred of thousands liters of precious freshwater is being used every single day. This is a huge problem, especially as climate change is causing some areas to experience droughts. 

Another problem, specifically with cows, is how much greenhouse gasses they produce. Cows fart quite a bit, and their farts produce methane, a greenhouse gas more potent than carbon dioxide(source: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/climate/cows-global-warming.amp.html). 

26% of ice-free land on Earth is used for animal production(source: http://www.fao.org/3/ar591e/ar591e.pdf$ This is leading to a LOT of habitat destruction for native species all over the world. It‚Äôs estimated that 80% of the deforestation of the Amazon is due to animal agriculture and people slashing and burning the forest to clear the land for animal use(https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/land-use/cattle-ranching). 

Yes, our ancestors ate meat and it‚Äôs natural for us to eat meat. However, modern animal agriculture is not natural and it‚Äôs rapidly destroying our planet. The meat industry has grown to be ENORMOUS all over the world."

ACTrade,fqn1t5t,t3_gjoewx,1589487237.0,"I don‚Äôt watch anime but my top 3 shows are 

1. Bojack Horseman. This show is hard to say a favorite and least favorite character because all the characters are super complex and complicated, and there‚Äôs not one character who is just good or just bad. But that‚Äôs part of the brilliance of the show, it‚Äôs hard to hate the ‚Äúbad‚Äù characters who are ‚Äúbad‚Äù people, because you seem them struggle and you learn about their traumas and their mental illnesses, and it‚Äôs hard to not relate in some way. 

2. Parks and Rec. This show is just a classic, and the only one I can state favorites for. My favorite character is probably Jean-Ralphio because everything he says is just so funny and he‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous. My least favorite is definitely Ann because her whole storyline becomes ‚ÄúI need to find a man‚Äù, and out of the whole show her character was easily the most bland. 

3. Black Mirror. Every episode is it‚Äôs own story so there isn‚Äôt a singular character to love or hate, so I‚Äôll say that this show is one of my favorites because it‚Äôs just so cool. All of the ideas presented in the show are insane to think about(especially as technology continues to advance), and every episode just blows your mind in different ways, and it leaves you feeling so many things. I‚Äôve never watched a show that‚Äôs made me feel Black Mirror has."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fqfq0mg,t1_fqflwxt,1589329467.0,"As somebody who grew up with a fairly wealthy family, the bigger problem(for me at least) is you never get to actually have problems as a kid. For example: I would get upset because my older brother punched me. I would come to my mom crying. My mom would tell me ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that bad. it could be worse. there are children in Africa who are starving‚Äù. 

Every single one of my problems was minimized because I was lucky because I was wealthy. Because my parents had money, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to talk about my feelings or issues or problems without being shut down and made to feel guilty because I should‚Äôve felt lucky because I wasn‚Äôt starving.

I‚Äôm not denying that I was definitely very privileged and I feel very lucky because I never went without meals, clothes, or a roof over my head....but the reason why I felt the need to respond to this is because you say ‚Äú money makes it so there aren‚Äôt any problems‚Äù. That‚Äôs not true. Being wealthy doesn‚Äôt mean the kids don‚Äôt still encounter problems. We absolutely have problems to, especially since our world is so small when we‚Äôre kids. The true problem(at least in my personal experience) comes from the fact that wealthy kids just have their problems dismissed as not ‚Äúreal‚Äù and so they never learn how to deal with them. In attempts to teach me ‚Äúperspective‚Äù my mom really just shut me down and made me feel immensely guilty because the fact that there were children in africa didn‚Äôt make my pain from my brother‚Äôs punch go away. that fact only made me feel bad for not appreciating my life. and all of these things my mom said to me as a kid became debilitating ocd for me later in life. So the problem isn‚Äôt the lack of encountering problems, but rather a dismissal of the ones we did have(which as you said does mean you never learn to cope in a healthy way)

AnimalCrossing,fo434wm,t1_fo3uywp,1587497391.0,"I also don‚Äôt want to be an ass, but I am diagnosed with OCD so I have to speak up here. 

While using ‚Äúocd‚Äù as an adjective might make it easier for neurotypicals to understand you, using it like that makes it a hell of a lot harder for people with ocd to be understood. 

For example: people often associate OCD with cleanliness, because a common form of ocd is fear of germs. THIS IS NOT THE ONLY FORM OF OCD. I personally have something called ‚Äúpure o‚Äù, where my ocd largely exists as mental thoughts/rituals/compulsions. Basically, my ocd is very real but is very invisible. When I tell people I‚Äôm ocd, I‚Äôm almost always met with ‚Äúoh so you‚Äôre like a clean freak?‚Äù and when I try to explain that yes I am ocd but no I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúclean freak‚Äù, I get lots of looks of confusion...and I‚Äôve even been told that I‚Äôm not really ocd. So by using ocd as an adjective to help explain your own disorder, you‚Äôre creating more negative connotations and misunderstanding for people who truly are ocd. 

Using ocd as an adjective minimizes the impact ocd can have on a person. ocd is crippling, and every waking moment of every single day I am fighting thoughts that attack my worst fears and insecurities, and I have no control over it. So I think it‚Äôs really important to not be using mental disorders as adjectives, because it really minimizes how detrimental these disorders can be while also spreading widespread misunderstanding. 

Again I‚Äôm not trying to be a jerk or anything, I‚Äôm just trying to take my power back and speak out about the realities of ocd so I can help educate people :)"
