ptsd,exoae51,t3_ctthn4,1566472947.0,"hey, ex mormon here too. im really sorry you're going through this. its really tough. it's absolutely not shameful or your fault for feeling upset when you're reminded of what happened to you. 

was there perhaps anything your therapist suggested for you to do when you feel like this? i worked with mine on controlling and regulating my breathing which helps me feel a bit calmer and in control. she also suggested that if i ever felt on the verge of panic, i can ground myself by describing things around me to myself. e.g. right now i am standing on a soft white carpet and i can hear a dog barking. it helps to take my mind off it a bit. if it's really bad, i reach out to a friend and talk about anything else to distract myself. i also like to listen to music when im just feeling generally anxious/down.

if you're not seeing a professional now i implore you to find one, preferably with experience in trauma, to talk with. there are just some things i really can't talk about/don't feel comfortable discussing with my friends and family, which i can then offload onto my psychiatrist without feeling guilty. it's alright to feel like you don't click with a specific therapist either, feel very free to look around for someone who is right for you before settling. even seeing your gp would be really good! i have a good relationship with my gp and i talk with her every few months or so just to touch base. she also keeps in touch with my school counselor and psychiatrist too.

im really glad you're still here. i hope you can find something that works for you. i admire your strength."

MadeOfStyrofoam,eterd5m,t3_cb6qsb,1562743395.0,once mine was 45 minutes late and then talked to me for 15 minutes instead of an hour :/ but then i had a really nice conversation with my friend/crush and it was ok
SuicideWatch,et9sfwj,t3_camfhs,1562604368.0,"hey, im really sorry to hear that you're having a hard time. it sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed with everything happening around you and honestly, i get it. i used to live in oakland actually (until i was 10) and i remember my family struggled a lot financially while living there.

it was really tough and it placed a lot of stress on my parents but we always had each other so sometimes i felt like things were going to be ok. it's weird but 10 year old me was aware that like, yeah, things were going to be okay again, but i knew that things were also going to get shitty again. and that thought was really liberating? to be honest? because it didn't make me think that the world, or my life, or my parents' lives, were inherently or naturally shitty, just that like... all manner of things happen. sometimes it was my dog getting hit by a car and sometimes it was my dad getting a raise.

it's strange realising how much recently i've thought how heaping bags of shit are just inevitable and neverending. that because they're never going to stop, i should just give up now and free myself... but i was tunneling, hard, in the periods where i felt as if i had no options, as if i was powerless. because at the same time the little pieces of chocolate for the soul are inevitable as well. the *dancing-to-freaking-out-the-neighbourhood* sorta days will come to you with the same certainty that you will have *crying-to-moonlight-on-the-river* sorta nights (i mayyy have looked at your profile and i'm also a mac fan and i got pretty excited sorry).

since i'm 16 i really don't have a lot of experience with relationships but i'm glad that you were able to recognise and accept that your partner wasn't providing your emotional needs, rather than ignoring or overlooking it. i think that you're really strong for that, and i think you're really strong for being able to tell yourself that you deserve better people around you, and cutting it off.

i am worried though that you're living alone for extended periods of time. i definitely enjoy time alone but living alone for months can be pretty isolating (particularly with everything else going on in your life) and i can't imagine how particularly isolating it is since your roommate is a close friend. is there a chance you could have family members over, or any other friends over? or you could stay with family or a friend? if they have a car you could borrow, that would work out really nicely. don't be afraid to ask for help from the people around you like you have here. even though you're alone now doesn't mean you're alone in general; your family love you for who you are, and your friends do too, more than you'll ever know.

i've been struggling with my words in this very long, rambly comment, but i guess i'm saying that though this isn't a promise that you will find a fix for your car soon, or that you will find someone again, or that you will be around someone at home, your life is not inherently a bag of shit. you've been given a bag of shit right now, and i'm really in awe of how strong you've been in managing it. reach out to your family, to your other friends, in the same way you have here (you're always welcome to pm me too), i hope they'll give you a little spoonful of something sweet."
