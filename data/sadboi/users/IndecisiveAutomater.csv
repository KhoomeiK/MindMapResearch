I would say that this is still self-harm. You're taking enough of something to hurt you even if you don't intend for it to kill you. Perhaps it would fall more under substance abuse, but you could argue that substance abuse is also a form of self-harm."

StopSelfHarm,fmnzx2o,t3_fwenlo,1586240461.0,"I used to have an extremely similar train of thought to you. If it's an outlet and I take care of my wounds, and I'm mentally stable, why is it a bad thing to self harm?

I can only speak for cutting personally but the reasons it's not a ""positive"" outlet is because you're intentionally bringing harm to yourself as a method of coping with pain. Yes, maybe you don't want to *die*, but it's an outlet for pain that's coming at your expense. While not self-harm, drinking to cope with pain is seen as a negative outlet as well since it's a substance that could easily be abused. The same goes for self-harm. Maybe you think you have it under control, but it's unhealthy to harm yourself.

Yes, self-harm can help you cope with emotions. However, **there are other ways of coping**, ones that shouldn't involve you physically harming yourself. This is not how one should cope with pain because it could very easily spiral. I'd also like to go out on a limb and say that a mentally sound person would not self-harm as you described. Assuming you meant cutting, if one feels the need to use their skin for art by way of cutting it, I don't think that's healthy or that they could be deemed sound of mind. Should they be *stopped*? That depends on what you mean. I wouldn't say it should be illegal or anything but you should be heavily discouraged from doing it as it's a dangerous and ultimately harmful path.

I would say you're incorrect in thinking that it could be a positive outlet. I understand where your train of thought is coming from but it is still a negative thing to do. Anything that intentionally brings harm to one's self is not a positive thing and even if one feels it is under control, it may not always be. Indeed it can help cope with emotions but there *are* other ways to deal with the feelings that might drive one to self-harm. That's one of the key steps in recovery: Finding an outlet for these emotions to take the place.

I hope I gave a clear enough explination. Good luck to you!"

KamikazeByWords,fkhtsl3,t1_fkhsjxk,1584205834.0,"My school was an absolute mess. I'm in the UK, and attended a ""secondary school"", which is essentially equivalent to high school. We attend from 11 years old to 16 years old and can leave after that, so our science education is probably cut short from that. As well as this, some schools including the one I attended only mandated that we study science from 11 years old to 14 years old. On top of this, our teacher was a really nice yet innocent man, and our class would take advantage of him and distract him so he didn't actually teach us. They'd get him talking about football matches or Bruce Springsteen. I didn't really get any science education except for some VERY basic sex education where we had one class on it at 12 years old. That's it.

In my school, after 14 you only had some compulsory subjects; English Language, Mathematics, Religious Education and Learning for Life and Work (mental health/employability). We study these for two years and get our first actual on-paper qualifications called ""GCSEs"". If you chose to keep on GCSE science, you studied physics, chemistry and biology. This is mandatory in some schools, but was not in others including mine. I didn't choose to keep on science, so I didn't learn any biology really. I knew people who kept those subjects on and they learned about all kinds of scientific areas including biology. What I know is from asking them, other friends, watching videos and reading some books.

Prior to Secondary School is Primary School, which you attend from roughly 5-10. I really didn't learn much in Primary School aside from basic maths.  We did have other classes, including science, but I don't remember really anything except that I know we had those classes.

I got good grades in my 14 years at Primary+Secondary school, but I didn't actually learn anything on the subjects. I just learned how to answer a test paper."
KamikazeByWords,fkhn1f7,t1_fkhl5i7,1584202201.0,"Life wasn't created by evolution. Life evolved. Where did the first cells come from? There is evidence for some theories out there, but it's still debated. Evolution and its related processes such as natural selection, only describe how life changed over millions of years. It doesn't say where life came from.

Just because we don't know for absolute certainty where life came from, doesn't mean it was any kind of creator, let alone an intelligent creator. Transformers also didn't evolve into existence, as far as I know the canon is that they were created. Putting that aside, machinery cannot be compared to biological life. Transformers would be more along the lines of some form of AI, which would be completely unrelated to the biology field.

They didn't state a rational point, what they're doing is known as creating a straw-man.

EDIT: No one said life evolved by ""chance"" either. You're probably referring to life itself existing ""by chance"". That's not exactly the case though. The universe is huge. There's a possibility life exists somewhere else out there. I've read that statistically it's likely that there *is* life on other planets somewhere out there. However, to make a sci-fi reference, it may be life but not as we know it.

I'd also like to ask you, if we were indeed made by an intelligent creator, why did they put us on this planet? There are so many things in the universe at large out to kill us, not to mention here on earth. Why did they also make us so susceptable to diseases and illnesses? Why do our bodies contain so many ""imperfections""? Indeed, why do these faults extend to other species beyond humans too? If we were made by an **intelligent** creator as you believe, they could have did a much better job. If *all* life was created by this intelligent being, where are they now? Why have they not left a mark for their work either, so that we know we were created and designed by them?

Your argument for intelligent design as it stands right now isn't very strong."

KamikazeByWords,fkhlghe,t1_fkhh27q,1584201331.0,"It's pretty long winded.  Basically she thinks all atheists believe in evolutionary theory and accept ""science"" as their ""religion"", since she and others like her can't fathom that atheism just means you don't have any theistic religious belief. While many atheists do accept evolution, being an atheist is irrelevant to that.

Her argument in the post is that since, in her mind, atheists believe in evolution, they don't believe her interpretation of a god designed life on earth. She is grossly misunderstanding evolution and believes that atheists are saying since humans evolved over millions of years, why can't a car do the same? She thinks evolution means things can change for no reason. That is just completely untrue and anyone who has spent a minute reading about evolution could tell you that.

A similar argument used by people like her is that if you leave all the parts for an item, such as a clock, out on a table and give it a few million years, apparently people that accept evolution think it'll magically turn into a clock.

I'm an atheist and I accept evolution but both of those are separate. Her understanding of evolution and its associated processes are completely and utterly incorrect.

I'd also like to take this opportunity to say I'm not a science buff by any means. What I know comes from my own research, asking questions, and trying to educate myself as I didn't get this education growing up. If anything I said is wrong, someone who knows a heck of a lot more than me could probably describe it better."

Trans people don't mutilate their bodies. If you're referring to various surgeries such as SRS, I don't see how it's mutilation. Some individuals that don't like trans people shared some misinformation and pics of the very very early stages of recovery for a transman getting SRS. This is all I can think you are referencing.

If it's the surgeries themselves you're calling mutilation, then would you consider someone who isn't trans getting surgery to be ""mutilation""? Say someone who gets a boob job, or a nose job? What about people who aren't trans that get hair removal? 

Taking hormones and transitioning with everything else it can entail such as SRS, trachea shave, hair removal, and a plethora of other procedures, aren't really mutilation. They're helping an individual cope with their illness - dysphoria. How would you propose treating it?"
