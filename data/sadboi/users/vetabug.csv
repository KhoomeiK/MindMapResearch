ChildrenofDeadParents,fqbnlri,t3_ghy0r2,1589240377.0,"You know it's really hard to try to come up with all the answers to the questions you have under the best circumstances. And since your circumstances are definitely in the worst category I think it would be best if you tried to leave them where they are while keeping in mind only the things you know of to be factual and/or true. 

Truth 
1. Your dad loved you and you loved your dad
2. He was an imperfect person as all human beings are.
3. He did good things and he made some bad choices.
4. You are not happy with some of those bad choices and since his death you struggle to forgive him for the mistakes he made. But even with that you miss him very much. 
5. None of those mistakes define the love you had for him or the love he had for you.

When we're kids we look to our parents to manage everything for us and they better get it right all the time. But the sad thing is is that more often than not our parents are still kids themselves who haven't learned enough about themselves, the world and how to handle it all at the same time. The other global pandemic were facing right now is emotional immaturity. Its pretty vapid and unless people all of a sudden have some self awareness knocked into them somehow I dont see this changing anytime soon. So you need to adjust your own self awareness of others and focus on compassion, empathy and forgiveness if you really want to lessen the struggle you are going though within yourself about your dads passing. It's not easy. Not at all. Just try to do something each day little by little."

Humans are resilient. Sometimes it may not seem like it but we are. Think about how truly awful our ancestors had it thousands of years ago. They saw and did things that we couldnt even comprehend.

I dont know anyone who actually WANTS to go to a funeral but I dont know anyone else besides me who is terrified of them. I'm already stressing out about a good friend of mine who has cancer. He is terminal and when the chemo stops working and the cancer resumes and progresses he will die. I'm devastated I'm going to lose my friend. I also have no idea how I'm going to explain not attending his funeral."

But we have never talked shit about each other, our spouses now are not any trouble and we all get along. This is just nuts. But I have a couple early memories from my childhood when I was 4 and one of them was my mom and dad arguing. It has always stuck with me. Kids absorb so much their parents are completely clueless about when they are little. They may not understand but they see and hear things. When you as a parent decide to be dishonest to your kid so that you come out looking good and the other parent looks bad that shit is going to come back and bite you in the ass one day. BIG TIME."

Although it has brought a lot of pain and heartache to you in a time when you should have been celebrating your new marriage with them all  you have been given an opportunity to have that relationship with your mom you never got before. There is a silver lining here. Make the most of it. 1000xS NTA!

u/samsalas8 I didnt think your story could get anymore tragic.😩😩😩😩

But then it did. OMG, 

Your poor mother. I cannot imagine going from wife to mistress and being so broken inside throughout it all and not believing she was better than that. Those were some serious self worth issues she had. I know because I have them too. A small part of me can see myself doing something similar if I let those issues get ahold of me. I cannot stress enough the importance of mental health. Its nothing to be ashamed of. If you or anyone you know is struggling with something but not really talking about it or downplaying the situation please please please be there for them. Keep them company even if they say they are fine. It can make a world of difference just knowing there is one human being on this planet that cares about you. Just be consistent with it as much as possible. Therapy is another must. I know not everyone may have insurance for it or money to pay for it but if it wasnt for therapy I dont think I could have finally cracked my self worth issues. It took a long time to do too. They run very deep and I'm not yet quite there but I've at least gotten to the point I can accept who I am and that i have some value to add to this world. Not sure how much but it's not nothing. I believe there are two kinds of suicidal people. The ones who have so much guilt or shame inside and the ones who feel worthless. I'm sure there are those who have been battling both. I'm so sorry you lost your mom. I hope you know that it's not your fault and try not to beat yourself up too much over it. 

Edit: had to comment on u/samsalas8 update.

Edit 2: spelling"

If one half of it isnt completely overgrown the other half of it has dead plants. I go there 3 times a week to feed a TNR cat colony with permission from the GM. I know all the security guards. I am in no way trespassing or stealing anything! You said it yourself, this sub is for being helpful, answering questions and sharing pics. That's what I came here for and cakeeater808 wants to be the shrubbery police. Go ahead, I'm unsubbing right now. I swear it would seem like during a pandemic people would be a bit more understanding of one another instead of automatically accuse them of stealing something. What a bunch of snobs."
ChildrenofDeadParents,foh8r4x,t3_g7dlct,1587761917.0,"My mom died when I was 4. She was cremated before the funeral that I of course had to attend. I remember it. It's one of the only early memories I have besides my parents arguing once before she died. 
Even though I did not see her body I was and still am traumatized by it all. To this day I do not do funerals. I don't even plan on being at my own. I actually have it in my will that I absolutely do not want a funeral or service of any kind when I die. I also have a phobia of dead bodies and I didn't even see hers. 

That's just my experience though. Everyone is different. There is a possibility of your boys having life long issues because of it. I honestly wish they hadnt made me go at all."

The elephant story was more about getting your attention because, well, elephants are hard to ignore. Lol. But it's not just elephants, it's all kinds of other species. Including humans. People who belong to those  tribes in remote areas of the world who have had little to no contact with civilization as we know it deal with death and loss just like the elephants. They dont have all the modern day b.s. we have to complicate their existence. They just do what they do, good or bad they do it and get through it. It's all they know. Sometimes I think we know too much. There's way too much information out there. It depends on how you interpret it all and what actions you decide to take moving forward."

ChildrenofDeadParents,fo8wo1i,t3_g65z99,1587605408.0,"This may sound kinda fucked up to say but if I had to choose between not being sad about it or being sad about it I would choose the first. Let me just briefly explain why.

I lost my mom at the age of four. I have no recollection of any of those things you mentioned you are starting to forget about having to do with her. Which I've always told myself something like ""You can't miss what you never had"" sorta story and for most of my life I bought it. That was until my mid 30's. Not going into too much detail about it all but boy was I wrong. I'm now 42 and dealing with the realization of how much losing her at such a young age affected me without really knowing it had has not been easy. Ton's of sadness, feelings of worthlessness, depression, anxiety, ptsd. They have all caught up with me. I was never offered therapy at anytime during my childhood and I think it would have done me no good then either like you said your experience was but NOW is a different story. If this is bothering you then maybe seeking some professional help would be beneficial? Because if anything, you don't want this to be something that you have to deal with down the road and if or when that happens it's similar to being hit by a train.

&#x200B;

Another random thing I thought about when I read your post was Elephants. They are well known for having very strong emotional bonds to one another especially their offspring. When tragedy strikes and a mama loses her calf they mourn like we do. They wail and groan and they don't want to separate from them. If you've ever seen one of those moments on NatGeo or Animal Planet then you know how heart wrenching that can be. However, they eventually get on with their lives. They do not wallow in self pity or become severely depressed. They move on. Just as we should too. Definitely do not anyone tell you how to deal with this. To each his own. No one else has any place to tell you how to be or feel about it.
