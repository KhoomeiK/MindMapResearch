BrainFog,eyptiad,t1_eyp8yrr,1567310766.0,"Yeah, I’m positive that it’s stress-related as well. I was dealing with the abuse for a year so that’s plenty of time to screw with my brain. When you say “this is where time is important, and a factor”, what do you mean? Also yes, the heavy fatigue could also be described as weakness. Having brain fog impede our abilities to perform well really is the worst, and we can only do our best to get better."
BrainFog,eyp263s,t1_eynh7ek,1567288212.0,"Yeah, I’m pretty sure my brain fog started after a previous relationship became emotionally and physically abusive. I was mildly depressed beforehand because of my perfectionist tendencies and fear of failure, but I eventually became severely depressed after the abuse started. I went from being a top honors student to barely being able to concentrate on my schoolwork, think critically, and retain information. On particularly stressful days, I would dissociate and feel like I was just floating through life without any motive, despite normally being a very goal-driven person. I would normally study and do schoolwork for several hours straight without interruption until I was satisfied with the outcome, but when dealing with brain fog, my mind would go completely blank and I would struggle to stay on task. I also had physical symptoms as well, like headaches and heavy fatigue. I notice that I’m better able to focus and remember things when I’m not under stress though. It just sucks going from being able to thrive under stress to being unable to even function under stress."
BrainFog,eymjzlm,t1_eykeuf1,1567211288.0,"I think I’ve only made one post here before, but I tend to lurk a lot 😅 If I do end up actually being diagnosed with PTSD, I think I can overcome it with proper treatment. It does make sense though, since my brain fog would get worse when I was under a ton of stress (which is plentiful while dealing with recurring depression and brain fog as a CS student 🙃 ) I’m just going to keep maintaining my health and working towards a solution and eventually I’ll get better. It really does suck that the causes and effects of brain fog can be so complex though, but it’s important to remember that the process of addressing the issue helps us to understand the intricacies of the human brain and body (or at least I think that’s a more positive way to look at the otherwise gloomy situation)."
DDlgAdvice,eymj5h9,t1_eylw2gw,1567210596.0,"I think business casual is a pretty good look because it’s not too dressy but it’s still flattering. I personally like business casual because it gives off a more authoritative vibe than casual dress, which is more reminiscent of a daddy (at least to me). There’s a lot more that goes into dressing well though, like choosing appropriate colors and dressing for your body type."

abusiverelationships,eyls5uh,t3_cxixd2,1567190711.0,"I remember one time my ex-boyfriend was on my college campus with me and we were heading back to my dorm. He was arguing with me for one reason or another (I can’t remember what it was) but basically he was trying to force me to do something I didn’t want to. He had a hold on my arm and I kept trying to get out of it but every time I tried, he made things worse. Eventually it got to the point at which I couldn’t take it anymore, so I started yelling, pulling my arm away,  hitting and pushing away from him to escape. I’m usually a very reserved person, so this kind of behavior is unusual for me. He ended up holding both of my arms and refusing to let me go, and he said I was crazy. He also said that I shouldn’t hit him because he could seriously injure me if he hit me back. He was 6’5” and muscular and I was 5’7” with noodles for arms. We were outside at night and it was mostly empty on campus where we were, but a few guys came up to us and asked what was going on. Of course he told them I was crazy, but I think they could tell something was wrong. 

The worst part is that similar situations happened several other times at other places. In another incident, a guy came up to me and asked if I was okay. A few days later while I was walking to class by myself, the same guy said hi to me and asked if everything was alright with me. I couldn’t remember him because I didn’t even make eye contact with him the last time I saw him. I just remember thinking that I hated that other people saw me and remembered me from those situations."

In terms of treatment, I don’t think cognitive dysfunction is targeted separately from the psychiatric disorders that cause it, so oftentimes people that ‘recover’ from severe disorders still struggle with cognitive dysfunction."

BDSMcommunity,ey1qpoh,t1_ey084i0,1566707757.0,"A major red flag is that he thinks ceasing contact with you / depriving you of communication for a week is a sufficient ‘punishment’ while you’re already dealing with so much. It’s really shitty in the context of a D/s relationship because you want to be able to emotionally connect with him and turn to him for support, but instead he’s ignoring you. This might not mean much to you, but I was in an abusive relationship and ignoring me for days and weeks while I really wanted to talk to him was a tactic that my ex-boyfriend used to get me to comply with whatever he wanted from me / control my behavior."
BrainFog,ey1nxrb,t3_cv0cpo,1566705128.0,I get really vivid nightmares relating to past trauma when I’m dealing with a lot of stress. I’m not sure vivid dreams are specifically related to brain fog though. I think I normally have vivid dreams anyways.

Mental illnesses are a different beast in comparison to other mostly physical ailments because they affect and are affected by human behavior and thoughts, but we should still be able to appropriately treat them as we learn more about their causes and effects. It sucks right now for people dealing with such disorders because the treatments are still really inadequate and as a result, it seems like there’s no hope for recovery. But we’re still making progress towards effective treatments, just as treatments were discovered for previously ‘incurable’ illnesses in the past. We’re just not there yet."

Something similar happened to me yesterday, except it was more like my parents were yelling at me for being depressed and I just cried in front of them for a while. It's really hard for me to tell them what's wrong because I tend to hold everything in and try to fix things myself, and they have never understood me enough for me to want to seek help from them. I'm not close to them in the slightest, either. Plus they tend to overreact to most things and yell at me, which I want to avoid. I think they're noticing that I've been extremely depressed lately and are willing to help me get treatment, which is nice. I really hate feeling like a burden to everybody though, which has also been holding me back from asking anybody close to me for support. I was feeling really suicidal and lonely, but it's nice to see that my parents want to help, even if they express it in a poor manner. I'm just going to try to focus on finding a suitable treatment option and ignoring the suicidal thoughts until they subside to make it through each day so I can have a fighting chance at accomplishing my goals.   
I wish you the best and I hope you can succeed too."

My symptoms and causes for my depression and brain fog are a bit different than yours, but I can understand and relate to your situation. It really sucks having to deal with the depression, the resulting brain fog, and then the worsening depression and anxiety as a result of stressing about the brain fog. 

I’m not really considering antidepressants right now and I think I should be exhausting all other possibly viable options before considering taking them because I reallyyyyy don’t want to make my brain fog worse, so hearing about your experiences has been really helpful. 

Thanks again for replying; I wish you the best and I hope you come closer to finding a solution."

It’s also really hot when he phrases requests as “do _____ for Daddy.” Actually, just hearing him request things from me in his commanding voice is a huge turn on. And I love it when he asks me “who owns you?” This list could go on forever but these are just a few things that come to mind."
