StopGaming,fiuyl11,t3_f9x6ov,1582750596.0,"Good decision. Stay positive, some people quit crack after 10 years of smoking and god knows how much money(also have to factor time loss considering that’s money) and they have no way to reverse damage. Consider yourself lucky, go make friends, focus on work or income and decide to take life seriously. Once you do these things and you remove yourself from what you aren’t, you’ll find you wish you quit sooner.

StopGaming,fa7e4g1,t3_e7raxf,1575833908.0,Guys honestly thank you so much you are proof there is still good in this world and this made me feel good thank you
ADHD,eywxx8w,t3_cz3eoo,1567540400.0,"Yeah. I have been really depressed as of late, not sadness but I think just hating the situation. No matter what I do I feel like things will never improve and it’s not fair, hate the effect it has on executive function etc."
depression,eyk6urx,t1_eyk6ia6,1567138821.0,"I just don’t know entirely I guess. Meeting a girl might be nice, it’s really hard to explain how I feel. Something is just simply not right."
ADHD,ex5s43n,t1_ex5rjzz,1566030694.0,Hey. Thank you so much for your reply. I think what I’m going to do is just tell him my concern truthfully and see if there is something he can figure out. What do you think about me quitting video games? I’m been addicted to them my whole life.
depression,evpt3mz,t3_ckmvf8,1564679756.0,"This might be the most accurate thing I have ever read. You leave feeling like you didn’t say what you wanted, and that makes you anxious and feel even more hopeless."
ADHD,eviv3gg,t1_eviuzut,1564550000.0,Good way to look at it but I swear I don’t have emotions so I think all good .
depression,evit14g,t1_evipl4e,1564548740.0,I’ll be here. I guess.
depression,evhtjda,t3_cjssjq,1564531956.0,"I know what you mean man. Sometimes after I’ve drank a lot and I’m at my worst I start to think like this after a bad hangover. Other times just sober, feel like wasted life and it’s shameful. I should be happy, focused, thinking about a wife and kids but here we are. I’m 25 and have been at this for 6 years now."

ADHD,eua1r8d,t1_eua1n1g,1563597858.0,"Not on meds. Took them as a child, stopped."
ADHD,eu9pw11,t3_cfeo92,1563587338.0,"I am happy for you that you are able to feel that way, how you described that makes me think your a good person so I hope your social anxiety gets better. I just hate how my life is playing out, definitely wouldn’t mind it being over just don’t wanna go through the process."
ADHD,eu9orrh,t1_eu9nd1i,1563586437.0,Can you argue you saw a legitimate change. I feel like I don’t have any feel good chemicals in my brain. Like going through life without a spark.
depression,et8n1qz,t1_et8mvs3,1562561848.0,"I think I do frequently empower a lot of negative thinking, self criticism. I think I do tell myself I hate who I am and wish I was different. I feel like there’s no way for me to change or get good feelings from new thinking."
