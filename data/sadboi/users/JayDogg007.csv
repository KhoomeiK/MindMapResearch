BipolarReddit,fqw1fgz,t1_fqv6vgq,1589690229.0,It did pretty much nothing to me too. Dr. Kept upping the dosage and I kept saying I didn‚Äôt feel any different. I think it‚Äôs just a placebo lol.

BipolarReddit,fqmytud,t3_gjsm23,1589485810.0,"I agree with you 100%. It‚Äôs a feeling that is actually truly awful. I can literally feel the depression wash over me. It feels like I‚Äôm content/indifferent one minute, then it feels like my head starts to tingle and I just get really sad. I can also compare it to a sleeping pill where it just hits you and you start to feel it. 

I feel it too, you‚Äôre not alone or weird."

BipolarReddit,fqcd3vd,t3_ghxcj6,1589255313.0,Ativan works the fastest and the best for me. If you really need them to kick in quicker during a bad panic attack put it under your tongue and just let it dissolve. It supposedly goes into your bloodstream faster.
depression,fqc6n3g,t3_gi0ihw,1589251222.0,"Excellent! I used to drive for Postmates as well. It's really not too bad of money depending on the market you're in and obviously how much people tip. Nothing beats a cash tip, I learned that while driving and I now always tip cash instead of leaving it on the card. Keep having some fun out there."

depression,fpy6lyh,t3_gg52e1,1588997140.0,"Please please please don‚Äôt do that. I was suicidal before and had to go to a psych ward for a while. It tore my parents to pieces. I saw my dad cry which I hardly ever saw. My mom told me that he cried himself to sleep when I was going through that. Talk to someone please, anyone, they WILL listen. This is a horrible horrible time for the world. You‚Äôre not alone."
depression,fpy6bea,t1_fpxkswf,1588996950.0,"I knew mine was clinical/major depressive disorder when nothing made me happy or even have emotion. It went on for months and months. Hated going outside during the day, didn‚Äôt want to see the sun. Felt comfortable and safe when it was dark and I was at home. Nothing made me happy, my sports teams winning, listening to music that I previously loved, sex/masturbation/porn meant nothing. I stopped eating very much, lost a lot of weight and needed some new jeans and pants because my old ones just slid off. It‚Äôs hell, trust me you would know. 

Then that just snowballed into what I‚Äôd think was I to cases of minor psychosis. Mind was all over, thinking illogical crazy shit. Paranoid as hell, thinking I was being followed. This actually does still happen to me, but since I‚Äôve been on meds it‚Äôs been less, but the meds also fuck hardcore with my brain and personality too. Double edged sword - go crazy without meds, or stay a little less crazy but experience a change in who you are/were."
BipolarReddit,fpripd0,t1_fpqoo5j,1588855145.0,"It would depend on the personality of the SO. Some people are very open to discussion, some are more closed and cutoff to that subject. I would absolutely prefer them to ask if I was hinting at something or if there was something I needed to tell them. From there, I would gauge their reaction and hopefully they would be receptive lol."
BipolarReddit,fpqmstx,t3_gezi2t,1588826549.0,"I don‚Äôt have a SO at the moment. I‚Äôve always kind of hinted things during conversations like ‚Äúmental health is finally being addressed. So many people are medicated you wouldn‚Äôt think are.‚Äù I think it dropped hints on some girls minds I‚Äôve dated, and possibly pushed them away. Never straight up told one yet"

BipolarReddit,fpf0w9o,t1_fp8gaxz,1588559218.0,"So happy that our bodies have bounced back from the antipsychotics. I can‚Äôt get girls either on them lol. I‚Äôd say just stay far away from the antipsychotics and give some of the other psych meds a try. I‚Äôve been through a lot of combos, it just takes time to find something that you can manage and live with. 

I feel like mine have helped me a bit, but only in a sort of ‚Äútake the edge off‚Äù kind of way. I just wonder what I‚Äôve sacrificed for that small relief..."
BipolarReddit,fp8e12i,t1_fp8bj48,1588389945.0,"Wow, are you an MD of some sort? That was a very deeply analyzed response. Thank you very much for your input. 

I take the Adderall because I‚Äôve been threatened at work with being fired because very often I have trouble concentrating and remembering work related things. I‚Äôm in the finance world so I‚Äôm at a desk all day. I told my psych about the possibility of losing my job because of the brain fog. She told me we could try the Adderall and it did/does work. I try not to take it on the weekends (unless I have to work) so as to hopefully not become addicted to them. I don‚Äôt feel the ‚Äúneed‚Äù to take them on the weekends, so I think that‚Äôs a decent revelation at the moment. 

I find your theory on the Dopamine ends are burning. I have read that the receptors over time can die or become less active with the continued use. 

As for the antipsychotics, I tried each of Seroquel, Geodon, and ariprozole (sp) for a a time period of about 2 years. All I did was eat, eat, eat and sleep, sleep, sleep. I put on massive weight and my BP went very high triggering the possibility of me having to go BP meds in addition. Then I developed the involuntary body movements which again, also proposed another medication to co trip that. 

To be honest, this cocktail that I‚Äôm on is the best combination I‚Äôve had over the past 15 years or so I‚Äôve been on psych meds. It‚Äôs been a love/hate, yes/no, good/bad relationship ever since. 

Thanks for your input and analysis."

BipolarReddit,fp8a476,t1_fp89mgr,1588387273.0,"I agree, but I also miss the person that I feel that I used to be without any of the medication and their side effects. I feel dead inside quite often. It‚Äôs almost like a dream that I‚Äôm watching from the sidelines."
BipolarReddit,fp8874z,t3_gbx5zm,1588385957.0,"Ugh, same here. Without the cocktails we‚Äôre a mess. Perfect pharmaceutical drug addicts."
