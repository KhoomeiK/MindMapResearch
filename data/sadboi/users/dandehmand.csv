You can tell there's a backstory to this character. I would suggest blending the bases of the horns a bit more, and perhaps even darkening the color of the horns to give it a stronger contrast. Some shading around the nose and the cheeks might make it pop more and look more defined. But I really like this look, it's creepy as hell. Well done!"

Despite being a deep sleeper, I snapped wide awake a couple hours before dawn. The house was completely silent, there was nothing that triggered me to wake up at all. Within a second of waking up I thought to myself “I have a feeling something very bad is about to happen right now.” Within a second of having that thought, the house started to shake. The date was January 17. The time was 4:30 am. We were in Los Angeles. It was the Northridge earthquake. I still don’t understand."

Makeup,fkwqr4j,t3_fkgqb7,1584601839.0,"Hello there! I'm in the same boat. I just rebooted my entire life to become a makeup artist, and I'm pushing 40 years old, so...it's kinda scary. What are your skills? What are you looking to do? Do you want to stick to beauty or are you cool to branch out to FX and hair? Do you want to do film and TV or runway or headshots or photoshoots? I'd say decide on that first and proceed from that point. There are plenty of resources online, but I would recommend either looking into a school or hooking up with makeup artists and trying to intern with them, which is what I'm going to be doing soon. I've also been told that working on student films is a really great entrance point. Are there any film schools or colleges around you that you can link up with? Do you have business cards or a website? I've been finding that you really have to pimp yourself out and get your name out there so you can gain experience and keep working. I don't know what the makeup/film/TV/beauty industry is like in Florida, but I know you're not too terribly far from Georgia and there is a lot of stuff filming there! Same with Louisiana and North Carolina. It's a tough industry from what I've heard, with long hours and cranky clients, but if it's what you want to do, if it's what you love, then it's better than being miserable doing what you hate. That's my philosophy. Come up with a plan of what you want to do, research your area and see what you can do for it, ands focus like crazy on achieving what you want! There's good money involved but you (and I!) are going to have to pay our dues and suffer a bit until we get to that spot. I don't know if this helped, I hope it did, but if there's anything else you want to talk about, please let me know. Absolute best of luck!"
