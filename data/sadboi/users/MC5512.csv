depression,f0kr37l,t1_f0kqane,1568685917.0,"I understand that. I have tried xanex and just feel tired and zoned out. I wonder what other prns are out there. I have been through a lot of other medications and have settled on my daily meds but with those days where it is just a little too much to handle, Tramadol keeps me calm (emotionally, no crying and all that). Any other meds I could ask about? I don’t think my doctor likes the idea of a prn (as needed) med anyway. 
I keep going back and forth from “this med really does help, why I should I feel bad about it” to “I am probably just an addict in training and haven’t figured it out yet. Thanks for any insight"

depression,f0enuz1,t3_d2pnl8,1568570980.0,"I have totally felt this, and still do a lot. My therapist told me I was a a log floating down the river of life and I never realized. Life was on the banks and I was just floating by, 10 years of floating. Now I can get on the banks for times but I can’t see to stay there.
I feel most like myself when I take Tramadol which isn’t the most common anti-depressant. It was actually for a knee injury but now I take when I am I a dark/cloudy space and it helps and I feel most like myself, motivated, focused and happy. Am I an addict?"
