the notion of a good life is heavily loaded in the modern age. It's ideologically shaped to approve capitalist life style, maximizing consumption while making sure that ever more increasing amount of value can be extracted from the working people. Not here to talk about politics, however; if you do not reconsider what is good life, you'll only find yourself at fault.

Since you are well educated and smart, use this to your advantage. Rephrase your question: Howcome ""good life"" can't make me happy, what's wrong with ""good life""?

You'll find a large disconnect between what's generally pleasing and peaceful for humans versus the general image of a good life in public's conscience.

Then, go on to discover your own good life and live it. You are lucky. You have means to live it."

In some way, you already mentioned a solution on your own. It isn't a sexual thing. While women can be difficult to approach in a sexual/emotional manner, they are far more approachible in a social manner, as you can imagine.

If you get a social environment where you'll have adequate communication with women, i guess you'll worries will lessen.

If you seek writing as a career, that's nice but it seems like you are too fragile to do it right now. Instead, focus on getting better. You can try serious writing later in your life.

You should really consider wheter a writer's life, a writer's state of mind is the thing you need for your life right now.

Now the great middle east project is failed, they dont need turkey to have an islamic facade to serve as their trojan horse into middle east. So the west supports ""progressives"" in turkey. Since erdogan-west breakup ataturk is on the rise in AKP imagery, beacuse they found themselves as the keeper of all things that support turkish independence.

So either you (and possibly his future relationships) will dump him until he quits demanding mothering, or you'll fix it now.

As a person who's been accussed of being a robot many many times (computer engineer here), I discovered this is the real reasoning behind their complaint. They think there is something about you that you are holding back. She doesn't demand that you act irrationally on a certain timetable to appease her thirst for variation. That would be the most rational thing to do if you took her words literally. And it seems you did so. No, she doesn't demand random variation, she demands to see what she believes that you are holding back. Most people don't psychoanalyse their own feelings to be able to describe them accurately. That's why you can't take people's comments about their own feelings at face value.

It's hard to ensure a person that you are really rational inside out, and it's even harder to come up with concrete proof for your own sake. People like us usually have a dirty baggage of overlooked emotions hidden somewhere and have built a life around rational behaviour. you'll think it's to risky to act emotionally.
