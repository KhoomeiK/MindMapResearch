Anxiety,er74lw6,t3_c0s06i,1560566821.0,"I used to feel that way all the time. I honestly don't remember when or why it stopped.

Let's say you have a broken leg. You can't walk on it and you're visibly in a lot of discomfort, then over time it heals and stops hurting. Does the fact that you can walk again mean it was never broken in the first place? Mental disorders are just as valid as physical ones.

Please just remember that you are worthy of happiness. Anxiety doesn't define who you are, so why shouldn't you get some happy moments? Depression and anxiety can be crippling and sometimes a lifelong struggle, but they aren't fixed characteristics. You are not your anxiety. You are not your depression. You deserve to be happy!!"

Anxiety,er5cd5a,t1_er5c2of,1560523038.0,"Also to answer your question, yeah. I'm barely an adult since I'm 19 but I'm at this place mentally that really sucks. I relapsed last year and lost so much ground I had regained. It makes it so much harder because i KNOW i can overcome the fears and i KNOW they're usually unfounded. You'd think it would motivate me to get better again but honestly the idea of having to ""start over"" doesn't even feel possible."

Agoraphobia,er42e2o,t3_c06u75,1560479266.0,"You're not alone. I wish you weren't going through this because I know how horrible it is. I'm so glad you're reaching out on here and I'm so proud of you! It takes courage to really face how you're feeling and even more to share it with other people.

 I havent been to a therapist or counselor in over a year because I basically cant leave the house for anything. Right now I've found the only thing that really helps me get through panic is to (a) DO NOT FIGHT THE PANIC. I have to basically force my body into being as relaxed as I can in the situation, definitely doesn't work as much as I'd like but it gets me through the at-home panic attacks. (b) imagine my happy place. Instead of giving in to the urge to physically escape, I mentally escape by thinking like ""it'll be so nice when this is over. I'll have a nice glass of water and watch the office."" I've been walking to the store by myself a few times and it REALLY helps me not to run out of the store. 

I think what a lot of people and therapists don't understand is how easily and quickly your comfort zone can shrink, even if you've spent years growing it. I wish there was a quick fix."
Anxiety,eqvy8qb,t3_bzq60q,1560351036.0,"I once drove two hours to a mall just to throw up in the bathroom and immediately go home. You're definitely not alone. I read somewhere that its part of your body's fight or flight response basically being like ""let's chuck all this extra food so we're lighter for when we need to run!"" I'm so sorry you're going through this :("
Anxiety,eqtitsw,t3_bzloy6,1560312505.0,"Anxiety is such a common thing for people to struggle with these days that I think doctors kind of HAVE to take it seriously. I totally get why you're concerned about people not believing you, but even the fact that you're scared to go to the doctor is enough to show that you're really struggling. Does that make sense lol

I have an appointment next week that I'm really scared of but I find it helps to remind myself that the doctors office is probably the most convenient place to have a panic attack. They're there to help you and they want to see you get better. You deserve to get better!! You deserve help! Try taking baby steps towards an appointment. Some doctors even do phone consultations if you think going to the office is too much. The fact that you're reaching out on here is so brave and I'm proud of you. Anxiety IS hard and it's not just something that you can sleep off, but you don't have to suffer alone. üíú"
