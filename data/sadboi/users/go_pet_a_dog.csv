depression,fes7pl6,t3_eqc90a,1579362233.0,"Felt this way my whole life, can try to provide a new perspective (maybe? idk). When I was 16 I got diagnosed with Hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness) and also enjoy art (sorry for shit formatting I‚Äôm on mobile).

TLDR: When you want to break out of it for a little while here‚Äôs what worked for me in order of accessibility - meds, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), peer support, and little steps.

Meds - Prescribed* Adderall to stay awake and focused and CBD to help calm depression judging myself in my head because I‚Äôd get stressed about being in bed not doing things. Caffeine in excess also works but has long term digestive damage
*I say prescribed for legal  and medical reasons. Take too much and you‚Äôll freak out, take too little and it won‚Äôt work 

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - Downloadable as apps to your electronic device. It‚Äôll walk you through questions and over time helped me kinda rewire the pathways that got stuck in the tired routine when I needed to

Peer Support - Check out the folks at r/insomnia,  they‚Äôre going through the same things and can help provide solutions you may not have heard yet. I‚Äôve been there for awhile and just hearing from other people made me want to try new things

Little Steps - Sounds so dumb when I write it out but honestly break down your art or desired activity into the smallest of steps. For art I‚Äôll think to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get my materials out today, prepare them tomorrow, and then paint one base coat the next day.‚Äù Once I got my hands on my materials and had an escape plan it made it easier to just give art a try even if I am sleepy

I teach at a university and the advice I always give my students is to get their required readings done in the morning so it‚Äôs not hanging over their head the rest of the day. Other tips for getting through/mastering this sucker include reading the first and last sentence of each paragraph before starting the chapter, taking notes on what you don‚Äôt understand and diving deeper once you‚Äôve completed reading the parts you do understand, and then making flashcards to cement the harder to grasp concepts into your brain. Setting weekly goals/rewards for yourself will help you stay on track as well as writing down a list of why this knowledge matters to you will both help get you through tough times. You‚Äôve got this and I hope at least a piece of this helps :)"

If you have access to healthcare and time to see a doctor, you could possibly get meds which I‚Äôve tried before but you‚Äôve got to watch that you don‚Äôt get stuck needing meds to stay awake and to fall asleep. Depending on your feelings during your awake time, a doctor could give you medicine that might help at least alleviate those symptoms (sleepy during the day, low concentration, more depression, so on) and make your experience more bearable.

WizardsUnite,et8wmsb,t1_et8hxzn,1562573935.0,"On single potion use for traces my fellow fan, we certainly agree. I mean c‚Äômon. 

But I don‚Äôt play Wizards Unite to simulate real life... it‚Äôs supposed to be a whimsical game, that fans and others can enjoy, without feeling like they need to pay money to participate - which is how the game has been marketed (but is proving to not be true for a large amount of players). We‚Äôve heard on this subreddit about the lack of opportunities to gain casting power at inns (spell power returns of 3 consistently at ~29 inns was posted within the last 24hrs on this sub), this isn‚Äôt a new problem for players that cannot afford to pay to play. A video game should not allow you to use a monetized item that you cannot execute in gameplay at the level of a free app download trying to market to new users. 

It just comes down to the disagreement that the game is not meant to simulate life. Very few  (a full 2) of my HP friends will play Wizards Unite with me because of the aggressive monetization and the lack of opportunity to find traces or to use limited spell power when they find them due to limited initial spell casting storage. I agree we can all be as vigilant as we are in the non-gaming world while gaming, but I don‚Äôt think that lives up to the GO but for HP fans pitch that we got originally and what got me interested in the first place. However, I wish you the best of luck with cheese handling and spell casting in the future!"

AdobeIllustrator,eqrhh4j,t1_eqraf1b,1560261055.0,"Hello! Awesome design and congrats on the iPad.

Adobe Illustrator Draw for the iPad integrates seamlessly with Illustrator on the desktop which is why I use it whenever I need to create a simple or more organic vector design. To answer your question about streamlined brushes, I haven‚Äôt found anything vector for the iPad that streamlined a brush like Procreate (a .psd iPad app) can. An iPad Procreate design needs to be vectorized (takes seconds) in Illustrator. The initial tracing can be jagged but you can finesse and refine it exactly how you like it by using the direct selection and smooth tools. I personally have gotten the results like what it sounds like you‚Äôre looking for from using this method. Both apps are incredibly fun and I hope some of this is helpful!"
