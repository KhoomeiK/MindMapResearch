Over where I am, schizophrenic or psychotic is used as a common insult used to refer to an evil person or someone who is 'insane' or sadistic. When I was in the hospital (1rst and 2nd hospitalization), other patients were afraid of me. I see how society portrays schizos in media and it makes me sad to think of how little understood the disorder is. There is also the commonly held thought that schizos are dangerous and unpredictable. It seems as if society doesn't remember we're humans too. For those sorts of reasons, I don't talk about my schizophrenia outside of these sorts of communities, my psychiatrist, and my therapist. I  try not to dwell on the issue you are talking about too often, but it comes up on my mind from time to time."

otherkringe,fqnf8ne,t1_fpyavko,1589493790.0,"As somebody once said about chicken periods, 

**“Menstrual cycle:**  The monthly cycle of changes in the ovaries and the lining of the  uterus (endometrium), starting with the preparation of an egg for  fertilization. When the follicle of the prepared egg in the ovary  breaks, it is released for fertilization and ovulation occurs. Unless  pregnancy occurs, the cycle ends with *the shedding of part of the endometrium, which is menstruation.*” - [Definition of Menstrual cycle](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7865) from MedicineNet; emphasis added.

That’s what happens in humans. If you read through this description of how chicken eggs form - [Avian Reproductive System—Female - eXtension](https://articles.extension.org/pages/65372/avian-reproductive-systemfemale)  \- you will see that hens don’t have an endometrium which forms and then  is shed. They simply release eggs from their ovary, sometimes but not  always fertilize them, form a shell around the egg, and pass the  completed egg - fertilized or unfertilized - out of their body.

Chickens don’t have periods."

2.) How medication affects you may depend on the person. For me, it gets rid of the majority of my hallucinations, it gets rid of my delusions, my thinking is a little bit better, my mood is more appropriate, paranoia is reduced, etc. There are a couple of things meds haven't fixed for me, but I am cool with the meds I have.

3.) The medication I'm on costs around $1,500 per bottle (1 month supply). I originally took 80mg, but I had an episode around February that lasted until I got intervention in March and that intervention included changing my dose to 120mg.

4.) I have been on multiple anti-psychotics. The thing I hate probably the most is the weight gain. I am pretty self-conscious about it now. A common side effect is nausea and vomiting.

casualiama,fov8er7,t1_fou304p,1588097067.0," 1.)   It's mostly group therapy and the occasional break. As well as meals. There was a thing called ""quiet time,"" it was basically a time where you can get some alone time in your room. And yes, there were constant checks from staff. They were normally checking every 5 minutes. Although I did something that made the staff do ""line of sight"" with me. That means a staff member stays with me the entire time. If I was in my room they would get a chair to sit on and sit in the doorway and watch me the entire time. They watched me during therapy groups, meals, whenever I was in my room, etc. And they would stand outside the doorway of the bathroom if I were showering or going to the bathroom. Here is a rough schedule for the hospital I was talking about:

7:15 am- Wake up and get vital signs taken and get in the shower.

7:30 am- Breakfast and meds if it applies to you.

8:00 am- Therapy group(s). There were a bunch of therapy groups and the occasional break. This goes on for most of the day. There's also lunch and dinner. There is something called quiet time where you have some time to be alone in your room. Sometimes you would do fun activities after groups and on Saturdays, we got to watch a movie. 

As for the other hospital I went to (I was admitted to the first hospital 3 times), their schedule was more simple.

Wake up

Breakfast

Sit around doing nothing for a long time

therapy group that lasts a little more than 30 minutes

Sit around and do nothing for a long time.

Dinner

Do nothing for a few minutes.

Do a very short therapy group.

Go to sleep.

Repeat.

2.) In the hospital I went to 3 times I had a private room. In the other one I had a roommate. So it depends on the hospital

3.) The region where patients stay depends on their gender. Females and males are separated.  If a patient doesn't identify as either gender, they are put in the section for the gender they were born with.

4.) I am doing ok now. I had an episode recently, but I'm getting better. I have been stable for weeks now. So I guess I can say I am ok."

 I was admitted And I was not very aware that there was mentally something wrong with me. I was not in a good spot mentally, but I didn’t think there was anything wrong with me. My awareness was roughly 1. 2 at most.
