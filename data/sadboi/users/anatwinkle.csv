You are loved and sometimes we are not lucky with the family we don't choose for ourselves. You are really young and I  can tell you are mature. I believe maybe  soon you'll can get out of that house and build a nice community of Friends that will be there for you and defiantlely come to your birthday party that you organize youself.

Happy birthday!"

I don't have kids but I would say to always make sure they know you are proud of them and make them feel they are effective smart people. Even for the smallest things and especially the big things.
Nobody said a word or hugged me when I got into UC Berkleley, my dad did say ' thats a hard school, you gonna have to work hard.'
My life right now, if not evident from my story, is so hopeless, the conflict with my family just keeps getting worse and they won't empathize with or internalize my situation. I really dont know what to do. thanks."

kratom,ev14802,t3_chy07z,1564151985.0,"I'm a relative newbie... about 3 months and I kind of regret ordering too much white bc I haven't figured out if its has a positive or negative effect. I use kratom for mood.

I found that white doesnt exactly give me anxiety, but a weird kind of subtle dark irritability. on the positive side, I also think whites give me better focus. I'm hoping that the irritability part will dissipate as I take more and my body adjusts.... and mixing whites with greens or red also had a much better overall feeling."
kratom,eueijo2,t1_euehtpv,1563745246.0,thank you for the recommendation . you've lived thru hell ... i feel cursed too... i also try to remember that things are impermanent and can get better :)
kratom,eudtro6,t1_euczvee,1563727311.0,"That's a very powerful statement...her family pushed her to the edge by being ignorant. 

I am in your boat and I am in your friend's boat. I cant count how many years I've been on benzos.. more then 10 I believe.. the addiction is so strong i will not tell anybody ,especially doctors , how much I take. at this point, psychiatrists are useless,  both in knowledge and in concern . 

I've been depressed all my life and I don't know anything different but in the past 6 years , I have lost everything and everyone because I'm depressed , which is my fault and also bc people are ignorant, all those who's love you expected unconditionally, are ignorant . the only ppl I have is my family , well my parents.. I'm 38 and they will never learn not to treat me like a freak. I literally have achieved a lot in my life , even for non depressed standards, but all I hear is criticism. to the extent that they tell me I cant even handle having a dog. I had a dog for 8 years! it's an impossible situation . I can only rely on myself  , but that's not really working out for me .. I must be  mentally strong for myself and also the burden of my families harshness, its too much.

 the only time I tried to commit suicide was when I lived with them a few years ago. I cannot ever live with them again but I cant get a job to pay my rent...and my CEO brother wont help me in any way. I have held jobs responsibly my whole adult life but now I am deemed incapable by the only ppl in my life.

 I'm trying  the kratom route to stop with benzos. I also am still trying to get my routine down. I have high tolerance and get upset stomachs tho it helps now and then which is a kind of miracle. its unpredictable,.....  now I dont understand if it's me or the benzo withdrawal that is driving me insane. I almost ended it yesterday. my mom has cancer and I hurt her feeling by explaining my feeling bc she asked me 'what's wrong ' and then I  became "" evil ""...does that happen to anyone ?

now my family went on vacation and i feel pretty darn good right now."

depression,esettjg,t3_c7ff6h,1561909340.0,"sister:)

yes hes always seen me as annoying and inferior, but then again nobody in my family can deny that hes an egomaniac. they've said it before many times ,  just not in my situation. 

I cant be without a family. and the guilt they put on me for being angry. they're all I have . I tried to escape them and went to the USA again, then a ton of bricks hit me.  I moved to Italy and lived there 2 years to escape them but the depression does not disappear just bc you change location. 
and i would do anything for them and they treat me like I'm mentally handicapped, after all my accomplishments.  I  need to stop listening to.them but I'm conditioned to.


thanks ;)"
depression,eset4xs,t1_eserheg,1561908834.0,"All I can say is that that is my BROTHER. you're right the money part doesn't matter, i honestly wrote that so ppl will read . 

when he came to Israel, he had no place to stay. I was Renting an apartment with a spare room that happened to be free. I offered for him to live with me till he got his shit together. we lived together for 6 months .

total strangers tell me to send them my CV when I day I'm unemployed. Israelis are very warm people.  families are very tight. my parents ate form israel and we were immigrants. 

it is a hard pill to swallow that ur own brother will stab u in the back, and not do something so easy for him , that would change your life. you have to be a sociopath to be like that. 

ya I get I'm on my own, and im not asking for handouts.....my sister also has a lot of connections , but I ask her for nothing bc it's not even close to my brother. 

 but when you are debilitating depressed..its normal ask or help family.   

Im not functioning right now nor can I even work legally bc of a legal battle with a past  company which would have never happened if my bro would have just sent some emails. 15 years ago, he did send an email for me to his CEO  friend.. they Interviewed me and hired me and i worked there for 3 years ( that's a lot in hi tech) and I helped that company grow.
 
I refuse to give into this mentality that your own brother cant be bothered to help you basically save your life"
