Anxiety,fp6pw9u,t1_fp6bzhe,1588356542.0,"Pretty sure that OP, like many of us, recognize that our anxiety is irrational. I’m also pretty sure OP recognizes and empathizes that many people are suffering during this time. Emotions are complex and they aren’t black and white, especially anxiety. It may even be possible that OP is feeling guilty over feeling like they don’t want  quarantine to end knowing that others are suffering. 

I personally have anxiety about going back to normal because I feel less stressed during this quarantine. It does NOT mean, however, that I’m blatantly ignoring the fact that people are seriously suffering during this time. In fact, I’ve monetarily donated as much I can to those in need. Just because I have anxiety about going back to normal does NOT mean that I lack perspective, and the same goes for OP. 

I’m sorry to say that It’s your comment that is black and white and lacks perspective."
TwoXChromosomes,fomx4hk,t3_g7zygq,1587906531.0,"Hi OP. 

I had vulvodynia. I went through rounds of medication (which helped) and PT (which helped) and ultimately had surgery (which helped tremendously). 

Long story short - there are SO many options to help get you through this! Best of luck!"

Because of this flare though, and how bad it got, he’ll now be on steroids (1x a day), antivirals (2x a day), steroid eye drops (2x a day), and nasal decongestant drops (2x a day) everyday for the rest of his life. He’s also on cat antidepressants and Xanax in addition to everything else. Thank god for pill pockets, my patience, and his willingness to be a garbage disposal and eat anything."
