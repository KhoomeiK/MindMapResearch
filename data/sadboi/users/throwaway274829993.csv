BPD,etnal69,t3_ccjchq,1562981494.0,"Yes, yes, yes! I was worried I was the only one. I'm sure it has something to do with the unstable sense of identity. I can remember a few distinct times I felt like a completely different person after doing something like reading a book."
BPD,etlcr52,t3_cc9q0l,1562932139.0,"In my mind, abuse needs to be intentional. I'm not sure if that's technically true, but I know what it's like to let things get carried away like that. I remember when my best friend called me emotionally abusive, that crushed me for about two months. Don't give in if you really dont believe you did anything wrong, I'd just acknowledge the things that she interpreted that way, and acknowledge her right to feel her feelings. It's the most fair and balanced way imo. Either way I wish you luck!"

offmychest,etl7ilp,t3_cc8hun,1562925579.0,"Depression feels like your soul decided to wander off, and it left the rest of you behind. I spent ten years like that, like I was watching a really sad movie, with my eyes glazed over. I can relate to that. The days when I couldn't even leave my bed were many. The days that I didn't eat were more numerous. I dont know if it's your cup of tea, but I'm here to talk if you want. I don't believe anyone should have to suffer alone unless that's what they want. Even if not, I do want to tell you something. It gets better. It's a cliche thing to say, but lately the sun seems to shine for me again, and if I can escape that dark valley, I believe anyone can. I wish you only the best."
