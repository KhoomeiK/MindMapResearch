BPD,fqhy18h,t3_gj1nob,1589386568.0,"Yes. I’m away from home now and sometimes I would just tell my friend I want to go home. But at the same time, I actually don’t want to go home because it’s too cold and dramatic a household to be called ‘home’."
BPD,foz7ajy,t1_foy9kw3,1588185875.0,"Honestly I have been doing this, I moved house every half a year. I tried to go to different places as much as I could, like my whole purpose for working is just so I could go somewhere. I’m in Germany now and it was fine for while but I could really feel my problems coming back and I’m in a really poor mental state right now despite telling myself that I am better and getting better."
