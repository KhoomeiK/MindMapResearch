Vape_Sales,fe5vcr2,t3_elvoap,1578875781.0,Shops generally buy wholesale especially with companies like smok so it's highly probable that your power setting is way off on the gold one and thats why it isnt working correctly. also check the pod if you've been using the same one because even when you change the coils in a nord the pod itself may be gunked up and burning because of it.
mentalhealth,f5tl1zt,t3_dp8hga,1572460713.0,"I’m sorry but I completely disagree. I think social media and memes generalize it a lot and when people say things that seem like “oh look at me I’m so sad” could literally mean that they are trying to express their depression, and it’s uncalled for to shame them as such. I know this for a fact because I wore all black and blasted my chemical romance all throughout high school and most of college. The reason I think this group is so important is because it brings social cohesiveness to a society that really encourages people to be all about themselves and no one else. Lack of social cohesiveness is commonly referred to as the main cause of increased suicide rates in first world countries. Lack of cohesiveness can be defined by a society, in general, feeling alone, without strong ties to a group, usually religious,  

My point is, they are trying to deal with their stuff and this is just their expression. Let them be or if you are in a place to help you can try to do so. People nowadays are just lonely and they want to belong somewhere, don’t shame them for it please."
mentalhealth,f43ozl2,t3_dj7fwb,1571343769.0,"Just thought I’d like to share something with you. In early June of this year, I found out that my now ex-fiancée was cheating on me with one of my best friends. This lead to a downward spiral of my emotions and bad habits. 

I had made the realization at this point that there are so many things in life I was holding back from because of my relationship, and I was determined to not let anyone get in the way of me being my best possible version of myself.

About a month before we split up, I told myself that I wanted to lose weight, because it was affecting my work and daily life. At this point I was 240 lbs, or about 109kg. Until I left, this was just another empty promise to myself. The day that I left our old apartment I started working out every day of the week, for the entire summer. During this time, I eventually learned how to eat and exercise healthily, and reapplied to university. 

A few weeks ago, 4 months after I started my journey, I’m now 195 lbs(88kg.) I cant say that I was perfect, because the first 2 months after my incident I was highly suicidal and I barely ate at all. Also, my drug problems had started to get worse during that point this summer. 

For a very unexpected reason, exercise is the reason I am alive right now. It’s a horrible way to think and I wish that no one will ever experience this, but my suicidal ideations were always shut down by the thought of, “if I die now, I’m a fat failure who could never succeed in anything I wanted to do.”

After a while, my journey transformed from me hating my stomach obsessively to having a healthy routine that gave me structure(also the serotonin release from working out is great.)

I’d like to give a few pointers if you have read this far haha

1) Don’t have the mindset of a number. Your doctor told you to lose weight not because a number is too high, but because they feel you are unhealthy. Your goal should be to live a healthy lifestyle and the kg will come with time.

2) Eating less is not the goal. Eating right is the goal. There are many different diets for different body types, metabolisms, and personal goals. I personally used the keto diet, because it allowed me to eat as much as I want as long as it fit within my daily carb allowance.

3) Exercise is very important. Exercise is only about 15-25% of losing weight, but i personally feel that people who start healthy habits because they are overweight gain much more than that. Exercise increases your metabolism rate, therefore conditioning your body to burn more calories. When a person loses weight quickly extra skin that has not elasticized to your body is loose, and can really be demoralizing after all of your hard work. Muscle mass fills in these gaps where fat was, to make you look muscular, rather than “saggy.”

That’s the end of my rant. If you have any questions about anything I mentioned, feel free to message me! 

P.S. I haven’t written that all down yet haha so thanks for the outlet as well I guess :P"
