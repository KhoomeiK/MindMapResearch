As you can see, the join between the 2 is very messy indeed, as is the join between the concrete and gravel textures at the top left of the picture. And this seems to happen all the time; it's like there's a small grass edge to the texture that makes joins with other surfaces really messy.

Am I doing something wrong, or is there a way around this or a way to avoid it or something? I really like the mod, but things like this look so ugly and I don't know how to change it!"

amiga,f0r7agk,t3_d4edmi,1568875858.0,"I'd been tempted by this for my newly-acquired 600, since I'm thinking of going down a dual kickstart with it, but I'd only seen it advertised for the 500 and 2000. Have you found it works ok with your 600?"
patientgamers,f03vrui,t3_d3dh17,1568372126.0,"Great question, but one I'm struggling with! Here are my answers - for now:

**(Silly) Putty (Amiga)**: A great game (though somewhat overlooked these days), but this is as much about how I got this as the game itself: this was in the ""Wild, Weird and Wicked"" pack I got with my Amiga 600 when I was 13 and was the first game I played on that computer. I'd wanted an Amiga for years and was so chuffed when I'd finally saved up enough paper round money to buy one. I remember my dad sitting on the bus with the box on his  lap; then as soon as we got home I was straight in, plugging it into the telly and settling down for a game of Putty with the joystick Dixons (former UK electronics chain) had given me for free.

**Sonic The Hedgehog (Mega Drive/Genesis)**: I actually prefer Sonic 2 to the original. However, some of us Amiga owners could be a bit... condescending towards the console opposition; Sonic was the game that made me think, ""part of me would quite like a Mega Drive"". Didn't get one till about 3 years ago, though. 

**SimCity 4 (PC)**: Oh my goodness, the time I've spent with this. I'd played SimCity games before and loved them. But this was the one that truly got me hooked, that I sank hundreds of hours into. Also the first game that I used any mods for. Cities Skylines is now my most-played game, and I find it hard to go back to SC4 now for more than a short period of time. But that obsession stems from this obsession. 

**The Sims 2 (PC)**: First game I pre-ordered (only other one was Tomb Raider: Legend) and I played the heck out of it for ages. This version has so much charm, humour (without the forced wackiness that's sometimes prevalent in number 4), personality and joy. Plus, it was such a step-up from the original that it was genuinely exciting and almost jaw-dropping to play. My favourite game of the series. 

**Pro Evo Soccer 3 (PS2)**: I am crap at football games (though yesterday I managed to get Hull City to come back from 3-1 down against Man City to win 5-3 in the FA Cup quarter final in FIFA 18), but I also get quite addicted to them. I played this loads on the PS2 and still have fond memories of taking my Master League version of Real Madrid from zeroes to heroes, pulling off amazing victories and fantastic goals. Yes, I played it on easy mode and no, I don't care (I still play FIFA 18 on semi-pro mode). 

Honourable mentions perhaps to Zool on the Amiga (first game I ever completed, though I did use cheats), Euro Truck Simulator 2 (the only open-ended game I've only got one save file for) and Burnouts 2 and 3 (for convincing me that, though I'm no petrol-head, I do love driving/racing games)."
