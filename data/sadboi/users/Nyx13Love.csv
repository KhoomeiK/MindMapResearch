askwomenadvice,fmiovxq,t1_fma614x,1586113916.0,you made a typo you meant to type i am strong for posting this* because strong people admit their flaws and are always trying to improve themselves....good day 😘
askwomenadvice,fma2c98,t1_fm5iphg,1585882090.0,"i’m the weird one? lol, ok...."
askwomenadvice,fma29ju,t1_fm56yjw,1585882039.0,man up? what a stupid term. i’m a woman who is strong and grieving. what’s not normal is numbing your feelings and thinking that’s being tough. also i was not whining i was asking if anyone experienced anything similar. are your brain cells on vacation right now?
askwomenadvice,fma21io,t1_fm5h87b,1585881889.0,wow i’m surprised too....it fucking sucks but i know we will heal eventually and deserve better. best of luck <3
askwomenadvice,fm8cv5h,t1_fm44nct,1585847079.0,thank you so much for your response :) 💜 i feel less weird knowing i’m not alone and so many people relate haha. take care!
askwomenadvice,fm8crjl,t1_fm4yu6e,1585847026.0,"thank you for sharing your experience with me. i’m sorry that you’re going through this as well.

it’s hard not to be hard on ourselves when we go through something like a break up but i relate to your response because i too can’t be physical with someone i do not love and sex is a very deep emotional experience for me. 

i did love him and instead of thinking about where i went wrong i’m going to remind myself that i was the best person i could be to him and that my feelings and intentions were nothing but real and pure. 

take care!"
askwomenadvice,fm8c8xo,t1_fm4ezsj,1585846750.0,exactly!! it is very weird feeling. i was honestly so confused the first time it happened..
askwomenadvice,fm8c66a,t1_fm40k9b,1585846710.0,"i can’t believe how many people relate, i thought i was the only one."
askwomenadvice,fm8bxrk,t1_fm41eg0,1585846586.0,wow this response was beautiful and so true. i never realized how much i was ignoring and burying and how unhealthy that is. thank you for sharing this with me and everyone else who needed to see it :)
askwomenadvice,fm8bog0,t1_fm479w7,1585846448.0,that all makes sense to me! i’m glad i’m releasing pent up emotion like you said bc that’s a step closer to being healed. thanks for your response :)
askwomenadvice,fm8biq8,t1_fm3zwzf,1585846363.0,the day after the last time it happened i actually felt lighter so i guess there’s some healing happening.
askwomenadvice,fm8b20z,t1_fm403p9,1585846116.0,"thank you for sharing, it’s nice to know i’m not the only one who’s experienced this although i wish nobody ever has because it’s so hard."
askwomenadvice,fm8azkh,t1_fm3z9pw,1585846080.0,thank you so much for sharing your own experience with me. it hurts less knowing i’m not the only one who has felt this way! it’s hard to accept that i need to find closure within myself but i know i’ll be able to do it if i stay strong and give it time..
photocritique,fm3pc0n,t1_flfxgwy,1585731930.0,"thank you sooooo much for your response! it was so detailed and very helpful, i screenshot it all. you’re awesome. i can’t tell you’re very passionate about photography and i aspire to be as experienced as you one day. thanks to you i will be shooting even better than yesterday. i even love the ideas you gave at the end because i didn’t think of that but the little details really do make the biggest difference :)"
photocritique,fm3p90k,t1_flgscog,1585731837.0,thank you so much! :) i’ve been shooting on and off for 5 years but i never was dedicated enough to actually study how to become better until recently. how about you?
relationship_advice,flfx3c6,t3_foljua,1585121234.0,"that’s up to you and your partner to decide as a couple. it’s really an opinion- no one is wrong for what they feel about it. 
if a person absolutely needs porn in their life, and another person is absolutely against it, then that would mean neither would be willing to compromise and that could jeopardize the relationship."
photocritique,flfv1k4,t3_foln9c,1585118886.0,"i am very happy with the photo and hoping someone can tell me if it could possibly be more aesthetically pleasing. i was going for a simple good quality photo of a plant sprout despite the fact that the subject is in a dark room with light behind it.

legaladvice,fjzkery,t1_fjz45js,1583721814.0,"the owners of the store are money hungry even though they make good money selling beauty products, and i’m sure they won’t ban her unless she gets physical with someone unfortunately.
thanks for your response"
legaladvice,fjzkc7n,t1_fjz2keq,1583721764.0,"i honestly have no idea. she said she’s waiting for the lady to “do more” but other jobs i’ve worked at would have banned her on the first occasion. i guess i’m going to just have to deal with the crazy lady...it’s ridiculous.

*edit* they are very money hungry even though the store makes plenty of money and more! we sell hair & beauty products so everything we have is high demand and not cheap.
i’m starting to realize the safety of the employees means less than money."
depression,fjjy8ai,t1_fjjxlt2,1583415568.0,"the lol was the end of my sentence and i end all my messages with peace. don’t take your anger out on me because you take things the wrong way. & ive felt invisible on this board plenty of times i’m sure we all have, you’re no more special than anyone else. i definitely don’t pity you or anyone with depression as i hate when people pity me. 
(btw, depression isn’t an excuse to be an asshole)"
depression,fjjt378,t3_fduf9w,1583411294.0,"i’m sorry you don’t always get responses. there is most likely a lot of people who read your posts and relate and feel less alone, they just might not have the energy to think of or type a response. (i’ve been one of these people many times) 
one thing that helped me during my darkest days was watching ellen. it may sound cheesy but i swear the positive energy that show gives off saved me some days lol.  
peace ✌️"

spirituality,f5ps627,t1_f5obxif,1572366570.0,"Yes!! :) That’s why I admire him so much. 
 And yeah you are right about that second statement, it happens often."
spirituality,f5ob2o2,t1_f5oa80b,1572313886.0,"Hmm that’s interesting. Have you ever heard of Russell Brand by chance? I was excited when I realized not only could I listen to his words of wisdom on his Netflix documentary, and Youtube, but he spreads his knowledge & love on Instagram as well!! I’ve learned so much from beautiful souls like him & found new motivation just by being able to connect with them daily these ways. If you ever decide to try it out I recommend finding him.
Peace :)"

spirituality,f5o8fv5,t1_f5nxnfh,1572312255.0,that’s funny haha!! peace to you :)
spirituality,f5o8d1x,t1_f5nzrls,1572312206.0,"that’s not true. yes, some spiritual folks don’t like using social media, and some do. neither one is more or less spiritual than the other. usually, people with your beliefs are people that are stuck in this “fake spiritual” type of mentality where you think you have to do certain things to fit in, & can’t do certain things or your “spiritual card” gets taken away from you....there’s nothing wrong with spreading positivity & love within the social community, and it’s no different than doing it in real life as well. my photography & my captions are a way to express myself & what i love in an artistic way and connect with people who share the same interests as me. 
i’ve learned a lot from my spiritual friends on instagram and reddit & i will continue to be active in these communities :) 
may peace be with you!~"
depression,ewosvzm,t1_ewn24jw,1565625915.0,yes i do! i’m not sure if it’s just social anxiety or more general because i’ve never seen a professional about it before.
depression,ewmjuk9,t1_ewmj9qg,1565553399.0,"exactlyyy. i’m literally sitting in a corner at my family’s house right now feeling so out of place, i’m so tired of feeling this way! i’m glad someone understands."

relationship_advice,ew86jhu,t3_cn9qdv,1565204296.0,"i think if you have the chance to sit down and tell her how you feel with or without him you’ll feel a lot better. putting myself in your shoes, i completely understand why you feel the way you and don’t let anyone say you’re wrong for feeling that way. any human being would. if i was in that situation a sit down to where i could confront her with him by my side would be the only thing that put me at ease. good luck!"

relationship_advice,evetjxv,t1_evbxkwe,1564478457.0,wow you sound real mature... at the end of the day everyone has their preferences and that’s what makes or breaks a relationship. a person that needs a lot of communication will never be happy in a relationship with someone who would rather have less communication and more time for their life outside of the relationship unless both parties find a happy medium. calling him possessive for his personal preferences and openly expressing his genuine feelings is just ridiculous. talk to me when you actually have a good argument.
relationship_advice,evbuppo,t1_evbukm2,1564395436.0,how is he being possessive for just wanting to talk with his SO before he can’t for the rest of the day? you sound like you’ve never been in a relationship with someone you love before.
relationship_advice,evbuoc3,t3_cj99wj,1564395381.0,"if you had to go the rest of the entire day without talking to her you definitely have the right to at least feel upset about it. not saying she’s completely in the wrong but, when i know i’m working a double and won’t be able to talk to my SO for 12+ hours i take any chance i can to talk to them as much as possible even if i’m busy doing something else. everyone is different though. just express to her how you feel, you’re never wrong for having the feelings you do unless it’s coming from the wrong places. you sound like you just love your SO and wished she would pay you the least bit of attention before she disappears working the rest of the day and thats 100% understandable"
depression,evbm9y2,t3_cj7hoi,1564383338.0,is there someone close you can talk to for support? if you’re dealing with abuse you need to seek help asap.

depression,evbhdzu,t3_cj6r56,1564377472.0,hold on & just call your closest friend right now and tell them how you feel. if you don’t have a friend direct message me and tell me why you want to do this and what’s going through your head.
relationship_advice,evbh7ao,t3_cj68gv,1564377267.0,he sounds like a shit friend. if i were you i would call him a shithead and cut him out of my life for good.

relationship_advice,evbfzi2,t3_cj6hnp,1564375981.0,talk to her about it. if she’s not willing to throw away the things to make you feel better theres a good chance she hasn’t fully let go of the past with her ex yet and isn’t ready to.
depression,ev2wgtp,t3_ci951k,1564184924.0,"i can relate completely, only difference is i feel so numb & empty i don’t cry much at all and i just quit my job without a two weeks notice a few weeks ago with no follow up plan. just thought i’d share you’re not alone if it can make you feel better but sorry i don’t have any real good advice."

relationship_advice,euujmrw,t1_euuj7s3,1564045570.0,"why not? i’m interested in your deeper opinion. do you not think that’s controlling and toxic? when relationships are supposed

relationship_advice,eqjsc2o,t1_eqjpbf7,1560110438.0,No i’m not. I’m still trying to learn how to express myself in that way.
