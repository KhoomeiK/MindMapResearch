The same way if you didn't like something in the general area she has to accommodate you. I've lived with enough roomates  my whole life to know you dont use common areas for your own storage and unmentionables.  The boyfriend is a douche and so is your roommate though. Why not use your room?

FFVIIRemake,fqpu0h7,t1_fqna1x8,1589553956.0,Only way it would have some sort of resonance is if she sees the future  and decides to save Aerith because she believes cloud loves her more . So she does it for cloud Which would be tragic and selfless. To be in love but give it up ( and your life) because you love someone that much. Can make fans switch teams lol. But I'm just entertaining the idea. Still not ideal
FFVIIRemake,fqpti5h,t1_fqnjpk7,1589553690.0,Her death is the soul of the game. I believe the original was some sort of representation of death and grief that the creator or director had faced with his mother or something. To remove this would remove the original intent of the of game.

FFVIIRemake,fqnk8r6,t3_gjod8k,1589496352.0,I like your structured blueprint. It would push the story forward nicely and I would be ok waiting for the rest.

Currently I'm playing the entire xenosaga series again . But once I'm done I'll try the trails series since I never played them. I feel the farther back you go the better it takes your mind off FF7 remake. you'll find some of the older dogs had better full rpg mechanics. such as weakness and buffs and debuffs actually meaning something. Some have suggested the OG again and that's fine too. Good luck!

I havent been this excited about rpgs in a while.  Currently im playing Tokyo Mirage sessions which is pretty good and is basically persona lite. Once that is done probably the entire xenosaga series ( Havent played that since the last one came out during the ps2 days. Then Crisis Core Again and OG FFVII in between all of them. Final Fantasy 6 ( i never played it) will finally be played and finished this year I hope! Oh also Final Fantasy Tactics war of the lions. It has Cloud in it! OH and Fire Emblem Three houses. There are so many available to you!

I imagine the life we could have had . But reality sets in. She wants to get back together and texts me all the time about it. The reality part?  She lives 3 minutes away but has yet to come visit me. Why? Because the moment she gets back from work she drinks and all offers are now void. Imagine that. almost 6 months and she won't even come see me even though she wants to get back together. 7 years together up in flames. Alcohol is a terrible thing. You should try to move on. I am trying as well.
