mentalhealth,fok5zhj,t1_fok3rj1,1587836024.0,"Yeah agreed it's not black and white. 

So before I continue I want to share that a lot of these changes I made and different 'aha' moment came over time. Like I heard or read them but they didn't click until a few weeks after. This journey is like a dimmer switch, slowly but surely it'll get brighter and brighter. 

You are the average of the 5 people you are around the most. Change who you hang around with and you will start to change. Be around people with goals and aspirations, people that listen and also push you. I found 2 said groups: Lewis Mocker Mastermind and my current mentor and group Personal Freedom Mentoring with Jeremy Montoya. 
Figure out what YOU need to start your days off on the right foot and make those things non-negotiables. For me? When I wake up I take my dog out then do YBM - Yoga - Breathwork - Meditation + visualization exercise. I am ready to slay a dragon when I'm done lol on a more extreme case I quit my comfy IT job and started my own coaching program to help people through this process of reprogramming and rediscovering themselves. So I've got good influential friends, purpose in the work I do that I truly care about and a routine that helps me stay on track. If I'm ever not feeling the best it's usually because I skipped out on part of my routine.
If you're really interested I'd love to chat with you on where you are at and brainstorm potential action plans with you. You down?"
mentalhealth,fok2w5m,t1_fok26qw,1587834387.0,I became the controller of my ebs and flows. Depression and anxiety are parts of the human experience it's not about eradicating emotions but becoming aware that they are our bodies warning signs and to stop the downward spirals from lasting months to just an hour or two. Knowing all I know now though makes the whole medication aspect seem really sketchy. It's just a pill that makes you feel a little better but does not solve the root cause problem. It's almost like the depression has been made into a business
mentalhealth,fok1h49,t1_foi4i2p,1587833610.0,"It all starts with your own awareness. You need to learn how to step back from your emotions and notice that the thoughts you have thousands of times a day are not yours. Now this may sound weird if you've never heard of this before but you are the witness to your thoughts and emotions. The mind is but a tool that you have no control over. 
You are not your mind - breakthrough #1. There's some fundamental knowledge you need to learn about consciousness, ego and trauma. What was once a mystery and what you believed was just the type of person you are now turns into a series of programed behaviors that you used as a kid to keep you safe but now only cause you pain.
My anxiety was because I had to keep an eye on my parents emotions to be on their best side possible. The depression was in part of accepting the insults I would hear as a kid like I truly deserved them. I internalized then and also disassociated to keep myself safe from that intense emotional reaction. That's why I had a hard time remembering because I'd space out lol. 
Understand your traumas and be kind to yourself. As a kid you had no instruction on how to make the best out of the situation but those habits that used to help don't help you anymore. It's time to replace them with habits that serve you now.
This step in the process took a few months because I carried a lot of resentment even 20 years later. 
The next thing you need to understand is that your body is the unconscious mind. This means that when you remember something negative your body can't tell the difference of that happening right now or something that happened years ago. The chronic thinking of negative thoughts is actually addictive and toxic for the body. I'm not going to get into all of the science here, DM me if you want a more detailed description but your body gets addicted to the chemicals your brain spits out when you remember negative memories it's takes the body out of equilibrium and puts it into survival mode. 
Where am I going with this? Move your body! Your tight muscles are actually holding trauma. I used to be an IT/gaming guy so you can guess my hips and hamstrings were hella tight. I have had stretching sessions were I spontaneously start crying because I released some energy we'll call it that was blocked in my body. 
To summarize you need to make changes to 3 aspects of your life, you need to start training your:
Mind - Body - Soul

Training these in a progressive way will absolutely transform your reality and start feeling like 0 -> Hero.

Anxiety,fm6qybv,t3_ftfg8n,1585800791.0,"Hey man! This seems to be quite a common issue right now but fret not I have some ideas that can hopefully help and make your relationship stronger! Assuming you both have webcams:

1. Learn/Do Yoga together. Anxiety is worry of the future and depression is thinking of negative past events the problem is that life only happens right now, not when you're thinking. Yoga although great for getting fit/flexible/mobile/yadayada is primarily about union of mind/body/soul. This will help your gf because while going through the different poses it'll force her to put all of her attention on her body and not the negative thoughts. There are many yoga programs that are paid or free but doing this together is a really nice bonding moment and also equips her with a grounding tool for when she starts to feel depressed/anxious.
2. Start the habit of meditation - Again, something that would be a positive thing to do together and apart for both of you. This is a daily workout you could say that will, over time, allow her to be more conscious about the thoughts she reacts to. When you meditate, at least mindfulness meditation, it is commonly explained focus on your breath and to visualize your thoughts as clouds against a bright blue sky. You are the sky. Notice the different thoughts/clouds as they pass by but only notice them, don't judge any of them because that's what the mind does. Just notice. It can be incredibly difficult at first, just like doing a workout after living on your couch for months, but like any muscle it will get stronger over time.

I have some amazing books that have taught me many different mental tools to help ground myself, discover who I am and what I want to do in life. If you're interested let me know and I would be happy to share. Also let me know if you have any more questions."
depression,fm6pqaa,t3_ftf4u4,1585799866.0,"Hey Theo, I think it's awesome that you're so open to learning and trying new things to help your mental state. When you're forced to slow down and change your routine it really causes you to figure out what to do with your attention. Depression can actually become somewhat of an addiction, think of it like a comfortable misery. Here are some ideas I've learned that have impacted me the most:

1. You are not your mind - What I mean is that the thoughts you have in your head do NOT define who you are. Sometimes you have good thoughts and other times bad it's how you ACT on those thoughts that define your life
2. Every memory you have is a saved emotion in your brain. That's right, your memories are stored as emotions (even if you didn't feel ""anything"" apathy that is still an emotion"") When you consciously or more likely unconsciously think of a past traumatic event your brain says, ""hey! I've got an emotional record of that!"" and you feel that same horrible feeling again. Your body doesn't know that it happened 5, 10, 20 years ago it still feels it as though as it were happening to you. If you do this long enough it can really etch in your brain it can make it chronic. 
3. Your key to overcoming this regardless of however bad it may seem: Awareness - Awareness will been the key for you to completely change your life and come out of this quarantine a new person. What do I mean? I'm kinda blowing this up right? Well, the problem (in my experience) you might be having is that you can't control your thoughts. You are either addicted, totally identified, or base your entire reality on the thoughts you have. You might even have all 3 but don't fret, it's totally solvable. Becoming aware of the thoughts that pop into your mind and NOT JUDGING them will give you the opportunity to choose how to act on them. Wherever you put your focus you're putting your energy so if you notice you're having a negative thought spiral put your focus elsewhere. This gets exponentially harder the later it takes you to notice the downward spiral but always 100% doable. 
4. The trick: You need to learn, practice and master techniques that work for you to move your energy away from the negative thoughts and onto something else. Me? I have a few depending on the situation. If I'm at home and feeling down I immediately focus on my breath and the weight of my body on whatever I'm sitting/standing on. It takes a bit of practice, when I first started it took me quite a few min to get out of the funk but now I am able to do it in just a few breaths. I've also taken up activities that require my 100% attention like rock climbing, yoga and well meditation. Since I can't climb right now  :'( I've started working on my handstand. That's an exercise that is great for you physically but mentally as well. You need to be 100% focused on your entire body and breathing to hold the pose, that removes any bit of mental space any thought can get into.

depression,flzubyn,t3_fs77z4,1585633820.0,"Short answer?

You're addicted to thinking

Long answer?

There was a moment or, more probably series of moments that were traumatic to you growing up and you coped with the situation by going and thinking. By daydreaming away you were safe, you don't really feel like you're present in the situation making you uncomfortable. When you ""space out"" you're drifting, you are unconscious. 

Fix?

Increase awareness, be present. Life is flying before your eyes because you're unconscious coping mechanism is to space out and disassociate. If you don't want this then decide you want to be more present and work towards that!

Meditation, Yoga, Rock climbing, Chess...there a million activities you could work on that involve a lot of focus so you can train.

3. Thoughts and Emotions do NOT define who you are, they are warning signs based on what you've experienced in the past. 
4. Become aware when you start to feel that dread, the fear to put yourself out there to do something with your life.
5. Understand the feeling as a coping mechanism you used as a kid to keep you safe but it's not serving you now. That emotion isn't who you truly are but holding you back. 
6. You are greater than your emotions and thoughts, overcome this by making baby steps towards the direction you are wanting to head in. That seemingly small momentum will carry you to new experiences

""I started to compare myself to everyone around me "" - Why did you feel you needed to compare yourself to others? Weren't you feeling happy and dandy before? Was there a particular incident that caused to you feel self-conscious? 

""Then I started questioning my entire self, who I was and realized that I had no sturdy sense of self, and I didn't want that to be exposed by others"" - LOL I love is! Dude you are honestly so ahead of the game you don't realize it. 98% of humanity has no IDEA who they are or who their ""self"" is. This takes some serious conscious effort, buddhists and monks meditate on this their whole lives sometimes. 

&#x200B;

Throughout your life as a kid and now in college you have been ""conditioned"" or indoctrinated as I like to call it lol. Conditioning are behaviors that you have learned as a young kid that you repeat unconsciously as an adult (think habits). Conditioning is sometimes thought of as your personality but it's more adaptations to your environment. It's not who you truly are but who you believe you are. You going into seclusion was your coping mechanism, your way of keeping yourself safe. It's very likely something you did as a young kid after something traumatic happened. 

Obviously this isn't making you happy but more depressed but your young self didn't know how to deal with the situations that happened so now you're left with these unconscious habits. Awareness will be the key to your freedom and happiness. The fact that you are aware of how you are reacting and how you are feeling gives you the power to CHOOSE how to make your next step. Depression is a comfortable misery but it's not what we want here is it? Step out of your safety zone, what was it about interacting with people that made you excited/happy? What were you doing that made you laugh? Remember these times where the true you was shining!

 How can one find out the inner workings of their mind to heal? LEARNING

If you are truly desperate to stop suffering, to stop the seemingly endless cycles of depression (I had these waves of up and downs too) then take a look at the following books I am going to recommend that helped me. I suggest reading them in the order I list:

1. The Power of Now - Eckhart Tolle
2. Outwitting the Devil - Napoleon Hill
3. Extreme Ownership - Jocko Willink
4. How to win friends and influence people - Dale Carnegie

What you will learn in these books are the keys to begin a whole new life, a whole new reality where YOU are in control and you don't let depression drag you down. You don't let it drag you down because you'll learn how it works and tools on how to eradicate it.

I am about to provide you with advice that will be incredibly difficult for you, maybe the most difficult thing you've ever done but if you do this you will save yourself from so many years of depression/anxiety and general unhappiness.:

Love and forgive your parents. They are too unaware, they have a low level of consciousness that they literally don't know what they're doing. They are coping the same way they learned from their parents. They are stumbling in life just as you are and me and everyone else on this earth. They never learned how to express themselves, how to deal with stress, how to deal with negative thoughts. You clearly have a lot of love whether you like them or not and that is your strength. 

I HIGHLY recommend you start reading books by Napoleon Hill, Daniel Carnegie, Robert Kyosaki, Echkart Tolle, Chris Voss and others

Equip yourself with the tools to come out of this stronger and more conscious than your family. Don't continue this trend of trauma to your future kids (if you choose to have them).

I grew up being abused my whole life and when I moved out and had a job I was still plagued by the conditioning I learned growing up. Conditioning is learned behaviors from our earliest years that we unconsciously repeat all through adulthood. It's NOT who we are, it is who we BELIEVE we are.

You learned a series of core beliefs, coping mechanisms and habits that helped you survive your past traumas. If you want to heal it's time to get really familiar with the deepest parts of yourself and accept who you are, everything that you are up until now in your life. 

Only then can you begin your path to happiness.

Here's what stuck out to me from your whole message, "" It just completely invalidates what I have been through""

Having a different perspective/attitude doesn't mean: if you just got raped you pretend it didn't happen and go pick flowers to put in your hair, it means to fully accept what has happened and know that it is in the past. It's a part of your life experience and you have the god damn CHOICE on how you make your next step. 

Instead of seeing yourself as a victim, a different perspective offers you a window to a much different reality. A reality that doesn't include re-traumatizing yourself thinking you deserve negativity, that you deserve a shit life or anything. It offers freedom, choice, options.

First I'm going to share how I relate and then how I overcame some of the problems you're having. A lot of this is turning your attention to you instead of everything you don't ""have.""

&#x200B;

I'm 29 and grew up with very strict catholic parents who were driven by the notion that school = happiness/security. Them wanting to control how my life played out made me very isolated, I would feel the anguish of not knowing the feeling of making plans with friends. I didn't have my first gf till I was 21 and not because I'm not attractive but I was just unhappy and a mentally healthy person isn't going to want to date someone who brings them down. I created ""hats"" that I would wear depending on the social situation. I was never my true self. 

Fast forward to the present and I have completely overcome depression and have a full grip on anxiety but only because I chose to go down the journey to figure out who the fuck I am.

If you want to change your life you need 2 things:

1. A strong desire to change, to stop suffering, to stop feeling lazy and useless all the time.
2. A plan/direction

If you have that desire then now you need a plan. The following are changes I made that helped me climb out of depression. Understand that there is no on and off switch it takes time but it's a beautiful journey. Also understand that friends, a gf/bf, any of what you mentioned above will not make you happy or fix you. Happiness comes from within, think of all the super successful entrepreneurs that destroy their lives because they are unhappy and unfulfilled? You can bet they had tons of friends and bitches lol.

1. Quit my job to do something that actually fulfilled me
2. Instead of gaming 4-6 hours a day I picked up rock climbing
3. Decided I would try eating vegetarian for 30 days (still going)
4. Swapped Netflix/Hulu/Youtube to reading - more specifically audiobooks (fell in love with reading again)
5. Stopped watching porn
6. Learned that I am not my thoughts
7. Surrounded myself with higher quality people who inspired and motivated me (you are the average of the 5 people you spend your time with)
8. Surrendered to life
9. Zero expectations - dont' have them about people) 
10. Took responsibility for all aspects in my life (really important step)

depression,fllfnrt,t3_fpjx3e,1585259430.0,"I have no medical degree but I did overcome crippling depression and anxiety without antidepressants. 

I view antidepressants as a band-aid fix for a spewing jugular. There are deeper core issues that you need to work toward and this drug wont fix them period. That's what therapy is for but finding someone who you work well with as hard as you have experienced.

&#x200B;

My personal solution:

1. Understand that YOU ARE NOT YOUR THOUGHTS and your body is addicted to misery because it's safe and predictable. 
2. You can't begin to heal and feel better until you decide to stop suffering. It's a choice you're going to have to face and it needs to be a decision that is fueled with elevated emotions (love, gratitude, etc...)
3. You know how there's a specific tool for a job? There are mental tools you can use to keep you on track with your purpose. 
4. Awareness is your key to happiness

depression,fllesau,t3_fpjrqv,1585258956.0,"Hey! 2.5 years ago I was in the exact same situation you are in minus the psychiatrist. I lost interest in LITERALLY everything I enjoyed. My depression was so heavy that colors started to look grey to me. 

It's impossible for me to explain everything here in a comment but here are the main points that helped me to one, break free from depression/anxiety and two feel enjoyment and feel excited about life again.

&#x200B;

1. YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND Your thoughts don't define who you are. You like everyone else on earth was never trained on how to navigate the tool that is your mind. An uncontrolled tool can become really dangerous: depression, anxiety, guilt, suffering. 
2. You have an innate desire in this world that has been lost due to social, cultural, educational and religious conditioning. You need to understand that you are a makeup of so much conditioning that you need to peel the layers back to find out what your true purpose on earth is. A little background, my whole career 10+ years has been in IT because it was interesting to me and I was naturally good at it. The last 3 years were the most depressing and soul crushing because I was doing work that wasn't aligned with my purpose.
3. Depression is a comfortable state of misery. It's comfortable because you're on an autopilot routine that starts when you wake up and continues throughout the day. You expect to feel certain ways and expect interactions with certain people that you become your own self-fulfilling prophecy. Nothing will change until you make the CHOICE to stop suffering. This choice needs to come down from the bottom of your heart. 
4. The only time you can make a difference in your life is right now in the present moment, You need to become aware enough so that you can tell when you're thinking the depressive thoughts and cut that off before you get too deep. Awareness is your key to happiness. At first it's frustratingly difficult to not focus on thoughts because you've never practiced before but there are certain activities you can choose to do that help force you into the present moment and open up opportunities for you: Meditation (low key superpower), Yoga (get out of your head and into your body), I personally got into rock climbing although that'll be hard now lol, Meditation and Yoga are both something you can do at home and there are fantastic resources online to help you get started [Alomoves.com](https://Alomoves.com) for yoga and countless Meditation apps (headspace, breath, etc)

&#x200B;

I'm commenting on here to let you know that you aren't alone, people have felt what you are feeling and have been able to overcome it even when it ""feels"" impossible. You have the power to create the life you want, all it takes is a choice.

&#x200B;

1. Physically and emotionally get away from all of these people
2. Look to find a virtual psychologist to help work through the traumas that have occurred
3. Be patient with yourself and the healing process
4. Rediscover that you're bad ass that lived through a horrible time but came out on top and leveraged that experience to become a strong woman.

Don't make emotionally charged decisions, take a breath, step away. You know you're hurt, take the next few steps to heal up and come out stronger than before.

Anxiety,fllc1ad,t3_fpe8bg,1585257465.0,"Why do you feel your anxiety needs to be justified by other people? 

Anxiety =  a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease, typically about an imminent event or something with an uncertain outcome. 

When you are worried you are thinking about a potential outcome in the future that hasn't happened or may never happen.

If that's the definition of anxiety have you considered not focusing on the future but something else like the present moment? 

For a lot of people I have spoken with this seems impossible but what if by conscious practice on your own part you could train to stop being so anxious? 

Life only occurs in 1 point in time NOW, not the predictable or unpredictable future and not the past. Right now.

If you're feeling anxious you aren't present and life is passing by you with you on autopilot. Get present, get out of your way and start to live life on your terms.

depression,fllabmr,t1_fljmbpa,1585256533.0,"Loving this discussion!

Super happy to hear that you're still in treatment and working on yourself. In my experience there are few little tweaks you can work on in your vocabulary and thoughts that really go a long way:

""...it's impossible for me..."" could be rephrased as ""I am still working on myself""

Even little thinks like what I mentioned above really have an impact on your overall mental health. 

&#x200B;

1. Becoming aware of my traumas and social conditioning was a huge step for me in my healing journey. I view depression as a huge multi-variable thing, it can manifest itself in many ways to everyone. There is one commonality though: Identification with your mind. I agree with you though as a kid all we had was influence from our environments we had no choice. Our younger selves coped with whatever the situations were as best we could (disassociation etc...). When you can understand that most people are fumbling through life with only the experiences they have learned and inherited from their past it's easier to empathize and forgive. 
2. "" if you are severely depressed and already feeling like shit, it's highly unlikely that you will be able to make such a drastic change in your world view and how you really feel about it..."" I agree, this shift in perspective takes focus and energy. When you choose to stop suffering and want to actually make your life better it's a good way to go. Attitude about what you do is everything. Read Lead the Field by Earl Nightengale - good shit in that book
3. I'm really excited about your response here! Ok so, I said you need to own and accept everything in your life and you responded with ""how many severely depressed people are able to do that? How do you do something like that?"" How does any human do anything? You decide with intention. It took me getting to my lowest point ever, dude I was literally seeing the colors of life fade to grey it was horrible. It was then when I chose to stop suffering and do something...anything! 

""""bettering your life situation"" is not possible until you feel better mentally. That kind of changes can take a lot of motivation and energy.""

&#x200B;

When you are so identified with the mind and your thoughts that you believe them to be who you are (not true) you live in reaction to your environment. You are reaction based and not goal based. You making it a point to make your living situation ""nicer"" (light incense, open the windows, play music you like, etc...) makes a change in your body. Your body and mind will begin to respond different to the new stimulus YOU created for yourself! You see it's so hardwired to live day by day thinking the same thoughts, feeling the same feelings predicting what will happen next that of course you feel trapped. 

Your mind and body is addicted to depression and the emotions your thoughts cause every single day. If you can begin to become aware of this and make a decision with an elevated emotion ( love, gratitude, inspiration, joy, excitement, awe, or wonder etc...) that's when you'll change your life."

1. Yoga - the problem is constant and incessant thoughts that seem impossible to control. The physical practice of yoga moves your body in certain ways that it requires 100% of your focus. When that happens you remove the unwanted attention of those thoughts and into the present moment. This helped me a shit ton

2. Meditation - the secret tool I wish every human in history would be taught. I climbed out of my depression and anxiety after 2.5 years of a lot of hard work, books and failing but if I started meditating I would have much sooner.
