They chose a man with a credible sexual allegation against him and dementia. Why are you mad a poor, working class and mostly brown people for not getting the candidate that represents what they need to live?

Bernie was a legitimate candidate and the party coalesced to stop him immediately before Super Tuesday. Bernie meant M4A, GND, student loan forgiveness, etc.. Actual policy and hope. Had he been given a fair shake by MSNBC or CNN and we weren't hit with a pandemic, the other half of the country could have voted in earnest. People are blinded by their hatred of Trump, delusional about how devoted his supporters are and angry at Bernie supporters because we know Biden will not win against an incumbent populist in November, why?

There are some *really rough* parts to the book but it will explain a lot of what is going on. How your body remembers the trauma and processes it even when you're not conscious of it. It is essential reading imho."
chicago,fijzicg,t1_fiiplyv,1582468850.0,Thank you so much.
chicago,fiigbj7,t3_f59l04,1582421193.0,"My brother is moving to Chicago. He's gonna be living in the Palmer Square area and working in the Austin neighborhood. He has a large dog too. Should he keep his car or would public transportation be enough? We're Texas people so any insider tips on prepping for the winters? And, this question is just for me, is Palmer Square a safe neighborhood? He's one of my baby brothers and I've never been to Chicago so not reference point here."
PoliticalHumor,fi72ljl,t1_fi6yl4f,1582212970.0,This is agree with completely. Adding her to the bill would pull over a lot of undecided Dem voters. The moderates made nervous by Bernie would happily stand in line if Warren was the VP. It would be cool for them to work together to get M4A passed as well. She's been playing like they're not getting along though and burning some bridges with Bernie which I find odd especially considering how poorly she has been polling.
TwoXChromosomes,fhzdmxh,t1_fhsmay5,1581996810.0,You know Blooms only running to stop Bernie too. He threatened to do the same thing in 2016. Wonder why he doesn't want Bernie as the nom?
TwoXChromosomes,fhzdkxe,t1_fhrnp1j,1581996771.0,"Oh no no. Be sure to follow this link. Serious. It is VERY different what Bloomberg is doing. He is buying  the nomination. Everyone should be very, very afraid for our democracy rn.

TwoXChromosomes,fhzdfx8,t1_fht0xae,1581996672.0,I dont know. He had a heart attack several years ago and I went to the google machine to look for details (searched Bloomberg heart attack) and the first page of results was ALL Bloomberg articles saying he's super healthy. W.T.F.
TwoXChromosomes,fhrn3yt,t1_fhrfgff,1581831155.0,His ad campaign is **flooding** the televisions of millions. Voter's don't think he has merit. They have no idea. He's just on the tv a whole lot all of the sudden. It's very scary what's happening.
TooAfraidToAsk,fhlvm4o,t1_fhl8hgr,1581705295.0,"Same. 

""My mom just got out of the hospital and my brother can not manage her care, I have to leave immediately to help her off the couch.""

""Better look for another job while you're gone!"" 

Assholes."
AskReddit,fhk1nn5,t3_f3i60f,1581663005.0,"""I'm getting a stiffy just thinking about it."" Absolutely terrifying."
AmItheAsshole,fhbi7kp,t3_f29q6m,1581442807.0,"INFO but ESH leaning. Did you calmly communicate to them that paying his way wouldn't be fair?

Also, is no one in this thread in their 30s and still struggling a lot financially? I mean, I'm a millennial and cost of living vs wages has been f'in me over for a long time here. I just barely make ends meet. How are you paying for your school? Maybe I'm just way out of touch but if you can set money aside as a student working part-time, you must be getting some kind of financial help.

Yes, your brother needs to take ownership over his own life. I hope he's saving up money somehow considering he's not paying rent. 

Yes, your parents should cover your expenses for the trip too if it's now going to be a family affair and they invited themselves along to start. 

But is this some huge slap in the face of favouritism, I don't think so. I think they just didn't even consider it. Where the rest of your financial support comes from though would he pertinent information."
JustNoSO,fh8bdc9,t1_fh6xlx3,1581356122.0,Thank you. This is a lovely suggestion. Thank you.
JustNoSO,fh8bbxk,t1_fh76uk3,1581356098.0,"I haven't heard anything from them since they came and collected his stuff. That's been about 4 months now. I made it abundantly clear, when they came, they weren't going to come back for anything. That they needed to get all of it."
JustNoSO,fh8b6k6,t1_fh78xe8,1581356006.0,I honestly want to take them to small claims. I'm still reeling that anyone would do this to another person especially considering I spent almost the entirety of the relationship financially supporting this man completely.
JustNoSO,fh8b10j,t1_fh7ecw2,1581355912.0,"They don't care about the painting. Its painted on a huge pallet wall so heavy and not easy to move. It's been living suspended in my backyard. They (my ex and his dad) came and cleared all of his things out end of Sept, if I remember correctly. So, what was left was left for me to do with as I please. They haven't communicated since but that's also likely due to the group text I send my ex's family members to get them to make sure he stayed tf away from me."
