He pays 100% of their healthcare(yes 100% although he said he’s going to pay to start having employees pay in because of insane rising costs) plus puts in 5% into their 401k regardless of what they put in so they make even more with benefits.

Of course like all addiction that feeling is strongest when you first start which is what keeps you going but then you start chasing it so you continue plus now you have to clear your schedule for a whole week if you want to stop. It becomes an obsession that is impossible to shake from your brain. In a sick way it’s comforting because heroin because your purpose. As long as you get the dope then everything is okay. It helped get me through the work day looking forward to it after work. As far as how movies and shows depict it they definitely depict high doses. When you shoot up a good size dose you will get the dreamy, warm feeling that can be physical intoxicating.
