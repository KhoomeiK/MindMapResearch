Christianity,fqvsnhy,t3_gl7lbn,1589684276.0,"For me it‚Äôs not so much about believing. It‚Äôs the recognition that ancient texts are the only primary source we have on the history of humanity. The stories, songs, and philisophical ruminations contained within them are the best tools we have to understand, in a transcendental way, what our lives actually mean in the grand scheme of things. I just trust that there is wisdom to be had in reading them and taking them into serious consideration. My focus is on the Bible because that‚Äôs my ethnic heritage. It makes me feel like a complete human being, rather than an animal.

Archeologists, anthropologists, etc, are just speculators. I believed in evolution and all that hook line and sinker until I saw the bones with my own eyes. They have nothing. In the West they say human beings emerged in the middle east, in China they say we came from the far east. It‚Äôs a confidence game. They call it science, but it isn‚Äôt. The only thing I‚Äôve become convinced of by studying it is that human history probably goes back twice as long as they say it does which coincides directly with my interpretation of Genisis.

I‚Äôve studied archeology and anthropology at the university level. I‚Äôve written and read many academic papers on the deep past. It‚Äôs all bullshit. You have ancient scriptures and you have blowhard narcissists who speculate about the origins of things. It‚Äôs not a choice between a 2000 year old book and logic. For me at least, it‚Äôs a choice to either listen to voices of the past and try to derive some meaning from from them, or it is to view myself as nothing but an animal frantically trying to reproduce before I die. I choose to turn my back to the Abyss."

1) Running - it improves my mental functioning dramatically. Lifting weights helps as well, but not as much.

2) Medication - this should be number 1. See a psychiatrist for depression if you feel hopeless. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre for. I take medication every day.

3) Being Good at Something - I felt suicidal from the ages of 19 and 24 because of my autism. But then I started seriously working on my career. I got good at something that I chose myself and made a career out of it.

Corroboration - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r8uhcRK1QKU

4) Manning Up and Taking Responsibility for Myself - I‚Äôm going to be brutally honest about something. He shouldn‚Äôt be talking about his sex life with you, autism or no autism. He needs to be just actively solving problems on his own. Anything from taking a class, to joining a club, to seeking out social skills training, if he wants to improve he has to work at it.

5) Having Perspective - Plenty of people struggle with isolation and lonliness for different reasons. Look at all the comments. This is a common and manageable problem. It‚Äôs not the end of the world. He can overcome his internal and external challenges. He is stronger than he realizes.

TLDR: Depression can be managed, and he can improve. It‚Äôs not the end of the world."
