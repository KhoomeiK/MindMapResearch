rap,fhwtkij,t1_fhumii2,1581929533.0,"I fully understand where you're coming from (Message wasn't aimed at you btw) but there is also the slight difference we need to consider. Eminem is different in the aspect of life. He was a white male from a trailer park when he blew up and he was rhyming about white trailer park shit. In places where Kendrick raps of his childhood in songs like Swimming Pools, for example, Eminem went through it differently, which he shows with songs like brain damage. And although Em' ,in not only that song but in many others, takes a vile turn and wildly exaggerates the content of his song to give it comedic effect which Kendrick doesn't do. This simply turns more to the case of which style you like better which for me usually my mood decides, but it doesn't change the fact that despite the exaggerations, the song still tells part of Em's life.

Now speaking of Eminem's recent work, MTBMB, Stepdad is a song which is a great example of this. He speaks about how his stepdad abused him and his mom, which was also in the song Insane but was later dismissed by the artist himself as almost being fully fictionalised, and shows the devilish twists with the comedic wordplay in lines where he states he wants to kill him or just take vengeance. Despite being twisted we can still view it as telling a story.

Overall My take on rap music is that it doesn't have to have a deeper meaning. You look at Snoop who's a great story teller but is by far more funky and comedic than Kendrick and his raps don't have much extra meaning to them. Rap is the art of molding words to express yourself. There is really no boundaries to say what's good and what isn't, it's all almost 100% subjective (Almost 100% coz if you say someone like Lil Pump or Ice JJ Fish are the best lyricists then you're brain dead). A rap song does not needed a higher meaning to be good, but it's something that's much appreciated in the rap community and that's understandable, but in my eyes for example there just simply isn't a better Rapper than Eminem. And you can't say Eminem ain't good at passing a message coz even if you look at The Storm freestyle off BET then that's a message and a half even though it's only political."

2. If someone tells you to not choose a subject or says a subject is hard or don't go for it for HL, then LISTEN! ONLY choose that subject if you are prepared to put the work in.

3. Try to get ideas for all your IAs and maybe start some during summer break from y1 to y2. It will really help ease off a lot of stress truss.

4. Try to do most of your CAS in the first year, the schedule is waaay tighter in y2.
