He ignored me and freaked the fuck out of I ever hung out with another guy, and kept telling everyone that we were dating, so I dropped him as a friend. In response he accused me of giving him an std, accused me of sleeping with everyone in town, referring to me as a ""used up water bottle who will never find someone that will give a shit"", he also owed me money and refused to pay it back unless I returned his calls, (not worth it) showed up to my work and home uninvited, harassed me and even my grandmother because I refused to see our talk to him. I ended up moving almost 2000 miles across the country a month later and didn't tell anyone where I was going. I'm still in that state.

You could buy a hoodie that fits you and wear it for a days, or sleep with it and send it to her so she has your smell! 

Or find a place in her local town and buy her a spa treatment or a massage, or even a hair appointment. 

Or just find something that would benefit you both, like speakers to listen to or comfy pillows or a weighted blanket for when yall are FaceTiming, cause I know that shit can just be sad sometimes cause I'm sure you miss each other.

If you feel like your shampoo is making it oily I'd switch shampoos, get something from a professional salon. Or you could try not washing it all for a while and rinse with hot water. I know it sounds weird and gross but for alot of people, not washing at all helps with scalp issues. 

When you go to the salon, show them your scalp and they'll help you go from there, they might recommend a doctor /dermatologist, or help you pick out the right product.
