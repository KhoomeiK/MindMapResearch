ADHD,exdk7um,t3_crycw2,1566178892.0,"This was my experience. I cruised through high school with A's in nearly all my classes, despite putting in little/no effort. College hit me like a brick wall. I was in the pre-med track and had to take science courses that required hours of studying. I had no idea how to study properly, manage my time, etc. I was always distracted in lectures and would space out after 5-10min of taking notes. I felt so embarrassed having to ask classmates for notes time after time. During the first 2.5 years, I failed some classes and barely passed most of my science courses. Luckily, I visited a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with ADHD and started me on medication. Everything turned around dramatically, and I was finally able to do well enough in undergrad/grad school to be accepted into med school. I only wish I had started treatment and been diagnosed earlier."

I had a similar experience in college. I was pre-med and for the first 2.5 years was barely passing my courses. I felt like such a failure and fell into a pretty bad depression, which I saw a psychiatrist for. That psychiatrist was AMAZING, and not only did she start me on an antidepressant regimen, she also started probing me about my attention/concentration issues and began treating me for ADHD. My academic performance improved dramatically, and I‚Äôm now in my 4th year of med school and plan to become a psychiatrist.
