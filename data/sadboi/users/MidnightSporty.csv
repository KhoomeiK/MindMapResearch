GenderCritical,ff5002v,t3_erlmba,1579576586.0,"She‚Äôs right and it makes me sick. But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready to become a vegan. I don‚Äôt have time to do all the meal planning and food preparation to get a palatable dish. I also have a child who needs feeding therapy and I‚Äôd literally spend all my time in the kitchen. I‚Äôd then have zero time for my hobbies.

I don‚Äôt think veganism should become a feminist value. That will just sharply divide the community. Plus, we have no idea how women viewed the exploitation of female domesticated animals but it probably wasn‚Äôt with the derision you would believe as humans have been feeding human babies milk from other species for a long time AND it has saved the life of many a child.

Veganism=No more cow‚Äôs milk based baby formula=more undue pressure on women to breastfeed & more postpartum depression & most importantly, more dead babies, more dead children, vitamin D deficiencies, osteoporosis, etc. I bet early women thought domestication of animals was brilliant. It surely cut down time on foraging for food too....men didn‚Äôt have to do as much hunting.....they had more food security....

I think it‚Äôs wrong to say domestication and using animals as food and a source of resources is patriarchy. Women are also omnivorous. It‚Äôs not like women are herbivores. 

Veganism is not natural. It maybe be possible to live as a vegan nowadays since there is such an abundance of food but it‚Äôs in no way tied to the biology of women, it‚Äôs just lifestyle choice that takes a lot of hard work adding to the domestic duties women already have to do. Men becoming vegans=more food prep, food research for women...It encourages new mothers to give their babies and small children vegan diets resulting sometimes in death, nutritional deficiencies, failure to thrive. 

Expecting feminists to be vegans also puts unrealistic expectations onto feminists that aren‚Äôt placed on other groups. Domestication of animals can surely be likened to slavery and slaves are usually considered valid so is an anti-slavery advocate only valid if they are vegan? Was Spartacus a legit anti-slavery advocate or would he have needed to be vegan to have been legit.

I know this article doesn‚Äôt specifically say ‚Äúnot a real radical feminist if you aren‚Äôt vegan,‚Äù but that‚Äôs what‚Äôs implied.  It tries to lay heavy on the guilt. 

I have to wonder.....do female domesticated animals feel oppressed as a class by the male domesticated animals? That‚Äôs another thing to consider.

Often times with domesticated animals, the males are violent, willful and hard to handle so they‚Äôre killed young. Most veal comes from baby male cows so it‚Äôs not like males aren‚Äôt commodified either. 

Domestication of animals was also a great accomplishment in human history and I‚Äôm not about to give males all the  credit for it by claiming commodification of female domesticated animals is essential for matriarchy as I believe it would be an essential for matriarchy too."

GenderCritical,ff4wquz,t3_erm715,1579574291.0,"I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre asexual as you have felt sexual desire towards others. 

Pansexuality doesn‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs really the same as bisexuality. Gender critical doesn‚Äôt recognize gender identity as having a role in sexual orientation nor do we believe people choose their sexual partners based on gender identity, rather we define sexual orientation as based solely on attractions to one, more or both biological sexes. 

Bisexuality, well, only you can answer that question. 

But let‚Äôs say you are bisexual...is that going to change how you feel about men? 

Maybe you‚Äôre not the problem.

Men don‚Äôt see us as equals, they collude to deny us bodily autonomy, opportunities and wealth. A certain percentage of men physically harm us and rape us. Then there are men who don‚Äôt use physical violence but abuse us by insulting us, denying us say in the laws that govern our lives, they often berate us for not enjoying our subjugation, they force us to behave in certain ways and look certain ways or we suffer social and economic penalties. 

They deeply disrespect women for being able to create life while also being very envious of us. 

We also have little recourse when they harm us, and we rarely get justice. 

Over the past 15 years, men in the West have definitely become more sexist and misogynistic. Pornography, trafficking of women, prostitution, revenge porn, upskirt photos, etc., then a bunch of them come along, claim they‚Äôre women, throw a bunch of money at politicians and LGBT orgs, get the pharma guys in on it, and then they claim to be oppressed and start taking what our foremothers worked for?

I think it‚Äôs absolutely logical that you‚Äôve turned off men. The happiest women in society are women who have never been married. Women are happiest after their husbands die. 

Oh and don‚Äôt forget that some men, a vocal number of the trans-identified, literally want our uteruses implanted in their bodies so they can bear children and they believe getting a woman‚Äôs uterus is their human right. 

They also believe that have the right to own a woman as a domestic worker and sex toy. They also fetishize lesbians and bisexual women and expect us to sleep with them. 

I can‚Äôt possibly possibly fathom why men would put you off. Did one of them beat you in track or something at the state championships or something? Because they‚Äôre allowed to do that too you know. They have taken away women‚Äôs sports, women‚Äôs bathrooms, women‚Äôs clubs, women‚Äôs organizations.

Prior to transgender self-ID women could easily challenge men who went into women‚Äôs bathrooms. Now we can‚Äôt. Many sex offenders will flee if you fight back or challenge them. 

Getting caught in a woman‚Äôs bathroom usually wood result in criminal charges for a man for things such as voyeurism. 

As such, men would be deterred both by the possibility of arrest and also for the social cost of flouting social norms. Plus, other men would stop men from going into the ladies‚Äô room if they saw it happen. 

Now there are no grounds to stop a man from using a women‚Äôs toilet. 

Changing social norms about bathroom use means everyone, including the police, are going to be loathe to stop any man from using that ladies‚Äô room if he is wearing stereotypically female clothing it says can‚Äôt do that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a trans woman.‚Äù

Trans self-ID gives sex offenders a means to give themselves an aura of legitimacy when they want to engage in voyeurism, exhibitionism or masturbation in a women‚Äôs toilet. 

Essentially, trans self-ID has legalized make voyeurism and exhibitionism in female spaces. 

We know that TiMs would be afraid to engage in voyeurism and exhibitionism in women‚Äôs toilets otherwise, they have said so themselves. That‚Äôs why they want to legalize their presence. That‚Äôs why they want to make us afraid of challenging them. 

Rapists don‚Äôt necessarily start out as rapists either. Their behaviour escalates often starting with voyeurusm and exhibitionism. Legalizing those acts in women‚Äôs toilets means those behaviours will become old hat to TiMs fairly quickly, resulting in them escalating to more heinous and violent forms of sexual assault, including rape. 

Sexual offences are also often a crime of opportunity too. TiMs are now being given legal access to spaces where they will have more opportunities to assault women.

TRAs already claim that gender feminine women are trans men or non-binary. 



‚Äú[U]p to the mid-nineteenth century the predominant approach to female criminality was moralistic. Women criminals were judged against a highly artificial notion of the ideal woman ‚Äì an exemplary moral being. Women¬¥s crimes not only broke the criminal law but were viewed as acts of deviance from the ¬¥norm¬¥ of femininity.‚Äù

This double breach of norms has meant that the stigma associated with offending has been assumed to be greater for female offenders than for their male counterparts (Estrada & Nilsson, 2012; Lander, 2014). The second central theme, i.e. those women who engage in crime must be out of their minds (Mad/Sad), is usually linked to Lombroso and the emergence of the positivist school of criminology (see e.g. Smart, 1976). According to Zedner (1991, p. 315), however, Lombroso‚Äôs work merely reflected a broader contemporary ‚Äòshift from early moralistic understandings of crime to the rise of secular, scientific, and increasingly exculpatory interpretations and responses to female criminality‚Äô. This pathologization of the offender was not of course restricted to females, but perhaps its most extreme consequence was nonetheless seen in the sterilisation campaigns of the early 20th century. Since criminality was regarded as being caused by physical and or mental defects, it was quite logical to specifically prevent female offenders from reproducing.‚Äù [The female offender - A century of registered crime and daily press reporting on women‚Äôs crime](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2578983X.2019.1657269#)"

Neckbeards on Reddit may not, but I have yet to encounter a male working in the justice system, like a police officer or a defence lawyer who won‚Äôt acknowledge it although my lawyer claimed women get lighter sentences for the same crimes when I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs true.
