Maybe because it didn‚Äôt show the brutal nature that clone wars developed into during the later seasons or the emotional roller coaster many arcs presented. Imagine if echo actual went insane instead of being back to normal 5 minutes later. What if instead of admiral trench being a coward and giving the info immediately, anakin force choked him like he did to poggle and thrashed him a bit. Also echos loyalty be questioned went nowhere, even the ‚Äúrecoup our losses‚Äù line will probably won‚Äôt be touched on because this season is only 12 episodes.
