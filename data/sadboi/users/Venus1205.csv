Eu sou do Brasil."
depression,fk1rduo,t3_ffzbld,1583785337.0,"I relate. I’m supposed to turn 28 in may, but I’m thinking about how I’m going to kill myself before that. I’m almost sure I’ll hang myself. I think I’m going to buy some rope tomorrow and learn how to make the knot."
depression,fjzgikg,t3_fflir8,1583719184.0,Me too. I’d like to disappear completely.
depression,fjbljo5,t3_fcm5io,1583196019.0,Oh my God. I relate so bad.
depression,fimtmfk,t3_f8pyum,1582546500.0,I know how you feel. That’s why I prefer to be alone most of the time.
relationship_advice,fi714q0,t3_f6uhdg,1582212078.0,You should be glad your parents have an active sex life. Grow up.

depression,fhqxs8h,t3_f4iiwt,1581813271.0,"I had a similar thought today. As far as my memory goes, I can’t remember not being suicidal."
relationship_advice,fhkeqhb,t3_f3mb0f,1581680732.0,I actually got turned on by your self-description. I love me some weird guy.
Anxiety,fgngxcl,t3_ezigog,1580944640.0,"I don’t know if that makes sense, but I gave up “internally”. I put on my shoes in the morning and do everything I have to do on the autopilot. I’m not giving a piece of advice or anything, because I don’t that’s healthy, but anyway, it’s what I do. I don’t expect anything."
OCD,fgngd15,t3_ex90rq,1580944293.0,"Mine does. Have had some telogen effluvium episodes caused by stress, anxiety and depression. But like said before, it grows back normally."
depression,fgjlh4e,t3_eyv98p,1580846487.0,"I don’t wanna get better because I’m afraid of happiness. Everytime I was happy something would happen and make me even more miserable than I was before, kind of like a cycle. So, I’m comfortable where I am, thanks."
depression,fggtt6d,t3_eydyd0,1580769404.0,"Yes, I have headaches in consequence of the self hate and loathing."
depression,fggtbt0,t3_eyclc3,1580769094.0,I am. But the difference with me is that I wasn’t positive about this year at all.
depression,fggs3sf,t3_eydhsq,1580768320.0,Same here. I really prefer listening to someone say “I understand what you feel” or “I’m here if you need help” than those motivacional bullshit. It just feels so generic and phony.

depression,fgeniie,t3_enrs4c,1580704055.0,"Absolutely. In my case, that feeling comes mostly from a bunch of traumatic life experiences (father’s death, stepfather abuse, best friend suicide) when I tried to seek help from my friends and family but no one cared. So now, everytime I have a crisis and I think about talking to someone - some friend or family - I have to think twice, because in the end I know no one will care and I’ll just end up feeling ridiculous and melodramatic."
relationship_advice,eso5yp4,t1_eso4bu1,1562160523.0,"I guess I just can't stand being vulnerable in a relationship, and I would never do that to a significant other. So, when things like that happen to me, I just run."
relationship_advice,eso5pwy,t1_eso5bgd,1562160355.0,"I did told him, several times. I've been trying to be chill about their friendship, but when I saw she blocked me on her stories, I got mad."
