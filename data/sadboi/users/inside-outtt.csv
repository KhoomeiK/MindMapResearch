self,fo7f288,t3_ftktkr,1587577242.0,"When I was a little kid, there were usually lot of junk food and sweets in the house and I wasn't restricted in eating whatever I wanted. I remember very little about my childhood but I was always concerned about my body image. My mother told me that dieting is stupid and at the same time that I had to go to the gym to not be fatty and without abs (I WAS ABOUT TEN OR ELEVEN) and ""you're not fatty, you're just thick"" lmao. I started trying to lose weight at the age of 14, I dieted, I fasted, I went on binge eating and even if somebody noticed my strange behaviour they didn't say anything. 

I'm in recovery now and I've realised that my mum just projected her complexes on me, she isn't pleased with her body image too. If only I had known this earlier before my eating disorders were developing."
