1) I’m not sure if they were research papers or what it was, but I know I’ve seen it suggested in the last week or so that some people might have immunity to covid due to exposure to certain other coronaviruses 

2) Some of the antibody tests have been stated to be unreliable because they show false positives due to picking up on antibodies from common cold coronaviruses and not covid 

Is it possible that those tests aren’t actually showing a false positive, at least for antibodies? Like maybe those people really didn’t have covid, but maybe they had the certain coronaviruses that give certain people immunity as has been recently speculated?"
