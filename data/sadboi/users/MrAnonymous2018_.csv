I've certainly wondered if it was justified, but right now, eh. I don't wish awful things would happen per se, I wish that things that could kill me happened. It's interesting seeing it from your perspective.

I know I'm probably being obtuse but, er, I disagree with courage in ending one's life doesn't exist. The fear of realizing death might be possible is absolutely overwhelming. I suppose it might be the feeling people describe when they say they have a moment of regret after jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. Unfortunately this moment of thinking I'm near death had no such life revelation that I want to live like they did. I did get a dose of fear, though. 

Suicide can solve everything. If you are religious then one would be reasonably afraid of doing it, and it also depends on what your take on the afterlife is. I have no idea what's on the other side. I do know that without a functioning brain, there will be no emotions, no pain, no anything, in exchange for eternal nothingness. It seems so impossible sometimes because this is reality. How can one just, cease to exist into nothingness.

You're very kind in saying that I've been through enough, which would just make me thinking about what I said up there. It is an assured end to all this shit, versus the word of people saying it gets better. As for the last part, I understand what you're saying but I'm not sure where I'd begin, assuming that's true."

>It was only years and years later I corrected that by getting tested for BPD, which took ages as well. I'm not going to lie. The process sucked (for me anyway). But I'm so glad I did it.

In my book, 5/10 is average and you are not average, at least with how you appear in this photo. I would say 7/10 on my own scale, but according to this scale it means you can be a model at 7/10."

Don't spin yourself in circles creating some way they could have been cheating on you and then accuse them of it.

Don't worry about what's on their phone.

Regardless, it's my opinion that relationships are pain. They will all end the same. It won't be their fault."

At best I can get some audio recordings but he'll be rather unsupportive of my recording of him.


I do have a text conversation where he threatens to use police as a weapon but otherwise I probably won't get much more than some audio of him yelling. 

She was yelling ow after the incident this morning and she ran him out of the house. That's the best case scenario if I'm recording"

But it's irrelevant if they don't drug test. This means his threats about having my mom drug tested are also null then."

His original sentence was going to be 2 years but we wrote emails stating that we didn't want him to go to prison(mother's idea) and he got off light. 30 days in jail that he didn't have to serve because he was having heart troubles because of all the stress and *drugs*.

P.S- Am at work"
legaladviceofftopic,eyla6om,t1_eyl9avn,1567179785.0,"He is already a felon and he actually got himself another assault charge 6 months ago against the one and only. 

If they wouldn't drug test him, then I guess this means his claims that he's going to call the police and have my mom drug tested are also just another one of his bully tactics.

To be fair, she was a goddamn idiot and after years and years of not doing anything, she decides to smoke some pot with him 4 ish days ago. So that's why he threatens that."

How can people read the bible and still believe. It's ""gods word"". I am ignorant of all the things in it, but I suppose sexism is suddenly okay according to god.
