schizophrenia,flu697s,t3_fr6ovj,1585496133.0,"I see people all the time who aren't really there and it's a daily thing. Judging my vision alone, differentiating hallucinated individuals versus the not is not easily done. However, judging by vision AS WELL AS specific designating factors that I've defined for myself allow me to make that differentiation. That guy in the car that I can barely see probably because of his tinted windows and the way light is reflecting off of it is oddly translucent looking when in comparison, another guy with the same specifics as the first is OBVIOUSLY opaque in nature. You can't slightly see through a real fucking human bro. I've learned to live with things similar to this as i have begun to notice that when my hallucinations lessen in the number of occurences, I actually feel lonelier than usual. I find myself sad when all my people's are unusually quiet on particular days as they tend to be quite hilarious and make some of the most vulgar, innapropriate, and unbelievably DISRESPECTFUL jokes delivered the way that a stand up comedian would deliver his performance. Kind of like a Key and Peele episode or something especially bc for some reason I usually lean towards thinking in eubonics. 

I desperately wish I had the type speed to record my peoples as they occur. Each person is unique too. Usually similar to someone in my actual life. Lol i love my brain"

thewoodlands,fkp8imm,t1_fkoyzg8,1584404209.0,I build repair and refurbish bikes as another interesting hobby that I have. I’ve built countless bikes from scratch.
thewoodlands,fkoebsf,t1_fknxgi3,1584385507.0," Dudeeee the bikes part though. I literally just posted this in this same subreddit as well as another one.

Look at it. 
Also, where’s your neighborhood? Why are you only limited to solo looking in your neighborhood? Do you not have a vehicle? Neither do i. I use a bike to go. I really want a bike trailer. 

It sounds like you find good stuff in your neighborhood? I haven’t really checked out mine on trash days honestly. We should totally link up though since you’re close by and go on a treasure hunting adventure together"
thewoodlands,fkod6n6,t3_fjpyoo,1584384853.0,Or bikes!!! I am looking for all bike and bike parts that you are getting rid of or don’t want anymore!!! Bikes and bike parts I will try to pick up myself with my current bike. I am asking for FREE bikes or bike parts. Any condition accepted. Please don’t send me bikes that I have to buy. That defeats the whole purpose of what I’m trying to do.
thewoodlands,fkobmca,t1_fkny8ue,1584383961.0,What’s the local buy nothing project? I’m gonna look it up. I’m really wanting to get a car. Lol
thewoodlands,fkobk3g,t1_fkobfs1,1584383926.0,PM’d!

Let’s go together!!! I live near this corner store where the address is 24102 Kuykendahl rd tomball tx. If you are close to that address we should talk about linking up. To reiterate, that’s not my house. That’s the corner store near to my house"
thewoodlands,fknpojl,t1_fknmhx8,1584371269.0,"So far I’ve only gone to the plazas by my house and I found a brand new glassed topped patio table, a brand new fancy dining table, a new microwave, cell phones, cords, a lamp I use daily, and over 70 bottles of health nut drinks like aloe water and carbonated fruit water and some other variations. All still within date. Two brand new huge pet treat jars. And that was one trip. I normally go at night time but I’m open to going any time of the day honestly. I really not embarrassed about it I just really want someone like me who has fun doing it too to come with me. It’s so much funnier being with a friend"
thewoodlands,fknpdf7,t1_fknf4u7,1584371076.0,I’m very good at refurbishing and rescuing items that the common public render useless and reselling it as if there was never anything wrong to begin with it so far. I find dumpster diving great and fun and also profitable for just being a fun hobby.
thewoodlands,fknp77p,t1_fkndqbh,1584370965.0,This is my exact thinking for why I wanted to dumpster dive here. I do it for fun and just recently moved the the spring and woodlands area and really want a buddy to go with. And really need a bike trailer
thewoodlands,fknp4tx,t1_fkn6uir,1584370921.0,"Lmao I am a dumpster diver from Tampa! I ride my bike for it bc I don’t have a vehicle. I’m not embarrassed to do it because I know people here can be a little snarky, I just want a friend to go with due to the fact that I am a young pretty female out on the streets alone at really late hours. It’s more for safety... and fun! With a partner we could get so much shit for fun or profit"
thewoodlands,fknoyui,t1_fknnmjy,1584370809.0,What are the different trash day combos that variate usually? Like Monday and Wednesday? You don’t have to know a specific neighborhoods trash day I just don’t know what the weekly schedule of the trucks running lol I’m new here
thewoodlands,fknov1x,t1_fknh8fp,1584370742.0,I don’t have a car myself I ride my bike going treasure hunting and I’m in real need of a bike trailer because I always find really good stuff when I go.
