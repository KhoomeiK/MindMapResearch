Si desean moverse por la.ciudad usen cualquier aplicación de taxi. Como tendrán un nuevo número podrían aplicar a las ofertas de Uber por su primer viaje así se ahorran un poco xD. Usen mejor aplicación de taxis porque aveces hay taxistas que se dan cuenta que no son de aquí y les puedes cobrar más.
