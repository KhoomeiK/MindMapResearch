### The Conspiracy Behind Your Glasses

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAeHuDcy\_bY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAeHuDcy_bY) 

Recently visited a dentist to just put an adhesive under my loose crown and fix the looseness.what he did was he took out the crown with his hands,it was so loose that I could have picked it up myself.then applied the adhesive on the crown then put it back on.he charged me $300 for this and he wasted 2 hours of my time just to pretend that this matter is a hard job. I figured out the next time it gets loose i just apply the adhesive which is called temporary cement and put the crown back on myself. they sell the temporary cement in the pharmacy for $70."

askTO,eya21c6,t1_ey5n31e,1566956948.0,"> Why are you telling people you are gay when you are looking for an apartment?

I didn't go around telling people I'm gay.when I was looking for a place one landlord asked me if I was gay? and I responded no.since I could see that it's not their business.

> Canadians who have lived here for years will not be at these workshops. You were being judged by other newly arrived immigrants like you, not Canadians who lived here for years or grew up here.

This landlord told me that she was living in Canada for 20 years. it doesn't matter how many years you live in a country, if you are a bigot you will stay a judgmental homophobic bigot."
askTO,ey2sti9,t3_cv7gsp,1566747504.0,"I moved from Iran to Toronto last year.31 female. IT background as well.

These were the things that I've experienced:

1.I was alone and had a hard time finding an affordable place to rent.landlords misuse the fact that you are a newcomer and don't have a credit score so they want 6 months upfront which is illegeal.so it's better to find a room to rent in a house of a condo so you only pay first and last month.

2.I also had several years of experience in IT but finding a job like the one you had back home is not gonna happen. you have to start from the bottom.like a new college grad which really fucked me up emotionally. I felt like my experience didn't matter to the employer in Canada,simply because I didn't have Canadian experience.

3.Expect 7 months of cold weather.the winter sucks and I didn't like it. I suffer from Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and the past winter was a hell for me.

4.People will pretend that they accept LGBTQA people, but deep down most of them are homophobes. As a naive newcomer when I went to settlement workshops, people would ask me if I have a husband and kids and when I told them that I'm homosexual, their attitude would change to the point that girls would ignore me and wouldn't sit near me.

The other bad experience that I had was when I was looking for a place to rent, one of the landlords told me that they wouldn't rent to homosexuals and asked me if i was normal and I had to hide my homosexuality to be able to rent an affordable place.

These experiences made me think that all those pride month advetisements were bullshit and mostly it's pretend.  
Yes the law is with you but most of the people won't accept you,becasue they are also immigrants and come from homophobic cultures.

5.finding a family doctor can take a long time but if you find a good one,it's worth it.

overall this had been my experience.maybe you will experience the opposit of this.good luck."

SuicideWatch,exhyz43,t3_cstyk4,1566317415.0,"""it gets better"" is a crap that everyone will say to you, but as someone who wanted to commit suicide all my life, I had to say ""it gets worse"" and you have to accept it. life is pain and misery.we are born crying. pain is in our subconscious.

When I started reading  Arthur Schopenhauer books, everything changed for me.I realized that i was searching for happiness and happiness does not exist,because human being will never be happy. he/she will always be unhappy about something.Arthur *Schopenhauer* saidâ€” '*Life* swings like a *pendulum* backward and forward between pain and boredom.'A happy life is to avoid these two: 1.pain 2.boredom

How to avoid pain:learn a highly valued skill so you could earn more and then save and invest to become financially free.

How to avoid boredom:Start reading and learning about different things. find hobbies and passion projects for life."
