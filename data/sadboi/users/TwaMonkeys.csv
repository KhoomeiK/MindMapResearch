I have some sympathy for the 'we can do more about climate change if we are independent' argument - but ultimately it frustrates me. We don't have very much time and I see no evidence of serious thinking from the SNP on how a post independence Scotland can adapt itself to life without an oil industry and the employment it provides.

No - they cannot do anything yet - but the lack of thought and public discussion gives little cause of optimism that they have even *begun* to understand what will be a major issue for an independent Scotland.

I do vote for them *sometimes* \- but only ever tactically. They've done one or two good things, albeit tinkering around the edges., to the best of their ability, given the hamstring of devolved powers. But they always seem to me a party that is lacking an overall vision on anything beyond independence.

If we want an independent Scotland, then now would be the time to talk about what sort of Scotland we want. And they do do that - but in a bad way. By the noises coming out of the SNP (e.g. the Growth Commission), the answer seems to be neoliberalism. And don't even start me on their world-renowned climate targets, which inconveniently clash with their repeatedly stated policy of maximum extraction of oil reserves.

They're not all bad. I know a few sincere socialists in the SNP - but that doesn't make them a socialist party by any means. And the fact that they harbour and enable high-profile transphobes doesn't necessarily make them transphobic, They're a broad church party - but that means they can only *ever* be a broad church party.
