I moved here from Iowa in 2010 partially to get a change in life from small town life.  I grew up in a rural setting where you knew your neighbor, and everyone was generally nice to eachother.  Yea, drunks & drug addicts were there, but overall, life in Iowa was pretty care-free and happy.

Admittedly, I moved here under bad plans, mostly to move in with my then-bf who I had already known 5-6 years prior, and been in an LDR for about a year.  That crashed and burned within 3 weeks of the move.

Here, I've felt nothing but negativity, and a huge ""Me first!"" attitude from almost everyone I've met.  Very few people who were truly honest with me.  I'm looking into leaving any direction I can just to start over, as I went from being happy & optimistic on life, to just trying to make it to the next day without being burned by someone else for their own gain.

Also, before the move, I did try looking for work on craigslist and other options at the time, and almost every suburb or section of central-western PA calls themselves Pittsburgh.  So I thought access to jobs were plentiful.  Now here I am living in Aspinwall, and applying for jobs I find out are in Penn hills, tarentum, south hills, wilmerding, ect.
