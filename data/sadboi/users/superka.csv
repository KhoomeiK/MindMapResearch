relationship_advice,fm973ct,t3_ftk5hc,1585862960.0,"I'm a similar situation as you. I allow her to have other guy friends (I don't want to control anyone) but I made my boundaries clear by telling her she's giving another guy way to much attention and neglecting me. Told her she's way to fixated on the other guy. She said she only wants me  BUT I did more on my end to show that I'm better. What I've done is I flirt more often with her, bought her a cute necklace, make jokes, buy her dinner, give her some of her favorite things, and tried to do things to make her feel wanted.

Basically what I'm saying is, try to make her feel wanted without going overboard and clingy. And if she's really fixated on this guy, maybe ask her if she's happy with the relationship cuz clearly, her mind is elsewhere and you may have to accept the end result. I wish you the best!

EDIT: Basically redid everything I just said."
