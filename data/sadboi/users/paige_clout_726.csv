Back when I was in the 4th grade, we had a student from Saudi Arabia come to our class for a few months. It was actually really cool to know her. I was her best friend during the time she was there and she would spend every second she could with me. However, she was really, really sensitive. She would throw tantrums if anyone slightly upset her in any way. It was ridiculous. The teachers and staff would give her presents and snacks if she went an hour without screaming like a two year old. I was constantly expected to calm her down when she was upset, since I was the only one who could do so. One day, me, one of my friends, and her were joking around. She wasn't upset, she actually seemed really happy. I made a shush motion with my hand (like to tell someone to shut their mouth) as an inside joke I'm too lazy to explain. She laughed; we had been doing it all day and she thought it was hilarious. But that one time, there was a staff member near us and she immediately came over to us yelling, ""You cannot do that to our foreign student! I am alerting your AP right this instant! You will both be getting detentions! (Referring to my friend and I)""

My friend and I then had to talk to our AP (a terrifying woman that everyone hated), giving our explanations as to why we would do such a terrible thing. We then had to apologize to her in front of the principal, and it was really satisfying to know she was watching when the student replied, ""Haha it's ok! What are you sorry for?"" 

Ridiculous."

unpopularopinion,foqlyf8,t1_foqi3pg,1587996437.0,"I still get the sense that you’re joking but ok fine here’s the timeline if you’re interested (warning, it’s very long.) : My dad was abused as a kid so he became a sociopath as he got older. He and all of his siblings are so intelligent that they qualify for Mensa. That mixed with sociopathy is not a good thing. When he was in high school, he met my mom. He noticed my mom was a really shy girl who wouldn’t really ever stand up for herself. Sounds like the kind of wife you would want if you want to abuse her and use her. My mom doesn’t really say no to anything, so my dad was able to get her to go on dates with him until she fell for him.. I think. I’m still not sure. Anyways they get married and have my brother. My brother has some vivid memories of my dad verbally abusing him when he was little; he was too smart to ever hit us. That would make him seem like a bad person. Then a few years later he had his daughter, me. I was always scared and creeped out by my dad and looking back I don’t think I ever actually loved him. He had an unnerving presence. While most dads aren’t very talkative are kind of quirky and annoying and just mow the lawn all day, my dad wasnt a normal dad. He would act overly enthusiastic to see his family members. He sometimes talked in a very high pitched voice, like he was talking to a toddler, while if he ever got mad, he would yell at the top of his lungs and could get absolutely terrifying very very quickly. He was either completely absent or interrogating me on what I’m up to. He was a very dominant speaker and my mother was rarely able to get a word in when he was in the room. If anyone was ever emotional in any sort of way, he would find a way to make you feel bad about it. I had severe anger issues when I was a little girl. It was not acceptable in my household to be angry at all, so I would let any anger just build up inside of me until I couldn’t take it anymore. I would have emotional outbursts, my father would make me feel like crap for it and the cycle continues. Unfortunately, it just made my brother very emotionally numb. He simply went along with anything my dad did and never questioned anything. It was easier than the path I took. Here’s where things get interesting: My dad was a girl’s soccer coach at a high school. I became friends with one of the girls on the team. My dad loved to be around her, he often treated her more nicely than me or my mother. Then one day she moved to our town. What he would do was come up to me at least once a week, say we should go to her house to have a fun movie night, put me on the spot so I would say yes, go up to my mom and say “hey, she wants to go to my student’s house! That’s weird, bye!” I still sometimes have mental breakdowns if anything happens to remind me of the visits to that girl’s house. Most of the time I spent was listening to songs that reminded me of home while trying to look away from my dad snuggling with my friend, a teenager. I swore I saw them make out a few times but obviously being the little girl I was I told myself that it was probably nothing and my dear old dad would never do that. If I ever gave them a weird look they would smile at me in this really creepy way I can’t even describe, they didn’t even ask what I was looking at. Well one day he comes home without a job and some bad news. He was obviously cheating with her. I’m still angry with myself for never realizing it sooner (But again, I was a dumb little girl who was brainwashed to view my dad as a saint). We catch him again and again with her, and so do the police. He gets arrested of course. My sweet mom tries her best to put her marriage back together for years until one day she just had to divorce him, so she did. All seemed to be well after that, my dad apologized once more and he saw me once a week (super involved dad, right?). Until one day my best friend sees him making out with a teenager at Walmart. That was the last straw, I made the connection that he was a high functioning sociopath and cut him off without saying another word to him. I was 13. I didn’t feel any remorse or regret or anything like that. It was very freeing. I did come across him one day and while he pretended to cry, I simply stared him down and walked away. Best feeling ever. I haven’t talked to him in years. Some other things happened in my life that made me feel really lost and empty. I cried myself to sleep every single night and suicide was on my mind for a very long time. I had no idea who I was, that is until I found my faith again. I won’t lecture you but I’ll just say I don’t know where I would be without my faith. It gives me a sense of peace and love I don’t get anywhere else. It’s helped me heal after all the things my dad has put me through. I don’t suspect you’re still reading but if you are, thank you. Anyways that’s my life story I hope you enjoyed"

unpopularopinion,fomipr7,t1_fojh0iy,1587891503.0,"Me too. My mom agrees with me and knows how much he abused me and the things he put me through. My brother however, does not. He won't listen to me if I try to tell him what he's actually done and how horrible of a person he is. He still talks to him every single day. He simply rolls his eyes if I try to stop him. I'm so much happier without my dad. It's frustrating when others don't understand that."
unpopularopinion,fomijps,t3_g7oe4n,1587891323.0,"I cut off my dad when I was 13. I have no doubt he's a high functioning sociopath; he used me, my mom and my brother our whole lives (I won't go into detail) and had an affair with a teenager who I thought was my friend for years. He constantly manipulated us, telling us how sorry he was and how much he loved us.. after each time we caught him sneaking off to see her again. My friend even saw them together and my dad said ""She's obviously lying, I would never do that!"" And then her mother called us and told us that it was definitely him. 

After realizing what he was, I completely stopped talking to him. I didn't say a word and didn't feel any remorse. I was finally free of this shell of a human being weighing me down my whole life. He never made an effort to see me after that, surprise surprise. My entire family including my brother knows full well what he did, yet have never even considered that he might be a bad person after all. They always give me attitude if I decline an invitation because my dad is going. They always speak highly of him, as if they've completely forgotten what he's done. I don't care at all whatsoever if I share some DNA with that monster. I haven't talked to him in years and don't plan to talk to him ever again."
