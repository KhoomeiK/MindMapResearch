I started crying. I held onto the dining table in front of me and broke down. My shadow was on the floor from the light that was on behind. Then I saw another shadow. Moving. It was of a man. From the size of the shadow it seemed he wasn’t standing beside me, rather a little to the side and behind me. I close my tearful eyes and told myself I was hallucinating. People were awake and I could hear them so this must be a hallucination. I opened my eyes to see the shadow still there. Not moving, just there, waiting.

I see your point in helping him out. My father has made awful financial decisions all his life, and that left us struggling for most of my life. When it came to my needs, he still did everything he could to send me to the best schools and get me the best medical help (I have shitty health). I started working this year in a role that was paying poorly and was not nearly enough to live very comfortably. Still my first thoughts were  pulling out a small chunk from my pay check, and give it to my father so that he has one fewer bills to worry about. While there is a cultural influence about helping your parents (I am brown btw), there is no obligation. I love him and this is my way of thanking him for forgoing all his comfort and slaving through for me for ever. 

I agree with the ‘marriage is a partnership’ view. I do not agree with all decisions, even if they are about money, being joint decisions. This is definitely an issue if you are forgoing things for your wife and kids in favor of your father. With your household income, I doubt that’s the case. Maybe have a conversation with your wife and see why this is bothering her. Might not be entirely about the money, but your general tendency to prioritize your dad over her."
