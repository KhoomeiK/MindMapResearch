AskWomenOver30,fibkw6t,t1_fiakuv7,1582324161.0,"Thankyou. Oh yes definitely wouldn't be the whole the weekend!
I'm curious how your clients stay on track without weighing? I'm fairly new to this 'having a pt' thing.

My pt does flexible dieting. So basically we can eat whatever we want as long as it meets our macro targets.
At the moment she has me on the deficit phase to lose some fat, she said she'll increase my calories soon because being in deficit too long isn't great for the body. But being in deficit also means that trying to fit in a dinner with friends can be hard without eating nothing but eggs the rest of the day haha"
AskWomenOver30,fibkhwz,t1_fiabwup,1582323915.0,"That's great! Thanks. Yes, I've been disciplined for sure."
AskWomenOver30,fibkcu2,t1_fiaak7k,1582323828.0,"Thankyou. I've looked into IF many times and have family that swear by it. I'm just one of those people that does not do well when I'm hungry. Also I've read that what actually works from that diet is the fact that you're effectively eating less because you have a smaller time frame to eat which is the same as a deficit diet. There's been studies where people were made to eat the same amount of calories in their normal diet while only eating them in the limited hours and there was no change to their weight like expected. 
In saying that though, like I said, I have family that swear by it and the mental clarity they get so I think if it works for you, then that's amazing and you should keep it up."
AskWomenOver30,fibjwfa,t1_fiaaj5v,1582323543.0,"Wow amazing! Thank you! Will have a read through.
Yes, I was trying to think about the escape part of binging. I have depression but an also very aware of myself so was trying to assess if there was anything more happening in the background. There's things happening with family and work, but then there always is so I don't think it's emotional..... But then sometimes these things catch you of guard."

AskWomenOver30,fi9xwnp,t1_fi9xg4j,1582286991.0,I've been trying to do that with flexible dieting (just hitting macros/calories with no limits on foods) but sometimes the amount of pasta and beer I want just doesn't fit hahaha
AskWomenOver30,fi9xu2v,t1_fi9xalz,1582286913.0,"I guess maybe that's the fear of failure. That maybe that one day will start a bad routine....

I just want chips so bad lol and I can certainly try to work them into my diet (because I'm not limited on foods, I just need to hit my macros/calories) but I can never seen to make it fit... Because I guess it shouldn't really because it's unhealthy hahaha"

I think that's exactly how I was thinking about it, as a failure, which makes me question why would I want to fail. 
My personal trainer always says that if you have a bad day with food then to just move on but I think the fact that I haven't had the bad day, it's just in my head is like I still have the choice and it's bugging me."
