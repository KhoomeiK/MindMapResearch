mentalillness,fqxkjhq,t3_gl3513,1589733726.0,"There is nothing more dangerous than a child with mental health issues and parents who refuse to get them help. I’d reach out to the kid. Just be like “hey, I know things have been rough since your brother passed and your mom has said some things that worried me. I just want to let you know if you ever need anything I’m here and I’d be more than happy to help or listen” (obviously tailored to a more personal set up, but you get the idea). As a mentally ill young adult who spends most of her time around also mentally ill guys my age, they have to come to you, like a cat. All you can do is open the door. If you go straight at him with “I know you’re not doing well and I want to get you help” he’ll almost certainly deny it, especially with those kind of parents.

If he’s a legal adult and he responds well to your offer, then I’d suggest trying to find mental health resources for him and bringing them up to him. He’s more likely to take them if they’re handed to him, rather than “you should find a therapist”. The more he understands the more likely he will be open to treatment.

I really hope you can work this out, wishing you the best of luck"

Don’t ever expect anything from uvic’s administration. Nothing works, theyre not nice, and theyre not on time. The education might be good here but the experience was trash (I’m supposed to grad next year but if they don’t drop courses schedules soon that might get fucked up).

You might try finding an article or something that explains it for outsiders, even if it’s designed for a romantic partner the logic will hold. I have a really really hard self actualizing, and therefore I can’t really explain my BPD. Maybe that’s just the case with you too? It makes sense in our heads cause we experience it, but to mentally healthy people we might as well be talking about dragons. It’s really hard for them to get.

I’m 21 now, and it’s only just starting to set in how fucked that was. At the time I was like “oh ok lol, that’s cool, not dead so who cares” and I definitely think it’s related to BPD.

Don’t have any other insights though, sorry"
BorderlinePDisorder,fqou413,t3_gjd5ga,1589524908.0,"I’m new to this diagnosis, but mainly I’m trying to rationalize all my thoughts. Taking a moment to go “is this real?” Before I act on it. I’m writing lists of ways BPD makes me feel that aren’t true (ie no one loves me), and things that are true that it makes me forget (ie I am worthy of love). I started this like yesterday so I can’t really comment on how well it works, but based on what I’ve read, it should.

It’s really really hard for me to think about my own thinking (which is just a symptom). It’s like I’m looking at my own thoughts through an incredibly dense fog, and trying to read what they say. I have to ponder each thought for a significant time before I understand it. I’m focussing on the recurring arguments and fears mainly.

Understanding why you feel the way that you do is half the battle. Then you have to accept it, allow yourself to feel it, and still know that it’s not real. Unfortunately that’s about all I’ve found to help, but I bet there’s more. Google google google is all I can say"

I had the same reaction as you, relief that there was some reason and I’m not just crazy. While I feel much more validated, it has not helped my issues at all. I also haven’t received an official diagnosis, but I am 99% sure.

I’m trying to get in touch with counsellors online right now because my relationship is falling apart. I’ll get incredibly upset and attack him for not doing enough and then look back and go “what the fuck, he’s doing fine, it’s me”. And he has shortcomings, but for the majority of it, I’m overreacting to something that for the most part doesn’t exist.

Try talking about it. The more research I do the more I understand, the more I can explain it to him. We’ve been together since 2016 and our relationship is right on the fence, I’m lucky he loves me so much because I’m a disaster. 

I’d recommend trying to access online counselling. If you can’t afford it I know there are resources to help, depending on where you live. Apparently with psychotherapy BPD can be pretty much cured, and it has way better outcomes than depression. Don’t put it off. I was fine at 16, this is a disease that worsens into early adulthood, you will not go uphill on your own. I just wish I’d known sooner.

Good luck, keep on fighting"
BorderlinePDisorder,fqosub0,t3_gk2mth,1589523825.0,"Depending on what country you’re in, I’ve seen massive efforts to mobilize mental health resources online. I’m in Canada and my province just launched free counselling for all post secondary students (not COVID related, just convenient timing), and every counsellor I google is doing online sessions. 

I’m connecting with a therapist for the first time myself, and it’s difficult, but definitely doable! I’d encourage you to try a video chat with one, I can’t comment on their effectiveness but if you like them when this returns to normal you can see them in person as well. Or you can find someone more qualified for BPD treatment further away.

SuicideWatch,fpb9k88,t3_gcb1kz,1588465038.0,"I am not in as bad a situation as you but I have pretty severe Crohn’s disease that likely will result in me having a colostomy bag some day, potentially never eating solid food again, so I have that to look forward to. I also experience chronic exhaustion because of it and am a barely functional human. There’s a long list of mental conditions, and I barely sleep as well. I have maybe 1/10th of your suffering and I am still struggling to survive. 

I’m so sorry you were dealt these cards. The only thing that I can say, is don’t give up quite yet. As a woman your health will never be taken as seriously, and you have to push and push and push to receive adequate care. I truly believe there are medications and treatments that could significantly ease your suffering. 

I am about to graduate with a degree in biology and I just want you to understand something VERY important before you make the choice to take the assisted suicide route.

We are so so so so so SO close to a break through with CRISPR gene editing. Currently, scientists are at the point where they can remove the HIV gene from 51% of a rats cells. Needs to be 100%, but it was 0% just 5 years ago. Gene editing, once we have a method to deliver it to every one of the cells in a body, will be able to eliminate ANY genetic disease. It’ll take some time, maybe a decade or so, but in your lifetime I almost guarantee that there will be a cure for both your autoimmune diseases (and mine!). Because autoimmune diseases are mutations in your immune system, the area that the genes need to reach is solely where your white blood cells are produced, making this one of the most practical conditions to treat with gene editing.

The actual editing of the gene is so simple and we can do it perfectly already, the only issue is delivery. It’s been studied very hard and many many scientists are focused on it, because it would completely change the face of medicine. 100x the impact that antibiotics had. Please look into it if that’s at all interesting to you, it’s so amazing to me, science is one of the few things I still enjoy. I would recommend immigrating to a country with universal health care (come to Canada, it’s nice), because the cost will be astronomical in the US. If money isn’t an issue, you’re set. It’ll likely be experimental for a few years, and you might be able to get it for free in a clinical trial.

TLDR: in your lifetime, there will be a cure for these diseases. And there will be treatment for the damage they have already caused. If you can hold on, one day you will be able to live a normal life. I want you to live so badly so that you can experience this with me (figuratively), and so many others. This is literally a medical miracle. Hold on love, you can do this ♥️"
SuicideWatch,fpb6z0x,t3_g6fbu3,1588463427.0,"My boyfriend is relatively mentally healthy. He has bad days. He always says I let one thing ruin my day, but he missed the other 99 things that went wrong before the one that broke me. Neurotypical people will never understand and I kinda think our relationship is doomed because of it. I am chronically physically ill with several incurable and life changing conditions. Mentally I have just about everything under the sun wrong with me (that’s an exaggeration, but it’s at least 4 confirmed), and I don’t live a good life. Every day is a bad day. 

Even my friends with mental health issues say “find a hobby” or “just remember it’ll get better”. I wanted to kill myself at 14 and at 21 it’s not much different. Has improved slightly however as I have less body dysmorphia now that I’m underweight.

I have friends. I am getting an education. I have a loving family. But every day is a struggle to even exist. I shudder to think of people in my situation who do not have those positive things.

I saw a quote one time “maybe life just isn’t for everyone” and sadly, it is true. We are evolutionarily inferior, we have a mutation in our brains that causes these feelings. In nature, when these negative mutations arise, they usually result in the demise of the individual, so the gene can not be carried on to another generation. We keep these people alive when nature didn’t intend for that, and thus we spread the mutation, giving more and more people this horrible life. 

I should’ve died due to medical conditions when I was 13. I didn’t. I was 2 weeks away from death according to the doctors. I had mental issues before that but never had real problems til after. Makes me feel like I was only programmed to live that long and now I’m somewhere I’m not supposed to be. 

I fucking hate people who say “it’ll be ok” and “there’s better days” because for them it’s true. And sometimes it is for me. But I don’t want to live 9 bad days for every 1 good one, and that’s how it’s been for over half a decade. I don’t want to suffer for the rest of my life.

That said, some people do recover somewhat from depression, at least to a point where they can enjoy life. I don’t want to give false hope but maybe, one day, it might be you. Or me. It’s the only thing that keeps me alive. It’s a tiny chance but it’s never zero (hated stats but that’s the most useful thing it taught me). The chance is never zero.

The only thing I can say is please don’t kill yourself, just in case it’s you. Imagine if you did commit suicide and then found out (via whatever you may believe in, or not) that had you stayed, it would’ve gotten better. Fear keeps me alive. And that’s not a bad thing."
