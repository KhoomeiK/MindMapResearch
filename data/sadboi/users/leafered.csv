Over the partner income free area of $994 per fortnight, every dollar of income reduces the person's JobSeeker Payment by 60 cents. 

For JobSeeker Payment (including Energy Supplement), the current cut-out for a couple in which only one partner earns income is $1,858.50 per fortnight or $48,321 per annum.

From 27 April 2020 the taper rate for the partner income test associated with JobSeeker Payment will change from 60c to 25c. This change is temporary and will operate until the Coronavirus Supplement ceases to be payable. As a result of this change, the new partner income test cut-out for JobSeeker Payment will be $3,068.80 per fortnight.‚Äù

You have a right to stand up for what is the correct thing to do in this circumstance, and mention to your boss, that staff are best to avoid crowds and contact with anyone other than family and other colleagues where necessary. If they are not happy with this, can you request to be stood down? 


However, your boss also is forking out the bill until the subsidy begins to be paid. You made the cut, you were useful enough to not get fired, you‚Äôre getting $200+ more or something a week than people who lost their jobs, and you have a job to go back to.


It is reasonable to only expect you to work as much as your regular wage until you get up to $750 a week in gross wage. It is reasonable to find something for you to do in hopes of bringing more business in, in the future.


It is also reasonable for you to request a safer way to work, surely there is work you can do remotely, or in the office away from the public. Can you have an open discussion with your employer?"

You should be eligible for JobSeeker if you are only working a few hours. It is frowned upon to resign, and a bad idea, however, if you do want to leave, I‚Äôd ask your boss to stand you down, if they‚Äôre cool. Centrelink often cut payments if a job seeker refuses work, and I wouldn‚Äôt quit at potential earnings, that‚Äôs silly.
