 Ugly people can still be fuckable if they have a nice body. But no one wants to fuck a fat person, which is why I have fat people near the bottom.

 Also, you have to look at the support systems that ugly girls have, while ugly men have none because society sees you as the privileged gender. Seriously how many body positive commercials and ads have you seen for women? Now name one where you see society telling men it's okay to have man boobs and a dad bod. 

I'm not saying ugly girls don't have it hard. They certainly do, but they have so many tools at their disposal to make them more attractive. Foundation for bad skin, waxed brows for bad eyebrows, fake eyelashes, blush, etc...
