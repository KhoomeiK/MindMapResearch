Even the stereotyping of the main 4, I actually remember sitting down and laughing with my family at it all since I knew so many other geeks that were just into all the same stuff the main cast was, and several even acted the way they did. 

Like, going into that show in the late 2000s helped show a side of the world that not many others explored. We all were friends with at least one person that could fit into the catigories. (Needlessly obsessive about routines and being all too literal, the nerd who enjoyed the stuff secretly wanted to just be normal like everyone else but didn't have the self esteem to really accept their interests as normal, the super creepy guy who thought he was a ladies man but really wasn't, and then the person who just couldn't ever work up the nerve to ask anyone out they thought was too good for them.)

To be honest, I don't think living with other people is a good solution. Back when I did live with my parents many years ago now, we constantly fought and argued. Normally with one or more people going away in tears. 

When I did end up with a roommate on my own, friend from HS who was working at the same place as me but another contract, we had very poor communication and he had a complete disregard for any of the pre-established ground rules.  We lived together for like, 8 months? and by the end of it if he didn't move out one of us was going to kill the other. 

So that probably also soured me. Then the call center beating any empathy I had for other individuals out of me with policy for what can and can not be done, no matter how much you feel for a person. (Last 7 years I've not had a 'social' life outside of the occasional friend visit out of the blue or for specific holidays. Social life has been purely online otherwise and its not been too bad.).


I'm sure there is a lot of wisdom in what you are saying about learning people, and its great to learn.

But, just... I only recently discovered what I want to do with my life. 3 weeks ago I was planning out my budget and the steps needed to see the future through. Now? I'm fearful. 

I dread going into work every day. They insist they are doing all the best preventive measures that they can. Disinfecting everything, wiping everything down, keeping people apart. But, the fact of the matter is, the job can be done from home. We don't HAVE to come in, but they haven't been able to get the okay for us to work from home. So its looking more and more likely we will be forced home. 


From a logic perspective, I know I should be still going in. I need the money. They are not giving any disciplne actions if they call off though. 


Its just..., I really don't want, if this is to, in thoery be our last few weeks (No one knows if they have it or not, or how badly it will affect them. Which is the scary bit), I really don't want to spend that time at a job I hate and am only still sticking with because it helps me reach the future I actually want. I would rather be staying home and doing the stuff I want to actually do with my time."

I've been interested in 'crossdressing' for years now simply because of how much choice women have in clothing over men. Give more choices! I would actually be interested in buying clothes. Current mens fashion I 100% hate the look and feel of, just something about it that feels restricting in my mind."

You'd be surprised at how long most stuff will last when frozen. Though stuff like Flour, potatos, rice and sugar pretty much never expire in a reasonable time anyway, so the other bits are either canned, packaged or frozen. All the fresh stuff I use within the first week, maybe 2 tops on most orders.

Edit: Carrots also last a fair bit of time. Mushrooms are 2ish weeks or a little more before it becomes 'bad'. Sure most of it isn't fresh or the best after a few weeks in the fridge/freezer, but at least with me, it also doesn't make me sick. Espescally if I cut off any part that looks odd and it has no bad smell."

All in all, I'm sitting on about 2+ months worth of food at the moment. So I spent some of my excess money on a nice chiefs knife so I can practice cutting and chopping while isolated.

Guildwars2,fkwd63n,t1_fkvxzwd,1584589257.0,"Remember how long it took for them to give us sitting in chairs? 

There was so much tiny stuff that they had promised even all the way back in beta that they never got around to fully until the last 2 years. There is no way the company has this many 'incompetent' people at the helm. 

Most likely whats going on is that the people who made the code orginally are no longer with the company and didn't fill anyone in properly on the details of what was where. 


Friend works in the coding field and one thing he constantly talks about is how if Coder A writes code, then most times only Coder A will ever fully understand said code and if Coder B tries to learn it, its a set of trial and error of tracking everything down. Despite everyone using the same coding language, each coder has their own way of doing the code in a way that makes it work for them. 

And then over the years you can also get things like Code Rot where so much stuff gets added, eventually older stuff starts to fall apart."

Complaining that one set of animations or outfits is bad because its Feminine, but praising another set because its masculine does seem counter intuitive.

Guildwars2,fkwc1oy,t1_fkvvg48,1584588441.0,"> Just the fact a default animation made the heavy shoulder pieces clip through our own head during stretching was problematic by itself and would be worth fixing or finding an alternative.

Been a long time since i played GW2, but going off of FF14, I think clipping will almost always exist for most cases when it comes to clothing. Longer hairstyles for instance constantly clip through stuff in FF14, both on PCs and NPCs. I don't see how the shoulders issue in GW2 is any different then having say longer hair clipping in another MMO. 

Both are clipping. Idle animations they can not turn off though so I see the issue there, that said it can't be that hard to add a toggle of idle stances to the game."
Guildwars2,fkwbomj,t1_fkva280,1584588178.0,"Personally, I think the best course would just be to do what FF14 does. Let people cycle freely through the idle animations they want to use, that way it still gives everyone some individualism and they can still keep it unique for each race. 

I actually remember the stretching animation and used to love it back then, but its also been forever since I last played. Surely though it can't be that hard to code in a toggle to switch idle animations per character."

Most sensible people have already expressed concern at work. That said, despite rules in place at work for people to be 6 feet apart, our desks are NOT 6 feet apart, and there is more then 50 people on the floor at any given time. 

Medical places have gone on lockdown, a few other centers have closed, but we are still open. Waiting till we get the notice from the government to force us to shut down. If that happens then I know I won't have enough money for rent next month. So I am hoping they can implament that work from home idea. BUT there is still some set up I have to do for that. 

What seemed to really get people last night was the rumor liquor store is closing today. With that it started to get in a LOT of peoples minds how serious everything is.
