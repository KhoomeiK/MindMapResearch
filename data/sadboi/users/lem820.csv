3/5/20 Start 2.75 mg/day X...(did have some uncomfortable feelings but manageable for a few days till bod had time to adjust

3/12/20 2.25..ya, a big jump...felt horrible for a few days to adjust..

3/23/20  2.0   (notice decreasing in.25 increments) and staying for about 10 days-2 wks

4/3  1.75  (again the decrease is noticed about 3-4 days in.--manageable)

4/10  1.50 (good n bad days; manageable)  stayed at this for the longest 

5/10 (one month later ) 1.25...am into this dosage about 3 days or so..nothing remarkable...yet..

Plant to stay at 1.25, hopefully just 10 days, then down to 1.0...or if I'm chicken, maybe 1.125....(half of a .25 cut)

I believe it can be done...have not gotten to doses below 1.0 yet..may change my tune:)

You can do it..but requires patience and a slowwwww taper..Those 2 attributes go hand in hand..

I still should go see a psych..just have some stress related issues to deal with plus family junk...

I have not smoked any MJ but do take Kratom..not gonna give that up till Im off X...it is truly the devils bane...still kicking myself over ordering off the net..

I have quit alcohol and opiates with Kratom..the desires to drink or take those Norco's r no longer there..

Healing slowly...

Its OK to be a loner...I am one too..only child syndrome:)..in fact, I kinda enjoy it...hubby is an only child too, so we understand each other..well, sorta.:)

Not sure what ur dosage/time used/which benzo u were taking..etc..BUT I have read many peoples' stories on here that it takes TIME to heal..

Question I have for u is: What are u anxious about right now?...Is it employment, health, this quarantine, school (not sure how old u are), family?...I know that when my anxiety is the worst is when I have to climb up out of my shell and interact with other people..be it family, market, or friends..I am having to re-learn my interpersonal skills..I saw one psychiatrist and he scared me...was looking sideways at me listening while I was talking bout my job at the office, he got pissed at me for buying benzos off the net..(stopped that)...got hubby as my ""pill police""..he sets out my daily allotment of Xanax/day..do u have anyone who could be ur support person right now??...I gave him my stash of Xanax, Valiums (still in blister pacs)...but I keep trodding on and downward...it is an accomplishment as u have done..You should be proud of your accomplishment of being totally off that junk...I am proud of you!!!..

Sorry, I guess I rambled a bit above there, but my main point was/is to live in the moment..dont worry too much bout the future..if u have a support person, lean on them...if u dont have one, might be a good idea to seek one out...psychiatrists are useful BUT some can really mess with ones head(like mine did--I did not go back to him)..

When u are feeling anxious, try to identify WHAT it is ur anxious of, and if possible, AVOID those situations which might trigger the anxiety..

I also was addicted to alcohol a few years back..now take Kratom which totally got me off the sauce...If u do drink, might be a good time during this quarantine to cut down or even stop as it interferes with the same benzo receptors in ur brain which are trying to heal..GABA..

As the OP says below, ""Struggling is still succeeding""...

This quarantine gets to me as well..I go out for a drive in the neighborhood, put some ole disco music on and sing..:)...yes, I'm from that era...:):)...I also do crossword puzzles....games.latimes.com

I wish you an anxiety-free day today, wherever u might be...stay strong..U are off those devil pills..quite an accomplishment..relish in that fact!!:):)

Keep us posted LDW....we all are in various stages of this battle...but u are on the precipice of being totally free, I can sense it..
