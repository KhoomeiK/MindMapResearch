Not seriously (I've never has sex with anybody but him) and he still stays with me. I think because he understands I'm unstable. But he does not support my diagnosis being an excuse and neither do I. It's my job to stay balanced and learn to handle this problem even though it's difficult. It upsets me though that me doesn't support the label or treatment. I've never been on medication and I don't want to be right now but if I need it in the future, I might take it on. He would never support be being medicated though. He has  been diagnosed mental illness before too, but he believes the label makes the ""issue"" worse or allows it to be an excuse for behavior. TBH, I kinda agree. Mental illness = having a brain ""normal"" people don't understand and ""normal"" society does not support. Thoughts?"
