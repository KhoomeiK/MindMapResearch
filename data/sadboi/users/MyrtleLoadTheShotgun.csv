UniversityofKentucky,four01f,t3_g9nnac,1588088955.0,"If you want a traditional dorm room experience, Ingels, Holmes, and Baldwin are 2 person to a room, classic dorm styles. On south campus, if you're looking for one of the apartment style.dorms, the woodland glens are great. They're close to the library so that was nice when I lived on campus. One upside to the south campus dorms is that they're way closer to K lot and the other parking garages so if you're bringing your car that's something to think about if you want convenience. Also, on south campus you can park your car in the library lot/ the lot right in front of WG2 on the weekends, which was always nice. On the other hand, north campus dorms are way closer to most classes and honestly the food at the student center is better than the food at the 90 (the south campus dining hall) so that was an upside. I can't really speak on the central halls (Haggin, Lewis, Johnson) because I don't have any experience with them. I know that they're mostly apartment style. I'm not sure how all the dorms are segregated, but I know in Chellgren Hall (Woodland glen 1) there were males and females on floors together. Roommates are single sex though. Hope this helps!"

ptsd,f36wzt3,t3_dfxido,1570718684.0,"The stigma of people with PTSD is real. I didn't even realize I had it. I was in such inner turmoil wondering why I couldn't ""just get over"" something that happened to me. I wanted so bad to just be able to ""get over it"". I never even realized that there was an actual explanation of why the tiniest things would set me off, why I would cry and have a panic attack when I was reminded of what happened to me. I thought before that it wasn't even possible for me to have this. It makes me sad how people don't take people with non combat PTSD seriously, so thank you for this."
