I got a notification of your post, saw your pic and I came here to say that you are gorgeous. You're glowing! 

Wishing you nothing but happiness and success. ♡"

Thank you so much, I hope so too. My son is such an amazing little human and he deserves the best.

mentalhealth,foscurq,t1_fosc4f5,1588028226.0,"I think it's because my dad always told me that they're quacks that just try to shove pills down my throat that'll make me suicidal. The one time I reached out for help because of PPD they gave me pills and I became more suicidal. 

I have insurance! That was one of my excuses for a while because a few years back I got bumped off because I ""made too much"". I finally made myself lose that excuse right before COVID-19. The co-pay will be at least $50 per session. I feel in the beginning at least I should go every week if that's what they recommend. Especially if I'm going to be put on medication. I'm scared of having those same feelings."

Taking a day off IS taking care of your mental health. And your friend sounds like an unsupportive person in your life and I think it's time to evaluate your friendship to make sure they're not holding you back or causing you more stress. Just cause someone may have it harder doesn't mean your problems don't matter. I have had it harder than a lot of my friends and they were the ones that said that. They feel bad when they complain to me because it's nothing compared to some of the things I went through. I tell them that their problems matter to me and I am down to help in any way I can."

You're beautiful, cute, adorable, etc. And that's only from what I see. 
Take control of your life in other ways. Eat healthy, exercise, ditch the asshole boyfriend (that's 100+ pounds of weight gone) and just set reasonable goals for yourself to get to where you want to be in the future in your career.

You're being a bit of a diva. High school kids are jerks lol. Don't listen to their negative comments. They may be able to easily hit that note but like you said, the role calls for a baritone. You've worked your ass off for this. Enjoy it and stop paying attention to the butthurt children who are clearly just jealous that they didn't get the role. 

They're jerks if they are interrupting you when you are trying to practice. Especially if you go as far as to separate yourself and they follow you. That is extremely immature. 

Anyway, good luck at your show! You're gonna kill it."

AskReddit,evbip1d,t3_cj4apm,1564378945.0,My grandpa's girlfriend shooting herself. I was only like four. She was about 20 - 25 feet away from me. Not sure why she chose to do it so close to me. It was a big house and I was napping in my mom's bed upstairs. I remember waking up to the gunshot and after that I remember nothing. My mom told me what happened after I started having nightmares about it. My grandpa also tried to kill himself by driving into a brick wall on his motorcycle because of her suicide. He survived but has a glass eye and a limp now. It's crazy because I was around for all of this but after waking up to that gunshot I don't remember much for a while. I don't remember my grandpa being hurt. I don't remember my parents being taken in for interrogation. I don't even remember EMTs showing up. Just POP and a void.

mentalhealth,etkrs0c,t3_cc5hp6,1562906469.0,"Yeah, I don't know if that's legal because idk the laws where you are. You should definitely report her because that is so irresponsible and unprofessional. Number one, you're an adult so if you don't want a parent there then the parent should be asked to leave. Number two, her personal life has absolutely nothing to do with you. Her mom may have been great but not all moms are. Not saying yours isn't great but my mom was a major problem in my life and most of what I wanted to talk about was the stuff she put me through. Number three, what if you actually attempted suicide? What if you succeeded? It would be her job to report that you could be a danger to yourself. It is not her job to antagonize you or push you towards suicide. Her job is to give you a safe space to talk about whatever it is you choose to share. 

I am so sorry about all of that. I'm not a psychologist myself but I do have severe depression and I know what it's like to have someone tell me to kill myself. It hurts because you are trying so hard to push that option out of your head and get better but it always pops up. For me it's like whack-a-mole in my brain. Definitely find a new psychologist and report her."

 I didn't live in bars but I was brought to the bar on an almost daily basis. I was washing glasses, playing games, and people would buy me chips and soda. I wouldn't say that it had a negative impact. The bars we went to were relatively quiet and chill even when it was busy. It did make me prepare for drinking and driving so I can say the alphabet backwards. Thank God I realized that was wrong before I had the chance to risk hurting myself or anyone else.
