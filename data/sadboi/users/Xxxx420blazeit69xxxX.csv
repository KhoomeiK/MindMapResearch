What is wrong with telling stories to convey a message or for entertainment? Many cultures do this. People write stories now with metaphors and such to portray something. They want to give as much passion as possible to help further generations pick up on these ideals.

I guess my excuse is, I guess I haven't seen anyone care. I just said that I am willing to work to help moving society forward. I am not using religion to fight others, but to make the world a better place.

I've met very toxic people in the church while volunteering. I left those groups and put my time into other groups that focus on serving people. I make sure that the groups I lead have a leader who they can talk to and feels that he cares for them.

I have had opportunities in high school to go to the nearby juvy through the Catholic Church. This was not to punish them or even talk about Jesus and the Bible. This was just to give them a holiday party as many would not be able to see their families. No matter the crimes these children committed, or what they believed, we just wanted to make sure everyone had a good time during those two hour intervals.

PublicFreakout,fo783oa,t1_fo7062r,1587573871.0,"There are definately some parts that do and do not agree with science. I am a Roman Catholic Christian who grew up around the Catholic faith and still volunteer for the church. I have a couple of beliefs from my Christian faith that does keep me a Christian, even if I am not the most religious.

First of all, I believe Christianity is about the community. Most denominations celebrate mass together and pray together. Right now, even though we cannot meet in person due to the pandemic, priests are urging people to still remember that the mass and idea that Jesus saved us brings us together. I have always felt as an outcast, but feel that it is my duty to include others and to serve society.

We all have a purpose. I believe mine is to build new technology and point out new ideas that can ultimately protect and advance society. We are all called to share the word of Christ. I believe that actions are more powerful than words, so being inclusive, serving others, and being kind is what we are called to do.

In other religions, like in Greek mythology, it was very common to tell stories with passion for some purpose. This can be to teach an audience a lesson, to worship the heavenly, and/or just for entertainment. They would exaggerate details to help the story fulfil its purpose.

Christianity started before many could read and write. To help engrave stories of the Bible across generations, people would tell stories, sing songs, and keep traditions. For this reason, I do not think the Bible is 100% accurate physically. However, there is a lot anybody can learn from it spiritually.

Having said this, I think there is more to religion than blind faith. The Bible even mentions that God has a plan beyond our understanding. Just because we want something to happen does not mean it will. At the same time, I do not believe that you can pray cancer away. Many people studied subjects like medicine to help people live longer and better lives. Since Jesus said ""What you do for the least of my people, you also do for me"", I believe it is safe to say that God encourages us to learn more about the world God created to help others. If God really does want something, God is smart and we will not be able to stop it. Saying that improving technology limits God's plans is undermining the all-knowing God all Christians preach.

I'm sorry this is a long response, but does this help you understand my view?"

They may not understand how you feel. Communicate how you feel to the best of your abilities. Then, offer to listen to what is going wrong.

If the other individual has something going on behind the scenes, this can help them understand your side and possibly their side in a more healthy manner. If this is the case during the conversation, they will at least *attempt* to listen to you.

If they say everything is your fault during this time and do not listen to your view, distance yourself a little from this person. This can be a sign of a manipulative relationship. I have been in this situation, and sometimes people ask about you or pretend to help you for their ego. It really sucks because ultimately you feel at fault, even though it's not. This is a sign the relationship is not healthy. 

There is a lot of wonderful advice on this post. Please contemplate before acting. I hope you find something useful."
