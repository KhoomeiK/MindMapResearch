bettafish,fo4fmax,t1_fo4ewdo,1587503540.0,I have API stress coat that I use to dechlorinate the water. Luckily he can still see out of his left eye so like you said I'm going to try to make feeding time routine by tapping at the top of the tank. Why is the aquarium salt bad for bettas? I know alot of people use Epsom salt soaks but I didn't want to shock him.
bettafish,fo4e1na,t3_g5ng1k,1587502741.0,"So basically I found him mostly dead in a cup the other day and I couldn't bring myself to leave him there. I had an empty 10 gallon that was cycling and though not completely done cycling I figured it couldn't get worse than his cup. 

He was labeled as a dragon scale so I am thinking he had a scale grow over his eye though I initially thought it was popeye. He is super underweight, and is constipated. He had poop hanging out of his butt when I got him, and when he tried to poop in the tank it was stringy and stuck to his butt. However, his poop is brown so this is a good sign. 

I'm doing two water changes a day to keep the ammonia down. I have added aquarium salt and some indian almond leaf extract. I also fed him half a pea to try to help with the constipation.

He is super lethargic, I have been leaving the light off and added an airstone to get some aeration in the water. I'm not sure if it does anything but I figured it couldnt hurt. 

Let me know if you have any advice."

AskReddit,flpn8o3,t3_fpyb6k,1585363624.0,"I worked at a grocery store for about 4 years. The owner was a complete creep and would make sexual remarks and date literal 18 year olds when he's well into his 40's. I didn't get paid well for the work I was doing because I wasn't sleeping with him like the GM and AGM. He would talk shit about me to everyone but then practically worshipped the ground I walked on in front of me because I worked my ass off for that store. 

He was a huge creep and I hated even looking at him. When I finally quit for good I laid my apron, name tag, and keys on his desk all nice and neat. Even though I didn't tell him off because I need the reference it was so nice to be able to let him know I was NEVER coming back."

I'm now using a sponge filter and my water is so much cleaner. This is just my experience with the tank though.
