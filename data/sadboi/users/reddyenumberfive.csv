Broadway,fqsll1h,t1_fqsjve5,1589610791.0,"Because broadway shows are super expensive to produce, incredibly complicated to film, and often involve a ton of people. I love theater, and I wish I could experience more of it, but like someone above said, the costs of recording a show in a format people will actually enjoy are pretty high. Theater isn’t set up for a royalty structure, so a commercial filming also adds the issue of trying to figure that out for everyone in the cast. Plus, there’s the part where filming things on a stage is logistically tricky because of things like theater/cast availability. They can’t do it during an audience performance, but there’s not really a lot of other time that the cast can all be in the theater without like, blacking out shows that bring in money needed to help recoup production costs (more shows than you might guess never turn a profit) or somehow finding a way to get the cast to give up multiple days off (because there’s no way they can get it all perfect without multiple attempts) in order to accommodate the filming. 

It sucks that we can’t all see every show we want. I live in Colorado and have missed tons of things that really would have meant a lot to me. That doesn’t mean I think it’s reasonable to expect an entire industry to shift gears to something they aren’t really set up for and often don’t have resources for in the first place. It’s also nonsensical to claim theater needs to make shows available now because no one can go out because...the people involved can’t go out to perform in the first place, and if they could, they wouldn’t be shuttered right now. 

If theater ever does start broadening their filmed offerings, expect them to be considerably more expensive than the latest marvel movie."

You’re well within your right to have whatever menu you like, but I think vegan/vegetarian folk can forget just how many tricky ingredients often take a major role in vegan foods. Nuts and nut milks, for example, are super common ingredients in vegan foods, but nut allergies are super common and a lot of people won’t think to ask if they’re in something they wouldn’t expect. Mushrooms are also something I see as a central component of vegan dishes, and they’re also pretty commonly disliked. (And maybe it’s just me, but it seems like most people I know who dislike them, dislike them to an unbearable degree.) Grains can be tough for those trying to limit carbs. Personally, I can’t eat anything with lots of cooked tomato because my stomach just can’t handle it. 

My honest advice is to put together a list of possible menu options together far in advance, and run it by some non-veg attendees to see if they can point out anything specific that could cause issues you’re not aware of. Chicken isn’t the most common catering staple because it’s everyone’s favorite - it’s because most people eat it and it’s hard to completely ruin it unless it’s under/overcooked."

(This was edited in after this was pointed out to me, so original post follows)

NAH, but I’m saying that with some reservation because it could also just as easily be ESH. You are 100% in the right for being upset about not being paid back, but if your parents don’t have it to spare, and they aren’t spending frivolously, they can’t make it appear out of thin air. I will say they’re ah for saying you should pay rent when you’re a) only sixteen and wouldn’t reasonably be living anywhere else, and b) have already handed over such a significant amount of your money, but I’m willing to shake it off as an “in the heat of the moment” thing they might regret if they haven’t brought it up again. 

The sad truth is that your parents may not be able to pay you back, even if they really wish they could. If the problem is that they overbought for the house, their only solutions are to either get second jobs or sell the house and downsize, both of which may not be very possible for various reasons. Hindsight is twenty twenty for all involved here. They should have bought a less expensive house, and they should have tried finding a solution that didn’t bring you into it. I’d say your best bet at this point would be to go to another adult they respect (maybe a relative or a school counselor) and ask them to help you talk to your parents about not lending them more money in the future. You moving out at 18 will lower their expenses and there’s a chance that getting them to understand that further loans will delay that and could ultimately  cost them more might be your best bet here.

If you ever decide you want to tell her, I’d suggest starting by telling her you once had a boyfriend whom you later found out had been married and cheating on his wife. Tell her how badly you felt about it when you found out, and how you’d never have done it had you known he was married at the time. Wait to see how she responds to that, then let her know that what makes it even harder is that you later met his ex wife and you hate knowing you could have played a part in hurting her. Again, wait to see how she takes it, and if she seems understanding and supportive, then you might be able to consider the big reveal.

2.

Anyone who would get mad after hearing your explanation would probably be the kind of person you don’t want to be around much, anyway."
povertyfinance,ffh1o1x,t1_ffgzmrd,1579920716.0,Seconding this! I had a cavity fixed by a student last spring and it was one of the best dental experiences I ever had. Bonus - she actually paid me for “letting” her work on me because it was for her exams. I got my cavity filled and walked away with a crisp hundred dollar bill in my pocket. Nothing to complain about!

AmItheAsshole,ffh08lo,t1_ffgrphx,1579919632.0,"Am I the only one who thinks a guy not wanting to get snipped so he can potentially have kids with a second wife if he divorces his current wife is a major red flag? I mean, I know the future is uncertain, but do people in happy, healthy marriages really think like this? I mean, my marriage was pretty much a disaster, but even so, I never even considered planning for a second marriage while I was still in it."
AmItheAsshole,ffgzpwj,t1_ffgvkxp,1579919242.0,Tiny is right. My boyfriend’s incision was less than half an inch long.

AmItheAsshole,ffgpbd0,t3_eti13j,1579911640.0," NTA for not wanting to have unnecessary surgery, but everyone insisting your wife should get a tubal is very much an AH. Vasectomies are cheaper, quicker, less complicated, and less dangerous than tubal ligations. A vasectomy literally takes less than ten minutes and only requires a local anesthetic. (The sedation is a big factor for complications in most surgeries, so it’s one of the safest surgical procedures you can have.) My boyfriend had one just over a year ago and it was so non-dramatic that he talked to the doctor about skiing throughout the whole procedure. He was sore for a couple of days but that was it. Our sex life wasn’t bad before, but it’s only gotten better since, due to the added spontaneity and freedom. A++ would recommend. He’s not big on spending unnecessary money, and he’s said it’s some of the best money he’s ever spent."

AmItheAsshole,felphn4,t3_eptrld,1579227769.0,"YTA, but I think calling anyone an ah in this situation is a little harsh. You’re more than in your right to eat however you please, but it’s really unreasonable to try and make your boyfriend do the same if he isn’t doing it voluntarily. I have a hard time eating at a lot of vegan/vegetarian restaurants because of certain dietary issues I have, so if my boyfriend took your stance, I’d have to tell him that the only options were to break up or never go out to eat together again. What if you eventually decide to live together? Will he not be allowed to bring meat into his own home if he feels like eating it? Again - I totally respect your personal choice, and I understand where you’re coming from, but your choice is not your boyfriend’s choice, and if it’s really that important to you, it could be a sign that you’re just not ultimately compatible."

relationship_advice,fel4htt,t3_eppbv6,1579213873.0,"I’m actually dealing with the reverse situation with my boyfriend. He’s looking to buy a house this summer, and I’ll be moving in with him, if he does. He’s said he wouldn’t charge me rent, but I’m trying to get him to agree to letting me pay the recurring bills (Electric, trash, water, etc) so I don’t feel like a total freeloader. He’s not a controlling or misogynistic person at all, so I think his hesitation is mostly rooted in wanting to help me out after acquiring a hefty bit of medical debt or possibly not wanting to build equity off of money I’m paying him."
