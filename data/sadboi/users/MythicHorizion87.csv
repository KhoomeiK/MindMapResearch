The ground isn’t flat with lots of random holes, the tall grass making it hard to see. We eventually make it to the railroad. It’s a raised one way track and you can see straight in both directions. The train wouldn’t come for another half hour so we dieted to walk the tracks. It felt off. Like somebody was watching us. We shrugged it off and kept walking. 
The gut feeling was still there. I told Amelia about it again. She agreed. We looked around but saw nothing. Now this town is creepy. The tree farm has pentagrams carved into tree stumps. It’s scary. We walked quite a bit done the tracks and heard a faint scream. and the sound of the train. We looked at eachother and sprinted down the tracks back to the tree farm trying to make it back to her house as soon as possible. There wasn’t really much room to get off the tracks. The tracks were raised and we wouldn’t be able to get back on them if we got off. We raced off of the tracks and back out of the tree farm.
