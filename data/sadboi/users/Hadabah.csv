AskMen,fnghz6s,t1_fnfbf1n,1586932829.0,"> and a bit more outright bashing of my mental state and blaming me for it 

This is my experience and it does vary from person to person so what I decided to do about my case perhaps may not apply exactly to your situation but lemme give my take. That part above here is one of the reasons I decided to go to therapy- I was in a constant state of self-deprecating thoughts about myself and why I could not just ""man up"" and move on from anxiety, depression and constantly irritable, I was messed up. For a good while, I did not see myself getting better, or even think there was a chance at that. It affected my sleep barely slept more than 3 hours for over 8 months), poor eating habits, family relationships kept deteriorating and my friends started to dwindle. Problems at work. and the self-deprecating thoughts did not make it any easier. Around this time, my gf left. Honestly, that was the catharsis for me to go into therapy- I did not feel like I had a choice as it was either that or remain a bitter, resentful person.  

&#x200B;

>  is my current situation impossible for that? 

Honestly, if there is anything I have learnt in the past couple of months, anything is possible. Life can be exhaustively depressing but it can also be so beautiful. There is a poem by Nat Lipstadt ,""I hope you will be treated unfairly"". Read till the ending. We, humans, have a tendency to take things personally. Perhaps we should just let things come and go as they do (bad and good things as well). And if you keep working on your own thing, on your own improvement, am sure someone along will want to join along for the ride. Just be sure you have enough psychological resources to be able to put the needs of another person ahead of your own from time to time, otherwise, a relationship may be the last thing you need at the moment.

She dumped me a week later.  That stung!. Funny now though how I was so upset abt it- but hey, we are humans with them Feels. 

Cut her off completely (childish I guess but helped make things easier for me). 

Decided to focus on myself. Finished my 3rd month of psychotherapy this past Monday(father died a few months before she left, had some sexual assaults as a child, plus other issues), Been exercising regularly, eating healthy, gained some healthy weight, I go out, I have made new friends (funnily, 2 are women and they are amazing people), put more effort at my hobbies, going to a concert in a little under a month, this weekend am going to a writers guild event after being invited over by one of my new friend.......... as I type this, am smiling, I think am not depressed as much as I was. 

I had basically made her my only outlet for my psychological needs- which was not fair to the both of us. 

I have since expanded my horizons for pleasure and so far, it is working, I guess key is just to learn to thrive by yourself :-) .  This year I think I will use it to ""find myself""

Was at a low point in my life, my dad had died, family issues came up & she was more or less my only outlet- big mistake. Plus, being assaulted as a toddler by a woman did a number on me- always blind sided me; whenever a woman feigned the slightest interest even remotely, she was to be worshiped! silly me.

In psychotherapy for a few months now. it is working. Still a long way to go though.

My plan for this year; Increase my savings, plan for investing, self growth, focus on my hobbies (am going to concerts, events, doing math & programming, etc), planning for my masters, career. I dress better, I work out at least 6 hours a week, sleep better. I like how am growing. 

Focus on urself. For the first few weeks, don't ignore those lingering painful feelings u have for how it ended, instead, u can dedicate a scheduled time off each day, say for like 10 minutes at the end of the day, to process those feelings. And for the rest of the day, don't think abt them- remind urself that u have set aside a time to go over the fact that she just used u and discarded u like a toy.

1. Love yourself. You have to learn to really love yourself. And this is a hard thing for most people. Take care of your current self but also take care of your future self.
