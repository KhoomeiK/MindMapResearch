schizoaffective,fqqxnf7,t1_fqqwoi4,1589573829.0,"I often struggle with imposter-syndrome-like traits where if I'm ok for a few days I assume ""Maybe I'm just overreacting"" and that ""Maybe I made everything up"" (this is all with an official diagnosis/countless episodes that lead to said diagnosis). It's just one of those mind fucks my brain likes to do. Not sure if it's partly because I'm bipolar subtype"

BinghamtonUniversity,fpk2z5l,t3_gdvw3k,1588686937.0,"Hey! graduating senior here. I was in SSS for all four years of college and I gotta say, fucking loved it. It really made Binghamton feel like home to me. The community they build and the people you meet are seriously the people you'll be friends with probably forever. I met my closest friends through it. It's a government funded program so they have a lot of little extra resources and stuff (ie got a mentorship/internship because of it) but I mainly liked the Accademic Councelors--they're called this because they're there for both accademic and personal things. I actually got really close to my councelor and would barge in to his office unannounced like 2-3x a week--he was always accommodating and ready to listen, no matter how small the concern. They seriously take the time to know you know you if you put in some effort. I have literally nothing bad to say about sss because they seriously made my colleges transition/experience enjoyable. Like, when a lot of my peers were starting to get to the tough part of the semester (and therefore hating college as a whole) I would go to sss to talk to councelors/see my friends/tutoring/events, and that made things a lot better--you always feels like your opinions are heard because the staff actually gives a shit and will fight for you. I never felt alone."

LingerieAddiction,f80lvg8,t3_dydiom,1574132174.0,"Mm! I've bought several corsets from a UK brand called Corset Story and they have a lot of really cute styles! Also the QUALITY is super excellent. Like I wear the corsets as tops sometimes (all day) and they're super comfortable and provide great back support. 

Their return policy is really good too (I've had to exchange 2 corsets because they were the wrong size and it was really painless because you could track the return to the warehouse as well as the shipping to you). ALSO you can ask loads of questions and customer service gets back to you pretty quickly (in my experience anyway).

So I totally recommend them. They also have 2 for 1 or even 3 for 1 sales quite often and you can get really great quality corsets for much cheaper than they originally were (they're pretty pricey otherwise--at least for my college student self). 

So ya, not sponsored (god, I WISH) but I just really like and trust them. 

P.s. Definitely look at the sizing chart and make sure it's the one you're looking for (i.e. UK 6 is VERY DIFFERENT from US6)"
