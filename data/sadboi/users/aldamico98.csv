Pains me to say that because this part of me is fighting it, telling me its bullshit and you know I'm sure alot of it is just perception, but then a much calmer voice (metaphorically) tells me that whatever is ""real"" is what you put faith Into, what I choose to spend my time with.

Of course a case here and there has a connection but I want to beilive that 80 percent of the time, it's just adults doing weird human things. But I see exactly why people are scared of that, and have a watchful eye for people lile that. They fear what they dont know, and what they do know in that context only makes the situation worse.

Just remember that we are animals, pushed to be as comfy and well fed as possible. We might be a little more advanced but still, lion cloths or suits we are still tribal, and stick to our group. That's why we have ""men vs women"" ""black vs white""because our....unique nature makes us distrusting, selfish, arrogant, egotistical and overall a violent and territorial animal. We just understand things like pain so we invented morals. And over time adjusted to this weird tribal but more advanced than other animals self hierarchy. A issue is a issue because we feel like it is, to the natural world no of either sides issues are a real issue. Just the imagination of an ape.

The thought of a world haulting event like a global pandimic becomes more fantasy than a reality. Trust me when I say they are as afraid as you are, but preparing would mean they are reaffirming the fears. Its alot better to pretend it's nothing than to realize a brushfire is behind you, slowly burning it's way to you. You can smell it, you can hear the crackle of it, but as long as you dont see it. The heat you feel is just your imagination."
