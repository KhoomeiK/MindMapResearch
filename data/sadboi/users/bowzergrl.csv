OCD,et5b5p9,t3_c9pitj,1562468827.0,I do this ugh I bite my tastebuds off I've had to have it cauterized due to the damage :-/
AskReddit,et2xgp9,t3_c9ptp3,1562424443.0,"I have pretty bad OCD and I bit all the tastebuds off part of my tongue. I was driving for 5 hours and just kept biting and biting to the point where it looked like someone had taken a razor and shaved off an inch from the side of my tongue. It hurt so bad I couldn't even speak. Fast forward a day, my mom read that putting baking soda on it would help? My dumb ass put it straight on the tongue and omg did it burn. I was bleeding so bad I had to put a towel under my mouth and I fell asleep- woke up with a quarter sized blood clot on my tongue and freaked out. Went to the urgent care where the doc told me it was the worst tongue injury he'd seen. He then asked to ""see it"" and ripped the clot off with a piece of gauze. 

Oh but it gets worse- he then cauterized it shut with topical lidocaine and told me if it wore off it would be some of the worst pain imaginable. Ah but my blood pressure was too low (I'm a fainter) and I had to lay down for 45 min before I could go get my Vicodin from the pharmacy. I cried involuntarily from the pain. Luckily the doc told me it was all over w and it wouldn't break open. 

Alas...it ripped open. The next day was my college graduation. I still have a scar."

Been a miracle for me"
bipolar,es1rf90,t1_es09bjc,1561503824.0,I've managed not to gain any but I am def hungry. I work hard to monitor. With depakote I gained weight like crazy and never lost it

I get very very vivid intrusive images of him hooking up w other people and everything triggers me- hearing a certain name, hearing about a certain place in fact it's so bad that I actually quit all my social media so I wouldn't be possibly triggered. It's miserable"
OCD,eqntask,t1_eqns5yp,1560179953.0,"Ah very good idea! I've been trying to think of them as ""pop ups"". Poor guy he can tell when the light leaves my eyes and I'm having the intrusive thoughts lol. Ive been analyzing it and I think I have this stupid hatred that he's ever enjoyed another sexual experience besides with me =_=. I know it's irrational.  And the past doesn't dictate what's happening now. it makes me feel like a basket case sometimes. Yay thought fusion."
