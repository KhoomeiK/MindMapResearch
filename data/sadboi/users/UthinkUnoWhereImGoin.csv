I am so sorry you are having to go through this. I had a similar incident years ago with an ex and it was deviating to me, meant nothing for him. 


But you know what? Your heart, your energy, your body will heal. It may take time, therapy, crying, self-love, but you will heal. If he is unemployed, he doesn't need to be in the place you are paying for. Especially if he just takes what he wants without regard for others. I hope you are able to cut ties with his toxic ass asap. You deserve better. Your son deserves better, and most importantly he doesn't deserve to be raised thinking that is what love is, when it clearly isn't love for you or your SO. 

I know you will rise up stronger from all this. *Hugs*"
mentalhealth,fg8f2sm,t3_ex6ldv,1580617605.0,"Sorry this happened. 

For what it's worth I did the ghosting of a friend recently, it doesn't feel good to ghost someone either. I needed to move on from him and he kept reappearing in my life just to brag or seek council, bringing me back to the same mental spot I was in years ago and I had to walk away. 


But if you haven't talked in years, they may have just been culling their lists. Or deleted their social all together. It's the cool thing to do now, ya know. üòú"
tarot,ffwgs7m,t3_evck0g,1580300472.0,That is some incredible work! So glad the tarot inspires you in such ways this is fantastic!
tarot,ffvgyex,t1_ffvgtg8,1580263872.0,"I feel this to my core! 

Here's to healing ourselves, no matter the cost! üçª"
tarot,ffva1a7,t1_ffv9pn8,1580259231.0,Yes!!! And I think that is why I connected with tarot. It was a combination of 2 readers who I credit saving my life by way of saving my mental state. Forever grateful to the craft!!!
tarot,ffv6s3t,t1_ffv5s8y,1580257031.0,"Yeah definitely. Most of my clients have bipolar disorder, or some sort of thing they are struggling with. 

Honestly most of my readings tend to come out with a mix of ""you may not be getting this *right now*, but here's why..."" And ""that doesn't mean you won't get that thing you want, it's just there are lessons that need to be learned so you can truly appreciate it when it comes into your life. And you have the tools within you to learn these lessons! Here they are... You are great at XYZ..."" 

Even with readings that are hard pills to swallow, I wouldn't do anything other than telling people they aren't broken, they are perfectly unique, but Whatever they want hasn't come into their life right now because the universe is giving them an opportunity to connect with themselves, Learn the lessons they need, and love themselves right now so they won't feel dependant on someone else's choices, comfort, help, knowledge, etc.

I myself have gone through all the struggles in life one could think of, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. 

Anyone is capable of being the co-creator to their life, and I am here to help them discover the tools they have within themselves already to have the life they want. Bc I had to dig myself out of the trenches so I know it's possible.üòú"
tarot,ffv56zb,t1_ffv41sk,1580255943.0,"Oh, i definitely never slap people with doom and gloom, and of course people have to be mindful that someone who is coming for a reading may be in a fragile state.  

I am only stating that I've noticed for the readings I have peraonally done reversals seem to really only jump out for the people who are a bit more receptive to constructive criticism. I've thankfully not had many reversals when doing readings for someone in the more dire of emotional states."

tarot,ffuere9,t3_evaame,1580240424.0,"No, lots of readers don't read reverses. The meanings offer duality for most cards as it is, I have seen many just apply the meaning that best suits the entire spread/situation. 

For myself, I see the cards as friends. All friends have duality, good traits and bad traits and some bad traits you may never learn about unless they are having a really horrible day. So I read the reversals because I feel like life is more complicated than the upright readings dive into. For me, reversals help my readings break past the veil. But I have gotten accurate readings without reversals too. 

(I have also noticed reversals jump out more for clients who can handle them. Clients who like the bubblegum and sugar coated life advice tend to somehow not attract reversals as much.)"
tarot,fflwwla,t1_ffktcr4,1580045136.0,"Are you able to get accurate readings for yourself? Any time I try on myself my cards start playing games. 
Example:

Me: ""Will new love come into my life anytime soon?""

My cards: I dunno, will it? It's all up to you. Gotta get out of your comfort zone and handle that wall you're building, home slice. And most likely you will meet tons of fuckboys.
