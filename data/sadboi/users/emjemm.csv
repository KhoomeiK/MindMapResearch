It got to a point when I didn't really want to, but just gave in and did it anyway because that was what was expected of me. Sometimes I tried to make excuses but he'd convince me somehow. And it always had to end in his orgasm (but not necessarily mine). It's a fucked up thing, and even more fucked up I didn't realize it until looking back with hindsight and getting into a much more sexually healthy relationship. I'm so so glad you found someone like this!"

cornsnakes,fkswsxj,t3_fkf9yr,1584500250.0,"Yay!! Corn snakes are awesome, I hope you do end up getting one. It's great that you can check up on them twice a day - they'll be great to handle for sure, but imo it's also okay if you check on them less often. 

One recommendation would be to consider getting a juvenile cornsnake! I got my boy last year when he was about 1 year old and it's been really cool seeing him grow bigger. They also shed more when they're younger so it's cool to see that too.

As far as escaping, it hasn't happened to me yet! Make sure you get a sturdy cage with locks or pins that you will give you peace of mind every time you close it. You could also considering putting the snake in a room where you can close the door for further containment. 

I'm not an expert by any means, but I did tons of research and watched a lot of care guides before I got mine. Good luck! :)"
