endometriosis,flgeyr3,t1_flf7tii,1585140857.0,"Thank you. I‚Äôm already on Wellbutrin, I was actually taking half the dose because I was feelin better. Since I‚Äôm bipolar I have to manage the meds as I go along, if I feel a bit manic I have to drop the dose because I get insomnias and hyper. I‚Äôm going to mail my psychiatrist to see if I have to make any changes and try and stay calm whenever I feel like the world is crumbling down. About taking it slow: I look just the same, and have very little pain so it‚Äôs difficult to make others understand that I‚Äôm NOT well. I can‚Äôt go for a run, do stretching, yoga and all the works... I know I have to rest, but I feel like I‚Äôm being lazy and disappointing those around me. 
Anyway if I have to cry I will. And boy did I cry when I left the hospital and the day after. Day by day right. 
Thank you again"

He‚Äôs probably pissed your making such a fuss over something like that, or just gave up because he doesn‚Äôt have the money. 
If you‚Äôre willing to lose friends over (little amounts of) money then never, ever, ever do a purchase online with another friend. Also: your parents think you should lose a friend over 10‚Ç¨?"
