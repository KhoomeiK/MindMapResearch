Yes, of course the world will continue, which is kind of saddening that people are forgotten. There's 7.7+ billion unique people on this planet... that's insane.

I wished that there was a day for everyone in the world to pay respects to everyone who has died, everything man has done, and for all of the people currently alive going through hard times.

Well, the good thing is that I can talk to people and maybe try to help them with their problems in life, and convince people that things might get better for them hopefully, and help them so they would just have a good life, without so much pain. 

Well yes, but what makes life valuable is that it lives. Not that it dies. There's buildings, materialistic things that are very valuable, and they aren't ending, the way we do which sucks. People have made great things and never got to see how successful or helpful it would be for everyone in the future. That's why life is precious, not because people die, but because people do things.
