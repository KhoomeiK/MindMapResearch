TinyHouses,fqdwedz,t3_gic2i1,1589297758.0,"My boyfriend and I are in the process of building a tiny house. When we are completely finished with construction, we will have spent less than $25,000 on our home and we will own it. We went for a slightly larger tiny home (14'x40') because I wanted a sense of a normal house. It is definitely a big change though. If you are used to having an excess of stuff and don't feel like you can part with the majority of it, a tiny house may not be for you."

relationships,flp4dnc,t3_fq6e40,1585351424.0,"Absolutely not. As someone with BPD, I know that it can be easy to be extremely cruel and ruthless to people when my emotions are too much. That doesnt mean i shouldn't be held accountable for my actions. In fact, it is better to hold her accountable by explaining to her how that makes you feel and explaining that you do not have to accept that kind of behavior. If she is incapable of having a calm conversation about her actions and why she acts that way then get out."
BPD,fkj4o36,t3_fi06qa,1584236119.0,"I just started smoking regularly about 6 months ago. At that same time,I ended my relationship and ended my relationship with my FP. For the first time in my life, I feel like I can take on the day. I'm productive and I wake up happy. I usually only smoke in the evenings and never before I need to drive or go to work or class. I have not had a split since I started smoking."

BDSMcommunity,fhlme59,t3_f3ue3t,1581702191.0,Yes yes yes yes yes! My daddy(29M) makes me(22F) so very happy every day. For the first time I'm content and secure in my relationship. I have very terrible anxiety and he just seems to calm the storm in my head just by holding me. He is honestly the best thing that has happened to me and I dont understand how I got so lucky.
WeightLossAdvice,fe1yawa,t3_enmpo1,1578832277.0,"I avoid the scale and just try to focus on how my clothes fit and how i feel. I've been going to the gym 3 days a week for 6 months as well as switching to a diet of fewer carbs and very little sugar. I started at 330 pounds and am now at 292 pounds. My weight hasn't changed as much as I would like but ive dropped 2 pants sizes and a shirt size. I've lost 27 inches off my body. Basically what I'm saying is often times the scale is a liar. If you want to weigh, try to only weigh 1 time a week first thing in the morning after using the restroom and before eating or drinking anything. It's important to do so before consuming anything because a meal can add 5 pounds or even more to your weight."
