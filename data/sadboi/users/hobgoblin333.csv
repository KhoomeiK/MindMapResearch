Psychosis,flwvxsm,t3_frj4jx,1585567285.0,I feel this way with texts like somehow everyone can read when I’ve said to everyone and they all will use things against me later on like I’m being monitored it’s terrible

Dreams,fkfjnl5,t3_fi2g0k,1584135880.0,"LITERALLY ALL THE TIME I’m constantly dreaming of peeing yet never once have I peed ! 1. I have insane public bathroom anxiety, the shyest bladder ever I simply can not pee in public washrooms if someone else is in the room and even at friends houses I need to turn the tap on so no one can hear me pee SO I constantly have dreams I’m peeing in the middle of a very public area and thankfully I never wake up having peed myself and if I ever need to pee I’ll go to the bathroom mid dream and pee for so long then I’ll just get up and continue my dream just to realize “holy shit I still really need to pee” and this goes on and on in my dream until I wake up and actually get up to go pee it’s whack and I have crazy anxiety one day I’ll pee the bed ! I’m so glad I’m not the only one lmaooo"
