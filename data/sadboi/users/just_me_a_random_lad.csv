mentalhealth,eom4zhs,t3_bsczx7,1558681888.0,I can never control my thinking. It goes in a spiral. Until it meets the end that are suicidal thoughts I'm proud to say I haven't acted on my suicidal thoughts yet but it always hurts you laying awake thinking about killing yourself. (my view of me being depressed) or going to sleep knowing there is a chance you won't wake up and dreams repeating themselves of what if situations and other things like that.
mentalhealth,eolzgw8,t3_bs77u9,1558678972.0,"I hate schools that don't have like professional help for suicidal and depressed children and teens. Like ""hmm so your parents are neglecting you and you self harm here sign this contract saying you can't kill yourself."""

AskReddit,eoiwa8x,t1_eohz3gv,1558628614.0,"I understand you. I had a friend that copied everything I did. But instead of pretending to be as me she would down grade me. ( I have very bad depressive episodes sometimes) I would be crying my eyes out in school telling my teacher that I was never going to be able to finish school and saying that I'm worthless and that no one will care if I'm dead and when she moves me to another room to concentrate on my work my ""friend"" would come up to me telling me how she had it so much worse and that her dad had punched her sister ( he hadn't. I asked her if I should call the cops and she said it was like ten years ago. So she lied to me. Also I know he's a sweet guy and would never do that.) and how she was suicidal when she was three. She would make me feel like an idiot for looking at death as a way out(I have never acted on my thoughts on suicide). I talked about it with someone (like a child therapist but they help you grow through it and don't get payed by you. ) but she said I should invite her home talk about it. She started playing with my games and didn't spare a glance at me. I hope to leave her but I don't know if I'll be able to. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
AskReddit,eoin198,t3_brzuwa,1558623203.0,I don't know? Maybe that you don't understand until you experience it. Until you avoid your friends at all costs because you know they'll ask you if you're alright. Until you sit down crying telling yourself that you are okay. Until you fear that the people left view you as you view yourself.
