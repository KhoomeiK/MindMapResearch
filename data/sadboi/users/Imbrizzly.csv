DeadBedrooms,ffhfzan,t1_ffhfjfl,1579933624.0,"I have. He used to try but recently he's been on the ""this is the way I am"" kick and I get that's true but also I know having aspergers doesn't make you incapable of having a loving relationship. I've tried to talk to him about ways of communicating and feeling intimacy that might work with him but he says he's happier than he has ever been and doesn't want to be responsible for my happiness anymore. 
 I've been telling him for months that I would like to cuddle more or for him to hold my hand more. Itellhim I feel ugly and unwanted but it always ends up my fault.
The other night I straight up said ""I feel ugly, can we do other sexual stuff like blowjobs or hand jobs?"" And he said that would be fine. So I asked him yesterday if we could plan it for tomorrow before bed and he said that's fine too.
I'm happy he's willing to have some sort of physical connection with me but I don't know how to establish an emotional connection in the moments leading up to it. I already feel like I've failed and it's something I explicitly asked for so I can't complain when it doesn't live up to my needs"

I had a really bad sunburn when I was a teenager and now my skin bubbles up in the heat so I just tear it off. I tear off little bumps when they pop up. When I was in elementary I picked all of the skin off my nose because I was left alone too long when I got my first pimple (that turned into staph).
