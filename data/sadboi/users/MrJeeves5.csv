bipolar,fr5jf6t,t1_fr4y0z0,1589909540.0,Yeah to be fair I dont have good relations with any of my doctors. I will try switch them
bipolar,fipym3s,t1_fipyaja,1582628130.0,Sleeping is massively important and it's very hard I find so I can relate with you for its usage in relevance to sleep. I'm glad you haven't been manic since August. It's always weird cus idk about you but I love being manic but I hate the realisation after coming away from it realising what you've done
bipolar,fipyk4q,t1_fipy499,1582628056.0,Yeah I've always been anxious about its relativity to the meds as I find weed does help me alot so that's good to hear
bipolar,fipxyol,t1_fipwg4h,1582627215.0,Wax is incredible isnt it. Hard to get in my area but was defo incredible whenever I have gotten a hold of it. It never fixes it yeah but I understand what you mean
bipolar,fipxw99,t1_fiodmmu,1582627114.0,Numbing the reality seems to be common. That's what I look for too
bipolar,fipxv7n,t1_fins7h8,1582627072.0,That last paragraph of advice seems like a truly priceless and useful piece of info. I'm really thankful to hear about that view point on addiction and getting into good routines

bipolar,fipxnzo,t1_fina0pj,1582626780.0,I'm the same I also see it as the death of me. Shooting up and doing crystal meth is hard man that sounds mental. Can you easily admit yourself to rehab?
bipolar,fipxlah,t1_fin8jeq,1582626673.0,I'm glad I'm super not alone. I've had very similar addictions and experiences to you it seems. Its sortve nice to hear. Did u ever do any of those drugs while on anti psychotics?
bipolar,fipxiu1,t1_fin7jas,1582626575.0,Do you think psychiatrists are ok with substance use? Because mine doesnt seem to be bothered by the use as I smoke weed instead of doing other stuff like self harm or go out and do stupid shit
bipolar,fipxgt1,t1_fin7o5b,1582626494.0,Do you think the weed interrupts with medication at all?
depression,fipx4wu,t3_f8q6pt,1582626005.0,When I was sectioned I was in school before hand and I got sent to the psychiatric hospital straight from there. Spent a week in there and they said school was important and must go. School is just added stress so really isnt good for someone who's been in that way. I know how you feel and it's really tough to have to go to school dealing with that. I was lucky as I have bipolar the school was a bit more I guess scared of my behavioral in school so it's even worse for you as I've noticed schools dont take depression as seriously as psychotic disorders. If you need a chat or whatever I'm here to give some advice or just to listen from a position of familiarity :)

I love it! Must've been hard to even think about taking the photo as I can imagine you were so sedated and tired

bipolar,fgq8bzv,t1_fgpwi47,1581019746.0,That sounds like a really positive mindset. I guess time is the best healer too
bipolar,fgpq14r,t1_fgppjva,1581009772.0,How long did it take you to realise that love wasent done?
bipolar,fgpos1x,t1_fgpiqwb,1581009063.0,That sounds really interesting
bipolar,fgpoouc,t1_fgpfmoc,1581009012.0,Did this happen despite feeling like you'll never meet someone you love like that again?
bipolar,fgpokqu,t1_fgpcw4r,1581008949.0,It's interesting to hear from your standing too as I can imagine that is how my ex felt with myself. Do you think you'll be able to love like that again? Or evee get over the love? Or even just forget?
bipolar,fgp7ai5,t1_fgp6shc,1580998621.0,"I've struggled with addiction too and it really impacts a relationship yeah. I dont know why the health system puts people on anti depressants straight away as it made my bipolar so much worse too. I have dreams constantly too about my ex, it's so horrible because I want her back as she was good for me but shes with my good friend now and is alot happier. As you said ""I dont know if I'm meant to be loved so I just stay to myself"" is such a good way to put how I feel too. I feel your exs pain as I'm in a very similar situation to him where I've improved and messaged the girl I still love but to no avail. The way we are just makes life so hard and makes normal things like having a girlfriend so hard. Thank you for opening up to me too"
bipolar,fgp60gp,t1_fgp4tc7,1580997732.0,I've hurt people too. Its shitty. Yeah getting on your feet is a good thing. Do you ever have to try to not want someone?
bipolar,fgoxsme,t1_fgoxpyr,1580991158.0,Did it take you a while to find him?
bipolar,fgixhn7,t1_fgiawde,1580832996.0,That sounds like a really positive and manageable mindset. That'll be something I look into correcting about how I see stuff. And yeah I do often sit thinking about how it's always going to be there even when on medication. But having a different approach sounds helpful
bipolar,fgi9vlc,t3_eyjh8v,1580813226.0,This has incredibly summed up an illness that I've never been able to describe. Personifying it is the perfect way to sum it up. This post is pure poetry

tall,ewo5gy7,t1_ewljo67,1565606680.0,No. Some kids dont hit puberty or start growing till 16 but obviously you'll still be naturally growing before that. So for example from 11-16 I must have grown only 4/5 inches but that's over 5 years. So it's not like you dont grow... you just grow slowly compared to how you grow during puberty if that makes sense
tall,ewo5ad1,t1_ewnqkc1,1565606442.0,No was a pretty small kid and didn't really grow much from 12-16... was always about 5 inches smaller than everyone else. Then I went from say 5ft5 at 16 to 6ft2 at 17
