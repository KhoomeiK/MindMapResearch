The only thing that will pay your rent is a fucking relentless determination to make a change in your situation. I will never say suicide is easy because I believe it takes a lot of courage. I cant say its wrong because I think of it constantly. I believe you have enough want. Maybe for your spouse, maybe the baby, maybe for you. I have no clue how it is in Morocco, I've never left the states. However there are obviously so many people willing to try and help you."

Ask yourself, ask each other, think it over again. I know all this advice sounds like bullshit. I'm on the precipice every day. Find a way to keep going, keep each other motivated,  think about the family you will be. Life is fucking hard but having a family of your own can give you purpose, strength and enough motivation to do whatever you need to. We all have faith in you."

She had been through all of my coworkers and none of them would stick it out. Her behavior has always been erratic. There were/are many times where I dont know why/how I put up with it. However, when I know how much comfort I bring to her family, and how much she gains from one on one attention, it makes me keep going. 
Does your client live in a facility? 
Also, sometimes it is just not a good match. Approach your employer by saying you don't believe you are not the right person to fit her needs."

It doesn't bother me. If I have no plans ahead I want to get completely wasted and angry if I can't.  I hate this cycle  but feel completely useless to the rest of the days. I know I dont need to drink, but it feels like the only way to calm down. I have trazodone to help me sleep and have not tried it yet. My Dr  knows of my situation and I told him I would let him know when I am ready. I know from family experience that if an addict is not ready it will  not stick.
