offmychest,f976xvy,t1_f975vel,1575160792.0,Thank you.. I'm sorry I don't normally reach out like this but I'm just finding it hard to cope with everything right now and need some form of distraction. Sometimes I just feel so isolated.
offmychest,f974op4,t1_f974i2y,1575159261.0,"I don't think so, I don't come on this account very much. After tonight I probably wont come on again until my mood falls. I understand why people wouldn't want to talk to me when I get like this so I wouldn't blame you or anyone else for dipping out."
offmychest,f974f2u,t1_f973xdz,1575159073.0,Hey.. I'm not okay but thank you for talking. I just need to keep distracted right now. I have unmedicated mental illness and my moods get very low sometimes. It's just all getting harder.
depression,f9740te,t3_e3q4il,1575158799.0,I feel the same.. I'm deeply private about my depression and it makes it very hard to talk to people without bringing it up in some way. I just don't really speak to anyone I know now.
depression,f2j6qhp,t3_ddkjui,1570268088.0,Do you have PS4? I'd play games with you :)
depression,f2j3cqf,t3_dde466,1570266658.0,"I do this all the time, but I cringe mostly for how naive and stupid I was.

I think back to social situations where I was unaware of what was happening and I cringe when I think about what they must have thought of me and what they were doing.

Sometimes I have to physically hit my head to stop, I just can't turn it off."
depression,f2j2l5a,t1_f2j246y,1570266331.0,"We can talk on mic if you have one, if not we can just message on here and play games together.

Dying is easy, it's hard to push on and I'm not sure why we do. But it makes me feel better to play games and forget."
depression,f2j2auw,t1_f2j1trw,1570266211.0,"I feel exactly the same about not getting a return.

I gave so much to my bf and it was never, ever enough for him. I worked over full time hours while he'd sit on his ass and work from home 3 days a week. I'd do all the cleaning and shopping. I moved house for him 2 times even though it meant leaving my dying dad and knowing it would break his heart.

Everyone says I just gave to the wrong person, but everyone I meet has been like this in one way or another. I just feel like people are always just looking for what they can gain from you."
depression,f2j1vq4,t1_f2j1t5k,1570266025.0,Do you have PS4?
depression,f2j1ldx,t3_ddkpst,1570265904.0,"I agree life is a curse, I'm struggling to understand why anyone finds it a gift.

I don't want you to die though, something ingrained in human behaviour I guess. Please don't do this.

I'll talk to you all day if you want, if you're in the UK I'll even give you my number."
offmychest,f2bla2r,t1_f2bk7in,1570127924.0,"Too tired, I've lost too much. It's nice you try to help people (probably because you're young) but you'll grow out of that when you see what people are really like."
offmychest,f2bjrul,t1_f2bikbr,1570127358.0,"I'm a bad person, that's why bad things happen to me. What you give out into to the world will return to you much stronger.

Life has no meaning, none of us know why we're here and most are okay with that. Some (like me) feel the urge to self destruct. Probably because I shouldn't have been brought here in the first place."
offmychest,f2bjbjk,t1_f2bivk6,1570127188.0,You're in the right place for your sadness fix.
offmychest,f0ywpqu,t1_f0ta3jb,1569080549.0,"I was in the shower and all of a sudden all the lights went out, the water went cold and my speaker playing music shut off. So everything went from normal to terrifying really quick.

I tried to fix the problem but it turned out to be more complex than I thought and it was so late I couldn't call my landlord and get i fixed until the morning. And it happened on a Monday night so I'd have to call into work and tell them that I'd have to have to day off to wait for my landlord and the thought of being without power and having to call into work just pushed me over the edge.

I'm only able to function if everything is okay at the moment."
