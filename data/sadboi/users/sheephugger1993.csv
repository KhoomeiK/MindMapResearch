Scotland,ezqastg,t1_ezqab0g,1568056882.0,Not an english teacher so apologies for that ;) If you think Education is successful right now then go into any school and observe any staff room discussion at lunchtimes for a week and your opinion will be changed.
Scotland,ezq2jhp,t1_ezpkaed,1568053911.0,Just as an opposite opinion... I am a teacher in Scotland and education is failing our kids in a masssive way in my mine and alot of peoples opinions and the SNP Government isn't helping much. Workload is insane and it causes standard of teaching to drop. Budget cuts are sqeezing any life out of teaching (we couldn't afford new textbooks for the completely updated courses that were changed a couple of years ago so we have to teach around the differences). While its not all SNPs fault (and im pro indy) the current curriculum has many many flaws
