AskWomen,fnfkavk,t3_g1a2uw,1586909721.0,"I go to therapy once a week now. I had depression  that lead to two failed suicide attempts. I was abused in my childhood and in a few horrible relationships. I learned a lot about myself. I learned what my triggers were and started to recognize what the patterns of abuse were. I thought I only had depression, but I was also diagnosed with BPD. Now I am on medication and feeling so much better. The end goal is to learn how to cope without the medication, but being on them makes me feel like I finally have control over my emotions."

But after watching Diane’s journey I figured it can’t be worse than how I feel now. I start my medication tomorrow.

depression,fdke7a3,t3_elqwy9,1578501984.0,I’m not sure why I have depression. I think I’ve always had it but when I needed help when I was young I was often told I was just “doing it for attention” or because “you’re a girl” or “you’re just a teen you will grow out of it.” Now I’m 29 and was diagnosed with BPD and I get depression episodes along with anger episodes and even happy episodes. It’s exhausting to say the least. But I’m in therapy and about to try medication soon. So hopefully I’m on the right track.

TooAfraidToAsk,fbs0f0z,t3_ee5eey,1577048555.0,I have used it a couple of times now. I’m off my meds at the moment so I’ve had a few episodes. I never call. I only do text or IM through my laptop. Both times I was talk down and had good experiences however I have to say I was probably at a 8 out of 10 as far as my unstable mindset. And the first time I did it I had ended the conversation early because they tried to get the police involved. So I can’t speak for others but that was my experience with it.

AskWomen,fbf581a,t3_ecxyyl,1576801870.0,I was probably in middle school. I “developed” a little faster than the average girl my age and while at church this creepy guy kept looking at me. Never said anything but would smirk at me and did a obvious eye check up and down my body when I would catch him looking at me. Creepy as hell

BPD,fb61ad3,t3_ebhx8a,1576538902.0,I can’t stand people like this. I later found out in therapy that it was one of my triggers for an episode so I had to cut off a bunch of my friends. Which now that I’m thinking about it were never really my friends to begin with so not so bad I guess.
dating_advice,fb4wtfc,t3_ebdwxw,1576516879.0,I think it depends on the girl. I haven’t had a guy ask me before however I do try and make it as obvious as possible if I’m interested or not. That being said if a guy did as me it wouldn’t bother me at all.

BPD,fa8ht4t,t3_e7zw34,1575846560.0,Though I’m aware that it is a form of codependency OP your post comes across as insensitive to me which is where I think the push back is coming from. I could be wrong of course but it’s how I took it. For example one of my symptoms is mania depression. I would describe it to my psychiatrist as angry depression but I know that’s not it’s actual name. I think most people in this community know that it’s a codependency and FP is not a medical term. Do some people abuse it? Absolutely. Nobody is perfect. But not all FP relationships are. And that’s important to remember too.
depression,fa15zm2,t3_e7fli7,1575765038.0,I absolutely hate people like this. Gatekeeping any kind of suffering is not ok. These are normally the same people who tell you “just stop being depressed” it’s like wtf! I had to cut an ex friend out of my life because he kept doing shit like this.

But something my therapist pointed out is that I always assume something bad will happen. But instead try remembering times when things went well instead. I won't lie it helps sometimes but not all the time. Might be worth trying out in a pinch OP.
