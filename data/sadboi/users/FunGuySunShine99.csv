In relation to that point one might pose an alternative in the hypothetical situation. 

It would seemingly not be unethical to reveal the information one does have about hitler's unethical, or at least potentially extremely unethical doings, (even if for no other reason that that he is a person who possess non consensual authority over others) but that it should stop there rather than accuse him of unethical conduct. And then pose that the people you inform have an ethical obligation to take reasonable means to interrupt hitler's ""potentially unethical conduct,"" even if only for the sake of prudence, circumspection, or for some other trait that is necessary to possess to at least some degree in order to live in a community.

So they say
1) It is unethical to accuse another of an unethical intention without material evidence or first hand knowledge.
2) It is not unethical to reveal the potentially unethical intentions which one has reason to suspect of a person who wields non consensual authority over others.
3) It is preferable to do so, but not obligatory.
4) Those who are informed have an ethical obligation to take reasonable means to prevent such individuals from committing gravely unethical acts, and developing the means necessary to do so.

If someone posed that position while claiming the one you posed was mistaken, how would you respond?"

AskMen,fpc0mhk,t1_fpb1vfw,1588483894.0,"Bruh, I was taken a walk through my favorite forested state park. I caught up to and passed 2 families walking their umpteen kids. Said hello, and all that. Then their 6 y/o copper top took a liking to me. Rode beside me on his new and first bike (which he was thrilled to talk to a ""big kid"" about. 23) I think it's cute but then he keeps at it. I try to out pace him but he just keeps up. I have officially lost the family and keep telling the kid ""they'll worry about you if you don't head back."" But of course he can't hear me over his ramblings about dinosaurs. I check over my shoulder to see the dad, out of breath and just clearing a corner with an angry look on his face. I say screw it and just take a hard out by swinging a 90 degree straight into the woods. I stumble through a marsh with tics and eventually find a trail. I reach the exit, beeline it straight to my car, then I notice the family in the parking lot. The kid rushes over to me. I flat out ignore him and put my hands behind my head so that no one thinks I'm touching him. I glance over at the obese foursome chatting between their suvs, and one of the moms is standing arms akimbo scowling at me. Smh. That was last week.

Just before winter I was leaving a store that exits to the sidewalk and then the busiest street in town. A 3 y/o-ish boy runs out of the door behind me. Thinking fast I yell at the clerk to get his mom. He's running into the street, but I'd take getting hit by a car before touching a toddler in this day and age. I clap my hands hard, hollar at him to go inside, and he, stunned by the volume, stops running into moving traffic and looks at me. I pivot 3 times each between yelling at the clerk to get his mom, and telling him gently to go inside. His mom rushes out, feigning responsibility, picks him up, gives me the dirtiest look I've gotten all year, and stomps inside.

In my Grandparent's day of you saved a child's life from parental neglect you could give the parent a dressing down in public and they'd take it because they knew they botched one of their only jobs & that they should have their kids taken away. Nowadays you don't get to do that, you don't even get to go on your merry way, you get accused of being an pedophile and the cops called on you. It's a sick world."

I think this is a much more healthy model of dating and encourages date requests by removing anxiety. America used to have a more casual attitude towards this as well. Of course I fault no one for having predetermined deal breakers. No law against having standards. I merely think that allowing someone to buy you an ice cream for an hour shouldn't require that they meet every item on a person's standards list preemptively. 

I once dated a ranch girl who rode bulls at rodeos. I normally would have felt insecure about that, and probably would have said no, but I did anyways, and we really hit it off.

Additionally, adequate wealth can be reasonably preserved via best practices which are contained in books. Why should a wealthy friend need to compensate a poorer friend who is burgled once per year simply because the poor friend refuses to move away from his crime ridden neighborhood? Why would a gift of a couple hundred dollars worth of books about how to build, preserve, grow, and insure wealth not be a reasonable alternative to the system you pose, which arguably incentivizes the neglecting of these best practices?"

1. Why was A not insured.
2. Had the friends discussed these sorts of situations prior?
3. How can B be certain that A did his due diligence?
4. Why is B capable but not C? Did C neglect the accumulation of wealth while B worked hard?
5. What are the underpinning philosophical and religious beliefs of that society? If they oppose C's beliefs has C addressed these publicly beforehand? If not, does C expect everyone to immediately begin altering their tried and established customs at the potential risk of their societal stability? 
6. Has C done his due diligence about inquiring into these issues?
7. Did A do his due diligence with home security?
8. Is C hypocrite for not extending even a meager token offering to A while expecting B to offer perhaps a similar sum relative to his gross annual income?
9. Has C addressed this matter with B?
10. Was A overpowered in combat by a thief in their society which does not allow for weapons of defense? And was C at least complicit in this policy? If C believes in this policy has he at least familiarized himself with the statistics & arguments so as to be able to critically evaluate his position?
11. Is B doing other things of benefit such as reducing crime as the mayor of the city / contributing to a neighborhood watch?
12. Does C do anything to help others or is he just a reactionary?
13. What of D-Z (friends / family / neighbors / orphans)? Is B somehow obligated, but not morally obligated, to all of them as well? To what extent? What is the equation that factors in relationship, wealth, and circumstance that explains this matter? Is it agreed upon? 
14. Has B already contributed by paying higher taxes for policing the environment which has seen a decrease in burglary since years past, arguably having already prevented prior thefts against A? 
15. And on and on and on...

""Agitation is an invitation to examination.""
If C is angry at B, he would do well to take counsel before acting on his anger.

""When in doubt do without."" 
Righteous indignation at the theft, is seemingly, well ordered, but with merely the info given, anger at B appears to be ill advised and in need of examination.

""Attribute to ignorance that which can not be assuredly attributed to malice."" 
The anger against B is at the very least, not yet justified. 


But also, is not B telling C indirectly by his inaction that should hardship befall C, B's friendship doesn't benefit C financially? Doesn't this seem cruel given that C believes he would help B financially should the situations switch? But was any of this ever agreed upon or even discussed? Is C guilty of presumption? Is the friendship a fine a good thing, but not in the realm of minor emergency financial aid? What is friendship? How do we define it? Should we address such issues? How?

TooAfraidToAsk,fn2gzgw,t3_fygw11,1586588665.0,I joined a monastery for 10 weeks in the winter of 2013. They turned out their lights with the sunset and walked barefoot everywhere. I still struggle to bring myself to turn the lights on at night.
unpopularopinion,fmylv4d,t3_fy1il4,1586489342.0,If the choosy gender gets to have height standards is hypocritical to be upset with men for similarly having physical standards.
socialskills,fmy0ak7,t3_fxoc97,1586475427.0,"Yeah, don't sweat it too much. As a kid my parents kept me doped up on amphetamines, in my room, in front of a TV for years. School socializing didn't help. I was 23 before I found out about Dale Carnegie's books & others. Things blew up for me in a big way. It was weird for the first few months. I was almost like a psychopath. Socially oblivious, mentally flipping through my new social resource manual, trying to find the right thing to say that wouldn't sink the conversation. I was definitely the creepy weird guy who didn't have a clue socially and suffered every day because of it. Now my weirdness, which I don't know how to shed, nor do I care to, has become a charming sort of quirk. It's actually not that hard because the best ""socialized"" people around only have experience knowledge, which in this case, to my view, is inferior to learned knowledge. For 23 years, I was a social failure. Honestly, if you put a gun to my head and offered me a million dollar prize I would not have been able to make a friend, get a date, or carry an easy flowing conversation for even 10 minutes. 1 year after listening to audio books and YouTube videos for 3 hours / day, for 4 months, I don't even recognize the person I used to be. If you apply yourself to at least casual study, and test your new skills every day on people around you, you'll be more socially competent than the most popular people around. Any residual weirdness will be little more a distraction than a birthmark at worst, and an intriguing personality compliment at best.

So best of luck stranger.
Peace"

intj,fmxdgf0,t3_fxwcdj,1586462933.0,"I feel ya. The average age for reddit users does exclude the more seasoned members of society, and the average age of interest in mbti is teens and twenties. So you'll end up with a lot of the younger crowd. Additionally, there's a lot of hype around intjs having latent genius and super cool secrets of understanding that no one else gets. Throw in the discomfort this causes older intjs, and the boldness of speech that anonymity provides, and you've got yourself a recipe for a very juvenile sub. Pros and cons follow with more energy and humor, but less sophistication and reservation."
