veganfitness,fqh4qsy,t3_gipqt7,1589367740.0,"Vivo Life has my favorite protein powder of all time. Great taste and really clean ingredients! 
Like others have mentioned, there are tons of great plant based yogurts out there, and you can up the protein by adding things like nuts/seeds, high protein granola, powdered pb, protein powder, etc.
Another fun option for a high protein snack or dessert is to make a pudding using silken tofu sweetened with dates (or maple syrup) and cocoa powder, or really any flavors you like. Sounds weird, tastes bomb!"
aww,fpwy6gl,t3_gfxeew,1588972128.0,So sick of pet shop posts on this sub..
childfree,fpk1h38,t1_fpjs0b2,1588686059.0,About to turn 30...more sure than ever!
vegan,fo4gx8l,t3_g52ii0,1587504212.0,Oh how I’ve missed pretzels in quarantine! I’ll have to give these a try. And right in time as I just made way too much vegan queso! Thanks for the inspo :)
Anxiety,fnhpo0k,t1_fngxgbp,1586966675.0,"Totally get it. My brain is the same sometimes. I’m using this quarantine to teach myself how to chill and just do nothing sometimes, because sometimes that’s all we need. Weed helps haha. Just remind yourself that you deserve to relax :) 
Best of luck to you!"
Anxiety,fn9qsgz,t3_g0h7l6,1586782158.0,"I totally understand that feeling, I get it too. But don’t let social media fool you- you’re just seeing the highlight reel. Most people really aren’t doing all that much. 
But if you want to, you could try to incorporate a few healthy habits by starting really small- something you can do every day fairly easily. Like creating a morning routine where you stretch or meditate for a few minutes, or start your day with a 30 min walk. Then as you go you can incorporate even more. 
Don’t beat yourself up. These are tough times, and you’re doing your best :)"
Anxiety,fmzpypq,t3_fyerdf,1586527023.0,"I haven’t really fully cut anything out, but I’ve significantly reduced social media usage, turned off notifications for all my apps, keep caffeine low, and reallyyyy reduced my alcohol consumption in the last few weeks. The alcohol has probably made the biggest difference for me."
ShittyVeganFoodPorn,fms6eax,t3_fww0gz,1586347970.0,"I’m so sorry! That sounds awful. My husband and I almost separated a few weeks ago...would’ve ended up quarantined together while trying to get divorced. Instead we get to talk through all our issues while isolating in our very small apartment together...
I hope those nuggets helped though!"
vegan,fmoq8oq,t3_fwkcfb,1586266097.0,"Ughhh I hate that. My buddy gets all confused every time I say he’s not vegan, he just eats a plant based diet. It’s. Not. The. Same."
Anxiety,fmc3bx2,t3_fubo2u,1585938120.0,"Hi there. I know how hard (or impossible) it can be to pull yourself out of an anxiety spiral, so I hope you’re able to take a few deep breaths and feel a little bit of peace. 
From personal experience with anxiety, it usually helps to just talk about it- don’t keep it bottled in. Especially something so big like this. Talk to your wife; you shouldn’t have to go through these feelings alone, and I’m sure that she’ll appreciate your honestly. 
But I hope you are also able to be honest with yourself about whether this is what you want. My husband and I are childfree by choice, so I understand the panic that pregnancy can cause- I would be losing my mind, especially during such difficult times. 

Anyway, I’m so sorry you are struggling with this news. Best of luck to you."
Anxiety,fl5dvgk,t3_fmk4hm,1584834433.0,Yo I feel you. Stay strong ♥️

Anxiety,fi3v4br,t3_f69tqo,1582128294.0,"Yes! I always say that I feel like I’m next to my body, but not really in it. No one ever gets it. It’s unsettling isn’t it?"
Anxiety,fhis1h8,t3_f3gub3,1581630687.0,"This helps me too :) Sam Harris has talked about this idea also from a neuroscience perspective. The idea of rewriting our brain is super interesting, and can be really effective."
Anxiety,fhbsp0t,t3_f2d9is,1581449061.0,"I’m so sorry. You’re not alone. Just keep breathing...I always find it helps to remind myself that whatever I’m feeling is fleeting, and it will pass. You will feel better eventually. Sending so much love and support ♥️"
Anxiety,fhblg08,t3_f29e98,1581444702.0,"It worked really well for me! It got me through starting a new job with zero anxiety attacks :) I’d still be using it if it weren’t so expensive. Every brand is different though, and some work better than others. I used Nuleaf and swear by it. But of course everyone’s different so it’s hard to say if it would have the same impact for you. I’d say worth a shot though!"
vegan,fhb3plb,t3_f26dde,1581434101.0,"I totally get the guilt, I felt it in the beginning too. But you’re making the right choice now and that’s what matters! We’ve all been there- unfortunately we just didn’t know better. What matters is what you do once you do know better. You both are making such an immensely positive change, and that’s something to be proud of! The guilt will fade as pride and passion and love take its place. Welcome to the community! 🥰"
vegan,fh2zqtn,t1_fh2yaln,1581262965.0,Ooo I’ve been meaning to try there...thanks!
vegan,fh2z66t,t1_fh2g1ic,1581262764.0,Good point! And the flavor usually comes from herbs and spices anyway 💁‍♀️
vegancirclejerk,fh2yq76,t3_f16wqj,1581262611.0,"Is the implication here that, because we are humans, we should be eating...humans?! 😂"
vegan,fh1snjt,t1_fh1rd50,1581223020.0,"Cause it’s not the flavor we’re opposed to 🤷‍♀️ just the cruelty. So if we can replicate the flavor without the suffering, seems like a pretty big win."
vegan,fh1se3e,t1_fh1nfur,1581222803.0,Yeah as a Baltimore dweller I’d love to know where also! 😍

veganfitness,fdrm6ny,t3_ekih2u,1578686433.0,"I use Vivo Life, and loooove them. I’ll never use another protein powder. I don’t know if they have a plain flavor, but the vanilla is fairly neutral, and none of the flavors are sweet/they don’t add any sugar. Plus it’s an amazing vegan company, and they’re switching to compostable packaging. Can’t recommend them enough!"
