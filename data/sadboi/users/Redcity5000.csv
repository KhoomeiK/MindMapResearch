BPD,fn0l7py,t3_fyh7we,1586543989.0,"That's why social media is so toxic for pretty much everyone, some worse than others of course. It allows anyone to portray their life as perfect whether that be in regards to relationships or success, but in reality the majority of people behind the screen posing this way are themselves unhappy or depressed, their relationships might seem happy but who knows what's going on behind the scenes. Sure there are some benefits to social media but the negatives far outweigh them, it's making people sick and is no way beneficial for anyone let alone ones dealing with mental illness. Everyone do yourselves a favour and leave it alone, you'll feel much more liberated knowing your emotions  aren't being manipulated by the life of others. Live your own life, focus on yourself and the people around you! A private, happy life is the way to success, I personally don't see any fruitfulness to be gained from sharing your memories and the goings on in your private life with the world."
