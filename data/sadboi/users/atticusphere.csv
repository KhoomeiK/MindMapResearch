TalesFromTheCustomer,fqmt9wf,t3_gjlc96,1589483156.0,"these drivers are so ready to argue rather than try to understand that a mistake may have been made, or their software glitched. 

quite often my address gets mixed up with our next door neighbor (who are also my in-laws) so my food will go to them, and their food will come to us. it’s a software glitch that happens sporadically with most of the food delivery services, because my house sits on what was originally intended to be a road. so the gps wigs out, yay technology. however, we don’t really feel the need to tell each other “hey, we’re ordering food, so if it goes to your door just send them over” lol, so when the system glitches and fills in the wrong address, the driver comes to the wrong door, and will legit argue “well it’s the address on the order” no matter how many times i say or they say that we didn’t order it.

apparently calling the customer is far too difficult, they’d rather argue every single time, no matter the driver. i don’t understand why, either; especially because i’ve been a delivery driver myself for numerous companies in the past, and would never have argued with someone that way. “oh, wrong address? my apologies, there must’ve been a miscommunication. i’ll get this taken care of. thanks for your time, and i apologize for any inconvenience!”

edit for clarity: we never know the system glitched to the incorrect address until the delivery driver calls us. after spending however much time arguing with the other party."

todayilearned,fq6h73x,t1_fq66z3m,1589131456.0,"i took a survey of mathematics class last fall, they went really in depth with this. 

you’re essentially correct, especially in that they didn’t have a symbol for zero until later on. but even that symbol was just a place marker - it wasn’t widely used, and wasn’t typically to the right of the number like we see with 10. they understood the concept of nothingness, which eventually brought about that symbol, but they didn’t ever really conceptualize zero like a lot of other cultures did. it was seen as an absence of a number rather than a number in itself. 

most of their numerology was context-based, and the numbers could be seen as whole, as equations, or as fractions. for example, <<VVV could be seen as 23, 23x60, or 23/60, depending on the context in which it was written. 

it’s surmised that they used base 60 because of the prime factorization. honestly, though, no one knows. it’s one of those mysteries of mathematics."
