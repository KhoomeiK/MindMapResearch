InteriorDesign,fqp3cge,t1_fo6sqd4,1589533544.0,Hi! I’d love to get your opinion on color scheme and taking the pieces I have now and helping me pull it all together. Are you taking on new clients? Ty
InteriorDesign,fqp3869,t1_fo7dlkw,1589533421.0,I emailed you! Ty
JustNoTruth,fqh5clg,t3_gimq6s,1589368301.0,I agree but I think it’s “BEC” behavior.. like the behavior itself of using “my grand baby” or buying baby items. It’s more so about hating that person so literally anything they do would annoy you at that point. I also think it’s rooted in control
DesignMyRoom,fqd5q70,t1_fqcfq43,1589280663.0,"Yes it’s my husband and I trying to agree on what to keep. What would you replace the items you mentioned? My husband wants to keep the black chair and the American flag. (I would love to get ride of them and the bar cart but I’m trying to work with him) 

I’ve added a plant to left side, ordered an ivory area rug and light gray sectional. 

Nothing feels put together or like it goes but I’m not sure exactly what to take away and/or replace it with to make it flow better."
JUSTNOMIL,fq63ge5,t1_fq61zz4,1589123702.0,"Thank you. Yes my fertility place has mental health resources I’ve reached out to. 

My husband doesn’t want to do counseling. He kinda just wants to sweep it under the rug and try to ignore the awkwardness around the situation. 

I appreciate your support and will take your advice to heart 💕"
JUSTNOMIL,fq610ws,t1_fq60c7l,1589122221.0,"That’s exactly in my head how I imagine/day dream I wish I had responded.  Do you ever worry they are turning you into the “just no” 

My DH has suggested tho that you don’t have to “beat a dead horse” and I tend to overly make my point. I don’t want to beat her down I just want to feel respected. I’m always on my toes- I’m worried I’m too on my toes and being a bitch. 

Thank you for your response!"
JUSTNOMIL,fq5z02e,t1_fq5s6ur,1589120951.0,Ty. The fertility issue kind of became the hill to die on for me. She did not expect me to address her asking behind my back to DH. Since then it’s been super awkward with her being veeeery polite it’s like I feel like a huge bitch.
JUSTNOMIL,fq5yuug,t1_fq5sdtu,1589120857.0,"Yea but I also have been rude to her so I give her ammo. How would you suggest getting out of this pettiness? I’m having a hard time brushing everything off but the “directly addressing” things approach isn’t going well either. 

I’m kinda just like giving myself a time out and reflecting."
JUSTNOMIL,fq5yn3x,t1_fq5stv8,1589120718.0,"Thank you for your thoughtful response. The term malicious compliance is helpful and I think we’ve both been guilty of this as well as passive aggressive- although I err more on the aggressive side. 

The fertility issue was very gray and I was wishy washy on my boundaries because 1. I thought we’d get pregnant quick and it wouldn’t be a long drawn out process that it has become 2. I did want to include her but at my pace and on my time not be asked updates (this might be a little controlling on my part but I felt my fertility was an area I could be full controlling on) I think I should be in control but I could’ve been more clear. 

I’m currently feeling like an asshole and silently sulking about it. I’m in a daily group text thread that goes off 10-15 times a day. Since the fertility drama I haven’t texted in 3-4 months. I’m feeling like the black sheep but I’m not sure how to proceed. I’m stepping back so I don’t lash out but it’s hard to just let go and try to be warm again. 

I feel stuck."
JUSTNOMIL,fq5xpm3,t1_fq5vm2m,1589120106.0,"Thank you! I really appreciate this perspective because it’s hard to see yourself from an objective opinion. 

The comments in the car started because she was giving unsolicited “I’m the cool MIL” advice on don’t let anyone guilt trip you- invite who you want and fuck other people’s opinions. I guess she didn’t mean her. Looking back I think I’ve been tactless with her and although it was all “joking” I think I was rude. 

The last paragraph is so weird to hear you say that because I feel like the cake analogy is how I feel but I never thought she feels the same way. Like she told me to tell her when she does something but I think I’ve went overboard and I took that and rubbed her face in it. 

I think outside of these problems she is a nice woman and is a good mom to my DH. She does manipulate and gossip but I’m not sure if it arises to Justno. I go back and forth on is she a just no? Is she a just maybe or is she a just yes and am I the Justno? 

I thought telling her some info would help ease the situation “look I’m including you” but then I don’t know how to close that door back up- I want that door ajar but not closed or open. Like I want you to know some but not all. I don’t blame her for feeling like wtf where’s the boundary because I’m new to this too. I’m feeling like I’m being too controlling or rude. 

I guess I should just be more firm with not sharing some info if I’m not willing to share more- it’s natural curiosity to ask for follow ups but in my blood family they understood and didn’t get super weird on me. But they’ve also known me longer and can read me better. 

Thank you for your perspective. I’m really struggling and I think because my ivf journey has not been successful and has been a lot longer than expected I may have some misplaced anger and resentment playing into this. 

I’m trying to do better with being kinder to my MIL but not be a doormat either and enforcing boundaries."
JustNoTruth,fq5rdxl,t1_fq4b4ck,1589115357.0,This comment really hit me.  I love this sub because I feel like these little nuggets of advice are what I need. I go to jnmil looking for this type of comment and support. Not all OPs are perfect and not all jnMIL are evil. I know this sub is not for giving advice but I read the posts looking for comments like this one. Keep posting because DILs are lurking and reading. Thank you
JUSTNOMIL,fq5qtxo,t1_fq5ompw,1589114899.0,"This has been helpful. Ty! I read the article and I think the thing that sticks with me and makes me question myself is that I have been known to be a little harsh. In other relationships I tend to hold grudges and keep things inside and then be a bit harsh in my responses. I felt like I was addressing things early to avoid that but I have held a grudge and trying to self reflect a bit on how to build a better relationship with boundaries but also being warm and nice. 

I feel like I have to choose between being assertive and having a guarded relationship or passive and hating myself and her.  I just want a nice balance!"
JUSTNOMIL,fo6ezq2,t3_g5vomm,1587556888.0,"I have it muted and comment once every month or so but honestly even that is a “thing” but only something they talk about behind my back so I leave it alone.

IVF,fmtdnq0,t1_fmtcam5,1586370967.0,"Yes- he changed to clomid after the first and he adjust the medication. When I ask about uterus issues he was just honest and said he’s not going to poke around down there too much because the solutions are surgical and he thinks I’ve had too many and doesn’t want to give more scar tissue. 

When I bring up other ideas like I heard pomegranate, acupuncture or other vitamins he basically says he’s not recommending them because the science isn’t there but isn’t discouraging me. 

He said if our state wasn’t ny he’d want to try a surrogate but he also said he’s not giving up and seems confident to keep doing the transfers so idk 

I’m at the point now where after this last transfer should I go to another RE for the next egg retrieval or stick it out with this guy? He’s my 2nd RE and I like him but am I insane for not trying a new RE? It’s RMA of ny if it matters. I’m happy with him and the facility minus the no baby thing 😭😭"

IVF,fmst7hp,t1_fmsi1tk,1586361626.0,"The specialist told me on my 4th and final surgery that he cleared a lot from my endometriosis- I was a symptomatic but he said with the septum you usually have it. When I brought this up to current RE he said even if I have it he would not recommend a surgery to remove it because he thinks I’ve already had too many surgeries and he doesn’t want to do anything. 

When I’ve done progesterone for the transfers they take blood and say I’m absorbing it well. Are there other ways to know if I’m resistant? If they test my blood and say it’s absorbing is there other tests I should ask for? 

Lining isn’t great- only gets up to 7mm. He gave me more estrace. Trying pomegranate juice can’t get over 7mm each transfer. RE said there’s not much you can do for lining 

Immune implantation dysfunction- how do I get tested for this and what can I do to assess/address it? 

Maternal tolerance- no clue what that means either. Can you elaborate on what I should be asking for?

personalfinance,fen5eju,t1_femv23m,1579277356.0,"We are currently spending $1750 on rent and putting $1000 in our savings for the down payment. The broker said our mortgage payments would be $2300. So we figured we the rent we would be paying plus the $1000 we had been saving towards the down payment would cover the monthly mortgage payment ($2300) with $450 to either save for home repairs or to put towards paying off the retirement loan if we do take it out.

Mildlynomil,f4c6npg,t3_dk4fzm,1571524822.0,I’m 2 years married to a man who is similar. He doesn’t actively say no or disagree but he does it in subtle ways. I feel like it’s manageable for me because I communicate my feelings to him and he supports me. If he made excuses or didn’t show me ways he sets boundaries I think I’d have a different opinion.

inlaws,f2y28rk,t1_f2wnt6f,1570485298.0,"We’ve recently been having fertility issues and they want more regular updates than I feel comfortable giving. I feel like fertility is the kinda thing u wait for updates- like who asks? They do. So I’ve asked them to please wait for us to provide updates because it’s super sensitive and private to me. We’re doing ivf and the parents told him and I we should tell SIL we are doing ivf too. To me fertility updates should be given not asked for. Also I don’t see how a SIL should be included in the ivf convo unless it’s successful.

I did try the second thing- I said “I love my mom but (turning to DH) would you want to commit to a weekly dinner with my mom?” that’s when he looked at his pasta. Later he said although he didn’t think I was rude, but I was too direct. He would’ve just smiled and nodded but not done the weekly dinners. I take things literally and am direct.
