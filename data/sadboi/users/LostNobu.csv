SuicideWatch,fpiu6wv,t3_g5ejp3,1588648807.0,"Literally had that keep happening when my dad died. Everyone loved saying ""I'm always here if you need me"" And when I try to take them up on the offer, they respond like that, tell me just ""you need help"", and literally push you away. 
People say it so if you kill yourself they have that pat on the back of "" But I just don't know why they didn't talk to me? I offered a hand!!"" To make themselves look good."
SuicideWatch,fpiniqw,t3_gdoamo,1588644622.0,I suffer from BPD too. It ruins almost everything and I can't control it. I really hope you're okay and you can always message me if you need anything.
