She hugged me so tight and cried, and she told me that I'm strong and amazing and that what happened to me doesn't make me dirty or ruined or less than, that by surviving and being here today and having the courage to talk to her is proof that I'm so strong and courageous. She told me that things will be hard but that it does get better, that weeks can go by where she doesn't think about what happened to her, that she's happily married with two kids and that I can do anything I want in life if I work hard. She said that I can use what happened to me for the better, and that she's going to keep an eye out and can't wait to see me as a bestselling author or winning the nobel peace prize. She talked to me for so long, and she didn't even care that I was crying like a baby and getting snot and tears all over her fancy shirt. Ugh just thinking about it I'm getting emotional.

CPTSD,fl6pclk,t3_fmxaki,1584878837.0,"This happens to me a lot too, but it doesn't necessarily mean you're having nightmares, though you could be. I rarely remember my dreams either, but most of the time it's because I'm not sleeping deeply enough to dream - I think that might be what's happening to you. 

With PTSD but especially with CPTSD, our stress response systems are always activated. This means we're always on-edge, alert, ready to run at any sign of danger. This means anxiety, tense muscles, rapid heart rate and blood pressure, clenching jaws and fists. If our bodies are trying to stay aware of danger, it means that you're sleeping so lightly that you would be able to tell if something around you was happening. This is why you're fluctuating in and out of sleep - people usually go through several sleep cycles ([stage 1-4](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Understanding-Sleep)), but for us, because our cycles are levels lighter than what they should be, if you never make it past stage 2 or 3 into REM sleep, then when you should be cycling out of REM and into a lighter stage of sleep, there's no where for our bodies to go but all the way awake because the deepest we ever get is stage 2 or 3. Or, if a bird flies by your window it could be enough to wake you up because your stress response is so activated. 

So it doesn't necessarily mean you're having nightmares, it could just be your stress response waking you up and making you tense. I find it helpful to do 'body scans' so I can be more aware of the tension I'm holding in my body and consciously force myself to relax. I end up in a lot of pain from tensing my muscles and grinding my teeth so I really sympathize."

There should be an FBI agent on her case, I assume? Or at least a member of CAC/ICAC? She should ask the FBI agent to connect her with a victim advocate who can connect her to resources and support services. 

There are also national organizations that can provide ground-level support and help her find local services and charities to connect her to:

Child services are most likely already involved, but do basically nothing to help. I'd recommend checking out the local Child Advocacy Center and/or Family Justice Center directly instead of wasting your time with CPS. They can help get her in contact with charities and provide services, and even help get her connected to public benefits if necessary/applicable. 

I wouldn't recommend starting with a rape crisis center because they can often be finicky about dealing with people who are under 18 and if it's not one of the good ones, it'll do more harm than good - trust me. Make sure you get a good referral before checking out a rape crisis center. 

[RAINN](https://rainn.org/) can help her find local organizations (including FJC's) and has a hotline and web chat for support. 

[NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/) has many resources for victims of child porn and trafficking and their families. 

The [National Human Trafficking Hotline](https://humantraffickinghotline.org/) can also provide emergency support services and help her locate local charities that can specifically help with the exploitation aspect of the abuse. 

The [Trafficking Victims Protection Act](https://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/human-trafficking-an-overview-of-services-and-funding-for-survivors.aspx) (TVPA) ensured that all states receive funding for survivors of human trafficking and adequate funding for related support systems. I'm not sure how it works in Texas, but for me in New York, I had to apply through OTDA who then referred me to OVS, and once approved, OVS covers ALL trafficking-related expenses for the rest of my life. They'll pay for my therapy, they'll reimburse me retroactively for medical bills resulting from injuries I sustained from my abuse and pay for any and all related medical costs in the future, they offered to help me afford a downpayment on an apartment to help me move out of my dad's house, my therapist says they could even give me money to buy myself shoes and a jacket for winter. 

The [Amy, Vicky, and Andy Act](https://childvictims.us/) means that she and her sister can receive restitution from every single person who is caught with her videos, including her dad and anyone else who saw or possessed them if her dad shared them around. It also assures protections and support throughout the legal process. 

OVS funding is her best option. Please look into this and see if there's some form of this in Texas, if you PM me I can help you look as well. I know pretty much every trafficking organization in the country and can also ask the FBI agent on my case or one of the social workers at the charity I receive services at, so *please* PM me if you'd like me to help you find more specific resources, if you have any other questions, or if you think your girlfriend would be interested in speaking with someone who understands. Wishing you both the best."

And yeah I don't want to tell the teacher about this, I don't trust her at all. I've just given up at this point since I don't actually care about the stupid yearbook, it just hurts that I can't be normal."
