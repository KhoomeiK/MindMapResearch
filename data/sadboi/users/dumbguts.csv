>>!""In the next episode, a tear-strewn Chloe reads a letter to the band explaining that she’s leaving them. In the aftermath of that emotional moment, we really see the insidiousness of the bullying take shape. The remaining girls are angry at Chloe for her exit, insisting that the way she left the band was ""unprofessional"", especially because she didn’t let them know how she’d felt prior. You can maybe accept that Gabi and Debbie had the rug pulled out from under them, though not Georgia, who immediately falls to the floor in dumbfounded tears after Chloe says she’s out. Georgia later suggests she was just being forthright in her criticism, as if you can’t be wrong if you’re just being honest. This is classic bully justification: equating the damage they’d wrought with the victim not saying how hurt they were. It puts the victim in a position where they have to set the boundary of human decency, when the obligation should really be on others to understand how their actions might be hurtful. The band eventually reconciles, and Georgia does apologise to Chloe in the final scene of the series. Still, Chloe shouldn’t have been made to feel bad for wanting to escape a toxic environment.
