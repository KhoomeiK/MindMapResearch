bipolar,feapd3e,t3_enx9eu,1578951033.0,This hit hard. We live with the hope that tomorrow may bring something better or different. Some days it does and some days it doesn’t. When you do have a day that you don’t suffer try to remember it to combat the shitty days that will inevitably follow. Every little while there will be days that are good enough to carry you to the next.
bipolar,feandry,t3_eo4vwp,1578950547.0,Regardless of how I was feeling my wife always pushed me to go in. “Cry at your desk” she said. Today is one of those days.

I disagree, however, that he should be fired. An apology and commitment to reform should suffice. As someone who has been through joblessness it is a very heavy punishment to hand someone."

bipolar,f5yy654,t3_dpvi2e,1572563458.0,IMO Go easy on the kid. Treat him as if he were another adult and you may find that yelling at him becomes unacceptable to you. You don’t yell at people at work. You shouldn’t yell at him. Consider using other tactics like allowance/chores or special prizes as motivators. Yes I am a parent.
