Anxiety,fkdbopo,t1_fkcjxfj,1584073558.0,"Do you have a representative or advocate? Maybe student services? You could ask them what the situation looks like. I think fall would be too far out to make solid plans, but you can only know by asking someone who knows. :)"
Anxiety,fj9cfr4,t3_fc2htm,1583142011.0,"Same here! Ever since I can remember. All the way back to preschool. Meds have taken the edge off, but they're not gone."
depression,fhgiq97,t3_f32bw6,1581568226.0,"I've been on that dosage for years. It's really helped! I recommend taking it with food to avoid an upset stomach. It kinda keeps me awake, so I take it in the morning. I don't remember if it alone has effects with alcohol, but I recommend being very cautious with drinking. The combination I'm on makes me very sensitive to alcohol, so while I can drink, it's best to have very small amounts."
Anxiety,fgvewao,t3_f0jvzy,1581147371.0,Yay! I had to retake mine because the parking space at the end of the course was intentionally too small.  ðŸ˜¡
Anxiety,fgl3nij,t3_eytywd,1580880988.0,I'm 33 and finally feel emotionally ready for high school! About twenty years late.
Anxiety,ffvbqh1,t3_evawj5,1580260372.0,"I feel you. I've had them go off on a false alarm before. It is no fun at all. And I hate loud noise. I've had some luck rationalizing it. I'm glad the alarm works! It would be worse if it didn't. Giving it a personality helps a bit too. I imagine it trying to help. With googly eyes! :)

I know the feeling of wanting to be anywhere else. It ramps down after a while. Having calm music on with some headphones has helped, too!"
Anxiety,ffvaq3a,t3_ev90we,1580259691.0,"Absolutely. I find it hard to keep that mentality, though."
Anxiety,ffvaii7,t3_evb07h,1580259550.0,I understand completely. I still have nightmares about PE long after. Shrug that shit off. They're not important. :)
Anxiety,fe2wvx0,t3_enndce,1578843710.0,"Right on! Giving anyone a large speaking engagement a day beforehand and with no information on its content is ridiculous. EDIT: and they had enough time to print programs yet didn't mention this to you, the speaker? I'm incensed."
depression,f6v62ql,t3_dt2k3z,1573177591.0,"I have dreamed of creating an app or service that connects depressed people with informal help. Like... Depression Excellent Resource Platform... DERP! Need help cleaning that garage, but existence is pain? Get somebody from DERP to help you!"
