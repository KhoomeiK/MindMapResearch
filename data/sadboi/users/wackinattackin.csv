AnorexiaNervosa,fdc5w67,t3_eki47q,1578267721.0,"A similar thing happened to me a few months back (even though it had happened many times).  My mom, my sister and I went to the mall and they wanted to go to Bar Louie for lunch, a restaurant not me approved and I had never gone before. Once we sat down, I knew I was going to have to get something so I looked at the menu and noticed the calorie count next to the meals. They were all over 1000 calories. I started freaking out. It was embarrassing, looking back. My mom let me off the hook, but those incidents are always the worst. Crying or having a tantrum at a restaurant is always the worst. One time I was forced to eat an entire bowl of shepherds pie or eat a slice of pizza in front of my fam in order to leave the table(my parents were trying what they could to help). I started screaming and crying and begging, acting like a two year old. All while not just my parents, but my 13 year old sister were forced to watch. Now, I am farther  into recovery and have not melted down in awhile, but I can definitely relate to your experience. It seems impossible, but there is hope to get past these times."

Divorce is hard on a kid of her age, she clearly is just being rough on you because she is upset. That is why I think you should not be rude to her about her response to the gift because she is having a hard time with getting used to you and being mean is not going to help change her opinion. I think it is important that you try to be nice to her and give her the bracelet back. I don‚Äôt think anyone sucks here, really. You guys just need to be good to one another."
