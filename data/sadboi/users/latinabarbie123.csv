transgender,fi11csa,t3_f5itku,1582048712.0,"And they question it, because they hate trans people and want to question their validity because it makes their insecurities feel better. It’s 2020, we have srs and hrt. And to me srs is not even needed to feel like I have transitioned. If we define being a woman by simply having a vagina and being able to give birth then yes. But if you do that, you are also basically saying that’s all woman are good for, so if you don’t possess these abilities you aren’t one. Another thing, is whether cisgender people like it or not, many trans people appear more feminine and a lot better looking than some cisgender woman. You want to call one a boy, but they they are way more beautiful than the other ? That just doesn’t sit well with me. Ofcourse you can do what you want but that’s really backwards. 

 I am legally female, my estrogen levels are in the female range. I look better than a lot of cisgender females. Yes this offends some people for whatever reason, but regardless of them being offended I continue to live my life as a female. And more importantly I’d rather be myself than them any day. You are not more valid than me, simply because you were born female."

You were most likely attracted to the ts woman because she looks like a woman. Everything will be okay. The feelings are normal I guess just try to keep these facts in mind. Oh and if it helps...:.
