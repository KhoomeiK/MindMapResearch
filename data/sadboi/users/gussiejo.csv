I can only speak for me, but what helped immensely was a birth control method that prevents ovulation, therefore, I have no period. 

I'm not advising anyone, but I've been on depo Provera and I don't get those PMS migraines. I still get others, but those kicked my tail."

I agree that you should seek professional help. Are you in a position to do that? That's a crucial starting point to figure out what's going on biologically so you can start feeling better and work on the rest.
