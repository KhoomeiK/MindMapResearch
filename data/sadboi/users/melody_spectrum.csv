In school I was always treated as this genderless entity for the most part. Classmates liked me fine as far as I could tell (even approached to convince me to come to the graduation celebration which I was planning to skip), but there was never any interest of That kind. I circumvented it by occasionally asking for hugs in exchange for help with homework (I was The Smart Person) so at least I got to experience human contact a few times lmao.

As far as I recall I was showed attention exactly once... by a 40-something married exchange student from a third country who suggested ""we become very close friends"" after i showed him how to extend library return deadline (was asked and am nice, didn't think anything of it until he started talking). Naturally I bailed immediately.

I tried asking a couple guys out myself (just suggesting going to an open public event sort of deal, knew him for a while before then, so nothing creepy) and was politely turned down/subject changed. May have been out of my league tbh though was definitely not very good looking, just really quite funny.

About sums up the entirety of my experience.

By now I've accepted/made my peace with it for the most part, though I still have that curiosity of ""what exactly is wrong with me though"". Never ballsed up enough to ask any guys, and the few women always act surprised and go ""What!! You'll definitely find someone!"" Yeah after quarter of a century I have my doubts.
