dpdr,fhcgge9,t1_fhcdgwq,1581462579.0,"I think to respond inquisitively/with curiosity rather than fear and grasping is a good step. A desire to cut through false presumptions. Maybe everything I’ve said is false, but you can’t know that for sure until you yourself make a genuine investigation into the nature of your experience. 

A lot of people, myself included, tend to respond to DPDR with inaction. A frozen kind of fear where the thoughts become like a dark storm. We over intellectualize the experience. To remain active in the world while maintaining a strong desire to know the truth can keep the mind from falling into that infinite loop, that terrible trap. 

It’s like we can look below and see that there is no floor beneath our feet and start flailing around in panic. But if we allow our life to continue unfolding we might see how it is somehow all supported even though there is no logical explanation for it. After some time the sadistic urge to throw ourselves into that pit of despair might start to soften and eventually disintegrate into well-being, without having the need to understand how it all works, or the process we are undergoing. Notice how there are no problems when firmly established in the present moment, without grasping at self-concepts or concerning ourselves with ourselves. Life knows how to live."

dpdr,fhbpclb,t1_fhacq5q,1581447024.0,"Time is also a concept. The changing seasons happen always while you are present, never before or after. And the universe permeates with intelligence and is self-organizing. All organisms are cut from the cloth of the universe. 

The more “you” get out of the way the greater room there is for the inherent intelligence to operate. The ego does not keep the body alive and yet those processes are far, far more complex than deciding what to eat for dinner or when to pay the bills. The ego will constantly insist it is needed so as to remain in bondage. It is not needed. It will always be there, as a personality, but it is not what moves the wheel. That part is illusory. But it cannot he willingly given up, it seems. 

Only when suffering reaches its threshold and the mind is sufficiently exhausted will it release the narrative of a personal-self. Because it does require constant reinforcement from thinking to maintain that personal sense of self. But again, it does not take constant reinforcement from thought to breathe, for blood circulation, for the processes of sleep, for the trillions of actions being performed in the body every second. Identification with ego is why humans suffer - DPDR or not. But it isn’t running the show, and those who start to experience depersonalization know that intuitively on some level. If that knowledge is repressed we suffer greatly, if it is accepted we are free."

dpdr,fh9zhfp,t1_fh9vrfy,1581393279.0,"Oh I’ve tripped many times, and have had the most hellish experiences along with the most blissful. I think I understand where the imagery of eternal torment comes from after having some of those experiences. 

When I say selfless I mean there is no sense of an individual, isolated self. Instead there is only the totality of existence, being-ness, life... I also suffered from extreme DPDR for 5 years. 

My take on it is that when there is an orientation to life that “I am living a life” vs “life is just happening” you are confined within the madness of the mind. The mind sees that wholeness, totality, or lack of separation as a total void. The ego, in that state, is starved for validation, for its own existence. But I don’t see the ego as having an existence that it thinks it does. It is just another happening. And when we identify with, or believe in it, we suffer immensely - especially when we can sense that it is not ultimately real.

But there is no self in ego, there is nothing really there. The thing that freaks out in DPDR IS the ego. And you are not that. Nor am I or anyone else. 

To me, in those profound moments of connection, I actually had no fixed identity. It makes no sense, but everything happening was of the same thing, if you catch my drift. There was no relation to “me” and “that”. 

DPDR does not have to imply a negative experience, imo. For me, I don’t feel like a person. I don’t take my personality personally anymore, because I don’t have a choice. I don’t see that normal form of human identification as real. I fought it for years and wanted nothing more than to be “normal” again but eventually the freak outs started to dissolve into the same space as my identity was. The mind that thinks it knows reality started to seem like a dream. 

And it still does. But so long as there is no identification on the mind-image of self, what remains is more real than anything I could ever have thought up. Life is a mystery. For many years all I could do was grasp at self-concepts, and the DPDR was totally void. Now I sense a great emptiness, but it is not scary, it is not evil or bad or unfortunate. It is so intimate and yet I can’t sense a relationship between two things.. there is just this movement of life. Death isn’t scary anymore, because life doesn’t seem real in the sense that I am a person who was born and who will die. I don’t know what “I” am. I think many with DPDR can relate to a lot of that, but many of us are so conditioned to grasp and cherish this sense of a personal identity that gets thrown in the furnace when DPDR hits and hell becomes a reality. 

This confusion can pass. Fighting it is a losing battle, in my experience. Surrender is the way through. The mind will never cease grasping at non-existent straws. Ever. And thus hell is eternal, unless you repent from the self-image. DPDR co-existing with the personal self-concept is literally the hell humanity has conceived of, I really believe that. 

I appreciate your sharing. I think you and everyone here is just a paradox away from a great release of tension. While DPDR can be horrible, the human condition in itself is endless suffering. But that purity and wholeness you speak of is more real than our egos, I think, and once we wake up from the dream of humanity, we will realize how OKAY everything truly is. Not because it fits some expectation (because it doesn’t) but because we realize our thoughts and perceptions of reality have no staying-power, they aren’t what’s really real."
dpdr,fh9tr6t,t1_fh9tifv,1581389412.0,What was your trip like? And how does that experience contrast to the DPDR when you are feeling especially tormented? I think there is a very fine line between that beautiful experience of selflessness and freedom you can experience on psychedelics vs the torture chamber of DPDR when there is still a self-concept fighting against the dissolution.
dpdr,fh9ll90,t1_fh9ifsq,1581384149.0,"When the mind is freaking out, it is absolute, utter hell. But that’s not what people are referring to when they talk about ego death or enlightenment.

Time appears very real, but we are conditioned to presuppose it having a fundamental reality before we ever learn to question it. 

What is being proposed here is that all experience, not just time, is dream-like and ultimately unreal in the most absolute sense of the word. Reality is real, you could say, but our perceptions are no more reliable than when we go to sleep and dream, albeit “waking” life seems to be much more coherent. We may just be operating under an illusion of colossal proportion.

Every memory you have you have in the present moment. When you were having breakfast this morning it was immediate, now, not a memory. And now as you remember breakfast, you remember it now, in the immediate present. Later you may remember having that memory, and so on. The mind is not where it is at. The minds nature is to weave a web of experience, a coherent, singular “life” that it takes to be reliable and concrete. That is the nature of the mind. But the mind cannot know reality. 

Existence, anything, nothing, 0 or 1, is impossible by the dual reasoning of mind. Everything becomes an infinite regression. Everything a paradox. Do not dismiss your memories as untrue, do not accept them as true. Accept them as they appear to be, but do not be fooled into thinking there is an answer anywhere. An answer is not needed, the non-dual nature of reality is easily recognized. It is so simple but we as people are too damn smart to see it! 

The mind can never know the truth, by its own nature. I am not a teacher and so it is hard to convey these words concisely. Life is playful, but it is no more or less real than the imagination. 

The things you hear.. that there is no time.. that there is no separation.. they aren’t for the mind. The work is in wearing the filter of the mind down so as to actually listen deeply to what is being said. 

Eternity is not everlasting time. Eternity is beyond a beginning and end. Behind Creator and created, beyond everything. Beyond love, beyond beauty, beyond peace.. totally ineffable. The mind tends to cling to these highest notions, but even they are bondage when they are separated as the knower and the known. Freedom is beyond all, and eternity is its home."
