Do only you draw for the school newspaper (therefore a consistent style in the school newspaper), or do the other alters also draw for the school newspaper? Honestly, I think it'd be really cool if all of you did. The style changes would make things really interesting. Have you ever drawn yourself? If so, could you possibly send it? Also why do you have to sign with Jack's name? That's unfair >:(

About names, is your nickname Cas or is that your full name (usually Cas is short for Cassandra/Cassidy)? 

It's not bad to be sensitive! I'm really emotional and sensitive too and tend to overreact to things, but it's definitely helped me help others and listen to others. I'm sure it will (and has) help you too!

Have you made food other than desserts? I could link you to some healthy-ish recipes if you want (one does have chicken in it and dairy as well, you could replace the dairy with a soy version due to you being lactose intolerant, I've done that due to my family forcing me to eat kosher).
