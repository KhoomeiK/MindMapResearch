Anxietyhelp,fboyk5j,t1_fbovx4l,1577015718.0,It‚Äôs free but there‚Äôs restricted content that you pay a subscription for. I think it‚Äôs like $13 a month- or $70 for a year.
Anxietyhelp,fbovu0m,t1_fbovk53,1577014996.0,I really like it. I mainly use it for the sleep stuff because its the best thing I‚Äôve found to combat that. But the other meditation stuff is good and covers a whole load of specific anxiety situations.
Anxietyhelp,fbnwxhc,t3_edzq2p,1577004286.0,"I have a lot of problem with sleeping when I‚Äôm anxious also. I think it‚Äôs the hardest to switch your brain off and to just try and relax.

The best thing I‚Äôve found, besides medication and therapy for anxiety in general, is the headspace app. They have a whole section on sleep that I think is really useful. I personally like the sleepcasts, they‚Äôre like stories that are combined with meditation and soundscapes that are different each night and really relaxing. I find just putting something on like that often gives my brain something else to latch to other than my thoughts. And they‚Äôre not overstimulating like watching tv or something."
DadForAMinute,fbnksnf,t1_fbnjsry,1576999323.0,"My trigger points are stuff to do with self confidence and abandonment and self worth (hence why my dad pops into my head even if it‚Äôs nothing to do with him). The self speak is the worst. I‚Äôm working through it and trying to challenge those self schemas etc but I find it hard when I‚Äôm physically feeling exhausted from panic attacks etc to then try and actively think against my schemas too.

I reached out to him through a cousin a year ago when my uncle (his brother in law) died. I saw this cousin for the first time since my dad left and she was urging me to speak to him (since it was her dad that died) and I found out he had told them I stopped speaking to him coz I don‚Äôt like my step mum, rather than him cutting off contact with me after I tried for over a year to make it all work. She contacted him for me saying I wanted to see him and talk to him and he said he was happy with how things are, happy not seeing me, and if I desperately wanted to see him I know where they live and can go apologise.

If anything it‚Äôs just made me feel worse coz now all the hope I had was gone and strengthens those feelings bout myself."
DadForAMinute,fbnjao1,t1_fbni5eb,1576998670.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry for what you went through with your friend but I‚Äôm glad both of you came out of that in the best way possible.

My mum and I have just never been particularly close. After I was born she had really bad post-partum depression and was hospitalised and I‚Äôll for the first few years of my life. This kind of resulted in her being a lot closer to my brother and me being a lot closer to my dad. So when he left it‚Äôs made me feel more lost and hanged up on in my family.

We get along loads better now but she‚Äôs always gonna have that stronger connection with my brother and I always going to feel slightly left out and that‚Äôs fine, I just wish I had someone in my court again like I did with my dad. 

I‚Äôm going through therapy myself, to sort out this whole mess and it‚Äôs helping loads and I‚Äôve improved a heap but it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not hard. I‚Äôm mostly doing so much better but idk when I have bad days (like I am currently) it all just comes rushing forward like a wave and I‚Äôm just stuck underwater and can‚Äôt breathe. It‚Äôs just very overwhelming. Makes me miss him comforting me."
DadForAMinute,fbng1tf,t1_fbncxtq,1576997222.0,"Yeah I keep trying to remind myself of just that. I think what‚Äôs so hard is coming to terms with the fact he‚Äôs not the person I thought he was. It makes me feel like my whole childhood is tainted. I know it‚Äôs not unless I believe that myself but it‚Äôs just my natural instinct feeling I guess. 

I just find myself a tad lost without him since I‚Äôm not so close to my mum. She does her best but we just butt heads and I feel critiqued by her even if she doesn‚Äôt mean it. But her reaction to him leaving etc has just made me appreciate her more and realise how awful he is for doing this. I just had a very close relationship with my dad and he was a stable figure in my life up until I was 15 and it was just a sudden change."

Anxiety,fa5zzal,t3_e7qu46,1575819724.0,"Same here. My psych said something similar in terms of that I can experience obsessive thoughts, like yours, but I don‚Äôt really have compulsions so cannot be diagnosed with OCD. I have been diagnosed with GAD, specialised anxiety, PTSD and have strong depressive symptoms. I‚Äôm still working on it and they still come around but I have found noting to work really well and grounding to work the best when my brain goes off track and I can‚Äôt unstick it.
I also find the headspace meditation app a really great tool for guiding those kind of practices.

Medication has also been really helpful in terms of getting me to a state that is not so anxiety driven so I can work on the bigger picture. I think medication is a great first step when it all feels overwhelming."
AnxietyDepression,f9onbxi,t1_f9na1ev,1575508808.0,"Im still working through the after effects now with therapy and medications, but I‚Äôd say the main gist of the breakdown and panic attacks were gone within 6 months. I think that‚Äôs about how long it took me to feel somewhat like myself again.

I‚Äôd say the biggest change I‚Äôve noticed was in the past few months- I decided to defer from uni to focus on getting myself better and that was really what I needed to stop in order to allow myself to recover. The added stress of uni was just too much and the holidays were just never long enough ya know üòÖ 

I know it‚Äôs not always feasible but would recommend taking a quick break and focus on self care things if you can. I didn‚Äôt realise how much stress uni was until I stopped."
AnxietyDepression,f9lrg4z,t3_e5mduy,1575430107.0,"About a year ago I had a mental breakdown which skyrocketed my anxiety to the point of being unbearable.

Maybe doing what is ‚Äúright‚Äù isn‚Äôt what is going to work for you- maybe start little by looking at one thing that gives you joy and you love and see how you can work around that- rather than what people expect of you.

I know it sounds a bit stupid but I on a whim chose to go with what my heart wants to do for the first time in my life, rather than what I think is the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing to do and the feeling was unreal. It‚Äôs not easy tho things are goin shit along with it but if you stick through it might work."

I can‚Äôt pass this up I will hate myself forever if I do and where I am now isn‚Äôt going to give me those opportunities. I have a good support system here I had just had my hopes my boyfriend of 4 years would come with me and now he won‚Äôt even consider it. So now I‚Äôm going alone and I‚Äôm scared.

AmItheAsshole,f4ke5y8,t3_dkqv29,1571648346.0,NTA. Everyone‚Äôs comments about maybe getting her her own sponge etc are good ideas to help her feel comfortable but I suggest a good chat to explain to her how washing the dishes will not cross contaminate etc as a way to properly educate her is important too. I imagine she‚Äôs heard some stuff that‚Äôs quite scary and talking to her about it would probably ease whatever anxiety she seems to have about this all.

AnxietyDepression,f1tcuy9,t3_dap89c,1569742334.0,"I have always been quite a messy person but once my anxiety started to get worse I actually found cleaning quite an enjoyable way to relieve stress and anxiety. It can generally be something I can control and keeping your bedroom/living space stress free and calming really helps overall. It obviously isn‚Äôt easy to start and I find it is harder when I‚Äôm depressed but starting a routine with it helped me. 

I kind of started researching room aesthetics to find what I enjoy/what I find peaceful (for me it‚Äôs lots of plants, natural light and minimalism), and also looked at smart storing techniques etc. So for example, I‚Äôm not good with looking after plants so cactuses are a good compromise. I also have a relatively small room so I made use of the storage under my bed and got rid of a big drawer chest so the room seems more spacious. I made lots of lists to see maybe what I think might be helpful for organising, what I need to buy, how I can make it happen, etc.

Now generally when I am overwhelmed with lots of things to do, I know cleaning my room is the one kind of simple thing I can do to get the ball rolling as I know where everything goes and it‚Äôs more of a simpler process.

I hope this kind of helps x good luck you got this!"
Anxietyhelp,f1one6g,t3_dabmuo,1569652969.0,I saw my regular GP to get medication and to also get referred to a psychologist. GP‚Äôs however don‚Äôt seem to have as much knowledge about medication as maybe a psychiatrist does- so with them I would say it‚Äôs technically more trial and error but most anti anxiety medications are pretty good. I would suggest talking to your GP first to discuss your options.
AnxietyDepression,f1ohih9,t3_dabdbj,1569645787.0,I don‚Äôt think it makes you a bad friend at all.

Anxietyhelp,f1nxdyd,t3_da3gpm,1569628938.0,"The Headspace app is the best for guided meditation. I love the sleepcasts especially- they‚Äôre like meditation + calming stories + soundscapes that I find are really helpful to get you to sleep when your mind is racing. The regular meditations are all organised into category relating to how you‚Äôre feeling/what you‚Äôre dealing with (ie. anxiety, depression, anger). I find these more effective than the traditional method as when I‚Äôm anxious etc my brain doesn‚Äôt wanna focus on something calm so having a voice to tune into does a lot."
