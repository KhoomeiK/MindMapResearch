bipolar,fbt6psl,t1_fbst5wx,1577069781.0,Seriously! They don’t believe me because “I don’t have delusions and “am not crazy”” but that’s not what bipolar is at all but convincing them that is like pulling teeth

dpdr,f6j57mh,t3_dq8vyl,1572889344.0,"I used to think I was the only one who thought this way. It was so bad that if I turned my head away from my food/drink for less than a second I wouldn’t be able to eat because I would convince myself so much that someone drugged me and that I’d feel dissociated again. 

I still have these thoughts but I’ve gotten better at managing them and now I would say I’m about 90% good with leaving my food on a table in a restaurant to go to the bathroom etc. there are still things I will avoid like if I know a food has hemp in it, I will avoid it at all costs because my dp was caused by smoking weed"
