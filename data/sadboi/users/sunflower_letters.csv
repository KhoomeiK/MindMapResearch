BPD,fpu8h3h,t3_gfku2m,1588906970.0,"Yeah I did that with the guy I'm talking to and I regret it so much. Now when he's talking to me about his life I have to pretend like it's new information to me. 

I stopped myself a week ago from going further, because I knew I would try to deep dive into google. I would suggest stopping now, and try to think about how you would want to find out this information about him naturally. Try to steer conversations to be about his personal life and friends (without going overboard) so that he tells you the information without you having to look it up yourself. Distract yourself by thinking of how you would describe your personal stories about your life. I came up with some good stories to tell him so that I'm distracted from obsessing over him, so that in turn he can talk about himself later on. I hope it works out!"
BPD,fpu74cg,t1_fpt3ojt,1588906116.0,"yup. I don't know when to mention self-harm or those harmful inner thoughts because I don't know at what point will she think I'm a threat to myself. I wish there was a way to talk about it with them, but unfortunately that's not the case. However when it comes to the relationship with your cousin, if you're comfortable enough with your therapist, I'm sure there is a good way to explain your past. I really don't think he'll judge you for it. I really wish you all the best with your therapist, and in general. Please take care!"
BPD,fpu6qlc,t1_fpsyqoj,1588905877.0,"I'm so glad it's working out for you! I understand completely, and unfortunately I have a limited amount of sessions due to my insurance, so I really have to speed up this process. I wish you the best!"
BPD,fpu6ll0,t1_fpsw7s0,1588905790.0,"Journaling is a good idea. I've done it before during a time when I was at my breaking point with my first therapist, and I wrote out all of my thoughts. Issue with it is I barely got through the whole thing. Writing it out is the easy part, I think saying it out loud is what I'm so scared of. I think it's good to write out the experience when I'm manic and feeling the worst so that I can explain exactly how I feel. Thanks, I think I'm going to have to try that out again."
BodyDysmorphia,fpu685v,t1_fptsgq3,1588905556.0,"Yeah! I really like other people's mannerisms and I try to copy them sometimes lol but my automatic and relaxed self goes back to the weird mannerisms. But I do understand the individuality thing, I like those quirks as well! I really wish the best for you!"
BodyDysmorphia,fpu61s2,t1_fptlkz8,1588905445.0,yeah I 100% get it :( I wish you the best with it though!
BodyDysmorphia,fpu5xxe,t1_fpthi79,1588905379.0,"Yup, the running thing is an issue with me as well lol. I also feel the ""too ugly for being feminine"" thing, it doesn't look like it fits me at all even though I like being feminine :( I really hope you overcome it! Its a struggle for sure but I'm sure we'll find a way to appriciate ourselves."
BPD,fpsouu1,t1_fpsn734,1588877103.0,yeah probably. I just hope I can get everything out as soon as I can.
BPD,fp2v1om,t3_gassls,1588268360.0,"That constant being on the verge of exploding is so tiring. I censor myself from others when I know something is about to happen. I just stop talking with them and stay by myself for a few days. It's so hard to explain what those emotions are when people don't understand. I really wish the best for you, and I'm sure you'll find that you're in control soon :)"
BPD,fp2ufkc,t1_fozyrzx,1588268069.0,"this is actually a really good thing to do. I don't get jealous of people unless they have something to do with the people I care about, and then all of a sudden jealousy strikes, even about physical beauty. I think this helps; getting closer with those people and getting to know them instead of hating them for no reason. It does help a lot."
BPD,fp2u0mu,t3_gazy08,1588267869.0,"I'm so sorry you've experienced this. I can't imagine how hard that was. Sometimes you get so caught up with emotions and idealizations you forget to ground yourself to realize the truth. This illness is so tiring, and I really hope it gets better for you. I know this is probably a vent but it hit close home for me. I really wish you well."
BPD,fp2sxbv,t1_fp0v0cb,1588267354.0,I agree. I didn't even know my symptoms spilled over into my school until I stopped going to classes because I thought the profs saw me as a failure. It messed with me so much and I just thought I was a bad student.
BPD,fp2l04t,t3_gamtl8,1588263563.0,"Sounds like my mum, i won't lie. Despite working in social services, and with people who have these issues, she still seems to group them all as ""crazy"". It's so hard to open up to someone like that, so I understand. It's really tiring to experience, but I hope it gets better for you."
BPD,fp2jwlb,t1_fp2jihn,1588263024.0,Thank you :)
BPD,fp2io0t,t1_fp2hvd7,1588262414.0,"yeah, I guess so. I'm going to have to think about how to word everything so I don't come off as mad or desperate. Thanks"
