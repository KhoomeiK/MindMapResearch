A more believable approach would've been to release ""Antrum"" as a lost film of unknown origins. Would've been more effective letting your imagination fill in the backstory.

They should've released it as a standalone film instead of trying to make it all edgy. Nothing more than a desperate attempt to get more people to watch.
