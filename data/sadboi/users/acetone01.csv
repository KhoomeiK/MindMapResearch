And yes, sometimes it helps when people with  dpdr have the same experiences as you but there isn't much to do with it, you just have to wait it out I guess. I just wondered it it was coneccted with OCD so I could control it that way."
dpdr,fcxhfpx,t3_ejar24,1578063011.0,"This really helped! Thank you so much.

You perfectly discribed what I'm feeling. I've been struggling with a really bad dpdr episode for about 5 months now. I'm guessing a really bad panic attack caused it. 

Yeah, this sub is helpfull for not feeling alone but it triggers me alot of times too. I have really bad suicidal OCD and seeing posts saying they are going to end their life and people in the coments just saying 'same' sends me into a spiral. That's why I'll probably bee leaving this sub soon. I will definetly save this post and read it when I'll need reassurance.

For people struggling, it does get better. Mine isn't gone but the 'waves' of extreme dpdr are getting alot smaller. First cuple of mothts were just constant anxiety, obsessive thinking and dissociation but now these feeling kinda come in waves and are getting shorter each day. Some days are better then the others but there is still improvment.

Because of my OCD I also suffer from somniphobia (phobia of sleep) so sleeping helps with dpdr but my somniphobia doesn't really let me use it that much. 

I just wanna ask does therapy help? I've been to a therapist but she didn't really know alot about dpdr so I stoped going. Only thing that she kinda helped me with is saying that the whole automatic thing (like walking and talking) is normal, people just don't think about what they're doing like we do. If you were thinking about everthing you do your brain would overwork itself. You ARE controling everithing you do just subconsciosly."

I ended up staying home because I really didn't feel like going anywhere even though I've been invited to few places. I didn't drink anything but I can tell you that I had fun staying home and enjoying my peace. At some point my friend called me because supposedly she was very drunk which kind of triggered my anxiety.
Regardless I'm pretty sure she wasn't as drunk as she was telling me.
I can tell you that the fear of getting drunk is mostly gone. I've had a few drinks since I've made the post and I was fine! I'm still kind of scared of getting blackout drunk but I'm sure I can control myself.

Do you think therapy will help tho? 
I've was going to a therapist but she didn't really help me and talking about it just triggerd it more but I think my OCD is to blame on that. Yeah, OCD also makes things 10 time worse because I'm obsessivly thinking about it every second of the day."

I was recovering for a few months and I'm fine right now but  EVERY time I'm stressed or anxious I get the exact same stomack pain liek I used to. Even now when I'm thinking about it it hurts.

It's like a burning, heavy feeling. 
For me, that pain is my stomack acid 'acting up' or like, bubbeling? (I'm not a doctor so I don't know the right terms)
Maybe you're going through the same thing.
The thing that helped me when I was sick and that I still use when I'm stressed are pills that calm down your stomack acid. I'm from Croatia so I don't know what medication is avalable to you but I use Emanera 20g and 40g. You should probobly consolt your doctor about it but I'm pretty sure they aren't harmful so you can drink them whenever your stomack hurts."

dpdr,fbltnjw,t1_fblseyw,1576969980.0,"Having an actual dp/dr dissorder is very rare but dp/dr can occur because of overwhelming anxiety or depression where your brain gets overworked with with the stress or the negative thoughts or anything similar and just 'gives up'. It's a coping mechanism for your brain when you face very stressful situations (in most cases). People who are more  prone to dp/dr when dealing  with stressful situations there dp/dr strikes up. I think I'm experiencing it because of of my high levels of anxiety and OCD.

You can read some symptoms online and see if you relate to them. [Here are some examples](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depersonalization-derealization-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352911)
Just don't deep dive about the subject because you'll just scare youself.
