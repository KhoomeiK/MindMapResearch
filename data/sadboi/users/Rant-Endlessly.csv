UIUC,fniy6g5,t1_fnisy76,1586988469.0,i dont understand what was so confusing abt my post. You decide to drop a class = you STOP doing work for the damn class. My mother said she lets me do it and then she changed her mind when it was too late. You know nothing abt my mom. How can u defend an abusive bitch like her you don’t know what she does to me
UIUC,fniwa2k,t1_fniw4mc,1586987485.0,Im also a dres student who is allowd to underload but im not sure if that makes me not a full time student but like a dropped a class back in February and underloded and literally there was no financial consequence
UIUC,fniul9j,t1_fniuibx,1586986633.0,idk thats what my mom said. she said id have to return my financial aid back.
UIUC,fnitw0r,t1_fnito12,1586986280.0,Bcs she said i could drop it....and so i put in a request to underload(which is just a formality they already said it would get approved) and I stopped doing all work for the class OBVIOUSLY and now she is telling me I cant drop it but ive already failed the class beyond saving
UIUC,fmh83wx,t3_fv4i1c,1586069930.0,hahaaha im failing all my classes hahaha

UIUC,flpsdub,t1_flowq3v,1585367482.0,"Yeah sure ill just drop all of my classes and pay another $18,500 and graduate after everyone else. Best case scenario I do what I can with crippling depression while 5 family members are screaming and maybe reach C. RIP my gpa they could have literally only let the seniors continue, given kids with important prereqs the most essential info and incorporated the rest into the next class. Or start the semester earlier. There’s literally a lot the school could do. If there’s a will there’s a way."

SuicideWatch,flmeb8k,t3_fpp2qc,1585281296.0,It is true :/ Pretty people get better jobs and shit. There was this one hoe on the forensics team that literally won everything by looking like a doll with a ton of makeup and a miniskirt 🙄

UIUC,fllv967,t1_fllt3o0,1585268460.0,oh yeah I forgot to mention about rescheduling or altering the courses. Like i would be dead next year too in one of my classes if we ended now but i feel like if we ended in 2 weeks and if they changed next years class a lil bit to give us some background it wouldnt be that bad 🤷🏻‍♀️
UIUC,flkk1dp,t3_fp2hv9,1585242380.0,everyone downvote this before they see it and decide students like this and we shouldnt suspend the semester early (maybe not rn but earlier) :’)

Angry? Im gonna fucking ace the shit out of this homework. Scared? If I dont do well on this assignment i wont be able to fix my life. Depressed?
