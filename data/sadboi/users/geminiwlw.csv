Anxiety,fpru2m4,t3_fj2y1a,1588862047.0,"A bit of personal good news: I went outside today for the first time in nearly two months and it was great!!! I’d been wanting to go outside for so long but the idea of going even for a short walk around the block would paralyze me with anxiety. Well today was the day I decided to say “Fuck you” to my anxiety and just go for it. And I did!!! I actually even ended up going to the store and treating myself to some chocolate and ice cream. It was warm and beautiful and I legit got emotional just feeling the sun rays on my skin for the first time in so long. 

Anyway, I just wanted to say to anyone here who might feel too overwhelmed or scared of going outside like I was: THERE IS NO REASON TO BE SCARED. As long as you follow the rules of conduct, you’ll be totally fine. And remember that better days are coming. We are already **well** on our way to that place.

And I know it’s been said before but I’m gonna keep saying it: **thank the heavens for this thread**. You guys have been my saving grace. 💕"

I know getting it by touching things etc. is much less likely, I guess I’m just worried about them coming in contact with cashiers etc., i.e. people who might potentially be or have come in contact with someone who might be virulent.

Okay so I thought that I was handling this fairly well, but this morning I woke up to an imminent panic attack and filled with an overwhelming amount of dread. There are as of yet no confirmed cases in my city, but that’s probably due to the fact that people aren’t getting tested and it’s only a matter of time before confirmed cases start popping up. There are about 30 cases total in my country and my city *still* hasn’t shut down large gatherings of people and everyone roams around and goes to coffee places etc. with no sense of concern or responsibility at all, which pisses me off to no end.

Another huge concern that’s making me crazy with worry is the fact that my family has recently been in an awful financial slump so we have no money in savings, and barely any food to survive the next couple of days, let alone longer, and if everything does go on lockdown I’m afraid that we will starve to death. This is not even an exaggeration — since the beginning of the year alone we’ve had so little income that most days we’ve had to go without the basic human necessities such as bread, basic medicine, vitamins or wet wipes. Right now we’ve got about $20 to live off of until my next payment, which is about three weeks away. I guess I’m not really that worried about not being able to go to the store, I’m more worried about not financially being able to get anything at all. 

Sorry for being such a downer, I really thought I was handling this fairly well but it just suddenly hit me that we’re dirt poor already and this is just making the whole thing that much more dire. I’m just absolutely terrified for us and what the next weeks will bring."
