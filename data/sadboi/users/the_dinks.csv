The problem with books for me was that you never had to actually read them (outside of the Magnum Opuses), your character just automatically inherited stat boosts, and you couldn't share knowledge with the people running your kingdom.

CrusaderKings,fqo3q49,t1_fqo2rnr,1589506948.0,"Good point. I think you could just do province modifiers though. Like ""has small Jewish community,"" ""has large Jewish community,"" etc. Then you could get events and revolts based on that kind of thing. Kind of like the Black Plague events. It just seems silly to me that in a game about medieval conquest, there's no religious minorities other than the ones in court. The Muslims in particular spring to mind; a lot of their strength was actually based off of letting people believe what they wanted (if they payed the Jizya tax, ofc). I'm really happy with the religious changes in CKIII so far but it still seems rather Eurocentric, ahistorical, and anti-fun to assume that every religion's endgame is converting everyone to your beliefs. They actually did a good job with that in Indian gameplay in CKII, but there were still ridiculous things happening like Jewish exiles hating their lord because they were zealous. Like, we were NEVER in a position to demand or expect conversion in Europe outside of around ~800 or so. Most Jews would have been thrilled if their lord had a Jewish counselor. Heck, we even celebrate non-Jews in the Bible who looked out for us, like Cyrus, who allegedly let us return from Babylon and rebuild the temple. It would be really cool to win over religious minorities like that in CKIII, while risking pissing off more zealous characters of proselytizing religions like Christianity.

edit: my main point is that ruling over a diverse group of people never seems to benefit you, at least more than it costs you. the optimal gameplay is ALWAYS to make everyone believe what you believe and follow your culture."

CrusaderKings,fqnbzdq,t1_fqnaczf,1589492167.0,"Really good question! Part of the reason it looks ""ugly"" in my opinion is that gem faceting is actually a fairly new technique. 

From wikipedia:

>Each plate of the crown is made out of a high carat gold, around 22 carats, which gives the crown a ""buttery"" colour, and is studded with pearls and precious stones. The stones are not cut into facets (a technique still unknown when the crown was made), but rather polished into rounded shapes. This technique is an ancient one and gemstones like this are described as being ""en cabochon"", which are still made to this day. The pearls and the stones were put into openings that were cut into the metal, and fastened with thin wires. The effect was that when the light shone in, the stones looked as if they would shine from within."

americanproblems,fqjenkc,t3_gipen1,1589408874.0,"You are growing up. I wasn't raised in a military family, but like most Americans, I was constantly told that America was the best. I grew up in a privileged household and that covered up a lot of problems. 

But the truth is that there isn't a ""best country,"" and even if there was, we would certainly not be it. What exactly makes us the best? Not our health care system. Not our education system. Not our runaway imperialist military. Not our deep legacy of racism and slavery. Not our incredible wealth disparity. Not our constant school shootings. Not our incredible levels of pollution and disregard for the environment. And fuck, not our dysfunctional government and rigged election system. Covid-19 makes this extremely obvious. The best country in the world can't be the one who is willing to kill hundreds of thousands of people in order to make more money that will just be funneled into the pockets of those who are already rich anyways.

There are three things you can do with this realization. One, you can try your best to ignore it, but I think that's pretty selfish. Two, you can live in denial and yell at football players for protecting police brutality and vote for Republicans who will just continue to screw us all over. The rich and powerful know that as long as people thing everything's great and America is the best, things will stay the same, and the status quo benefits them at our expense. That's why that narrative exists. They're afraid of you choosing option three, where you try your best to make the USA the shining city on the hill it could really be. 

For all the things I hate about America, there's a lot to appreciate as well. Our cultural output is amazing. Music, literature, movies, TV, games, art, etc. We have a diverse and rich food culture that incorporates the best elements of dishes from all over the globe. We've got so many awesome sports to watch. Most of all though, some of the greatest Americans have been the ones who tried the hardest to change this country. MLK, Harriet Tubman, Muhammad Ali, Frederick Douglass, Eleanor Roosevelt, etc. All of these people saw America for what it could be, instead of what it was, and fought for their dream. So, which one are you gonna be?  Are you going to keep believing that America is the best country ever as we spiral further and further to destruction? Or will you fight to change things? The choice is yours."

victoria2,fqghfv7,t1_fqdm0el,1589346363.0,"I don't agree with that assessment. Wilhelm II was not all-powerful, nor was he a lunatic. He was not very smart and very unrealistic, but that doesn't make him a complete crazy. The Prussian nobility/Junkers should share the blame, along with the army. The general staff wanted to invade Russia; it was feared that an industrialized Russia would mean an end to German dominance of Central Europe, and the imperialist mindset of the German elite could not accept that. That's the real reason they offered Austria-Hungary unconditional support. The German military knew that they would attack Serbia, pulling Russia into the war. They were the ones who came up with the Schlieffen plan, which ended up pulling the UK into the war. They were the ones to resume unrestricted submarine warfare, eventually pulling the USA into the war. Now, I'm not saying that these moves were strategic mistakes necessarily, nor do I think the UK would have been content to let Germany stomp all over Russia without doing anything about it. The point I'm making is that Wilhelm had relatively little to do with these developments.

Going back to Bismarck for a second, for as great of a diplomat as Bismarck was, he never trusted others or trained anyone to replace him. His unique talent could not be replicated, and he was the one who kept the balance of power tipped in Germany's favor. You could argue that this is hardly his fault, but an international arrangement that relied on careful diplomacy, which collapsed the moment Bismarck left, isn't actually a very good arrangement. He basically left his successors without the ties and relationships to European leaders that diplomacy relies on. This led to the alliances with Russia and GB to fall through. He also helped squash any liberal momentum after 1848. This came back to bite Germany in WWI when the nation went on strike in 1917-18 and eventually revolted.

I think it's tempting to view history as the results of the actions of great men, and sometimes that can be accurate. But we need to take holistic evaluations of events that incorporate all sorts of evidence. Some of these events may lack any human causal factors, like pre-modern climate change. Others may be broad social trends that were only obvious in retrospect. I think part of why you may think that it was all Wilhelm's fault is because the general staff of Germany shifted a lot of the blame for their mistakes towards the exiled monarch after the war. Also, I think the best thing Hitler ever did was to shoot himself."
