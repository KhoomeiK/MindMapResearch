AskReddit,fqw0tzy,t1_fqvml7j,1589689786.0,"Spoiler tag because it's that bad (took it straight from Wiki because my memory was shit):  

>! Milos, a semi-retired porn star gets offered a weird job by an unknown director, accepts it reluctantly. Scene starts out normal, BJ from a nurse while another woman watches. Has sex with the watcher's mother while she's still there. Milos resists but is forced to. Later discussion with director reveals his fucked up ""artistic style"" called ""newborn porn"" (he shows a video of a newborn infant being anally raped by an old bald guy he saw earlier in the movie).    

>! As Milos tries to run from this fucked up individual, he is seduced by a random doctor in a bar (?) and knocked unconscious. Wakes up bloodied and dazed in an unfamiliar room. Tapes start playing on a TV. He was drugged up while unconscious and induced into a sexually aggressive frenzy. In the tapes, you see Milos beat and rape the mother from earlier before beheading her. He is then sodomized by the director's security team. The woman who initially offered him the job (a co-worker of his) expresses concern about his actions and as punishment has her teeth removed. She is killed through suffocation by penis.  

>! Footage continues, Milos is led to the ""watcher's"" home where an elderly lady praises his deeds in killing the mother. He escapes but gets caught by some thugs, who are brutally murdered by the director's head of security and then Milos is brought to the warehouse and time has now caught up.  

>! Milos is about to be injected again by the doctor but he steals the syringe and kills the doctor by stabbing her in the throat. Somehow, they force him into a room with 2 dead bodies and he has sex with one while his jealous brother has sex with the other. It is revealed quite shortly after that his body is his own son (6 years old), and the body his brother is raping is his wife. He kills the director by smashing his head against the floor, his brother by smashing his head in with a sculpture, the security team by gun, and the head of security by inserting his penis into the guy's empty eye socket. Did I mention the head of security only has one eye? Director praises Milos' actions as truly ""cinema worthy"" with his dying breath"

Similar to how ranting to an uninvolved third party can make you feel better when angry, it's a common anger management tool. I just got caught doing it and the game's annoying ""feature"" of saving your text between rounds but auto-closing the text box at round end had me send it when I had no intention of doing so.  

Remains to be seen if that one instance (the only time I've been reported - or at least, only time someone has told me they reported me) will have any negative effect on my account going forward."
diablo3,fqqqw8v,t1_fqqpn83,1589570337.0,I think it's more like 260% isn't it? MoJ is 200% and gem is 60% (if maxed). But yeah I don't think Solo GR 150 (which is the highest GR level if memory serves) should truly be possible unless you have Primal Ancient everything with 120+ augments on all pieces. WD can hit like 120+ without any augments at all which is kind of disgustingly broken IMO. I just hope they tone up some of the numbers on other items just a tad (but 260% is overkill) or add a separate helm to replace MoJ in the build.
diablo3,fqqqeho,t3_gkeqpk,1589570084.0,"Only classes I would say suffer from feeling ""underpowered' right now are Demon Hunter and Necromancer. Necro's only viable high-GR build is corpse lance and I abhor that playstyle (ignoring trash and trying to get lucky with multiple elites in a single Land of the Dead cast). I guess Skeletal Mage LOD is viable now too? Which is pretty fun but VERY grindy (as all LOD builds are).  

Monk has Tempest Rush which is basically spinny boy 2.0, Wizard has Archon for some fast-paced mob murdering or LOD Hydra for serious grinding, Crusader has what I like to call Heaven's Shotgun (triple blasts of heaven's fury doing insane damage), and WD has the insanely-OP Spirit Barrage build as well as Dagger of Darts for some pet fun. After about 5-10 hours of play on each of these (not including the 30-40 hours of play on the Wizard at the beginning of the season to get started), I have a full build that can clear at *least* GR95 in 10 minutes or less and I've cleared GR100 with each of the above builds. I will admit that WW is the most ""brain-dead"", ""watch things go die"" build in the game (other than Tempest Rush) but other builds can be just as fun.   

If you want to pick one and go for it, I'd go with either Wizard Archon (takes time as it requires the Helm, Belt and Wand/Orb set combo to really open up the speed clears) which is basically ""teleport once a second and everything dies as soon as you arrive"" or the Demon Hunter UE Multishot build which is right-click and a massive wave of arrows kills all enemies in sight. My UEMS build can clear GR95 in about 5-6 minutes and only has 4 Ancient pieces (one of which I just recently augmented with a 70 gem) and my Wizard build is quite similar (but took longer to assemble). Only reason I said DH is underpowered above is because the damage fall-off when you start to be unable to kill trash quickly is quite noticeable and DH survivability is non-existent so you *have* to kill trash. As a result, even though I can clear GR95s in 6 minutes or less, I haven't been able to clear a GR101 yet because trash starts to get really tanky and I die to even the smallest of mobs.  

The LOD or N6M4 Rapidfire builds can kill trash quickly but I dislike how inconsistent the grenade bounce mechanic is so prefer not to use it."
diablo3,fqqph6l,t1_fqqp1g5,1589569611.0,"I think it always rolls vitality and movement speed, don't think CDR is a guarantee but I could be mixing up vit and CDR. Either way, shame it had both but still, I'd kill for such a good FoT. I haven't even gotten a good ancient one yet, let alone primal ;) My best one is non-ancient with Dex, CHD, Socket and 2 useless stats I can't quite recall."
diablo3,fqqp88m,t3_gkeiy8,1589569487.0,"Basically, the way Barber works with Manitou (and Phantasm) is kind of unintuitive.  

For Manitou, it only deals damage when the Spirit disappears (which is why you're seeing damage after 12-20 seconds - that's one of your Manitou spirits dying) OR if the damage it has accumulated is enough to kill the monster it is attacking (which is why trash mobs tend to die wayyy quicker than 12 seconds).  

For the record,  Phantasm, it is similar. Phantasm accrues damage based on how many enemies it hits (each enemy increases the damage by the same amount, so 10 enemies means 10x as much damage when it finally ""explodes"") over its lifetime. You can detonate the Phantasm bomb early by re-casting Phantasm (if there are already 3 in play) or let it detonate on its own when the spectres die. They will also explode prematurely if *all enemies in the Phantasm will die on explosion* which is pretty rare but happens if speed running sometimes.  

Also, yes targets outside BBV take less damage from Spirit Barrage because the ""spirit"" damage is accrued when the spirit touches the enemy, not when it launches from. So if the spirit lands outside of BBV, it doesn't gain the damage bonus (because spirits are treated like pets - this is fixed in Season 21)."
diablo3,fqqo9gb,t1_fqoz7lv,1589569002.0,"That's actually not bad at all, cooldown adds damage if your class is able to use Captain Crimson's set (not much but a bit) and CHD is more valuable than CHC on jewelry (because CHC can be on helm, bracer, and off-hand and CHD cannot) and especially on Amulet as it is double the CHD bonus over any other item (except Weapon Socket which is 130% I think). CDR is useful on a lot of builds even without Crimson as well, and Vitality is always a nice buffer (at least in my experience as typically my issue, especially on intelligence classes, is survivability and not damage)."

So if it's rush hour, bumper to bumper, yes, zipper merging works. But when people are advocating for zipper merging *at all times*, **especially** in areas where not everyone is doing it, they're advocating for not only less efficient but more dangerous driving conditions. In short, merge as soon as you can when getting on a highway, and be in the correct lane as soon as possible during off-peak hours when coming up to a lane closure at-speed.  

And [this article](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/all-hail-the-zipper-merge-how-canadian-politeness-is-killing-the-efficiency-of-our-highways) explains what I'm talking about in terms of ""it's not worth it unless everyone does it.""

I think the unifying factor is that I've never been able to find an office chair in-store that is able to support a straight-back posture. Every office chair I've sat in has had a slight recline to the back at the most-upright position, which is bad for posture. There are plenty more available online that may or may not have a straight-back position, but I wasn't able to find that information online. I stumbled across a review for the Vertagear that specifically mentioned its ability to sit straight up (and even recline 90 degrees so you can lie flat, altho idk why you'd ever want to do that in a chair, too narrow to lie down comfortable IMO) which is why I pulled the trigger even if it was a bit more pricy."

Best to get a good, quality headset and then a either clip-on mic (ModMic is best but even the $5 Zalman is fine) or a desk mic, depending on desk-space. Chairs I've already made my point above about why gaming chairs *can be* suitable for gamers over office chairs (price points for high weight ratings, mainly - but for me I wasn't able to find a comfortable office chair that support a straight-backed posture, but my gaming chair does).  

But gaming keyboards I'd say are worthwhile investments as well. The better ones out there are mechanical with good-quality switches and decent ergonomics for less than $200 price points - especially if you don't care about macros or RGB. In comparison, the best ergonomic mechanical keyboards I've been able to find are another $100-$150 over that. I paid $200 for my Roccat I just got a couple months ago and it is honestly the best keyboard I've ever used. Great switches that are proprietary Roccat, clean aesthetic which is important to me, no dedicated macro keys is a plus, still has a 10-key pad that I use for CS:GO, and non-dedicated media buttons. Software is trash but since I don't care about macros or customising RGB, it does it's job with the settings that are available.  

I would've gotten a Das Keyboard 4 but it's an extra $200 on [Amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/Das-Keyboard-Ultimate-Mechanical-DASK4ULTMBLU/dp/B00JKQSGWE?th=1) ($300 + $100 shipping for the blank key version - cheaper if you get the USB hub one but I'm already cramped for USB slots so don't want to have to use 2 ports for 1 device).

So yeah, don't buy a gaming chair if you can find an office chair that fits what you need. But there isn't an ""office chair for everyone"" unless you're willing to go even higher than what gaming chairs are priced at. Office chairs with high weight ratings cost more than my PC."

gamingsuggestions,fq7vl81,t3_gh9z8d,1589153109.0,"I mean, Escape from Tarkov or Hunt: Showdown come to mind. There's permanent progress in both but in slightly different ways. Both are ""take in whatever gear you want but if you die you lose it all"" games, very intense and both very different styles of games (different eras and gameplay loops) but have the ""permanent progress between matches"".  

Hunt has progress in that you unlock the ability to purchase better weapons and utilities the more you play, as well as stash items you find (but this isn't the main gameplay loop like it is in Tarkov).    

Tarkov has progress similarly but getting items in the match and getting out, stashing them, and repeating is the core gameplay loop whereas in Hunt it's more of a side thing (as the number of items you can carry in Hunt is much more limited). Tarkov is more an ""instance-based survival shooter with slight RPG aspects.""  

I'd recommend trying both."

EscapefromTarkov,fp07xvh,t1_fozsypg,1588204162.0,"I don't believe any of the clips in either the flusha video, or the Worrun video, are at all suspicious, and I'll explain why.  

One, both of these players have been playing long enough to be called ""masters"" of their respective games (10,000 hours or more). This in and of itself means their level of play will seem almost impossible to the average player, information they have shouldn't be possible, yet it is. Because they have so much time, they've all but memorized things like rotation timings, player behaviour in group situations versus solo, and become masters at adapting to new and unusual circumstances - because truly at this point, there are few circumstances that are ACTUALLY unusual for them. They've seen it all.  

This is compounded by the fact that their games are largely reviewable by the general public. Worrun is a streamer where any of his raids could've been recorded at the time they were made, and flusha is a pro CS player where most games have demos that are easily obtained and viewed, not to mention some of which are streamed live. I guarantee that if you record enough games of any player at that level, you would find suspect clips like tracing through walls and insane flick shots, because of the nature of these clips. Tracking movement that we can either hear or visualize inside our mind is second-nature. If you hear an opponent on the other side of the wall, you'll track them with your crosshair. If you feel (based on rotation timings for example, or sound that abruptly stopped) that they are moving in a certain direction, you will do the same. It's a natural movement. Of course, most of the time you'll be slightly off the mark but sometimes you'll perfectly trace them. The X-Ray function in CS:GO demo playback demonstrates this even moreso. This by no means definitively proves they were cheating, only that they are doing what comes natural to players at that level.  

The other reason is about flicks. There is a concept gaining traction throughout the FPS genre coined by one youtuber as the [""minor flick zone.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x89fa4EN7uI) This is basically the concept that muscle memory is easier to rely on than tracking your target ""manually."" That flicks are actually *easier* to hit than if you were to slowly move your mouse and track the target while firing, even if your mouse was perfectly positioned in the first place. If you've ever watched players like dizzy and aceu use the Wingman, you might understand what I mean. They move their mouse *away* from the target after each shot, flicking onto the target and then away again each time. This is because the muscle memory required to move your crosshair a set distance is easier to build up than the more complex process of tracking an opponent that could increase/reduce movement speed or target profile. It also requires a fraction of the brain power, as you only have to move the mouse to where the person is when you fire, instead of consistently having your mouse on target even when not firing the weapon. Seeing movement is easy for human beings, tracking movement not so much.  

So it makes sense that players like Worrun, flusha, shroud, WillerZ, and any number of other flick-based aimers that get the occasional cheat accusations would rely so heavily on a method of aiming that people seem to think is suspicious, when in reality it is anything but. People who are easily able to perfectly track players with automatic fire are more suspicious, in my mind, than those that can flick. This dates back to the days of Quake 3: Arena. Players that were good with the railgun made sense and were fairly common. But the gun that separated good players from great, was the lightning gun. Fires fast, does damage, but requires pinpoint accuracy on a moving target for long stretches of time to be effective.  

In short, I'm not making assumptions on methods. I've seen tons of ""proof"" videos on various streamers and pro players, and they always have the same underlying theme. That consistent ""flick"" shots are impossible, that tracking players through walls isn't common, and that tracking players while spraying is a common skill, when all three of these things are inaccurate in my experience.  

I also want to add [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xib9Y3lwR_E) for some extended viewing if you're curious whether I'm alone in my opinion. Popular streamer and semi-pro Summit1g watches a video that went viral a while back, detailing some more ""suspicious"" clips of shroud's play and debunks some of the clips in much the same way I tried to generalize above. I almost guarantee if given enough time and care, I could replicate this level of detail and scrutiny on the flusha and Worrun videos and give you exact reasons for their actions and reactions in each clip. It really doesn't take much thought, which is why I say people who make these videos and/or believe these claims are truly looking for confirmation bias, when even the most remote level of scrutiny would reveal the clips to be anything but suspicious. The reason I'm more vocal about this topic is because these claims can ruin reputations and careers. It happened not too long ago with [Rainbow Six: Siege player ""Shaiiko.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVz2UzhGsFQ) and I'd hate to see it happen to someone as positive for the community as Worrun is for EFT."

The fact this guy thinks he ""cracked the code"" when people who are literally paid to do it found no damning evidence (because neither flusha nor anyone he ever suspected of cheating have been banned yet, to my knowledge) makes me suspect that he's just affected by confirmation bias (he believes it, and finds evidence to support his claim, disregarding all other evidence that does not - not at all how you should go about testing a hypothesis). Either way, take what you will from his video.

* Step 0: Install Chrome if you don't have it, then go [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ban-checker-for-steam/canbadmphamemnmdfngmcabnjmjgaiki?hl=en) and install the Ban Checker for Steam Chrome Extension  
* Step 1: Go to https://www.steamcommunity.com and log in to your account, and go to your account's main page - should be steamcommunity.com/profile/1234546789 (or /id/insertnamehere if you have a custom URL set up).  
* Step 2: Add  /gcpd/730?tab=matchhistorycompetitive  to the end of your profile URL *while logged in* (only you can see this information so you have to be logged in to view it)  
* Step 3: Click ""Load whole match history"" and be prepared to wait a while, as it loads matches 8 at a time.  
* Step 4: Click ""Check loaded matches for bans""

> Would you be able to save up a fair amount of money? And can I ask what degree you have and where you went for Uni?:)  

Can't really save money, any money I save has to go to my loans as a condition of my living with my parents. I'm pretty financially irresponsible, as I've mentioned before with the car and the women. I also buy a ton of gaming stuff (hardware and software), and eat out once a week as well.  

I don't have a degree, I dropped out after 2 years from a Game Programming 3-year diploma program. One of the teachers, who works in the industry, said that weekly hours would likely be 60 normally and up to 100 during crunch. I was already struggling to not commit suicide with 15-20 hours of classes, 5-10 hours of homework, and 20-ish hours of work every week. I'm also the least creative person you'll ever meet, and having to make an entire game from scratch/my own ideas *on top of* regular class workload and part-time work was way too much to handle, so I stopped going part-way through Semester #4 (of 6). I tried uni but stopped going after a month also (but paid for 2 semesters like an idiot). The LAN parties were fun, though.  

> Have you ever considered doing like a “life-changing” action? Like saving up as much money as you can and move to Asia?  

I've considered it but there's a few things stopping me. One, I'm fairly certain I have 0 street smarts. I can't even get around Toronto without getting lost, let alone a completely foreign country. Two, I don't speak any  languages other than English and sucked when trying to learn French and Spanish in school. It'd be hypocritical of me to try to get by in any foreign country without learning their language, and moving to a primarily-English speaking country would likely defeat the purpose (and as it stands, is typically extremely difficult to do as most English-speaking countries have a long waiting period for immigrants, especially those that don't have work visas already lined up).  

Basically, there'd be no point because I'd just be setting myself up for instant failure and death anyway. No point stressing myself out even more by taking a 20+ hour plane ride to the middle of nowhere, just to get lost and stabbed to death in a random alley somewhere before the day is over.

Games,fnlftzm,t3_g1srck,1587052807.0,"Any ARPGs similar to Diablo 3? Things I've been looking for in an ARPG and can't quite find:  

* Quick to get to somewhat-endgame content (Diablo 3 takes me about 20-30 hours to get a rough draft of an end-game build that can push GR100+, specifically only 3-4 hours to hit max level - perfect for me).  
* Can switch to a completely different build on the fly. All active skills, passive skills, and equipment modifications can be changed at (pretty much) any time. Love being able to play my Wizard as an elemental meteor thrower, then swap to an Elemental God (Archon) blasting waves of destruction out at enemies, ending a session as a control Wizard who summons time-warping bubbles and throws ice balls at any enemy caught inside. The reason I don't play PoE is because each character you make is basically cemented into a specific build from the moment you create them, as resetting your entire wheel is extremely expensive. I also don't really care to sink hundreds of hours into the game for one character to get to end-game, and learning the extremely complex currency system gave me a headache when I tried.  

* Would love to have a bit more build diversity for each class. Demon Hunter is my favourite class in Diablo because there are so many different ways to play it and they each feel diverse. Example: Place sentries all over the place and have *them* fire your abilities. Another build has you firing massive arcs of arrows at anything that moves, dashing around the place to dodge damage. Yet another has you playing up close and personal on the most powerful monsters, throwing daggers in their face and running circles around trash as the embodiment of Shadows. WD builds, on the other hand, all play very similarly by grouping enemies in with a specific skill, then blasting the mobs with whatever burst-y damage skill you're using. This is what initially drew me to PoE because of the crazy diversity in build archetypes.  

* Mature setting. Torchlight was pretty good in both the first two aspects but the more goofy setting and aesthetic turned me off slightly, and the fact that there were just an insane number of stats and each item didn't really affect a specific skill and instead just boosted your character finished the job.  

Games I've heard of but haven't done a tonne of research into include Grim Dawn, Incredible Van Helsing (I and II), and Wolcen. Are any of these going to impress me with these systems or are they missing a key component listed above? Any other suggestions  obviously welcome."
Games,fnle8bf,t1_fnj6bez,1587052004.0,"If you have Steam, and some games that support local/split-screen multiplayer, doing ""Remote Play Anywhere"" is actually quite simple and effective. Only one person needs to own the game, and you're effectively streaming the gameplay to other player(s?) where they can control their own character through the stream. It's not as finnicky as it sounds, input lag is barely noticeable except for the most intense/fast-paced of titles.  

Some free games you can play with larger groups include Cards against Humanity (there's a popular free one that I can't recall the name of, just search Cards against Humanity online), StarCraft 2: Arcade (I think this is still free-to-play and has a lot of wacky modes including a Mafia mod now that Town of Salem isn't free-to-play), Draw Something or iSketch, and tons of free multiplayer games on sites like Miniclip."
Games,fnldm0n,t1_fnk7k5z,1587051689.0,"Not exactly Groovy Funk but definitely ""positive energy vibes"" - Celeste. Easily my favourite platformer from the past 5 years, main campaign isn't super difficult but playing through ""B-sides"" and ""C-sides"" to the levels (to unlock these you have to find ""tapes"" on the main levels) can be challenging. Story is incredibly moving and the soundtrack is beautiful."
Games,fnld922,t1_fnkuc3t,1587051504.0,The first one is also worth playing and follows this same format.
Games,fnld5qr,t1_fnlb6bv,1587051454.0,"The newest Modern Warfare fits this bill nicely, I'm pretty sure. The only thing I'm not sure of is the first point, but I'm almost 100% certain all guns, perks, and streaks are unlocked in custom games. You can still unlock skins and attachments for the guns and it is separate from matchmade multiplayer progression. Unsure what you mean by no progression - unless all 4 points are separate? If separate, then the last point definitely relates to most arena shooters. Reflex and the in-development UT4 are both quite good intros to the genre. Screencheat is pretty fun with friends too, even if graphics are a bit dated."
EscapefromTarkov,fnlbais,t1_fnl6uxd,1587050487.0,"Just my thoughts on counters to the potential issues you put forth:  

&nbsp;  

* Creating a game's mechanics with cheaters in mind isn't the way to go about it, IMO. Try to find a way to block cheaters from accessing this is moreso. Your idea for ""found in raid only items"" is OK but this would mean any loot from kills would be untransferrable which isn't ideal. I'd suggest a limitation on IP or HWID so the cheater can't run two instances on the same PC (which they can't right now anyway without a VM and/or VPN). Getting a second PC to run the game is outside of the scope of most cheaters and wouldn't be worth it. Most ""career cheaters"" are selling currency on third-party websites anyway and I don't see how this would increase the frequency of that happening.  

* BSG have stated time and again that this game will always be developed with Squads as the main way to play the game. With the incoming Karma system this will be even more evident. Solo should and always will be the most difficult way to play the game (in BSG's development goals). Honestly, I'm expecting the limit on number of players in a squad to *increase*, not decrease - likely to ""half the max on any given map"" (which means it would decrease on Factory and increase on every other map if memory serves). So while your opinion might differ, and that's fine, continue playing Tarkov as a solo player at your own peril. It's only going to get more OP for Squads as time goes on, regardless of your opinion.  

* Any time a player extracts from a raid, they are given a choice to send any of the items they didn't bring into the raid with them to any of their squad mates. Easiest way to do this would be through the already-existing mail system in the game. So if you extract early, your teammates will have the gear you sent them when they die or extract. If you die early, you'll have to wait for your teammates to extract, at which point the mail would come to you.  

* Ideally, it would be on an individual by individual basis. So if you designate one player as ""the hoarder,"" they could just as easily decide to fuck you and keep everything for themselves. When each player extracts, they can decide to send any items they want to any of their squad mates. It would just be a convenience feature for squads that trust each other and reward teamwork over back-stabbing."

They aren't typically (re)sellers of PPE, unsure how they came across this supply in the first place as typically they are a packaging supply company. Thanks for the info, though - makes me feel better about it."
ontario,fnktkyi,t1_fnktb2k,1587039561.0,"Unfortunately I don't really have the authority to reach out to them for more information (I'm just our Customer Service rep) just happened to be CC'd on a blanket e-mail offering KN95, Hand Sanitizer, Thermometers and Face Shields. Never seen the ""K"" in front of the mask designation before so wasn't sure if that meant non-medical or medical-grade masks. If you can't tell without the documentation I guess I'll just leave it alone. Thanks for the offer though!"
