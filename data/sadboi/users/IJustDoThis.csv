AskReddit,fbq95d1,t3_ee2ps8,1577029506.0,"My earliest memory was when I was about 3 years old. My Dad, mom, brother and me were in our car on the way to put down my dog. It was my moms dog and she loved him dearly. We got to the vet and my mom and dad went inside but my brother and I were too young so we stayed in the car. My parents came back and we went home. I remember later that day outside my mom was sobbing while smoking a cig. 
So yeah fun happy times."

mentalhealth,f6xsouv,t3_dtkbxy,1573257421.0,"Yeah I’ve been there and felt the way you have. It’s easy to watch the world pass by as a bystander. What got me out of bed was being creative, art, picture taking, doodles, etc. And even if you don’t think that’s worth getting out of bed don’t forget about food or making plans with friends or going on a walk or whatever that makes you happy or feel something. I hope this helps, take good care and you’re not alone 💖"
