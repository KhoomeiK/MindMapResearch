I would kinda but not really understand this from a 11yr old but man I know you may have a midlife crisis or something but get something better to do on your free time. What do you even get out of this? Do you get plesure from hurting already hurt people and may even make them commit suicide? Does it feel good to go to sleep every night and think ‚Äùoh yeah, I told that person to commit suicide and that person that they are worthless? I think you either need professional help for this or to get a job or a hobbie.
