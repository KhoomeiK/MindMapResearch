bipolar2,fq7rvec,t1_fq7qbcq,1589150939.0,I have an appointment with a new one a month from today. She has good reviews and now I know what I want and what I need so maybe I will be able to start off better with this one.
bipolar2,fq7rlss,t1_fq7qjp5,1589150786.0,"Omg. My primary care asked me one time when my anxiety was very bad “what is there to be worried about? Life is good.” I was gonna break down right there. I wanted to run away but of course I just sat there and had this “are you f***ng kidding me” look on my face. Like if someone tells you they have a problem and it’s causing them distress, who are you to tell them they don’t? I thought mental illness was becoming widely accepted throughout the entire medical field."
StudentNurse,fq7kz3s,t1_fq6xkjb,1589147779.0,Honestly I would probably just ask one of my professors when the time comes. It’s a long way from now. I’m just happy to hear it’s possible
bipolar2,fq6len2,t1_fq6l5zg,1589133771.0,"I’ve been getting my full 8 hours for the most part despite going to bed so early in the morning. My old psych tried to appropriate a lot of my symptoms and said if there was actually something to be worried about, I wouldn’t be getting the full 8 hours"
bipolar2,fq6cuw8,t1_fq6aj91,1589129062.0,"I took a regular .25 mg Xanax at night for 3 nights in a row and the first night it helped but not after that, which is pretty discouraging"
bipolar2,fq6cnrl,t1_fq5y5m1,1589128953.0,Wtf I bet that was disturbing to hear coming from a doctor
bipolar2,fq5kuqs,t1_fq5ksmx,1589109236.0,Yep it’s an awkward combo
bipolar2,fq5gyr8,t1_fq5d80t,1589105021.0,Are you depressed when you wake up in the “morning” ?
bipolar2,fq5gx20,t1_fq5fd9d,1589104968.0,Yeah something like that. I still feel like there’s something I could do to help myself
bipolar2,fq5ct6d,t1_fq5cnna,1589100487.0,I will admit I rarely exercise. But I don’t think that’s the sole reason I stayed up past sunrise yesterday.
StudentNurse,fpxr52c,t1_fpxqs0m,1588987893.0,The only thing that could possibly make that better was if it said “sent from my iPhone” 🤦🏻‍♀️
StudentNurse,fpxp3wr,t1_fpxo58y,1588986758.0,Seriously!? I think my current CC in California is trying to do a bridge program with them right now! Scary 😬😂
StudentNurse,fpxo24d,t1_fpxnrkj,1588986191.0,Thanks! It’s funny you say that because my dad heard a commercial for GCU and he was like “is that one of those fake schools that takes your money and then shuts down before you can graduate?” He was being humorous of course but yeah I totally get what you’re saying. I’m glad to hear I’ll be able to do my work online when the time comes because I would love to be up and working!
CSUS,fpt1sbg,t3_gfd9c4,1588883372.0,"I’m sure it does because everyone has to take it to transfer in as a 3rd year or for GE completion which is what CCs are generally for. Assist should tell you, though. To answer your question, my POLSCI 1 at Delta is transferable to Sac."
mentalhealth,fpbb5l7,t3_gc2eqz,1588466040.0,"In a way, you might feel threatened by them because they are spreading an illness and ignorant to the fact that they are doing so. An illness that is killing many people rather quickly. There’s nothing wrong with you for feeling that way, you are just very passionate and don’t want to put up with their BS. I think having those thoughts are completely different than actually executing an act of violence and since you were asking if there is something wrong with you, I don’t think you’re the type of person to actually act out in a violent manner."
mentalillness,fpbab3s,t3_gcfuv0,1588465509.0,Awesome! I know how hard it can be. It’s nice to be able to celebrate the little things every once in a while. Set the same goal for tomorrow :)
mentalillness,fpb7v40,t3_gcbbjq,1588463976.0,"You seem like a very thoughtful, intelligent person. I can tell because you’re critically thinking and analyzing life in ways that many people wouldn’t. 
That’s also why you’re posting on a mental illness sub. You to know deep down your justification for suicide is coming from an illness and that EVERYONE has something to contribute to life. What would you tell a distraught stranger who also feels like they should die because of the way they feel? I don’t know you, but seeing as you appear to be intelligent and thoughtful as I said before, I think you would probably relate to them, but ultimately give them a reason why they matter or how they make a contribution to the world. I know depression sometimes has a mood-dependent effect on memories, but if you can, try to think back to a time that you didn’t feel this way. Where were you? What were you doing? Were you with people or alone? Any single moment where you felt like “someone.” Now just think, you’re literally that same person today, just with an illness. An illness that all of us here know that has symptoms that fluctuate. We all have the ability to bounce back, and when we do, it’s a great feeling. Even if it’s just to eventually become depressed again. But if you aren’t here, you won’t be able to experience all that. The world might be much bigger than us, thus making our existence seem irrelevant, but you only know what you have seen. If existing feels so wrong and nonsensical, you might just need a change of scenery. I didn’t want to make this about me, but I was feeling similar to the way you are and I moved to a different city. Moving comes with its own challenges and anxieties, but let me tell you, it’s one of the best decisions I’ve made. Good luck to you, you deserve it."
CSUS,fpav4ci,t1_fp909v5,1588456340.0,Thanks we’ll look into it!
bipolar2,fpav0lv,t1_fpauo4u,1588456278.0,We got one for our old boy cat and he was obsessed with it. He would actually drink too much because it was “fun” for him. He coughed sometimes so we took it away 🤣
bipolar2,fpatfkf,t3_gcb4lc,1588455340.0,"Irritability sucks because I know I’m being awful and it’s like I can’t escape it. 

But I would say the WORST is that awkward combination of anxiety/depression/paranoia/guilt that comes crashing down. It usually starts with depression and then I start doubting my relationships and value in other people’s lives which sometimes leads to paranoia. But then the doubt makes me feel incredibly guilty because it’s like I’m literally being such a nuisance to people who love me and then there’s the fear and anxiety that they will want nothing to do with me if I keep it up. 

It really is a lovely cluster."
bipolar2,fpasc7c,t3_gc0ru3,1588454692.0,Awesome! Is that a cat fountain I see?
catproblems,fp3t9y0,t1_fp2qj7s,1588285396.0,"I agree he could just be a rambunctious kitten since he technically is still a baby. He’s just very large so it’s off-putting. He’s also getting fat so I’m working on switching him to adult lower cal food and I just got a laser pointer today and a cat tree is on the way. I would say I play with him enough, but his interests still seem to be biting skin rather than chasing toys. He will have his moments where he’s into the toys, but then he will see my foot move and attack it instead. Thanks for the advice, I needed it since literally everyone says I have the weirdest, most insane cat they’ve ever seen (and we are all cat people!)"
Physiology,fp1hc0w,t1_foywzqq,1588235545.0,"Not to discredit Sammie, but that is extremely unlikely for anyone of any age, not to mention a 19-year-old. I have actually experienced the feeling you are talking about and it's muscle twitches. It could be positional or due to lack of hydration. I think you'll be just fine! If anything really starts to worry you though, by all means, go talk to your doctor. However,as a general rule of thumb, if there's no pain, lightheadedness,or shortness of breath, it's almost always gastric or muscular."
bipolar2,fp0a8jv,t3_gafdgb,1588205400.0,Oh ok so this is normal.. nice. Sorry y’all have to go through this too. I thought it was just me lol
mentalillness,forigdf,t1_fori4ne,1588012783.0,"I understand that for sure. I had a very intrusive friend back in high school when I was struggling a lot. I didn’t appreciate her stepping directly into my problems, but she supposedly meant well. I could handle that, but what I couldn’t handle was the fact that she got my best friend involved. It made me feel very ambushed because like you, I didn’t even try to get help of any form on my own. I was basically a kid still. So I get what you’re saying."
mentalillness,forhhf0,t1_fooz62y,1588012311.0,"I agree. Nobody wants to hear someone else’s opinion on their own mental health unless they ASK for it. Over all, she seems to be a caring friend, but she could work on the delivery of her message. But then again, “battling depression” isn’t easy to do alone so I hope OP isn’t hung up on that part ! A little help is almost always needed; for myself included."
bipolar2,fopxmsp,t1_fom79tl,1587975601.0,"I can’t stand being asked to rate my mood. During my appointments I couldn’t help but thinking “this is what I’m paying you for??” Lol so I started tracking on my own too and some of the pages are fuuuulllll but what can I say, a lot happens in a day"
bipolar2,fomlcn4,t3_g87oas,1587894379.0,Yes omg I didn’t think anything of it till now. I’ll get all emotional thinking about how great my bf is or how I have so many people that care about me. It’s actually a really nice feeling.... before it decides it’s over sigh
diamondpainting,folrr8f,t3_g818li,1587868938.0,That’s pretty detailed for a smaller one. I have my first one on the way and it’s the same size and I was worried about how it would look. I like it a lot!
bipolar2,foljct3,t1_folinct,1587863483.0,Omg I know he would have me rate my overall mood and I’m like dude i haven’t seen you in 2 months I cannot just give you a number.

bipolar2,folhqpm,t1_folguxz,1587862487.0,Welllll I had it when I was 2 which I know is very young but it’s kind of worn off now. Now and then I’ll get super compulsive like a few months ago I couldn’t stop picking at my face and it got really bad

It was probably a huge waste of time but it gave me something to safely obsess over and occupy myself with and it was functional as a check list after the fact. 

I don’t use it anymore though. Lately I’ve been using either a spiral notebook, comp book, or even a small binder to make lists and keep track of things. Like I have one little binder that I write down all my expenses in (mostly for tax purposes) and I have another one I make lists on for moving (what I need, what places I want to check out, etc). I like it because each idea can have its own page and having a small stack of notebooks is kind of satisfying because you can look at it like “wow I’m organized for once” lol."

bipolar2,fnaoch8,t1_fna0sw8,1586800962.0,"Thanks. I think it would be a good idea to start one of these because because my current doctor asks me to rate my mood 1-10, worst to best, and it kills me because I’m like, “which day are we talking about?” Haha thanks for the tip."

It was weird to me because a couple months ago I had an appointment with him and he started subtly asking more questions about my sleep and whatnot as if he was considering it. I just think the bottom line is that I need a doctor who I feel is less dismissive in general. I know it’s not always their job to be a therapist, but I’ve literally had him tell me he can’t help me with certain aspects of my condition because he doesn’t have a lot of experience (it was a simple anxiety/OCD skin picking problem).

nutrition,fm4yfib,t3_ft3b2h,1585763035.0,"I have found that people have these fears when it comes to certain foods or ingredients, white flour being one. In my opinion, it is always beneficial to have protein in your meal because, yes, it helps slow the release of sugar into your blood stream, hence the less dramatic spike in blood sugar. Some may say it’s good to have equal amounts, but this is really only the case for diabetics. The normal person with no health issues should be mindful, but not fear carbs. It’s all about balance, but not a perfect balance if ya know what I mean. To conclude, I think adding protein to bread is a good idea."
nursing,fltdajf,t1_fltd2h5,1585468011.0,You got a lot of reasons why things can and will work out for you and they really do become apparent once you put yourself out there.

I hope you’re right and it’s a good fit for me !
nursing,flt2cls,t3_fqn5zw,1585457171.0,"While I am not in the field yet, I too have stopped taking anxiety meds right before the virus outbreak and I’m currently on Wellbutrin, which is sufficient under normal circumstances. This outbreak has hit me pretty hard and I don’t wanna say I’m “getting used to it,” but for us with anxiety issues, it’s very difficult to gain strength to push through, so we either succumb to the stress, or become numb (used to it). 
Either way, this is not okay. You’re in a profession where you put everyone first on a daily basis. Now that you’re in a position where both your physical and mental health are at risk, you need to put yourself first for at least a little bit. Make the appointment, keep reaching out to someone till you get the help you need. Just contacting your doctor could very likely help you feel better. For me, it gives me hope. Because when I was in low places before, I know I only got through it by taking the first little steps. Those little steps can do big things for your mental health. 
You are a nurse, protect yourself how you were trained to do so, and don’t let the fear of contracting the disease stop you ESPECIALLY since soooo many doctors are offering online consults, just like others have said. You got this!!  
This doesn’t compare to being in the middle of an incredibly stressful job, but I’m in college and my classes got moved online. I had so many things I needed to do that required me to speak with financial aid, counselors, etc. I was completely discouraged and thought for sure that this would hold me back from my plan to transfer soon. My dad (bless him) was actually the one to tell me to keep emailing people until I got the help I needed. To my surprise, my school’s staff answered extremely promptly and lo and behold, I got the help I needed. I’m still taking it day by day, but I did something so small and seemingly insignificant and it made all the difference. You are so much stronger than your anxiety and you know it. There’s nothing wrong with needing a little help :)"
