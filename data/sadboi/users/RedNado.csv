TMJ,fmqizql,t3_fwqmhz,1586300539.0,"If I may add in, besides foods, don't forget to try some jaw stretching if you're in a place where you can.  
I know some have it worse with popping/clicking/pain/dizziness and such with their tmj though, so never over do yourself and listen to your body.  


But my jaw got really tense over this past month, and I realized that it was because I wasn't using my jaw as I normally do.  
I wasn't having scheduled meals, I wasn't chewing as much and I wasn't talking as much compared to when I was at work, to now being stuck at home.  


Just saying that some extra pain and tension could be from lack of movement in the jaw/neck shoulder muscles.  
Regular stretching of the face/jaw/neck/ and whole body honestly, is really important.

curlyhair,fmqhxar,t1_fmntld7,1586299945.0,"My hair was dry... everywhere lol   


The shampoo could be causing your scalp to be dries also, since it strips  away good and bad oils, as well as dirt and such.  
It is still good to cleanse the scalp, you can use apple cider vinegar mixed with water (apply, scrub in, rinse out, and the condition) , I used to do it a lot, maybe twice a month, and it adds a nice shine to your hair.  
But, even though it's not strict curly girl, I did go back to shampooing my hair once a month or so, and have been doing that for the past two months.  
It just works for me and it's also nice to not be super strict lol  


I used Johnson and Johnson baby shampoo that I have had at home!  
You can do a quick google search and see what other shampoos are good for a final wash, you do want one that has sulfates and such to remove any build up that may be in your hair from your current products.  
I recommend adding a few Curly Girl groups on facebook too! I learned eveerrryythiiinngg through the groups and it's really nice to see other's results and what works best for them!   
Then it's all down to trail and error with your products, drying techniques, refreshing techniques, and whatnot!  


When you start, I would do a moisture treatment! (I don't know a specific one in mind because I haven't done one in a while myself. My hair hasn't been dry and frizzy like it used to be before I started, thanks to the use of moisturizing conditioners!)  
But you can search for a CG approved moisture treatment and use that at your roots only, or over all of your hair. It will help instantly add in moisture.  
You may find you like to do that once a month, maybe more, maybe less! Depending how your hair reacts when you start and continue.  


There are protein treatments you can do as well, if you notice your hair seeming dull, not as curly anymore. My hair will look kinda flat and will not keep it's curl as well as it normally would.  
I then do a CG approved protein treatment and it bounces my hair right back!   
I've done gelatin treatments so far,  maybe every other month to once a month, and added in a nice protein conditioner I use everyday. Which I buy a big bottle of at.... \*drum roll\* The dollar store! You can fine good priced products that work for you. People think the CG method is hard to do and expensive, it's really not, not after the 'adjusting period' I mentioned before.  
You do want to find a good balance of protein/moisture within your everyday products to help your hair stay balanced. Again, that's another trial and error thing and you'll figure that out over time!  


I would do a moisture treatment right away, but I wouldn't do a protein treatment yet. Wait and see how your hair reacts for maybe two weeks or so, if it seems lifeless/not curling well/flatter than normal, then I would give a protein treatment a try.  
You can overdo protein and your hair will take longer to bounce back from that, which is why I suggest waiting on that one.  


If you hair gets too much moisture, it's not as big of a deal because that will balance itself out easier, unlike having too much protein in your hair.  


I'm happy to share everything!!  
I struggled a lot when I first started and it was because I wasn't asking questions and paying enough attention to how my hair reacted. I got very frustrated and I shouldn't have lol!  
It can seem overwhelming when figuring out products, and how your hair reacts to being styled/dried certain ways. I wish there was one way that worked for everyone, but sadly there isn't.  
It really is about sticking with it and just trying new things and ways!  


Don't start off with a million products and don't use a lot of heavy products right away, they can weight your hair down and cause a lot of build up.  


I would start with two CG approved conditioners, one that does contain a protein, and one that doesn't, and use the lighter/liquidier one to cowash with like you would shampoo (I like Vo5 conditioners for cowashing!)  
Then find a cg approved gel (LA Looks works amazing for me, and has protein)  
and see how your hair reacts to those for a few weeks before adding in, or trying a new product.  
Don't go and change ALL your products at the same time either, I was guilty of doing this because I really wanted to TRY EVEERYYTHINNGG!  
But by doing that I lost the products that my hair DID like... and started using things randomly instead of giving my hair time to adjust to products first.  
Swap out one product for a different one, one at a time, so you can see how your hair reacts to it and without the one you cut out.  
Then you know slowly what works and what doesn't, use what feels good and holds well in your hair!

There are a ton of approved conditioners/mousse's/curl creams/leave in conditioners/gels that you'll be able to find.   
Limit yourself to a few to start with and fight the urge to try everything all within your first two months lol  


Don't be like meeeee!"

curlyhair,fmnm5bb,t1_fmnbek8,1586229316.0,"My goal was to wash my hair less also. 
I was doing the same as you, shampooing/conditioning everyday, or at least every other. 

I heard about curl girl method a little over a year ago and really wanted to give it a try. 
I've always had issues with my hair being frizzy/unruly. I straightened my hair religiously for about two years in high school, and never took great care of it, not like I do now.

I simply started by doing a final cleanse with a shampoo that would wash out any silicone and such that may have been in the products I used. 
Then from there I didn't shampoo my hair again. 

That sounds like such a big thing but my hair stopped being oily and dry constantly after I stopped using shampoo. (My hair did get more oily when I first started, there is a period when you start that your hair goes through a reset period. And because I wasn't washing everyday, for the first two weeks or so,  my hair felt worse than ever to me. But it was just adjusting to not using shampoo. That phase passes but can last longer to others. Everyone is different!) 
I used CG approved conditioners (there are a TON!) from then on out. 
I wash my hair with conditioner, I like to use a thinner one, and scrub only your head with it like you would when shampooing. 
Then I used a more moisturizing conditioner after and let sit in my hair a bit. 

I comb my hair only while in the shower, loaded with the conditioner. I don't comb my hair at all, ever, except that one time in the shower each week. 

By not brushing your hair dry/at all,  it helps to train your hair to stay in your natural curls, instead of you brushing hair constantly... Which I also used to do, and letting that disrupt your curls that are there.

By stopping the habit of brushing my hair, it led to so much less frizz and breakage.

My hair just looked and felt better overall after doing all this. 

I do use shampoo maybe once a month now, just to cleanse my hair well once in a while.
But besides that, I use conditioner only,  and cg approved gels, finger comb in the shower only, and that's about it. 

I don't feel the need to wash it more because it doesn't feel oily like it used to, and reacts better to not being washed constantly. 

Since I don't break up my curls by brushing anymore, they stay formed really well and dont need redoing/brushing. 
I do go about 2/3 days without it putting it up, but I do put my hair up a lot toward  the end of my week before I'm about to wash my hair again. 
I will wash once every 4-7 days,  depending how dirty my hair gets. 

When it comes to styling, I will make sure to sleep with my hair not syled, no ponytail or anything. Then the next morning I will rewet my hair with water and conditioner mixed in my hands. 
Still not breaking up the curls/no combing. Just applying gently into my hair/curls, avoiding the scalp to prevent build up in the roots. (That also really helps to not have to wask everyday, avoid applying a ton of product right in the roots.)
And let it air dry without touching it. 

You can do refreshes like that during the week, instead of washing fully again. You are using the products that are already in your hair to reactivate them with water, and you can add in a bit more product (conditioner, or gels. Gel is your best friend to prevent frizz/breakage ) when needed. 
But refreshes help your hair bounce back from styling and not washing your hair instead. You can fully resoak your hair in the shower if you wanted, adding in more gel, or a bit more conditoner, while in the shower.
Still no brushing/washing scalp.
Dry again, without touching your hair and breaking the curls up still. (Truly the hardest part lol!)

Doing refreshes helps with prolonging your hair until you want to wash again. 
Some people naturally need to wash their hair more, and their hair reacts great to it! 
Others can fo longer between washes. 

It depends on how your hair and body/oils work, it's different for everyone, so you really just have to do a trial and error test and see what works for you. 
Same with the products that you use. 
One persons favorite 'holy grail ' of products may not work for you and could be awful for your hair. Some peoples hair like coconut product, others have issues with it and don't like how it makes their hair look/feel compared to other products.

curlyhair,fmn9gk8,t1_fmn93dp,1586221034.0,"Also, to add, long hair has weight to it. The top of my head is definately flatter/less volume when my hair is really long, because the weight of the hair pulls the hair away from the scalp. Thus making it sometimes look like I may have less hair/less volume.
So its also normal to notice less volume as your hair gets long!
I counteract that by diffusing upside down/apply products upside down.
Long wavy hair + gravity = no volume at the roots for me lol 

Just something to think about too!"
curlyhair,fmn93dp,t3_fwak24,1586220806.0,"I have hair down to my butt... The amount of hair I fingercomb out in the shower is RIDICULOUS. 
soooo much hair. 
But I don't feel like I'm losing hair more than normal. 

Think about your routine as well as the length of your hair. 
I don't comb or brush my hair outside of the shower, ever. 
So,  that means I'm not brushing out the hair that is naturally shedding out. That stays in the hair until it's fingercombed (with conditioner/water) in the shower,  once per week for me. 
Plus the length of hair itself. 

I comb out a good weeks worth of shedded hair, once a week, in the shower. 
That's it. 
So that's why it seems like SOOO MUCH HAIR that I'm combing out hahha


As long as you aren't noticing thinning hair, thin or bald spots, or breakage at your crown, it's most likely just you naturally shedding and the length of your hair.
The less you brush it during the day/week is best (for me anyway) so if youre not brushing it a lot, that hair isnt shedding out during the week/days and is coming out during your shower instead.

Do what you need to to feel healthy and grounded! You shouldn't have to compromise everything that you enjoy, that keeps you active, especially during this time.  


Are you able to leave your house? Go out for a walk, and go stretch.workout outside if you can. Or go running, even if it's not something you usually do, it's a different alternative to staying active if you don't have a lot of options right now.  


Same with the food, are you able to go to the store yourself? Try to go pick up fresh food and things that you need. Food is a very important part of it all.

It is in the strong running to be added into the Olympics as well.

The beams should be fine!
But before putting up a pole, you want to have a stud finder handy to actually find the beams, where it starts and finishes, so you know you are placing it directly on the beam. If you don't put it on a support beam that is when you run the risk of it pushing through the drywall of your ceiling. 
The instructions that come with the pole will state that and show you also, as well as YouTube videos (which were a bit help when first learning to set up and take down the pole for the first few times.) 
But those ceilings should be safe after you find the correct spot with the beam!

poledancing,fm90zh0,t3_ftmzwu,1585859668.0,"I've had my xpole pert for ten years now, and have had it set up (and taken down) many many times between two different apartments in that time.  
I've never had a single issue with any damage at all.  
The only thing that was noticeable when I took the pole down was a faint ring of color where the dome was resting on the ceiling... which was easily cleaned with a soapy rag and water.  
You couldn't tell I even had a pole up.  
I've never had popcorn ceilings, so don't know how it holds  up with them.  


My current house doesn't have a spare room where I can have my own pole space, so it has been put up and taken down a million times in my living room. You wouldn't even be able to tell I had one!  


I'm glad I don't have a horror story to share, maybe that is one way to convince him!  
( I did have a mishap where I did a spin and the pole shifted sideways, that is the only issue I've ever had and it was because I hadn't checked and tightened the pole in a while. Which is something you should check for before a poling session. That was totally user error and it's never happened again. Even with the pole shifting sideways, still no damage to my ceiling, or floor.)  
Though I had ordered my pole while I still lived at home with my parents (already knowing I was moving out the next month) and I was told they didn't want it in the house.  
A few weeks was an easy wait, but they both saw there was no damage after I moved out of my apartment years later. I lived in my apartment and had the pole in the same spot for about 3-4 years. Same with the house I live in now!  


Watch installation videos and as long as you are properly putting it up, and re-tightening/testing the pole before sessions from time to time, you should have no issues!  
Some people even put up a thin piece of wood in between the dome of the pole and their ceilings, so that there is a layer of extra protection between.  
Maybe that would make him feel better to look into? I've never done that myself though, and would feel comfortable putting the pole up anywhere!"

I have always had the pole in the living room since I moved in with my fiancee about 4 years ago or so.  
I have an xpole xpert and it's pretty easy to put up and take down!  
The main thing is to make sure you find the beam in the ceiling and always set the pole up on the same spot on the ceiling (As well as making sure the pole is completely straight as well)  
I actually traced the dome of the top of my pole with a pencil after I had put it up in the living room, so that when I did take it down, I knew the exact spot to put it back up at. You really don't notice the light pencil line either, when the pole it down.  


Though I rarely take my pole down, only if we have many guests coming over, but usually not even then.  
I have no issues taking it down and putting it up though, after you do it a few times, you get pretty quick with it.   


Is there any way you can ask your roommates and see if maybe they'd like to have a pole night with you?

Those dont do well in closed terrariums because they don't like a lot of moisture. They like to be drier and not watered often, otherwise they will start to rot on you. 
Moss on the other hand loves moisture, so they are a hard combo of plants to keep together since they like opposite conditions. 
Or keep the succulent in and see how it does! 

The other plant, the taller green one, will do much better in there than the succulent.
But its beautiful!

For a closed terrarium, I would only water after it seems to dry, and when there isnt any moisture on the inside of the glass.

Keep some in your work bag, or stow a tiny bottle away in the bathroom, or a workstation you frequent, if you can.   
I try to gently file off/down any bumps and cracks after I get home, just to try to keep the nail itself looking nicer.  
I will buff callouses as needed, but I try to keep in mind that my hands also need those callouses for my work and so I don't have to build up protection on my hands over and over (From holding shoves/tools.)  


And my biggest thing, DRINK A LOT OF WATER!  
All day, every day. Aim to drink as much water as you can, as well as not skipping meals.  
It's really easy to forget to eat and drink when we have a job like we do lol   
I keep a bunch of healthy snacks in my bag and snack as often as I am able to, as well as drinking a lot of water.   
It makes such a difference in your skin and overall health.  


I wish you the best of luck, I know what you're going through!"

I used to do a lot of chat based RP years ago, and miss it!   
I'm a 29 year old female who is a big nature nerd.  
I've never played d&d, but I've been wanting to learn and have sat in on a few sessions of friends games/watched some youtube/Twitch games.  
I have an art background as well, and love creating things. Creating a character to play as sounds like so much fun, I used to do it for the chat based RP.  
 I don't have any created, because I honestly wasn't sure if I was allow to create a character before I actually found a game to play, or if they were created as a group/with the DM as we start. With my love of nature I feel like falling into a druid category would be fun, but I'm truly willing to play as anything!   
Although I do tend to be a bit shy at first, don't let that fool you, I love sarcasm and humor, but am also fine with being serious when it is needed.  


Keep me in mind for any games if they are noob friendly!  
I do have Discord as well.

Hello, helloooo! 
I would be interested in starting up something! 
I haven't rp'ed in a while, so as long as you don't mind me brushing up on my writing as we go, I'd love to join in. 

I'm not interested in romance/smut, but am open to different ideas/worlds/characters. I'm great with adapting. 

I would need to create an original character, as I don't currently have any created. I don't mind creating that on my own, or working together on any character ideas and creation. 

I'm a female who has almost always played as a female character, but have played a few different races/forms in the past. I've ranged from playing as a human (some with magickal abilities), both adult and child, vampire types, angelic type forms, and would be willing to create just about anything depending on the setting/atmosphere that is chosen. 
I've done a few characters in the past who don't even know what race they are, or who they are really. We with abilities forming/disappearing as the story goes on, and them having to wing it and figure it out, that's always been fun and pretty humorous to play. 
I'm up for anything!

Ginger is great for stomach issues/heartburn, get some ginger tea! I buy ginger root at the grocery store, grate a small amount, and put it into my tea, mixed with other tea/flavors!

There is no excuse to being mean ans nasty toward someone you love. 
When she's in a good frame of mind try to talk to her about it and how it makes you feel- and what you can both do better next time she has a moment like that. 
My partner and I talk about it a lot, When I start feeling overly emotional or irrational (and sometimes it's hard for me to see that in the moment) I will ask for time alone to relax and think about why I'm feeling that why... Instead of lashing out and just reacting. 
He never gave me space in the past when we would argue and I felt like it was an attack on me.  The more we talked about it the better understanding that we got. 
He let's me walk away when we get in a heated conversation, or if I'm feeling anxious/off about something and need space. Ive been pulling myself away from the issue so I dont lash out for no reason (or reasons I dont yet understand) so that I don't say hurtful things and can take time to think about why I'm feeling that way. 
Then we come back to the conversation after we have both relaxed and took time apart to think/relax. 

Be open, don't let her walk all over you, tell her that's not OK and you guys need a plan to follow when you both see a problem starting to happen. 
She needs to step back, take it down a level, and think about why she got heated and mean in the first place.

Gently shake off any dead/dry leaves, if it ends up looking bare, that's OK right now! 
You want to clean out any dead leaves so the plant stops giving energy to the dead ones, and starts to produce new leaves. 
If the tips of the branches are brown/dead, you can trim those also,  but yours look OK! 

I would get a granular fertilizer, Iuse one called Osmocote, and put some into the pot, then water well! 
If you have other fertilizer, like a liquid, at home that should be OK too (read the bottle) but I really love the granular (chunks) fertilizer because they are a slow release. They give a small about of nutrients to the plants each time you water, instead of one BIG feeding of the liquid. 
Just my preference.

Libido changes over time and because of hormones/stress/life. 
I go through phases of high/low as well. 
Half of the time I don't initiate, or even think about sex. My partner brings it up more often than I do, but he also leaves it alone when he knows I've been off or not open to it for a while.
Thats ok too! Everyone is different and has different sex drives.

Have you guys talked openly about it? Ask her if there is a reason that she doesn't want it. 
Ask if there are things that she would like to try in bed sometime, if she is into anything specific she may find fun. 
Same to you! Express your interest in wanting sex,  but don't push/force the issue, and let her know you're willing to try things, and willing to wait when she needs a break from it.
Don't be afraid to talk to her about it and see how she feels.

We got into a period where my partner and I were only doing it about once a month, for a few months. 
I was just feeling off and not myself, was stressed out and over thinking my everyday life. I pulled away from him. 
He brought it up to me and it wasn't something I even had in my mind, I felt bad and wasnt trying to frustrate him, or myself, sexually.
I love sex, but it's hard for me to shut off my head and focus sometimes (and not even just about sex)
Sex isnt something that comes to mind naturally, if that makes sense.

I told my partner to start texting me during the day when he may want sex later on, that way I KNOW he's ready and he can tease me throughout the day to get me thinking and excited for our time together later!
It works for me and keeps sex in the front of my mind during my day, so I'm expecting it and ready to go later lol
