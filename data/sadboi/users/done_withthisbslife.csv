I won the genetic lottery- financially well off, attractive and intelligent and I feel like shit when I see people who actually have issues with those things. I'm a spoilt cunt with my head up my ass and I can't even undo it because of the shitty chemical configuration of my brain. Fuck lol. What a waste of life to be born with these things and not even be able to appreciate them."
