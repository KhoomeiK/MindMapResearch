Now that I don‚Äôt have that employee discount, there‚Äôs no benefit for me buying physical. I was stupid hype for Control, had it pre ordered for months but I just went in and canceled it because there‚Äôs no tax on digital items and there was no benefit to getting it physically. Especially since I know I‚Äôm gonna love it. 

Without the pre order bonuses or collectors editions there is NO Benefit to pre ordering. But I‚Äôm sure corporates still going to get mad at you guys for not getting enough pre orders."

GameStop,ep641dm,t3_bu2nr4,1559064360.0,"Corporate doesn‚Äôt give two shits about you, they are so disconnected from the stores that they are running the business into the ground.

My manager ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt that bad‚Äù and he called out/left early almost every shift. Also his hours and time off were the only hours/time off that mattered. You could request time off months in advance and the guy would still schedule you for that day.

The customers, can be.  some of the most entitled, grosses, rudest people I‚Äôve ever met. I had a dude THROW a game at me because he didn‚Äôt like it and wanted his money back. THE DUDE THREW IT.

There‚Äôs this generalized hate for gamestop as a corporation and so a lot of the customers take that hate for gamestop and treat the employees like garbage even though the employees are getting treated poorly by corporate.

Almost 50% of the managers I had were alcoholics and I didn‚Äôt understand until recently. The job just wears you down emotionally."
GameStop,eoiupur,t3_bs40p3,1558627699.0,"My assistant manager and manager just got into an argument over this. My manager told the district leader that we weren‚Äôt comfortable doing that, we‚Äôre not in the best area etc. then our group store leader game in (I can‚Äôt stand that guy) and my manager completely flopped sides!

He holds his ground to the district mananger but this fucking tool who‚Äôs ‚ÄúGroup Store Leader‚Äù, whos technically not even a group store leader for our store, he just rolls over.

My assistant manager went off. Seems like the assistant managers the only one who cares about us. When I got a elite controller yanked from under me the first thing he asked was ‚Äúare you okay‚Äù while my manager instantly went to ‚Äúwas that the only thing taken? How did he grab it?‚Äù üòÇ dude fucking reached for me, I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm dropping the remote and keeping my self unharmed.

With shit like this gamestop is pushing away good employees. One of my old managers who was AMAZING, left, this is my last week at this hell hole. My other SGA who does all the work is leaving in a month or so. My assistant manager is thinking about leaving. But they promote people like my manager who calls out every shift he can.

I loved this company as a kid and it sucks to see how they treat there employees and how they are running themselves into the ground"
