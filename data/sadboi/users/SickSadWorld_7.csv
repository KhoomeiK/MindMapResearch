That could be a person with borderline, right? But it doesn't qualify on its own for a diagnosis. Because you need 5 borderline symptoms to know if someone has borderline, not one. 

1-4 symptoms doesn't count as enough for a borderline diagnosis. It's the same way with NPD. Someone can have symptoms without it being to the point of an actual disorder. And not everyone who *is* diagnosed matches the image of what we think a person with NPD like like.

It's not that there's no possibility of an underlying disorder. It's that we are not qualified to make a diagnosis. Even a licensed psychiatrist needs to give an evaluation before diagnosing someone."

We can be accepting and gentle about something without giving it a sugarcoated, cutesy name.

A lot of narcissism is a defense mechanism against childhood abuse, just like our behaviors. Sometimes people respond to constant emotional invalidation or abuse by developing an excessive ""Every criticism of me is wrong."" type perspective. Ironically, you're kinda doing that right now.

All of those things are reasons for him being an abusive, terrible person. But that's not what goes into diagnosing someone with NPD.

The other thing to consider is people outside the borderline community have the exact same misconceptions about all pwBPD being abusive, and armchair diagnosing awful people as having borderline. Hence part of the reason why people misdiagnose him as having BPD.

We know how harmful the stigma is to us, and we should use that understanding and empathy to *not* engage in the same stigmatizing behaviors that hurt us. Even if we believe ourselves to be right, we should try to be better than that."

It's more about expecting someone to meet certain needs that we should be learning to meet ourselves. For example, expecting them to regulate our emotions by going to them nearly every time something goes wrong or we feel bad. That's enabling because it's preventing the person from developing their own coping skills. I dunno if that relates or makes sense. It's good that you have these healthy activities and boundaries, but I really think you would be an exception from the rule, at least from my observations. Either way I value your perspective, and I think it's okay for different people to think different things."

I guess what I'm saying is while it feels unfair, it's also unfair to expect someone to prioritize you over their parents if that relationship is important to them. And especially if the reasons they might not approve are because the relationship seems emotionally harmful.

They probably don't want it to be an us or them situation in the first place.

People like to romanticize it and think things like ""oh I could go my whole life never speaking to anyone"". But it's way easier said than done and unless you've experienced that kind of isolation yourself you're going to be pretty clueless about what it's actually like. I'm introverted and liked the idea, but having no social connections or support did not help with the suicidal ideation.

That's not a general term for someone abusive, and unless they're diagnosed or you're a professional psychiatrist, you shouldn't be calling someone that.

All we can do is accept the things we now see as bad behavior, and try not to make the same mistakes going forward.

-Has difficulty initiating projects or doing things on their own (because of a lack of self confidence in judgment or abilities rather than a lack of motivation or energy).

The difference between a good person and a bad person is that one recognizes that their flaws or mistakes and tries to do better. The other just insists they're right now matter what."
BPD,faapfhg,t1_fa9slgr,1575911826.0,"True! But we also shouldn't be *creating* a culture where harmful behaviors are seen as totally fine instead of harmful. 

I mean like crying for 10 hours because your FP won't text you back, etc. 

In that example, it's unquestionably harmful. It made them cry for 10 hours."
BPD,faaoq9j,t1_faafwrg,1575911575.0,"I agree with most of that. I have met people IRL who said that their obsession with an FP was completely okay. This people also said that being physically abusive (in different words) is okay, and she just needs to find a partner that can handle it. It's messed up that some people have that degree of denial, but it does exist. I'm not friends with her anymore haha.

The thing about *we don't want to have this disorder* is that this isn't a diagnostic symptom of borderline, but we keep treating it like it is. It's common but it's not in the definition of borderline. In some cases, it's actually undiagnosed Dependent Personality Disorder. Which is frequently comorbid with BPD. But that's harder to consider or admit to yourself than having a favorite person."
BPD,faan1h0,t1_faactz8,1575910949.0,I dunno. I think it's just easier to say to yourself that someone is your favorite rather than an obsession. We could easily call it something more realistic or less sugarcoated. And it could easily be abbreviated like FP is.

BPD,faamc3j,t1_faaghv9,1575910683.0,How bout CR? Or any other abbreviation.
BPD,faam5tl,t1_faafjl7,1575910619.0,"Sorry if I haven't been coming off that way, but I'm not bashing anyone. Unless they're one of the people swearing at me in this thread for voicing a contrary opinion- which says a lot about the problem. My goal was just to get people thinking and talking."
BPD,faalc5u,t1_faal8qa,1575910315.0,Trying to quit smoking right now and it's crazy how similar they are
BPD,faal8qa,t1_fa8q64n,1575910279.0,"That wasn't a lot! I know how hard it is and I really struggle with going back to harmful relationships too, because I'm just in so much emotional pain."
BPD,faako7k,t1_faad58v,1575910076.0,"I actually talk about this *all the time*. ""Personality Disorder"" makes it sound like it's *who we are*. 

I can't even remember who said it, but I'm assuming it's because someone defined a ""personality"" as our repeated behaviors/actions.

But I think it should really be considered a trauma or developmental disorder. If only to reduce stigma."
BPD,faain34,t1_fa9eqyh,1575909309.0,Thank you for helping this be a safe space for discussion
BPD,faahwm9,t1_faa4z3q,1575909034.0,"How is it abuse exactly? Abuse isn't whenever someone says something you don't like or agree with, or that you simply find rude. It's not like the post is *attacking* or *insulting* anyone. It was intended to be something supportive and helpful, and I apologize if it came off any other way."
BPD,faacimj,t1_faa1tnd,1575906928.0,"I'm so glad you understand what I mean! Willingness to learn and try to address problems is the foundation of growth, and I'm always happy to meet someone with a curious/thoughtful attitude.

I think some people feel personally attacked by this post, but that reaction says a lot. They can't handle a post with someone suggesting their dependency is unhealthy. But even if someone doesn't agree, there's still reason to think and talk about it."
BPD,faab7mw,t1_fa9xbym,1575906408.0,"Never, ever get another FP. ;) But if you do, remember boundaries and Interpersonal Effectiveness skills"
BPD,faab1xb,t1_fa9x55n,1575906337.0,"Wow, that's so insensitive of them!"
BPD,faaawhz,t1_fa9vylc,1575906270.0,"That is such a wonderful story! I'm so proud of you for recognizing and working on problems. 

I have pretty eyes and full lips. I'm chubby but the hourglass kind. I can say these things because that's what I've been told, but I also have crippling self esteem issues and know what you mean by ""dating down"". So no judgment here."
