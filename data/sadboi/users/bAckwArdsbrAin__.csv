And even though I’ve been asked it about 200 times in the last year, I still haven’t perfected the answer. “Uh, well, I, um, we get to choose uh like two or three classes depending on if we do like science and humanities all year. I’m doing two which is, uuuuummm....art and medical forensics. But you only do the, for half of the year and then you switch to another two, which mine iiiiiisssss....I forgot, I think, like, um, uh, yeah idk. But then you have the mandatory classes like maths and English. Science and humanities are mandatory as well, but you have to do one the whole year and can choose to do the other for half or the whole. If you choose one of them half, then you get to choose 3 classes instead of, like, 2.”"
