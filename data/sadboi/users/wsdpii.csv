Most stories, even many historical events, tend to have a beginning, a climax, and an ending. And I honestly feel like ASOIAF doesn't have that. It's a story without a purpose.

Elves are tall, fair, ecologically friendly, and amazingly intelligent; Orcs are short, ugly, wasteful, and while crafty and clever, still amazingly stupid. Ents are wise beyond measure, strengthened by sunlight, and slow to action. Trolls are weakened by sunlight, very foolish, and quick to act. Maiar (like Gandalf) use their power only when necessary or when it benefits other people. Balrogs openly wield their strength in brazen displays of power.

WorldOfWarships,fog137p,t1_fofd1ta,1587746303.0,"I honestly prefer WTs premium system to this game. In WOWS: play a premium ship, which earns xp that you can't use, which you have to spend premium currency (IE, spend more moneys) to turn into currency that you can use. In WT: Premium vehicle comes with a boost to the amount of currency and xp you earn when using that vehicle, which automatically goes towards whatever vehicle you are researching at the moment."

DaystromInstitute,fob5x6f,t3_g6n99s,1587656446.0,"My favorite uniforms were the ENT uniforms. Sturdy material, lots of pockets, colored stripes to tell which division someone served in at a glance. It felt like I could imagine real starship crews wearing these (and they do, seeing as they bear a distinct resemblance to NASA uniforms). The ship design was also built with a concept of function over style, which makes sense as it's one of Starfleet's earliest vessels. It struck a balance between a more grounded and realistic appearance while still maintaining a lot of the positive messages and discussions that Trek is known for."

NewVegasMemes,fnsvuca,t1_fnsvpbj,1587229772.0,I meant it as more of the plot. The plot is fairly simple. Not a lot of twists and turns or surprise villains.
PrequelMemes,fnsvpkh,t1_fnshecv,1587229700.0,"Indoctrination is a hell of a thing. The context of the order in the old canon was pretty serious. Essentially, it said that the jedi have attempted to take control of the senate and have been branded as traitors. This is a big deal to the clones. They've spent their whole lives serving the Republic, and have spent the last three years dying in droves. Commander Bacara said this

""I hesitated for a moment when I received Order 66 because the last thing I expected was a Jedi coup. Did I feel betrayed? You bet I did. I thought of all my men who died under Ki-Adi-Mundi's command, and if I'd known then that he and his buddies were gearing up to do the Separatists' work for them and overthrow the government, I'd have shot him as a traitor a lot earlier. He betrayed the trust of every one of us."""
NewVegasMemes,fnsuega,t3_g3l68q,1587228986.0,The story isn't any better or worse than most others. It's fairly standard. What makes New Vegas special is the dialogue and characters. They turn a run of the mill video game story into something amazing.
