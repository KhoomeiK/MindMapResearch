I'm half asleep, so forgive my brusque advice:

- If you're worried that people who've gone through serious stuff won't take your problems seriously, talk to them about it and say so. 

- Truly boring people are very rare, and you can get good times out of almost anyone. If you want good conversations, you have to ask good questions - but not all of friendship is about conversation; great friendships can subsist entirely on what you do together.

- I wouldn't worry too much about trying to maintain a positive image of you that may or may not exist in someone else's mind. Good friends, of which I'm sure you have a few, will value you regardless. And you don't need to be friends with everyone.

- Keeping up with messaging and keeping in touch can be fiddly and difficult. Best not to stress too much about it. I can't know for sure, obviously, but I think it's highly likely that you cause yourself more bother by worrying about remembering stuff and checking in than you would by having a little faith in yourself.

Importantly, absolutely everyone is struggling to keep in touch reliably with people at the moment. The pandemic and its associated lockdowns have caused people to psychologically retreat into their shells."

The result of all this is that the morbidity rates you get to by using the official data are utterly inaccurate and useless.

There were a few incidents near the beginning of the pandemic in which the virus passed through isolated cruise ships. Comprehensively testing and examining people in these microcosms ultimately resulted in morbidity rates of ~0.1%."
