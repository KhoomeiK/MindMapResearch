But there's a lot more negatives. I've lost faith in ever having a successful marriage (because in my family there's been at least 10 divorces,) I used to be extremely non-committal and used to cheat a lot before I grew up, and I'm terrified to have kids if I did have a marriage because I wouldn't want to end up an absent father like my own biological dad. 

So basically the negatives outweigh the positives. I'm better to other people which is great of course, but I've basically accepted a life of dissatisfaction for myself. Meh."

LilPeep,foedruw,t3_g5bacs,1587701356.0,"Fun story. Listened to Peeps popular work in 2017, junior year, right before he died. Loved him but never went further than I did. My friend told me when he died and I was sad for him. 

A year later I was in class with a girl who was a heavy fan and we were talking, standing out in the hall about to go home. She started saying a lyric thinking I knew. I didn't. I was close, but didn't get it.

I felt AWFUL. And so school ended, and I decided I had to learn.

I learned his name, his story, all his girlfriends and the people he worked with and his dog Taz the legend and the fact he threw up when he was nervous and his unreleased songs and his rare pics.

To some people, I'm a fake fan because I learned about him AFTER his death.

To those people, I say fuck off because I put so much time and devotion into him. To this day I listen to him every day, when I'm happy sad whatever feeling. I listen to Awful Things. I listen to 2008. I listen to Deathwish. I listen to Lil Poop Freestyle for Christ sakes. I also cry over this man. His death hurts me. His life keeps me alive. My heart beats for this guy. 

We are all fans. If you love Gus, you love Gus and nothing will change that."
