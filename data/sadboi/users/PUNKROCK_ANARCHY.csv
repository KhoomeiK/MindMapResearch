The lumpenproletariat are the unemployed, and workers of socially ostrisised or illegal jobs. You may not like them, and Marx may not have liked them, but they are an important part of the revolution in the Global South.

Its not seeing the world through rich and poor countries, it's seeing the world as how it exists today rather than how it existed in the 1800s. There can only be revolution in the Global North when they can't  exploit the Global Souths labour and resources to subdue the proletariat through social fascism, this is irrefutable and abundantly clear.

Marx was wrong about revolution coming out of industrialised countries. If Marx had lived long enough to see the effects of imperialism he would have gone back on it.

The proletariat of imperialist and colonized nations have distinct characteristics. The colonized proletariat relies on colonial exploitation to exist, while the colonized peasantry doesn't. The peasantry and lumpenproletariat are the revolutionary classes of the Global South. The colonized proletariat has everything to loose while the colonized peasantry and lumpenproletariat have nothing.

No communist revolution has ever came out of the Global North. Say what ever you want about the outcomes of revolution in the Global South (I don't care if you want to be wrong), but that is where the worlds revolutionary potential lies in the modern world. 

Your historical meterialist analysis is stuck in the 1800s. You are denying reality. You are nothing more than an ideologe.

That being because race, apposed to ethnicity, is a pseudo-biological grouping of social groups around arbretrary features. Usually used and historically created to impose racial hierarchy.

GenZedong,fddiesi,t1_fd37gzw,1578313549.0,"Do yourself a favor and read decolonial and Marxist feminist theory. The greatest revolutionary leaders understood and acted against oppressive social dynamics outside of purely class.

While most forms of social contradictions stem from class contradiction, they cannot be solely addressed through this framework.

The ""western"" proletariat does not have the same character as the colonized proletariat. The oppression of women cannot be addressed without, in part, an acknowledgment and understanding of maternal labour, which can only be understood through femanist theory.

Scientific socialism must be treated as a science, not an ideology, as such there is room for iteration and advancement. Intersectional theory, if conceptualized through a dialectical meterialist framework, is important and necessary for communists to follow."
