canada,fodvj74,t1_focvue8,1587690925.0,"> I don't think that's what's happened at all, they've taken plenty of criticism. Are they supposed to ignore her death? What level of mourning, in your expert opinion, is somehow malicious? 

I mean, giving her a full day as the only named victim of this tragedy combined with their delayed response in notifying the families of the deceased is a little troubling.

> Also what part of when you said they were not looking to save lives is criticism exactly? That's a sweeping claim without evidence, when in fact, has contrary evidence given that again, an officer died trying to save lives of Canadians. 

You're right. they did try to save Canadian Lives.

But they failed.

Whether it was their training, their resources, or their general attitude towards rural Canadians, they failed.

And their failure highlights a massive problem in this nation where civilians cannot rely on Her to protect them.  When in the entire 12+ hour massacre the only major interactions between the shooter and the police are when he murders one of them and then is killed by others, that is a failure on the part of the police.

You can believe it isn't malice behind the piss poor police presence in rural Canada, but the reason why doesn't matter.

What does matter is that there is a piss poor police presence in rural Canada and the Canadian Government at all levels doesn't seem overly concerned about it except when they use the crime in these areas as justification to strip back what few liberties and protections we do have."
canada,fodudml,t1_fodbo1y,1587690296.0,"> So....don't have laws?

Fantastic strawman.

Law-abiding citizens follow laws.

Laws are there to tell law abiding citizens what is acceptable to do in a specific circumstance.

There are evil people who will commit evil within the law, so new laws will stop the legal exploitation of the system.

But if someone has shown themselves to be willing to break a law, then it cannot be assumed that adding a new law will prevent people like them from doing the same

TLDR - There is a middle ground"
canada,fodu0sy,t1_fod7v0n,1587690108.0,"> You can't have new legislation because this guy's guns were ""illegal""? So if they were obtained legally you'd be OK with new legislation?

Yes.

If he followed all the rules and still was able to commit this tragedy, then that would be proof that the rules are ineffective and should be changed.

If he broke the rules and was therefore able to commit this tragedy, then why do we think adding more rules will stop people like him?

The time and money spent focusing in this legislation would be better spent increasing the number of officers so that an officer like Const Heidi Stevenson doesn't need to get involved 1 on 1 with backup being minutes away. It would be better spent on mental health so that when someone like the shooter begins stepping towards the deep end there are resources and people able to step in and stop him before anything bad happens. It would be better spent doing virtually anything else that might have actually stopped a tragedy like this"

Is it purely that the access to authority and power over other people will lead to abuse of that power?

As much as the Stanford Prison Experiment showed us everyone is capable of evil, people like Bill Gates and the existence of genuine non-profit organizations and charities would indicate that people are also capable of good.

The idea that ""all cops are bastards"" should really be ""Most police publicized in the media are bastards"".

1 - A good cop may be publicized for a single bad act. One side does not wash out the other.

2 - You don't hear about cops who just do their job and go home.
