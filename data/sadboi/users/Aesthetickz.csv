KrunkerIO,foa4owb,t3_g6da4c,1587639437.0,"1.	Absolutely 100% agree, any mechanic being tied to FPS is simply a design flaw. There is no good excuse, you’re putting people with lower end computers at a disadvantage and having unpredictable broken mechanics in general. As a software developer myself I realize it’s probably not an easy fix and is probably in the core code of the game. Still I think this should be fixed with the highest priority.
2.	Choosing a strong password is YOUR responsibility in the first place, Krunker’s responsibility is to store it safely. The things the devs could really do is making the password requirements stricter, adding brute force protection and adding two factor authentication.
3.	The trash talk is annoying, but really hard to counter by the devs. It’s really the community that needs to grow up. In any online game there will be toxic people. Just being able to block people is a good thing to have.
4.	Saying the devs don’t care is a bold statement to make. How do you know that? They are pushing out quite some updates so they are hard at work. I do agree they should fix these core issues with priority."
