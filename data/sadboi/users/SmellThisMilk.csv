politics,fp6qkt3,t1_fp6gxla,1588356877.0,"I work in archives and I can tell you that it doesn't work like that. I really wish it did, though! 

The vast majority of material that Biden sent from his career is not digital. For the kind of search most people are imagining to take place, the documents would need to be digitized first. Each and every page needs to be either scanned or a high quality photo taken of it, because you're trying to make a high quality master that every digital derivative will be made from. If you have millions of pages of documents, that takes a really long time, even with a team of people doing it full time. 

Those digital files need to be stored on a server. I'm sure the University of Delaware already has something like that, but they would need to arrange for funding to allocate server space for that specific use. Even if the UoD were to expedite that, it would still take time just to make the digital transfer. You're not just uploading files over the internet, because that's prone to interrupts. You are arranging for one if not several external drives to be sent to the server physically.

Then, once the files have all been digitized and stored, if you want to do a key word search, you need to run all those documents through a text analysis program to make the text searchable. Again, if you have millions of files, that can take a really long time. That becomes especially complicated when you have a bunch of different kinds of documents. Maybe letters and speeches are simple, but forms are more complicated and the program might need different settings to handle those. Similarly, if the documents were written on mechanical type writers, there may be errors that require quality control by a human.

None of this takes into account the time needed to design the work flow for a team to actually process all of these documents, hiring the team, clearing legal constraints for different kinds of documents, etc.

You might say, well why not just focus on personnel files to cut down on the time it takes? Surely they are in a dedicated box or folder, separate from speeches or memos. Personnel files for Senate staffers are held by the Senate and the National Archives and would not be part of Biden's papers at the UoD, so you're searching for a complaint in a collection of documents that it isn't really supposed to be part of. Biden has called for people to look into those files.

You might also say, well surely they've already started doing all of this, these are really important documents. Every significant archive in the world has pallets and pallets of material waiting to be digitized, including the National Archives. Its part of a HUGE effort that archivists have been engaged in for the past 20 years, but archives don't receive a lot of funding, so its usually only a small team of people who are working through the backlog which is also filled with many other really important documents.

TL;DR Processing the senatorial papers for someone who served in Congress for as many decades as Biden did is a really big effort. Even if the University of Delaware made the files accessible right now, it would  take a really long time to search for 'Tara Reade' or any other complaint."

The first time I saw A Star is Born I thought it was about a country star having an affair with a trans pop star and their forbidden love.

""WTF are you talking about?"" you may be wondering. So, context... I was on a 9 hour plane ride and found that the audio in my seat didn't work. I hadn't brought anything else with me to do, so I was so bored that I just started looking around at other people's screens, not knowing what movie they were watching, unable to hear it. I started paying attention to a screen like three rows up when I saw the scene where Lady Gaga gets discovered while performing in a drag club. Seeing her taking off her makeup backstage with other drag performers, I thought ""Oh, she's trans, this is some indie movie about a trans singer and this country star getting together.""

I do not follow Lady Gaga, don't listen to her music, I barely know anything about her, much less what she looks like. Over and over again throughout the movie, I kept thinking, wow, good for this actress. She transitioned and was able to get this really visible career and star in this movie that helps normalize trans identity. I kept seeing scenes of her boyfriend freaking out and breaking down and I just thought, yeah, I mean, he can't really be open about this relationship because it would destroy his country music career if he was open about being with a trans woman. What a sad story.

Then the credits rolled and I remembered that Lady Gaga had starred in some movie a few years back. I didn't know what to think at that moment except that Lady Gaga makes a really hot trans woman... I guess."

The 111th Congress presided over America during a horrible economic down turn that revealed systemic faults in our economic (specifically financial) system. Despite this, they were able to achieve a number of progressive and liberal priorities, including:

Repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell, expanding health insurance to tens of millions, ending discrimination against people with pre-exisitng conditions, making it easier for women to sue their employer for equal pay, a massive overhaul of financial regulations and so much more.

If the Democrats don't take control of the federal government, progressive priorities will be ignored. That's reality."

politics,fnsp4f4,t1_fnsl2mr,1587226099.0,"That makes perfect sense, people are suffering immensely because of the economic impact of this shut down. In fact, MORE people are suffering because of the shut down than the disease itself. The deprivation millions of Americans are going through can not be downplayed right now. This wont be a blip, this is going to be worse than 2008.

If infections start spiking up (and they are in many places without shutdown orders), then our healthcare system will get overwhelmed. When the healthcare system get overwhelmed, the death rate will start to spike. 

**Here's the really important part, though. The death rate will spike for ALL causes of death, not just coronavirus. If the healthcare system is overwhelmed by coronavirus patients, it will not be able to deal with any other health problems.** 

If you get into a car accident, no doctor will treat you. If you get an infection from cutting yourself on something at work, no doctor will treat you. If you are giving birth, no doctor will treat you. If you have a chronic illness, no doctor will treat you. They will all be busy either treating coronavirus patients, or they themselves will be too sick to treat you. The alternative is to simply isolate covid-19 patients and tell them 'good luck.'

Our modern economy can not function without modern healthcare. You think things are bad now, they will get MUCH worse if no one can get healthcare. People will die in the streets and their bodies left there because [the morgues will be full](https://time.com/5812569/covid-19-new-york-morgues/). That high estimate of over 2 million people dying is only from covid-19. It doesn't include the people who will die from lack of proper healthcare."
politics,fnsmacg,t1_fnsetuz,1587224520.0,"Yeah, that's the specific conspiracy theory people are embracing, but it'll change to a different target and a different theory in a few years to match the circumstances. At base level, a lot of people feel powerless and like their interests just will never be represented. They feel 'forgotten' or 'left behind,' like Trump keeps saying. Until those people feel like they have a decent place in the modern world, they will continue to embrace bullshit conspiracy theories and demonizing people who try to do good."
politics,fns91qr,t1_fns06yg,1587216123.0,"They believe that the rich and powerful are inherently corrupt and are only trustworthy if they admit and openly embrace corruption and their own sense of greed. Bill Gates has transformed himself into an historic altruist and therefore must be hiding something worse than simple corruption and greed.

The world has grown so complex and interconnected that the only people who have any hope of even vaguely understanding it require levels of education, experience and/or resources that the vast majority of people have no hope of ever achieving. This means that being a morally upstanding person who can meaningfully engage in public discourse is not something we are all born with, but something that only the elite members of society can seriously be a part of. That leaves the average Joe not only a pawn in a rich man's game, but an impotent fool that is laughed at by the elite.

By buying into such a cynical world view, people who feel as though they have no power in their lives can internally hold onto a sense of dignity, because they at least KNOW they are being manipulated. This kind of thinking leads them to reject any genuine attempt at altruism by the powerful and embrace blatantly corrupt figures as truth-tellers and saviors. In a corrupt world, who do you trust to tell you the truth? The super rich guy who acts like a saint, or the super rich guy who is openly and blatantly corrupt? The latter, because both of them know the world is corrupt, but only the latter is honest about it.
