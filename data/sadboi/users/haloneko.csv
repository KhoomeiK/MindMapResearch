actuallesbians,fo9whsl,t3_g68fev,1587633356.0,"im not sure if this works for anyone else but I have a similar problem where I dress one way but I want to dress multiple ways and it feels like im an imposter. mine has mostly to do with anxiety rather than internalized homophobia because I've always dressed a certain way (jeans and hoodie type, kind of masculine) but im about equally interested in femme and stud styles. at first I was super super anxious about it, but the first step for me was to think about it a whole lot just to get myself used to the idea. 

my friends are used to my strange interests, so I could just reveal whatever weird thing caught my eye (an extreme example is my deep interest in lolita fashion) but if you're worried about your friends' reactions then id suggest maybe finding the right opportunity to make some off-handed comment on like a dress or something like ""oh that's cute"" and play it off nonchalantly to them just to make your interest known and keep doing that to get them used to it as well. since youre worried about being seen as ""not belonging"" in womens' clothes then a gradual change might be better.

as for physical expression, you could start by piercing your other ear or wearing more feminine earrings. if you have shorter hair, consider letting it grow long. try out some more feminine hairstyles. maybe wear some makeup or nail polish around the house to get used to it before the quarantine ends; you probably wont be as self conscious if you go out in it after you're used to having it on. if someone asks questions you could play it off as trying out a new style or tell the truth that you realized you're more into feminine styles than you thought. most likely, the person in question won't mind. while we're in quarantine you might want to start looking at the types of feminine clothing you'd like to try, as well as making a list of clothing types you don't think you'd be comfortable in no matter what. for me, its short dresses and shirts that expose my chest more than a little. there's no point in trying to dress feminine if you're uncomfortable with what you're wearing. also, feminine styles don't have to be super girly with heels and dresses. a typical femme look for me is something like high waisted jeans, a tucked in cute shirt, vans, earrings, styled hair, and a little make up. its somewhat masculine but I still consider it as a more feminine presentation.

dont convince yourself there's some sort of time limit. there isn't. take it at whatever pace you feel comfortable with. there is no wrong way to go about this. there's also no way to not belong in certain styles of clothes. are you wearing them? do they fit? do you feel comfortable in them? then good! you belong in them.

lastly, remember this: humans are not static creatures. we have no permanent state of self. anything can change at any given time and if that change is realizing you're more femme than you thought then that's okay! there's nothing wrong with you. if anyone actually makes a big fuss about it im not sure they're the best person to be around anyway.

I wasn't sure how much help you were looking for, so I tried to make it detailed. sorry if its way too much lol I just figured if I was in your position I would want something like this. but if you have more questions, I'll do my best to answer them."

I am glad our tenants are retirees so they still have their income, but even if they were some poor young adults or something we wouldn't kick them out. I am also worried about my own senior year, though, because I'm supposed to graduate in late May, but if this goes on graduation will have to be pushed into June and we are moving the week after graduation!!! And it's too late to change anything!!!!!! And they postponed prom as well! I know I probably sound entitled because I obviously know people are dying because of this virus, but right now these are the biggest events of my life, and the world cannot stop forever because of COVID-19.
