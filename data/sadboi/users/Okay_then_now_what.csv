Recently I randomly started taking a lower dose (because weird ideas that it was muting spirituality or taking some of my personality) and started sort of rapid cycling.

Not that it's your fault, and definitely not to downplay how fucking difficult managing Bipolar can be...But when already in a depressive episode (state, phase, whatever you want to call it) there comes a point when your cognitive patterns are keeping you down. Not to sound all hippy, but negative thoughts really do have an effect on you, and lead to these cycles. Because you mention getting overwhelmed I would advise being patient with yourself. Setting up realistic, little goals. Little things to get excited about! 

I totally understand what you mean about pursuing interests and inspiration. Stable or not, I often get discouraged because I don't know how long I'll stick to something. I also fear anything that might be fueled by mania due to its unreliability, and it keeps me from trying new things or taking risks (I am currently trying to get over this). However, I find comfort in the interests of mine that have stood the test of time (learning languages, room rearranging, painting,etc.) Do you have any interests like these that you can separate from mania? I also think that making sure you are involved in communities that share interests can be important. I made some tattoo artist friends recently, and forgot how good it feels to be with people who value art like I do. And try new interests too. Like watching a movie from a genre you never watch, or making yourself a devoted fan a local sports team. Just because these things might not last, doesn't mean that they are anything like manic decisions of the past

Also, as far as having the time to pursue anything you want? I've learned that can be a trap! Just because you HAVE the time to explore and try things, doesn't mean you have to come out of it with some great masterpiece or deep wisdom."

BipolarReddit,fhk4qax,t3_f3ocmz,1581666738.0,"I was in practically the same position as you. During school and even after graduating, I had the chillest, most low-stakes job. But knew I needed to find something else after I got back on my feet from a depression. I have now been at my first real post-college job for over 4 months now. I was SO nervous, internalizing the idea that I am not stable enough to keep down a job, plus a lot of imposter syndrome. 

The biggest things I would tell you (or me from a few months ago!):

1. Starting a new job IS a huge adjustment that can take a while. But so is medication trials, therapy, starting school, moving, any other big change. I'm sure you can handle it. Especially if you already have coping tools or medications that help you (for me, my art and journaling help keep me going)

2. People are generally patient and understanding. Because they get that these adjustments can take time. You can always ask coworkers how they felt when they started, or any tips they have. If you get a job where no one shows you patience or understanding, then maybe it's not a good place. But even then at least a place to start, and something to learn from.

3. Before you even land a job, any sort of worrying is practically useless. Because so much of it might not even be relevant to whatever position you'll find yourself in. Worries happen inevitably, but one useful thing for me was to journal these worries. Then later I could look back and realize oh, that wasn't a problem at all. And that encourages me.

4. There will be stressful parts of your job you don't love., even if it's a great fit. This was a huge lesson for me. When I got my current job, it was obvious to everyone that it was a perfect fit, like everything was meant to be. My job allows me to work on projects like curriculum (which I LOVE), but I also have to take phone calls sporadically. That really stresses me out. But it's just one small thing that is a necessary part of my job. And I keep telling myself that someday, I wont have that as my job description. 


I hope this is even a little helpful, it turned out rather long hehe. But I totally understand the worrying. For now just keep up the job hunting! Be patient, keep your head up, and give yourself credit for coming this far with all the bipolar hurdles â™¡"

schizophrenia,fhjshsf,t3_f37mq4,1581654323.0,"I tend to stutter a lot, but I think it is largely from my internal reality being so different from others. That make sit hard to put things into words. Between the voices I hear and my own voices I have a hard time controlling the voice I use to other people"

schizophrenia,fhjrozm,t1_fhhhu3x,1581653695.0,"Yeah, I come here to feel like I can get through this stuff. So we can validate each others experiences without pushing each other ove the edge. Not so I can rev up my own delusions :("
schizophrenia,fh394gr,t1_fh1vc37,1581266279.0,"Yes I've heard my mom's, and it sounds like its coming from a radio. Really really scary.
It's interesting when it's a voice like mother's, pdoc/therapist didnt know how much to attribute to trauma"
BipolarReddit,fgtbvyg,t1_fgt7ux8,1581102265.0,"You're welcome. Good luck with trauma. I know that stuff doesn't go away, but you build more and more tools. 
We got this."
BipolarReddit,fgtboyy,t1_fgrvt83,1581102181.0,"""Appreciate the little things"" 
I could not agree more. This mentality helps me so much. Sometimes driving home from work, I get to see all the Puget Sound crows (est. 16,000 crows) go to roost. That makes me remember how beautiful things are, no matter what my head feels like."
BipolarReddit,fgstit4,t1_fgsl9lm,1581092341.0,"Pretty quickly into it, like a few weeks. At the time I was in a relationship with a really great person, I just didnt understand why I acted certain ways so DBT helped with that. It was more of trauma/emotional things to address rather than bipolar per se."
BipolarReddit,fgrrboe,t3_f060st,1581054910.0,"Oh I feel ya. 
I occasionally find this peace, where I feel spiritually open and curious, yet grounded and stable.  
But without feeling the old extremes....its hard to notice feelings at all. I'm in DBT which is really helpful, and I love conceptualizing emotions. But I don't even recognize them in my current self."
schizophrenia,fgo7szb,t3_ezc3sx,1580961914.0,"Something I'm trying to do, is imaging myself in future situations behaving confident the way I want to. If I know I'm gonna meet with so and so tomorrow for work, I'll imagine multiple scenarios where things dont go my way or maybe they do, but regardless I am confident and sure of myself"
BipolarReddit,fgmo0b8,t3_ezaoze,1580928504.0,"I'm a compulsive analyzer. So I tend to think of things as neurocognitive rather than emotional. Things are due to sleep, nutrition, meds, bipolar tendencies, etc.

I believe in love and emotional and spiritual connections with people....but oxytocin is honestly just another chemical that when thrown in the mix can really fuck shit up. As a hormone, it also stays in effect longer than neurotransmitters that are largely at play in bipolar disorder. 

So yes, if you already have an unstable or delicate brain chemistry, a powerful hormone like oxytocin can most definitely mess with you, and take you on a wild ride. I just like to conceptualize it as such when I feel so strongly emotional in a relationship."
BipolarReddit,fgk7xtz,t3_eyyltg,1580859423.0,"It has been great for me! I think it was the first med I tried that actually worked. Now I take it alongside Seroquel and Lamotrigine.

I had some side effects with Welbutrin, but it was worth the wait of a few weeks to get used to them. Even now if I dose up, i get the side effects for 1+ week and then I'm good."

BipolarReddit,fe6odky,t1_fe6bql8,1578898048.0,"That's very well put, and I agree. Alternatively, sometimes my therapist could communicate important things to my pdoc that I didnt always feel comftiavke sharing directly with her. Best when there's a whole team on your side!"
