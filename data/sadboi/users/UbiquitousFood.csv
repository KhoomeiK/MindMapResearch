ptsd,f6alnru,t3_dqq69n,1572758710.0,"Yep I was diagnosed bipolar because antidepressants gave me insomnia and they assumed it was hypomania. Other doctors thought it was bipolar because i have chronic depression and anxiety that kind of cycles, but hypomania just doesn't fit. Finally I've seen a psychologist that thinks it's PTSD, which I've always suspected."
BasicIncome,f4py1ek,t3_dl72ra,1571744828.0,I feel you. Sometimes I think I'd be better off if I was born further in the future.
Effexor,f4pgx7s,t1_f4jlpiu,1571729991.0,Drugs can have different effects on different people. Effexor is actually the only med that's ever helped my anxiety  out of the many that I've tried. It reduced my rumination and number of panic attacks and i don't know what I'd do without it.

prozac,erofgio,t3_c31ad4,1561077576.0,"The reason you aren't supposed to drink alcohol on antidepressants is because it can increase the effects of it. I just use caution and monitor my dizziness/drowsiness, pace my drinking, and drink plenty of water in between drinks."
