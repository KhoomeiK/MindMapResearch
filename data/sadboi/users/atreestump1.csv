Jeremy Renner's character is a broken disheveled man who's own daughter was killed a year or so before the movie starts. So they work together to figure it out ..

In the prequel movie, there's a hard cut after Anakin kills Dooku during the conversation between Anakin and Obi Wan (I can't remember the name of the planet they are on.)

Also, this might just be a personal preference but I would've kept the parts where Anakin predicts his mother's death, then goes and kills the women and children and then cut to the scene with Obi Wan's message to Yoda and Windu from Kamino. Not enough time passes between Obi Wan and Anakin splitting up and Obi Wan on Kamino. I feel adding that Anakin's Mom subplot could work well for that, and giving his eventual turn to the dark side a bit more credence IMO"

I'd been to that house a thousand times before, but when I showed up this time, it was like the atmosphere was different and wonderful. Like Christmas morning as a kid, something was there and I couldn't wait to find it. So I went in and walked straight to the computer room where she was. 

We talked for the entire year that I was in Korea and when I came back we got engaged. I went to NC, she went into Navy Basic, and the distance, the separation just hurt me too much.
