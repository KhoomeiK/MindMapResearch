Thank you for sharing"
fantasywriters,fpujanp,t3_gfgd80,1588914377.0,"In my story I have a group that worship a prisoned lightning deity.  They bring someone to a specific place and sat at an alter.  It’s normally a wanted person in the world that done bad.  Then the leader calls upon the lightning deity to shoot lightning at the wanted man from the sky.  

It’s pretty much a form of sacrifice that this group does to please the lightning deity in hope that one day he’ll be released from his prison and they’ll be given favour and powers from him."

I couldn’t eat out in public, at times I’d eat half a meal and feel like I wanted to throw up from the nervousness.  I could only eat alone and even then I started to feel sick.  
But I moved to another country with friends for a year and forced myself to eat in public and I got immensely better with my anxiety.  I faced that fear head on in a whole different environment and conquered it!

I hope you do too :)"

When I get in those depressed days I use the moderate mode as the suicidal thinking and the severe mode being very close to losing my mind.  When I’m depressed as well I’m there are periods where I’m very angry.  But only internally I don’t want the people around me be a victim.  I don’t want them to see me like that as well."

But I guess if I want the help that just what I’m gonna have to do right? Haha O.O"

I just looked up what BPD is today in great detail but it didn’t really fit with me.  But then I came across something called “Quiet BPD” and that felt like it hit the nail on the head unfortunately.

Also these past 3 weeks I’ve ranged from wanting to kill myself to studying engineering (an online course thing to understand all the types of engineering there is what how it all works) And I almost signed up for university for next year to do environmental or civil engineering :s I was very full into it and a week went by then BAM I got him by a wall that I pretty much felt my brain flip in a sudden.  Depressed and unmotivated, this led me to refuse engineering.  So much effort in getting up, making coffee and even having a shower.  This went on for 3 days. 

I started picking up speed again and decided to look into trade jobs, and bricklaying stood out to me (we are also in demand here in Australia and there’s opportunities overseas and in construction) I watched videos on how to brick lay and I also applied for an apprenticeship, I love hard working jobs as well.  Also during this time I spent 3 days figuring out an algorithm to win the lottery or to atleast increase my chances in profiting in the divisions.  Successfully I made I won $365 on my last ticket of $6 :D prolly gonna do some more.  

But anyways I still am in this mixed state I feel.  At the moment I’ve been thinking a lot about my past and my disappointments.  Which has led me down a dark path.  I couldn’t sleep last night because my mind was only focused on my memories, I slept 3 hours.  

Is it possible to have both disorders?  Is it common?

I’m gonna be honest I’ve been told I’m a really smart person but lately I just get the feeling that I’m not sure if I have normal mind, I don’t know how to react to people telling me bad news.  I don’t know what the normal reaction is to people.  It’s hard for me to understand what the normal is. 

Thanks!"
