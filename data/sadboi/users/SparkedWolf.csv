It still begs the question as to why things are as they are, but maybe in a short life like this one resistance to present structure is the more relevant problem, rather than the present structure itself. At the end of the day, everyone wants to feel okay, and feeling okay comes when one's situation is also okay. Seeing a bad situation in a positive way might be one way to start changing the situation itself, since life is in the mind anyways. Don't become deluded, of course. Actually, get even more realistic. Things will be okay, you'll be okay. Enjoy the little things."

You have to allow your experiences to reinforce the initially flimsy belief that everything is your own fault, you have to give yourself time.

Maybe there are more things inside a house that the character actually uses than one would initially suspect. Maybe the world the character inhabits is more hostile or more friendly to the character than one would expect.

I like David Foster Wallace's short stories, and their structures are usually not all that different from IJ itself, but the problem I found in the book is that DFW is always trying to outdo himself in some way. The book became obnoxious to me not because he was trying to be smarter than the reader or to make the reader feel incapable of finishing the book, but because he was at all times somehow trying to be smarter than himself, as if he had a ghost inside with a mind like his, who was chronically competing with him. Nearly halfway through the book the lines between what the author was trying to establish, whether it was realism or comedy or satire or something new altogether, became blurred. His intention betrayed itself, and I found neither realism nor comedy nor satire nor novelty in what I read, so I stopped, a bit disappointed and a bit disgusted. I still read DFW because he is a great author, and someday I think I'll pick Infinite Jest up again to finish it, but he was an author with his flaws, and these are granted a much broader light in a book of this scope. With this in mind, I'd say read it, give it a try, because there's so much value inside that the book's indispensable, but be wary that nothing within is perfect. It will be up to your subjective interpretation whether you feel entertained or not."
spirituality,f9jya5p,t3_e51ppi,1575388639.0,"You don't have to suffer to get enlightenment. In fact, enlightenment is the complete release from pain and suffering, it's anti-suffering. The path to enlightenment requires the realization that everything but your pain and suffering is real. All that plagues you has been created in your mind, and this is because you were born into a life defined by decay, afraid and feeling alone until you gazed into the eyes of the first person that held you and presumably knew love. So fear is naturally predominant to love in this life. One must realize this in order to learn that you can choose love to be predominant, but fear has just as many tricks as love has gifts, and it all comes from your mind. So, act in the knowledge that you are responsible for your own pain and suffering, that nobody directly caused it but you, and that this can all subconsciously change with time if you shoulder the burden of existential responsibility. It's what they teach you in religions with metaphors and parables, but the science to it is basically responsibility for your subconscious evils. Love is the only truth that can bring life but fear has more power in a life ultimately ending in death, so the acceptance of death nullifies fear's reign over you. Have faith, because you're setting down the bricks to Heaven yourself with each step you take."

On the other hand, acknowledging the divine aspect of yourself is a good reminder of where all things are going. And that's what an ego is for, by the way. Separation. I hate that common thing in spirituality that implies that egos are inherently bad. Before you were born you had no ego. But you were born with one for a reason, and it's to have unique experiences in this physical life. Trying to kill your own ego just eliminates your individuality, but not your ego.

I'm not saying people don't have divinity, I'm just pointing out that their minds and bodies are physically fragile and need to develop in order to become more divine, one can't just manifest it into being without work, and even then there's only so much a human can do.

The thing about getting your prayers answered is that when you pray, you're really praying to yourself, because you are the universe, one of its many egos. You don't have any real power over the physical universe outside of you though, so usually nothing significant will happen. The power you do have, however, is just as good because it doesn't break the laws of physics and therefore still keeps life interesting. You have the power to hold yourself accountable for everything you know. Little do most of us know that our minds are the cause of all our problems. Because of our own egos, we will often rely solely on our existing knowledge to try to change our lives for the better. However, this gets us basically the same bad results we've always gotten, because it reinforces the same behavior. What all this means is that your problems are, subconsciously, your fault. Keep this in mind, hold it as a real belief, and over time your subconscious will realize it is true and begin fixing these seemingly impossible issues. Along with holding yourself accountable, this belief will come with an acceptance of the universe as it is, because it really can't be any different. Only *you* can change, which in turn changes everything around you. Finally, just remember that the universe loves you and your free will is the only thing that causes you any real harm.

writing,f91g6e0,t3_e34a9s,1574989008.0,"Okay, this may sound weird, but the foundation of flirting is based on logic. You don't need to actually be good at flirting to attract someone if that person sees you on a deeper level and likes what they see. These flukes happen, as we know. But other than that, flirting occurs to indicate confidence in sexual ability. It has to do with lust more than love. It's a verbal and physical game, with the end goal being to see who can get what they want without giving the other person what they want. This can later determine dominance in the bedroom. Flirting is fun if what you want is purely sexual. Otherwise, dialogue will be completely normal and natural (chemistry/love), because the end goal is marriage and family. In order to make your characters flirt realistically and effectively, have them make verbal and/or physical hints at what they want without them making it seem that they want this thing. Like, if said character is a guy and his end goal is to kiss this girl (maybe because he doesn't know what he wants next), he could say ""Your cheeks are red, are you embarrassed?"" (this is just a question intended to emotionally guage her) Followed by a response from the girl, meanwhile guy doesn't break eye contact, leans in, and withheld eye-contact from her means ""yes"" while a break means ""no"". I guess to flirt you have to risk rejection. In this scenario the goal was simple, and required minimal emotional investment because it's just a kiss (and he didn't have to explicitly say he wanted to kiss her, the whole time he merely hinted at it, which makes the actual action of kissing her feel pleasurable and spontaneous for both parties). The more emotional investment in a goal, the more flirting it takes to get there. Flirtation occurs subconsciously but everyone knows what it looks like and it's basically strategic war. I hope this makes sense. Human beings are very complex and strange."

Every animal is smart. Intelligence is an illusory concept, just another paradigm through which to see life. But when you hear that everything is equal, that means everything is equal in every way. Difference is merely a consequence of spiritual free will, but in oblivion all things are the same. The point of life is to have unique experiences."

My point is that all thoughts are essentially useless fodder to keep the conscious mind active, and they hold no real power. Power comes from your behaviors. So my advice is to ignore the chatter in your brain and do the things that lead you to feel satisfied, things which you don't need to sit down and have an internal discussion about because the desire for them is inherent in your being. Do what makes you happy, without questions my friend. It's like treading a path your soul put down for you."
spirituality,f8x5f2p,t3_e2lbj5,1574908713.0,"The universe is infinite in all directions, including inside and outside of you, and is also self-similar, like a fractal. So the problems you're currently perceiving as something outside of yourself actually find their source within you. Yes, the universe works against us all. God is very evil and so are we. But all power is within, and all of your problems boil down to subconsciously being your fault. Why this is only time will really tell, but I suspect everyone agreed to live a life in the physical universe in order to learn something important about good and evil, power and love, and what makes an experience satisfying. So, to solve these problems, just be patient and act in the belief that every problem comes back to your mind, and it is your mind's responsibility to fix it, therefore your responsibility to fix it. It's not so much ""do nothing"" as it is ""stop doing everything."" Only patience and a sense of responsibility can begin to heal the universe. That's how love thrives."

spirituality,f8upoi4,t1_f8uowj9,1574838288.0,"I'm dealing with the same problem at the moment. I just don't identify with my thoughts since I know that's not what I want to spend time doing. My subconscious is still adapting to that will. Basically, all of your desires are inherent in your being, and on a deep level you're diverting yourself from achieving them until you feel worthy of such a thing. It's abstract and subjective, and you can totally start getting what you want if you hold yourself responsible for it. But these things can take time because some things are hard to believe without conclusive evidence. Let your brain be held responsible for not thinking at all (or just less), and over time you will show yourself more and more conclusive evidence because ultimately it is not wrong to have desires. I hope I make sense to you. I'm overthinking a bit less every day but still young and learning so all I can do is my best. Good luck :)"
TheWeeknd,f8ulx7o,t3_e2az5j,1574833976.0,"I fucks with it heavy. I think The Weeknd's just singing/rapping about the vibe of his current experiences, and couldn't go back to sounding like he did on Trilogy without feeling like a hack. The Trilogy vibe will come back, I bet even he misses it, but his own mindset has to come full circle and he has to live out his present situation in order for that to happen. The man's rich and happy, let him sing about it. The energy on this song is definitely more intense than anything I've ever heard from him though. Makes me wanna snort something..."
spirituality,f8uku8h,t1_f8uk7k9,1574832842.0,"Both. Like I said, you were probably a god (spiritually omnipotent) before your physical birth. Everybody was, to some degree, and we all agreed that there is something to be learned from feeling completely powerless. I believe the journey's purpose is to permanently separate good from evil, so that peace and satisfaction may last for everyone of all natures. The point of living a human life is right in front of you; you're doing it right now. It's just as beautiful as it is tragic, and unfortunately it is short. So don't give any more energy to something originating from fear, it's not necessary anymore. Wait for your mind to rebalance its chemicals and give you happiness. There are things that cannot be psychically controlled (obviously), so happiness is a gift only your subconscious can give you. Do something right now that makes you even a little happier. Eat something. Press your head against the cool side of the pillow. Masturbate. Call someone up just to ask them how they are doing. Much love, my dude."
spirituality,f8ujecw,t3_e29y2t,1574831391.0,"You're not God, God is an ego separate from yours. Get away from that. And you're not alone. The point of creating separate egos is to love and be loved. Asking whether you're alone is pointless and a problem God is currently trying to solve. Right now, he's trying to solve it by making you ask yourself such terrible questions, which makes Him kind of a dick. I've been in your exact shoes with those questions and it's just a fear-vaccuum. There's nothing you can tell yourself to feel better so just listen to this: you haven't found enlightenment yet. All of your problems are secretly your fault because they are mind-fabricated. So just point the finger at yourself and WAIT. Be patient. Your subconscious will fix your mood if you put all the responsibility on yourself (therefore putting it on your subconscious). Again, just be patient. God has always existed as one ego, but he is not every single other ego at the same time, nor are they all Him at all times. You were probably once a god yourself, and you chose to live out this life of pain and suffering to learn something. So just lean back and learn. Pain and suffering, unfortunately,  is and will always be a choice, but never one you consciously make. That's why you gotta point the finger at yourself and say it's your fault, because your subconscious is evil. Okay, good luck and try not to kill yourself because you are loved and also feared and someday it will all make sense and it will be good forevermore. Much love from me :)"
spirituality,f8u2w3y,t3_e229py,1574817777.0,"Well, spirituality basically studies existence, while science basically studies things. Just explain yourself in terms of things. Like, oh, we're all God but no one realizes it? Makes sense from a spiritual point of view. No scientific basis though. How about you think of every consciousness as a number infinite in its own divisions, and separate people are different numbers. I am one and you are two. There are infinite numbers, but there are also infinite numbers within numbers (1,1.1,1.30454, so on). Therefore, if infinity works this way, then it's really all the same thing represented by different symbols. This is God. Scientists do math all the time. Maybe it'll blow their minds, maybe not. Anyways, I hope I'm making sense lol"

writing,f8t7v9v,t1_f8r4xgf,1574797699.0,"Well, for every action there are reasons. Like people, your characters are not a collection of actions. If you can imply a thought-process or emotion connected to every action, then this character will begin to feel more alive. What you *don't* say is equally as important as what you *do* say. It's a question of balance. Light and dark. What is seen and not seen. 50/50. The shadows on someone's face give it depth. The shadows on someone's actions do the same. Hope I helped and/or made sense. Good luck."
