Then I look over it and try to figure out ‚ÄúWhat am I specifically upset about?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat is the root/what is truly causing the issue?‚Äù Then I determine whether it‚Äôs worth confronting someone about and if so, how to do it appropriately (language, sticking to the facts, and simple sentences). 

I HATE confrontation, but have found if done appropriately, it often resolved the issue because I opened that line of communication and (sometimes) prevents things from building in the future. If nothing else, even if the person doesn‚Äôt agree (or even throws a fit), it‚Äôs not weighing on me anymore and I know I did all that *I* can do and I did *my* part in the right way."

I was close to broke at the time and needed affordable payments; didn‚Äôt have cash available. I chose to get a newer car because at the time it was still under warranty (until 2018) and knowing close to nothing about cars and being single at the time, I needed a car that was as reliable as possible.
