I have a ton of siblings so we all shopped used most of the time (parents included) but we never looked anything like this. We would go to ""city wide"" yard sale events and stay out for almost an entire day, going to every yard sale we could find. At many we'd quickly browse and then leave because the items were just not very nice and you could tell quite quickly that it wasn't even worth digging through their piles...but others you walk into the sale and can quickly tell their stuff is nice so then we looked a lot closer. Over the course of the day you'd find at least a handful that had really nice items. Thrift stores are sort of the same way, you can find really nice stuff sometimes but you have to be willing to invest time in digging through what is there to find the 'gems'. Where these kids it looks like someone just ran into the children's section at Goodwill and grabbed two handfuls of things and threw them on them at random.

In middle and high school I was ""brand conscious"" like most kids and fit in with other kids without an issue despite never buying anything from those brands at the mall. Nobody had a clue that my Abercrombie clothing came from yard sales for $2 apiece or whatever because we shopped used but only got items that fit well and were still in nice condition."

But with this show? I had such a hard time not preaching to her the whole time. I did make a few comments about some of the worst things I noticed, I just couldn't help myself - and thankfully she totally agreed with me and seemed to already take the same opinion as me without me even needing to point it out. Like how the kids seemed to be listening through the tapes in an attempt to figure out whose 'fault' the suicide was and how wrong it is to see suicide as something to blame on any individual. So that made me hopeful that some other teens were able to see through the worst parts of it too.

AFter taking it off and looking at the imprints on my skin, I see that the imprints from the gore are definitely pulled towards my bigger breast instead of bein centered which didnt' surprise me, but then the underwire on my bigger breast was well-placed in my IMF, but the underwire marks on the smaller side was up on my breast tissue a little.

This is my first time trying a bra that isn't lined or molded foam so it's a rather new style to me. My analysis of the cups was based on not quadding out the top and not having obvious air pockets on the sides/armpits like other bras I have tried..I guess I did more feeling than actually looking, haha. I've placed an order for a 28DD in this style to see how that goes. I did mean that I get some gapping and some quadding with this but only in weird positions. When I saw quadding in this bra earlier today I had squatted down and was leaning over and my bigger boob may have just been sort of falling out the top more so than quadding though. 

I believe I am somewhat center full, definitely not outer full so I'll probably take the ava off my to-try list. I will plan to still try the Marcie eventually. I don't wear very low-cut tops, i probably should have said fitted t shirts or something like that. I meant it more as an example of how I am not open to bras that have a lot of lacing or other textures that would look bad under thinner fitted tops. 

Thanks!"
ABraThatFits,fphcnx0,t3_gdf9d3,1588618911.0,"Seeing your comments about how you are still thinking a 28 must be too small...it really isn't. Look at your measurements. Your loose measurement size is 29 inches around. It's not possible for a 32 inch band to be too tight when your body is 29 inches because it has 3 inches of fabric than what your body needs to wrap around it. 

If your cup size is too small it can put pressure on your band because your breast tissue is being smushed and so that pressure has to go somewhere, it often ends up being felt in the band but that doesn't mean the band itself is too tight. 

My underbust measurements are loose 29, snug 28, tight 26.5 - almost identical to yours, and I fit a 28 band. I went from a 34B to a 28E and the 34B bras would gap at the top so I thought they were too big but when I tried 34A bras I would spill out the top so I thought I was just 'between cup sizes' when in reality it was a shape mis-match. I was buying 't shirt bras' in 34b which are made for rather shallow shapes and I am fairly projected, among other things."

Make it a regular conversation that you keep revisiting and he'll understand more each time. That's how children learn about a lot of things. For example, if you were going to try to discuss him using the toilet you wouldn't shy away from talking to him about potty training just because he may not grasp it all in the first discussion, right?  

My little sister was adopted and the main way I remember it coming up was when we would be around pregnant women, my mom used that as a good chance to bring it up and explain it again. We have a large family so newborns and pregnant women were around fairly regularly which is why that worked, i guess. For example if our cousin was pregnant and we went to the baby shower or something we'd tell her ""(cousin) has a baby in her belly! She's the baby's mom."" And then my mom would often launch into talking to my sister about it from there like...""Before you were born you were in (bio-mom's) belly and she's one of your moms. And then later you came to live with us and I'm your mom too! Some people have two moms. Some people stay with their mom who grew them in their belly, and some people live with a different mom.' or things like that. Our mom also laminate photo prints of her bio mom and of her with her bio mom the day she was born, etc so that she could drag them around without ruining them and we'd use the photos to discuss her story a little bit as well."

Coronavirus,fodt7iv,t3_g6n0i9,1587689676.0,"My partner and I live with my dad who is dying of prostate cancer and has COPD. Today the place my partner works announced that there are 2 workers who have been diagnosed with COVID. Those two aren't coming in to work anymore, of course, but who knows if it has spread to other workers already. So we aren't comfortable with him still going into work at this point. The company is not allowing people to excuse absences due to fear of COVID. So if he just calls in he'll lose his job. While it doesn't sound like it from the rest of this post, this has been a pretty good job for him, he worked up from being hired in as a factory line worker and he now does IT/programming type work which he doesn't have a degree for but has taught himself..so it's been a big step up for him and we'd hate for him to lose the job longterm as he'd have to start out on the floor of some other factory and try to work his way up again. He's going to try to get them to let him work from home because most of what he does is computer based and independently done so it could easily be done online at home...but they're really slammed with an increase in orders and are struggling to keep people coming in as it is...so they've had him coming in person just in case they need him to fill in on the line. Most days he does his computer work most of the day but he stops to fill on the line while the line workers take their breaks. He's worried they may value him filling in on the line too much to let him work from home...especially if more people stop coming in now that it's known that some workers had COVID. Is there anything we can do if they don't let him work from home to try to preserve his job opening even if not his pay?"
DuggarsSnark,fo9kshi,t3_g6dkrv,1587622427.0,"I'm somewhat conflicted. I was sexually abused as a little kid by an older family member (though they were legally a child also...they were like 8 or 9 years older than me) and I never told my family, i told my psychiatrist once I was a young teenager though and they told my mom. and then my mom told my aunts and grown cousins and some other people. and whenever people would say anything that helped me to realize my mom had told them...I was so embarrassed. So I totally understand that...and of course it being made public when you're a known public figure has to make it so much worse. I can't even imagine. The girls obviously don't deserve that and i'm sure that was an additional trauma for them and that's definitely screwed up.

At the same time...intentionally choosing to cover up or hide abuse from the public seems really wrong too. I think that could also be re-traumatizing or just really unhealthy for a victim if they feel like those close to them are of the belief that it needs to be swept under the rug. That could easily reinforce any struggles the victims have with it being a shameful thing. I definitely struggled with how what happened to me was shared without my consent...but if my mom had found out and then never told the rest of our family? That would feel like she didn't believe me, or didn't care that much or something like that. Maybe especially because the abuser was also a family member? But I feel like it was the right thing to do to let the rest of our family know that we had a piece of garbage in the family. 

And while maybe the duggars could have tried to not totally hide it but keep it secret within the family...I don't know something like that can truly be kept quiet when you have that many family member there would just be too much whispering and 'don't tell anyone but...' type things where it would end up completely being revealed I think. 

So to me it just feels like there are two terribly painful options, no way to truly protect the girls from further pain. :("

These people seemed to really flip to ""our governor is a nazi' when our shut-down order was revised to say that stores larger than 50k square feet (like Walmart stores) have to close down their lawn/garden centers, paint aisles and that using a boat with a motor was not allowed (can still kayak or use a row boat, etc). It snowed 3 days last week and hailed one other day here...so it's not boating or gardening season anyway. But people are primarily freaking out about the gardening part...this ""i have a right to grow my own food!"" mentality. Except...it's not that gardening was banned. Or that buying seeds or supply was banned. You just can't buy them in-store from BIG stores. You can still buy them from smaller stores, or even order them from big stores like Walmart online or from a curb side order. But people still think that is having their rights taken away. I'm not exaggerating with the nazi word. I've seen all sorts of people calling her one because of this. Our stay-home restrictions are more strict/detailaed than other states but the virus is really bad here too I think weird the third worst state or something.

And when talking in curl related forums I do identify as wavy. But in the rest of the world like out and about with 'ordinary' people? Everyone calls my hair curly because to most people who aren't hair-obsessed, ""wavy"" hair isn't really a term that is ever used. It's just straight or curly with nothing in between in most peoples eyes. If your hair has ""curve"" to it most people will call it curly regardless of how tight or loose those curls are. I think you could make the argument that even 2A waves are just really loose curls anyway.  So when talking to 'ordinary' people I do say my hair is curly but I'm not trying to pretend that my hair is primarily in the 3-range. I'm not desperate to tighten my waves either. I'm totally happy with my wavy hair because at least it's not a frizzy puffy mess like it was before I found the curly girl method. I grew up thinking you had to brush your hair as soon as you got out of the shower so I thought my hair was ""straight"" but frizzy/poofy when, in reality, I was just brushing my waves/curls out into a big mess.

Michigan,fmu7fam,t1_fmu3mmb,1586385970.0,"I think 'deserving' would get tricky fast. I worked from home before all this crap started and I moved in with my dad last summer because he's got a terminal form of cancer and also has COPD. So my dad and I are totally locked down other than his home nurse coming as needed and so on. We don't have grocery delivery as an option in my area but my partner or I are only going once every couple of weeks, etc. So me leaving the house is quite limited and my dad isn't leaving at all unless he were to have a doctor's appointment come up where he really had to go in. 

My long term boyfriend works a computer job for a factory that was deemed essential. So he certainly isn't as high risk as a medical worker or a grocery store cashier..he is in close contact with far fewer people than a cashier or whoever. And they've been flooded with orders so he's had a ton of overtime and we're grateful that we are actually doing well financially when so many are really financially stressed. But it sure feels like a big risk that we're taking that he goes out into the world every day and risks bringing a virus home to my dad who would almost certainly die if he gets it. It obviously sucks that my dad is dying either way, but letting him die all alone in a hospital is just unimaginable to me. I hate knowing that if he does somehow get COVID that we would basically know it came home from my partner's job. We'd have to live with that guilt. So the risk that my boyfriend is taking feels pretty heavy to us even though it's obviously a lot more minor than the risk to ""frontline"" workers. & I'm sure we aren't at all lone in being a non-medical or non-grocery store worker who feels the weight of exposing someone medically vulnerable in their household.  Also it just seems like the reality is that some of these people will bring this virus home to others and it will cause death in their family...isn't that 'deserving' of compensation even if their essential work wasn't frontline type work?

Aleeah is obviously just Leah with an A on the front, but it also bugs me because Aliannah sometimes sounds like it has 'leah' in it too depending on accent or on what syllables people emphasize most. Also it's just confusing because they call Aliannah Ali most of the time and Ali/allie could  be  logical nickname for Alleah as well. So poor Alleah can be confused as having her mom's name or her sister's nickname, basically. I assume that's why they started calling her by her middle name which is Grace...just becasue their names were all too similar to keep straight."

When looking at marks after taking the bra off, I can tell the underwire does go back too far into my armpits. Stupid question - but if I have a lot of bras that go too far into my armpits does that mean I have narrow roots (or at least that I don't have wide roots)? Or is that something different from what roots are about? Still trying to learn all the terms relevant to chest shapes for bra shopping.

I've never been overweight but I don't eat well. I grew up eating hot dogs and ramen noodles and sugary cereals and kool-aid made with more sugar than the instructions call for. I still eat too much sugar and carbs, not enough fruit or veggies. I have tried to explore eating healthier at times but it's challenging to go from what I think of as normal food to eating something like zucchini noodles or creamy spinach salmon. That's true for most americans, ""healthy weight"" or not...most of us don't eat as healthy as we should. It seems to me that obesity is more often just eating really excessive amounts of the unhealthy stuff. The kids I know both have one obese parent and one more healthy weight or perhaps 'just' overweight parent. Everyone in the houses eats somewhat badly...but some over-eat while others eat smaller portions of the bad foods. I live in a lower-income area which is a factor I imagine, but I barely know anyone who eats really healthy."

My600lbLife,fkr7asb,t1_fkr39nx,1584463236.0,"I don't think we have a clue how to really help obese kids as a society yet. There are people who send their kids to fat camp and make them drink only protein shakes for breakfast and make them skip pizza at birthday parties...and then are surprised when their kid starts sneaking food at night and has absolutely no self-worth and becomes MORe food-obsessed as a result of being unreasonably restricted. 

And then there are people who have 9 year olds who weigh 130lbs and they say things like ""well his uncle is 6'2"" so he's just going to be a big boy."" and who act like it's society that has a skewed idea of what 'healthy' is or that clothing companies who don't make jeans in a 34 waist but with a 4' tall kids inseam are the messed up ones. 

In my opinion, the only way to get kids to eat better is to normalize healthy eating and to not make them feel like they're a freak who has to eat protein shakes while their family eats pizza. But kids who are obese pretty much always come from obese, unhealthy families who aren't able to make the changes themselves. 

Even if a teacher or coach or doctor or extended family sees the problem..how can they get involved enough to help? The change has to come from who they live with because they have to change what is available in the cupboards and fridge at home. I have a 13 year old niece who is probably 160lbs and a 9 year old nephew who is probably 130lbs. I feel bad for them but I don't feel like I can do anything to help them."

I think you may have miswritten your measurements as you have your tight underbust listed as bigger than your loose underbust? I'm guessing the 28.5 is your lose underbust not your tight, as written.

I've been on the pill about four years now and the last few months I've been spotting a week before my period/withdrawl week for some reason and i've felt more 'hormonal' during that time in general..bloated, cramps, emotional swings, getting cold but sweaty easily (weird but that seems to be a PMS symptom for me lol).

I think I'll always be paranoid if anything ""off"" from the normal symptoms happens to me. But it's way better now vs when I first started on birth control.

TLCsisterwives,fj3wqhj,t1_fj3o84d,1582994964.0,"A lot of people assume they have a dead bedroom but from reading their book I really did not get that impression. I liked the book because of the insight it had for Janelle. IT's been 5 years or so since I read the book so this is all with a grain of salt but from what I remember...the book made me feel like Janelle is just the type of person who expresses herself best through writing vs social situations so I felt like I understood her a lot better after reading the book. The book made me feel like they really are in love but that their love is very 'practical' and that they really enjoy things like discussing business plans and budgeting together...that Kody comes to her for those types of discussions because she enjoys them as much as he does and that isn't the case with the other wives. It seems like she really feels like he respects her intelligence and that is a big part of what makes their connection work for her...and also that they just have love but are very reserved about it. She talked about how when she first joined the family Meri was touchy/feely with Kody like cuddling in the couch with him in the living room while all 3 were watching Tv and it hurt her pretty badly. She specifically referenced how Kody & Meri would share a long couch together while she would be alone on a two-seater sofa as their normal 'evening spots' while watching Tv. And it wasn't for a long time that it came to light as hurtful! Sort of a 'well you didn't ever say we were hurting your feelings if the two of us cuddle on the couch everynight while you sit over there alone!"" while she felt like it should have been obvious to them. Anyway, she said largely because of how hurtful those early days of feeling like  a 3rd wheel was for her, she's always been really cautious to never show public affection for the sake of respecting the other wives.  So I think that combined with how she's just calmer and more ""practical"" and less outwardly emotional makes people feel like their marriage is cold but i'm not convinced that is really the case. At least it wasnt' back then these days...who knows. But I think Kody has a really low tolerance for emotional labor...which is of course such a disaster in plural marriage!

stepparents,fit0ehw,t1_fir18lf,1582699304.0,"I had this exact issue as a kid. I couldn't eat my grandma's frozen waffles. I get that it sounds completely ridiculous but I wasn't making it up or choosing to be a brat. I didn't understand it enough to explain it back then but it was a texture sensitivity. My grandma didn't toast the waffles enough so after having butter/syrup added they would be too soft and it would squick me out, make me feel like I was going to gag, I couldn't make myself swallow them. The same thing would happen if they had gotten a bit freezer burnt and then *were* well toasted, the freezer-burned side would still be a bit mushy due to the ice crystals melting on that area. I had similar issue with soups/pastas having to be done just the right amount, scrambled eggs having to be what most would say is over-cooked to not be 'slimey', etc but i didn't really understand it I just knew it was 'yucky' this time and not last time. So there was a lot of 'you ate eggs last week! There is no reason you can't eat these.' type frustrations and I remember thinking 'i know but last week they weren't gross and these ones are!' and that was it - I didn't realize it was because they were 'more wet' so I couldn't express that. The aversion to the textures was super strong, too - not something I could just choose to ignore. I truly just could not make myself eat thins. I was a people-pleaser so I desperately wished that I could just eat things to avoid making people frustrated or mad at me. I had a lot of anxiety about eating at parties or social events because I hated the negative attention that came with being unable to eat certain foods. There was a lot of guilt/shame in it for me because I knew my picky eating frustrated people and that made me think I was 'bad'. But I just couldn't force it, the aversion was super strong. I say 'was' but I still have texture issues now but once you cook for yourself it doesn't matter. So I would agree with others that it's not a bad idea to teach and/or encourage picky eaters to prepare foods themselves as soon as they're safely able so they can control for those factors that matter to them."

Anyway...I sort of wonder if *part* of why Christine's role in the family afer Robyn changed was because Robyn didn't want her kids parented by the other women because of the differences in how they parent and if that left Christine feeling super out of place. Of course the general jealousy was a bigger part of what caused Christine's issues but I wonder if she never felt like she could really parent Robyn's kids the way she was able to parent the rest also created a wedge in the sense of family with multiple moms."

 Our beautiful baby daughter Evie has been diagnosed with FATCO syndrome (basically the abbreviation for lots of intense Latin words😅). It’s a rare medical syndrome where bones in extremities do not fully develop.  
. .  
It wasn’t a complete surprise; we were aware of some abnormalities before birth. We knew something was wrong when we went in for a routine anatomy ultrasound at 26 weeks and what should have taken 45 minutes, ended up lasting a nerve-wracking two hours. It was then that the doctor told us that they couldn’t find all ten fingers and diagnosed the baby with oligodactyly (fewer than 10 fingers). Although this was better than expected, it was still heartbreaking news.  
.  
But when Evie was born, Caleb and I found out our precious little girl was missing more than just one finger. She was missing three fingers, a toe and her fibula. She also had a bowed tibia, a shortened forearm and some fusing in her fingers. It was at this point, the doctors diagnosed her with FATCO syndrome.  
.  
We were hesitant to share Evie’s condition publicly for fear that our infant daughter would become the target of mean jokes and cyberbullying. That said, we felt not being open would be even worse and make Evie feel ashamed for something that makes her all the more special in our eyes. .. As far as we have been told, with fewer than 10 recorded cases of her specific findings, it’s unclear what causes the condition. She is healthy in every other way aside from the missing bones. As a family, we have decided to be open as we walk through this journey. We want Evie to always feel pride in who she is, and all that God gave her!"

They were in their very early 20's at the time so it was *a lot* to put on their plates but they handled it well, both were really upset for me and supportive of me and to this day (I'm 28) i tell them stuff I don't tell my bio parents because they've just always been people I can be emotionally vulnerable with in a safe way. So even if her bioparents never give you credit for being her #1 supporter during this, I bet she will remember and your relationship will be better as a result."
stepparents,ffxznzz,t1_ffxo3v3,1580335608.0,"I was abused by my stepbrother when I was about 7 and he was about 14 but I didn't tell anyone for years because I didn't have anyone who I felt close enough to to tell. It came out when I was in therapy at 13 because the school caught on that I was cutting myself. My stepbrother had some (relatively mild) special needs so it was largely a ""oh well you were both kids...he was mentally more like a 11 or 12 year old"" thing and that is such bullshit. It still enrages me to this day. Think about how twins play the ""i'm two minutes older!"" game or how much a 2 or 3 year age gap between siblings makes a differece in their relationship dynamics...the older one always has the upper hand. Kids know that age is the pecking order and a 5 year age gap is a LOT to a young child. A 10-year-old can seem like a near-adult to a 5 year old.  

I hope a therapist can help your husband to see how much he's harming his daughter by not seeing her trauma here. It can really compound the trauma to have your parents not care. He's very likely damaging his relationship with her forever right now even if he's bee a model father in every other way he's absolutely failing her because of this and this alone. Every little girl who is abused wants their daddy to be mad as hell on their behalf. It shouldn't seem like the ""easier"" thing for him to do nothing. He should be so hurt and angry for her that brushing it under the rug would be torture for him."

stepparents,fdm261l,t3_elzwy0,1578538024.0,"Him saying he can parent your son however he sees fit is a scary level of entitlement in my view. Another way of putting that is he doesn't care if you consent to how he treats your child. That is not okay at all. Aso your comment about how he says ""this is *his* house"" if you try to turn off the TV is controlling behavior and also a red flag. Your other comments mention how he makes you feel dismissed...and just the overall tone of this post is that he isn't even willing to have a mature discussion or negotiate parenting styles with you whatsoever. He doesn't value you as an equal partner. 

& it's really unhealthy to tell a child to suck it up when they're having emotions of whatever type. I'm not saying your child has emotional issues but even if he legitimately had emotional issues and was overly-emotional you would need to get him help with learning healthy coping methods for emotions. Telling a child to 'suck up' their feelings does nothing but make them repress. My guess is that he is basically 'triggered' by your sons crying and twists it around and puts the blame on your child as if he is being naughty or manipulative. Don't let him put his own issues onto your child. That's a big deal but I think the bigger deal is that he's just a bad partner and this relationship just doesn't sound healthy for any of you."

ABraThatFits,fbspdq9,t1_fbosa77,1577058360.0,"I definitely have continued to be confused by the cup sizes from US to UK.

If I want to stay in a 30 band but go up a cup size (this bra tag says it is 30DD US size and 30DD uk size) what size would I need in Us size and UK size? 

Yes most regular t-shirt bras are not ideal for me, as I'm not as shallow as they are designed for. but others recommended this particular one (Fantaise rebecca or panache cari) because they are moulded but not lined or something like that so they are supposed to adapt to your shape a bit better than most t-shirt bras I guess. The only others I've been recommended at my size/shape are all ones that would show through shirts due to lace and/or stitching and I don't want my bra to show through my clothes so I feel like i'm between a rock and a hard place. :-/"

Yeah I'm thinking that makes a lot of sense that the issue may be the band being too big and the cup being too small. Today I tried wearing it on the tightest hook (which I know I shouldn't be able to fit in a new bra) and in some ways it felt more comfortable that way..less rubbing on the far sides of my ribs. But more rubbing on the center of my chest between my boobs.  I also felt like the back of the band was riding up a little which might be causing the gore to sort of dig in at a weird angle as well...so that might be fixed with a smaller band. Unfortunately this bra doesn't come in a 28 band. I had success with a 28E (Uk size) in freya size-wise but it was a shape-mismatch (too projected and made for more narrow roots than I have) so people recommended me this bra or a panache cari in 30DD or a cleo marcie in a 30DD based on my boob shape. So I might try the panache or cleo bras in a 28E UK or 28F US how that brand does make a smaller band. Not sure which cup size to go with because the 28E freya did seem to fit fine and actually gapped a bit even. 

A concern i've had is whether the cups (well, underwires) might be too wide for me and if that could be part of why i'm feeling the wires against my ribs more so than the band feeling too tight overall? But I don't know if that makes any sense it's just a thought that occurred to me because it doesn't feel like the band is too tight around my whole underbust I just feel the wires pushing into me so I thought maybe the underwire size/shape could be the issue? No idea if that's how it works or not though."

I feel like pressing between my boobs near the top and I also feel it on either side sort of rubbing against my ribs. My ribs don't stick out in most positions but it feels like the band is just really hugging my one rib on each side of my body, sort of where my sides curve into my front. I don't know why it's rubbing in those spots so badly. 

If anyone knows why this bra would be sitting on me instead of supporting me please advise. With the digging on my ribs it almost makes me wonder if the band is too small but with my loose measurement being 29 I really thought a 30 band should fit no question (I've had 28 bands fit in other brands)."

internetparents,f9zv3hm,t3_e78o1p,1575745715.0,"I think it's pretty easy to tell if someone is nervous IF you know them well. I can tell if someone is talking more/talking faster because they are nervous, or are quieter/more reserved because they are nervous IF I know how much they typically talk or how fast they typically speak, etc. Or even how much they typically fidget, etc. 

But when it's a stranger it's harder to tell because you don't know their norm. So if they are being very talkative, talking quickly, or barely talking at all, or fidgeting a lot, it can be assumed that is their normal as opposed to their anxious behavior. 

However, even when I can tell that someone is nervous  I don't criticize or judge them. I don't think there is ay shame in having anxiety. It just makes me feel bad for them or want to help them. So maybe that's something you can keep in mind is that even if people can tell that you are nervous that doesn't mean they are thinking anything bad about you."

I was attempting to challenge your way of using the phrase ""I want her to have the best."" Because that phrase is used as if you're talking about quality but I don't think that is really the case. 
I think what you mean is basically ""I want her to have the most expensive."" but that is not equal to 'the best' in my mind. Of course there can be some relationship between cost and quality but not always...and in the case of a ring, if you expect that a Moissanite can last a lifetime then there isn't really a need for better quality right? So it's all about price and a perception of financial or socials status but I don't think that actually means anything about what is actually 'best'."

I'm admittedly being harsh here but it's because it seems like you want to be encouraged to change your thinking. Is what you really mean by that...""I feel like the cheaper option is 'beneath her' or 'beneath us'? Because I tend to see people use that phrase when that's what they mean. I don't really see ""I want the best for her"" used when it's an objectively better thing like...""I just want my girlfriend to have the  best winter boots to keep her feet dry and warm."" It's seemingly always like....this name-brand purse or jewelry or something which is not objectively 'better' it's just socially viewed as the best and they want to be perceived as 'having the best' more so than they want to have good quality items. 

So..are you afraid that a moissanite wouldn't last her a lifetime so you want 'better' in that sense? Or are you insecure that it has a lesser ""status"" than diamonds?"

It made me wonder if she taught him about the curly girl method. It's for naturally wavy or naturally curly hair but it helps you to protect your natural hair texture so if you weren't doing that before it can make it seem like it makes your hair ""get curlier"" than it used to be. For example you stop brushing your hair except when in the shower because using a brush or comb on wavy or curly hair will flatten it out. But there are several aspects to it."
