worldnews,foq09vs,t3_g8gu3w,1587978285.0,"Shrooms changed my life. I went through a lot of trauma when  I was a kid. Sexual abuse.  Taking mushrooms showed me what I was suppressing and I was able to go back to one of the traumatic events and go through it with the mind of an adult, not a 10 year old boy. I stopped what happened to me in my trip (almost rewrote history in my own mind) . This lead me to being able to open up to family and close friends as well as go to therapy and accept things that happened.

I was 26, and depresses. Before that time I would push away anyone that got close to me. I'm now 30 and in a much better place. Im still working through things. But if it wasn't for psilocybin, I'd be way behind.

This is by NO means an endorsement. Everyone is different. However poeple who are willing to open up and take whatever comes can benefit from psychedelics. There's a lot of work to follow be worth it.

I can only imagine how much good this would have in a proper theraptuic setting."

therapy,fm098ct,t3_fs1qka,1585649697.0,"Hey there,

First off, I'm so sorry you have had these experiences.

I went through a lot of childhood trauma as a child. My older brother startee molesting me when I was around 10 years old. I tried overdosing when I was young a few times and never got the support needed from my family. I pushed everyone away. Didn't allow people to be kind to me and never trusted a soul. I didn't tell them until I was 26.

All I can say is I'm now 30 years of age. I have been going to therapy now for a few years and this made a huge impact on my life. A lot of the time, we blame ourselves as children. Forgetting we were kids and were completely powerless.

Now you have the power to start something. To start a change in your life. Weather that be going to therapy or just taking those small steps towards healing.

I wish you all the peace in the world, find your own God. All the love x"

therapy,fl4rafb,t3_fmfz9z,1584819630.0,"Two words.. Transactional analysis

a system of popular psychology based on the idea that one's behaviour and social relationships reflect an interchange between parental (critical and nurturing), adult (rational), and childlike (intuitive and dependent) aspects of personality established early in life.

Google it. Spend some time thinking about what this means to your day to day transactions with your freins and loves ones and where both your transactions sit within these groups . Are you coming from a rational place (adult) a nurturing or cortolling place (parent) or dependent or angry (child)

It's important to give people the chance to respond how they choose. If you yourself approach the situation in the adult state, then a you can do is give other people the opportunity to do the same. If they don't you know you've done everything you can.

Hope this helps break things down a bit. It can be applied to every transaction throughout the day. It really helped me look at myself and the way I was either approaching or responding to poeple while I was going to therapy for childhood trauma.
