bipolar,fq6kpog,t3_gh213q,1589133388.0,Thank you for giving me hope!
AdultSelfHarm,fo7wbfq,t3_g5y1jz,1587585651.0,"Vitamin E oil (you can buy the capsules and open them if you can't find it in a jar), those flat silicone scar sheets, bio-oil, years ago for unrelated scarring they had me use this sticky gel that was some kind of silicone gel for raised scarring. Keeping everything moustuized helps too. I sunscreen over scarring that will be in the sun, and years later on some of my oldest ones, I had most of my left arm tattooed so I don't have to look at them all the time but if you do that, you should only do it on scars that have been healed for a few years."
ptsd,fnvd2nx,t3_g42r3d,1587288735.0,I have three fans and music on my phone running right now and absolutely can't sleep without white noise
Anxiety,fnvbpli,t3_g3z40y,1587287274.0,I took my temperature after running up a few flights of stairs with my dog and felt too hot today
AskWomen,fnvaavd,t3_g3wupt,1587285805.0,I wear it most days that I'm not crying too much. I used to tell my friends to bury me with my eyeliner. I like doing fancy eye makeup because it's one of my few creative outlets/things I do just for myself sometimes. I play music and take my time and it's a nice break from everything. I've been doing my own makeup for half my life. It also makes me feel better about myself and people are nicer to me in public. My two biggest dislikes is that I still haven't found a waterproof mascara that really holds up to crying and that my doctor doesn't take me as seriously about my mental illness severity if I wear makeup to med checks.
CozyPlaces,fnk9gfj,t1_fnk8r79,1587019110.0,!! That exact thing happened to me except I forgot what I was drinking that night
Dabs,fl9esjp,t3_fna8qn,1584952402.0,Mine's going down. I have asthma and I'm paranoid as shit about stressing my lungs so I've cut both size and frequency and have been trying to be really careful with temperatures
piercing,fkzrut1,t3_flluqa,1584678542.0,You're a cool dad!
AdultSelfHarm,fdj5ufd,t1_fd1nq2s,1578459281.0,Oh no is it like a Thing where they won't use anesthetic for self injury? The one time I needed stitches my regular doctor was appalled that they used such large sutures and they refused to give me a local anesthetic and my doctor basically said if I ever need stitches again to come to him.
StopSelfHarm,fczygau,t3_ejqx1c,1578110790.0,Proud of you!!

ambien,f7r7ijx,t3_dvm9bw,1573976221.0,Started it about eight years ago but was banned from it for a few years and back on for probably three years?
AMA,f7n2yix,t3_dwzm1l,1573882264.0,I am tired of hearing High Hopes eight times a day on the radio here. I think it's not one of their good ones. Please tell me I'm not just a bad fan for getting annoyed and changing the station if it's That song. I've liked the since middle school but that song just bothers me
AskWomen,f6gsm2h,t3_dqyft6,1572829959.0,Yesterday. She has no concept of personal space.

Dabs,f3ab4r9,t3_dg9p7a,1570766754.0,"This is going to sound bad but uh for a while even at lower temps, I kept coughing hard enough to bleed and wheezing. It turns out I have asthma and now that I'm on a daily asthma medication I can do dabs again without it being awful."

EatingDisorders,eyjujjq,t3_cx9x3l,1567128625.0,Years ago my best friend told my parents about my eating disorder and self-harming. I was so hurt and angry and betrayed. He probably saved my life and is still my best friend to this day. I have sisters. I think you did the right thing but it probably sucks for everyone right now
ptsd,exrfzle,t3_cu1pe0,1566516070.0,I love my partner but sometimes sharing a bed is just too much so I sleep on the floor or the couch
ptsd,exrfvxe,t3_cu1pe0,1566516010.0,If it's people I don't know very well I just say I don't like to be touched if they get too close or touchy. With people closer to me I ask them to ask about contact. Once in a while I can relax and enjoy cuddles and touch but everyone has to ask first and I can say no
nosleep,es82toh,t3_c5you5,1561686525.0,Thank you so much for including a clearly worded content warning at the top!
ambien,eq5jqlt,t3_bu4bwt,1559803516.0,Ambien/razor blades equals no bueno. I got banned from ambien for three years after that ER trip. Be safe friendo. You're not alone
