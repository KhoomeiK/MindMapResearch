If its habitat is still the same as it used to be, it might be able to survive. Then there is the question of predators. Are there any left who could eat the worm or are there any new species which could use it as a source of food? What does the worm eat and is that stuff still available? If not, is there a new food source available? 

Ok, I looked at the wikipedia thing (had to check what 'worm' means in this context). So, since we're talking nematodes, I'd say there's chance they might survive if you introduced them back into the wild. Those bitches eat algae, bacteria and other simple shit that is still available as a food source today. (There are also parasitic nematodes which are more specialized for obvious reasons.)If the nematode is not highly specialized in one particular food source, I'm guessing it should be fine. There might be other nematodes though, if both use the same source of food, it's gonna be a problem. I don't have a source for that, but nematodes have tons of predators. But that has also been the case 40,000+ years ago, so I don't know if that makes any difference, unless the number of predators is significantly higher that it used to be. I don't know. The only thing left would be that I'm not sure which environment I'd want to release the nematodes to. I'm too lazy to look up what the climate was like back then and if it was already permafrost. But if that nematode was able to survive being frozen for such a long time I'd say it could be adapted to cold weather, just like water bears are. 

Now I'm asking myself if many nematodes can survive harsh environments like that one did, maybe it is just the first time that we observed it. And I'd also like to know if they can multiply after being thawed.

PS: I'm no nematode expert."

weightgain,f4r5v65,t1_f4qwwhx,1571763204.0,">it’s a similar idea to those people who stress eat

This is so true!! I am always using this example when I'm trying to explain my situation to other people. They usually still don't understand because it's not that common. 

2 years ago I was down to 92lbs (I am also a tiny person) and I just started a new job and for the first 3 months people would constantly comment on my weight and how little I eat. It made me furious, because I don't go to a fat person and say ""You look fat, have you ever thought about eating a bit less?"", but for some reason commenting on my weight and telling me I should eat more is ok?! God damn it. 

These comments don't interest me anymore nowadays. Last week my coworker asked me if I gained some weight and it made me happy (I didn't, still made me happy)

I've been able to hold my weight with only little problems for a year. My eating is still super fucked up, but it is a start. 

>dealing with my anxiety/depression translates to me constantly stress starving.

Yeah that has been one of my main issues as well, because it's stupid circle. You don't eat enough, so you feel bad, you feel bad, so you don't eat enough. It is a constant battle. I'm always trying to be aware of the problem. Many small meals so I don't feel overwhelmed by a full plate. And I've stopped beating myself up when I can't finish a meal. I just take it home and try again later. (Sometimes I take it home and simply forget about its existence)

One thing I was always able to eat and where I used to get most of my calorie-intake was chocolate. Even though you gotta chew it. I don't know why. 

I've started taking antidepressants a while ago and I'm hoping that this'll help me to get rid of some stress, so I can eat again. I've already had like two meals that tasted absolutely delicious and it was FUN to eat. Still couldn't eat a lot, but I at least enjoyed it, so that was nice. 

If you want to, keep me updated how it went with your therapist! I really hope it'll help!!"
