depression,flq8qvp,t1_flq8p52,1585383916.0,"Thanks man, I’ll keep my eyes peeled for you next time I have an existential crisis."
depression,flq8n5n,t1_flq8idy,1585383784.0,I hope so I appreciate you helping me out through this. It’s nice to voice these things to new people.
depression,flq88z9,t1_flq82ti,1585383286.0,What worth is derived from the self? I mean seriously what do I matter compared to everybody else that hurts 10 times worse then me. I get that I can’t do that for my own health and for this “cause” but I just can’t stop it’s always on my mind.
depression,flq7smh,t1_flq7kfo,1585382716.0,"Most of the time I’m fine, it’s just that I’m dating this girl who’s had it 100 times worse then me. Like half her family died in less then a year. I was happy for a while dating her. I helped her out and I felt good. Now she’s hurting beyond my control and I feel like shit for not being able to do anything, it’s awakened my own personal shit too. I’m no longer happy with her. 

I did this same shit with someone who once was my best friend( like a literal brother to me) and we don’t talk anymore. 

Sorry if that mess doesn’t answer your question."
depression,fcjraqi,t1_fcjqjyo,1577700686.0,"Thanks for the insight man, it’s really appreciated."
depression,fcjq6d1,t1_fcjpyhe,1577699054.0,"I’ve been going to CBT for a year or two now but I still find myself going back to it. I wouldn’t say it’s a betrayal of the old self as much as it is a feeling of “well, who I am?” I know I’ve grown and changed as a person since then but I don’t know how."
depression,fcjpxrj,t1_fcjp657,1577698714.0,Exactly! It’s all about things being simple. I feel like bullying stunted me both mentally and emotionally that now what could possibly be mundane relationship issues are totally foreign to me.
television,fcjnphn,t1_fcj1pcp,1577695546.0,I’d recommend starting from either The Color of Magic or Guards! Guards!
depression,fad0w61,t1_fad06g8,1575952016.0,"I’ve got a good life honestly. I go to a nice enough school, I’ve got my whole life ahead of me (I’m only 16),  my friends are dickheads but hey that’s growing up right? 

I have OCD and Depression (I am diagnosed but I’m not any medical treatment because I don’t have much of an inclination to hurt myself).

I was also heavily beaten/bullied from elementary school to late middle school. 

Although I was beaten down I feel like I lead a very privileged life, that’s why I feel bad for feeling like this.

I only talk with my therapist and a counseling group about my issues, I only tell my friends about stuff I feel like it could help them with their issues."
depression,f86vws8,t1_f5wrddx,1574308243.0,"Jesus. I’ve never related more to anything then this. I’ve got good grades, an okay group of friends, and a wonderful girlfriend but at the end of the day I just don’t care.

I struggle to get up every morning because it just isn’t worth it but then when I get out of the shower and I find myself off to school suddenly I am the picture of health. The second I get home though I find myself struggling but not struggling enough. Like you said I don’t feel sick enough. 

Every god damn thing is a struggle, every little inch of ground I’ve painstakingly fought for feels worthless. I just feel so fucking entitled yet bored with my life. I have no idea who I am, I have no idea what I stand for, and I have no idea what I even want to do with myself. I struggle to get up because what is their for me to do? Go to school and deal with the same god damn people I’ve known all my life? Go back to getting my shit kicked in by bullies who acted like they were my best friends? Or deal with my parents who are just constantly at each other’s throats? 

I just want to leave. I just want to get high and go out on the open road with nothing but myself and what I can fit in the back of a truck and just get out. I just want out."
