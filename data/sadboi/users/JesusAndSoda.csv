If any dark, hopeless, self-hating or dirty thoughts come to her mind, encourage her to cut them off and immediately counter and replace them. Something like:

""I hate my stupid school and myself for...""
""I'm going to get this done so I can take a rest, then get to the bottom of where these thoughts are coming from soon enough.""

Just know three things: she'll have to do this several times as the thoughts keep coming every few seconds or minutes (upwards of a dozen, even a hundred, times in a row), this is only temporary for energy boosting until she can get to the source of the thoughts and attack them there, and make sure the replacement thought isn't some kind of self-deceptive affirmation (""I'm the best and everyone loves me!"") because those just create a mental fantasy world that will crash her down hard when she doesn't measure up in the real world. Stick with honest optimism or confident grit.

Good luck to you both!!"

Most of those memories were only semi-planned as you said here, basically just throwing a dart at a city map and going there to see what was up, and the fun came out from those experiences.

If all the things I mentioned are tough for you, I can understand the complete confusion. If I could offer any kind of support from my experiences, I would say the best thing you could do is to set up a foundational sense of your base identity to get the basics covered.

Things like honor, kindness, adventurousness, patience, grace, any list of traits you'd like to fold in is an excellent starting point.

I'm not a behavioral psychologist or anything like that, but I have managed to slowly overcome things similar to what you describe (stark terror involving certain things, in my case it was darkness, social contact, failure and a few other things). For me, it was about slowly, very slowly, reintroducing those things into my life, or straight up throwing myself into them.

For example in the case of darkness, I sat myself in my grandma's pitch black room for about 30-60 minutes to get used to it, and now I prefer the dark to the brightness.

But for social practice, I babystepped. My first convo with a girl I didn't know was about 30 seconds before I bailed, then the next I tried to go for 60, until I slowly worked my way up to 5 minute combos.

If one of these two methods seems ok for you to try, you could ask someone you trust to hug you for 5 straight minutes like the first example. Or for the second, you could do a quick high five, take a break. Then fingers touch, take a break. Then one pump handshake, take a break, until you work up to something you feel best with.

- Tell him you'll be near if he needs you, and not initiate contact anymore. Keep your lines open through email, phone and the rest so if he needs help you're ready to hear him, but leave first contact to him

And if there are any thoughts saying you can't do it, try your best to confront, counter and replace them.

\- Bring up your troubles to your loved ones and friends, but in a positive and solution-focused way like ""Hey guys I have a problem, can we talk a while, see if you can't help me out a bit? I want to get this fixed"". It's much more likely for people to want to jump in and help with these kinds of words.

\- Keep your troubles to yourself, but secretly do some kind of therapy in your private moments (either with a pro, which is best, or self-administered like I did back in college, doing therapy on myself with thought examination and correction). This way, your loved ones can be an oasis of peace, strength, kindness and love, while you spare them the trouble of your private battle, where you take the fight to depression on your own time and terms.

\- Get you ready for the therapy process before you can talk to a real pro  
\- Tide you over until the waiting period is over, emotionally and mentally  
\- Get some things ready to share with the pro so you can hit the ground running when you start meeting

Whatever you do though, I hope it involves nothing but good, and anything but trying to take your life. I don't think anyone wants that for you."
depression,fqppro5,t3_gk9ca4,1589551662.0,I'm very sorry about your past. Are you currently far away from the people and things that hurt you? I wasn't able to slowly deal with the darkness of my childhood until I was far removed from all the people and places in it.
depression,fqppj2e,t3_gk9bxq,1589551529.0,"That's some of the worst depression to happen when it seems to come from nowhere and hit from the shadows. Have you had any physical tests done to check for uneven brain chemistry, anemia, genetic issues or other physical reasons like this? Or do you think it might be more cognitive, like not knowing your own identity, not having future goals in place, overanalyzing everything in your life and assuming the worst is going to come, or agreeing with thoughts of hopelessness or fear? It's insidious, wherever it comes from..."
depression,fqppbhm,t3_gk95uz,1589551410.0,"My pleasure, thank you for putting it out there. My friends didn't know what to do with me in my suicidal depression either, and after months of them not knowing how to help, I felt real lost.

Eventually I stumbled into cognitive therapy and started self-administering it when I was alone... which let my friends be my oasis from the rough confrontations I was having with my own mind. They didn't know what I was doing and I never told them, but them just being there to eat pizza, watch WWF, tell ghost stories... that helped me more than they knew."
depression,fqpp1op,t1_fqpoa04,1589551257.0,"Ya pretty much haha. I think enemies in vidya took the worst of my rage thankfully, but my friends got it once or twice too. :/"
depression,fqpoxn9,t3_gk95eh,1589551195.0,"That's excellent he's doing so much for you, I had friends who helped me much without even knowing themselves how important they were to me, just like your lil nephew.

From what I understand, some meds can truly zonk you out and send you through life like a zombie in the clouds, but others seem to more likely smooth out the rough edges and make things easier to get along with. You can check with a doc and switch meds if they aren't going quite the way you want, or if therapy is more with your particular case, you might be able to bypass the meds and take aim at any mind issues directly. With doc's recommendations, of course."
depression,fqpooqw,t3_gk8uex,1589551055.0,"I know the feeling. Is it a lack of motivation, or more of a lack of reason/feeling that success is deserved that is holding you back, or something else? It sucks either way, I know."
depression,fqpoitu,t3_gk8swn,1589550963.0,"Whatever is standing between you and reacquiring those feelings of happiness, may they get identified, confronted and removed for good right quick, bud. Real talk."
depression,fqpof1q,t3_gk8q4a,1589550902.0,"From my experience, it doesn't get better on its own. And not looking to the future is indicative of this kind of thinking, like our minds heal like cuts on a hand so why worry. The only thing I found that helped me personally was to root out the sources of the pain and take direct aim at them through direct action and babystepping.

""It gets better"" works for the blues, not depression. If anything, time makes depression slide further down, if my experience is anything to go by."
depression,fqpo4bx,t3_gk8o4k,1589550732.0,Sure thing. Mine was a heavy case of Freudian displacement (taking my frustrations out on people and things that had nothing to do with the underlying causes).
depression,fqpo0of,t3_gk8mab,1589550674.0,"Sorry I don't know about meds, but I just wanted to say it's excellent you're looking for ways to support and help yourself, and not only this, but having other backup plans in place (If Cym doesn't work, then Aur, then maybe something else). It really shows your inner strength and organized attention to problem solving. :)

Anyway, hope you get some good info from others on the meds, bud."
depression,fqpnv22,t3_gk8l99,1589550583.0,"I'm very sorry about what happened with your dad. I hope that you have been able to get some of the pain sorted out since it happened, or at least made good headway with it.

I've had physical symptoms from depression too, but mine was localized in my shoulders and stomach. It's possible yours could be resulting from muscle tension or mental strain as well."
depression,fqoklkr,t1_fqo8jp7,1589517447.0,"No problem, bud. Love your username btw. :D"
depression,fqo2623,t1_fqmxdf8,1589506041.0,"Cool, I hope you get some even better links soon. Sometimes we have to tamp down the things we like until we get to know people better (stick with movies and food before talking about steampunk, for example), but if someone isn't interested in your stuff even after getting acquainted, you don't have to keep chasing after them and should try someone else.

I hope you can get the root cause of the social anxiety singled out to make this search far quicker and more efficient."
depression,fqo1s1r,t1_fqmkmct,1589505815.0,"External pressure on the core is the worst. The meds are in good place for that potential genetic issue you mentioned, so if there is a way to fix (or leave behind) those toxic relationships, I hope you find the best way."
depression,fqm0uwj,t1_fqm08is,1589469555.0,"Right, wisely said. I'm no dentist and my only experience with tooth health is slowly healing minor cavities with the paleo diet (aka no bread or sugar to mess up chem balance), but if I had anything to suggest it would be go paleo and hope that supports your teeth long enough till the lockdown passes and you can get that surgery, preferably spending the time you have now to do some good research finding the best doc for the cheapest price somewhere. Hope everything works out for you, bud."
depression,fqm0lmm,t1_fqlz8ne,1589469426.0,"Accept for now, yes, but keep your eyes on the excellent goal you had earlier. I think distilling your dream job down to the two goals of ""away from home"" and ""with best friends"" are key here. If you could try to get one of the two in place in the near future, like move away to get a job and eventually make new friends, or move in with your old friends, but near your home at some whatever-who-cares job while still being with them, that would be 50% of the way. Don't let the dream stay mental!! :D"
depression,fqlypok,t3_gjna31,1589468480.0,"I had to go back to square one after job failures and move back home to a bad childhood home (not saying yours is bad, mine was), so I understand about having to go back. I felt some of the anxiety and depression you mention here, but mine was largely blunted and kept strongly distant from me because I had powerful and focused plans on what to do to get me out of the 'rents house and back to looking for work. It took me 2 years to save the scratch I needed to move out again, but for most of that time, I was either out with friends or working so I minimized contact at home. This may be a good way through this for you, if the lockdown isn't preventing your progress."
depression,fqlydhy,t3_gjn9dk,1589468309.0,"Would having a dentist visit to another country for a lower price help with the money issue? Would tooth remineralization through the paleo diet be able to help this issue, or possibly make the price less by slowly closing some holes, anything like that?"
depression,fqly36x,t3_gjn7m7,1589468162.0,"Is it something physical that's going wrong? If so, I hope it's cureable or at least treatable, and you have some good plans on how to get that healing or relief to you."
depression,fqly084,t3_gjn1j0,1589468121.0,"Thanks very much for the well wishes. I hope you continue on with this good advice to get things handled on your end, and also try to get the source of those self-hating thoughts found out to build your foundations as well as possible. Failure happens, even if we set ourselves up."
depression,fqlxpui,t3_gjmwq1,1589467974.0,"I had crippling social anxiety due to a Diablo 2 addiction in high school, and my troubles were largely related to cognitive habits of self-hatred, believing I didn't deserve a girlfriend, fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of judgement, a lack of a defined and personal identity, a lack of practice with talking to others, hyperoveranalysis of every potential future problem to the point I assumed the worst would always happen, and weakness of the body and charm that made me think I would always fail.

But once I got the issues identified, I was able to slowly start taking aim at them to fix them up one by one. If you have anything you can pinpoint causing this fear, I hope you can get it rooted out as well."
depression,fqlxf9e,t1_fqlx9za,1589467826.0,"Counselor may be better then, especially since suicidal ideation is involved. If this keeps up for several more months or years, you may actually end up attempting in the future, and nobody wants you to do that, bud."
depression,fqlxbjs,t3_gjmvru,1589467775.0,"The haze may be autopilot as you go through the boring motions of the day, but I don't know much about the sudden rushes of invincible energy that blast in. It might be related to the energy of your youth, or the upwaves of chronic depression before the lowpoints come in (since you mentioned this earlier on), but I'm more concerned about the depression itself. Wherever that's coming from, I hope you can get it identified and removed for good."
depression,fqlx0hv,t3_gjmle8,1589467619.0,"It sounds like things aren't going too well, but I fear they may slide into worse things in the future like mine did. I would have a talk with your mom, or barring that, see a counselor at school to see if they have any ideas, because hitting yourself and thinking of death at this age is not healthy at all."
depression,fqlwo8w,t3_gjml5v,1589467445.0,"It's good she responded well to the therapy. You might want to ask later on if she wants to keep up pro help for continuous help if she got good results from it, but I recommend you try your best to get things back to normalcy to provide a stable environment for her to continue growing up in. Whatever good things you were doing before, keep them up, maybe do them a bit more, so she feels like she's truly back home again."
depression,fqlwh9l,t1_fqltt7o,1589467345.0,How much longer do you have before you can graduate/get the money needed to move out? Hopefully you're a legal adult so there's no issues with you making your own way.
depression,fqlwcq7,t3_gjmi97,1589467280.0,"It's an excellent question to ask. Have you been able to narrow it down to something physical like uneven brain chemistry or genetic/family history, or if it's something more related to a dark past, agreeing with self-hatred long enough for it to become a pattern, hyperoveranalysis of everything in life, or anything like that?"
depression,fqlw86k,t3_gjmhc4,1589467215.0,"Is it the virus keeping you from making the good links that could really help out right now, or something deeper? It's good to have a bigger net to go around in case of trouble like this, so hopefully little to nothing is standing between you and that good goal."
depression,fqlvi4a,t3_gjmbiy,1589466837.0,"If it's not related to something underlying and far more sinister like chronic anxiety or something, on the surface level I can recommend viewing your current situation as a stepping stone to something better in the future, being content where you are now to build skill and heart while you prepare yourself for the next level. Is the dream job still on the table in the future, and do you have good ideas on steps to close the gap between you and it someday?"
depression,fqlvckq,t3_gjlmmr,1589466756.0,"If you're talking about Borderline tendencies, I suffered with that for years. Do you have a solid lock on the kind of person you are, without others defining or judging you to be a certain way? I don't know about others, but my co-dependency on others' opinions led me to be beholden to their every word and action, and destabilized my sense of self with every rejection or change of mind."
depression,fqlv3cw,t1_fqkath4,1589466620.0,"That's an excellent lead. I think the other side of this might be getting that kind of insulting static from people saying you're no good. As long as you start from square one and track slow improvements on some kind of skill, hobby or work you're trying to get better at, you're doing exactly what you should be doing.

People constantly dangling the endgame you haven't reached, vs. tacking stock of your improvements hurts more than helps. Whoever they are, if they won't be bargained with to calm down and stop saying things like that, I hope you can reduce contact until they shape up. You don't need to pine for the affections of people who talk like that."
depression,fqk9ctm,t1_fqjbhlj,1589422679.0,"Is doing a gap year to make cash, starting at a community college and transferring an option? Maybe trade school to pay less, study less and make more at nursing, maintenance or repair, that kinda thing?"
depression,fqk97af,t1_fqi1rdu,1589422588.0,"Ya, you're right. Not saying this is you at all because we all have different roots, just using myself as an example of finding the source, but I had an ego problem on top of constant pessimistic thinking, as well as regret for the life I gave up all swirling around together.

But once I knew where it was all coming from, I was thankfully able to start looking into overturning things through CBT, goal adjustment, Matthew 7, babystepping... just a big shotgun approach. I hope you can pinpoint your sources well too, so you can get everything worked out."
depression,fqk8tl5,t1_fqi302u,1589422376.0,It really depends a lot on the root to al of this. Does anything here sound familiar?
depression,fqhpxiw,t1_fqhncvh,1589382031.0,"I see, you must have had it rough too. Mine came from taking failure too hard because I had too much of myself wrapped in my external goals and others' opinions and it went on for years. I hope whatever albatross is around your neck you can get it well and truly off, real talk."
depression,fqgudas,t3_giub4v,1589357443.0,"Keeping the schedule is pretty rough, I know. But if I can offer any kind of support, it's that once you get to the muscles/heart you want (within reason, not Superman or anything), it only takes one, maybe two sessions at the gym, or on your own, to upkeep the gains you made.

It took me about a year to go from benching+curling 10kg to 80kg and I had to work out 2-4 times a week to get where I am now. But now, just 5 sets a week in a single 10 minute session is enough to keep the reasonable size. So you can look forward to health, as well as easy routines, in the future."
depression,fqgu6ul,t3_giub3p,1589357268.0,"If they are pointing out bad things that are really bad and you fix them, that's admirable and great. You're getting stronger and more based every day and are moving more strongly to good things in the future, not for them as much as yourself.

But if people are just being picky and pointing out things that aren't a problem, you can just keep on the usual way, bud. Sometimes people just want to control others and will find any small reason to be like that."
depression,fqgu3ji,t3_giu9r5,1589357179.0,"Personal question and feel free to ignore, but are you recently or currently married or with kids? I had feelings exceedingly similar to what you describe here during the first few years of adjustment to life as a father and husband. That cycle, that work, all responsibility, all of it and more."
depression,fqgu0ak,t3_giu93p,1589357091.0,"Just as a hypothetical, would having an effect on the world, finding something you like to do and having a regular sense of self-care potentially make things look up overall for you? Or do you think it's something more akin to learned helplessness, the numbness of chronic depression or something similar that's robbing you of everything good, no matter what it is?"
