BPD,fjw3naf,t1_fjm4poa,1583634225.0,"Some days I'm just trying to do what needs to be done (in my own head) to stay above water. Let's say for example some customer at work treated me like garbage or made me feel stupid or inadequate. I'll come up with a story to make myself feel better, regardless of whether or not it's accurate so I don't spiral for weeks on end. I'm quiet BPD so none of these things ever get said, just pushed further and further in until I can feel better. I'm glad you're able to cope in a healthier way. I hope this explains my comment."
BPD,fjkmv86,t3_fdxnv9,1583429890.0,"I'm so like this. And now that I have kids I feel really guilty afterwards because in the past things I've done are equally as dangerous as what the other person has done. Like tailgating people who cut me off, following them to where they are going, etc. Something I'm working on is trying to come up with a story as to why the other driver is doing that thing. Like, if they are driving slow, they are lost or have recently been in an accident and are being cautious. Another coping mechanism for me is thinking about whether I will think about this incident tomorrow, or in a week, or in a month.  I don't remember most incidents where I did not physically react negatively, but I do remember and feel guilty for the ones where I did something."
BPD,fjkm9b5,t3_fdt3z1,1583429548.0,"This happens to me a lot. This probably isn't a healthy coping skill but I try to blame anyone else but myself for whatever the thing was until I'm feeling good enough to really re-evaluate the event and get closure.  Finding a bad guy that isn't myself helps me at least feel normal again for a little while and try to get past the bad. I hope you feel better soon, if you want to talk about it feel free to DM me."
BPD,fjklj99,t3_fdswzs,1583429147.0,"After I am happy with something I've done, or are like feeling positive about my partner and how wonderful they are, something terrible happens, or we get in a horrible fight and I wholly regret ever thinking positively. It's like I bring it on myself, but how?"

BPDmemes,fiabib9,t3_f778ow,1582297536.0,"When you try to approach them about it they invalidate your feelings and gaslight you, ""I would never say something like that."" Hey, yeah...about that."
BPD,fhyb6qs,t3_f5blry,1581972364.0,"Not much to add, but yes, this happens to me too.  I thought this was a positive coping mechanism, lol.. I guess I'll ask my therapist. I have one of those now!!"

BPD,fgmj9pf,t3_ezc0i0,1580925696.0,thanks for this! still having a hard time finding a therapist but would like to do some self-treatment in the meantime. do you have any recommendations for books or online worksheets? there's so many.
BPD,fg4fvx2,t3_ewtyzn,1580502626.0,"I've been going through a period like this too. I keep saying to myself, I can't even take one more setback and still function. I'm sorry life is total shit for you right now and it's really fucking hard to work and go to school. It took me 7 years to get through it. I hope something gives and things get a little better."
BPD,fg0wj2n,t1_fg0uszk,1580416413.0,Thank you for writing this :) i have a lot of trouble explaining what i need. This helps!

BPD,fff0q5p,t1_ffeedut,1579872463.0,6 months in a row is amazing! Good job. I hope DBT is helpful for you too!! Can't hurt to try it.
BPD,ffe487p,t3_et3yuz,1579836274.0,"I feel this so much. Is checking on him constantly going to keep him from doing what you're afraid of? Like cheating, or leaving? It's just putting unnecessary stress on yourself. With my then-BF (now husband) I had to really change my default mindset from ""I must know everything to protect me from getting hurt"" to ""everything is OK until proven otherwise"" because my actions can't control his. I hope that makes sense. Sorry if it doesn't!"
BPD,ffe2pks,t1_ffd8azc,1579835150.0,"this is great advice. not op, but this is so helpful. thank you for taking the time to write this!"
BPD,ffe21l2,t3_et01mi,1579834655.0,"it's not a fact! I know things are seeming shitty now, but it will change, things are always changing. I hope you find your receipt, that simple shit always gets to me so much, why is that?? I forget about it in a few weeks but in the moment it's big. I'm bad at advice but I wanted you to know that I care."
BPD,ffdz700,t3_et2s8a,1579832591.0,"Right there with you. I'm a 3 time therapy failure. Going to make my 4th attempt this month. I always seem to find a reason to like, complain about shit that doesn't matter at my appointments or manipulate situations that make me seem better than I am. I have no idea how to explain how I feel about things. I'm mostly just so empty inside now that I can't cry, and I keep myself so distracted with work so I don't have to think. I'm sick of talking about my father who abandoned me, right?"
BPD,ffdx5y0,t3_et2e3b,1579831135.0,yup yup yup

BPD,ff75zne,t3_eryieu,1579641798.0,"YES. And in any fight I always start off guns blazing and mad, but end up apologizing even if it's totally not my fault because I want the fight to end and still have them love me again."
BPD,ff72kwa,t3_ervqhe,1579639854.0,"YES. It feels so manipulative once I regain the self-awareness but like, I have no idea how to communicate my needs otherwise. I think I read somewhere (maybe here?) that BPD is like having the emotional intelligence  of a child and I feel that 100%. And being normal for my job makes me so fucking exhausted."
BPD,ff4rz86,t1_ff258i4,1579571021.0,"Some of our favorites are Pandemic (and Pandemic Legacy), Escape, Chronicles of Crime, Forbidden Desert, Rising 5. If you want something kind of silly and fun but competitive my favorite game at the moment is The Quacks of Quedlinberg. I've had so much fun playing that with him. I hope you guys find something that works for you!"
BPD,ff1xpjy,t3_er2um2,1579488562.0,"This used to be one of my triggers. We (try) to have set days & times to spend together. Other than watching Netflix, we do board games. It feels good to do something one-on-one, and especially games that are co-operative and we're working together towards a common goal. It feels like strengthening our relationship in a lot of ways. Sometimes competitive games are still a trigger for me because I dunno, like, if I win the game and he loses he might get mad at me and leave. Sounds silly now but at the time it feels real. Because we have our thing I feel better about having the together but apart time (which we're having right now, he's playing Destiny and I'm writing to strangers on reddit)."
BPD,ff1wh4k,t3_er57jg,1579487751.0,I wake up every morning and have to convince myself not to push people away even though at the same time I wake up feeling worthless and unlovable
BPDmemes,ff1ugng,t3_er5ed9,1579486448.0,Until you talk about that insecurity for the 1 millionth time a few years into your relationship/friendship and then they get sick of it and leave you and you always knew they would..

BPD,fenvur9,t3_eq3i57,1579291700.0,"I'm afraid of this! I'm in the process of finding a therapist and I'm worried about becoming attached to them and then like, becoming attracted to them and being unable to separate a normal therapist/patient relationship from a sexual one. This is why I need therapy."
BPD,fenuraq,t3_eq3c84,1579291127.0,"I lost one of my best friends because I exploded on them, accused of things that weren't true, but I was so seeing red and couldn't control all the things that had built up- real or imagined. I apologized after but I think the damage was done. We haven't talked in many years but I think about it a lot."
BPD,fenu401,t1_fen5qoi,1579290739.0,what assholes. sorry you had to grow up with that :(
BPD,fenpt2j,t3_epxlh6,1579289112.0,"Yes, I also haven't done anything physically in many years (a turning point for me was having to talk to my graduate school advisor with bandages on my wrists, then another was becoming a parent) but now when I'm frustrated or angry now I resort to overeating, and overspending/impulsive spending. I'm generally high functioning too, 9-5 job, side gig, parent, homeowner. I'm a perfectionist, which came from being a 'parent' and confidante at a young age to my mother. I just see red when I'm angry and want to punch the wall or smash a window to distract from wanting to cut or drink...then I usually just buy something on my credit card that I don't need or eat a ton of food to distract myself. One vice for another, until I can get into therapy I guess."
BPD,fennlur,t1_fedbacl,1579288280.0,I can feel myself starting to get over this now but if it's a long fight I eventually just give up and de-escalate it because I'm emotionally tired and stop caring.
BPD,fenmnxz,t1_feifol2,1579287956.0,"Yup..I can justify just about everyone elses emotions, feelings and motivations except my own and I don't even know what is real"

BPD,fekbny7,t3_epikyu,1579196679.0,"Yup, I have this too. My mom would cry to me about my dad and told me I was her only friend and her best friend. I was 12. I had to pick up the pieces and carry her through the separation and divorce until she met my step-dad when I was 15 and basically dumped me for him. It can get better, I didn't start reclaiming my life until I acknowledged the toxic codependent people/tendencies of my life.  It still pops up now and then but is moving towards the rear view (I'm in my 30s)."

BPDsupport,fahk317,t3_e9708m,1576087435.0,"New to the sub, but man, this seriously resonates with me. I also will tell myself that my friends pity me and that's why they are trying, so I should decline the invite. The lingering suicidal thoughts make me unable to have fun sometimes, so I don't think I'm fun to be around, so I think my friends don't actually like me- which becomes this vicious cycle. I never saw it as sabotage before, but you've really articulated these feelings well."
