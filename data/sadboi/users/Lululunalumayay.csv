If you were contacted and told that you encountered someone with a confirmed case, you must not leave your home for 2 weeks. You and your family would be waiting to see if you develop any symptoms. Need to keep in mind, if you end up going outside and develop any symptoms, you would need to note down every place you visited including the time of day, and provide that info to the health care provider to warn the public. 

If this was a decision made by your employer or just a personal choice for social distancing to stay home, you are definitely able to enjoy going to a park. 

Take care!"

Yea that's tough for me to decide.
So as someone in their 30s, it's a matter of: 
1. maybe it's a flu 2. maybe it's covid  3. will have to decide how long to quarantine myself 4. or go back to my daily life when the symptoms are tolerable 5. hope I don't infect elderly and others if it wasn't just the flu

that's a lot of guessing... :(

I did this because I kept thinking I was feeling better and assumed I no longer needed meds. I told my doctor everything, and he just mentioned that I stop skipping the meds. He didn't tell me that it was harmful to restart on my own. It was basically like missing a dose, except it was a months worth.

Perhaps take it even earlier in the evening. You could also put your alarm further away from your bed so that you'd have to get up to turn it off. I find that once you just sit up, the grogginess goes away. If your work is flexible, maybe you can ask to start work later in the day.

It takes a lot of trial and error and effort. Hang in there! I assumed the sleepiness would go away overtime and I didn't sort things out until it took a toll on my career. Hopefully you'll find what works best for you sooner than later.
