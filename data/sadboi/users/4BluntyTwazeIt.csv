(I): Crimewave, Magic Spells, Courtship Dating
(II): Celestica, Baptism, Suffocation
(III): Plague, Pale Flesh, Insulin
Amnesty: Fleece, Sadist, Concrete


That was hard to do, I enjoy 80-90% of their music so just 3 wasn't enough. My best friend would play Crimewave in her car and I enjoyed the edm aspect of it because I was heavily into techno in high school. Listened to the rest of the first (and only album they had out at the time) and was instantly hooked. I've only barely skimmed the surface of the ""witch house"" genre, and thoroughly enjoyed what I've discovered so far."
