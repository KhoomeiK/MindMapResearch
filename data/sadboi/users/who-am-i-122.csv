antidepressants,f579uy6,t1_f56o7jq,1572033300.0,I’ve been on effexor ten months but just upped to 150 a few weeks ago and all I want to do is sleep
WomensHealth,eytpziz,t3_cmu0o5,1567442840.0,"So, I had one for 3.5 years. The size of a golf ball, No joke. Got infected a few times, had antibiotics a few times, had it drained In the office, had a word catheter, had it removed, and even went through a pregnancy with it and it was there. Hasn’t cause me issues for a year or two besides being annoying during sex cause it would get bigger. However 4 days ago laying in bed putting my daughter to sleep it pooped or drained out of no where and it’s completely gone now! 🤷🏻‍♀️"
relationship_advice,ex64unc,t3_crjny5,1566039100.0,"I am still with him because we have a child together that he uses as leverage/threatens me with. Until I can get myself a lawyer to go against him in court I can’t really leave, i also honestly deep down in my soul don’t know what’s right or what’s wrong because whenever I am upset at something that’s happened he says it’s my fault or it’s not that bad or something along those lines so I have no fucking clue if I’m the awful one like he says or what."
survivinginfidelity,erkieol,t1_erke8m9,1560964150.0,Thank you. He’s got me feeling like absolute shit and like I’m over reacting and that I shouldn’t be so upset because “he never actually stuck his dick in someone else however he wishes he had because then his dick would actually get wet”.
relationship_advice,erk9q11,t1_erk5fha,1560958608.0,"Thank you for reassuring me that how I am feeling is okay, (he has made me feel otherwise) but thank you. It’ll only get worse (we have a daughter together too!) I’m sure. It’s pretty ironic because he “neeeever lies and is always honest” 🤣😂🤣"
relationship_advice,erjkz2x,t1_erjgs3r,1560935206.0,It happened 3 months ago... he spent a lot of money then and I was fucking heart broken like heart broken he promised me he would never do it again and how sorry he was... fast forward to now I caught him in lies and he’s made second accounts and side emails from the ones he originally made and he’s back doing this shit again. So he KNEW how I felt about he KNEW it upset me and he KNEW I would be done if he did it again. Yet he’s saying sorry and it won’t happen again but I can’t fucking trust that.
