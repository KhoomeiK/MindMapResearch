raisedbynarcissists,fq8jas7,t3_gh384x,1589167508.0,"My therapist recommended I look up Stephanie Lyn on youtube, “dealing with narcissists”. My first watch brought me some comfort. She says you can’t make sense out of nonsense- it’s a waste of time to try and figure out “why”, and a waste of time to try to get an apology. “can’t get water from a rock”. 

Those videos have helped me deal with realizing (via therapy) that my mom is a narcissist and that I have to manage my expectations of her behavior, namely that she will never apologize.

But yeah- this was one of the biggest things i realized when my therapist told me my mom is a narcissist. There are so, so many awful things my mom has said and done that she just denied ever happened, and i actually dismissed them myself, thinking she must be right. But- they did happen."
