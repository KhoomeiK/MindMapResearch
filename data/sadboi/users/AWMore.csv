Damn Riot you're nasty.

Riot can literally add toxicity as a nice behaviour in the tutorial as it's something acceptable."

leagueoflegends,fpiysqt,t3_gdmys3,1588652005.0,"Well, we always say the same words for everything ""now it's worse than ever"". League has always been cancer, toxic etc. 

Of course it's annoying and need to be changed, but people will always find a way to put their frustration onto something in the game.
It's just a fact, you can punish what to want, it's never gonna change, cuz competitiveness bring a lot of bad behaviour.

I still had to win sometimes in 4v5 five seasons ago, because we had a troll or an afk. 
And still the same now. 

Stop complaining, start building propositions."

Sometimes, anxiety, is about perception, and forcing ourselves in a direction that anxiety is putting us away. 
But I see why you want to take your distance with this subreddit, and posting a message about it, it's good for going forward I life ! You turn here a chapter of your life, the next one will be amazing !"

It's just some LifeProTips, because following the right way without putting yourself in a ""try hard"" situation once in your life, seems so sad to me.

Reddit is something really cool, but it's like a song that has advices in it lyrics, it's just the opinion of one person. You need to see the bigger picture, and the important thing, trust yourself. All the advices in the world are useless if you don't trust yourself and do the work for."
VALORANT,foe5dsi,t3_g6k8n1,1587696365.0,"Am I the only here who think that even tho, becoming a pro is one of the hardest things to achieve. 
That every-fucking-one can do it ? Yes, there is priority in life, yes life is a b*tch. 
The advice ""Stay in school, live your life and don't focus on that video game too much"" is surely an advice that a teenager will listen to ?
Life is about organisation, the rest is just social, basic stuffs.
And the true advice here is, trying to reach a dream which an average person can't do isn't something bad that will put you in danger, it can, but it will not, the thing that will is laziness. Passiveness in your ALL life.

The important thing to keep in mind is that wanting to be a pro is easy to imagine, but doing it is like becoming the boyfriend of the girl who friendzoned you. It's fucking impossible. But still, It will take something more than just being there and believed it, you will need to change the way you're doing and seeing things every minute of your life.
At last, but not least, put the ego away, you're not good, you're still nothing. Work and organizations are everything here."
