quails,fj3j0c9,t3_fbbjis,1582985092.0,"you could keep the quail and pheasants in the same enclosure, but supervise them initially. If any fighting occurs, remove the quail again. Keep a close eye on them if no fighting occurs, as with birds and any small animal things can go from 0 - 100 real quick.  
Normally big birds attack the littler ones; so your quail could potentially get seriously injured by the pheasants. You shouldn't even house common quail with the smaller King quail. 

Problem male quail can be difficult to deal with, too. I currently have a single male living by himself because he keeps bullying one of my ladies near to death. If I didn't love that dang bird so much, culling him would definitely be one of the most viable options, as well as rehoming."
