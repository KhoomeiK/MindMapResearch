Anxiety,fgoihmf,t3_ezjy7u,1580971185.0,"Getting better begins with first keeping yourself occupied with friends work or hobbies. If you are lonely and don't have many good friends, try to get out of the space of depression. If you spend too much time in your room you should get out maybe try gym or sports. Breaking out of the cycle with brute Force is the only thing that helps.

I have been in similar cycles before, and what I realised that my depression stemmed out of smoking too much weed all alone. I quit that and realised it made everything boring and unrewarding. Finding some time to do something may be of help."
StonerThoughts,fecu9x7,t3_eo5wbg,1578984868.0,"All the inputs on how to live a more meaningful life denigrates to present and more emphasis is laid on the sacrifices need to be made for a better future. But there's no point getting there if upon reaching said point you are going to focusing on reaching another future point. There is present, and no future as well. Remember we used to be animals trying to stay alive. That has become so easy today we can't do nothing but run. I AM LOST"

StonerThoughts,f9tcjk5,t3_e6o4dz,1575617351.0,Weed may exacerbate feelings which need time to heal and cause ruptures. You remember things differently and add a filter of current feelings. Also don't think/speak shit into existence.. cause shit will get more real than you may be ready for.

An effort to cut concious with concious will fail for the weak minded. A lot of these stoners also may not have experienced that mode yet, which may overwhelm them. It's only a  maternal side of me which seeks to protect by stating facts."

StonerThoughts,ewl79rm,t1_ewhx5er,1565509277.0,"Hey , I did join a gym three days ago , hope I do it properly.  And I am cutting back too, weed and other substances. You are spot on about distraction, I broke up with my girl after which I began going downhill with the drugs. She used to distract me from something within me - the fear of not realizing my potential to the fullest . That's why I'm breaking up with these drugs, because I want my life to move on. Ya feel me?"
StonerThoughts,ewht6ha,t3_co9114,1565421143.0,"Weed never solves my problems, even though I smoke all day.Weed becomes a problem when you use it to escape or replace something. But I can't quit weed, as it will leave me with so much free time that I'll be lonely again. Is this how you guys feel too?"
depression,evejhll,t3_cjkn9w,1564468633.0,"You don't  want any more advice when you can't mute the voices in your head telling you all kinds of sick shit. I do not tell people who provide this shit advice to fuck off, as they won't get it, and that their words won't help .But a lot of them do actually care about me. So I take it with a sour smile. You get used to it at some point, just like the anxiety and depression becomes a part of you and you become functional and learn how to navigate it. 
Peace to every crease on your brain. Sincerely hope you find solace."
depression,ev9yqyi,t1_ev9bnqy,1564334572.0,Life is for existing. People are too stuck up on enjoying it to the fullest or whatever. But it's important to be objective and realise the meaninglessness of it all. It is ok to be just ok.
depression,ev9y9uh,t3_cd0hjp,1564334242.0,"It is just a state of disillusionment from the gimmick of ""living"", and seeing life as merely  existing. You'll find a lot of people telling you it's ok to not be ok. But what you should contemplate is is it ok to be just ok? What is ok?
Being indifferent to living is not exactly depression. It is just that the commonly accepted way of life in the mainstream world is overrated and may not appeal to everyone. Only one thing truly matters, that is you find someone who understands you, even if that person is yourself. Don't cheer up. Heed the voices in your head for they are the ones who really got you."
