Again, I'm not whining I don't have citizenship. My American passport serves me well. The majority of this video was spent criticizing my parents for failing to connect me well enough with India. I think this is really more their fault than anyone else's.

I don't really care about obtaining citizenship or staying here any longer, either. I would much rather have my American passport! My internal struggle is more torn between India and the USA, and Dubai just acted as a place to divide it in two.

I don't know if I'm completely in agreement with the UAE refusing to give the people raised here citizenship, but the parents who raise their kids here are possibly even more to blame. I genuinely think most of the blame goes on my family here, as they had other options, and if they opted to remain in the UAE they should have done adept preparation for raising kids here (maintaining ties with the homeland, giving them a healthy sense of belonging, etc).

First off...

LOL. 

My mom used to always say... the biggest mistake we make is that we always underestimate ourselves and overestimate others.

I know exactly the video you're talking about. First off, the TV hosts switched to 8 year old level vocabulary when he entered. It was so immediately noticeable it almost felt patronizing.

Literally one of the first words Ben Affleck said was wrong (he literally didn't even know how to say ""impressive - he said 'impresivo' instead of 'impresionante').  

Aside from that, he generally spoke with simple vocabulary and didn't say much that would actually prove he is anything more than B1 or B2 in Spanish. He also made ridiculous errors like saying ""perfecto vocabulario"" instead of ""un vocabulario perfecto"". A year in Mexico, plus the nonzero possibility he has been working on the language in his own time, would indeed put him at that level. I'm not surprised.

He did have a good accent, though, but I generally think most people would agree that an accent is less important than vocabulary and grammar if you can generally be understood.

I'm not trying to disparage Ben Affleck's Spanish, it's actually very good, in fact all things considered it might be better than mine, he might even notice those errors looking back on them (hindsight is always 20/20).

I'm just saying that if something sounds too unbelievable to be true, it probably is.

Also I refuse to believe that you can't immerse yourself. Most of my friends online, whom I've been chatting with a lot due to quarantine don't know more than a few dozen words in English, and we communicate entirely in Spanish... occasionally we have to resort to Google Translate but normally we do it well.

Are you watching movies in French? Reading books in French? Chatting with friends in French? Almost everything you do online can be done in French instead of English. If you haven't tried that, then don't tell me immersion isn't possible!"
