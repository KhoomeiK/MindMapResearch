They also take quite a bit of time to mobilize, making them entirely irrelevant in an active shooter scenario. 

My experience is irrelevant, as is yours. We have facts and evidence, I don’t care how many targets you’ve shot.

And just to be clear, the barrel length thing is more than occasionally true. It’s an immutable law of physics that a longer barrel causes the projectile to leave the barrel at greater speeds and with greater energy. As you said, civilian rifles often have longer barrels than military ones, because the military needs to be able to handle their weapons in close quarters—which is why an AR-15 is not an effective gun for home defense. Combine this with hollow point bullets (which are illegal in war) and it’s pretty obvious how deadly it is.

The caliber isn’t the issue. As you said, 5.56 isn’t *that* much more powerful than 9mm, what makes it so much more deadly is the fact that it’s fired out of a rifle. The longer the barrel, the more energy the bullet is able to deliver to it’s target. Rifles also have significantly better accuracy and effective range, and—crucially—allow you to outgun police."

2. While it’s true that more mass shootings are committed with handguns, when they’re committed with assault-type rifles they’re far more deadly. 
>In the 10 years from 2009 to 2018, there were at least 26 mass shootings (17 percent of those with known weapon data) that involved the use of an assault weapon, resulting in 302 deaths and 653 injuries. In other words, mass shootings that involved an assault weapon accounted for 32 percent of all mass shootings deaths and 82 percent of injuries. **While not used in the majority of mass shootings, when they were, it left *six times* as many people shot than when there was no assault weapon.**

3. Weapons like the AR-15 are designed specifically for killing humans. They’re illegal to use for hunting, with a few exceptions, and impractical to use for daily carry or home defense. Contrasted to hunting rifles, shotguns, and handguns which all have legitimate uses. Plus, if you add a bump stock to an AR-15 it’s essentially fully automatic."

The idea that capitalism is fair is entirely a fantasy, just propaganda. Capitalism is about taking as much as you can; without laws Genghis Khan is the ultimate capitalist.

The way they see it they have successfully manipulated the government and society in general into giving them that money, therefore they earned it."

Sorry, the other person was not operating in good faith, and I made the mistake of thinking you weren’t either. 

I’m not talking about a web of consciousness only humans can tap into either, but I’m also not talking about a conscious universe. I believe all life on earth are essentially cells—part of a larger organism. I don’t think inanimate objects like rocks are involved, nor do I think an entirely separate life (such as aliens) would be involved. 

I believe this organism, call it god or life or whatever, has been working and adapting for billions of years. Not necessarily through some grand consciousness, but through each of our individual consciousnesses. We view consciousness as the defining line between two organisms, conjoined twins are separate people because they have separate consciousnesses. But I think that’s a simplistic understanding, our cells are all individuals connected to one consciousness that they could never comprehend alone. Why could we not be connected to a higher consciousness that we are unable to comprehend?"
