depression,fgnnv03,t3_ezcd1s,1580948971.0,How selfish. I’d understand if you were all alone but I can’t believe you are leaving your wife. Also saw a comment someone said you had a daughter. I hope you don’t traumatize her because children are very fragile and something like this could cause them to become a HSP (highly sensitive person). Which entails to anxiety and depression. Your daughter will become twice as susceptible to illness and cardiac diseases. Congrats.

AskReddit,f6nrgqr,t3_ds15o9,1572998213.0,"Don’t talk about personal topics until you get to know the person a bit better ex. Job, family. Also, never ask for photos unless they offer to show you themselves first, I hate when guys send a photo of themselves and expect me to send one back or if they ask and I don’t know them at all. STAY AWAY from all topics relating to anything sexual, girls don’t wanna talk about that, it’s personal and honestly a dead give away the guy is a POS if he immediately asks for anything sexual including body size like butt and chest. Height is okay to ask but not so much weight as some people are very fragile about that. Pretty much don’t talk to women online because personally, I’ve been on the internet for years and have never met a man online I have ever wanted to meet in person, they all have something off about them I don’t trust. This could get backlash but this is just my opinion and how I see it.

TDLR: Don’t be weird and try to get to know everything about the person right away. Friendships/ relationships take time. 

Also don’t play 20 questions, it’s not an interesting way to get to know someone."
