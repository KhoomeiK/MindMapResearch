I think there are discussions further down on this thread about people disagreeing about when Molly blew up which of course you can talk about whether you agree or disagree with that. my whole point which I think was mentioned at the comment that was above mine was that Molly was entitled to her feelings and entitled to express them. Unfortunately letting her feelings out at the wrong moment how to mess things up and back to my point as I said that had the two girls just talked out their problems at a earlier time we wouldn't even be having this conversation right now.

and then is it really mature to constantly blow off your friend who's been trying to talk with you over and over. We may disagree on that but I don't think that's very mature at all.

I'm just saying what I also saw is Isa blow off talking with her friend several times. Yeah Andrew is a really nice guy so course he can see Isa perspective, and yeah he was happy to help her. 

But because two friends didn't talk through their problems Isa event abruptly ended. So I don't think it's all Molly's fault, Isa has some blame as well."

InsecureHBO,fqahyrg,t1_fqaenbr,1589219382.0,I think you might be thinking about it in a negative way. Molly wanted to protect that relationship that was just starting. because Andrew could have had a negative reaction if Molly went and said hey I know we just started dating but could you do my friend a huge work favor. that could have blown up in Molly's face and the only person who would really have lost anything would have been Molly.

InsecureHBO,fq8teeo,t1_fq8p9tk,1589175000.0,I don't see how she respected the boundary? Didn't her friend ask her to not talk to her boyfriend about the topic? And it sounds like that's what Isa did.
InsecureHBO,fq8s567,t3_gh0w1a,1589173991.0,"I'm really sad, Molly is my favorite character. I really hate that every time Molly tried to talk with Isa, Isa kept blowing her off. 

I think I've been team Molly for most of the show and I think I am a bit done with Isa, unless she decides to talk with her friend. Whether or not you think Mollyor Isa was in the wrong, I saw a lot Isa blowing off chances to talk. 

I though would have waited to talk to Isa after the block party.

Or another option is when Isa talk to Andrew about what she needed she could have talked to Molly at a later time. That would have given them a chance to talk through some of their issues and probably wouldn't have resulted in the big blow up at the block party. 

I'm sure people don't see it this way but that's the way I see it."

 Claire's was in the mall and you know when the mall shuts down it's dark all the stores close their doors and you start counting down your till and other worker starts vacuuming. I was vacuuming the manager was counting the till lights were dimmed, and this person comes to the door and starts yanking on it. It startles me because she's yanking on the door so hard I can hear it over the vacuum cleaner. 

I remember she said I just need some earrings I'm going clubbing tonight. It would only take a few minutes. I just couldn't believe it,every store in the mall was completely closed like I said I don't even know how she was able to walk through the mall maybe she got lucky and a door was left open. But she looks so upset when we told her we were closed. I will never understand people.

Kai needs to go. I think that staying there might not be the best for him. Or if he does he really needs to change like yesterday. We have all had times were we are low on money, but he doesn't show that he is great full. When people are paying for you left and right you need to do a bit more than just saying thanks.

&#x200B;

Vivi needed to have a couple of seats. She first took it upon herself to talk to Kai, which should have been a group discussion. She also came on so strong and I bet that is why Kai got upset. But when she was trying to ""calm"" Hana, I really don't think that was her place to do. I think Hana needed to say what she wanted to say, and Vivi ran in-front of a speeding truck( aka Hana's emotions) and didn't like the outcome.

&#x200B;

Hana.... wow... Hana. Well of course she was in the wrong. But I can understand all of her angry. Seems like there was ALOT they didn't show us in regards to Kai's behavior. I wonder why the editing team left that out. But we got some of those Kyoto scenes and basically harassment front and center.  But if I lived in a share house I would NEVER wash my clothes in the communal washer. I also do sports and I have a uniform that I wash at home but if I was pro-level or using that sport as a source of income I would pay for dry cleaning.

That being said..... how do you not pay attention to your clothes when your in a share house. This comment is for both Hana and Kai. I think If I were Haha I would have reacted the same way. I would have gotten mad at Vivi for trying to ""calm me down"", Boss for making a stupid joke, and I would have lost it when Kai showed no emotion in his apology.

Kai should have immediately offered to pay what he could for her uniform.

What makes this whole situation worse is the stuff about Kai that we didn't see, but obliviously he annoyed each of the girls.

And wow, Hana wanted to start a fight with Kai. That was messed up when she went over and flicked his hat off."

Maybe why you defend boss so much because you connect with him. And that's really sad because luckily a lot of people in this forum realize how inappropriate this person has acted.

 Hopefully when this episode comes out in the West, people will still have the same issue with his behavior. Which is a really good thing because women have dealt with this kind of crap for so long with men who feel entitled too.

I'm so glad that this post basically calls what this girl wants as segregation. It's so ridiculous that people seriously want segregation instead of true diversity.

I studied abroad and University and I remember going to the meeting for students that were going abroad and I I was the only person of color in the meeting. But I didn't let that bother me I was just happy to be able to have that experience to study abroad.

Glad Emika got to have a little bit of self-reflection when she saw the tape of herself. I think despite her tears this is a good opportunity for her to really see how she acts. and this is why I really love the panel because people like Yama chan, can clearly see through people's b*******

I also 2nd the person who advised you to reach for financial independence. Its hard and it might take a while but hopefully that should help you to get away from them. When you do get away if that toxic language continues cut them out of your life. Mute them is what I mean.

I grew up with shitty parents, and I just now in my 30s stopped taking mental/ verbal abuse. I waited till my axcitey/ depression started to take on physical symptoms and that suxs. Getting treatment and managing as best I can now but I hope you can get to a day where your talked to in a nice way. You deserve it !"

terracehouse,fd24m37,t1_fd1wn27,1578141608.0,I wouldn't say he's loaded as he's not a NBA player. But he probably does pretty well for himself. That being said I think you might have missed the point of my original comment. It's the fact that she asked for that kind of dinner really shows what kind of person she is or I guess what kind of person she isn't LOL.
DuggarsSnark,fcwprab,t1_fcwig1z,1578032902.0,That's so horrifying. I really really can't understand how privileged people who live in countries where they can take medicine and can afford too don't.

CountingOn,fc6w3tb,t3_eghlc5,1577491007.0,Wait wait....... she has to ask permission? I know I have seen Josh in photos. What the heck is wrong with this family.
depression,fc2rdes,t1_fc2qszu,1577371788.0,"I  appreciate  your honest response. I want to do it for myself. But I always feel guilty. I know I shouldn't but I do. I should have just hung up. I have hung up before, but I was stupid and thought this time would be different. But it never is. I just want them to know why I went dark on them. But I know they wont listen."
CountingOn,fc2qe2o,t3_efv1mn,1577370928.0,"I think this post at least is fine. They have so many people to ask about how to hold a baby properly, in that family."
gaming,fc1u8rr,t1_fc1rnvx,1577329887.0,I thought they donated most of the toys that they review
depression,fbf80no,t3_ecxfgy,1576803977.0,"Random person on the internet I feel this so much. I think it took my parents like decades to say that they were proud of me. And it took talking to a therapist and having the therapist basically repeat all the accomplishments of my life multiple times to get me to see it. It's a sad fact when your own family can't acknowledge your achievements. It weighs on you.

I'm proud of you for writing this post. 

I don't know if you can but if there's any way that you can start to remove yourself from the lectures, I think that's a step forward.

For me I used to get lectures from my parents if it was verbal, I started just being like well I'm busy so I need to go. And if it was digital like a long paragraph online I started blocking them for a couple days. Just to give myself clarity. Just to not see that notification, it was very calming for me. I hope you can find a way that works for you."
depression,fbf7r7c,t3_eczhm3,1576803775.0,"I really think you have your answer here. And I'm sure that that's been said. I think a lot of people still do not understand depression, mental health, and suicide. it's really ridiculous that they don't understand but that's the sad reality of it.

You sound like an amazing friend, and it's amazing that you are willing to do this for another person. Don't let your family discourage you. They will always be your family and even if they're salty about you coming late to Christmas or coming the next day that's their business. You did a really good thing by informing them early instead of just like texting them on the day of being like Oh I'm not showing up for dinner. Because honestly that's what I would have done if my really good friend had a situation like this. But I'm a cold salty person LOL must be hereditary.

Yeah but don't let your family guilt trip you like that do what you got to do sounds like you have a good head and a good heart. Take care of your friend. And have a Merry Christmas"

Anxiety,fbf3bbd,t1_fbesajw,1576800459.0,Thank you for your response. I will look into magnesium.
Anxiety,fbf39z5,t1_fbekehr,1576800431.0,Thank you so much for your response. Its hard because I worry if people really believe me since its not visible.
Anxiety,fbej4um,t1_fbehbqp,1576786843.0,"I have a lot of stress from issues with my family. I don't live with them but just a message from them stressed me out. I have limited my contact with them but it's been going on for years.
Shaking, tremors, vibrations is how I would describe it. Makes me feel uneasy and I am prevented from sleeping."
DuggarsSnark,fb6z38u,t3_ebk6o4,1576565995.0,Man I had some real design skills in elementary school ..... compared to this.
worldpolitics,fb4stri,t1_fb4nd8w,1576514907.0,This is pretty sad to hear but not surprising. There's probably some really good bills in that pile of 400 that he just didn't care about. Beyond the two big parties it's really sad to see a politician put himself before the people. However that's quite common isn't it....
worldnews,fb4si1p,t3_ebdvpt,1576514748.0,I am reading this on my Huawei phone....
