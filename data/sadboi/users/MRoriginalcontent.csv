Because they took their sorry ass out and did something with themselves... I understand how it is to envy others for what they have, but you know what? When I get older I know that I will walk down the damn street and find me a well paying job, I will find me a beautiful wife and have two beautiful children, because I look forward to the future, this paradise called ""DePrESsIOn"" won't back me down, if I'm pessimistic all the time I won't get anything done, but if I damn well please I will do it, people can do anything, and hey might as well have some fun with it, so maybe you, who is in a place that has the freedom to go out and make themselves known, cry laugh, its normal, but you don't have to be normal, so - again - you know what? My advice is walk the hell out of your house and make yourself proud, in your own special way, go on tinder, buy a videogame, just do something, dont rot in a corner"

FortNiteBR,epqs1si,t3_bvnemu,1559411296.0,"Hi there, as you can tell I drew this skin and I would like to give some insight to it

This is the Leo Skin, supposedly Leo is a young agent in the C.H.A.M.E.L.E.O.N Initiative which basically gives all its agents a t shirt and glasses which can make them turn invisible

Now, to the juicy part of this skin, Leo is a Reactive Skin Despite what I wrote on my paper, he can change a little bit to green, for example he gets green dots on him as you get more kills

And Right Now that's it, I haven't really thought anything out for Leo as he is the first Concept I've ever made"

With Apologies,

Green Dreads - outlast 200 opponents
Blue Dreads - outlast 400 opponents

Green Shirt - earn 2,000 xp
Blue Shirt - earn 4,000 xp"
