The only people who physically assaulted anyone was you and your pals. You shoved Tom by the throat, you guys held him down, and one of your friends punched him in the jaw. 

>like let him smoke pot and stuff so hed be way better off than with us.

So you shoved him by the throat, and then told all your friends, and because you shoved him, you all decided to kick him out, and began to force him to leave, trying to forcefully dial his mom while you guys held him.  You didn't even know if he could go home and if his mom was chill with psychedelics. Only after all this did he start acting really erratically and understandably so. He just got shoved in the throat by his friend, who then ran away and came back with the whole posse to force him to call his mom, while they restrained him. And what did you do after you failed to call his mom? You guys continued to try to make him leave, proving you cared more about getting rid of him than anything else. Finally, your friend punched a dude having a bad trip, and then, had him held down by police."

He was unarmed, he was one guy who was simply suffering. You were an entire group of young adult men, he was no threat to you, he was just scared, and you guys decided to punch him and have him held down by police."
Psychonaut,findv5z,t3_f8rspe,1582561530.0,"You and your friends fucked up Tom, big time. First you let your friend trip knowing he was suicidal. Next, dude was having a classic bad trip, and instead of reassuring him, showing some love, and trying to calm him down, you guys isolated him further and further in his own head. You tried to keep him cool with the threat of being kicked out into the streets ALONE, while TRIPPING?! And then when you went outside, you literally attacked him and ran away because he was ""being spooky,"" and gathered all of your friends to berate him and tell him to leave. You were the one who freaked out on him and attacked him, he was desperate and in pain. And ok, I get that some of you were tripping and in your own heads, BUT WHERE TF WAS YOUR SOBER TRIP SITTER? And then, after you attack Tom for being ""spooky"", and after all of his friends reject him and tell him to leave, he starts acting REALLY erratic. No shit this was going to happen. You guys are really stupid for letting it get to this in the first place. But it gets worse. Dude is clearly panicking, unable to distinguish reality from the trip, and so, in return for having anxiety and having a bad trip, which is already an extremely painful existential experience, in return for freaking out over what has been happening, Ramon's dumbass punches him in the face. Then you have him held down by police to ""help him."" Not an ambulance. The fucking police. Wow. And your ""friends?"" I wouldn't go over to Mal's house to take a shit. Who tf rejects a close friend who has anxiety and is depressed, just because he was acting erratic during a bad trip, which all of you played a big hand in exacerbating. This experience is going to scar Tom forever, ESPECIALLY the part where you guys decided you hate him because he had a bad trip. Not to mention, he doesn't even remember how you guys ganged up on him, all he knows is shame and self blame. He apologized and still, your ""friends"" have abandoned him. You guys are really stupid for this one. Fix this, as soon as possible."
