ladycyclists,fnr88t7,t3_g3cbgi,1587181742.0,"i agree w/ /u/NeglectedMonkey. there is a ton of variation in bikes, but humans are also great at adapting to the myriad geometries that frame designers have churned out in the last few decades. also at our shop, we are being bought out of a lot of our common size bikes (medium, 50-56cm frames). and we only deal in 3 brands consistently. and we are fighting with other shops in the state or region to get the remaining bikes in stock with the manufacturers, and it's down to single digit supply per size. so reading between the lines, you are both visiting shops whose stock are inherently different, and also being served what is realistically available now, even if normally they would have a better option in stock or able to be ordered for you. that's bullshit they don't let you size/fit in person--i get why, but still, a bad way to go about biking on their end.

but i will say, the trek, specialized, and giant (liv is the women's sub-brand of giant) all have a large portion of their business in road-oriented bikes. so it's possible that if you are leading with a suggestion (""i'm looking for something like the specialized crossroads"") all those bikes they recommended are going to be similar variations on the same concept. also, some road and hybrid bikes comes stock with skinny tires, which will sink and wobble over uneven ground like gravel :)

some affordability tips: disc brakes hike up the price point, so just know that non-disc (rim) brakes are still fine (self-maintenance is easier with them anyways) and can save you about $200+ on the list price right off the bat.

stay on the course of a hybrid. whether new or second-hand, look for flat or swept-back (cruiser-y) handlebars, as those are easier on your posture. look for wider tires--you can change these out easily but it helps to start with what you want if you can find it. a skinny tire that doesn't do dirt well is going to be around 700x25, so 700x32 is a good size to look for. or two hybrid recommendations that people are loving in our region (seattle): the Kona Coco and the Kona Dew Plus (like /u/Juliathefarmer said!) The Liv Alight looks mad solid as well, and more affordable than the Kona ones.

sorry to overwhelm. bottom line: a bike is a bike--yes, some are better, but for what you're hoping to do with it, there are going to be many many bikes that will serve you well."

and for what it's worth, molly's abrasive and condescending delivery of her critical thoughts are definitely a tougher brand of love, but i don't perceive molly as having tried to actually plot to sabotage or interfere with issa's up-and-up moments. also, molly seems to continue to have a chip on her shoulder about being likable, which her new job seems to be testing a lot, so her boundaries with issa are probably a little more blurred/invasive than those of a more secure person. i agree that tiffany is way sloppier in showing support/'protecting', in the way she withholds info from not only issa but the others throughout the previous seasons.

bikecommuting,fmxgom4,t1_fmx5uo4,1586464647.0,"it's pretty strong, and was adopted relatively early compared to many other us cities. lots of people consider it which is already the first step to priming people to adopt its lifestyle advantages. lots of people are drawn into how easy it is to buy an e-bike by rad power here in town. plus, because of our steep and unavoidably hilly terrain, many commuters start considering electric soon after using this mode. our public transport also does not effectively connect certain groups of neighborhoods to each other without requiring a transfer downtown, and yet pretty much any public transit vehicle has long been equipped for multiple bikes, and transit popo don't harass bikers the way they do back east. 

one thing that stands out to me is how many more people here will bike their small children to school on e-cargo bikes, before going to work themselves. kids certainly seem to push e-bikes more into the mainstream. i only wish that bike shares could be more sustainably successful here, so we could have rentable e-cargo bikes for anyone who wants to move small furniture, garden, shop, have beach bonfires, etc--incorporate e-bikes into more and more services where the bulk and cost barrier of a rental car are just inconvenient.

our city is fairly full of highways, significant spans of which are elevated, so the road network is not intuitive for anyone learning to bike in the city--electric or ""analog"" (as i saw one person describe them haha)--but there is a general welcoming attitude towards accommodating e-bikes permanently in future infrastructure design practices so that people don't have to keep learning this whole separate trail-based biking mental map in order to commute. seattle's urban paved trail network has been a robust feature of the city, but keeping e-bikes on trails and seeing them as ""bikes"" and not ""vehicles"" certainly introduces a danger to those greenway users (joggers/bikers/families), and so we do have a loose but positive support for better complete streets design.

also, seattle's bike theft is prevalent but not aggressive or particularly well-thought-out, so parking an e-bike or using it in certain areas of the city poses no overbearing additional liability. so yes, saving on parking--or just being able to park in more places--is pretty real."

also at least, i hope more people get to know the roads better now that they have to feel it much more as they go over it and share it with cars and the increasingly jay walking pedestrians. people out here reeaaally are overdue for developing situational awareness in public."

but nyc will always have a version of whatever organization, business model, likeminded association, odd shop for production or materials, professor who has lived or worked elsewhere, etc etc to make your definition of employability achievable. nyc has a network that expands beyond its city's limits, because of its reputation and its history. meanwhile, a great program that graduates me into a relatively small pond (like seattle and its incestuous architecture industry) is arguably still employable, just not with as many options.

istp,flt17e0,t3_fqv25z,1585456240.0,"some friends and i have discussed type changes, and we noted that myers-briggs questions tend to ask you to think about what you would ""rather"" do/be/like, and is a test based on your own evaluation of who you think you are. ergo, over time and over maturing, people who develop different views of who they would ""rather"" do/be/like will have those tendencies reflected in this kind of assessment. 

ie, on the scale of agreement, ""i have a hard time expressing emotions"" or something can prompt you to filter your answer through what you think is a fair combination of your past actions and your future intentions. over time, this may skew more and more towards ""disagree,"" if you are trying to open up as you mature

as for your own change's trends, this may or may not intersect with the ""sociopathic tendencies."" but it's something to remember that all these exercises in typing are just us trying to see ourselves from as many angles as we want to."

police are in the wrong for being this insistent on harassing the man. police don't care about cyclist safety in major liberal cities, let alone in michigan. imagine if you were a cop and you were dispatched as ""back-up"" to a cyclist biking ""without lights""--would you even entertain that scenario as worthy of thwarting this guy from commuting?"
Seattle,flmk7sv,t3_fkcdpq,1585286127.0,"Alki Bike & Board remains open under the ""bicycle repair"" identifier for essential business. Especially in light of the closure of the higher West Seattle Bridge to all traffic, those who seek help with bicycle maintenance as controlled-contact transportation to get in/out of West Seattle can come to us. In-store occupancy is severely limited but hours are not: they are still as posted on Google Business & website (alkibikeandboard.com). 

My 2¢, which is not any official stance of the business, is that I don't want to promote people using bikes as a vehicle (literally or figuratively) to go outside *more* often for pure recreation. I have more opinions, like for instance if you want a bike, please don't rent a bike just because you get the impulse to do so, but really we want to help you all feel sane and you're still welcome to call us to see what we can offer.

AskReddit,flm1xtx,t1_flkn1lm,1585272698.0,"i share your thoughts in that last sentence. combined with very public directives for the building industry to expedite everything mostly just to make sure that certain stakeholders get their money's worth before they can't anymore, this period of time feels like salting the earth we till. i'm not optimistic the industry will fare well at all, even from a design perspective--who knows how many projects will be scrapped or just given up on in favor of a rush to design the next new post-pandemic ""innovative solution"" instead of focusing on real needs that maybe some projects that are now on-hold would have addressed"

guyswefucked,fks4uih,t3_fk8dyb,1584482312.0,"marc maron's podcast! he doesn't hit the topic every episode, but it's fairly often, and when he does, he hits it hard. if you're in the mood for commiseration or a less flowery ""recovery is beautiful"" schtick, then marc's ramblings can be a good reassurance that even the bad parts are worth it.

also tigerbelly, similar thing--bobby lee will sometimes touch on it, and when he does, it's fairly realist. also he relapse recently after the death of his father and he talks a bit about that on a more recent episode (mid-feb ep, i think).

and both have some amazing guests (incl. krystyna pretty recently, and both c & k a couple years ago). yes they're men and they say some bizarre things, but they talk about recovery a fair amount and are also funny (to me!)"

Good News by Mac Miller :'("
ladycyclists,fj31zf7,t3_fawhx5,1582963300.0,"so if you live in a sizable city/region, my thinking is there may be a bike co-op (community bike shop, volunteer bike shop, non-profit bike shop as alternative names for em) where you could certainly hit a lower price range, and not have the sellers at the shops be in a position of foisting inventory onto people. not everywhere will have these, and they're not going to have a perfectly comprehensive selection, but it's better than craigslist.

that being said, i really like craigslist. i've gotten quite a few bikes off craigslist in the past (stopped bc i actually got a 2018 liv avail years ago and have been riding that ever since hehe) and while none of them were in new condition, they were all sturdy and great for the kinds of rides you want to do. plus, for higher mileage, you could go low $$ on the bike, but then swap for a better saddle, pedals, bar tape, etc.

but yeah the seller you had been talking to was overpricing :)"
ladycyclists,fj2w9hx,t1_fj0s5zt,1582956239.0,"yikes yeah it's an imperfect piece of equipment, and it's not helped when people also do the ""ooh why aren't you wearing your helmet??!"" guilting lol"
ladycyclists,fj2vniw,t1_fj042a0,1582955594.0,"yeah, i think the helmet is not a perfect piece of technology so i would agree that your concern has some truth. like, for people who have odd skulls, helmets will always wobble a bit too, and i guess at a certain point it becomes this token of liability in the event of worst-case scenarios :/"
ladycyclists,fj2veab,t1_fj0o1j5,1582955328.0,"actually, this and all the other comments mentioning wraps/buffs bring up a good point so thanks @ all! most of the other women i've cycled with have em already, so i should...try heavily to make my shop stock them"
ladycyclists,fj2v49d,t1_fj0qr3t,1582955040.0,"i have also long agreed w/ your planning perspective--i do feel that ideally, anyone from a day tourist to a long-range commuter should be able to bike and not have to have a helmet, just to feel like they belong on the street. people like to roll the windows of their cars down to yell at me for not wearing a helmet and it's like....thanks 4 concern but that's the opposite of how i think cyclists should be regarded.

but yeah it's true that in a shop environment the assumption is that it's due diligence to suggest a helmet. but re:kids with parents and newer/more recreational riders, the helmet symbolizes a lot to them for peace of mind, and especially with parents, i live in acute fear of sounding not-caring enough towards the children lol!"
ladycyclists,fj2udju,t1_fizvo58,1582954307.0,"wait, my specialized helmet has the ponytail thing! also kavi makes 'womens' helmets with similar/the same. you prob already know this, since you've prob already looked into this stuff, but as far as i know, it's not uncommon that the dial in the back of the head that is typical with bike helmets will sometimes say 'HAIRSPORT' for women-marketed gear, so that the overall adjustment band at the back sits lower towards the neck and therefore leaves more of a gap for ponytails/low buns"

asianamerican,fgjj6gz,t3_eyslkw,1580845147.0,"When you share your experience, even if yours was 'typical' or 'normal' by widespread standards, maybe talk about how expectation or community thinking played any roles in how you see yourself as part of the culture. I think that's something that is being discussed a lot now, but which even in the early 2010s when i went to college I felt I ""shouldn't"" talk about. 

I'm addicted to the anecdotal experience sharing that happens across many of the asian cultures thanks to the evolution of communication in this technological age, and also as the experiences there overlap with those of immigration. You may have a interesting perspective just by being a different age, since things have changed so quickly in the last 15 years in the US aka the entire conscious lifespan of many your students, that you can just talk about for the sake of providing background and nothing more. 

Also I personally liked when my professors had talked about their pasts without fear of losing the respect of us students--talking about their professional failures, of how they didn't do well in school, of how they just made mistakes in general as they grew into where they are. I think back on some of that now as I'm doing my own career shit and have a whole new scale of people to compete with/measure myself by, just bc it helps me feel more forgiving towards myself for feeling uncertain or deviating from whatever paths I knew."
