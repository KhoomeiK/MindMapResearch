“Constantly ask “what’s the next immediate action?” Shifting your focus to a doable task will create a real increase in positive energy, direction, and motivation. “Long term” means “more actions until it’s done.” You can’t really “do” a project at all, only an action relating to it.

1) Collect things that command our attention.  
2) Process what they mean and what to do about them.  
3) Organize the results.  
4) Review as options for what we choose to  
5) Do

Celebrate any progress, don’t wait to get perfect. Often the only way to make a hard decision (such as “where do I even start?”) is to come back to the purpose. Increase your energy by closing smaller loops, changing context, or redirecting focus.”

Also, from How to Maximize Misery by CGP Grey. Helpful goals should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Actionable,  for which you are Responsible, that are Time-bounded. Unhelpful goals are ones that are VAPID: Vague, Amorphous, Pie in the sky, Irrelevant, and Delayed."

EMDR ( Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing ) can also help with PTSD, since it's (to put it plainly) guided exposure therapy.
