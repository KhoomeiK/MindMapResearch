I liked your idea of Apollo trying to force her into marriage and Hades saving her from that though!

InsecureHBO,fq9qwja,t1_fq9mcgf,1589205164.0,"Well this season we have clowning her relationship, not coming to thanksgiving, and missing her work dinner.

We also see Issa say in all seasons 2 and 3 whatever is wrong at Molly's job or in her relationship is NBD  and she is doing the most. Usually the time she does spend with Molly is to talk abour herself or to redirect the conversation to herself or to ask Molly to do something for her or to trick molly into doing something for her.

See going to the club to see Daniel not cheer up Molly, See Broken Pussy, See making light of the Dro situation and not checking on how Molly is doing, see not taking the tension at her new job seriously and pushing Molly to go to coachella. See not being concerned that Molly is underpaid and telling her stay at her old firm. See making Molly drive hours to distract Andrew while Issa searches his apartment for Nathan infomation. See Issa being mad Molly (who planned her 30th birthday party) didnt invite Nathan after he ghosted her for weeks. When tf has Issa planned shit for Molly? That was actually for Molly and not an alternate plan? 

Honestly if people have been building up resentment against Molly, I think I've been building resentment against Issa.

Edit: also see turning their lunch date into a 3way with Condola and assuming Molly would be cool even tho Molly really wanted to talk one on one."
InsecureHBO,fq9i2vq,t1_fq9dbez,1589198893.0,"I think they overstepped the business relationship with the Lawrence information. Issa was messaging her about anything and everything (paragraphs). And I honestly feel like while she shouldnt have ghosted there wasn't more for her to do because she literally signed on to guide/advise Issa and help her get sponsors. Which she did. Condola did not sign on to plan the event with Issa from start to finish. It just ended up going like that because they really clicked. Which honestly is Issa pushing for more from someone she barely knows and isnt paying.

Edit: Ghosting is bad. Yes. 

But people are acting like Condola tried to destroy the Market Street Block Party but she didn't and did enough helping for someone Issa isn't really giving anything in return except eroded boundaries.

Edit 2: Didnt she also provide interns and check on the vendors she approved? How is she a saboteur?"
InsecureHBO,fq91rz7,t1_fq8icvw,1589182538.0,Molly might be petty and overdramatic but she's definitely not insecure. She's hurt and feeling betrayed. Not thinking.

InsecureHBO,fq91kto,t1_fq8fbx2,1589182341.0,She didnt come to Molly's celebration dinner for her case and didnt attend her thanksgiving that she regularly comes too.

In the routine of normal life, it's easy to say everything is fine, I'm fine, my hair is fine, my body is fine, the boyfriend I hate is fine, the shitting city I live in fine, my crap job is fine. But like if it's not? Then its not and you should change that. 

Either way no matter what happens now or going forward, in 5 years you'll still be five years older and that's time and opportunity that you can never get back for better or worse. I would hate for things to go back to being miserable if that's what it was for them pre-COVID.

Especially since they have such strong actors (except maybe Sam and Culhane). I hope this COVID-19 downtime gives them time to brainstorm and really mix things up. Dominque's reality show has potential. Alexis and Colby's sham marriage has more potential (I was disappointed more wasn't done with this honestly). I know Adam is reformed now but he's a delight to watch. Liam's mom! Definitely one to watch. I feel like Anders helping the family do some dastardly shit is always good content they can lean into as well. It's definitely hard to balance so many characters but if Degrassi and One Tree Hill and TVD could manage, I think Dynasty can too.

Another thing that I don't love is that sometimes they'll start an interesting storyline and then just abandon it as soon as it gets good. It can feel like opportunities get watered down to be palatable, but the show is CAMP and they should really just go all the way."

I mean not sure if the original dynasty was focused on the entire cast of characters but I definitely see people talk about the original Alexis the most. Whereas I feel like Dynasty CW is Blake and Fallon's show. Like if Fallon were gone tomorrow I'd stop watching. Episodes without Alexis are fine, episodes with Alexis are also fine. 

I agree they could do more with her character. But I highly doubt anyone on this show will be outshining Fallon anytime soon. And tbh I wouldn't want to see a rivalry between Fallon and Alexis anymore. If anything I'm open to the family going against Cristal's cartel family or The Colby's again.

Also, there have been a few lengthy diaries with minimal spending that I enjoyed despite common gripes about it not being a \*money diary\*

Thanks for sharing about your demographic and background. It's amazing that your family valued education and you were able to have extraordinary academic opportunities. While I agree that student loans and loans, in general, can be leveraged to give you opportunities there can still be bad investments. Taking out 6 figures to go to a neighboring state school to find yourself without a plan is a slippery slope. This is obviously not the same as using a loan to go to an IVY or T10 school and leveraging an elite network.

Lastly, I agree about not being able to separate work from home life. I'm an intern for a business in my state and since SIP, I've been working remotely on my personal laptop as opposed to a company-issued laptop (they didn't I would need one when I was hired) and I find it hard to disconnect as I've been getting everything from class, work, to personal channels coming at me at the same time.

analytics,fpnsou6,t3_gei75v,1588771750.0,"So I would say you're very qualified for junior and probably even mid level positions. Other people have given good advice about how to keep your skills sharp so I will go a different route. 

1) To get interviews during this time LEAN INTO YOUR NETWORK. Any colleagues or people you have worked with you personally on a project, professors, classmates from your programs. Ask them for leads and recommendations. 

People are way more willing to take a chance on even a fool someone they know recommends rather than an expert nobody really knows much about. 

This also puts hiring people at ease when it comes to your percieved lack of confidence. 

2) The lack of confidence due to your speech impediment is sugar coated discrimination. But since you asked about getting hired not pursuing a law suit, here's my advice. 

Created canned STAR responses and canned personal stories. There are a bazillion canned questions on the internet. Most interviewers arent as revolutionary as they'd like to believe.

Practice telling your different stories (STAR or CAR method) in different ways (thing 5 main themes/situations told up to 4 different ways) Take your time, slow down to enunciate. Yes it may sound rehearsed. Who cares? Interviews are BS. Look at yourself in the mirror. Practice ad nauseam. Do a mock interview with friends of colleagues and use the stories. Get their feedback. Practice some more. Video yourself saying your stories. 

Bonus points if you bring up overcoming your speech impediment in your masters program or in a professional setting. 

Boom. Get the job."

InsecureHBO,fpndprf,t1_fpf9izb,1588759296.0,I'm so happy for her. Healing at work. Healing at home. Healing in love. These past few episodes have been a Molly glow up reel.
InsecureHBO,fpndmg8,t1_fpgpykf,1588759200.0,YES CONDENSED MILK IS WEALTHY IN LOS ANGELES!!!!
InsecureHBO,fpndj5p,t1_fpflrzt,1588759104.0,I personally still find it hilarious that Constellation and her friends are fucking rich and Lawrence is about to be laid off from that startup where no one takes his ideas seriously. To think he was worried about ISSA saying he was broke and unemployed for years. Okay Jose. Also everyone asking him about the aldo shirt was so funny. Congratulations isn't worried bout Lawrence at all.
InsecureHBO,fpnd6am,t1_fpg0s7y,1588758732.0,I cackled!!!!! It's so onbrand. Like throw back to episode 1. Broken Pussyyyy.
InsecureHBO,fpncqta,t1_fpgaozp,1588758291.0,"Yessssssssss she doesnt have it together at all. Also Molly is a literally a lawyer. She was right to ask about the contract. Her tone was aggressive but wtf? How you pay for flyers without a written agreement? Especially since she's supposedly working with Condolences to make it a legitimate affair. 

Also their relationship has been off for a while now (4 months), she doesnt take Molly's relationship seriously, but she wants a favor? I'm sorry if this was Tiffany or Kelly saying no, no one would bat an eyelash. And they would've said no on the first call. 

And she literally told her brother that she's salty Condola got the glowed up Lawrence. People seem to forget that she didnt stop loving Lawrence. Relationships are complicated."
InsecureHBO,fpncflw,t1_fpg5psc,1588757963.0,"Issa doing the same old Issa shit honestly. And while Molly was shady for assuming Issa was going back to Lawrence, Issa lowkey misses that man! I'm literally not understanding where Molly has been wrong these last few episodes. 

Her tone is aggressive tho. And that parking spot was not hers!"
InsecureHBO,fpncafh,t1_fpg2634,1588757817.0,"THANK YOU!!!!!! Molly has really had a glow up this season and all her relationships are improving except the one with Issa (sigh)

And frankly I agree that Issa has always lowkey blown Molly off and views her the same way her men do. *Excessive and doing the most*. And yes they joke on each other all the time but I think Molly is exhausted from always helping Issa (rightfully so).

And Issa wants to be taken seriously. But how can you take someone who's fucking a TSA officer with 3 kids for contraband weed? Or someone who has a job as apartment manager but can't pay the water bill? Who was living with the man she cheated on her ex boyfriend with and tryna be just friends? Like.... 

IMHO, they don't need to be close friends. Men hang out all the time and never talk about deep shit, not all female friends need to go below surface level fun. Molly is fun and likeable, she can get other hobbies and make new friends more aligned with her lifestyle."
InsecureHBO,fpnbsy7,t1_fpgd6df,1588757318.0,I hope tf not. That'd be going backwards. I feel like Molly and Andrew will work out. I think once Issa gets the block party together and elevates her career and finds her footing they may reconnect. But this needing to both be losing to understand each other thing is not the business. They're both exhausting.
