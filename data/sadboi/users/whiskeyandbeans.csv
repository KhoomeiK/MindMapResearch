serialkillers,fltv610,t1_fltqevu,1585488192.0,Is it loosely based? I’d be interested in reading it if it isn’t exactly like the show!
serialkillers,fltlb1w,t3_fqxkew,1585477807.0,Is the Mindhunters book related to the show?
AskReddit,f9uy6t0,t1_f9uy430,1575659812.0,It’s possible... I’ve talked to someone about it!

AskReddit,f9ubgee,t3_e6v94o,1575647784.0,"I’ve had four nose/sinus surgeries. Just had my fourth a few weeks ago, and I’m happy with my decision. My fourth surgery has so far presented the best results breathing wise. I had some complications from my septum being straightened in my second surgery so that led to some problems and my turbinates did grow back- but now with allergy shots and nose sprays that delay the time it takes for polyps to grow I won’t have to worry about my turbinates reinflating for awhile. If you have any questions I’ve been through it all."

sugarfreemua,f8pege7,t3_e1gntb,1574700225.0,"I would love to learn how to contour- every time I do it I think it looks too dark and noticeable... any advice? Video tutorials? Peachy blush would be good- the blush I used today was a new palette that was very magenta and REALLY dark so I pretty much covered it back up with foundation. Thank you for the previous advice, I do feel much better with the brown eyeliner and I’m going to get a lash lift (doing it at home pray for me)."
sugarfreemua,f8gx18j,t3_e07j35,1574566366.0,I bought some new makeup today to try out this advice- I’ll try to post back with an update!

More blush could be good too."

sugarfreemua,f8e3yda,t1_f8czn02,1574518017.0,Like a cool brown? I’m bad with eyeshadow- I always feel like it’s translucent or too dark.
sugarfreemua,f8e3wi0,t1_f8cocho,1574517975.0,Thank you very much. That makes me feel more confident.
sugarfreemua,f8e3sly,t1_f8cpl0j,1574517891.0,Hey that’s a big compliment- thank you!
sugarfreemua,f8e3kk4,t1_f8cmp3v,1574517730.0,What color/brand of eyeliner pencils would you recommend? I can look for Colorpop eyebrow pencils for sure.
sugarfreemua,f8e3ff1,t1_f8dgqsu,1574517628.0,Spring- got it. I’ll Pinterest that! I’ve always thought my skin tone was really finicky and weird. Changing my part sounds very scary but I can try it out.
sugarfreemua,f8e3a8z,t1_f8cgbnk,1574517525.0,I think there is a consensus about the eyelashes- so I will definitely be trying that! What color eyeshadow for the lower lash line?
sugarfreemua,f8e37ic,t1_f8chy4v,1574517462.0,Thank you so much. I can definitely start turning up the point of my wings. I’ve never worn false lashes- it’s a little intimidating because I’m not good at applying small stuff like that but I’m willing to try it out.
sugarfreemua,f8e30zn,t1_f8cp0fl,1574517324.0,Hey that’s a good point. Makes me a little sad because symmetry is beauty :(
sugarfreemua,f8e2xzm,t1_f8chw70,1574517263.0,I’m having a hard time picturing the lower lash line technique... do you happen to have a picture what this would look like? Lash lift is a great idea- do you think the do-it-at-home kit is an option?
sugarfreemua,f8e2rw5,t1_f8ce8ph,1574517130.0,I never even thought about using brown eyeliner! Would I still do wings or just a line? I don’t really know how to do anything else.
sugarfreemua,f8ckfjs,t3_e07j35,1574462177.0,"Thank you for the kind comments. I promise I’m not compliment fishing, I’ve just not been able to take selfies for months because I can’t stand how I look and I want that to change. False lashes are a good idea- possibly even getting a lash lift? As for the eyeshadow under the waterline... how do you do that without the powder getting in your eye?? Also I stopped messing with my eyebrows after I went a couple years over drawing them to the point where I looked like a cartoon character. I can’t seem to find a happy medium."
Allergies,f85hbt4,t1_f7uzgwj,1574275255.0,It’s actually Allertech shampoo. It has helped immensely.
Allergies,f7ufmp7,t3_dxmr17,1574014316.0,"Oops, it’s actually the Allertech brand."
Allergies,f7uebp1,t1_f7ue0nl,1574014024.0,We have the spray too. I find the shampoo 5x more effective! My eyes used to swell up and I would get hives- I cried for weeks because I thought I had to give her up. Thank god for that shampoo!! Highly recommend.

ptsd,f74ya3w,t3_dub9ut,1573409695.0,"One of my biggest paranoias is that I am being ""over dramatic"" or ""making something out to be worse than it actually is"". My parents would cause me to experience horrible things (mom got drunk and hid my inhaler when I was having an asthma attack, told me I was being dramatic when I was having an asthma attack that led me to arriving at the ER with blue lips, seeing my mom bleeding from her nose while my dad cried over her saying ""please don't die"" until the ambulance came....). After these events and more the next day would be like it never happened. If I mentioned it they would wave me off and say that it wasn't a big deal. When I start thinking people don't believe me I start spiraling. I was diagnosed with PTSD and I am too scared to tell people. I feel like it is not valid because I wasn't sexually or physically abused. I shouldn't have to feel like I ""earned"" a diagnosis but here I am. I'm having a really hard time right now."

ARFID,ey1o91a,t3_cuwuwc,1566705417.0,"Mine is an interesting theory. Around 2 years old I began to heavily resist eating non-safe foods. My parents would make me stay at the table until I finished and would even turn the lights off after an hour or so. I would just put my head down and sleep until I was allowed to go to my room. My dad later confided in me that he had ARFID his entire life- and his mother (my grandmother) told him “I hope one day one of your kids does this to you so you can see how horrible it is”. Just like me he would cry himself to sleep from embarrassment and frustration on a regular basis.  

So I like to think I was cursed.

Probably also had something to do with being allergic to milk when I was a baby, (had to have soy milk only but grew out of it?) as well as a severe peanut allergy and asthma. I could also credit it to my mom starving herself to avoid the pain from Crohn’s disease."
relationship_advice,ertrx2o,t1_ersryzh,1561251393.0,Thank you I appreciate that. I hope you and your boyfriend find a happy medium soon. My boyfriend has been getting more frustrated as well. I can see the struggle on both sides.

I have tried finding therapists but the disorder is too new to find specialists and the ones I have seen so far don’t know it. It puts so much strain on my life and my relationship. I hate it more than anything.
relationship_advice,errsdrz,t1_erqkvh3,1561181465.0,I have ARFID. It makes life incredibly difficult for my partner and I. Came down to the comments to say that he likely has this. I’m glad there is at least some awareness of it nowadays.
