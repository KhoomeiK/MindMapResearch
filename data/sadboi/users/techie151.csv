Here are some links to Youtube videos from him that, in my opinion, demonstrate this quite well.

I love this man's music.  He knows exactly what he's doing, and how to get the absolute most from his instruments/effects/etc.  He has made some of the most moving music I know.

Synthesizers are instruments.  I'm sure people had the same opinions of the instruments of other cultures around the world, and even today many people hold these views.  As time goes on, such instruments become incorporated into other cultures, and then the view that such an instrument is not a musical instrument is *even more* undeniably false.  Synths are *EVERYWHERE*.  I would venture to guess that she has heard them, loved them, but had absolutely no idea that what she heard was a synthesizer.

Let me and everyone else here know what becomes of this!  Hopefully she can change her mind, but some don't want to show they were wrong, or are just too damn stubborn.  If she still maintains her view, move on, and let it go, knowing that you were - and still are - right!  :P

sounddesign,eyubwgj,t3_cyukk9,1567458088.0,"From my understanding, offset is used to identify where the cycle of a waveform begins.  For example, if you had a unison effect on a synthesizer, one could change the offset (if the synth has the setting), and it would modify where the wave starts.  This could give you a very distinct, punchy detune, or a modest start.  For a phaser or flanger, offset might similarly define where the effect's wave begins, making it start ""mid-cycle,"" in a matter of speaking.  Offset might also be thought of as ""phase"" in some cases.

I don't know if I have seen it in delay, personally, but I imagine it has to do with timing.  I have also see ""offset"" used in vocoders.  It has to do with the cutoff of the bandpass filters, but I am still wrappung my head around vocoding's technical aspects.

This is my understanding of it, anyway."

It's a great synth, but still suffers from having the same menu-diving editing system.  They have come down in price quite a lot, too.  Just to throw another option out there, should it be relevant.

It sounds to me like the unit is kind of busted, unfortunately, so taking it back is a good call.  As for the factory reset:

As for the crispness of the supersaw pad... I am going to say the it is a little high pass to take out the bottom a bit, and make it less heavy.  Perhaps some EQ'ing was done as well.
