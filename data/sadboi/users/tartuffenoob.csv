I'm not quite sure what went wrong in the interview, I was asked very simple questions and was able to answer them truthfully while relating my experience back to the job description. It was a phone interview with two interviewers and one of them just gave off awkward/disinterested vibes throughout most of it. I just kind of knew when I hung up that it would not result in a follow up interview or offer. 

When I mentioned the portfolio I was asking if I should bring in a paper portfolio, my personal computer, or neither. I mainly asked for future reference as I am not sure what is standard interview procedure in this field. As for the job types I've applied for, I'd say about 70% have been internships because my qualifications are minimal and seem to best fit internships. Also, I've been told to wait until mid-March to apply for jobs due to the hiring dates overlapping with my semester. I am looking to relocate so I've been heavily focusing on non local jobs. I also live in a state with low economic outlook so jobs in this field are growing but slowly. Thank you for your input on your experiences with local vs non local applications! It's really helped me put things into a new perspective."
