My cat used to be indoor/outdoor for the first 5 years if her life, she hunted and would often be out for days at a time. I moved to a new house on a busier road and decided I wanted her to be indoor only. She adjusted within the first week and it’s now been 1.5 years since she’s been indoor only. She hasn’t tried to escape a single time and I think she’s actually happier than she was before because it’s a less stressful environment.

AmItheAsshole,fjd4fc8,t1_fjbthl5,1583245401.0,"This needs to be higher up. What you said fits the situation exactly. It’s nobody’s fault that the father was an alcoholic and he will live with that addiction for the rest of his life. It’s going to be a constant battle for him till the day he dies and I know because my mom is a recovering alcoholic. She has slipped up many times and it takes extreme caution to protect herself from making a mistake again. Forcing an alcoholic to be around alcohol is very risky. The Dad is not an AH for not going. I would not expect my mom to come to an event that I hosted were alcohol was going to be everywhere, nor would I be disappointed that she didn’t come. Actually I would prefer if she didn’t come for her own safety. 

The mom got caught in an impossible situation where she would disappoint someone whether she went to the wedding or not. The negative side effects of not going probably outweigh the side effects had she gone, but I don’t think she is an AH for the decision she made."

I moved out of my parents house recently and took my cat with me and now she is strictly indoors, is happier than she’s ever been, and always uses the litter box.

Also, using a lint roller right before you leave the house or even in the car will help get the hair off. If that’s not enough you can also use dryer sheets when you dry your clothes or spray your clothes with static guard."

Pets,eonfwuj,t3_bshrqq,1558711524.0,"Every cat is different, but in my own experience I’ve had many cats living together at the same time and they didn’t all get along. At one point we had 5 cats because my sister temporarily moved in with her 2 cats. Out of the 5, only 1 of them was friends with all the other cats. The other 4 disliked at least 1 of the other cats living in the house. 

 It is likely your cat will be able to get along with another cat in the future, but that doesn’t mean it will like just any other cat. Some factors to consider are playfulness, attention needs, gender, are they territorial, and is the cat spayed/neutered. Try to find a cat that matches your cats personality traits. If your cat loves to plays, do not adopt a cat who lounges around most of the time. If your cat needs lots of attention, having another cat can help soothe their needs. 

Again this is all just from my experience as a cat owner."

I was living with my parents and they had 2 other cats, one of which she didn’t get along with. She was always begging to go outside because I don’t think she was happy living with my parents cat. Eventually, I moved to a new apartment with my cat and her behavior changed drastically. She is a lot more vocal now, but she uses the litter box and never hisses at me anymore. She’s so much happier. The issue could be something related to your cats environment. After my cats change in behavior, I realized that a cats environment has a HUGE impact on their behavior and personality."

He swallowed one of the baby bunnies whole right in front of me after I told him to back off. He usually listens but he didn’t that time. After that he never did anything like it again.
