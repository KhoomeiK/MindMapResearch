depression,ffohey7,t3_eu7fur,1580077656.0,I know we’ve never met but well done for not going through with it. Few people get that second chance and it takes great strength to do what you did. Much love
NetflixBestOf,ffif39h,t3_etmqv7,1579972351.0,"Sex education: great characters and storyline, awesome script, and raises (and answers) important questions. Lots of sex scenes/nudity so if that’s not your thing/makes you uncomfortable then you can skip them or it might not be for you"
depression,ffiekf2,t3_etqbpl,1579971994.0,"I’m really really sorry about the situation you’re in, it’s the worst feeling when someone you trust betrays you. People like those you’re describing are the worst people and don’t deserve someone amazing like you. Is there anyone else you feel you can talk to to feel safe/secure again? If you don’t feel like you can trust people yet then don’t worry about it, you’ll find someone/your group."
asexuality,ffc4ja9,t3_eseh4y,1579791346.0,"I’ve just started it and while it’s interesting to see how other people feel about sex and relationships, I do feel uncomfortable when the sex scenes come on, so I skip ahead. I find it so weird how people just like have sex all the time or want to."
