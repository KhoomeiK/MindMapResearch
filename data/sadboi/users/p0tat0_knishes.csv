BPD,euqqvv6,t1_euqpjmb,1563983848.0,"Me too! I am 31 but I feel more like a 21 year old. I'm really short and look young so people usually think I'm closer to that age, too. Like you I went through my entire 20s struggling with mental illness. I got on mood stabilizers at age 30 and I feel like a different person (in a good way.) But now I feel behind."
BPD,euojibl,t3_cgyvul,1563942559.0,"Oh god yeah, there are so many hobbies I want to try but I feel like I have to be the best or not do it at all."
BPD,eri8y1y,t1_eri8op3,1560892039.0,I totally get it.
BPD,eri81tk,t3_c21xiz,1560891471.0,"I hope this isn't a stupid question, but does the average person feel content working a full-time job? This is something I wonder about, since it can feel so exasperating for people with BPD. Do most people hate it, but can handle their emotions better? I am a grad student and have a good part-time job, but I can get so depressed some days that I want to quit everything."
BPD,eri7mh3,t3_c232o7,1560891218.0,"Yeah, I'll feel like I'm on the right track and things are going pretty well, and then the next day I'm thinking I need to abandon everything, move away and do something totally different with my life."
BPD,eqoorhg,t1_eqne6gs,1560190952.0,"I try to tell myself this too, but like you said it doesn't make the feeling completely go away."
BPD,eqoolq7,t1_eqmvl0f,1560190902.0,I just started the DBT workbook so I'm hoping that it will help!
BPD,eqlgeit,t3_bymzis,1560143922.0,"I take a combo of Wellbutrin and Lamictal (mood stabilizer) and it makes SUCH a big difference, at least with the lows and dissociation. It makes me feel like I can see things more clearly. I'm better at connecting with other people now too, before I was so guarded and quiet because I had trouble feeling present. I've been on Wellbutrin for about 9 months and Lamictal for 5 or so."
BPD,eqlf9lq,t3_byoiw5,1560143305.0,That's awesome! Yoga helps me so much more than anything else. I think focusing on making our bodies feel good and strong can be a welcome distraction from how bad our mind feels most of the time.
BPD,eq3a4au,t3_bwyvia,1559752167.0,"I do this constantly too. The worst part for me is that when I've moved on from something, sometimes I'll look back and cringe, thinking I looked stupid/was bad at whatever I was doing!"
