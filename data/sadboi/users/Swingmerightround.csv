>""If you were in hospice and had already been given a few weeks to live, and then you also were found to have COVID, that would be counted as a COVID death. It means technically even if you died of a clear alternate cause, but you had COVID at the same time, it's still listed as a COVID death. So, everyone who's listed as a COVID death doesn't mean that that was the cause of the death, but they had COVID at the time of the death."" Dr. Ezike outlined.

That's from one of Pritzker's press conferences, from the IL State Dept of Health, you unbelievably dense bag of meat. Continue being proudly ignorant and refusing to listen to the facts. You are cancer."

>If someone dies with coronavirus, even if the death wasn't caused by coronavirus, it's considered death by coronavirus.....?? Yes?? If someone contracts the virus and dies from complications involving the virus.......can you please elaborate? If someone contracts AIDS and then dies due to pneumonia, AIDS is the cause.

No, I'm making complete sense, you just aren't understanding what I'm saying.

For instance, if someone is in hospice, and during that time they contract corona, and die(as they were going to), they call that a corona death, even though Corona didn't have anything to do with their death. The VP has said this, Pritzker's press conference verified this. Even if the death is *completely unrelated* to corona, it's still a *corona death* if they tested positive at time of death... 

Now do you understand? Do you need a picture with colors? Maybe if I put this in the format of a child's cartoon? I wouldn't insult my intelligence and call me a brick wall when every reply you have sent is void of *any* facts or substantive rebuttal."

Jesus christ, where are you getting your numbers from? They are counting deaths even if the cause of death was clearly from another cause, if they had corona at the time of death it's a ""corona death"".

As antibody testing ramps up, as was just shown in a CA county, the infection rate is much much higher than thought, and the mortality rate is much lower than thought. I don't know how you aren't grasping this? Many more are sick than thought, and surviving. 

And it's easy to say our wallets are more important because you know, food and shelter cost money. My medical care costs money. Feeding my child and protecting him costs money. Again, this isn't hard to understand- a ruined economy will kill multitudes more than covid ever would."

rockford,fo424ba,t1_fo41pi7,1587496892.0,">The whole flattening the curve thing doesn’t work if we just re open everything. We still need to keep people inside. I know these are scary times but we still need to hold for a little bit longer.

That's why Insaid start reopening. I don't expect everything to go back to normal right away, but we need to start incrementally moving towards that. 

And again, the elderly and those most at risk should continue to stay at home, but for most we don't need to keep everyone inside. 

What do you envision as a time frame?"
rockford,fo3za5n,t1_fo3ywwj,1587495496.0,"The mortality rate for this is maybe slightly above that of flu. We flattened the curve, which was the entire point of shutting down. We accomplished the goal. How do you justify continuing it?"
rockford,fo3wr0n,t1_fo1j14l,1587494249.0,"Have you seen the unemployment numbers? Notice the TRILLIONS dumped by the federal govt to stave off a great recession? 

Do you know how many people would *die* from a great depression? Many, many, many more people than would die from Covid 19.

This whole shut down is idiotic and completely half assed anyway. Everyone still deemed ""essential"" are coming into contact with dozens, if not hundreds of coworkers throughout the week. They go to the stores still for food, and come into contact with others, including workers who come into contact with hundreds of people a day.

Start reopening the economy. Push the elderly and immunocompromised to stay home. Communities are willing to help these people while they stay in. We can't stay shut down forever, it's not feasible at all and would destroy the economy. If you're ok with collapsing the economy then good fucking luck when the riots and violence start, and don't end.

Edit: Downvotes and not a rebuttal in sight, how shocking 🙄 

**I implore you downvoting monkeys to check out the antibody testing done in California which shows infection rate may be up to *85 times higher* than thought, bringing the mortality rate closer to *0.2 percent*.**"
