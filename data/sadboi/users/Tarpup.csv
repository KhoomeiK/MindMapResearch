Not allowing their behavior to diminish or compromise the integrity of my composure. I know they are miserable, and I know they are simply trying to project that misery onto other people. By maintaining my composure, and truly not allowing their petty behavior to get to me, they get the message that I have no issues with them being miserable, but I am simply a stronger person than they are and immune to their childish behaviors.

At this point if you die from covid 19, fuck it, you were spared. The way things were going before the epidemic turned into a pandemic, and the way 'they' (being the US/local state government) has handled things in the midst of the epidemic while it was developing into a pandemic, you are likely better off dead. Who knows what this shit show will turn into."
Coronavirus,fq78wxq,t1_fq6phb8,1589143300.0,"You are aware my first comment compared the US as a whole as a developing (2nd world country), not a underdeveloped (3rd world country). But when you threw 3rd world into the mix, I got down on the idea. And there are places in the US that are completely 3rd world, or underdeveloped. 

But we do not aim to progress because we are America, not Japan.... Lack of progress is the reason why we are dealing with what we are dealing with today. You can google all you want about our country and other countires. But do yourself a favor, and head to a deep pocket of poverty within the US. And realize you've been indoctrined to look at America in the ways you do in comparison to other countries. 

You are right, we aren't Haiti, but there are starving children in America, and we are allegedly too good for that. But it happens, why? We are definitely more wasteful than any other country, and we throw food away that could feed people. But, they don't want someone getting sick and suing them, so the food goes to the trash. Because America is not a country. It is a business.

So hey, whatddya know, there are plenty US citizens living without the full list of basic ammenities. Another example, The Flint Water Crisis. You fail to realize that America gets away with being able to offer only some of those basic ammenities, and still get classify our country as developed, even though we are developing still..

 You look at the United States as a whole, but we do not operate as such. Each state is almost it's own country. And each state seperately can be catagorized as developed, developing, or underdeveloped. To make an observation, is simply that. So with that in mind, you can absolutely say that some states, are developing and underdeveloped. And that the way of life is that of a developing country, sometimes underdeveloped. 

It doesn't matter how you want to word it, or spin things. Like ""aren't we always developing tech and meds lulz"". This is the reality. The poor in the US do not have a voice. So how can you hear their issues, and hear them with the appropriate perspective, when you aren't looking to see the truth. And only wish to cater to only your opinions and perspectives gathered on google. 

 Our government makes sure all we do is bury our heads in the sand and insist that our country is better than it truly is. Again, America is a business not a country. Not realizing there is more going on that you think you know because you can use google is unhelpful to your argument. 

Figures are always misrepresented. Some figures cannot be made due to the fact that it isn't being appropriately recorded. Much like the start of covid in the US. We had more cases than we assumed, all thanks to the lack of testing. Plenty of people died from covid 19 before we really caught on, but on their death certificates it says they died from other causes. Look at China and the way they falsified thier records of Covid 19. 

You take care my friend. I feel like the only thing you have are opinions and google. You lack perspective. That's fine and okay. But I am checking out of this petty argument, because if you wish to be a brick wall that is fine with me. That's true ignorance."

You end up realizing it is absolutely fitting to put it like that. It's disrespecful to sugar coat the reality there is plenty of the US that is underdeveloped/developing, versus developed.

 To deny the realistic comparison, undermines the struggles of people living in these parts of the US, and undermines the struggle of humanity in general. Making this observation should be sobering and bring us all together to strive to better the world as a whole, since the world as a whole is basically a giant 3rd world country. 

I wouldn't be worried about the issue you presented, as much as the issue that we currently face. Which is the opposite of what you said. People in the US think anywhere in the US is developed. They think that even the parts of the US that are underdeveloped and developing are developed, because the US claims to be developed.. Go to any shanty town and you'll realize people live in the US like people live in underdeveloped and developing nations. It's a sobering statement at the current, yet massively ignored reality that there are parts of the US, that are comparable to underdeveloped or developing nations. 

A developing country is a developing country. To be a developing country and call yourself a developed country is much more harmful than a stigma. Because then you get your own citizens completely unaware of the severity of these issues within the US, who in turn walk around and say stuff like how it is disrespectful of me to put it like that. Even though the same struggles do exist in the US. It's like you are telling me I am right, but I need to find a new way to market the information because it hurts your feelings.

Sorry to tell you, but no one in an underdeveloped nation gives a flying toodle about what anyone of us says on the internet. They just don't. They would look at this, and call us both idiots. Then go back to not trying to die for the day.."

I mean shit, the Flint Water Crisis was a real thing. And their corrupt government made things only worse by telling people the water was fine. Meanwhile over 100,000 residents were being exposed to ridiculous amounts of lead via the water supply. 

Don't get me wrong. This kind of shit happens everywhere all over the world. But America really does a great job out-dumbassing the rest of the world with shit like this.

All thanks to the bill of rights giving people a false sense of entitlement. Like my hero George Carlin once said, we don't have rights, just privileges. The false sense of ""I have rights"" leads to these kinds of idiodic exchanges. Leads to all sorts of discrimination. Just leads down a dark and dirty road. The collective is much more important than the singular unit. And most our units (us citizens) are self serving. Therefore incapable of acting on the behalf of the collective. 

This is why people would suggest to resort to shaming. I understand the anger towards people who do not take things seriously, because it can and will affect others. But shaming will never work. You must educate people, and do it in a way that makes them feel proud to make the decision to wear a mask. Because they want to. Not because they were told to. 

Americans hate being told what to do. Because again. Our ""rights""."

There is clearly a wrong way to be a dad, and I feel in no way you will partake in such actions. Soley because you understand what it means to be misubderstood.

 But in the end, as long as you try your best, you will be the best dad. You already are. I do not feel like a good father, which is why some people have told me, makes me a good father. I know you are already on the path to lead your child to greatness. 

And I am proud to know you will be nothing but accepting and nonjudgemental towards your child as the years progess. Mainly because of your own relationship with your mental illness. Same goes for me.

My boy is 4, almost 5. And even though me and his mother aren't together. A big part of that was due to the fact she was just not good for me, which meant that together would do more harm to him than good. She's a great mother, but for me and my mental illness, the relationship was harmful to me. Which would be harmful for him. He saved my life. And I owed it to him. So I have finally found a mental position to be in to be the best I can for my boy. 

And my ex is grateful as well. She remarried and now gave my son a silbling. Which I never felt comfortable doing because I never planned on having a child intentionally. He was an ""accident""  but we made every intention on keeping him.

And I know in some respects, it is reflected upon any parent who struggles but learned how to best navigate those struggles to reflect unto how you raise your child.

This post, along with a text from my ex of my boy saying ""good morning daddy good morning daddy gooood morning daddy!"" made my day.

That text made my day. But this post solidified it. 

I am so happy for you. And I am so happy for this child. Because you will be a major part of their life.

Congrats congrats congrats!

schizophrenia,fmusvvk,t1_fmuqysg,1586398150.0,"OP has responded. And said the obvious. I am making assumptions based off of little information. Which I told them I agreed, before I even realized it was OP responding. Because little information was given, I spoke from the potential situation which was given, where at that point, OP should consider his actions and how it has lead to this point. OP has given up on therapy. Which means at this point. Practicing some self awareness and figuring out a way to repair things, so they don't end up homeless is the only thing they can do. Apart from disbillity and finding a place to live.

OP's mother, if she truly didn't care would have kicked OP out regardless of what is happening in the world. She does care. She does love OP. OP needs to stay in that home because of that fact. Their mom clealry doesn't emotionally abuse them, they are better off in that home. So this is how OP should approach things. 

The bottom line is I did not say anything that would cause someone to take their own life. OP has a lot of shit going on. And OP did not tell me that I was being rude or condescending. Just said the truth, which was that I was making assumptions given little information.

 Which I again agreed with. And expressed that I hope they can read what I wrote in the manner I meant it. Versus how you read my comment, and making your own assumptions about how it makes OP feel, even though you have no clue how OP feels about my comment.

This is again, you making it about you and how my comment made you feel.  Saying things like OP is suicidal and maybe they don't want to live is planting more harmful seeds than my comment. 

Telling OP that if they want to stay and not be kicked out, this is the best approach to at least tie their mental state over during the duration of self quarantining, and possibly making it so their mom doesn't follow through. Is less harmful than you toting their mental state like a war axe.

Anything can make anyone actually take action on those fantasies. I am trying to choose to focus on solutions. Whereas all you wish to focus on is the problems.

Fact of the matter is OP's mom does care, and is likely willing to work with OP. Given OP is willing to work on getting to a better postion mentally. She clearly supports OP. And that kind of support is truly valuable to the efforts of bettering oneself."

This is not about you. Or how you feel. This is about OP, not knowing what to do. You are helping less, and doing more damage than you think I am. By being more rude, more condescending, and by rubbing OP's issues in my face while providing absolutely no hopeful or helpful advice."
schizophrenia,fmucn6u,t1_fmtmmco,1586388788.0,Wow... Please reread what you wrote. And see how that is more harmful than my suggestion to be strong and overcome his obstacles.
schizophrenia,fmpxu04,t1_fmnxcpe,1586289292.0,"You are right. Guess what I was trying to say is. OP's actions have consequences. And if they value the support they had, then they need to try to do their part to make things better.

Edit: Oh shit you are OP.  I hope you see what I am trying to say overall. Versus the literal things I say. 

I do not have the best at brain to language communications. 

My heart breaks for you and your mother. And I just want both of you to be happy. I know your mom is doing her best. And you should at least consider how your actions hurt her too. In ways that might help you fix the relationship.

I know me and my father had these same issues. He even locked me up in a hospital for 3 weeks. Of course, I was the one who littered my arm with ciggy burns.

But I hope you can see through my bullshit, to see what I truly was trying to communicate."
schizophrenia,fmpxmkk,t1_fmnz1bs,1586289188.0,"As someone who was in the same position as OP years ago, and today find myself standing tall, proud, and as cured as I can ever get, because there is no cure for this shit. I am alive, because I decided to take things by the balls and yank as hard as I could.

Now, I am on my own two feet, and realized there is no sugar coating these things. When you take my quotes out of context sure it looks harsh and condescending. But then again, that means you read what I wrote, but took no time to understand what I was saying. 

I had to figure it out myself, like I said we all had to. That means OP is not alone, and not the only person who has been in this position. These people who figured it out, and built a solid foundation to rebuild themselves on. And now leading as most of a successful life they can despite everything.

We are all fragile. But we are all responsible for our own feelings and our own actions. We should never coddle eachother, or ourselves, because then we will always remain fragile. And always remain on a shakey foundation.

Mental illness does not have any biases on who it affects. Rich, poor, male, female. Life doesn't know what it means to coddle. Life only knows how to throw obstacle after obstacle at us. And it is up to us to... *Figure it out* 

This is what I mean by OP having to figure it out. THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO! This is what the real world looks like. The real world doesn't care if you are schizophrenic, autistic, or any of that.

To try to paint things in ways that are more damaging than helpful, is most harmful and will lead to further issues. 

I am only asking OP to look at his actions, and consider how they have generated the consequences laid before him. And to realize he is the only person who can change his situation.. 

I mean. Who is responsible here? Is it mom for not being emotionally capable to handle OP's self harm or suicidal tendancies? Or in my situation. Is it my parents fault for locking me away in a mental hospital because they saw my arm littered with cigarette burns I gave myself?

In the words of Ben Solo, OP knows what to do. They just don't know if they have the stregnth to do it. Meaning, getting the right kind of help once and for all. 

I didn't tell OP to suck it up, and quit being a little bitch, because THAT is harsh, condescending, inconsiderate, and entirely irresponsible. I didn't tell OP that their mom is a cunt who should never kick out her baby because she NEEDS to be there for him. Because that would also be irresponsible and does no good for OP. 

The only person you can truly rely on is yourself. If OP values what support their mom can offer, then they need to do their part as best they can to repair the situation. It is not on OP's mom. It is on OP.

Sometimes words of inspiration do not come in the form of coddles. They come from a place of understanding. And right now. You only choose to understand things from OP's positon.

 I was only saying, consider what mom is dealing with too and how OP's actions have an equal and opposite reaction. The whole picture is made up from all the small parts.

TLDR: I will GTFO, but god my heart breaks for OP and his family. Especially if they never actually get the appropriate help they need to officially get themselves back on their feet appropriately."

When you do something like slit your own wrist because you are in pain, you are doing her a great amount of pain. 

Her choice is the best choice she has to make. Otherwise she is just enabling you by supporting you just so you can do these things to yourself, and to her.

Perhaps she feels that you do not understand the opportunities she a has provided you to have, because she supports you.

 Maybe she feels like you are only able to do the things you do because she enables you to by supporting you. 

So.. you will now have to figure it out. Like most people do. You should use these next few months trying your best to better yourself. And hopefully earn back your mother's trust. In hopes that she changes her mind, given you continuously show an effort to be better."

cosplayers,fmn2njn,t1_fmmu8tj,1586216920.0,"You are absolutely right.... to me it is about the overall discussion of ideas and opinions..

My comment was for the sole purpose to say, try to look at things through OP's perspective. You already have a leg up on those who shit bash OP because he feels this way. Because you have an nonjudgemental perspective on what it means.

In the end. People have their opinions. But do not see the whole picture. And when presented with the whole picture. They acknowlwdge it, but still have an opinion on what it means to them. This goes both ways. Your amazing perspective WITH AND ALONGSIDE OP's perspective. Gives you the most perspective obtainable.  That is where I come from.

 Mainly because.

OP and I do NOT agree 100%. But we get along, and can totally shoot the shit about these things. Because we do not treat eachother as wrong. But treat eachother as people with ideas and opinions. And even if we disagree about how we feel about things. We can agree on the fact that we are both people and both have real reasons to feel the way we do.. but ultimately. We respect one another.

This to me is how things should be.... racism is obviously a wrong opinion overall. But the way OP feels about cosplay etc. Doesn't make him wrong. What is wrong is that you meet his opinions with yours and you treat your opinions as more right than his. 

NOT SAYING YOU DO. Just saying that is how majority of Americans are.

This is also why I stated it lies within the grey area. As long as you respect the grey, you will always be able to respect and shoot the shit about different ideas together in a productive manner. 

I would hate to have friends who all agree with me 100% leaves no room for growth or intellectual improvement.

This is OP's opinion. And to bash it without trying and taking the time to really understand it. Does no justice to anyone. Again. Not saying you are. It seems like you are on my perspective on OP's argument. 

But I am defending OP's ability to have these opinions. Because it is not Black and White, but grey. 

I love you, and hope you and your family are doing well during these wild times. Just as I love OP. And wish the same."

cosplayers,fmmok3m,t3_fw4jmh,1586209098.0,"I personally know OP's opinion about things.

This is the most generally respectful post they can make. Because if they truly wanted, they would really rip into their opinions about things.

I understand where they come from, and when it comes down to it. They aren't wrong. Cosplay is cosplay. A star wars themed porn is porn. It is not cosplay. The intent for the nature of the act is what is to be focused on.

However. Those who argue against are only saying, these girls want to cosplay. But they are also doubling and banking on what they normally do for money. In which case it lies more within cosplay than it does porn. 

It's one of them grey areas. Which makes it very hard to navigate via a debate. A discussion on the other hand. Much easier to be had about the exploitation of guys who have nerdy tendancies, and would like to have them expressed in a sexual way. Versus blaming the girls themselves for sexualizing the characters they portray. 

But it's good to hear from you again OP.

EDIT: I had a similar argument with OP months ago about the same thing. But it just took having a real conversation to understand thier point of view. To realize I agreed in many respects. And it is more philosophically driven than anything else."

As a history nerd, it is absolutely something I would be jealous of, only because I would love to be able to do ""what I am doing"" with them. Touch, hold, and ultimatelty be grateful to be able to tangibly touch history.

But from a personal perspective. These things weighed heavy on my pops. And is likely the reason why I treat them with no enmity. But the personal history makes it hard for me to feel that it is worth jelousy. 

But I have caught shit from people because they feel my respect for history and these item's involvment in history is disrespectful to my pops and all vets.

To which I say. GTFO sheeple. 

It is one thing to be born into a country which tries it's best to indoctrine their civilians to bow and defend their every move. And another to act on your indoctinations to judge and condemn people who view history as world histoty unbaised in it's entirety, versus your country's history which you trust 100% to  be the only history.

Japan and Germany clearly downplay a lot. And the US justifies. Which I think is worse than downplaying. To downplay is to acknowledge you did wrong. Justifying is making excuses. 

But to be someone who goes against that grain, to appreciate history, unbiased, for the truth and the whole truth. I am glad I have these items. 

Maybe when this all is over, I would love to have a history party and get people together to appreciate these items. My pop's, and this officer's stuff. And any other relics, other people have. 

Instead of a BYOB party it would be a BYOR party. Bring Your Own Relics. I'll supply the booze happily if I can see and learn more about other people's relics."
