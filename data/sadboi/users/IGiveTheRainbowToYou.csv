Kids are expensive, time consuming, loud, emotionally and physically draining. Being a woman the majority of the the child rearing would fall on me as well as the huge physical and emotional damage pregnancy causes.

I'm an introvert with a short fuse. I don't lose my temper - ever, but that's because I have purposefully went out of my way to ensure my life is free of stressors (as much as is possible in capitalist society). With children I'd be surrounded by all of the things that stress me out, unable to escape. I know I'd snap and say/do things I'd regret. 

People always tell me I'd make a great mom and honestly it annoys me because I'd be a shit mom. I'm immature, terrible with money, drink too much and can be recklessly impulsive.

I was given a name that has roots to part of my heritage. 

It's a very masculine name (I'm a woman) despite being a feminine name in the language it's from. 

As an example think something like ""Scoat"".

People didn't know how to pronounce it so I wound up getting called an even more masculine name eg ""Scott"" majority of the time. 

There is also a more common English spelling of the name so after people caught on to the pronounciatuon it would get misspelled as ""skate"" constantly.

I started going by ""Amy"" about 10 years ago and am soon going to have it legally changed.

Honestly it's made my life so much easier and as an introvert being able to avoid all the damn awkwardness my legal name caused has been great.

Neither of my parents are happy with this and honestly I don't care as they have no concept of what it's like as their names are very simple think Danielle and Aaron, while my brother is called Trevor.

I am adamantly childfree. Since I was a kid I've made it clear children are a big fat no for me. I don't like kids in general, I don't hold peoples babies and I don't baby sit.

My best friend wants three kids and I'm so excited to be a honorary aunt. We've talked about everything under the sun to do with her future kids even though I can't empathize with her maternalism I can empathize with her as my best friend. 

However I know it can be difficult when people constantly invalidate your childfree stance and tell you that you'll change your mind/wish for you to have an oopsie baby. Has this been happening in your friend group? As she could have done this as a retaliation to constantly feeling under attack from those around her.

Regardless of her motives your friend pulled a major dick move. She's made being childfree such a huge and toxic part of her personality. This whole thing was just needlessly cruel, especially to the women suffering from infertility.

I worry I'll never get my ""happily ever after"" because I'm such a niche personality type that the likelihood of ever meeting the one is so incredibly low.

I have always been upfront about being CF. This means at 26 I've never been in a serious relationship as I don't give more than one date a go with people who want kids, and I immediately end things with anyone who initially lied about being childfree only to reveal their desire for me to suffer the burden of their seed when they think I've become emotionally attached.
