history,fpu5twf,t3_gf26m9,1588905309.0,"The U-boats ravaged Atlantic shipping throughout the war but especially 1941 and 1942. Thousands of ships went down. At the same time(sorta) the RAF and Luftwaffe were dueling daily for control of the air. They were attacking cities, demoralizing the population. The air war was a close thing. If the Luftwaffe had persisted just a little longer, they might have overwhelmed the Brit Air defense system and left Britain exposed to endless bombing. And possible invasion. The Suez Canal was vital to Britains trade routes to the mideast and India and was being threatened by Italy and Germany in North Africa. That was a concern until 1943. So all these overlapping perilous realities must have been crushing to the spirit."

I would find the best therapist i could. The problem with the PD's is that people frequently don't see that they have one. I had no idea. I just figured i was a dumb shit who made mistakes. ""To err is human"", right?  It would have been life-changing if I had gotten into therapy as a teen but I'm not sure I would have stuck with it.  I have found that learning more about this stuff is sort of calming. Also, I've had periods of my life that were not so bad, for whatever reasons. I did ok in the Air Force. Structured environment, everyone has a job and a rank and behavioral expectations, and a certain camaraderie develops. Plus you're busy all the time. I did have a couple ""incidents"" because of my impulsive mouth but nothing serious. I built houses for a while. I loved swinging a hammer, working up a good sweat, AND accomplishing something while exhausting myself so i just fall asleep at night. The problem was, of course, sooner or later, you have to be dealing with people! Peace."
BPD,felsku1,t3_epq57g,1579229895.0,lol I am insane behind the wheel. I don't mean that I drive crazy or reckless. I don't. But I am constantly growling to myself about other drivers. It drives me nuts to be stuck behind a slowpoke (who is going the speed limit!). I don't get stupid and lay on the horn or anything but I have to have a little chat with myself and calm down. My stress level is always elevated and I'm always happy to get back home.
BPD,feip8p9,t3_ep3wod,1579143821.0,"Thanks for the comments. After my second divorce (bet that sounds funny), I met a woman that saved my life.  She was perfect, but, of course not perfect enough for me, so I tried to drive her away. Tried and tried. Me real a-hole. No dice. So we've been best friends for 35 years but never have lived together because I don't trust myself in that situation. She clued me on BPD. She continues to display superhuman patience with me.

I drank so much back in the day that i messed up my stomach so I cannot drink. I use a lot of pot.

I realized that I like to work with my hands so if I'm making, breaking, fixing, unfixing etc, the time flies.
