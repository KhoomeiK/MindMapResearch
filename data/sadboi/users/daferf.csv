Menopause,fqhngq5,t1_fqhijoo,1589380579.0,Sweating is the body's way of getting rid of excess heat. Wicking away the sweat is wicking away the heat and it will cool you. If you can wick it away quickly/immediately (like with air blowing on you) you can prevent ending up in a puddle altogether because sweat will never accumulate.

mentalhacks,f36odqp,t3_dfw9o1,1570715263.0,"A counselor or therapist is going to be the best way for you to get to the root of the cause and make lasting change. Speak to your parents or other trusted adult who can help you find someone to talk to. In the meantime, think about what you're lying about, to whom, the situation... see if you can find any patterns to when you lie OR when you don't lie. That may give you an idea of when you can expect yourself to lie, and you can make a conscious effort beforehand to prevent it. If you tend to just blurt out lies in conversation without even thinking about it, then work on the 'speaking without thinking' part, and don't worry about the lying part so much. Just try to stop yourself before you speak. Easier said than done, I know. It takes practice. But it gives your brain a chance to ""approve"" what you're about to say before you say it. If it was a lie you can fix it before you speak. Depending on the situation maybe you decide not to say anything after all, and that's ok too."

I just want to say that you young ones are so fortunate to have the insight and understanding that you do about  yourselves at such a young age. I've struggled without it. A lot. And I continue to struggle. 

So the nugget of wisdom from this ancient is, don't waste that knowledge and insight you have, and keep learning as you go. Use it to help yourself have the most excellent life for YOU. Whatever that looks like.  And if you see someone who seems to be struggling to find their way, reach out to them. It's possible nobody else in their life is paying attention.

I expect great things from you all. Make it so. ;D"
