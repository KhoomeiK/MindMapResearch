Maybe have you be able to play as a version of either the Doctor and the Master, and have quests with different morally ambiguous issues that the player needs to come up with a way to solve (with there being multiple ways to do one quest). Then depending on how the player solved that quest, have it affect the player’s reputation and in what ways they can progress the same story. So if the Doctor completes a quest in a dark/manipulative way, have other characters (namely your companion) react to that. Alternatively, if you’re the Master and you solve a quest in a way that isn’t dark, have characters react to that (such as the Doctor reacting to it positively). You could even have both stories as the Doctor and the Master interlock at different points, thus giving the game a certain amount of replayability."

Especially given that Green Day are signed to a big corporate record label and make a shit tonne of money off of rampant capitalism, so they’re hardly going to want serious change, are they?

Compare them to bands like Fugazi, Bikini Kill, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, etc, who aren’t signed to big corporate record labels and who aren’t needlessly commercial. Hell, Fugazi are so against merchandise that you can’t get an official Fugazi t-shirt. Furthermore, their lyrics aren’t statements like “war is bad” with a load of edgy fluff around it, they make actual criticisms that go deeper than broad statements that most people would agree with (Fugazi’s criticism of gentrification in ‘Instrument’, Bikini Kill’s criticism of white cis men blaming victims for rape in ‘White Boy’, Black Flag’s ‘’Police Story’ you can probably guess about, Dead Kennedys’ critique of milquetoast liberals who go on gap years to places the West has fucked up and how they fetishise the poverty there in ‘Holiday in Cambodia’). In short, they don’t just talk the talk, but they actually walk the walk.

To be clear, I’m not saying Green Day are an inherently bad band or any worse than those bands I’ve listened based on their music, nor am I saying you shouldn’t listed to or enjoy their music.

gallifrey,ffiif2m,t1_ffifluc,1579974614.0,"My sincerest of apologies for not maintaining the *exact* turn of phrase I used in my original comment. As my sentiment was obviously not clear enough, let me spell it out: if the nazis - I’m including the ‘White Identitarians’ and the ‘Race Realists’ who shy away from the word nazi - get the chance, they will kill millions.

As we’re being nit picky, you’ll find that my comment about right wing extremism being “back in style” was a generalisation talking about the world at large, you’ll notice the US was simply used as an example in that sentence, not as the subject.

But, seeing as you don’t seem to recall a time where extreme far right beliefs and policies were in style in the US, I’ll list off a couple for you, because I’m helpful like that:
- Slavery
- Jim Crow laws
- Segregation 
- Having homosexuals and transsexuals being branded as mentally ill 
- How large and influential the KKK (who still exist) were, such as their large scale rallies and lynchings, and the fact they had many members who were politicians.

Or is that not far right enough for you?

As for the Philippines and Brazil, you don’t seem to disagree with my observation from what you’ve written.

As for Trump, do I really need to make another list of things he’s said or done that are very overtly bigoted, and why the fact that someone who says and does such things can get into such a high office is worrying in and of itself? Because I can, if that’s what you’d really like me to do. 

As for your points on US immigration policy and the missing of climate change targets, yes, previous presidents have been quite bad as well, hence why neither of my comments said anything along the lines of “golly gosh, I wish we could have Obama back, he was a real angel.” 

And on your final comment, the original nazis didn’t start their genocide until several years after they’d got into office, but I suppose my figurative use of the term “get half a chance” is tripping you up again."

Look at Five’s regeneration. It’s dark as hell, he isn’t even sure he will regenerate this time because he’s deliberately resisted the regeneration earlier in the story. And it fits perfectly with his - incredibly tragic - arc, so well that his regeneration is considered one of the best.

Whilst I don’t think Ten’s is quite as good as Five’s it does still fit the criteria. Whereas Nine, Eleven, and Twelves’s regeneration come at the end of some positive character development (Time War related or otherwise), Ten comes at the end of the ‘Time Lord Victorious’ arc, where his arrogance has gotten the better of him. As well as that, he’s in a similar situation to Five where he can’t save everyone and not die. With Five, he’d been unable to save so many people that in the end, all he cared about was saving one person even if it meant him dying. Ten was somewhat similar, except his rage was complicated by his grief and his arrogance, which seemed to grow stronger as his run went on 

Tl;dr I think Ten’s regeneration was fine, and - if anything - I think it’s a nice change of pace."
