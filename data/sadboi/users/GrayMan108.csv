I just hate how they let those frustrations boil over into bitterness and resentment because they fail to realise that their actions are counterproductive. 

If women view men as scumbags, maybe it's time for men to start asking themselves why. Problem is that introspection is a skill that most people don't possess and the majority of people don't ever think they did anything wrong.

Look at the threads where people ask for advice on what went wrong on a date and proceed to lay out their version of events for that date. We're only getting one half of the story and the person telling us tries to paint themselves in a positive light. They're not asking for advice at that point, they're asking for validation that whatever went wrong during that date wasn't their fault.

Movie villains don't ever see themselves as the bad guy. Same thing applies here. People want to believe that they're good and infallible, that they can do no wrong. Problem is it's complete bullshit. We're human. We're supposed to make mistakes and own up to those mistakes so we can learn from them.

I don't fault these actors for not saying anything because I also wouldn't choose to believe the rumours either.

I agree with playing single player to have fun, but it suffers from the same problem as online. There's not a lot to do with your money. If I could buy the same businesses as I could online and just build up a criminal empire that way, it'd be more fun. People say the reason they don't do it is because they want you to spend money on shark cards, but it's not like shark cards sales would drop (at least not much) if they added those businesses in single player because people would still play online with friends and those who buy the cards are still going to buy them."

Although to be fair with GTAV hitting Game Pass, I could probably see Microsoft throwing a fuck load of money Rockstar's way to make it a timed exclusive. I have both an Xbox and PS4, the Xbox is my main console though, but I will admit that Sony has some good exclusives. 

I think Microsoft knows they're lacking in the exclusives department, so getting their hands on GTA6 as an exclusive launch title, even if it is timed, would be a big fucking deal and I can guarantee you that GTA fans won't wait for it to come out on the PS5, they'll buy an Xbox X just to play it."

If you take a ten year old kid from a broken home with abusive parents and put him with a loving family, there's a 50/50 chance he's gonna go one way or the other. But if you take a baby born to abusive parents and put him with a loving family, he's probably gonna grow up to be like his new family. Same thing if you flip the families around, the baby will probably grow up to be abusive themselves.

If that cute little kid becomes an asshole when he's an adult it's because the parents who raised him were assholes themselves. There might be some genetics at play that influences their behaviour, but it mostly comes down to how they were raised.

But the main reason why I'd have a kid is so I could give them the kind of life I never had. Not so I could live through them or because I don't wanna make that life for myself, but because I want them to make something of themselves. I like seeing people succeed. I'm not only proud of them, I'm proud for them. Even if they don't consider what they've done a big deal, I do. I could walk past a random stranger in the street, overhear them talking about getting a promotion and I'll be happy for them. 

The thought of being a parent terrifies me and I'd probably hate it as much as I love it.

GTA6,fczz2xu,t1_fc4mfns,1578111109.0,"I've always felt that GTAV was a huge misstep in terms of story. The heists were good, but there was so few of them, they shouldn't have even bothered. The three protagonists feature could have been really interesting if it was about building a criminal organisation from the ground up, with each character playing a different role in the organisation.

Franklin is a young gang member who wants to run his own gang and be his own boss. One day he meets Michael who is a retired hitman out for revenge on the people he once worked for, so they agree to help each other. They get a load of drugs / guns that they can't move so they bring in Trevor who is a smuggler and an old friend of Michael to move it for them. 

Hopefully they'll do something like this for GTAVI. Honestly I just love the idea of building a criminal organisation from the ground up, selling drugs, running guns, robbing banks, stealing cars for a chop shop, doing freelance assassination / vigilante work for people, turning gangs against each other."
GTA6,fczxc59,t3_eg5msg,1578110234.0,">A casino based story in Las Venturas? A drug running story set in Vice City?

I'd be happy with either of them, but I mainly want the latter because we've yet to really have a game based around drug dealing. I liked the drug dealing in Chinatown Wars and I'd like a game based around that activity. 

The Scarface game was awesome, but I'd like Rockstar to take the concept of buying cocaine, bringing it to Vice City from South America / the Caribbean and selling it, but expand it to other drugs and businesses too. Arms smuggling, money laundering, counterfeiting. 

It'd be cool to start with nothing and gradually build up your criminal empire. You start with a legit job you go to and a small weed farm in your house. You go to work earning legit money, sell the weed you grow in small quantities, rob petrol stations and houses, sell whatever you steal to pawn shops, steal cars and sell them to chop shops, sell weapons you find individually.

As you grow in power and make contacts, you're able to do more to earn money, with each activity giving you more profit but also increasing the risk. 

So in regards to selling weapons, when you hit a certain level in that activity, you can sell them in bulk, but it involves you driving them to the drop off point and possibly being attacked by a rival gang or the police. Same with the drugs you make or steal. 

Plus you can eventually hire more workers and buy more factories to make your drugs, and buy warehouses to store everything. You can start a money counterfeiting operation, an art forgery operation, a chop shop. You can eventually steal from banks and jewelry stores or even police station evidence lockers. We could maybe even dabble in white collar crime such as Ponzi schemes and insurance fraud. We could own legit businesses to launder our money. 

I also think it'd be interesting if they ditched the traditional storytelling method and made it more character driven rather than telling an overarching story. So we do five missions for a biker we can sell guns to and we can't do anymore until we hit the next level of our gunrunning business. 
. 
We'd be able to do the whole story in one sitting, but it wouldn't follow a rigid structure. Maybe drug dealing could be the main story with a rigid structure we have to follow, but everything else is like a side mission / business. We don't have to sell guns or open up a counterfeit money factory if we don't want to. It's purely optional, with drugs being the main focus, but the other things are still are a big part of the game.

Rockstar aren't exactly strangers at breaking conventions and doing something new, so I could see them moving away from  standard storytelling and they've already got the framework for the kind of activities I mentioned with GTAO. I don't see why they couldn't make a single player game with that kind of depth. 

I'd prefer it if they gave us more to do and allowed us to actually feel like a criminal running an empire, than extraneous shit such as needing to eat, sleep and maintain your temperature."

I can only speak about women's profiles here, but I get why they put things like this in their profiles. They wanna paint a picture of who they are, the problem is that other women have the same idea which makes it generic and ultimately boring. Another problem is that YOUR HOBBIES ARE NOT YOUR PERSONALITY.

Your hobbies are what you do, your personality is who you are no matter what you do. 

''I like to travel, I like to keep fit, I enjoy nights out but also nights in with a takeaway and Netflix, I love gin, I'm up for spontaneous adventures, I like animals, I hate small talk...'' 

If your hobbies were your personality and I saw that profile above, I'd think you were boring and basic. 

If I see a profile like that, chances are I'm not gonna message them. There's nothing to work with. It's just as bad as an empty profile. I'm not gonna ask someone who has ''I like travelling'' where they like to travel because it won't be the first time nor will it be the last time they'll be asked it.

Seriously, any woman who is getting frustrated with the same shit copy and paste, no-effort messages off men they've received a hundred times before, take a look at your profile and if you see anything like my example above, change it. 

If you want people to actually put effort into messaging you, put some effort into your profile. Don't just stop at my example above, expand on them.

I like to travel = where do you like to travel? Beaches, snow topped mountains, old European cities? 

I like to keep fit = how? Running, weights, swimming, surfing, indoor rock climbing? 

I enjoy nights out but also nights in watching Netflix with a takeaway = where do you go on a night out and who with? what do you watch on a night in and what takeaway do you have? 

Saying you volunteer at an animal shelter not only tells me you like animals, it also tells me you're kind. Saying you boarded the Alps, surfed the Great Barrier Reef and explored Prague tells me you're quite adventurous, you like to travel and is into history / architecture. 

If I see that you've been to Prague and I've been to Prague, it makes starting a conversation that much easier with you. I haven't been to Prague I'm just using it as an example. 

If you are genuinely serious about finding a partner online, the more information you give someone, the easier it is to form a fucking connection with them. Don't just put generic shit and top it off with ''if I put everything on here we'll have nothing to talk about'' because in doing so you're not gonna be talking to anyone.

In the two weeks I've played it, I've finally bought a vehicle import garage and a nightclub, due to doing the casino heist a few times and selling shit when it's quiet. I've now got maybe 500k.

The problem I have is that since I haven't got enough money to fuck about with, I find myself having no fun with the game. I don't really give a shit about having a lot of money, ten million will make me happy. I know that it's probably easy to make ten million if I just spammed the heists, except I don't wanna do that.

I honestly think that if people wanna do the PVP, it should be limited to those who aren't in an organisation or MC. So if you're in one of those groups you can't be targeted by anyone nor can you target anyone yourself.

AskReddit,fcp21s7,t1_fcp02s5,1577848071.0,"She actually told me she really loved what she did because she was making people happy, and that most of her clients were really nice (I used to be one of them, I made a post about it a few days ago actually). She only ever escorted four days a week and saw maybe three clients each day, charged £100 each time (except for me because we knew each other from before). 

The reason she stopped is that she never had time for herself. Once she found the events planner gig, she quit her chef's job and stayed on as an escort for two more months, then eventually stopped doing that. She's got more free time now, the work is less physically demanding and she earns a bit more money too."

Come to think of it the day she actually told me what both of her jobs were like is actually the only time I've ever seen her cry. She's the most upbeat person I know, but I could tell that it got to her sometimes. She's an event planner now."

AskReddit,fc9mmok,t1_fc6w2ea,1577554958.0,"One of my best friends is a retired sex worker and it's like her second job is my personal therapist. I always leave her place feeling better about myself, only problem is she's an event planner now, so she's always away a lot and I only see her every few months, just not as a client anymore. She is the most happiest, upbeat person I know. 

It's fucking weird how we even met. I was 24, had just visited an escort a month before to lose my virginity and it was awful. The escort was lovely, but I was too nervous to really enjoy it. So I decided to try again with a new escort because I was too embarrassed to visit the first one again. 

I arranged a meet with the new one, went around to her house, she opened the door and I walked in. She looks at me oddly and says ''I know you''. It turns out she actually lived in a flat my parents rented out when I was 15 and she was 20. I didn't recognise her, but she recognised me and it was one of the most weirdest moments of my life. I think we only saw each other maybe six times in the two years she lived in the flat. 

It was fucking awesome. We were talking, catching each other and having a laugh, she told me she'd been escorting for about six years at that point (this was about four and half years ago).  We were talking so much, we didn't even realise an hour had passed and we never even got to the bedroom. We get into it and after we finish, as I'm paying her, she says ''nah, piss off, your parents were always cool with me if I missed rent, call it an even 50 rather than 100 and if you come back, it's all you need to bring''.

I visited a few more times after that, same deal as before. The last time I went to see her as a client was my 25th birthday and when it got brought up in conversation, she actually offered to call her duo partner around for an FFM.

I said that I only had enough money for her and she just replied with ''don't be daft, it's your birthday, I'm not gonna charge you, just pay for my friend's time''. I said it was really nice of her and I'm flattered she'd do that for me, but I'd rather spend time with her alone (at that point I kind of decided it was gonna be the last time I saw her as a client and I wanted it to be special I guess). We spent the whole day together and she didn't even accept payment from me. Just gave me a hug and a kiss before I left, and told me to enjoy the rest of my day.

I never visited her as a client after that because I was a bit concerned I might catch feelings for her and I was worried she wouldn't feel the same. So we just became friends instead and she didn't seem disappointed. I met my ex not long after that anyway. But we still see each other whenever she comes home on a break from work. I do miss the sex, but I'd rather keep her as a friend than lose her altogether. She's probably the one good thing in my life and the only person who keeps me sane."

We got to sexting instead (which she initiated by the way), made arrangements to meet up a few days later and the next morning she told me that she was too busy, few days afterwards she told me she didn't want a relationship, that she wanted to focus on herself and her kids. I just hate how she tried to act like she was being honest with me."

He didn't actually kill me or destroy my vehicle because I was too fast, but it was obvious what he was gonna do. So even though he didn't destroy my cargo, my friend and I still killed him repeatedly for about half an hour until he left. 

Someone blew up the vehicle cargo my friend was driving in a two car selling mission the other day, so we considered them fair game after that. My mate had his flying bike out, I was on foot with my LMG and RPG. They eventually called in an AC-130. Didn't help them and they eventually left. 

Way I see it is don't play stupid games if you don't wanna win stupid prizes. If they wanna blow up my cargo they can go right ahead, but I am gonna spend however long it takes fucking with them until they leave. I'm just in it to deliver cargo and deal with my businesses, I have no interest in fucking with other players unless they fuck with me first. Live and let live is what I say.

Honestly it just pisses me off when they mess with you first, you get revenge and they eventually go in passive mode after so many deaths. I just hate people who can give shit, but can't take it."

But I'd never walk up to a girl in a pub and try to chat them up. I'm too shy for that.

People say you shouldn't agonise over why someone ghosted you, problem with that is, humans overthink and overcompensate. If someone gets ghosted for no discernible reason, they start looking for reasons why they got ghosted and the next person they message isn't gonna have the same type of conversation the ghostee had with the ghoster, because the ghostee is trying to make sure they don't fuck up again, even though they didn't anyway, which in turn leads them to fuck up.

dating,fc3v8pj,t1_fc22cjr,1577399500.0,"The thing is those guys who blew up on you weren't mature enough to be rejected. They're just shitty people. But I think online dating really fucks with guy's self-esteem, so if they're blowing up on you in a message, it's not just gonna be because they're a piece of shit (although that might be the case for some people), it's because they've grown bitter from the whole online dating scene. They're tired of being messed about, talking to people and thinking it's going somewhere only to get ghosted not long after. When you deal with that kind of shit on a regular basis it's hard not to let it get you down, man or woman.

Ghosting might seem like the smart, safe thing to do, but it's kind of cruel. If I get a message off someone and I'm not interested in them, I just won't reply. It's never happened, but if I were to receive a message off someone I was interested in and then later learned I didn't feel anything, I'd tell them. But usually it's me messaging them first, so obviously I'm interested in them.

People say that women always get shitty replies when rejecting men, verbal abuse and shit like that. This is exactly why though. They've been ghosted that much, it turns them bitter. I know the feeling. I don't like feeling like I'm a toy that can be disposed of when they get bored of me. Have the fucking heart and guts to at least tell me that they don't wanna speak to me anymore. I will respect them that much more if they do that.

Look at it like this, even if you get back together, you've both changed. You are no longer the people you both fell in love with. And if you somehow managed to get back together and carve out a happy life together, it's not gonna feel the same as it did the first time around. 

You read stories about people who broke up, got back together again years later and say they're happy. But are they truly happy? Are they as happy as they were the first time they went out? I doubt it because the dark cloud of that first breakup is hanging over their heads. 

I have a friend who breaks up with his girlfriend every couple of months and they always get back together. But let's be honest, that's not a healthy relationship. I don't think either of them really love each other, they've just got kids together. They're just one of those couples who can't live with each other, but can't live without each other too. And truthfully that's not a relationship anyone should want, even if it means you get to be with your partner. 

I used to think the same as you, used to wish my ex would get back with me, but all it does is damage you. Clinging onto hope is gonna fucking destroy you every single time a text comes through on your phone and you excitedly pick it up thinking she's sent you those four magic words ''I want you back!'', only to realise it isn't from her and it's not those four little words. 

Your heart breaks all over again. And the reason it breaks all over again is because you're clinging onto a fantasy that is more than likely never gonna be a reality. I know, I've been there. 

Trust me, mate, the sooner you grieve, accept that it's over and dispel any notion you have about getting back together at all, the happier you'll be. It's easier said than done, I still struggle with it most days, but now, whenever I get a text, I don't pick up the phone hoping it's from her. It'd be a pleasant surprise, since we haven't spoken in two years, but I no longer hope that each text I get is from her. 

The longer you hold onto hope, the longer it'll fester into something you don't want to feel and that's resentment because I've felt that too and it's not something you want to feel over someone you were once in love with."

The script is just a blueprint, the actor is the architect who looks at what's on the page and determines the best way to get those words across. Even if they're written so that they're meant to be conveyed in an angry tone, the actor can add a bit of playfulness or humour to the line reading."

I feel like since Geralt is already a fantastic Witcher anyway, his bestiary and alchemy knowledge should be high to begin with. Instead you have to unlock the alchemy potions by finding pages and you have to unlock the bestiary pages for each monster by encountering them. 

People always talk about how they feel immersed in the game, but it's the opposite with me and it's because I'm not a walking glossary of alchemy and monster knowledge.
