trees,flr7rfa,t1_flpdg38,1585414712.0,"Yes, it is somewhat true. We mostly have two kind of scenario in our nation, big town and small town scenes. 

In big town the cops are very strict, so it gets tough to get pot and not everyone who is new in town gets pot easily, someone who is a regular needs to vouch for you. Also, due to the involvement of cops the prices are high, nearly 40 dollars for 50grams or so. The regular smoker in these region are people who are inspired by the hippie culture and so on. People smoke very secretly here.

In small town the situation is totally different and it is because the regular smokers are mostly daily wage earner kind of people, like farmers, sweeper, janitors etc (also students but majority are these range people). Thus, you get pot in small tobacco shops everyone in the town knows about it and no one gives two fuck about it even the cops. It is because the sales here is less and so is the price, you can get almost 20 grams for 1 dollar and people don't even spend a full dollar to get high. In villages after sunset you will find old folks lighting chillums with their pals just outside their houses and not a single soul bothers them.

Also, you mostly get land race and brick pot here and they are only grown in village like ares where cops do not bother much. The only time they bother when it is smuggled to different places, that too is a rare event. Cheers bro."
