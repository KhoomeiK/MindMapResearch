AskReddit,epwdqmj,t1_enps6on,1559573236.0,It’s laughable now but daaaamn I was pissed! Idk why but it REALLY pisses me off when people mess with my food. I asked a friend in college to watch my plate (2 pieces of pepperoni pizza) while I went and got a drink in the cafeteria and came back a few minutes later and he’d eaten all the pepperoni off the pizza!! I got so mad I cried! Pretty hilarious now but boy was I pissed!
