Parents,f4rjpbj,t3_d36imn,1571768380.0,"Hi parents. I am a 15 year old girl, I get good grades, I’m very responsible and I’ve worked with kids in the past. I want to become a babysitter on the weekends. Would you hire me if you saw an ad of mine?"

Advice,f44p4va,t1_f44m87f,1571356405.0,My main problem with getting a job would be transportation. My mom and dad both work until 5 or 6 every night. I don’t know if I would be able to find a job where I could work with those hours. I don’t even know if my parents would be willing to bring me.
Advice,f44lz1g,t1_f44lw8i,1571354878.0,A little too risky
depression,f2zarxg,t3_del3c8,1570512556.0,This has happened to me before. My dad really didn’t understand what I was going through. I ended up reaching out to the suicide hotline for my area and that turned into a whole big thing too. Even after the fact my dad still tried to make it about him when we saw my therapist as a family. Parents suck sometimes and really just don’t get it and for whatever reason won’t just listen. It’s the worst feeling in the world to have your pain compared to other people’s pain. The truth is your pain could be and probably is as bad as theirs. Just because you have something they don’t doesn’t mean your life is automatically going to be better or mean that you will be happy. I understand what you’re going through and definitely do not think it is any less valid than anyone else’s hardships. You will get through this chapter in your life and be able to help others in the future. I believe in you. Best of luck
AntiVaxxers,f2u6oyn,t1_f2sla1j,1570408755.0,I agree that being obese is your responsibility but I also think that fast food companies should be held to certain standards as far as the health of their products go

AntiVaxxers,f2rstf1,t3_bz2g2t,1570376229.0,I kind of understand what he is saying while obesity is not contagious and measles can be easily prevented by vaccines- the government isn’t trying to stop obesity and continues to let fast food companies profit off of those who suffer from obesity and need help. But seriously the way he worded it🤦🏻‍♀️

Advice,euns024,t1_euk4zov,1563932714.0,Thanks for the advice it really helped! I went in today with a whole different attitude. This position isn’t about impressing her it’s about having fun with the kids and gaining experience! I can’t thank you enough! I definitely felt like i was just being dramatic and I should just to my job but your advice really made me realize i didn’t have to sign up and give them two weeks out of my summer. I also talked to my mom and my friends mom and they agreed that this lady is completely taking advantage of us being young volunteers! Today she even tried to make me do the job that the counselors who are being paid are supposed to do. (they haven’t received that good of training and they don’t work great with the kids) It might be horrible to go through but I have already made friends with the other volunteers and i’ll have memories to laugh at when i think of how crazy this woman really is!
Advice,euj3d4b,t1_euik5dn,1563861418.0,I would love to just quit but I spoke to my mom and she says that I have to stick with it since I made a commitment. I also have a friend who is depending on me to bring her everyday. It makes it really hard for me because I feel like I am really being under appreciated and even humiliated because I don’t have any experience with kids and I get nervous talking to new people. I am more comfortable with the kids than I am with her and she doesn’t see the work I am doing. I have been crying for hours because of this because I feel so embarrassed and stupid.
