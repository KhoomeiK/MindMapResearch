Then I stopped and am not doing the outdoor things I want to do. This goes for my friends wedding that I'm supposed to be a bridesmaid for too. He said he wouldnt go, flat out, no discussing options.

 It's also on his birthday, but then that leaves me wondering if he even cares that I won't be there to celebrate his birthday with him. His friends always take priority.  

It's frustrating, and luckily covid has postponed the wedding, but itll come up again."

philosophy,fk33l9l,t1_fk31yhv,1583816593.0,"Societal pressure can also motivate someone to stand up to their word. Someone may want to be a certain way but not feel they have the confidence to actually act on what that means. if integrity is one of their values, then by saying you are a certain way, you are putting pressure on yourself to hold up to that standard/become that person so as to not let down your peers. 

The act of saying ones goals can motivate a person to achieve them and be their authentic self"

How do you open up about the tough stuff?"

I promise you that's not the truth! 

Start small. Pick one thing you want to accomplish in a day (go for a 20mon walk, read a chapter of a book, text a friend), and celebrate the small things. 

Journaling can also be helpful. Write your shitty thoughts out, then write your positive thoughts out and do something else."

My take away is that you cant change for anyone but yourself. Who gives an f what he says about how much you want to change? You went to his office because you do want to change, for yourself, not him. You dont need him devaluing your own actions.

It's almost like a reverse psychology trick (but I'm no therapist)."

When I arrive in my new room I just cried, totally ost and alone. After the first week I settle in enough and now I consider it one of the best experiences of my life. 

2nd time was tough, but working out 3 times/ week was the best thing for me. Find a  class to go to so you can get out and socialize. Just dont get stuck inside your house, or only at work. See if there are facebook groups you can join for people with similar hobbies.

On a side note, what if you're super sensitive to your spouse or best friend doing this you you? I've learned that he puts me down in front of other people to make a joke and I just blow a fuse, or have this silent panic attack while everyone is watching.  

This last time I managed to tell him to stop putting me down and he did, but he says I cant take a joke, that of course he didnt mean it.

I also talk myself down to him and he says I have low confidence... starting to think its connected after writing this. Blah"

I had to stop drinking so much because I realized I would wake up at 4 or 6am and lay there thinking about how my dad, my husband, or other loved ones would end up just dying any moment. I felt physically nausious and wanted to be with them to know they were okay.

It's a shitty feeling and I still have it some days worse than others. 

I try to think of it as the process of learning how good we have it each day when we have people we love above ground. Dont worry about tomorrow or the past when you can't change it, just try to enjoy it.

Remind yourself you survived and it probably wasnt so bad.

They're rough. A bath, a workout/yoga/meditation, or some ocean air always helps. If that's not good enough, its food!

careerguidance,eyuz12e,t3_cytr5u,1567475946.0,"A BA will definitely help you get a job in the professional field. I can second your sentiments about not knowing what to go into, but I know I got the job I have because of it (I have a communications degree) and I'm 120% happier now that I'm out of the restaurant industry.

 I spent 10 years at a restaurant as well, and mixed it up with about a year of admin work. When I came back to the restaurant (because I couldn't find another job in my indistry) I chose to go into management. Restaurant management sucks though, so save yourself the trouble and just get a job at a company you like! 

The sooner you can start getting ANY experience in an office, the better. Start applying to companies that you think are worthwhile and just see where it goes. My sister is the best example. She got out of restaurants by cleaning machines and doing inventory at a medical company. Now she almost runs the office 3 years later. 

If there's a business, product, or lifestyle company  that you're interested in, there will most certainly be someone who can use you. Dont be surprised if you jump around a bit in the beginning, it's not a bad thing. This is a whole new world and office politics can be just as bad as restaurant gossip. 

Good luck!"

My husband used to be a wam-bam and done guy ( still is to some extent), but I told him when it hurt and he got better. (Many times at first this would end the session which was awkward, but he learned). When changing positions even, go slow. Work your way up to full throttle and ask her if she's liking it. 

I wish my husband communicated more in bed too, it's a no talk zone somehow but i have hopes we'll get better. Sounds like you guys dont communicate much either. It's part of the fun though, so see if you can talk through it more."
