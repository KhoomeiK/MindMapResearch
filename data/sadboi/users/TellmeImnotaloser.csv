depression,fox1wqw,t3_g9ndgw,1588132127.0,"I stopped living senior year of high school. I went crazy with freedom and was partying every weekend, leaving school halfway through the day without permission, gave no fucks about classes. Took no control over my finances and didn't re-register my car after it had somehow expired within a few months. I was so high on life, and marijuana. Then my car was impounded. And I had a criminal charge for being caught with a bong. This was that summer; a week before I was going away to college, my parents basically said ""no."" I think I just broke and I completely fucked up my second chance at community college. And now jobs corps seems like my only shot at a decent future. Only through blood and sweat will I ever get back to school. Point of the story is I died somewhere along the way, kept fucking up my life not going in any one direction, and completely pissing away all of my money while desperately trying to maintain a weed habit. I fucked myself. Fuck life. The beggar can no longer be the chooser. My fate will be determined by what opportunities I'm able to take advantage of whenever they come up these days. Very uncertain. Fuck it all."

PoliticalDiscussion,foo8d0w,t3_g5tbj9,1587934484.0,"I think it actually helps, because Trump is more likely than Biden to aquiesce to the policies the progressive movement it fighting for. 

You see, the Republicans and the Democrats are fundamentally very similar. The majority of both parties are essentially totally okay with the current status quo. The progressive movement, by definition, is not. The other big issue alienating the progressives from the two major parties is the heavy influence of big money and corporate doners backing each party. Large banks, private sector delivery services, private sector tax prep services, big oil, big pharma, big Agra, wallstreet, the list goes on. Every company at the forefront of it's respective industry has in it's best interest to keep the status quo going. They do this through their donations to the two major parties. Both of them. I will repeat, both. Not one more than the other. The only difference is there is no wing of the Republican party that rejects or claims to reject corporate donations. 

Now, Biden has time and time again outright rejected several of the progressive's main policy objectives, like bringing into fruition medicair for all and free public higher education. This right here is an indicator he has not changed his ways over the years to being more in tune with the impoverished and working Poor's struggle's, which is one of the progressive's main concerns. He hasn't rejected corporate pac money. There is just no indication Biden will be any different from Trump as president in many ways. You think he's ""working with Bernie"" now? Yeah, I'm sure the Democrat corporatists are going to start listening to Bernie now. They don't have to. Most Democrats have aquiesced to Biden already because to most it's just ""Biden vs. Trump."" This makes the DNC happy. They don't have to give the progressives jack squat, and the literally *never have had to.* So no, I don't believe progressive neverBiden voters are hurting their own movement. The candidate himself has never been with the movement in the first place."
worldnews,foo4z3v,t3_g8gu3w,1587932601.0,"The thing about shrooms being used to treat depression is that you have to actually be able to act on whatever relevations you come to after you aren't high anymore. Idk I'm my experience it was a fun, insightful ride that lands you back in sad reality land. There is definitely value in it helping people see things they couldn't before. It's just that, there's more to it after that. Much more to do in order to try to change/manage/alter your psychological state, which can be really difficult it you are despondent enough."

depression,fofqgyq,t1_fofnid7,1587740997.0,Seems like I'm getting more afraid of life than of death to be honest.
depression,fofq89d,t1_fofkb64,1587740868.0,"Fear and depression I guess. I keep trying to push through and get things done, but I just can't shake the negative thoughts, the negative feelings; feelings like everything is too heavy. Also, deep feelings of personal shame. A lack of ability to truly love myself and hold myself to a higher standard. 

I've struggled with confidence issues and self image problems my whole life. I guess that's kind of better now, because I'm a little bolder than I used to be, but not by much. I've also always struggled with feeling like I'll always be alone and unwanted because I've always naturally been either a neutral or in some way negative force in people's lives. I have social anxiety and can barely tolerate having difficult honest conversations with people like my parents without staring at the ground or continuing the conversation in a spot where the other person can't see me.

 I don't know man. I just struggle in general to not let my mental issues outwardly manifest. But they do and I'm so acutely aware how it effects my life. I want to be that guy who wakes up every morning with a sense of purpose, who brings light into the world, helps others, and is always motivated to work hard and keep learning. But the problem is I'm just not that guy. I try to be as much of that guy as possible, but certain things like smiling at somebody just throws me off, makes me want to retreat. 

Now I'm at a point in my life where being anything but that ideal guy just won't cut it. Trying to find and maintain a job while feeling cynical and vaguely hostile, all while struggling to set the roots for positive relationships with my coworkers isn't going to cut it. I just think, how am I going to get anywhere in life if I can't even smile? I hope this didn't come off as a tangent. These are all the parts that add to the sadness I'm trying to kick. I've earned what I've got, which is to say, I have nothing. I don't know if I have it in me to slap myself together at this point. It doesn't seem feasible based on my experience living. Happiness, respect, stability... don't feel like choices."
