I used to rip chunks off with nail clippers; it hurt. The blade, however, provides large clean slices of callused skin with no pain. Soak in warm water for as long as you can first, of course."

I feel like I'd be at home there, killing and getting killed. In addition, people also seem to rank trauma with rape at the top."
AskReddit,f26kabf,t3_dbrhfh,1570014354.0,"When I was a child, I was taught to torture and kill animals.

My father was a hardcore survivalist. He was a child who had tapeworms and starved, resentful of all the fat rich bullies. He was later drafted into the marines, rejected by his father, survived homelessness, opened his own auto-repair shop, got married, had kids, and bought a house. He achieved the American dream. The Chinese people have had a long history of hardship, and they have more important things to think about than the rights of animals. My father was the same.

We were protecting our livestock. He caught a creature that was killing our chickens and we children took turns shooting it. My siblings grew out of it, but I didn't. I hadn't started school yet. I would capture more animals and torture them before killing them. At first, I thought it was a good thing to do. Then I did it because I was bored. Then it was because I liked it. My father was abusive and my mother died early. I was bullied in school and prohibited from retaliating. In my teen years, I tried to gain my father's love or show him how deranged he had made me. I achieved neither.

While I was troubled, I was still a lost child looking for love. I unwittingly told my classmates how I upset I was. Authorities were alarmed at my mental state and treated me as a suspect rather than a patient. The school was convinced I was going to be the next school shooter and rebuked me, punished me for scaring others. This made me feel even more marginalized and resentful, and I would continue to tumble down a pitch black rabbit hole. 

My life continued to be a tragedy. It has been almost a decade since the last one I did. I am still a monster at heart with urges, but I have committed my life to doing good. I tried to get a career and live happily ever after, but society rejected me continually, and I live as a lonely little wretch. I volunteer for non-profit organizations helping animals and at-risk youth.

I want to tell people what I am, but I can't, and while I rarely open up about this, I try to never tell the sensory details, no matter how much I want to."
AskReddit,f26inp3,t3_dc6d12,1570012276.0,"I am a monster. A miserable disgusting wretch. I know, people often dismiss me as cringy and edgy, but the facts of my history stand, and I can't put it any other way. Sometimes art imitates life. 

I am a monster, and I am miserable."

For most of my life, I have been raised as, regarded as, and treated as a monster. My father literally taught me to torture and kill animals. In high school, authorities started to suspect me as the next school shooter and started punishing me, not just rebuking, for opening up to my friends about my violent feelings. I constantly have violent thoughts, but I am a philanthropist and work for a non-profit organization. I haven't killed any animals in years and I don't hurt anyone but myself. Still, this city rejects me and contrives offenses to arrest me by. 

I know the reality of the situation, the system. I am seeking emotional release on r/offmychest. I'm wondering if people think I am a bad person, a violent monster, who needs to be separated from society for the greater good."
offmychest,f129nx9,t1_f128lp3,1569136942.0,Yes. I know.
