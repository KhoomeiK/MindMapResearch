kansascity,fc6qh2w,t3_egdnf0,1577486898.0,"Glad to see KC growing and becoming more “popular” per se, but man. I’ve got a lot of friends trying to become homeowners and seeing their look of defeat when they realize they don’t have a lot of affordable options makes me sad."

Merry Christmas and happy new year friend, sending you love and light."
Needafriend,fbtafek,t3_eedbsg,1577072746.0,This post is so wholesome. Sending you and your human love and light! I could definitely sit in front of my tv for 24 hours and play Overwatch as well. Who does your human like to main?
depression,fbta5nz,t3_ee58qm,1577072535.0,"I’m so sorry friend, you don’t deserve that treatment at all. I have had a very strained relationship with my mother as well due to her poor treatment of my mental health and it’s only just now getting better because I was able to leave home. The whole “blood is thicker than water” trope is BS. You are not obligated to maintain a relationship with anyone, especially if the said person treats you like shit. Like others said you will be able to leave one day, and the world will be much brighter. Until then try to hang in there, you’re important and strong as hell for going through this."
