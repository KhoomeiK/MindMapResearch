askwomenadvice,fnqvrht,t3_g3bk6s,1587173307.0,"Been there, done that. I grew up in a fairly religious household and had a solid group of moral friends. Went to college in New Orleans and had to learn the hard way that sex doesn't mean caring or love to men. It took me a few to learn and really understand that they don't care, and got date raped the first time I understood and tried to hold off.

My husband now is awesome, understands what I went through. He was never the type for a one-night stand. There are good, handsome men out there."

Btw, I'm the one that could have demanded child support but rejected it in an equitable divorce. I've owned my own house since I was 26, without any help from my ex. You do you though, I rest easy at night taking care of my husband and our blended family."
PurplePillDebate,f7jz85e,t1_f7it9sw,1573790282.0,"I may be a high value Stacey, but I tried to date a man in my late 20s when he was in his late 30s, he was highly successful and very attractive, promised me vacations and wealth, but I couldn't stomach the fact that his kids were closer in age to me than I was to him. Oh, and I happened to be a divorced mom with three kids at the time. I've since ""married down"" to my awesome husband, who is saddled in debt and I financially support our household, while still cooking and cleaning nightly, because he is my best friend, supports me, and turns me on. And as soon as someone wants to dismiss this as a one-off, I've been proposed to over 5 times. Women aren't hypergamous, most men are just shitty partners and can't recognize their own faults, so they blame it on the women they choose."

AmItheAsshole,eya8z54,t3_cw1zvo,1566959913.0,"I won't be popular on this, but maybe your wife is making due with her wine nights because she works her butt off, mentally, emotionally and physically, having to carry the brunt of the workload  (you don't clean behind yourself, you aren't responsible enough to help with household expenses without being told.) I don't blame her much, she was probably up cleaning after you with her music, doing chores. 

YTA, get your shit together, she isn't your mom."
BorderlinePDisorder,exgo0dk,t3_csldz7,1566269268.0,"Hello and welcome. I thought that I would overcome this years ago, and in many ways, I have. I'm in my late 30s now and the worst has subsided as promised, and happily married and I still feel alone and like crap on occasion. I've got a bunch of friends but no one I would try and burden with my stuff at night, but I need someone to talk to, everyone loves me but I can't be a burden to my friends. It does get better, but it lingers on"
bulimia,ex9skvg,t3_crn1er,1566093754.0,"This makes me feel crappy, I'm married with kids and I work, so I never get to ""binge"" the ways I would like, but usually I find more energy after purging, like a reset.

This is surprisingly kid friendly and super quick with minute rice:https://damndelicious.net/2013/07/07/korean-beef-bowl/

 These are all-time favorites that gets quicker once you make them a few times, you can use frozen onions and peppers to speed it up:https://www.kevinandamanda.com/chicken-fajita-pasta/ and

kids love this one, easy crockpot: https://www.recipesthatcrock.com/mississippi-chicken-thighs/

 

I love Swedish meatballs with egg noodles: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/218894/easy-swedish-meatball-sauce/

 

Also tacos and Spanish rice, sometimes I’ll cook chicken in salsa in the crockpot and have shredded chicken tacos instead of beef

 

Husband loves Italian sausage pasta, I buy jarred red sauce and sausage links, brown up the sausage links with green peppers and onions, add sauce, mix with rotini or penne

wholesomememes,et0oc74,t3_c9ki6b,1562382795.0,"I'm my husband's third wife (we are relatively young, he married early in the military) and he claims that he doesn't like cuddling, but loving and touching him is just my nature. And as much as he claims that it isn't his thing, he can't pinpoint it himself but he always says he has never been so happy or smiled so much. He's starting to be more comfortable after 5 years, he will lay down in my lap and loves being the little spoon, despite our significant size."

Call the police for a civil escort to retrieve what you can, and call it good. This isn't your fault. DM me if you need to. We aren't always the bad guy."

BorderlinePDisorder,erdf5gj,t3_c1hwmx,1560739998.0,"Can I ask how old you are? I had similar issues for a long time, I still even think of what could have been at weird moments. I'm very happily married now (36,F, second husband, first one was a bust, probably because of old hangups and young age.) It will eventually pass."
BorderlinePDisorder,eq8j438,t1_eq8edcm,1559866351.0,"Came here to say the same, I meal plan everything on the weekends and try to throw in a new recipe every week or so for variety. I usually do it on Saturday mornings with a fun cooking show on in the background for some distraction and inspiration. I pick out 6-7 dinners and a meal prep for lunches to bring to work. I write my first list in order of ingredients per meal, then re-write it in the order of the grocery aisles. It can be stressful sometimes, but overall it's a huge help. Saves money, as well. Routine in general helps me with my BPD symptoms."

I joined this subreddit in the same interest as r/inceltears but listening,  It's a bunch of guys that aren't great socially, trying to do better, and I appreciate that. Maybe say something that encompasses you're own interests and has a solid standout, use the open interests to your advantage?

I've been doing this for 20 years and only had it happen once 13 years ago, but please take it seriously, it's a good motivation to quit. Please do, I wish I could."
