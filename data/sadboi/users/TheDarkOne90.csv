I showed her, and she rubbed her fingers along them and looked me in the eye and said “I want to hear every story on these one day”. Just like that, she accepted me for being a dark person. I don’t have scars on my wrist, I never wanted to cut where somebody could see it, that’s just me lol. She was okay with it, she didn’t want me to do it anymore, and I worked on that. She never got to hear every story of each one, and yes, I remember each time and every mark which one was which.  Not sure if this will help, so I’m sorry"

Find something he enjoys doing. Hobby? Interests?  Keep his mind busy from the dark thoughts. Keeping the brain busy is key in fighting this shit. Go out to a good movie, Joker is coming out soon, plan on watching it :). Play some video games together or something fun and productive. 

Me, I enjoyed working on cars. Allot. Even opened up my own shop at one point because I was great at it. Kept my mind busy. Lately, my shit is so bad I just have no motivation to do literally nothing. He might need that little push to get out and do something he might enjoy.

She would never make me feel judged, and she would never make me feel like I couldn’t talk to her about anything. My mental issues eventually got better because I always focused on her, her and I became pretty damn happy. 

Something changed in her, not sure what. Now it’s like we hardly know each other. Now I’m back to square one with my old self. Now it’s like she doesn’t even love me. I have no idea what changed."
depression,f1xsyra,t1_f1xrq4b,1569803553.0,"I had this happen years back. In and out of mental hospitals, 3 times a week therapy, handful of anti depressants, and none of it helped me. Didn’t like the way meds made me feel, no matter what the dosage was. Therapy was just talking somebody’s ear off, and all I want to do is sleep. Mental hospitals just make you think you’re more crazy than you really are. 

Never again. If you ask how I got over that, I found my wife, leaned on her, she helped me get through it and the thoughts were always there but not this bad. Now that my wife is out of the picture, I’m a broken mess. Right back to square one because I was an idiot and never helped myself. Lost cause I am.

If you don’t believe me, if you are ever severely depressed, for an extended period of time, allot of the time you then get a cold or a flu. Because that shit weakens your immune system. Same goes for suicidal people, if they really want to die, there body will slowly get to that point and just give up. Best friend of my had been depressed for many years, got sick allot, he attempted suicide(hanging) but the rope broke. He was sent to the hospital just to check up on him and he ended up staying in there for 3 weeks because his body literally started to give up. I visited him the day before he died, he told me that he is just ready, he doesn’t want to be here. Shit makes me cry every time homie."

Boss noticed at the meeting the other day that I cut myself, he noticed the scars when I was scratching an itch on my elbow. I try to make them not noticeable. Anyway, I prepared for the worse to lose my job but low and behold. He was understanding. 

He gave me allot of tips that I have been given before, but a hotline number that our work provides for those with mental illnesses. He said they can get me doctors, treatment, and therapy to get better. He said it’s up to me to call but he’s honestly concerned that one day I won’t be here. I don’t blame him. I’m concerned myself. Not sure if I’ll call that number or not. 

My wife doesn’t support me on wanting mental health. So that’s very challenging. Iv had it before, years back when I was extremely suicidal. I got allot of meds and I didn’t like who I became when I took them. Theory seemed like the same ol bullshit. “Oh look on the positive side”. Motherfucker, where. Where is the positive side of this shit. Fuck."
depression,f1ngg8u,t1_f1nbkgg,1569616689.0,"I’m a smoker myself and I get the same heat. Not sure why normal people with no fucking issues think that you’re a druggie because I smoke Marlboro Reds. I’m right with you dude. I found a great job, and it helped me allot. Try to get into an industry that you’ll like. I can’t say the same for me, because I got into this industry with zero experience and it turned out I’m pretty badass at it. No college either."
depression,f1ng9cy,t1_f1nf93l,1569616559.0,"Thank you for your comment. I just want people on here to know that they are not alone. I can’t tell them it’s going to get better because it hasn’t for me. So I’m sorry. You are not alone, I know I’m just some random person on the internet but shit, these people, and these comments have honestly helped me some sort, have zero clue how but it just does."
depression,f1n30vp,t1_f1n2cew,1569607819.0,"PTSD can happen to anyone. My doctor told me I have that, one of the off spring demons associate is...  depression and anxiety. 

I just think deep down, I was damned from the start. I don’t think I was ever made to live. If I was, why the fuck did I have two piece of shit parents who just beat the shit and abuse the fuck out of their kids. It was bad. I still have the scars because of it."
depression,f1n1hrm,t1_f1n06q7,1569606821.0,"Sounds like my bullshit. 

My relationship has always been rocky because I’m not used to a big family. My wife, huge ass family. Me, just me myself and I here. Family issues on her end always come up. 

My wife and I are two different people. I had a rough childhood that lasted into my teen years, Iv been belated and abused for many years until I got old enough to run away. My wife on the other hand, easy going life. Everything given to her. She had school related depression, I had depression because of my upbringing. So we argue over that allot. She was never suicidal, she doesn’t understand it. I’m sorry for what you’re going through."

depression,f1mga59,t3_cml6ni,1569593234.0,"Well unfortunately I woke up this morning again, yesterday evening I was pretty sure I wasn’t going to make it. I stared at my 9mm for a long time. I can’t believe I have stooped so low. I don’t know any of you people on here, but it actually hurts my heart knowing about the shit everyone else is going through. What’s the point of living when life isn’t enjoyable. I really wish I could meet some of you guys, and just bullshit, have a pack of cigarettes, a glass of rum and just burn through the night."
depression,f1lsbgh,t3_d9sn3v,1569566423.0,"I think when we, few, depressed few, die, I think we are all reunited together, and get to enjoy our new life of real happiness with each other like minded people. I too, think after what will it be like once I pull that trigger."
depression,f1ls2nf,t3_d9wfgj,1569566084.0,"Not sure if you know but, it’s not legal to fire somebody over their mental health. Look it up. It’s classified as a disability act (ADA). Your boss would face a nice lawsuit over that. If you’re worried about this, document everything, start looking for another line of work because fuck people like that in general. Find a job where your co workers turn into friends and homies and people you can count on, with a boss that you would consider a leader and not a boss at all."
depression,f1lp2sh,t3_d9vhhx,1569562210.0,"I’m so sorry man and I don’t even know you. Relatable. Everything, relatable. I don’t see an end in sight for me as well. I’m not gonna spill about hope, gets better and all that bullshit. Some people are made for life, us, we few ones, are not. You can’t fight fate."

depression,f1lgd1s,t3_cml6ni,1569554087.0,So I’m hearing vapes are killing people by the day. Well I smoke cigarettes and that’s practically a slow suicide so I went out and bought a vape hoping for a quicker result. I’m find this comical and depressing at the same time lol.
depression,f1lg90k,t1_f1ld6g6,1569553993.0,I’m past that point sadly. I wake up and think fuck I wish I didn’t. Get to live another damn day damnit.
depression,f1lfagq,t1_f1lclll,1569553247.0,"And I don’t want to sound like everyone else. I don’t. And I’m sorry. But if you hold on just a little longer, you will find that person who gives that spark in your life, who changes your world upside down, who makes your depression and the demons go away.  

The day I got out of a mental hospital(attempted suicide #2) is the day I found my now wife. Now I’m not saying my story turned out to be the best but being married for two years, up until 4 days ago, has been the happiest days of my life. It’s a shame how my story will end so soon tho."

My relationship(married for 2 years is part of the reason why I feel the way I am right now."

It’s a sad day and age we live in. Human kind has ruined allot of good people, like us, among other things. I do, wish I could help, but I’m just some person on the internet.  I’m sorry. 

Sincerely, 

A very suicidal person."

Took one of my best co workers out to lunch today, gave a tip to the cashier, gave a homeless man after work an extra pack of cigarettes and a lighter along with 10 bucks. Got home and took the trash out for my neighbors. Called my sister who I haven’t spoke to in 2 years that I’m sorry for who I am.  Yeah, I feel like I finished off pretty good. I don’t know if I’ll be here tonight, or even tomorrow, but it’s been a long painful run. Cutting my arm again, deeper than I should but that’s okay, I’ll just stitch it up like the last one."
