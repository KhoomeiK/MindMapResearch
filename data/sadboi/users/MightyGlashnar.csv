BipolarReddit,fhbbufo,t1_fhalk2r,1581439059.0,"So bipolar absolutely messes with memory! Don't get me wrong, drugs don't help, but there is a fair chance that a good chunk of memory issues stem from bipolar.  Healthy coping mechanism are hard as hell, but really are worth the effort! I used to smoke a decent amount of pot to taper some of the side effects of meds or help with sleep issues (as it's legal here) and my brainpower *absolutely* just disintegrated, and didnt fix itself until I stopped smoking most of the time. Lifestyle plays a large role, so it might give you hope to know that it may not always feel this bad or this extreme :)


I find that specific extreme episodes can create big ol' holes in memory, so that's possibly what's happening with you. It's also possible that you have PTSD thrown into the mix which is just causing a bunch of havoc. Honestly, depending on your ability to afford one, therapy might help you figure out what happened and process it if that is something you're into. Don't give up hope though!



And having bipolar mess with reading is a huge tragedy, I'm so sorry. I know I'll go through periods where I'll binge on books, just obsessively read, and then I'll downswing into not reading at all. Is it possible that this is happening with you as well? It can be frustrating and definitely not ideal, but knowing that there will be points in my life where I'll love and get to enjoy reading gives me a little hope. Also, even when I'm not in the reading part of my cycle, if found that I can still devour audiobooks! It doesn't give me the same feeling, but it's still fun and can be a bit of a healing salve until I get to read again.


The biggest thing I encourage is even when you are down and feeling real foggy, is try to remember that ( like everything else with this illness) it will have varying strengths. So sometimes you'll feel like the London Fog has rolled in, other times it may only be a little foggy. Working on daily meditation, making sure you get a proper balance of vitamins and minerals, and constant ""working out"" of the brain can really make a difference! 


Being healthy is important for anyone, but I feel that with those who have any sort of mental upset, it can be absolutely vital to work on! Along with that though, no matter what happens, we need to try to be kind to ourselves, so even if our diet is trash, or you have unhealthy coping mechanisms, or maybe you just aren't doing what you feel like you should be, it's so important to remind yourself that it's ok to do what you need to do, until you have the strength do to what you have to :)


I'm sorry if this is just an absolute jumble, I tried to reply right upon waking up and my brain is having trouble right now haha



Edit: I'm not saying that meditation and exercise will make everything  magically better! But on top of proper meds, and if it's in the cards to do it when you can, then I'd say it can definitely help mitigate symptoms :)"

BipolarReddit,fh47iqw,t3_f1c9c3,1581276029.0,"So, I'll caveat this by saying that I've talked to a fair number of people who improved with med changes, coping mechanisms, and time- so it is by no means hopeless!! You might just need a med change and then be fine! 

However, this is exactly what happened to me. I used to have an incredible mind, and really cherished how well my brain worked. Writing, advanced math, physics, etc were my jam. About eight years after my final diagnosis ( I had gone through a few incorrect ones) my brain is now.. jelly. Unfortunately I can't blame it on the medication, as I've managed to do pretty well sans meds for about a year now. I have basically degraded down to leaving sticky notes for myself everywhere *Memento* -style. If I don't write it down, it's probably gone forever. My dreams of getting a masters degree or any of the career fields I had picked out are just that, dreams, and that super duper sucks. BUT. If you let it, it can be pretty fun (after the several years of flailing against the void trying to regain memory and going through the stages of grief a few times, this shit ain't easy). It can become a bit of a game. The people around me have accepted that this is just how I am now, I have figured out routines to make sure I can remember the really important stuff but for instance, I get to play games and watch movies ""for the first time"" multiple times. I may have a memory that I did play or watch it, but aside from really large details, most of it will be a blur.


I'm currently playing Skyrim again, and it feels like for the first time. I have a list of movies that I get to experience again. I am obsessed with picking up keepsakes when I'm doing or experiencing something- I have a shelf full of rocks that I've picked up during hikes, or specific events that are important to me, and this often will help trigger a memory. I take obsessive amounts of pictures, because if I dont, I probably won't remember. You find ways to cope, and trigger memory.


The biggest thing is not to give up! Even if you can physically *feel* memory and knowledge leave you, you can accept it's happening and still fight against it. Work on learning a language, an instrument, or fun activity. Keep your brain working! Always keep learning. Just because some of it's gone, and learning or remembering isnt as easy as it once was, try to let that fuel your determination to beat it! You may never regain where you once were, and that's ok, but try to learn to appreciate the journey, and try to accept that having a mushy brain may happen but that doesn't have to steal your joy.


I never had even considered a career in the arts or physical fitness before, I wanted *SCIENCE* and *GREATNESS*. Lol. Now, I run yoga classes for others whose minds and bodies may not cooperate with them. I take pictures. I paint. I still get to make a difference, just in a totally different way than I ever dreamed. I'm not saying, give up your dreams, by any means. "" Rage, Rage against the dying of the light"" and all, but just remind yourself that if you push and struggle and it just isnt happening and it just causes you more suffering than hope and joy? It's ok to find something that does work for you, maybe that you never anticipated.




Best of luck, friend!"

https://www.consultant360.com/article/psychotropic-induced-weight-gain-review-management-strategies

This further discusses weight gain and loss that I'm more familiar with (myself and anecdotally), and without linking half the paper, here is an example

>The incidence of weight gain with clozapine is considered to be the most significant at 4% to 31%,19 and one study indicated almost half of patients gained 20% or more of their initial body weight.2,20 

Even this example doesn't support the kind of numbers I was thinking of, so I'll need to do some more research

However,  I definitely concede that most of the results backed by evidence I have found are within the 1-15 lb range. And a percentage of weight gain I've found has nothing to do with medication itself, but more often people who have mental diseases. At that point it is very difficult to determine how much of it can be related to lifestyle and how much is the actual effect of the disease.

BadMensAnatomy,fdkpoyw,t1_fdk5gfm,1578508563.0,"I would respectfully disagree. For example, there are quite a few medications out there that cause significant weight gain and retention. I see this the most in various types of meds for mental illnesses. I have also personally experienced this with a handful of different medications, one specifically made me gain 80 lbs in five months, despite having a good diet and daily exercise, and I am still struggling with losing some of that. 

Don't get me wrong, it's completely on me to manage my weight, but when I'd have to give up my job to train like an olympic athlete to maintain a healthy weight, it's just not gonna happen haha.

This seems to be pretty prevalent in mental illness circles, with many people I talk to experiencing dramatic weight increase or loss. It may not make it *impossible* to be healthy, but creates a huge issue with people who may be having trouble with basic activities.




**Edit: is has been brought to my attention that not only are cases of extreme weight gain like this the rarity rather than the norm, but the primary treatment for this is dietary councelling.

While the studies I looked at stated that people with mental illnesses were often more overweight than those without, there are too many factors to pinpoint the actual cause, so it may have more to do with lifestyle than I believed.**"

I prefer things a little slower paced and more nature, while still having all the amenities and being very close to Seattle, so I prefer Kirkland, Redmond outskirts, or Bellevue outskirts. If you want tons of people and constant action, go for Bellevue or Capitol Hill. SLU is gorgeous, but I haven't lived there so I can't really speak on that one.

Redmond in general is kinda shit to live in, in my opinion. Tons of traffic, 90% tech and not much else. (Marymoor is the tits though, so is the Burt-Gilman trail)

Be wary though, all of those are insanely expensive, so if you don't have a pretty hefty income, be prepared to spend all your money on rent and not be able to afford to do anything.

Lower-income but still great areas would be Bothell and Shoreline. They get a bad rap, but as long as you either avoid or prepare yourself for Aurora or Lake City Way, you'll be fine. I've lived in both those areas as an early twenties female. And while it wasn't the safest area I've ever been, it actually can be quite a great place to live.

Timothy Zahn has some fun non- Star Wars books like *The Icarus Hunt*, which the writing isnt exactly top notch in my opinion, but are fun space romps with interesting plots

suggestmeabook,fc150pq,t3_efbpu9,1577308443.0,"I think *The Bell Jar* by Sylvia Plath is a must read for anyone, mental issues or not.

While it is technically a novel and not entirely autobiographical, the book was inspired by her own experiences with depression, and is a great read for anyone wanting to get a good view on what living with mental illnesses can be like.

Trigger warnings abound, so probably don't read it if you are not currently in a good place.



Edit: for a more in dept look at mental issues, and specifically bipolar disorder, and a humorous read, read *Wishful Drinking* by Carrie Fisher ( or really any of her books) or *The Secret Life Of A Manic Depressive* by Steven Fry. Often hilarious reads, well written, and very enlightening."

However, I felt that way after reading Catcher In The Rye, and upon reading later in life I hated the character even more haha. Either I just keep missing the point, or classics just don't hit everyone the same way."

While I don't believe that books can only be read and appreciated when you can properly ""understand"" them, I do think that high school specifically pushes a lot of books that can be hard to grasp for a bunch of people who have very little experience of the world.

That being said, at one point we spent most of the school year reading Russian classics, and while most of that was extremely depressing and hard to grasp for many people, I found the novel *The Idiot* by Fyodor Dostoevsky which had a huge impact on my life. I had struggled with mental issues for years at this point, and finding a very dark and anguished book that highlighted how to find beauty was life changing.

Fuck *The Pearl* though. Steinbeck is a phenomenal author, but we had to read that depressing garbage instead of his innumerable greats."

Did we get to read fantastic works of art? For sure. Did we need four years and hundreds of papers worth of nothing but how horrible the world is.


Edit: not just find beauty in the bad things, but also give understanding of what others go through and how to do something about it if we can*"

But I'm also a huge sucker of the death for the greater good trope, so take it with a grain of salt haha"
