-omaly means you have all three types but one is defective

-Opia is the most severe forum of tritan, deuteran, or protan colorblindness. It is not complete colorblindness like monochromancy.

-Omaly can range from mild to severe and severe forms can be difficult to distinguish from -opia. But in general it is less severe.

My issue is that the choice of moderates for the democratic party over the past 40 years has contributed to the shift towards fascism and without a rebuke of this shift will only further it. I'm worried about what happens after Biden when the growing crises of capitalism create more alienation and resentment that can be channeled by a populist who is both competent and strongly fascist.

Yeah, trump is bad. I get that. I'm just worried that choosing Biden won't have the effect of steering away from the decline to fascism that we want.

I admit i made this post while i was hypomanic and irritable and impulsive. I didn't think things fully through. 


My main problem is this. Unless we are willing to organize and approach the next election with a real progressive candidate that has backing and such.... the shift rightward of the democratic party will continue. The entitlement that conservative candidates like Biden automatically deserve our vote and therefore progressive candidates are risky needs to change. If it doesn't and people expect the left and center-left to line up for whatever candidate they choose fuels the mentality that we can't take a risk on candidates that represent us because a compromise candidate is ""more electable"". As it is right now many people have stated that they voted for Biden not because they agreed with him but because he was ""electable"". It is all because they see ""moderate"" dems as not being willing to swing for a progressive candidate but leftists will swing for a ""moderate"".

Electoralism will never bring about radical change. It is more about harm-reduction than anything else.

Consider this: Under the ""moderate"" politics of the DNC of the last 40 years the US has only shifted further and further towards fascism.  Constantly compromising with fascists has only shifted things in their favor.

Look at the pattern as it has gone. Sure democrat policies are slightly more palatable, but it doesn't matter when every 4-8 years the republican party regains power and undoes all of it.  

I'm honestly more scared of the next populist who runs after 4-8 years of more neoliberal policies than I am of Trump. Looking long term.. it doesn't look good.

You are wrong. The democrats have not moved closer towards our ideals... with every election they have moved further and further from them. Bernie was an opportunity to course correct that. Biden is a continuation of the shift away from leftist policies.

Capitalism won't fall under elections. Capitalism is unequipped to handle global warming and is killing us all. Capitalism is the problem and voting isn't going to change that.

schizophrenia,fcup43d,t3_ej0yj5,1577985679.0,"I disagree that you should never tell people you are schizophrenic. I find telling close friends helps them understand you better or at least clear things up. Maybe not new people (I just tell them I have disability for depression) but friends and such are not so bad to tell. Mainly because then they can be there for support during trying times. Having everyone in the dark means you have nobody to support you.

It depends on who you make friends with of course.

I've been upfront with people and it has only increased the amount of support i've gotten."

schizophrenia,fc9uu6c,t1_fc9s1wn,1577558548.0,"Schizophrenia is a cluster of symptoms for one thing. 

Basically you have to meet criteria A which involves hallucinations and delusions as well as negative and cognitive symptoms. 

A major difference is that schizophrenia delusions are usually bizarre. Furthermore the hallucinations back up the delusions in such a way to reinforce them.

A difference between paranoid ideation and delusions is that ideation you are at least aware you are being unreasonable or have some sort of doubt. The fact that you can recognize it as just paranoia points to it being paranoid ideation rather than a delusion. 

Furthermore, someone with schizophrenia has to meet criterion A for at least 6 months continuously without intervention. 


This is also complicated by the fact that schizotypal and paranoid personality disorders often co-exist with borderline personality disorder. It doesn't necessarily HAVE to be paranoid schizophrenia. It not only can be part of borderline personality disorder, but also be a symptom of another personality disorder.

The fact that they are related to things like familial stress and have a lesser impact on your functioning levels is indication that it is less likely to be schizophrenia.

I'm not a doctor though. So the one to talk about is your psychiatrist.

I'm just going through possible alternatives that it could be to schizophrenia.

An example of my paranoia is that i'm so scared that there are ai constructs who have replaced people and that the place i live is a experimental facility that turns people into simulants that i've been unable to function. I literally haven't left my room for more than a total of 15 minutes this entire week. So basically just to pick up food and meds. A major distinction is the level of impairment resulting from such psychotic symptoms."
