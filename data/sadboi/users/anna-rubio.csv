cockerspaniel,fglzg8x,t3_eyyuth,1580914681.0,Such a cutie! I‚Äôve never seen one this color before!
Anxiety,fg8h2be,t1_fg87cyo,1580619267.0,"I agree with the above comment. This is a complex situation and at the end of the day, you are a minor. Regardless of how mature you are (I am the same way especially when I was your age), there are certain laws/protocols that need to be followed for this type of thing, to ensure your safety and to avoid legal action. A school psychologist/counselor/teacher or general psychiatrist would have more information to help you out and possibly help shorten the process for you. Best of luck, I wish you the best!"
depression_help,fg8f39h,t3_exhaok,1580617615.0,Glad I scrolled through reddit today. Thank you.
orangetheory,femstd5,t3_epyo9f,1579268602.0,I wish my mother would do otf with me... the backstories sound similar. Best of luck to her and both of you! Take it step by step and just know that showing up is half the effort and a big step on its own! Some people don‚Äôt even do that.
orangetheory,fdl7222,t3_elxgw4,1578518140.0,Wooo! This will be my first birthday burn at OTF! Looks like it will be a good one :) :)
orangetheory,f84qxsw,t1_f84htng,1574258412.0,Agreed. I am semi flexible but need the help of the bosu to keep my form right/not throw out my back

orangetheory,f6m74sy,t3_drv3ah,1572967718.0,"Those long pushes had me ‚ò†Ô∏è ! Also I hate pop jacks!!!! I try to do one set but usually end up modifying them due to a lower back injury that occasionally flares up, and at that point I feel holding a plank would be more beneficial."
orangetheory,f6fzlev,t3_dr7dpv,1572819987.0,"My hr went down only if i did a ‚Äúrecovery row‚Äù after being orange/red for 15 minutes straight and on some of the floor workouts, (I think the tricep kickback with hinge, maybe once the v up alternating). Everything else had me working. 

Also I definitely recommend finishing your coffee at least 2 hours before going to otf. I notice a difference in my hr on days I do not listen to my own advice, today included üòÖ"
ArmyWives,f52x2iz,t3_dmfub1,1571953996.0,"Mine is at basic too, about 3 weeks left for us. I haven‚Äôt heard much either, they do that purposely. If you know his battalion and company, you may be able to find the facebook group for them. They post pictures and updates once a week."

orangetheory,f4r53e2,t1_f4r3qu2,1571762883.0,"Same speeds for me, so I concur! My coaches don‚Äôt emphasize it like that but I try not to let my HR drop past 73-75%."
cockerspaniel,f3x9sr0,t3_dih74a,1571234585.0,"Aww little lady! She reminds me of my cocker we put down a few years ago. He was basically the male version of lady. Tan coat, 14, named lucky. So sorry for your loss!"
orangetheory,f30aj1o,t1_f2zmh6d,1570550101.0,"It was such a great workout! I made it 6 rounds on tread and 5 on rower. I agree, I definitely pushed harder timing myself. Great job!"
orangetheory,f2ry3ma,t3_de4qy4,1570377568.0,"It‚Äôs tough, but I‚Äôve done it. Make sure to stretch, take a hot bath if you can to loosen the muscles and drink vitamin c (emergen-c packs that dissolve in water are great!)"
orangetheory,f2cjc2m,t1_f2cgf1z,1570138765.0,Good for you! I only got up to the .3 mile and 300 m row

orangetheory,f2agi4v,t1_f2af14w,1570113042.0,Me too! I was blue most of the time and I did try heavier weights for the step ups to try to make it harder but my grip and hands were killing me. Glad I‚Äôm not the only one!
orangetheory,f2aciry,t1_f29kpgw,1570111630.0,"Did anyone else not get as many splat points as they normally do for endurance days? I had 17 by the end of class when normally I‚Äôm in the high 30s.  Maybe because I started with the floor, or just had an off day?"
Anxietyhelp,f13yojw,t3_d7qnop,1569167244.0,"People have panic attacks at all different times of the day, maybe your brain is just anxious thinking about the day ahead. I sometimes try to plan my day the night before writing it down if I have to but more in my head. Clothes ready, food, what time I need to wake up/leave the house, what I need to take care of that day. Even if it is the same routine you usually do for me it helps me feel more prepared I guess going into the workday."
orangetheory,f0ymlj6,t3_d76c0n,1569073351.0,"Just got back from the 3G. Yeah there is no way I can do the dri tri because I was struggling at the rower (granted, I did that last). I personally loved the floor portion and the tread was good too. Maybe I‚Äôll be ready for the next dri tri :("

Anxietyhelp,eu6cnbq,t3_cewhxw,1563497244.0,"Maybe arrange to have someone you‚Äôre close to on the phone with you while you walk. I do this especially when it‚Äôs dark out- I get panicked that something bad will happen just being outside. It helps calm the nerves, even if I‚Äôm just going to the store. I don‚Äôt like people looking at me, I feel like they‚Äôre judging me (even though I know this is usually not true) and you look like you‚Äôre busy talking to someone so people won‚Äôt bother you. You kinda get to think out loud and have someone there with you. Hope it helps!"

depression,etznkqe,t3_c2fuf3,1563334281.0,"So true. I am pretty lucky that my mom doesn‚Äôt barge into my room (my dad does but he lives in another state so I deal with that only when I visit) but there are the occasional times they catch me teary-eyed fetal position etc. and probe trying to ask what‚Äôs wrong, when the majority of the time- nothing is really ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. I have to hold in sobs/cover face with pillow at night to prevent anyone from hearing and waking up. 

It totally sucks and I can‚Äôt wait till I move in with the boyfriend. He is super supportive and understanding of my issues and I love him so much."
