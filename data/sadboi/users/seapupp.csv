medical_advice,finh6xw,t3_f8turc,1582563288.0,"NAD, blood seems to be fresh and bright red vs dark and coffee ground consistency.  Indicating it came from the rectal area vs higher up in the digestive tract. With your other symptoms though, you might be heading towards a hypertensive crisis (stroke, worse, etc) and you should go to a doctor. 

Also, clean your dang nails man. Gross. But do the doctor thing first."

migraine,filxd1i,t1_filvx9w,1582512635.0,"Not yet, I’ve had the meds for about a week now. I wanted to get used to the effects of the propanalol before adding another new med on top.  Just an abundance of personal caution after being nauseous and vomiting for the month previous off and on. 

But, like, how do you know it’s time to take one? I know it’s a bit subjective. I see stories about these awful headaches and I just feel like mine isn’t that bad.

Haha, I guess it’s possible to have imposter syndrome in other aspects of your life besides work."
migraine,filtdfk,t1_filpfhs,1582509869.0,"The false positive thing is me right now. Especially since my doc thinks I’m presenting atypically. 

Started as a kid. Stomach aches. Light sensitivity. I don’t remember my head hurting though, but I loved using an ice pack on my head. It felt good. 

Fast forward, late 20’s. Various bouts of what they thought was IBS. Just had a bad one. This flare caused me to start throwing up. Light sensitive. Whole works. 

Propanalol 10 mg twice daily has helped with that, nausea, and the anxiety. Broke the vomit cycle I was in. 
She also prescribed rizatriptan for acute needs. 
Except, I don’t know if I need it. My head always hurts a little bit. Varying with tension headaches. Frontal headaches. Left side headaches. Sinus headaches. Right side. Etc. Every day is a different headache now it seems since I’m trying to pay attention. Which of those are migraines? 
Have I just normalized having a headache so much that I don’t want to cry wolf and not have any meds when / if I need it? 

After years of being told it’s all in my head and it’s IBS, or anxiety or depression, now maybe it’s “silent migraines”? It fits well. But I don’t know how to adjust. 

I’m sorry for the novel for a comment reply. I just feel overwhelmed in this thread. Everything everyone is talking about, I do. Forgetfulness. Fog. Feeling dumb. Doing dumb things and not knowing why sometimes. Words. I joke that words are hard sometimes. 

I guess, if anyone reads this, my question ultimately is how to know when to take a new scary med for a migraine, if I don’t really know what a migraine is? 

My head hurts with all this thinking."

I’ve poured out big clots I had no idea passed!  Before the cup with tampons and pads I’d be doubled over in pain from the cramps."
