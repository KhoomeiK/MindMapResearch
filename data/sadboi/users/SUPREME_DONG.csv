Tourettes,fen30az,t3_epynkt,1579275840.0,"So I‚Äôve done a lot of personal research on this subject (just smoked a lot lol) and I‚Äôve found that some strains will literally make me so twitchy I can‚Äôt stand it, while others calm me down immensely. Leave the sativa/Indica buzzwords at the door they mean nothing. Research terpenes and cannabinoids and figure out which ones are anti-convulsants, muscle relaxants, anti stress and anxiety and the corresponding strains, and you‚Äôll find great relief with marijuana. Leafly is a helpful resource. Having said that, everyone is different and some people will get relief while others won‚Äôt at all. Also, stable,  medically grown weed will also be more medicinal than street weed which is usually not very carefully grown. My personal recommendation is Sour Diesel. It‚Äôs a muscle relaxant and anti depressant, and helps immensely with chronic pain which I know a lot of us deal with. And, despite high THC content, doesn‚Äôt make me very twitchy. Hope this helps and if someone already said all this I apologize!"

With ABV You gotta mix that shit with something fatty like peanut butter or Nutella. Olive oil works too. And then let it sit for a half hour or so. I thought I couldn‚Äôt get high from edibles until I made 2 Nutella firecrackers with about 2 grams of ABV. Highest I‚Äôve ever been from ABV hands down.

abv,fa8tltc,t1_fa8rkzi,1575854408.0,"Sounds super fun! Groups can really make the dynamic fun. Lemon tek is when you grind up the shrooms and mix them with lemon juice, converting the psilocybin into psilocin (the active ingredient that makes you trip balls) before it hits your stomach. Your stomach does this naturally due to its acid content but the lemon will speed up the process by about 50-75%. I felt my first lemon tek dose hit 10 minutes after ingestion. Normally it takes shrooms 45 minutes to an hour to hit. Anecdotally, a lot of people say lemon tek will intensify the trip as well. I‚Äôd tend to agree."
