Life,fad1s6d,t3_e8jbtv,1575952723.0,"Yes you are.. and so are several million people just like you..... Just like steve jobs failed when he was thrown out of his own company. just like Jack Ma failed when he was rejected from KFC interview. Life is not about achieving a stage... it is about going thought the processes. If u think scoring x marks is what is important and will keep u happy.... then u will never be happy. even if u score x marks. animals dont understand milestones... X marks. X salary. X position in a company.

They understand the process and patterns. Just like a dog lives... they dont care if it is monday or sunday. they live... or even at times they die.... but they dont think in terms of success and failure... it does not matter to them....

If u think u r a failure... then think about the homeless children in south africa who are starving to death!"
