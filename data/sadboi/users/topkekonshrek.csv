Animesuggest,fl9dzu6,t3_fnfzwy,1584951373.0,"The volleyball anime is {Haikyuu!!} which is fantastic. Never enjoyed volleyball but after watching it you’ll love it. 

Full metal alchemist: brotherhood is fantastic and so is {HunterxHunter}. Both are semi lengthy. My favorite show that I would 10000000% recommend is {Steins;Gate}. It is about time travel but seriously is amazing. More recent shows that if watch include: Demon Slayer, The Promised Neverland, Dororo, Dr Stone, Kaguya Sama! Love is war. Besides that, Toradora, Clannad+Clannad Afterstory (my fav anime ever, very sad), Oregairu, Classroom of the elite, Anohana, Angel Beats etc are really good. Not sure if you have the time but I really enjoy naruto but make sure to skip the filler( just search naruto fuller episodes) 

In conclusion, I’m terrible at formatting but that is my tip of the iceberg for you"
bipolar,fivr3jy,t1_fivpjp4,1582766167.0,that’s the issue I went off antidepressants and I felt very depressed but when I’m on them I have wayyyyyy more manic episodes so I’m kinda trapped to pick my poison

Let her know that you’ll always love her. My biggest thing was the food. Hospital food sucks, so take her to her favorite place to eat. I’d suggest getting out or painting. Please let her know about this community. Lots of love going her way and your way."

bipolar,fhwtu33,t3_f54vvr,1581929918.0,"Bipolar disorder is a spectrum of symptoms. It’s easy to think that you’re either manic or depressed when in all actuality it can appear in so many different ways. I’m no psychiatrist or mental health professional but mixed states are not uncommon. It fact, that’s probably what you’re experiencing now. It’s okay to feel anxious or scared whenever it is something new. Mixed states are probably the hardest obstacle to overcome with bipolar. Sending lots of love your way"
bipolar,fhwt76g,t3_f50va3,1581929021.0,Younger than you but it all clicked for me at one point. You start to notice behaviors and saying oh shit this isn’t just because of nothing. I’m no psychiatrist but go see one and ask about mood stabilizers. Seroquel has really helped me. Sending love

bipolar,fhl56ip,t3_f3gt2i,1581695434.0,"Anytime you add an SSRI it gets worse before it gets better. Some people react well to them. Others- like me- don’t react well to them. Give it 4-6 weeks. Once it really kicks In it’ll either make you feel much more stable, or it’ll cause some rapid cycling. Make sure to stay on a good sleep schedule, stay away from drugs/ alcohol, and to exercise. A balanced healthy lifestyle won’t make things better, but it’ll let you know 100% if it is working or not."
