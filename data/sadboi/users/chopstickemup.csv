That‚Äôs cool you see locals helping out. 

In the 8 years I‚Äôve lived here, I‚Äôve seen a very different Singapore to the one you live in. I volunteered for over a year at a charity to help maids and workers and saw the ugly side of things here. 

I‚Äôm not saying every Singaporean is cynical, sorry if I came off that way. However in the posts here, I am shocked at the level of negativity at a nice gesture. 

My bf tried buying food for me the other day at Fairprice while I was at the doctor and he was pushed multiple times. I thanked the doctor for all he‚Äôs doing and he literally bowed his head to me and said ‚Äúthank you for acknowledging that‚Äù. So for you to say that doctors and nurses wouldn‚Äôt appreciate it is false."

I'm honestly just trying to have a normal discussion, which seems impossible. It is shocking that people are so unwilling to do the most basic thing to show support for the people risking their lives here. An honest question- if things got way worse, do you see locals helping each other? Based on the responses here, I would say no.
