I am a 24 year old AFAB Nonbinary Woman. When I was 12, I was watching a movie w/ my dad, abt conversion therapy, and someone kissed a character who was KO'd (no consent made me uncomfortable) and I made a face and said ew. 

My dad, who had recently lost custody of me  thought my mom was teaching me to be a bigot. So at 12, he told me that binary trans people exist(all he knew), and I asked what if I was a man, and he said we'd figure it out. 

So I sat in my room for an hour, and thought about all of the gender euphoria I had over being a girl. I didnt feel dysphoria when I thought of being a man, so I got to come back saying ""I think I'm a girl!"" And then we just watched something else. It wouldnt be until years after he'd passed away that I'd get gender feelings again and realize I'm nonbinary, but that is my favourite memory of him."

Also, these notes will help a vet or trainer more readily assist you.

I am slowly learning self propulsion for this too, but dont own one yet due to my living space being too small to store one and financial shit.

It is useful when I am doing short shopping trips and walking on very bad pain days. 

I am 24, was Dx's abt 2 years ago and have been at this level of disabled for about that long. Mobility aids helped me take back my life, I adore them. I just hate that they are always ugly and medical and how people are so tactless about them in public.

Amazon has lots of good basics items. I like their insulated leggings and they have lots of cute short skirts I wear with thigh highs.

Aerie has really good comfy sports bras and bralettes, and soft sensory and fibro friendly clothes in general. 

This summer im gonna experiment buying some really loose and holey mom jeans, see if it doesnt cause pinching and pain like all my old jeans do now.
