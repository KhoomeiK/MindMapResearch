cats,fqtkpxo,t3_gkvuoi,1589640899.0,"!INFO: we have a female pug and a male cat that were here for years before we got her. Pug is 3 and cat is almost 2. (The cats are both around the same age). She has gotten so much better over the past two months, as she used to SCREAM bloody murder whenever she saw them, but she‚Äôs toned that down a lot and only does it when she‚Äôs really aggravated. She still hisses and tries to go at them when they get too close. We haven‚Äôt fully introduced the kitties yet for fear of a huge fight.

We had her in the bathroom for a few weeks until she got comfortable. We switch her and Toulouse (male cat) daily and we have two litter boxes, so each cat has their own potty and neither one is cooped up for too long. He is very interested in her and wants to play badly. He keeps sticking his paws under the door, and sometimes they play, but she always growls and tries to bite at his paws. He sees this as playing though I think. 

Giving her up is not an option and we are in this for the long run! I would just appreciate any advice!

Also everyone is spayed/neutered."
