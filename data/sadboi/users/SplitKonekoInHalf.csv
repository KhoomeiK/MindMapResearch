mentalhealth,fn2smnm,t1_fn1g0c9,1586601672.0,"I think the diagnosis helped a bit to confirm what I had already suspected (I had depression/anxiety diagnosis for a while), I knew something more than depression anxiety was up so I just eventually met a psych enough for them to diagnose me.

A big thing was that I'd often not show up to psych meetups and that delayed any help obviously.

The thing is that even if a diagnosis helped I didn't really feel any different. We all know how insanely underfunded and under researched mental health is across the world. The main thing which has helped is being more self-aware and accepting that I will have struggles with mental health.

It's so important that you are able to get to a place where you can recognise like ""hey, wait a second this might be my condition acting up"" and then once you can get to that stage that's huge progress; from there you learn what helps you re-focus, like for me my walks and time alone are very big but I know for others it can be talking with somebody aware of your condition.

At the end of the day it's not our fault that we ended up with whatever mental health condition we have but it is our responsibility to try and figure our way through it. It might sound lame but what kind of motivated me is that I really wanted to be a good friend and eventually be good enough for my family and I isolated myself from people because I knew that my condition was unfair to make people deal with; I think I'm nearly at the point now where I can begin to put myself out there a bit more.

Bit of a ramble but I hope that's helpful"
