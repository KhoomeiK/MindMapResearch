AskDocs,fjafxd0,t3_fcastk,1583172683.0,"NAD, but I‚Äôve been in treatment for an eating disorder and right now the goal is to get you stable. Your behaviors are VERY dangerous and your body has been starved, any further weight loss could be causing more damage. Once you develop and maintain a healthy relationship with food, I‚Äôm sure they wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to weight loss but at the moment you need to heal your mind and body from starvation."
fuckeatingdisorders,fj3ncsy,t3_fbab25,1582988534.0,"My advice is don‚Äôt avoid it! Your body needs to heal, needs to learn to trust you again, and that means listening to your hunger cues. Extreme hunger is so common in recovery because your body has been in deficit for so long it needs the ‚Äúextra‚Äù food to repair the damage that has been done. Even with b/p, you‚Äôre malnourished. If you think you can get an extra snack or two to help honor your hunger without it triggering you or turning into a binge, get the snacks! Tabitha Ferrar has a few really good episodes on this. I know it‚Äôs scary, but it‚Äôs just your body trying to survive, listen to it, honor it. You got this üíï"
eatingdisorderstories,fixgcgh,t3_fa1dq2,1582819890.0,"Hospitalization was a life saver. I was inpatient for a little over five weeks and I won‚Äôt like, it was hard, there were days where I cried and panicked and wanted to leave, but it helped me immensely. It didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcure‚Äù me, I still struggled a lot for about a year after I was discharged, but it helped stabilize. I wasn‚Äôt constantly in crisis or panic mode anymore, I ate consistently and kept it down for 5 weeks for the first time in years, and having that stability and energy back gave me the energy to put in the hard work and mental energy that recovery required once I was discharged. I will tell you, no one ever feels sick enough for treatment, your ed will never let you believe you‚Äôre sick enough until you‚Äôre dead. If you‚Äôre being recommended for hospitalization, you need it. Be as honest as you can and sit with the discomfort, nothing about it will be comfortable or easy but it‚Äôs worth it! You‚Äôll have a support system, a vert structured day, usually with vitals and meds in the morning then breakfast and groups. Sometimes there are fun groups like yoga and ceramics. Keep a journal with you, I did a lot of collages and art in my free time. It honestly gets boring after a while so journals, books, coloring books, puzzles are all a great idea to have. Good luck, I hope you decide to go and get the help you need. Feel free to Pm if you have any questions"

In order to recover from a restrictive ED you need to eat 100% unrestricted. Capping your calories at 1800 and cutting junk food is restricting. 1800 is nowhere near enough when recovering, or even every day for perfectly healthy people. Healthy people eat junk when they crave it, right now isn‚Äôt the time to cut it out. Listen to your hunger cues, this includes mental hunger, eat what your body is craving, with no limits or food groups cut out. Your brain needs to rewrite and learn that it can trust you to feed it for the mental hunger to stop, because right now your brain is still waiting for the next famine, so all it wants is to eat in order to prepare. The mental hunger will dissipate with time once you‚Äôre properly fueling your body. Best of luck, I‚Äôm rooting for you."
