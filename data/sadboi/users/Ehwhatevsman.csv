It’s a tough topic and highly sensitive. Any good answer you want to find regarding sexism you aren’t going to find on the internet from strangers. There is almost a 100% guarantee you’ll get answers with bias or agenda. This is one of those topics to understand by experience, discussing with women and men in your life, and/or university courses. You also might be able to find some documentaries and books. Just keep an open mind and know that everyone’s experience is wholly different from yours.

If someone is being an asshole about what they believe are gender norms or expectations just ignore them. I’ve murdered my back because I’ve had coworkers refuse to help with lifting. I got to the point where I had to stop working if the people around me don’t. If it’s affecting your life/livelihood discuss with someone over head.

Partially to have your company grow and partially to prevent others from screwing you over.

There's other kinds of cut throat practice though. Disney gets shit a lot of shit for their practices.

Beyond that though get a lot of one on one play time in.

Omaha,fpsjj0s,t1_fpoago0,1588874529.0,"Honestly, from the sound of it you aren’t going to get anywhere. We just got a dog and people like this really freak me out. Based on what OP said someone came to a park with their dogs and had some trouble with one and so they kept it on leash. Our dog is just over 3 months and he is doing great, we can’t socialize him as much as we want right now because covid and he’s still getting shots but we do what we can. Still once in a while he freaks out. Just like any other dog or person.

One dog is stressful enough but four with one apparently having a panic attack seems difficult. It more likely went into guard mode for the sake of other dogs. Rather than help someone having a tough go this person apparently sat and a mulled over how rude they were being for bringing their dogs to a dog park. These are the kind of people who don’t want to be helpful, they don’t want to listen to reason, and they make up stuff that supports a created narrative just so they can exaggerate how bad they have it. Which always leads to false accusations or ear plugs while hearing someone else out. So yeah, basically a Karen. A gated vestibule is to help prevent dogs escaping. Leashing dogs does creat an isolated stance but it’s safer then letting it off if people like this are already tense from the start. And if they don’t care enough to help or say something while it’s going on then it clearly wasn’t that bad.

Yes if their dog is being aggressive they should leave. It doesn’t sound like it was bad enough that anyone asked them to. So it was probably some terroir or something that just snapped at op here at a point and now here they are talking about how shitty the dog owner is."

That said if leashing a dog at a dog park is against any rule it's the first I'm hearing of it, though some places have different and specific regulations. Wouldn't be bad to direct a comment to someone to have the rules posted somewhere in that area. That and most double gated entranced areas are usually to help prevent dogs bolting out.

I’ve had a number of relationships both platonic and romantic go south from a lack of respect of no and/or I don’t want to. There’s a weird permeating idea that someone knows what another actually wants or needs and that it’s helpful to get them to cave. If I say I don’t want something I don’t want something. If I say I don’t want to go, I don’t want to go. Assuming another person knows what is better for anyone is at worst controlling and at best infantilizing. Being willing to do things we don’t want to make someone else happy is absolutely part of a relationship but it shouldn’t be forced.

There is a time to be helpful of someone being self destructive and there is a time to respect their wants.

As an example. If, say, someone screwed up my order and I don’t want to turn back to have it fixed, that means no. That it isn’t worth the situation. Don’t continually ask if I’m sure."

A lot of the comments by the doctor are also as certainties and absolutes. Normally there will be an aura of doubt. We can say Trump exhibits symptoms of dementia or his behavior is a classic trait of sexual sadism/narcissism...so on. This tells me the doctor (who ironically I am inclined to assume is correct on a number of points) is more looking to insert his name into the narrative, that coupled with being a part of a upcoming book.

Plus a headline that says “sexual sadism”. You want someone to pay attention, sprinkle a little sex in. It loses merit to me in that regard. I understand the need. Though typically using extreme terms in a headline is an indicator that an article won’t be of value. Needing to get people to read by baited headlines doesn’t typically bode well.

All this said, I want to emphasize it isn’t even about being right or wrong in a diagnosis. Regardless of who a patient is, we have to be accurate and be able to treat and care for someone if we wish to diagnose them.

Please don’t misinterpret anything I say as an attack or me being doing anything but conversing.

I just wanted to get that out of the way.

I don’t claim to know more about personality disorders or clinical psychology than the doctor mentioned. If you know more or less about clinical psychology than me I am uncertain of. I have been in therapy since 14, diagnosed with schizophrenia at 22, and have friends/colleagues with various mental health/personality disorder diagnoses, all of which took years to come to. I do want to point out that a doctor diagnosing a patient they haven’t seen isn’t on par with clinical psychology. They might speculate, they might say “so and so shows signs of this” but they do not fully diagnose or present it as absolute reality. This is an issue that is brought up many times in history circulating around celebrities and political figures and hasn’t been too beneficial yet. We might be able to one day guess what a person exhibiting the type of pattern associated with “x” disorder will do but not yet fully. What it does is typically gives a outside group peace of mind knowing that a horrendous act occurred do to something “wrong” with the one doing/causing it. I think that has more to do,with disconnecting from our own ideas of what we could be capable of given a coin toss but that’s getting of track.

For a doctor to say they know for certain why Trump has behaved or taken action in certain events and it is do to “x” condition isn’t a great representation of clinical psychology. Especially when we take PR and media manipulation into account. I agree that Trump clearly has things that are wrong with him. I don’t agree that a distant diagnosis of a person who only lets a certain narrative of himself out (which is horrific considering everything that there could be hiding) is productive or would be 100% accurate. A lot of people want to make a name for themselves and I imagine in the coming years many books and movies will be made about this administration, all of which will be promoted and sold.

That said I am always very hesitant of hearing about any type of diagnosis (especially regarding mental health) from anyone other than the persons physician. Assuming the physician is non-biased. I don’t think Trumps physician is non-biased or at minimum is allowed to be. There are a lot of factors that go into a diagnosis. Sometimes they take years of talks, tests, and observations to reach. 

I don’t like this idea of assuming a diagnosis from a far, it is a road I don’t think anyone would want to go down in terms of an absolute. If we want to guess or speculate or figure out what would happen if so and so does have x, I’m okay with it. But I don’t trust a random doctor that doesn’t give an aura of doubt. Especially if the doctor or person making the claim has an agenda or something to sell/promote. I am far from a fan of Trump and he very likely has some issues going on with his mind and body that are pathological.

Other than the obvious stuff like hand washing and no face touching here’s a small list of random stuff that might help. Some we do/did at the specimen lab I’m at now, other stuff are things from previous labs I’ve worked, some of it is spitballing honestly.

clean hand/dirty hand. One hand designated to handle suspected contaminates and one for things you know are/should be “clean”. Mentally noting what you touch stuff relative to when you washed your hands.

Assuming you don’t have an eye wash station, getting  bottle of saline solution for eyewash to use and soap for your face if a suspect substance gets in your face.

 Designating a wash station of sorts, have a place to place hand sanitizer, saline solution, mouth wash, so on. If it’s possible to set up something where you can go into “dirty” on one end and come out “clean” on the other. Idk if that makes sense written out but think of a belt line of people washing up.

Same nature as clean hand dirty hand, clean room vs dirty room. If there’s a room or bucket or something  you can store suspect items that you can’t toss I’d use it.

Brush you’re teeth and use Mouth wash when you get home if you don’t already, wouldn’t hurt too much to use mouth wash one breaks.

Beards probably aren’t the best right now. Not sure how well this virus is at chilling out in beards/mustaches but I’m gonna guess it’s not great to have either.

Keep nails trimmed.

Shower when you get home. Or if suspected contact to exposure see if you can find a shower/get home to shower. 

Bringing a change of “clean” clothes to work if suspected exposure.

designated basket for clothes when you get home if you can’t wash them immediately.

Isolation basket for suspect items brought home assuming you can’t photograph paperwork than toss original (cam scanner apps help)

10% bleach solution is super easy to measure out if you’re able and don’t have better options, washing main counter between each customer.

Between each use the hood is wiped down with a steralizing chemical. Sometimes it's as simple as bleach but it can be anything that pass certain guidelines. Sometimes special chemical steralizers are used depending on the pathogen. When I worked in one lab facility that delt with pathogens we had to spray the hood down, wait 5 minutes, wipe it down, spray with alcohol, wait and wipe down again. Do this between each new study or type of specimen is introduced to the hood. It’s ungodly tedious. 

Anyway all the bits, pieces, parts, tools, are what go into the autoclave. Anything that just needs to be sanitized goes through a power washing machine. All the ppe we wore is removed in a way that doesn't touch us or our scrubs then tossed in bio bins and sent to be incinerated. Then we’d go shower and change before going into a different room or leave for the day. The room (usually tiny) itself gets moped with a harsh agent, walls/doors get scrubbed, and each room (like 16 in all I think) has a air flow to it that causes air to suck in and through a special filter rather than allow breeze to escape when you open the door or just in general.

Anymore the ""crazy woman"" archetype is more associated with a person being vindictive or activity trying to cause harm without realizing they're in the wrong.

Everyone is an asshole and gets angry at some point and I notice women get called bitch in terms of implying rude or cruel.  The term bitch implies weak or feeble when used on men. But I notice there are women who are more likely to assume that their womanhood is what causes rejection/complications in a relationship or social setting rather than their attitude. And there are men who assume their attitude is what causes trouble and in an attempt to adjust it become misogynistic in a bizarre bout of irony. Rather than just seeing people as people sometimes folks get caught trying to assume what the other is thinking based on their body and not themselves. Which affects how they behave and how the other person reacts. Which really is what micro-prejudice is in a nutshell.

But I think a person is too complicated to assume what is what and who thinks this or that. There are people out there who see anothers sex as a reason for things other than how they pee, but I'm glad to see it dwindle. At least in my experience. This is all stuff I notice change as I get older, there's no absolute survey or study into it beyond that.
 
Crazed man, to me at least, implies a person who acts aggressively violent towards anyone or causes direct harm to a person using physical violence. Of course me being schizophrenic I don't really assume people are aware of what ""crazy"" is actually like unless they are on the team or work in certain fields. The term ""Genuine insane"" even stirs up inaccurate images in my mind and I've experienced it.  But it's all relative and personal biased is unavoidable.

news,fnp86gc,t1_fnp38dv,1587140917.0,"I think the idea is to have a side by side ""look"" at what is essentially opposite ends of a bell curve. Rather than direct comparison. In this case being white women  known for having more lenient sentencing while black men having more harsh sentencing. 

Because these groups represent extremes in prejudice of the justice system, we are likely able to assume a cascading affect. That being, once convicted the likelihood of being re-convicted is higher vs once a life is made into adulthood without conviction the likelihood of being convicted later on is slimmer. 

So not a proper comparison but a glance on what could be and asking ourselves why isn't it and how to get there. After that is when we would want to work on individual variables and adjusting to work out any that would sway a sentence based on said variable or prejudice."

Also I hate to bring this up but anyone who compares romance and life in general to movies is in for a hell of a string of bad relationships down the road.

You don't even have to yell, just take a disappointed stance. 

Main thing though, ignore them for when they do dumb stuff and positive reinforce the good. Do your best not to anthropromorphize them. Good dog training based on their behavior and hierarchy system can seem copricious at times. Setting structure also helps keep them stable and happy.

You gotta remember that you're that dogs whole world. If you don't act like it they'll either jump ship or go full dictator and never feel satisfied."

Also Omaha hospitals are a little slow right now as all non essential procedures are put off to prepare for the worst scenario and minimize spread. Frankly I’d go with staff who aren’t coming off a stressful week. If it’s essential better do it sooner than later. If your doctors feel the risk out weighs the benefit I would assume (hope) they’d have canceled. Plus depending on the procedure you might get one or a couple of covid screens to make sure everything’s good on your end.

Like I'm me just hanging out with my cat or dog and suddenly just start hearing people talking about me from behind a wall. Which I mean, eh. Then it feels like there's something in the room that is just there. You don't know how you know it's there but it definitely is even though you really kinda know that it's not. Suddenly you start thinking about all the shit around you and how your day/week/year went and all these little miniscule things point at this ambiguous monstrosity just chilling in your room with yuh.

So I used to drink, jerk off, smoke, smoke like a ton to avoid that feeling. Now I just kinda accept it when it happens and assume whatever the hell is in/not in the room with me isn't really the monster and that I am.
