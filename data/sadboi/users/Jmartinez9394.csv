FreeFireBattlegrounds,f9pfitp,t1_f9peva1,1575533442.0,How the hell is it 50-50 when there are walls mines grenades bruh you don’t even know what your talking about. There are more factors to 1v1. If I’m low on health someone is rushing towards me I can put up a couple walls get behind the attacker and finish him off sooner cuz of greater damage and heal myself... I’m done arguing with a gold rank player goodbye.
FreeFireBattlegrounds,f9pedcj,t1_f7yi0e9,1575531888.0,Pain your a dumbass. It’s all about when you are surrounded in a battle with a bunch of people. If you have taken a bunch of damage and someone is coming up to you and you don’t have time to heal this is when hayatos ability comes in hand. You will do extra damages. After you’ve cleaned the area heal up. It works even better if you have aloks ability you can heal up and get the extra damage at the same time.
FreeFireBattlegrounds,f91q7fp,t3_e30ip5,1574997865.0,Damn noobs leave the game it’s okay. Learn how to use the guns and you will be fine. I make it to heroic every season with two gun skins. What’s your excuse. Also some of these aren’t hard to get. My wife just started an account and got the new ak with one ticket. Learn the mechanics and you will be fine. Also mines shouldn’t be too much of a problem if you check for them.
depression,f8c8ptz,t3_e00pxq,1574455042.0,"So I called in yesterday without giving a reason. I had told my boss 2 days ago that I wasn’t sure if I was depressed knowing damn well that I am. When I showed up after calling in she asked me if I had an appointment; thinking she needed a doctors note. Instead she asked me if I had an appointment with a therapist. She helped me find resources that I could use from my job. Now I have an appointment with a therapist and it’s fully covered. I hope it helps I’ve been calling out every two weeks because of my depression, every time fearing for my job. Don’t be afraid to tell your boss. You should know how understanding they are by the type of interactions you’ve had. If anything just call HR. They’ll do the best they can to accommodate."
