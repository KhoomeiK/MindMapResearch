It was the first time I’ve ever opened up my PC and started moving things around so I was anxious and excited. I was replacing my motherboard. Getting everything out was the ez part. Once I put the motherboard back in I watched some YouTube videos to help me put everything back together. I was pretty much finished. One of the last things to do was to insert my CPU on my motherboard, apply thermal paste, and lock it up. I pressed my CPU on my motherboard, and it didn’t line up properly. I continued to maneuver it, and once it was stuck on there I closed the lock and tried to boot my computer up. It didn’t boot up. I then went to this sub and asked what was wrong. I was given a plethora of questions, asking a variety of different questions. One person asked me about my CPU and motherboard. I told him it was a new MSI motherboard, and my CPU was an i5 2400...... Apparently the i5 is not comparable with my motherboard. After I answered him people thought it was very funny how I managed to get it on my motherboard considering how it wasn’t supposed to fit. So in the end I broke the pins in my cpu and motherboard, and had to buy another one. You

worldnews,fgu7qky,t1_fgtq7dz,1581114563.0,"To add on to what the other guy said, I’m pretty sure his name is based off of saint Francis of Assisi. He was born into a very wealthy family, and loved to drink the most expensive wine, and eat the most expensive food. He also liked to throw very big rich people parties. Eventually he went to war due to his hubris, and was taken as a prisoner of war. Once he was sent back to his town, he changed his ways. He sold everything he owned except for a tattered robe. He then studied the humility of Jesus, and learned to love every person he met. He would go out into the forest and pray for guidance and meditate. People say that when he would be meditating, the animals in the forest would watch him, and birds would even land and sit on his shoulders. He then started his journey of spreading the message of humility across the world, and eventually he had his own followers. To this day there are still priests who live by this way and they are called the Franciscans. I’ve met a couple and they are not even close to your typically white collar priest. A lot of them pursue music and ecological studies. But just like saint Francis they have very little possessions. They walk around with sandals, a brown robe, and a rope/belt. Saint Francis is easily one of my favorite saints. Even though I’m not too religious these days, I still try and follow in his footsteps in humility and minimalism. It’s hard, but they are some good morals to carry with you."

In laning you should be punishing your laners as much as possible for trying to CS or poke. Watch your minions hp and when it’s low your laner will prob try and go for it. Be sure to punish them. 

Now in silver elo, odds are your teammates won’t be paying attention to macro like drakes or incoming ganks. Jg matters so much for that reason in low elo because whoever gets more ganks usually wins the lane. But in this elo you can’t just rely on your jg. Instead shove your lane as Zoe once you get a kill in lane or ur laner backs and gank top or bottom. It will be unexpected and can put you and your teammates in the lead. 

So instead of actually 1v9ing as Zoe you really just got to help your teammates early so they don’t get crushed in team fights leaving you all alone and caught. I do this with all my mid laners and it tends to work out. 

I hoped this helped!"

greentext,f9v0pi3,t3_e72099,1575661084.0,I have hope for technology in 2020. It’s looking like there’s going to be some huge advancements in all of that future tech. Especially VR hentai.
nfl,f9t8qwu,t1_f9t8hnb,1575612786.0,"I wouldn’t say it was Nagy’s fault. However, Nagy’s offense mostly focuses on giving the ball to the RB and pocket passing, so the opportunity or plays like these are slim."
nfl,f9t4lii,t1_f9sz76x,1575608615.0,Him and Nagy have a complicated relationship. Nagy wants him to be more confident while forcing him to play in Nagys narrative. They both gotta learn to cooperate more. Plays like this though make me hopeful for the bears tho.
nfl,f9t4f16,t1_f9sysfj,1575608453.0,"I know right! Nagy hasn’t been allowing him to run at all, but hopefully seeing this will change his mind."
nfl,f9t4aym,t1_f9sz439,1575608350.0,"So we’re just going to forget the last couple games then? I’m glad Nagys finally letting him run the ball, but let’s not forget he’s been struggling this entire season."

Drugs,f9k51ky,t1_f9k4t24,1575392974.0,Hmm would chocolate milk fuck with the powder at all? I feel like the powder would have a hard time dissolving in it since it’s so thick and creamy and delicious.
