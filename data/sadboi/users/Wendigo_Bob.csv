40kLore,fp00rw4,t3_ga7dxk,1588200340.0,"Has this ever been described canonically? Unfortunately no. But I do believe there are some misconceptions about the warp that make this question a bit weird.

1. The warp does not “map out” onto the galaxy:

The warp is NOT like the nether in minecraft.  The warp has no area, no volume. There are no fixed points of reference (except maybe the astronomicon). It doesn’t even experience TIME in any way a material creature conceptualizes it. What defines the speed of warp-travel? Who knows. But we do know that travel speeds vary wildly, from years to days for the same physical distance.

2)  The warp isn’t material:

What the warp is is left open for obvious reason. But we do know the warp isn’t a physical space where matter is conserved; things constantly change, with no physical rime or reason, though some psykers (namely, some books about navigators & the thousand sons) perceive the warp as “conceptual”; hills of fear, oceans of joy that are relatively “fixed” within the warp unlike the ever-shifting matter that could be seen through normal eyes.

3)  Do daemons use the materium to travel? Yes (I think), within certain constraints.

One question is why daemons enter the materium at all to harm specific people. After all, possession is a thing, souls can be attacked from the warp when they are found. I propose (and this is a headcannon, but I think it works) that the warp “distance” is conceptual, NOT physical. IE, while two concepts (or souls) may have considerable conceptual distance in the warp, they may be close together in the materium. So a Daemon might go through someone (lets say a sorcerer) to get to the soul of an enemy (lets say a space marine) which they could not conceptually reach in the warp. Its not quite travel, but I do believe its an essential perspective to consider relation between the warp & materium.

Anyways, that’s my perspective. I’ve developed this idea more, but that’s a whole other can of worms."
40kLore,fo8vrkt,t1_fo7lewp,1587604865.0,"Exactly! Its part of the reason why I think religion wasnt something he hated-but feared, both for the consequences to himself but to humanity as a whole. Its in part of something weird I'm working on (I call it conceptual dynamics; its an attempt to create a logically consistent (if not entirely predictable) system of physics for magic, part of it is ""Theophysics"" which would address what I think is happening to the emperor, anyways, its a worldbuilding challenge for me). In any case, its fun to find other people who think like me."
40kLore,fo3k7i5,t3_g4wxxl,1587488280.0,"TLDR: Really glad I'm not the only one to think the bigE was terrified about becoming a god.

I have a very similar head-cannon, primarily centered around the notion that the bigE was terrified at the notion of becoming a god. Ok, so there are a few central ideas seperate from what you stated:

1) Souls are capable of ""ascending"" into the warp. This is most obvious with daemons born of mortals; it is interesting to note however that they all seem to become caricatures of themselves, seeming to lose flexibility and becoming an exageration of their personality.

2) I posit that the term ""god"" refers to any such warp entity of a given magnitude that they start to change the warp.

3) The warp and materium are seperate; a warp-mass of sufficent ""mass"" to be considered a god could not be sustained in the materium. (Supported in part by the gods never acting themselves, and even daemons having a hard time staying active for long)

4) The eldar gods are ascended old ones (lore inconsistently supports this), and their process of ascencion is what the bigE is trying to avoid.

Ok, so here is what I think happened to (many of) the old ones:

The old ones either made the eldar or ""re-made"" another species into the eldar. This created a bond between them, with the eldar very much perceiving the old ones as gods, or god-like. This collective belief accreted over time, around the souls of the old ones, making them bigger and eventually ""forcing"" them into the warp (as their souls where too massive for the materium), creating the first warp-gods.

I believe the same thing is happening currently to the emperor. The ""Eldritch"" as you propose is not a seperate entity, but the emperor's own soul, grown bloated & massive, constrained by the limits of the warp to slowly sap away his self and turn him into a caricature. The ""Eldritch"" is a god-head; a god in becoming, fed by thousands of sacrificed souls and by the boundless belief in humanity.

Now, why do I think this would terrify the bigE? Well, first it would go completely against his main objective; if humanity simply fell back on a new god, they would still be slaves to the warp. And second (and I believe most important), he would be annihilated, and his purpose with him; whatever god remained would not be the bigE, but a caricature of him; a monster feeding of the very thing he wanted to protect, to free-mankind. He would not be their protector, but a vast parasite; a vampire as you said.

Anyways, I'd love to do something more complete with this, but I'm mostly glad to learn I'm not the only one to think this way. If you ever want to collaborate on something along these lines, I would be glad to. I did most of this as some (very weird) prep-work for a 40k rpg and I love this kind of world-building."

The creatures of the warp are made of concepts, not matter; so things and events that are conceptually charged affect them more strongly (for example, blades & fire) even if other things would have more effect on something strictly material. My own about the big E's power is that he understands that better than anyone; while ""mundane"" psykers rely on fetishes, symbolism and artifacts to suggest concepts, the big E is able to perfectly conceptualize such concepts (IE, he doesnt need help).

If you do want an interesting approach to ""advancing the story"", there is a decent fanfic called ""The shape of the nightmare to come-50k"" which does go far into developing the place & role of even the xenos factions, and shows the imperium fracturing in an interesting and meaningfull way."
40kLore,f4j8vbd,t1_f4ir13e,1571615052.0,"Yeah, I prefer a stable storyline myself; a setting, more than a narrative. I honestly thought they where going in the smart direction when they did the whole ""Beast arises"" series, looking into other interesting periods in imperial history, but no...

All in all, I think advancing the storyline was a mistake, in large part because they cant fix their endpoint; they have to dance until they are told to stop, regardless of its narrative sense. The imperium will keep struggling, nothing significant will change, or if it does the effect will only be significant to those parts of the setting we DONT see.

The best way I could have seen it going would be to further details the age of imperium (like beast arises & babab war) until things stopped being profitable, then dump on us some ""the end"" shizzle that concludes things. Now they have to work forwards, and we can only hope they stop dancing at at interesting point. But honestly, I'm not sure how commercially viable such a practice is; GW aint the only game in town anymore, and maybe this is a desperate attempt to remain relevant by appearing dynamic.

As I run things, I keep it in the age of imperium on focus on exploring that. I already know there is only one ending that would allow the imperium to have a small ""win"", still be incredibly grimdark, while keeping to the overarching theme of spiting the dying of the light.

Though honestly I'm surprised they even bother keeping around these minor factions; clearly the SM are much more profitable to them, so why put the effort? They probably are still profitable, just not enough  for them to care; kinda like how video game companies are only ""satisfied"" when they make obscene profits, while the other genres they ignore would merely make absurd profits.

At this point honestly, just find something you have fun with and dont expect much. Eventually, this will stop being profitable and they will end it. I focus on the lore & the FFG RPGs myself, so nothing exists past the end times to me."
40kLore,f4igcn5,t3_dk8okq,1571603702.0,"The whole business limitations are always a shot in the foot for any attempt at serious, overarching narrative. Its clear that they dont want to set a destination; an ""end""; so its very difficult to create an interesting journey. If there is a defined end, its probably been long-decided, and will appear suddenly and disappointingly. Kinda like How I met your Mother; the ending was clearly filmed in season 1, to be tacked on to whatever was happening when they finally got cancelled. In fact, I feel like warhammer fantasy ended like that as well; I get the impression it just ""ended"". The ending will always dissapoint, because they never where building towards it.

I have heard however that the decision-making at GW is very commercial-first (such as the figures/vehicles being designed by sculptors first, with the fluff having to come after they are complete). I really dont get the impression that the writers have any real authority to influence the overarching plot; they're likely just there to fill in the blanks with their stories. (If someone from GW is willing to correct me, I would love to know how it genuinely works).

As for xenos, I'm afraid they may kinda be a weird, self-fulfilling prophecy. Xenos aint popular, so GW puts less effort, less narrative, less marketing, and therefore attracts nobody new. The cycle repeats.

Still, while the eldar never win, but they never fully lose either. They're kept in a weird, sucky stasis that goes nowhere truly good nor bad."
40kLore,f2m39sw,t3_ddr89g,1570301059.0,"***The Chapter itself***

The following chapter describes elements of the chapter itself, including clan-companies, heroes and relics.

**Best-known Clan-Companies:**

*Clan Yalisos:* responsible for defending Skaros Primus, Clan Yalisos was the first clan-company, recruiting exclusively from the Skaros system. It's choir-master, also known as Precentor, leads the whole chapter. It's members are considered to be the closest to the Omnissiah, an example that all Astartes of the chapter should follow. They frequently deploy squads alongside other clans, as the relative safety of the Skaros system leaves them with few local combat opportunities.

*Clan Voidwalker:* responsible for maintaining the fleet of the Chapter, clan voidwalker are considered masters of space combat, with many among them being master pilots, gunners and 3d-tacticians. This clan has a much greater number of mortal retainers involved in high-level tactical decisions, as there are not enough Astartes among them to lead all vessels. This has led to great respect for them in the Imperial Navy, as they are among the few who will defer to mortal expertise when involved in tactical action with them. They exclusively recruit from the sector's numerous Forge-fleets, large mechanicus fleets that pounce on unsettled systems and strip all valuable resources from them.

*Clan Dominus:* responsible for maintaining the chapter Cybernetica Auxiliary, these marines are trained to fight alongside all imperial combat robots, from the Artalax to the Vultarax. They typically travel alongside Clan Voidwalker, ready to assist them in cleansing any impurity they might find on their expeditions. They recruit from a number of forge-worlds, favoring candidates known for their natural affinity at working alongside machines. The location of their Clan-fortress is unknown to the larger public, though it is believed to be hidden under one of the forge-hives of Hexeldrane.

*Clan Diamondskin:* Fortress-holders of the chapter, the clan arose following the second calisotan crusade. Their role was to establish and maintain a chain of fortress-worlds to keep the heart of the sector safe. As the 3rd calisotan crusade ended, they have moved their efforts to the edge of the sector. They have been working intensily to reinforce the ultralimbus sub-sector, and have reinforced the star-fortresses at the 4 gates.

*Clan Quicksilver:* Cyber-masters who'se skills go beyond those of even the Ordo Vanus, Clan quicksilver is responsible for protecting the chapter's data and maintaining data-integrity of the sector. They are fewer than most other clan-companies, and are said to recruit only from the most tech-capable aprentices of the administratum, and any other dedicated to pure knowledge.

*Banisher Clan:* Founded during the campaign to recover the Argent Questor from the space hulk Darkstep. The campaign was fought in constant opposition to the dark mechanicus and their vast armies of daemon engines.  For that reason, a clan was founded specifically to purify corrupted machines. They have since become one of the most celebrated clans for their skill at fighting corrupted machines. It is said their techinques inspired Magos Eremor to create the Techsorcist discipline.
 
**Chapter Relics:**

*Argent Panoply:* found in a lost stasis-vault of Skaros Primus by the Iron Hands Captain Salukan Garsaak, it's sheer majesty made the weathered techmarine weep and inspired the name of the chapter. This Archeotech  Artificer Armor set had the exact proportions for a space marine, leading many to believe it had been created by the Omnissiah himself during the Dark Age, in preparation for those to come. The intial find contained three items, with cryptic clues on where to find more hidden in the Skaros system. Many legends surround the panoply, with some believing the silver of the armor is the same as that in the hands of Ferrus Manus, and that once the whole panoply was assembled he would return to his children. Others, students of history, are more suspicious, as no astartes-proportioned armor had ever been found, before or since, dating from the dark ages .

It has been the chapter's most hallowed artifact since, worn only by their greatest champions, and always as a set. None have ever fallen while wearing it. It is said it said to be proof against the power of the warp, with psychic attacks flowing off it, and daemons melting away at its touch.

*The True-argent Halo:* One of the first 3, this silver-colored archeotech force-field generator is of the highest workmaship, far beyond the ability of most.

*The Argent Helm:* One of the first 3, this archeotech helmet is filled with arcane sense-amplifiers, a powerful vox-array and a masterwork auspex integrated within.

*The Argent Plate:* One of the first 3, this archeotech artificer power armor is exceptional in every way, protecting better than terminator plate while allowing a deftness that makes all others seem clumsy in comparison.

*The Antithesis of Existence:* Discovered before even the armor by an Archmagos Reductor, he gifted this ancient conversion beamer to the newly founded chapter once he saw the similarities.

*The Mithral Bulwark:* An archeotech storm-shield of shining silver, it is taller than most men and seems to amplify the protective power of the True-argent halo. It was discovered on Skaros Leuctra, when one of the Mechanical Techtonic Plates that rose to the surface showed certains signs that matched one of the clues. They quickly mounted an expedition, though despite their dedication they only found it once the Tectonic plate had started returning to the depths, and most of the clan-company was lost.

*The hands of the omnissiah:* An archeotech servo-harness equipped with 14 mechadendrites of various narcane natures, it's machine spirits are said to be so advanced they react to the slightest thought. Found deep in the caves of the moon Skaros Bedriacum, it was found immaculate, while every other surface was covered in the invasive (and nutritious) fungal specimens of this vast agri-mine.

*Those still sought*: it is unclear how many parts of the Argent Panoply are left to find, though current analysis indicates that there should be a power sword, an inferno pistol, and at least 3 other (currently unidentified) objects. 


*Argent Questor, ark Mechanicus:* Flagship of the Argent Ultima fleet and fortress-monastery of the Voidwalkers Clan-company, this vessel has has seen all corners of the sector. This vessel was originally recovered from a space-hulk that appeared at the border of the sector from the Cypran passage. Its argent hull and glorious countenance was all that was needed to convince the chapter of its value. It has since served faithfully, with each successive generation of choir-masters uncovering more of the secrets inside this masterwork of the machine-god."
40kLore,f2m2hxj,t3_ddr89g,1570300896.0,"**Chapter Philosophy**

*The history of the founder*

The chapter Philosophy would always be influenced by the teachings of the Iron Father Zenodeon and the Cult Mechanicus.

Iron Father Zenodeon was an apprentice Techmarine on Mars in the beginnings of the Horus Heresy, during the Death of Innocence and the Schism of Mars. He, alongside a 17 of his fellow apprenta, one from each legion, formed a small group called the Brotherhood of the Cog. Following the Death of Innocence, these apprentice techmarines ranged all over Mars, trying to recover as much knowledge, and as many loyal adepts as was possible. To express their dedication to the machine-god and the omnissiah stripped their armor of all coloring, keeping only their techmarine pauldron as an identifier. During the nine years of the heresy, the brotherhood waged a constant guerilla war against the forces of Kelbor-hal. As all this occurred during the events at Istvaan 5, Zenodeon was not hit as strongly by the death of Ferrus Manus. Him and his fellow techmarines formed a strong bond beyond even the bonds of their legions. When mars was freed, only those nine brotherhood members from the loyal legions returned, the fate of their ""traitor"" brothers kept silent (though some rumors claimed that these ""loyalist traitors"" where sheltered, eventually to join in secret the argent ultima). This, combined with his experience during the death of innocence, led to a greater than normal closeness to the teachings of the Cult Mechanicus, as well as a greater appreciation for the expansion of knowledge.

In the years following the heresy, Zenodeon became convinced that what doomed his primarch was not the weakness of the flesh, but the same one that led to the undoing of the Mechanicum: pride. As the mechanicum came to believe that they were gods, the machines, and so had Ferrus Manus, charging forth to face his brother alone. As the Adeptus Mechanicus was born of needed humility towards the machine (Mere adepts, and not the machine itself), Zenodeon espoused a way of humility, respect, and self-effacement. It was the weaknesses of the mind that needed to be guarded against, and not those of the flesh.
This philosophy did not appeal to his legion, filled with hatred of their foes and self-pity towards the weakness of their flesh. He attracted a few followers, but never held major influence. The foundation of a chapter following his ideals allowed him to expand them greatly.

*The influence of the sector:*

The Calisota sector has a number of unique features that influenced Zenodeon and his successors. A strange feature of individuals born in the sector, some seem to perceive the presence of machines as a vast choir, unequal in harmony and melody. While this was imperceptible to Zenodeon at first, many of his recruits and local tech-priests described it to him. Over time, he managed to hear the choir himself, which shook him almost as deeply as the Argent Panoply. Few but the greatest of Archmagos had ever claimed to hear such a choir, yet in this sector so many seemed open to it. Before the proper starting of chapter operations, he organized them according to a special method based on the choir and the wisdom of those who came before.
The heart of the sector is also powerfully warp-suppressive. Navigators frequently mention that the warp is unusually predictable within the sector; and no documented case of a psyker born in the sector’s heart has ever been registered. As the argent ultima recruits exclusively from the sector’s heart, none of their recruits present the skills to become librarians; as such, the chapter maintains none.

*The Precepts of Zenodeon:*

>**The Purity of Argent:** The lesson to learn from the hands of Ferrus Manus was not their iron, but the purity of their silver, and the dependance they induced in Ferrus Manus. It is more important to retain the purity gifted by the Omnissiah than to replace it with the works of man.

>**The Pre-Eminence of Flesh:** One must remember that the Omnissiah gifted them with a body of flesh, not of steel, and it should not be replaced lightly.

>**The Argent Mind:** To the Astartes of the Argent Ultima, they must free themselves from the idea-forms that might lead them to weakness of mind. The astartes must avoid Pride, Wrath, Fallacious Argumentation, Optimism, Pessimism, Impatience, and a great many more faults.

>**Humility facing the machine:** The machine, glorious creation of humanity, must be treated with respect and humility. No man must ever presume that they can know all of a machine. The machine is their ally, and not a tool or slave.

>**Striving against imperfection:** The astartes must forever seek self-improvement, both in mind and body. One must accept criticism, evaluate it honestly, and establish its validity.

>**Duty above glory**: the pursuit of glory should be struck down. The acts of an astartes shall only be glorified after death or retirement, lest they encourage a distorted image of self.

**The way of the Choir (Chapter organization):**

The chapter perceives the codex astartes as a decent tactical text, but hold it in only slightly higher regard than others. They have diverged even further from their progenitors over its last 9 millennia on the fringe of the galaxy. 

This includes organization as specialized clan-companies. Each Chorus (clan-company) is divided into a series of Choirs (platoons), divided according to codex standard; 1 veteran choir, 4 battle choirs, 4 reserves choirs & 2 scout choirs. As they are always separated over multiple battle-zones, this allows each clan-company to function as an individual unit. This is allowed in part due to their extensive auxiliaries; each clan-company has thousands of battle-servitors (some say made from the bodies of failed neophytes), allowing the astartes to act only where most needed.

**Chapter Non-standard terms**

The following non-standard terms are used:

*Precentor:* Leader of the choir, equivalent to chapter-master

*Chorus*: Clan-company

*Choir Master*: Captain

*Choir*: Platoon, composed of 2-3 squads

*Choir Leader*: Techmarine, combined roles of techmarine and chaplain

*Chorist*: Standard Tactical Marine

*Soloist*: Assault-marine/astartes specializing in single combat

*Crescendo*: Heavy weapon marines, devastator equivalent

*Treble Choir*: Scout company equivalent, novice space marines

*Requiem*: Elite terminator squads found in each Chorus

*Mithral Giant*: Elite terminator soloists

**Divergent elements**

Unlike most chapters, the Argent Ultima has no librarians. The Choir-leaders fulfill the record-keeping tasks librarians would normally perform.

The chapter also does not field any Dreadnoughts, claiming that dying Astartes deserve the peace of the grave, and that their mental decay it leads to makes it impossible to follow the precepts of Zenodeon. 

**Training and eduction**

The Argent Ultima typically recruit from a number of forge-worlds, death-worlds and void-fleets. Part of the training involves each member participating in the fabrication of their power-armor, becoming intimately aware of its machine spirit.

Due to their close ties with the Relic-World of Skaros Primus, their chapter’s Techmarines are trained there rather than Mars. Due to their wider roles within the chapter, these techmarine neophytes spend 48 years (4 years per division) learning from magos of the various specialties. As such, the chapter’s Techmarines are often less augmented than their peers, to not lose awareness of the machines of flesh & mind."

I dont know if you are interested, but my homebrew chapter is built around some of the elements adressed in the quote.

I've actually got a whole document written up, but its too much to put here. Here's a small summary:

**Argent Ultima (The last of silver)**

The founder was named Zenodeon; unlike his brothers, he was on Mars during the Death of innocence/schism of mars, and tried to save as much as possible. He didnt directly experience the Trauma of Ferrus' death, and believed that if the omnissiah had given them flesh-bodies that the flesh was clearly first.

**Philosophy **

-*It is more important to retain the purity gifted by the Omnissiah than to replace it with the works of man*

-Focus on weaknesses of the mind (Pride, wrath, optimism, pessimism, fallacious arguments, etc.)

-Emotions are normal, but to allow them to dominate us is flawed

-Striving against imperfection; *The astartes must forever seek self-improvement, both in mind and body. One must accept criticism, evaluate it honestly, and establish its validity.*

This warp-storm became the ""eastern"" edge of the cicatrix maledictum. The fortress had a ton of unsolved mysteries, such as:

-*The omega vault*: A mysterious vault that periodically released relics, archeotech, and even people, often in time of greatest need. It was apparently almost empty, and some feared what catastrophy would necessitate the opening of the last vaults...

-*The dark pattern*: Supposedly a series of portents followed by the imperium and the eldar. Most assumed that it was related to necron awakening, but a few thought it was linked with the apparently-expanding hadex anomaly.

40kLore,ezx8isk,t3_d2tig6,1568234463.0,"**Introduction**

The Argent Ultima are a space marine chapter of the 3rd founding that has loyally served the imperium since. Founded of Iron Hands stock, it was created to protect the Calisota sector, an isolated region in northern segmentum obscurus. The following document describes their history, their speciality, their organization and their philosophy. 

**Chapter History**

*Pre-founding*

In the waning years of the 31st millennium in the distant Calisota sector, the Archmagos of the Relic-World of Skaros where facing increasing threats related to Orkish and Chaotic forces. It’s location at the edge of the sector left it open to frequent raids. Hearing of the 3rd founding being organized by Rogal Dorn, they petitioned the High Lords of terra to have one of the chapters established within their borders.

Due to the closeness of the Iron Hands to the mechanicus, an elderly Iron Father by the name of Zenodeon was sent to Skaros to evaluate its need. Zenodeon had long wanted to visit Skaros, as the Relic-world, entirely artificial and dating from the dark age of technology, was renowned as a masterwork of the Omnissiah. In adition, the forge-world had been left untouched by the schism of mars, allowing it to maintain much of the earlier age of the mechanicum.

Zenodeon was deeply impressed by the Relic-world; from surface to core, its nature showed the work of human hands. The local machine cult claimed it was the glorious nature of the world that made the Omnissiah impossible to ignore; for only a being of perfect knowledge could have created it. Deep in the unexplored vaults of the world, an archeotech wonder was discovered by a team of technoarcheologists. Seeing a sign of destiny, they invited the Iron father to see their glorious discovery.

There, in a deep stasis-vault, Iron Father Zenodeon was moved to tears. In the chamber was a wondrous set of artificer power armor, of greater quality and wondrousness than ever before. Its skin was of purest argent, its faceplate a smooth curve, all topped by a silver halo. In addition, the armor was perfectly sized to fit an Astartes, despite having been in the vault for thousands of years. These sign where simply too great for Zenodeon to believe this was a coincidence. He declared that the armor, now named the Argent Panoply, was created by the Omnissiah himself, in ages past, for those Astartes that would reach this world. A chapter MUST be founded he claimed, to protect both the Relic-World and this wondrous Artifact.

*Founding:*

As founder, Zenodeon had an inordinate impact on the Chapter philosophy, based on his experience as a young techmarine during the Horus Heresy. Rather than decry the weakness of the flesh as their progenitors, they decried those of the mind and personality. In addition, they followed the beliefs of the Cult Mechanicus in its entirety, placing little importance on their Primarch and honoring the trinity of the Omnissiah (creator of the flesh), the machine-god (creator of the mind) and the motive force (creator of the soul). Founded as guardians of the sector, they were tasked with defending it and it alone.


**Chapter Philosophy**
*The history of the founder*

The chapter Philosophy would always be influenced by the teachings of the Iron Father Zenodeon and the Cult Mechanicus.

Iron Father Zenodeon was an apprentice Techmarine on Mars in the beginnings of the Horus Heresy, during the Death of Innocence and the Schism of Mars. He, alongside a 17 of his fellow apprenta, one from each legion, formed a small group called the Brotherhood of the Cog. Following the Death of Innocence, these apprentice techmarines ranged all over Mars, trying to recover as much knowledge, and as many loyal adepts as was possible. To express their dedication to the machine-god and the omnissiah stripped their armor of all coloring, keeping only their techmarine pauldron as an identifier. During the nine years of the heresy, the brotherhood waged a constant guerilla war against the forces of Kelbor-hal. As all this occurred during the events at Istvaan 5, Zenodeon was not hit as strongly by the death of Ferrus Manus. 

Him and his fellow techmarines formed a strong bond beyond even the bonds of their legion. When mars was freed, only those nine brotherhood members from the loyal legions returned, the fate of their ""traitor"" brothers kept silent (though some rumors claimed that these ""loyalist traitors"" where sheltered, eventually to join in secret the argent ultima). This, combined with his experience during the death of innocence, led to a greater than normal closeness to the teachings of the Cult Mechanicus, as well as a greater appreciation for the expansion of knowledge.

In the years following the heresy, Zenodeon became convinced that what doomed his primarch was not the weakness of the flesh, but the same one that led to the undoing of the Mechanicum: pride. As the mechanicum came to believe that they were gods, the machines, and so had Ferrus Manus, charging forth to face his brother alone. As the Adeptus Mechanicus was born of needed humility towards the machine (Mere adepts, and not the machine itself), Zenodeon espoused a way of humility, respect, and self-effacement. It was the weaknesses of the mind that needed to be guarded against, and not those of the flesh.

This philosophy did not appeal to his legion, filled with hatred of their foes and self-pity towards the weakness of their flesh. He attracted a few followers, but never held major influence. The foundation of a chapter following his ideals allowed him to expand them greatly.

*The Precepts of Zenodeon:*

**The Purity of Argent:** The lesson to learn from the hands of Ferrus Manus was not their iron, but the purity of their silver. It is more important to retain the purity gifted by the Omnissiah than to replace it with the works of man.

**The Pre-Eminence of Flesh:** One must remember that the Omnissiah gifted them with a body of flesh, not of steel, and it should not be replaced lightly.

**The Argent Mind:** To the Astartes of the Argent Ultima, they must free themselves from the idea-forms that might lead them to weakness of mind. The astartes must avoid Pride, Wrath, Fallacious Argumentation, Optimism, Pessimism, Impatience, and a great many more faults.

**Humility facing the machine**: The machine, glorious creation of humanity, must be treated with respect and humility. No man must ever presume that they can know all of a machine. The machine is their ally, and not a tool or slave.

**Striving against imperfection:** The astartes must forever seek self-improvement, both in mind and body. One must accept criticism, evaluate it honestly, and establish its validity.

**Duty above glory**: the pursuit of glory should be struck down. The acts of an astartes shall only be glorified after death or retirement, lest they encourage a distorted image of self.

*The way of the Choir (Chapter organization):*

The chapter perceives the codex astartes as a decent tactical text, but hold it in only slightly higher regard than others. They have diverged even further from their progenitors over its last 9 millennia on the fringe of the galaxy.

This includes organization as specialized clan-companies. Each Chorus (clan-company) is divided into a series of Choirs (platoons), divided according to codex standard; 1 veteran choir, 4 battle choirs, 4 reserves choirs & 2 scout choirs. As they are always separated over multiple battle-zones, this allows each clan-company to function as an individual unit. This is allowed in part due to their extensive auxiliaries; each clan-company has thousands of battle-servitors (some say made from the bodies of failed neophytes), allowing the astartes to act only where most needed.

**Chapter Non-standard terms**

The following non-standard terms are used:

Precentor: Leader of the choir, equivalent to chapter-master

Chorus: Clan-company

Choir Master: Captain

Choir: Platoon, composed of 2-3 squads

Choir Leader: Techmarine, combined roles of techmarine and chaplain

Chorist: Standard Tactical Marine

Soloist: Assault-marine/astartes specializing in single combat

Crescendo: Heavy weapon marines, devastator equivalent

Treble Choir: Scout company equivalent, novice space marines

Requiem: Elite terminator squads found in each Chorus

Mithral Giant: Elite terminator soloists

**Divergent elements**

Unlike most chapters, the Argent Ultima has no librarians. The Choir-leaders fulfill the record-keeping tasks librarians would normally perform.

The chapter also does not field any Dreadnoughts, claiming that dying Astartes deserve the peace of the grave, and that their mental decay it leads to makes it impossible to follow the precepts of Zenodeon.

**Training and eduction**

The Argent Ultima typically recruit from a number of forge-worlds, death-worlds and void-fleets. Part of the training involves each member participating in the fabrication of their power-armor, becoming intimately aware of its machine spirit.

Due to their close ties with the Relic-World of Skaros Primus, their chapter’s Techmarines are trained there rather than Mars. Due to their wider roles within the chapter, these techmarine neophytes spend 48 years (4 years per division) learning from magos of the various specialties. As such, the chapter’s Techmarines are often less augmented than their peers, to not lose awareness of the machines of flesh & mind.

40kLore,ez48vng,t1_ez3oyje,1567683063.0,"I have a theory about this: namely, that the timetable was WAY off for everyone, namely because chaos was a lot more ""organized"" than anyone thought. To support:

-In legion, John Gramaticus is surprised Horus is already warmaster, and seems to think there would still be years.

-In fulgrim, Eldrad is also surprised, believing there is still time to act before chaos becomes involved.

40kLore,ez14shi,t3_czre9m,1567645124.0,"Hektor Varvarus acted appropriately. I believe this also shows one of the greatest weaknesses of the imperium in general & the astartes in particular: poor ethical & philosophical education. Those early books demonstrate it very well.

The imperial truth wanted itself to be rationalistic, but the reactions of average humans (namely, beating up one of the remembrancers trying to understand a conquered people) show that their education was imposed: they where not taught to be rational, but taught to blindly accept the notions of the ideology. Its not terribly surprising, seeing as actual expanded rationalism may have made the ""lie"" of the imperial truth more apparent; nonetheless, the way it was applied virtually assured that it would reproduce the worst excesses of the religions the emperor wanted to destroy.

In retrospect, I quite like these early books, because they both show the ""idealism"" that underpinned the great crusade, while also showing the faultlines underlying the ideal. The focus on quick expansion over integration, of forceful compliance, of imposing the imperial truth rather than educating people towards it all ensured that the dreams of the great crusade would fail."

They also enforce craft, making sure every aspirant participates in the construction of their armor & weapons, so as to be intimately familiar with their machine-spirits from birth. And they obsessively collect archeotech. 

I made them third founding, so they have 9k years of putting heroes in stasis, collecting archeotech, and making new weapons & armor, meaning they could likely equip a legion even if they couldnt field the troops."

-Armaggedon (AKA Ullanor) is a Necron tomb world holding a weapon of such absurd desctructive power that the Orcs felt the need to camp it for 60 million years, and are now programmed to return eternally to it.

**The conquest of Ralthen (Great crusade/horus heresy):**

When the technologically advanced non-imperial world of Ralthen refuses to join the imperium peacefully, an expeditionary force led by the XVIth legion is sent to force compliance. The Rogue Trader Praeparcus Filianatis, desiring the riches of this advanced world and wanting to enhance his own domain, puts into action an intricate plan to conquer it before the great crusade even arrives.

**Dramatis Personae**

*Rogue Trader Praeparcus Filianatis* : Claimed by some to be the first Rogue Trader, this once-quartermaster of the unification wars plunged with wild abandon into the great crusade. For centuries, he has charged forth into the unknown. His daring, ruthlessness and manipulative nature allowed him to lead his men into challenges none would have thought feasible. Despite all he has accomplished, he is never satisfied by his conquests, always seeking new horizons to discover, more secrets to uncover and more wealth to loot!

*Magos Hezbrix of Voss:* One who always skirts the border of tech-heresy, Hezbrix joined Filianatis both to escape his persecutors and to face the unknown. A creature of cold, towering intellect, he is constantly pursuing the quest for knowledge. His skill at developing unorthodox solutions has given him the ear of the rogue trader, giving him significant influence over their objectives.

*Psyker Glenda of Salzanir*: This once-shaman saved Filianatis’ life on the feral world of Salzanir. A relaxed and level-headed individual, she believes that there is a need to save the Rogue Trader from his own nearly self-destructive daring. An experienced (and now sanctioned) psyker, she has grown closer to Filianatis due to their shared love of arcane knowledge. When caution is thrown to the wind, she ensures there are safeguards and plans for as many surprises as possible.

*Zalda Tzemopoulos:* Having served with Filianatis since his first forays into the unknown, Zalda is a peerless navigator. Despite the mutations of her kind, she has often been the most human of Filianatis’ eclectic and bizarre command staff. 

*Arch-Militant Helios the Outlander*: Once a celebrated military leader in a pre-imperial human civilization, he was reluctantly saved by Filianatis before the great crusade exterminated his people. He is now the twisted shell of a man, torn between those lost and those saved who followed him into service to the rogue trader. Nonetheless, he is an exceptional warrior, a giant of a man capable for whom violence is an escape from his haunting past."

There are also more specific predictions, such as the ""Dark Pattern"" perceived by the deathwatch Dead Cabal in the Jericho Reach. While they thought it was necron-related, a few thought it was chaos related, and considering the Jericho Reach's main warp storm (the hadex anomaly) is now the easternmost limit of the cicatrix maledictum, you could say things where being prepared for.

-On a recruiting run in a deep hive, they where ambushed; they then got saved by a large force of local arbites, leading to a life debt by the chapter-master towards them.

-Over the years, the chapter keeps close ties with the arbites, occasionally assisting them in high-risk anti-criminal organisations (galactic criminal syndicates, renegade mercenary fleets, cold traders, etc.)

-With these close ties, they start recruiting from long-running Arbites families.

-This slowly influences the chapter culture, putting the Book of Judgment in a near-sacred position.

-As time passes, they become a high-power counter-intelligence chapter.

-Develop a particular enmity against the Alpha Legion, playing a complex game of cat & mouse with them over the entire galaxy.
