SuicideWatch,flchi0u,t1_flcgx1x,1585031057.0,"I felt the same way. I told myself every day, enjoy highschool while you can because you will probably kill yourself before you can get to college. You know how I convinced myself to stop worrying? I told myself, enjoy the summer while you can and just kill yourself before college starts. But time just went on and I didnt. The next summer I did the same thing. Life just keeps moving. You will have good days that will convince you it was all worth it for this one moment. The memories of the shit you went through will fade. I can barely remember why I wanted to kill myself, it all seems so insignificant. I'm feeling it again, but I'm hanging in there till I can reach the other side again because I know eventually I will. One day you can look back at who you were and realize that person is gone. In a way my past self did die, I dont remember being him because new experiences pushed out the bad memories. Try to hang on for your future self, because she will really appreciate that you allowed her to exist. If you arent feeling it yet, then you havnt gotten there yet. I look back at my past self and I feel bad for him, but I'm glad he didnt go through with it."

thelastofus,fh2r30x,t1_fh2jih6,1581259741.0,Kill em. Strangle the first infected in front of you. That part is always easy. First infected on the left hall will walk into a room. Follow him in and strangle him. Leave and hide down the hall on your left as you exit on the left most wall. Wait and another infected will walk out in the opening near you. Strangle him when he turns away and return to your spot. The guard infected will come out near the same area. Strangle him too as soon as he turns away. Now you just got the clicker left. Chuck a bottle at him and beat em whit your stick. Done deal.
thelastofus,fh1zkuq,t1_fh1xatr,1581229184.0,"Ammo is really rare, but if you play right you dont really need much of it. The game will never leave you without ammo if it is absolutely needed. The hut wasn't hard at all. Just shoot infected before they even approach the window. Spend all your rifle shots on the first three infected. Make sure you dont have any left. If you do this david will give you five bullets. Idk but it lets you continue game plus after you finish a game."
thelastofus,fh1o5d4,t1_fh1nqzl,1581219402.0,For that part I used two arrows on the clicker. You can use one in the head but the fucker moves. I strangled the runner on the left. After that I used one arrow for the guy down the hall. Dont walk to him or you will trigger the 3 infected coming from the room. I threw a bomb in the door inside the room and blew up 3 infected. 3 more infected will come from down the next hall. I used another bomb. Pretty much you need bombs if you wanna save ammo in this part. I had 2 shotgun rounds when I went inside the gym and a molotov of course. I always make sure to have one for this part. You are ducked without a molotov.
thelastofus,fh1n4ll,t1_fh1mpjo,1581218607.0,Well I'm assuming you lost most of your ammo I  the area with the school buses? I just went on top of a bus and held off infected with melee. Joel kicks em off as a final attack.

thelastofus,fgmqzic,t1_fgmfxrb,1580930273.0,"Bro that part with sam doesnt have to be hard. I ran to the exit and that was that. Here is a tip, molotovs basically act as a fire trap, throw one near the ground and any infected that walk over it will get burned. I have lured over 6 infected to a trapped to kill them all. Comes useful in the hallways when you get the flamethrower. Also very useful in the hospital where they all bunch up. Avoid  any fight you can avoid. The AI is still stupid as usual, and you can walk by most of them as long as they arent directly on front of you. Once you hit the exit animation your good"
