My parents tried intervening early and getting me on medication, thing is, whenever you're talking about altering the brains chemistry everything's up in the air, something a little different happens to everyone, first time I took meds, they removed my anxiety, heightened my depression, first time I tried to kill myself, never took them again and swore against them. I also grew distant with my brother during adolescence, viewing them in the same manner as Bella. 

I don't necessarily have much advice, as I am still sort of recovering, but don't let it get to the point where I was, where I had to be forcibly administered to a hospital (was there for 2 weeks) and am now on meds that work for me, depression is a complicated topic, and functions differently for everybody, I wish you the best, I can ask my mom for more info on how she felt about it if you want to, just know she isn't alone and there are a lot of people who go through the same thing.
