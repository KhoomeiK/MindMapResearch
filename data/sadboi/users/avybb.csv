unpopularopinion,fm9v1tm,t3_ftt936,1585877215.0,"I think the biggest part of this is that people arent taught specifically about emotion. Basic anxiety management techniques should be widespread. It's true that people who dont have debilitating anxiety often say they have anxiety disorders. But anxiety is inherently stressful, and if you've never been taught how to manage stress, it's easy for simple things to feel bigger than how they are. 

It's also important for people to realize their mental health in context, which is less taught. If you're going through a stressful event (like the whole world is during this covid 19 pandemic) then your anxiety is justified. Not just random debilitating anxiety that comes with GAD. 

The important thing though, is everyone experiences stress so I think if we taught people how to mitigate it, we would avoid this to some degree."

Economics,fl991c3,t1_fl49zne,1584945407.0,"Stocks are a small part of the puzzle when it comes to figuring out whether we are in a recession. The reason why people can comfortably say that is there has been a sharp drop in aggregate demand and a sharp increase in unemployment, both which have cyclical effects on one another. 

It's pretty basic supply and demand here but the worst part is supply AND demand are being restricted all at once. So firms are being forced to close, but even if theyre open, they're experiencing a loss in income. It's bad, definitely very bad. 

As far as the job market goes, this is going to impact small businesses and struggling businesses the most. But how bad it will be depends on the ability and willingness for consumers to spend after this blows over. Also, even once the government lifts its restrictions consumers may not feel comfortable going out, depending on how prevalent the virus still is. 

Unemployment is a gamble at this point. We could see a comeback if over the next month we are able to control the spread of the virus, and ease restrictions. But its possible that if people continue to get sick rapidly it will damage the job market for the next few years. One thing is for certain, is that this virus is going to kill a lot of industries and make lots of changes to technology."

I got diagnosed with an anxiety and mood disorder, and started medication and therapy. It wasnt overnight but I started to reconnect with things that made me happy, and managed the bad days. 

In order for that to happen though, there was a lot of introspection that I had to do. It may feel all of the sudden but try to think if anything might be adding to your anxiety, see if there are any triggers. If not, that's okay. You're not broken, this isnt cause for you to make any major life changes.

""Obviously part of the negotiation would include the fact that any collection would have to be removed from your credit report"" 

I have worked in collections- there are two reasons why this is stupid. One, the company has every legal right to put a mark on your credit report, and few companies will pay for the hassle. Two, if I was the person collecting on your account and you said the only way you would pay is if it was removed from your credit report, unless it was the original amount paid in full, I'd send for legal action against you and wash my hands of it tbh. 

You don't have the upper hand here, you owe a debt and you need to negotiate upfront or take the hit to your credit and (possibly) save money on the back end. Also ""making it a pain in the butt"" for the collections agency won't help you.

I reccomend starting at a little closer to 1500-1600, then slowly cutting the calories down over two weeks. That way it gives you an opportunity to see if after a certain point you feel bad/better, etc. 

Also look at what your calories are. Are you getting enough protein and fat? Are you having a high amount of sugar? High amount of caffeine?

It might take longer than 30-45 minutes but that's about it. If its extensive/factory warranty service then you have a different story but the best way to go about it is to call in advance and see if they can help you."
personalfinance,fawcddj,t1_fawbdu2,1576369014.0,"Nope, my contract says I will be paying $1124 in interest. It's a 60 month term (5 years), and the only reason I did more than 4 years was because I liked the idea of having a low payment in case something happened and I couldn't pay extra that month. 

It's not a cheap car, and you're probably right that a cheaper car for cash would suit better. I just work for a dealership and got a really good deal on a car I enjoy."
personalfinance,fawaxkr,t1_faw9ko6,1576368391.0,"Nah,the car is something I'm not willing to sell. I wouldnt mind paying it off but it's a 2015 VW Jetta with all the bells and whistles and only 20k miles. It also has a bumper to bumper 5 year 100k warranty. The going price for something like that starts at $12k so I have positive equity and I also really like my car. 

I pay $166 a month so I'm comfortable with the payments."
personalfinance,faw6080,t1_faw5mrf,1576366434.0,"Will do, is it better to use my savings to pay off the loans and then pay my savings back or just pay extra each month?

I.e pay 300/month over the next 2 years on my student loans or just use my savings and pay it off?"

Advice,f8daqj9,t1_f8d4xxb,1574483631.0,Helped. I will start with getting a small energy efficient space heater for night time and let them know I'll pay for any increase outside our normal and go from there. If it doesnt help then looks like I'll spend an extra $50~ for a balmy 68-69

mildlyinteresting,f48pvpy,t1_f47jt5v,1571445532.0,"In order for you to get a free drink you need 150 stars which is about $75. Most drinks stop at around $7 even with add shots and/or alternative milk. 10% of $75 is pretty much the same as a free drink, if not more depending on what you drink. 

You're getting the same thing, just paid out differently.

bipolar,f2kd0oq,t1_f2euo4x,1570283928.0,"This sounds 100% spot on, I know she just wants to connect with someone about it. But it does feel bad to feel like BPD's less bad cousin when my mental illness has its own independent kind of treatment and struggles. 

I think at the end of the day I end up feeling like she thinks she knows all of my emotions and that's frustrating. I'm going to try to have an open conversation about how mania is a little different experience and how our therapists might say different things but if they help us then it doesnt matter. 

Thank you for taking the time to work through the situation and share your experience, I know BPD is difficult to manage and in a lot of ways worse than what I experience I cant imagine having both."
bipolar,f2kb4u6,t1_f2fcxmb,1570283398.0,"My situation is definitely not that bad, and I'm so sorry your mother felt the need to do that. But they definitely make it so easy to feel like your feelings arent valid. The whole reason I made this post is anytime I share about my mental illness she nitpicks my therapist and the people in my group therapy and the meds I'm on. Asks me why I havent tried wellbutrin with xyz meds because its just the best etc. 

Also I know she has it worse than I do, but she still hurts people and has a hard time being accountable. I want her to get better I just dont want to feel like my illness is BPD's less bad cousin. I still experience things and they're not just a ""slower version"" of BPD they are 2 separate things and our treatment is gonna look different"
