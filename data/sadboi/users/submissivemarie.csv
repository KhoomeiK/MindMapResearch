AskReddit,epeqjhx,t3_bujgas,1559185840.0,"I haven't left my house in about 2 years besides maybe going to the grocery store once a month because my car isn't running and I have to rely on my boyfriend to let me use his car. And I use the term boyfriend very lightly.  I'm basically on house arrest.  I get yelled at for everything, lost my friends, family hardly talks to me. Kind of just started to let it sink in today that I'll be stuck here for a while. So I've been pretty pissed about this for, well, 2 years. Just kind of settled today though that this is basically it for me. First comment I've ever made and I gotta tell you it feels good to get this off my chest."
