EDAnonymous,fnkt56s,t1_fnkswwz,1587039211.0,"oh :( I knew that they wouldnâ€™t help me lose weight or anything, but I hate the feeling of being full but I guess hereâ€™s not point if they take hours to work, when I would probably feel better than right after a binge. Youâ€™re right. Thank you for commenting and helping me understand better."
