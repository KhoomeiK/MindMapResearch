BipolarSOs,fr1ub71,t3_gkxxuv,1589826073.0,"I’m the bipolar one in my relationship, and my boyfriend catches me making comments too. How I think about it is I have very little control over my emotions and thoughts, and I’m trying to break the habit of saying my thoughts. I’ve realized that they are not always rational, and come from a place of heightened emotion or sensitivity. Honestly from your comments, I think he was jealous that his child seems to want you more than it wants him, and he made a comment instead of saying that. It’s also an impulse control issue for me of not knowing when to not say something and when to bite my tongue. I’m sorry it’s hurting you and you’re doing more in the relationship than he is. That’s not okay to put all of the responsibilities on you unless he’s explicitly communicated that he is in an episode and absolutely *needs* you to. In my situation, the more communication the better, even if it sometimes feels unnecessary."

I was angry at everyone for reasons that didn’t exist, I would scream and smash things and then want to kill myself. It was a super turbulent horrible time, and if I had parents that understood mental illness I would’ve been institutionalized. The blocking out if what caused me to seek out help. I’m glad you got help and made it out, having all of this happen during my formative years just makes me feel like I’ve lost those years, I wonder who I would’ve been and what decisions I would have made if my brain wasn’t hardwired this way, and I had any idea what was going on with me. Did you have the sense from a super young age that *something* was wrong but you had no idea? I have always known I’m deep down not normal, but I thought it was me being a bad, uncontrollable person until I was diagnosed. Thank you so much for responding"

I’m not sure what my academic writing would look like while I’m stable - probably not as altruistic. I wrote about UN peacekeeping missions in Africa and the way to make them better which I’m submitting for a journal, and then I was published by my school for my paper on how miscegenation laws prevent social integration at colleges. I don’t think I would have had the giant ideas I did without my hypomania, which scares me for the future being on meds.

I’ve been taking it for 3 weeks and honestly I can’t tell a huge difference and am still cycling but the intensity is slowing going down a tad.
bipolar,foz477g,t1_foyp111,1588184399.0,Your first paragraph could’ve been written by me. I’ve never seen it so clearly worded how I would cycle and why I thought I was cycling because of me being a bad person.
bipolar,foz1wmf,t3_gabt51,1588183268.0,"Same, I’ve been nonstop thinking about this since yesterday for some reason. I can’t shake it even though I have been diagnosed and medicine is helping and I’ve ruined all of my friendships relationships and credit score I still can’t stop questioning"
BipolarReddit,foyddlb,t1_fox7qgu,1588170459.0,"I’m currently on abilify and trazadone but I need to talk to my doctor about med changes. Yeah that’s the hard part, everything feels soooo *important* when it just really isn’t at all and I don’t see that till days and days later. Thank you for your response!!"
BipolarReddit,foxxb18,t1_fox70o1,1588159414.0,"Honestly I lucked out and found a really good therapist online! I would look at psychologytoday.com and you can search by area, price, insurance, gender, disorder, etc. I also looked for someone certified in DBT in case that becomes necessary to do later on. LPC’s and LCSW’s tend to be less expensive and take more insurances than psychologists as well, I’m currently seeing an LPC and I’ve seen an LCSW in the past."
BipolarReddit,foxx0q8,t1_foxwy71,1588159148.0,Thank you so much!!
BipolarReddit,fox0eb8,t1_fowyefn,1588131112.0,"Thank you so much for your response this is so helpful! If you don’t mind one more question, you can experience both hypomania and mania right? Because from your description my “regular” (when I’m not depressed which usually lasts shorter periods of time) is hypomania but there have definitely been periods of my life where I’ve done the things you described for mania"
BipolarReddit,fowreao,t1_fowqby0,1588125540.0,The firecrackers is a really really good way of explaining that feeling I know what you’re talking about. That’s a good indicator too that I should look out for. Thank you for your response!
BipolarReddit,fowls0y,t3_g9t6c1,1588122289.0,"I really loved Rue in Euphoria. It was very triggering though, the fights with her and the mom made me bawl every time because I felt so guilty for what I have put mine through. For me it was a very real portrayal of my life but I also have a very addictive personality."
BipolarReddit,fowl9we,t1_fowkixi,1588122003.0,"See that’s how I feel like I always am when I’m not depressed, but im still trying to find the right medication. I’m also prone to mixed episodes so sometimes I wake up feeling regular good and then spiral into anger later in the day. I really just wish I didn’t have so many damn emotions haha"
BipolarReddit,fowk14v,t1_fowgpzv,1588121292.0,"Ha I appreciate this. I struggle with thinking I am stable versus feeling too good. I can’t think of the better parts of my life where I wasn’t experiencing hypomania or mania, so it’s been difficult figuring out that I am in fact not stable when I once thought I was if that makes sense"
BipolarReddit,fowjv6q,t3_g9yyg1,1588121201.0,"I neeeeeed to build a flight response. Yeah I need to talk to my psychiatrist about different med options. Thank you for validating this, it’s definitely something that I feel is out of my control."
BipolarReddit,fou2qwu,t3_g9gysv,1588074528.0,"I’ve been smoking at least a gram or two a day! It actually made me jumpstart teletherapy because I know I cannot keep spending my money like this and this cannot keep being my coping mechanism. I also have an addictive personality, it’s very difficult."
BipolarReddit,foobsj3,t1_foo7txp,1587936199.0,"Exactly!! I decided I was really into skincare and facials and could be a facialist and now I have a giant skincare routine that I don’t do when depressed. And the debt to see for it! Haha. I hope the CBD flower works, weed works for me emotions wise but just wrecks my productivity. I hope you find something that works for you!!"
BipolarReddit,foo3fjj,t1_foo2xtz,1587931738.0,This. Exactly this. I’m literally thinking about another bachelors degree right now. It’s so damn frustrating to feel like all of my efforts are for nothing. At least we’re not alone :(
BipolarReddit,foo35ia,t1_fonvg6k,1587931583.0,"Ugh I can’t imagine how hard that is to be rapid cycling and feel like that. Mine last for at least a few months, but I’m always so sad when I realize I have no passion for what I once had SO MUCH passion for. It also seriously messes up my life because I take action and spend money for months on these new career ideas (I currently have 5 LSAT books with no intention of going to law school) and it all just turns out wrong within a few months. It’s all so frustrating but I’m just praying to get on the right medication to sort this shit out. Good luck to you!"
mentalillness,fon2cuc,t3_g8e5ze,1587910601.0,"This sounds like my experience when I was living undiagnosed with bipolar disorder. I would suggest taking a good free test online and then talking with your family doctor if the results look that way, until you can find a good psychiatrist to work with. You could also try telemedicine right now, they do from any state and are really good psychiatrists. You could check out psychologytoday.com to find ones on your insurance doing telemedicine from a city. Message me if you need anything!"
