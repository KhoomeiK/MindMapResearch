Perhaps a controversial topic, but funerals can very well be an event of both grateful grief and joyful laughter. Celebration of a wonderful and full life.

If Depression threatens to crash your amazing mother's party, she knows it's not invited. An impossibility to refuse regreting sharing what the future may have held with her, but she's with you none the less.

Support is here with us slumps and in every crack and crevice around you; especially from your mother :)

Hear that? She's egging you on and continues to love you and is proud of your fight against depression and everything you've done; she can't wait to see you do more.

Remember, you're strong as hell **<3**"
AskReddit,eojzbqw,t3_brzuwa,1558644970.0,"*Quick preface; Thank you from the bottom of our hearts/bottles/wells for bringing this to light. While there have been other analogous posts, this subject should be continually resurfaced.*

Are they aware that the old adage ""Walk a mile in someone's shoes"" is an impossibility? 

Best exemplified by the difference to be found between Empathy and Sympathy, it's unfortunate in ways that complete understanding is unattainable. 

Perhaps this is even further confounded by the fact there are no outward signs of injury or struggle to the utterly consuming VISCERAL PAIN / ABJECT TERROR / SELF-HATRED / PALPABLE SORROW. All of which, despite fighting it every waking moment, is UNESCAPABLE. 

Two commonly toted, yet disparate phrases are: ""Just \_\_\_, you're being (lazy, stupid, unreasonable, etc. ) "" or conversely by therapists: ""It's not you, it's your disorder"". The truth lies between these statements. When cognitive distortions are rampant, they take on personality, hopes, motivations, ethical code, only to mangle them and use as a whip by which to torture their owner.

Accept help.

You deserve it, it might not **^(e v e r)** feel like the case, but you're worthy. 

You've got this, you're more than this, you're much stronger than you know <3"
