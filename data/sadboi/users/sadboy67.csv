For me, it was when I faced my thoughts and talked to myself about them out loud I found how ridiculous they were. Hearing how little evidence there was in that the bad things I would think were true, or how little significance they had made me realize my thoughts were not all that bad. I knew I did all of the things then to escape the thoughts because I was scared of facing thembut once I did I started to see what joy I could find in the littler things in life for once. Of course that's just me, but it's worth a try even if it takes multiple, you got this! Trust me, this took me years to get to."

depression,fn5dw3y,t1_fn50dcl,1586662321.0,"Adding on with some advice I heard from my therapist, ""Life will never get better if you keep telling yourself that. Make it a little better whenever you can, and if you can appreciate yourself trying, you will get better."" This has inspired me to go to the gym for the first time, start eating a little bit more, and get my homework in a little less late. With practice makes perfect, but of course I'm not perfect. I haven't gone to the gym in months, my assignments have been late, but with all that work I put in over 2 years I was too stubborn to let myself go all the way horrible as I was before. I'm still depressed and anxious, but stubborn to also be better. 

Another thing that helps me through this is this one quote I don't remember word for word, but something like ""Happiness and sadness can coexist. One does not have to be absent to feel the other"" and it helped me accept that I can be depressed, maybe forever but I could always also sometimes be happy and just bc I happen to be depressed too doesn't make my happiness worth less.

TL;DR: Time alone cannot heal anything, there's also practice and growth and especially change of attitude. There has to be an okayness with hitting bumps in the road to recovery, with the stubborness of not letting your progress die in vain &keep going. Acceptance in allowing your happiness to exist at the same time as your depression doesn't make your happiness less ""genuine."""

Reid, for his nerdy charisma which gets me every time.
JJ, for being an excellent mother and a level-headed agent through it all especially having to keep her head in just reviewing cases.
Rossi, I just love his big man energy. He's such a soothing character, and I think that the BAU would've had lower spirits without him. He sticks out to me for all the times he's lifted up the agents when they're feeling down or uncertain, or feeling distracted with the best advice.
Morgan, he's genuine and true and sticks out for his loyalty. I adore him for being Penelope's (again, another character I truly love) crutch and main support through this all but also for the unbiased care and attention he gives to many. His clear morals and unspoken bravery...

I also got my hair stuck in Justin Timberlake's zipper once due to my shortness as a kid. We were taking a picture together.

And another one, I was in a Target commercial as a kid but the screen stops panning right where I am dancing, so you see a split second of my hair before it cuts to the next part of the commercial. Still got paid $2700 for it though. 

Last one before I think of more, in elementary school I was a new kid from another elementary school and even though I acted shy I used that and joined a group of ""mean"" girls, kicked out the leader, and became the leader before moving schools again. Definitely not the same now."
