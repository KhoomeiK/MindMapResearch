sugarlifestyleforum,fqxl156,t3_gladou,1589733940.0,"Thank you so much for sharing. Any type of relationship can be difficult when we aren’t mentally stable. Once you’re grounded in yourself it’s a lot easier to give attention and connection to someone else because we aren’t distracted by our insecurities constantly. It can also help keep our boundaries so we do what’s good or healthy for us and not what might put a bandaid on deep scars. 

But don’t feel like you’re missing out! It will always be here and it’s most important to take care of yourself self first. You’re important! Stay strong ❤️"
PurplePillDebate,fqpa2dd,t1_fqp9ex3,1589540321.0,"You can have a family take care of the children and not be in a monogamous relationship. I agree that it’s important for the child to have their parents in their lives and consistency. It’s ultimately the priority of the parents to take care of their children whether they’re together or not. Their relationship status should not get in the way of that if they are devoted to taking care of their child. It’s definitely different for everyone though depending on what they want.

So what? Do you really need someone else’s approval to make your life feel worthy? If it comes and it works that’s great. But if it doesn’t it’s not the end of the world and life goes on. That not the only way to have a relationship. There is no “right way”."

But I can see how the upper class would stick to monogamy since they have a lot of exposure which might lead to pressure to conform to social norms.

Also sex does not have to be connected to raising children. Most young people that have casual sex don’t want children. What should be linked to having children is proper protection.

Also idk what you’re on about blaming women or men for. Pretty sure it’s a collective issue of thinking in general. (That is if it’s even an ‘issue’)"

I plan to go to graduate school and get my PhD so I still have many years of school left. Although, don’t let that hold you back because there are many people that are in the same boat. It is doable to be able to make payments and it is possible to have them paid off. And to me, getting an education that could lead me to a stable job is the most important so I’m willing to do what it takes. 

I looked through your profile a bit and I really resonate with you on your situation. I grew up in a family where both parents were a suite physically, mentally, and emotionally. I’ve been through sexual abuse and lot of other trauma have impacted my mental well being. I didn’t know what to do and nobody fully understood my situation because I was able to keep myself together. Everything looked okay on the outside but on the inside I was dying of depression upon other mental issues. When I graduated highschool I secretly packed up all my stuff and left them. I’ve had no contact with them since then and it’s been the best decision I have ever made in my life. I was able to actually be myself, live my life, be around people I loved, and get the help that I needed. 

I’m really sorry about the position that you’re in. I understand. It’s more than scary, it’s a nightmare but outside of all of that there is a world out there for people that love you and will love you and care for you. 

You should not feel bad about however long you choose to sugar. I’m glad that I’m able to do it because it gives me more time to focus on school when finding a steady job is difficult. There is no right or wrong but do what feel right *for you*. Find a balance that works for you, work towards your goals, and keep your eyes open for other opportunities that can bring you forward. 

When I was in your position I did a lot of reading on my parents behaviors and my own. The subreddit I would go on a lot was r/narccisticparents. I read books on mentally ill parents and learned more about what that meant for them and brought me closer as to why they acted the way they did and how it affects me. My parents blocked me from any therapy or medication so being self aware of what was happening around me helped me stay as sane as I could be. I wrote in my diary a lot also because it helped me unpack everything I was feeling even if people around me didn’t understand. 

I’m so sorry for the long post but I just want you to know that there is hope for you and what you’re going through will not last forever although it can feel that way."

The money I get from sugaring helps pay for that, make small payments towards my loans, and save. Much more than I would earn at a part time job. It works for me for now but I understand that it’s not 100% solid. If I happen to find a job that goes towards my career experience, pays well, and can fit in my school schedule (which tbh is hard to find) then I would totally do it and ease on sugaring."

Yes I’ve been sugaring because it wasn’t much different from what I was doing before (hookups). I enjoy doing it since it’s mutually beneficial and has less drama. I end up being drawn to guys that are older or more mature anyway so it works well. It also helps me pay for school. Although, I’ve been wanting to date someone for a very long time and would drop sugaring to be able to.

I personally don’t think that my standards are high but it might be to others. Basically, I want to be able to talk to them everyday and be able to spend time (and not just for sex). Having trust, open communication, and boundaries is really important to me. I get that there are a lot of other things going on someone else’s life than just me so I’d want to give them the space they need and have that reciprocated.

I had a lot of unresolved trauma on top of other diagnoses was dealing with.
morbidquestions,fomg6u4,t3_g76x32,1587888841.0,"What was your childhood like? I was raped when I was young and for a long amount of time I had a strong fantasy of wanting to get raped even though I knew it was wrong and demeaning. 

I’ve been fascinated with gore because it’s just interesting. You wonder how that happens to a person or what certain things look like. You learn about all the dark stuff no one ever tells you about. It’s just looking at something that’s so horrible you can’t look away. 

So that being said I spent a lot of my younger life wondering if I was weird while I was exploring and looking at a lot of weird shit. It could be a phase but you really just don’t know. 

BUT if you eventually start wanting to be the perpetrator of the things you see (hurting or killing another person for pleasure) I would get help sooner than later.  

You also don’t have to wait to go into therapy. Anyone going through anything from ‘normal’ life to distressing new events can go. It’s a good way to ease stress, learn more about yourself, and being able to do it in a safe place. You can share what makes you feel comfortable. If you don’t like it you can always stop and if you come back to a point that you think you’d like it or need it you can go back."
morbidquestions,fomep8n,t3_g7wt25,1587887321.0,"Yes (although I think the younger they are the even more unlikely it would be). I don’t think it matters the age but if someone is actively trying to change someone to be more isolated, dependent on them, and distrusting of everyone else it’s a hugeeee red flag. 

Usually we hear of older people manipulating younger people because the level of maturity is not the same so the younger person does not fully understand or perceive what is going on."

morbidquestions,fomdxho,t3_g845xc,1587886552.0,"I’m pretty sure you have the right to refuse treatment but it would be easier if you just complied. Try the medications before you choose not to take them because it can help. And make sure to wait at least a little over a month before you stop—just try and see if it helps you. 

What does your psychiatrist tell you well you say you don’t feel comfortable taking medication? 

If you were a threat to others or yourself, your psychiatrist would not hesitate to wait it out to put you in a facility. He might have been trying to say that things might get worse and if they do you might end up in a facility."

You never think about how much you enjoy breathing freely until you get a cold."
