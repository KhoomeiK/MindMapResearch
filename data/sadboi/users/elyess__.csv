I've been diagnosed years ago. Having a BP partner is like a torture I understand, it's really up to you if you want to keep trying or just move on, it's not your fault."

thank you for the effort you have put on writing this!"
Anxiety,f84cf98,t3_dyri47,1574240993.0,"lacks of sleep or not having a quality sleep might trigger anxiety in a way or another. From my own experience, I'm mouth breathing because of nose malformation that require a surgery. I also breath with my chest. I don't have apnea so yay.

my doctor explored those routes at first and I learned some breathing exercises that helped me calm down my anxiety and panic attacks. but in the end he decided it's only a small part of my issues.

so yeah, a doctor who doesn't jump right into prescriptions and pills for me is a good one. and it might be just that."
