evangelion,fbjp1su,t3_edq9za,1576937619.0,The basics are that Death(True) aka Death and Rebirth is a recap film and can be skipped and that the most important film is End of Evangelion. Once you have finished End of Eva you may choose to watch the Rebuild Series if films which are basically theatrical retelling with some big changes and better animation.
