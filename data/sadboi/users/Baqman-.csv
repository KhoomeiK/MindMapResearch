I recently bought an echo auto for my car. Mainly for music. I hoped I would get the same music library as the echo dot I have at home since I’m already paying for the extended library. 
Unfortunately, I noticed that sometimes when I tell Alexa to play a specific song, Alexa says something along the lines of “here is a playlist based on the song you requested” and it doesn’t actually play that same song. Even though, if I request the same song from my echo dot, it will play it

I am just wondering if there’s something I missed during the set up? Or if this is how it’s designed to work."

I have many friends, neighbors, coworkers, siblings and relatives. We are in touch every single day.
They see me as a person who is always positive. The person who always sees the good in every situation. They think I’m hopeful and lively. They come to me when they’re having problems. 
For gods sake, I am a physician! I counsel people about depression all the time. I treat them and make referrals. I connect them with counselors. I understand how the system works. I know what’s available. 
But when it comes to me.... I do nothing. I carry the weight on my shoulders. I’m in bed as soon as I get home until I have to go to work again. I eat once a day. Sometimes a protein shake serves as my meal.
I feel a black cloud hovering over my head. I like to think that the deeper I am in depression, the bigger the cloud gets. And I picture myself, dragging a cloud so big, you can’t even see its top. I like to think that someone, someday, will finally be able to see it, and see how I am still able to smile. I hope they’ll think that what I do every day is extraordinary. And I guess that is what keeps me going."
