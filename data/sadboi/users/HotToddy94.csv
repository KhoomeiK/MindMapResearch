Thank you! These are cherry, grape, and sweet heart. They taste very good, and I'm not much of a tomato person. I think maybe I'm just not a store bought tomato person. 

Hmm ... Lessons learned... (1) I think next time I'll give them more space. Not that I think they were crowded but that it was hard to get to the red ones in the center without moving the plants quite a bit, which made several not ripe ones fall off. And (2) I think next time I'm just going to have more fun. A granny got snarky with me about having planted too early, which made me kind of lose the happy for a few weeks. But obviously I was fine.

communication,fq5su5g,t1_fq5gco2,1589116517.0,"This website has a ton, if interested. https://www.communicationtheory.org/list-of-theories/

The information is correct, but not perfectly written. I get the feeling several of the writers don't speak English as a first language, but you can easily get concepts. 

To play on your leftist heart strings, check out face negotiation theory, muted group theory, and the spiral of silence. I know for two of those you can look them up on YouTube and watch an interview with the theorist explaining it, which I think is neat and helpful (I retain nada when just reading).

In regards to having just one theory, I couldn't really answer that. I think comm (and therapy!) make you so much more aware of yourself and others that I think about it or am influenced by it all the time. ""It"" being the study. I think it's socialized me into a different person. So, I'm not sure what one theory I find most helpful."
communication,fq2x8k2,t3_ggepcx,1589060909.0,"I went to Ball State University for comm (bs & ma), and highly recommend you check out their program descriptions to get a better understanding of the field. There are a lot of branches, bc the field is highly influenced by others. For example, we had people who wanted to go into politics, writing, psychology, teaching, and business.

I was in the business tract, so for me, I describe my courses as teaching me to be a great employee. I learned a lot about leadership, management, working with people different than me, org culture, and solving org problems. My professor gave this description of comm studies, and perhaps it will help you: 

If you're a doctor, and your patient has a headache, you give them 2 Advil. But if one of those Advil isn't working at 100% bc its planning to quit in 2 weeks and the other isn't working at 100% bc its sleeping with the boss and doesn't need to work so hard, your 2 Advil aren't going to do what you expected. A comm professional can diagnose what is happening and take appropriate steps to remedy the imperfectness of people. The goal isn't so much to make people fit the ""pill"", where if they don't fit they get cut. That's more of a MBA perspective. The goal is to create a system where people want to work at 100%, but we have to understand them as people to do so."

My answer is that I think Linda and Teddy are actually best friends. She puts so much effort into getting Beddy to happen, but Linda and Teddy are always eager to hang out. 

She taught him to dance. They dyed everything green together. They talked about the bake sale and gossiped together. Even though he loves Linda in a romantic way, I think really they're just super good friends. More so than Bob and Teddy. And I think Linda might be Teddy's only real friend.
